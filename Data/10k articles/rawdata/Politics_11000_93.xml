The '''1960 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference''' was the tenth [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference|Meeting]] of the [[List of Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It was held in the [[United Kingdom]] in May 1960, and was hosted by that country's [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Harold Macmillan]].

This was the first Commonwealth conference since [[Federation of Malaya|Malayan]] independence in August 1957 and saw the growing importance of the non-white  "[[New Commonwealth]]" countries. Malaya's prime minister, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] and his government vigorously opposed the [[apartheid]] policies of [[South Africa]] and, with the support of Pakistan, India and Ghana, demanded that the issue be addressed by the Commonwealth. However, Macmillan insisted that the final communique could only include matters on which the leaders were unanimous.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=n2pYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7DsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5117,2623971&amp;dq=commonwealth+prime+ministers+malaya&amp;hl=en]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ghana]] advised the meeting that it would be becoming a republic and South Africa advised that it would be holding a [[South African republic referendum, 1960|referendum]] on the issue. Ghana was advised that its continued membership in the Commonwealth as a republic was recognised, however, South Africa was advised that it would need to seek consent of other Commonwealth governments for its membership to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vciLoneE8GYC&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;ots=WJHfUWpEAq&amp;dq=commonwealth%20prime%20ministers%201960&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Commonwealth at the Summit: Communiqu√©s of Commonwealth Heads of ... - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Agrarian Union of the Landless''' ({{lang-lv|Bezzemnieku agrƒÅrƒÅ savienƒ´ba}}, BAS) was a political party in [[Latvia]] in the early 1920s.

==History==
The party won three seats in the [[Latvian Constitutional Assembly election, 1920|1920 Constitutional Assembly elections]].&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip St√∂ver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1137 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the elections it was largely absorbed into the [[Latvian Farmers' Union]], but continued to exist as a separate faction within the Union.&lt;ref name=VM&gt;Vincent E McHale (1983) ''Political parties of Europe'', Greenwood Press, p456 {{ISBN|0-313-23804-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1925 a breakaway from the Farmers' Union led to the establishment the [[New Farmers-Small Landowners Party]], which had its roots in the BAS. The more radical BAS members remained in the Farmers' Union until 1928, when they also left to join the New Farmers-Small Landowners Party. In 1931 the more radical members left the party to establish the [[New Farmers' Association]],&lt;ref name=VM/&gt; which won two seats in the [[Latvian parliamentary election, 1931|1931 elections]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64784">The '''Ark of Taste''' is an international catalogue of endangered [[Food heritage|heritage]] [[food]]s which is maintained by the global [[Slow Food]] movement. The Ark is designed to preserve at-risk foods that are [[Sustainable farming|sustainably produced]], unique in [[taste]], and part of a distinct [[ecoregion]]. Contrary to the most literal definition of plant and animal [[conservation ethic|conservation]], the Ark of Taste aims to maintain edibles in its purview by actively encouraging their cultivation for consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/dining/30come.html?sq=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=An Unlikely Way to Save a Species: Serve It for Dinner |last=Severson |first=Kim |date=April 30, 2008 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; By doing so, Slow Food hopes to promote the growing and eating of foods which are sustainable and preserve [[biodiversity]] in the human food chain.

Foods included in the list are intended to be "culturally or historically linked to a specific region, locality, ethnicity or traditional production practice",&lt;ref&gt;Ark of Taste, slowfoodusa.org&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to being rare. Which foods meet these criteria is decided by an adjudicating committee made up of members of the Slow Food nonprofit organization; all candidates go through a formal nomination process which includes tastings and identification of producers within the region.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, Nov. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the foundation of the Ark in 1996, 4866 products (October 2018) from over 149 countries have been included and growing daily. The list includes not only prepared foods and food products, but also a great many [[livestock]] breeds, as well as vegetable and fruit [[cultivar]]s. All foods in the catalogue are accompanied by a list of resources for those wishing to grow or buy them.

'''Blackacre''', '''Whiteacre''', '''Greenacre''', '''Brownacre''', and variations are the [[placeholder name]]s used for fictitious [[estate (law)|estates in land]].

The names are used by professors of [[law]] in [[common law]] jurisdictions, particularly in the area of [[real property]] and occasionally in [[contracts]], to discuss the rights of various parties to a piece of land. A typical [[law school]] or [[bar exam]] question on real property might say:

{{quotation|Adam, owner of a [[fee simple]] in Blackacre, conveyed the property "to Bill for life, [[future interest|remainder]] to Charles, provided that if any person should consume alcohol on the property before the first born son of Charles turns twenty-one, then the property shall go to Dwight in fee simple." Assume that neither Bill, Charles, nor Dwight is an heir of Adam, and that Adam's only heir is his son, Edward. Discuss the ownership interests in Blackacre of Adam, Bill, Charles, Dwight and Edward.}}

Where more than one estate is needed to demonstrate a point{{spaced ndash}}perhaps relating to a dispute over boundaries, [[easement]]s or [[riparian rights]]{{spaced ndash}}a second estate will usually be called Whiteacre,&lt;ref&gt;''Black‚Äôs Law Dictionary'', ‚Äúblackacre‚Äù{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a third, Greenacre, and a fourth, Brownacre.

==Origin==
[[Jesse Dukeminier]], author of one of the leading series of [[textbook]]s on property, traces the use of Blackacre and Whiteacre for this purpose to a 1628 treatise by Sir [[Edward Coke]]. Dukeminier suggests that the term might originate with references to colors associated with certain [[agriculture|crops]] ("[[peas]] and [[beans]] are black, [[cereal|corn]] and [[potatoes]] are white, [[hay]] is green"), or with the means by which rents were to be paid, with black rents payable in [[produce]] and white rents in [[silver]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jesse Dukeminier]] and [[James E. Krier]]. ''Property, 5th Ed.''&amp;nbsp; Aspen Law and Business, 2002, p. 160n.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1790 treatise by [[Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet|Francis Buller]] similarly uses these placeholder names, stating: "If A. have Black Acre and C. have White Acre, and A. has a way over White Acre to Black Acre, and then purchases White Acre, the way will be extinct; and if A. afterwards enfeoff C. of White Acre without excepting the road, it is gone".&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet|Francis Buller]], ''An Introduction to the Law Relative to Trials at Nisi Prius'' (1790), page 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate theory is that the term arises from [[American Civil War|Civil War]] policy in which plots of [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] land given to recently [[Abolitionism in the United States|emancipated]] [[African-American]] [[freedmen]] (freed [[slaves]]) during the [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] period under [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]]'s "[[forty acres and a mule]]" policy. Such plots were colloquially called "Blackacres". Since most of the freed slaves were illiterate, many were cheated out of their land through shady loan contracts with former plantation owners.&lt;ref&gt;[[James M. McPherson]] The Struggle for Equality: Abolitionists and the Negro in the Civil War and Reconstruction. Vol. 72. Princeton University Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; These disputes, along with questions of the proper contractual entitlement of the slaves to the land in the first place, provided the basis for the development of modern American [[contract]] and [[property law]] and has come to refer to situations where there exists some contention or ambiguity surrounding the rightful owner or respective rights of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Collier]]. ''On the economic consequences of civil war'' Oxf. Econ. Pap. 1999. [168‚Äì183].&lt;/ref&gt;

In various law journals and treatises in Louisiana, which uses a [[Law of Louisiana|unique form]] of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] influenced by but not identical to the [[Napoleonic Code]], authors have used the term "[[arpent]] noir" as a placeholder name for the purpose of discussing rights concerning immovables.

==In popular culture==

Because of its association with legal education, a number of legal publications and events utilize the name. For example, ''Blackacre'' was adopted as the name of the literary journal at the [[University of Texas School of Law]]. ''Blackacre'' is also the name of a journal at the [[Sydney Law School|University of Sydney Law School]], published annually by the Sydney University Law Society, the name of the open-air courtyard and weekly student social at [[Vanderbilt Law School]], and the name of a [[William Mitchell College of Law]] formal.

The [[Blackacre Nature Preserve and Historic Homestead]] in [[Kentucky]] was so named by the donor of the land, [[Macauley Smith]], who had been a judge on the [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackacrefoundation.org/history.html Blackacre Foundation website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202071832/http://www.blackacrefoundation.org/history.html |date=February 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, a legal humor website wrote an article chronicling the foreclosure sale of Blackacre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120310053314/http://lawsforattorneys.com/2010/07/22/blackacre-sold-in-courthouse-foreclosure-auction Blackacre sold in courthouse foreclosure auction] at LawsForAttorneys (via [[archive.org]]); published  July 22, 2010; archived March 10 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A group of law students in Indianapolis founded a brewery named [[Black Acre Brewing Co.]] in late 2010 as a homage to their legal schooling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blackacrebrewing.com/ BlackAcreBrewing.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monica Youn]]'s 2016 book of poetry from [[Graywolf Press]] is titled ''Blackacre'', in reference to the legal concept (Youn has a law degree from Yale).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/blackacre|title=Blackacre {{!}} Graywolf Press|website=www.graywolfpress.org|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Tsarist and Imperial Russia===

One can trace the origin of the Russian border service to 1571 and the work of Prince [[Mikhail Vorotynsky]] (died 1573) and his [[Great Abatis Border]] built along the southern boundaries of the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in the 16th century.
In 1782 the Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]] established Border Customs Guard units, originally manned by Russian [[Cossacks]] as well as by low-ranking [[cavalry]] troops. In 1810 General [[Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly|Mikhail Barklay de Tolly]] organized numerous border posts along the entire western Russian border, manned by 11 regiments of [[Don Cossacks|Don]] and [[Bug Cossacks]] . Within two years Russian Border Guards became the first to oppose [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia]] (June 1812). In 1832 Cossacks and cavalry were replaced by armed customs officials subordinate to the [[Ministry of Finance]] in peacetime (in wartime the border guards were automatically transferred to the army). In the same year the government of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Emperor Nicholas I]] established a [[coast guard]] - originally to observe coasts of the [[Black Sea]] and of the [[Sea of Azov]].

Count [[Sergei Witte]], the Russian Minister of Finance (1892-1903) in the government of [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] (reigned 1881-1894), reformed the service on 13 October 1893 into the Independent Border Guards Corps (IBGC - a para-military rather than a civilian organization) headed by an army general and reporting directly to the ministry.

In 1906 about 40,000 soldiers and officers served in the IBGC - maintaining the defence of the lengthy Imperial border. They served in 8 division-sized districts as well as in the Saint Petersburg headquarters unit.

===Soviet period===
{{main|USSR Border Troops}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Nkvd 01 bw.jpg|thumb|right|250px|NKVD border guards watching the frontier]] --&gt;
'''Soviet Border Troops''', ({{lang-ru|–ü–æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã–µ –≤–æ–π—Å–∫–∞ –°–°–°–†, Pogranichnyie Voiska SSSR}}) were the [[military|militarized]] [[border guard]] of the [[Soviet Union]], subordinated to its subsequently reorganized [[state security]] agency: first to ''[[Cheka]]''/[[State Political Directorate|OGPU]], then to [[NKVD]]/[[Ministry for State Security (USSR)|MGB]] and, finally, to [[KGB]]. Accordingly, they were known as '''NKVD Border Troops''' and '''KGB Border Troops''' (with [[Russian language|Russian]] abbreviations - ''–ù–ö–í–î –°–°–°–†''/- ''–ö–ì–ë –°–°–°–†'' added on the end of official names). Unlike border guards of many other countries, Soviet Border Troops were a centralized force including also the [[sea|maritime]] border guard units (i.e., a [[coast guard]]).

===Modern period===
[[Image:RIAN archive 942200 Border guards of the Federal Security Service pursuing trespassers of the maritime boundary during exercises in Kaliningrad region.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Border guards of the Federal Security Service in Kaliningrad region, 2011]]
Following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], Federal Border Guard Service of Russia was created on December 30, 1993 as a separate government agency. The agency retained some old traditions, most notably the dark green-colored uniform and "[[Public holidays in Russia|Border Guarder's Day]]" (an official holiday commemorated by celebrations of ex-servicemen). First minister of FBS (Federal Border Service) was [[Andrei Nikolayev (politician)|Andrei Nikolayev]], young and outspoken general who later became deputy of the [[State Duma]]. Russian Border Guards were also stationed outside of Russia most notably in southern [[Tajikistan]], in order to guard the border with [[Afghanistan]], until summer 2005. On Afghan-Tajik border on many occasions they were engaged in heavy fighting with [[Illegal drug trade|drug-traffickers]] and [[Islamic extremists]].  [[Armenia]]'s closed border with [[Turkey]] and open border with [[Iran]] is also still guarded by the Russians. On March 11, 2003, Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] changed the status of Border Guard Service from a separate agency into a branch of Russian [[Federal Security Service]]. The current head of Border Guard Service of Russia is General [[Vladimir Pronichev]]. Border Guard Service of Russia is tasked with a defence of the [[List of countries and territories by land borders|longest national border in the world]].

In April 2012 Vladimir Pronichev announced that the country was planning to build 20 frontier posts in the Arctic region. Reasons for this development can be found in the increased abilities to explore hydrocarbon deposits in the north. It will also give Russia an ability to patrol and service the [[Northern Sea Route]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Russia to create 20 frontier posts in Arctic |url= http://indrus.in/articles/2012/04/16/russia_to_create_20_frontier_posts_in_arctic_15475.html |publisher= Russia &amp; India Report |date= 16 April 2012 |accessdate= 29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 [[Ukraine]] opened a criminal case against the head of the Border Guard Service [[Vladimir Kulishov]]; he was accused of financing ‚Äúillegal military groups‚Äù in [[Eastern Ukraine]] [[2014 insurgency in Donbass|who at the time fought against the]] [[Ukrainian army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wqad.com/2014/07/22/ukraine-calls-businessman-and-russian-defense-minister-accomplices-of-terrorists/|title=Ukraine calls businessman and Russian defense minister ‚Äòaccomplices of terrorists‚Äô|date=22 July 2014|publisher=wqad.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2014-07/05/c_126712597.htm|title=Ukraine opens criminal case against Russian Border Service chief - Xinhua - English.news.cn|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://rupaper.com/post/30752 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728224641/http://rupaper.com/post/30752 |archive-date=2014-07-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Calcium bisulfite''' ('''calcium bisulphite''') is an [[inorganic compound]] which is the [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of a [[calcium]] cation and a [[bisulfite]] anion. It may be prepared by reacting lime with an excess of [[sulfurous acid]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}, essentially a mixture of [[sulfur dioxide]] and water. It is a weak reducing agent, as is sulfur dioxide, [[sulfite]]s, and any other compound containing sulfur in the +4 oxidation state. As a [[food additive]] it is used as a [[preservative]] under the [[E number]] E227.  Calcium bisulfite is an [[acid salt]] and behaves like an acid in aqueous solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1877">'''Class traitor''' is a term used mostly in [[Socialism|socialist]] discourse to refer to a member of the [[proletariat]] class who works directly or indirectly against their class interest, or what is against their economic benefit as opposed to that of the [[bourgeoisie]]. It applies particularly to [[soldier]]s, [[police officer]]s, [[Strikebreaker|workers]] who refuse to respect [[Picketing|picket lines]] during a [[Strike action|strike]] and basically anyone [[Wage labour|paid a wage]] who actively facilitates the ''[[status quo]]''. According to [[Barbara Ehrenreich]]: "Class treason is an option at all socioeconomic levels: from the blue-collar man who becomes a security guard employed to harass striking workers, to the heirs of capitalist fortunes who become donors to left-wing causes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ehrenreich, Barbara|title=Fear of Falling: The Inner Life of the Middle Class|year=1989|pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia before and during the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Bolsheviks]] and other socialist revolutionary organizations used it to describe the [[White movement|Czarist Army]] and basically any working class citizen who directly opposed their notion of the "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]". The term was later extended to include the [[Menshevik|Menshevik Russians]] and other supposedly [[counter-revolutionary]] socialist organizations under [[Joseph Stalin]].

The motives behind becoming a traitor to one's class can include the necessity of survival (taking up whatever wage is available), the belief that the person is of a higher class and so has political views that work against the working class, the pressure of conformity, or a rejection of the view that society is divided up into antagonistic classes.

'''''Commander in Chief''''', also known as '''''Geo-Political-Simulator''''' is a [[government simulation game]] that allows a player to simulate being a nation's [[head of state]]. Players have a large amount of control over their nation{{Weasel inline|date=May 2017}}, although this varies based on the form of government the player's nation has. The English version was released on July 25, 2008, and has also been released in French, German, Spanish and Russian versions. The French version has been named Mission-Pr√©sident.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Mission-Pr%C3%A9sident-Geopolitical-Simulator-French-Pc/dp/B0031MC40I&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
When starting a new game, players may choose between various scenarios, some of which have set objectives while others are more akin to a "sandbox" mode.

Similarly to other government simulation games like [[Democracy (video game)|Democracy]], the player assumes the role of the chief executive of their chosen nation such as the President of the United States of America or the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Unlike in the Democracy series the player may amend the constitution of their chosen state and run it as a dictatorship.

==Inaccuracies==
The game refers to the position of chief executive as "Head of State" which is not true for all states‚Äîfor example, the [[President of the United States]] is the [[Head of State]], but the [[British Prime Minister]] or [[German Chancellor]] are not‚Äîand in the game, the player plays as the chief executive. In many states there is a distinction between the [[Head of Government]] and the [[Head of State]], with the Head of State often being a ceremonial president or monarch. There is also no distinction in the game between any [[upper house|upper]] and [[lower house|lower]] houses of the [[parliament]].

There are also inaccuracies relating to nations in the game, as many nations are misrepresented. For example, the [[Finnish people|Finnish]] are inaccurately portrayed as being culturally Scandinavian, all Finnish have Swedish names when [[Swedish language|Swedish speakers]] only constitute 5.5% of the population. Other inaccuracies relate to the religion. Certain minority religions, such as the Baha'i faith in India, are not represented in the game, nor are pagans of any kind. There are also mistakes relating to ethnicity. For example, all the people of [[Kyrgyzstan]], as opposed to a sizable minority, are represented as being [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] rather than east Asian and also all have Russian names. Similarly, most [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] have Indian names.{{citation needed|date = April 2016}}

The '''Communist Party of the Galician People''' ({{lang-gl|Partido Comunista do Pobo Galego}}, '''PCPG''') is a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] political organization with a [[Communism|communist]] and [[Galician nationalism|independentist]] ideology founded in 1984.

==History==
The PCPG was established in 1984, in parallel to the process of rebuilding unity of the [[pro-soviet]] Spanish communists that was happening across Spain, with the participation of various communist parties, like the [[Party of Communists of Catalonia]] or the [[Unified Communist Party of Spain]], against the prevailing [[eurocommunism]] in the direction of the [[Communist Party of Spain|PCE]] and [[Communist Party of Galicia|PCG]]. This process led to the founding of the Communist Party (PC), the predecessor of which was then [[Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain]] (PCPE).

The PCPG has participated in many elections. Its last participation was in the [[Spanish general election, 2008|general elections 2008]], presenting 3 candidates for the [[Spanish Senate]] in the [[province of Ourense]], obtaining 4,243 (1.04% of the total), 3,428 (0.86%) and 3,413 votes (0.83%) respectively. The party also got 507 votes for the [[Congreso de los Diputados]] (188 in the [[Province of Lugo]] and 319 in the [[Province of Ourense]]).

In 2008 the PCPG broke with the [[Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain|PCPE]] due to their different view of the [[Galician nationalism|Galician national question]].

Since 2007 the PCPG has participated in the [[Cangas Left Alternative]] coalition in [[Cangas do Morrazo]], which since [[Spanish municipal elections, 2015|2015]] governs that municipality.

In 2011 and 2012 the PCPG participated in the Forum for the Galician Communist Unity (FUCG), trying to find the unity of the [[Galician independence|Galician independentist communism]], along with the [[Maoism|maoist]] collective [[Ateneu Prolet√°rio Galego]] and the [[Leninism|classical leninist]] organization [[Forxa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galiciaconfidencial.com/nova/8854-procuran-union-comunismo-independentista Procuran a uni√≥n do comunismo independentista.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014 the party has become closer to the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc]] (BNG). In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Spain)|European elections of 2014]] the party called to vote for The Peoples Decide (a coalition of the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc|BNG]] and various independentist parties from the rest of [[Spain]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bng.gal/blog/2014/05/23/o-bng-quere-agradecer-o-apoio-recibido-a-candidatura-as-eleccions-europeas/ O BNG quere agradecer o apoio recibido √° candidatura √°s Elecci√≥ns europeas.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sermosgaliza.gal/articulo/politica/xose-collazo-pobo-galego-ten-ter-forza-represente-europa-forza-bng/20140520211145027511.html Xos√© Collazo, do PCPG: ‚ÄúO pobo galego ten que ter unha forza que o represente en Europa e esa forza √© o BNG‚Äù.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Spanish municipal elections, 2015|2015 local elections]] the PCPG called to vote the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc|BNG]] candidatures. Various PCPG members joined some lists of the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc|BNG]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pcdopg.blogspot.com.es/2015/05/o-pcpg-sobre-as-proximas-eleicions.html O PCPG SOBRE AS PR√ìXIMAS ELEICI√ìNS MUNICIPAIS DO 24 DE MAIO.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In  the [[Spanish general election, 2015|general elections of 2015]] the party joined Us-Galician Candidacy, a coalition led by the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc]], that got the 4.32% of the vote. In the same elections the general secretary of the party run as a candidate for the [[Spanish senate]] in the [[Province of Pontevedra]], getting 31,375 votes (2.08% of the total), failing to win a seat.

{{Political corruption sidebar|image=[[File:Flag of Kenya.svg|150 px]]}}
'''Corruption in the post-colonial [[politics of Kenya|government of Kenya]]''' has a history which spans the era of the [[Jomo Kenyatta]] and [[Daniel arap Moi]]'s [[Kenya African National Union|KANU]] governments, [[Mwai Kibaki]]'s [[Party of National Unity (Kenya)|PNU]] government and the current [[Uhuru Kenyatta]]'s [[Jubillee Party]] government. In the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] 2012 [[Kenya]] is ranked 139th out of 176 countries for corruption, tied with [[Azerbaijan]], [[Nepal]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Pakistan]] (least corrupt countries are at the top of the list).&lt;ref name="Frequently Asked Questions"&gt;[[Transparency International|Transparency International Kenya]], ''[http://www.tikenya.org/faqs.asp Frequently Asked Questions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219102648/http://www.tikenya.org/faqs.asp |date=19 February 2006 }}''. Accessed 1 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most bribes paid by urban residents in Kenya are fairly small but large ones are also taken&amp;nbsp;‚Äì bribes worth over 50,000 [[Kenyan shilling]]s ([[Euro|‚Ç¨600]], US$700) account for 41% of the total value. There is also corruption on a larger scale with each of the last two regimes being criticised for their involvement.&lt;ref name="Frequently Asked Questions"/&gt;

Despite market reforms, several business surveys reveal that business corruption is still widespread and that companies frequently encounter demands for bribes and informal payments to 'get things done' in Kenya. The public procurement sector in Kenya suffers widespread corruption. The use of agents to facilitate business operations and transactions in Kenya is widespread and poses a risk for companies, particularly at the market entry and business start-up stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keny Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/kenya/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite positive developments, the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission (KACC) was disbanded in 2011 and replaced by the newly instated Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. Observers describe the new agency as superficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenya Corruptiony Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/kenya/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate= 14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption scandals==

===Before 1990===
* The first corruption incident in Kenya is widely regarded as the Ngei maize scandal of 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/1144005108/maize-scandals-a-sign-of-immaturity|title=Maize scandals a sign of immaturity|last=Standard|first=The|work=The Standard|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Ngei]], an independence hero and at the time the Minister for Marketing and Cooperatives, was involved in a maize scandal that caused a national maize shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/dn2/Ngei-suspended-over-maize-scam/957860-1922204-f7io0tz/index.html|title=Ngei suspended over maize scam|work=Daily Nation|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission of Maize Inquiry, the first of its kind in independent Kenya, found that Ngei's wife, Emma was getting preferential treatment for her business, Emma Stores (Uhuru Millers of Kangundo) through which she bought maize directly from farmers, which was illegal at the time.
* Between 1986 and 1991 the construction of the [[Turkwel Hydroelectric Power Station]] was riddled with claims of corruption. The dam was eventually built at three times the estimated cost, twice the allocated amount and producing energy significantly below capacity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/resource/turning-blind-eye#index-02-03-01-00&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990‚Äì1999===
* The longest-running scandal is the [[Goldenberg scandal]],&lt;ref name=corpwatch&gt;[http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=9429 Forensic accountants trace Goldenburg transaction] (Corpwatch)&lt;/ref&gt; where the Kenyan government subsidised exports of gold, paying exporters in Kenyan Shillings (Sh) 35% over their foreign currency earnings. In this case, the gold was smuggled from Congo. The Goldenberg scandal cost Kenya the equivalent of more than 10% of the country's annual GDP.
* In 1998, political scientist Mutahi Ngunyi's NGO&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Series for Alternative Research in East Africa (SAREAT) engaged [[John Githongo]] to edit a regional political economy magazine, East African Alternatives.&lt;ref name=githongo&gt;[http://www.eastandard.net/archives/InsidePage.php?id=35621 It‚Äôs high treason for Githongo]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (East African Standard)&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine folded after an audit instigated by the lead donor [[Ford Foundation]] found suspected misappropriation and collusion on the part of Ngunyi, who was executive director of SAREAT and Dr [[Jonathan Moyo]], who was the programme officer at the Ford Foundation in charge of disbursing the resources to the NGO. They have both been sued and the matter is still in court. It is known that the Ford Foundation has accepted Githongo's offer to be a prosecution witness in the case.
* A Sh360 million helicopter servicing contract in South Africa.&lt;ref name=eastandard&gt;[http://www.eastandard.net/archives/InsidePage.php?id=36253 New scandal hangs over Sh2.6b secret Army complex]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (East African Standard)&lt;/ref&gt; Military officers had argued that the contract was too extravagant and servicing the helicopters could be done locally. Kenya Air Force (KAF) went ahead to spend Sh108 million as a down payment for servicing the Puma helicopters, whose tail number is logged as 418 at Denel Aviation, a South African firm.

===2000‚Äì2009===
* In 2003, military was split over plans to buy new Czech fighter jets.&lt;ref name=eastandard/&gt; The plan to buy the jet fighters would have cost taxpayers Sh12.3 billion.
* A Sh4.1 billion Navy ship deal.&lt;ref name=eastandard/&gt; A Navy project was given to Euromarine, a company associated with Anura Pereira, the tender awarded in a process that has been criticised as irregular. The tender was worth Sh4.1 billion. Military analysts say a similar vessel could have been built for Sh1.8 billion.
* [[Chamanlal Kamani]] had been involved in a supply contract, as Kamsons Motors.&lt;ref name=nationaudio&gt;[http://www.nationaudio.com/News/EastAfrican/08102000/Regional/Regional22.html Kenya Graft Watchdog Set to Charge More Suspects]&lt;/ref&gt; Kampsons tendered for the supply of Mahindra Jeeps to the Police Department in the mid 1990s for close to Sh1 million (US$13,000) each, at a time when showrooms would have charged customers a sixth of the price. Moreover, the vehicles were being bought for a government department and were therefore imported duty-free. Few of the more than 1,000 units that were imported over several years are in service today.
* The Kamanis were also involved in a deal to build a [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] forensic laboratory. On 7 June 2004 an amount of $4.7 million was wired back. The payment was a refund against the money paid for the Criminal Investigations Department forensic laboratory.&lt;ref name=nation&gt;[http://www.africafiles.org/article.asp?ID=10731&amp;ThisURL=./kenya.asp&amp;URLName=Kenya When bogus firms wired back Sh1bn] (Daily Nation)&lt;/ref&gt; Another euro 5.2 million was paid back in respect of the E-cop project, which involved computerisation of the police force and the installation of spy cameras in Nairobi by Infotalent Systems Private Limited.&lt;ref name=nation /&gt;
* The Prisons department lost $3 million after contracting Hallmark International, a company associated with [[Deepak Kamani]] of Kamsons Motors, for the supply of 30 boilers.&lt;ref name=nationaudio/&gt; Only half of the boilers were delivered&amp;nbsp;‚Äì from India and not the United States as had been agreed.
* The construction of Nexus, a secret military communication centre in Karen, Nairobi.&lt;ref name=eastandard /&gt; The Government spent Sh2.6 billion (US$36.9 million) to construct the complex. Three years later, military personnel have not moved into the centre. A phantom company, Nedermar BV Technologies, which is said to have its headquarters in the Netherlands, implemented the secret project situated along Karen South Road. Nedermar is linked to businessman Anura Pereira. However, Pereira has denied this. The tendering process for the Nexus project was circumvented as DoD's Departmental Tender Committee. Funding for the project was made through the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The complex is currently headed by Colonel Philip Kameru. Nexus was first meant to be an ammunition dumpsite before it was turned into a military communication and operations centre. Construction continued without any site visits by either the DoD staff or Ministry of Public Works officials. The Nexus project was implemented during the tenure of General Joseph Kibwana.
* In 2005 plans to buy a sophisticated ¬£20 million passport equipment system from France,&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/kenya/story/0,12689,1254928,00.html report on the Anglo Leasing scandal] (Guardian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TI&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases_nc/2006/2006_01_23_kenya_githongo It's time to tell the Kenyan people the truth about the anglo-leasing corruption scandal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215231426/http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases_nc/2006/2006_01_23_kenya_githongo |date=15 February 2006}} (Transparency International)&lt;/ref&gt; as government wanted to replace its passport printing system, created conditions for [[Anglo Leasing Scandal|corruption scandal]]. The transaction was originally quoted at 6 million euros from Fran√ßois Charles Oberthur of Paris (a supplier of Visa and MasterCards) but was awarded to a British firm, the Anglo-Leasing and Finance Company Limited, at 30 million euros, who would have sub-contracted the same French firm to do the work. Despite the lack of competitive tendering Anglo Leasing was paid a "commitment fee" of more than ¬£600,000. Anglo Leasing's agent is a Liverpool-based firm, Saagar Associates, owned by a woman whose family has enjoyed close links with senior officials in the Moi regime. Company records show Saagar Associates is owned by Mrs [[Sudha Ruparell]], a 47-year-old Kenyan woman. Ruparell is the daughter of [[Chamanlal Kamani]], the multimillionaire patriarch of a business family that enjoyed close links with senior officials in the Moi regime. Anglo Leasing made a repayment of euro 956,700 through a telegraphic transfer from Schroeder &amp; Co Bank AG, Switzerland on 17 May 2004.&lt;ref name=nation /&gt;
* The local chapter of [[Transparency International]] and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR), a government body released a report in February 2006, stating that between January 2003 and September 2004, the [[National Rainbow Coalition]] government spent about $12-million on cars that were mostly for the personal use of senior government officials.&lt;ref name=ips&gt;[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=32054 Vehicle Saga Shows Parliament Has Few Budgetary Teeth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207074302/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=32054 |date=7 February 2006}} (Inter Press Service News Agency)&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicles included 57 [[Mercedes-Benz]], as well as [[Toyota Land Cruiser|Land Cruiser]]s, [[Mitsubishi Pajero]]s, [[Range Rover]]s, [[Nissan Terrano]]s and [[Nissan Patrol]]s. The $12-million substantially exceeded what the government spent over the 2003/04 financial year on controlling malaria&amp;nbsp;‚Äì "the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Kenya", says the report.
* In late February 2006, the newspaper ''[[The Standard (Kenya)|The Standard]]'' ran a story claiming that president [[Mwai Kibaki]] and senior opposition figure [[Kalonzo Musyoka]] had been holding secret meetings. On 2 March at 1:00&amp;nbsp;am local time (2200 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on the 1st), masked gunmen carrying [[AK-47]]s raided multiple editorial offices of ''The Standard'', and of its television station [[Kenya Television Network|KTN]]. They kicked and beat staff members, forcibly took computers and transmission equipment, burned all the copies of the 2 March edition of the newspaper, and damaged the [[Printing press|press]]es. At KTN, they shut down the power, putting the station off the air. Initially, the Kenyan information minister claimed no knowledge of the raid, but it has since revealed that Kenyan police were responsible. The Ministry of the Internal Security later stated that the incident was to safeguard state security. "If you rattle a snake you must be prepared to be bitten by it," [[John Michuki]] said. Three journalists at ''The Standard'', arrested after the critical story was printed, are still being held without charge.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC]]: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4765250.stm Kenya admits armed raids on paper]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Reuters]]: [http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/594f371980df55020e96a8268a9aa506.htm Leading media house shut down by armed men]&lt;/ref&gt; The story now also features the bizarre case of two Armenian businessmen, mocked in the press for their taste for heavy gold chains, watches and rings, referred to as [[Mercenaries]], who the opposition says led the raid and had shady dealings with Kibaki's government.&lt;ref&gt;[[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]] [http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=68&amp;art_id=qw1142947800430B251 Kibaki in trouble as parliament re-opens]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revealed: All about Arturs |url=http://www.eastandard.net/archives/InsidePage.php?id=1143975198 |work=[[The Standard (Kenya)|The Standard]] |date=28 September 2007 |accessdate=2008-12-12 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Artur brothers were drug traffickers who enjoyed state security: Report |url=http://www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/nmgcontententry.asp?category_id=1&amp;newsid=107377|work=[[Daily Nation (Kenya)|Daily Nation]] |date=28 September 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119215417/http://www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/nmgcontententry.asp?category_id=1&amp;newsid=107377 |archivedate=19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2006, the government was accused of failing to act on a banking fraud scam worth $1.5bn involving [[money laundering]] and [[tax evasion]], reported by whistle-blowers as early as 2004. Investigators believe sums worth 10% of Kenya's national income are involved. A recent auditor's report says the scale of the operations "threatens the stability of the Kenyan economy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/africa/6123832.stm Bank scam threatens Kenya economy] [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2006, British Foreign Office minister [[Kim Howells]] warned, that corruption in Kenya is increasing the UK's exposure to drug trafficking and terrorism. "People can be bought, right from the person who works at the docks in Mombasa up to the government. (...) This weakness has been recognised by drug-traffickers and probably by terrorists too." Said Howells for the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6135244.stm Kenya corruption 'threatening UK'] [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 31 August 2007, ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper featured on its front page a story about more than [[Pound sterling|GBP]] 1 billion transferred out of Kenya by the family and associates of former Kenyan leader Daniel arap Moi. The Guardian sourced the information from the [[WikiLeaks]] article ''The looting of Kenya under President Moi'' and its analysis of a leaked investigative document ("the [[Kroll Inc.|Kroll]] report") prepared for the [[Mwai Kibaki|Kibaki]] government in 2004 to try to recover money stolen during Moi's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/31/kenya.topstories3 |title=The looting of Kenya |date=31 August 2007 |author=Xan Rice |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 2007-09-06 parliament passed the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, restricting investigations by the [[Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission]] to offences committed prior to May 2003, excluding the Goldenberg and Anglo-Leasing scandals and other major cases. The move was condemned by anti-corruption campaigners; [[Mwalimu Mati]], former chief executive of the [[Transparency International]] Kenya Chapter, declared that "grand corruption has swallowed the government and parliament that Kenyans elected to fight it in 2002".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Uproar over move on economic crimes |url=http://www.eastandard.net/archives/InsidePage.php?id=1143974522 |work=[[The Standard (Kenya)|The Standard]] |date=12 December 2008 |accessdate=2007-09-14 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to public outrage generated by the move, President Kibaki announced that he would veto the bill.
* In September 2007, [[WikiLeaks]] released documents exposing a 500 million Kenyan shilling payroll fraud at Egerton University] and subsequent cover up, now the subject of ongoing legal dispute in the High Court.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}
* On 28 September 2007, [[WikiLeaks]] released 28 investigative documents] exposing a US$1.5 billion money laundering fraud by [[Charter House Bank Ltd]]. Re-reported in the Kenyan Standard newspaper.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}
* In June 2008, the [[Grand Regency Scandal]] broke, wherein the Central Bank of Kenya is alleged to have secretly sold a luxury hotel in Nairobi to an unidentified group of Libyan investors for more than 4 billion Kenyan Shillings (approx US $60 million) below the appraised market value. Finance Minister [[Amos Kimunya]] negotiated the sale, and was censured in a near-unanimous motion by the Kenyan Parliament, though he vehemently denies the charges. This follows on the heels of the [[Safaricom IPO]], overseen by Kimunya, which has been alternatively praised and questioned for possible corruption in the execution of the sale. [[Safaricom]] is the largest mobile phone service provider in Kenya, having operated with a near-government monopoly for many years. The government of Kenya sold its 50% stake in Safaricom in the IPO.
* In January 2009, a scandal became public over the [[2009 Kenyan Maize Scandal|sale of imported maize]].
* The [[2009 Triton Oil Scandal]] regarding the unauthorised releasing of oil by [[Kenya Pipeline Company]] (KPC) without informing financiers became public in January 2009.

===2010‚Äìpresent===
* In October 2012, allegations surfaced that top Foreign Affairs ministry officials ignored land offered by Japan that could have saved the country loss of Sh1.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nation.co.ke/News/Shame%20of%20graft%20that%20is%20the%20Tokyo%20embassy%20report%20/-/1056/1033292/-/10xk82kz/-/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal led to the resignation of the then Foreign Affairs Minister [[Moses Wetangula]].
* In October 2010, the Department of Defence uncovered a bribery scandal involving senior Kenya Defence Force Officers in the corrupt Sh1.6 billion purchase of armoured personnel carriers from South African company OTT Technologies (Pty) Ltd. Minister of Defence Yusuf Haji retired several high-ranking officers in January 2011 &lt;ref name=standardmedia&gt;[https://archive.is/20120910153835/http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/InsidePage.php?id=2000020947&amp;catid=4&amp;a=1 25 October 2010: DoD Uncovers Tender Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt; accused of taking bribes by OTT Technologies (Pty) Ltd, and the matter was referred for further investigation to Parliament.&lt;ref name=nairobistar&gt;[https://archive.is/20131009065158/http://www.nairobistar.com/national/national/11250-mps-grill-haji-over-military-hardware-deals- 19 January 2011: Min/Def retires KDF officers Involved in APC Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt; The September 2012 Report on Military Modernization Programmes by the Departmental Committee on Defence and Foreign Relations found that the irregular procurement of the [[PUMA M26-15|PUMA M26]] armoured carriers had violated multiple sections of the Public Procurement Act 2005, that OTT Technologies (Pty) Ltd's business partners in Kenya had been identified by the US Government as being involved in international crime and drugs smuggling, and recommended that OTT Technologies (Pty) Ltd be barred from doing any business with the Government of Kenya in the future.&lt;ref name=nairobistar.com&gt;[https://archive.is/20131009065151/http://www.nairobistar.com/national/national/21417-military-mps-probe-purchase-of-military-carriers 19 April 2011: Launch of Parliamentary Committee to investigate APC Bribery]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the same company was accused by the government of Mozambique of irregular tax and export control activities in the transport of similar armoured carriers through Mozambique for onward trafficking into Africa.&lt;ref name=verfade.co.mz&gt;[http://www.verdade.co.mz/destaques/democracia/45012-empresa-que-monta-veiculos-blindados-em-mocambique-e-ilegalq Company that Mounted Armored Vehicles to the United Nations Operates Illegally in Mozambique (Portuguese)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dollar voting''' is an analogy that has been used to refer to the impact of consumer choice on producers' actions through the flow of consumer payments to producers for their goods and services.

==Overview==
In some Principles of Economics textbooks of the mid-20th Century, the term was used to describe the process by which consumers' choices influence firms' production decisions.  Products that consumers buy will tend to be produced in the future. Products that do not sell as well as expected will receive fewer productive resources in the future. Effectively, according to this analogy, consumers are voting for "winners" and "losers" with their purchases. This argument was used to explain and justify market allocations of goods and services under the catchphrase "consumer sovereignty".

Consumer boycotts have from time to time been proposed as a useful approach to change producers' behavior. The goals of selective boycotts, or dollar voting, have been diverse, and have included a desire to see decreased corporate revenues, removal of key executives, or reputational damage.&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey, Neale. "Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is. Vote With Your Dollars." The Huffington Post. February 20, 2017. Accessed June 10, 2018. https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is-vote-with-your_us_58a92d46e4b0fa149f9ac73c.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern idea of dollar voting can be traced back to its development by James Buchanan in ''Individual Choice in Voting and the Market''. As a public choice theorist, Buchanan equated economic participation by the individual as a form of pure democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, James M. "Individual Choice in Voting and the Market." Journal of Political Economy 62, no. 4 (1954): 334-43. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1827235.&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as political consumerism, dollar voting‚Äôs history in the United States can be followed back to the American Revolution, when colonists boycotted several British products in protest of taxation without representation.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Benjamin J., and Brandon L. Bartels. "Politics at the Checkout Line: Explaining Political Consumerism in the United States." Political Research Quarterly 64, no. 4 (2011): 803-17. https://www.jstor.org/stable/23056348.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dollar voting has been increasingly thought to be a useful tool in changing producers' behavior. If voters feel disenfranchised politically, they may turn to using their spending power to influence politics and the economy. Consumers aiming to use dollar voting ultimately hope to impact society‚Äôs values and use of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Benjamin J., and Brandon L. Bartels. "Politics at the Checkout Line: Explaining Political Consumerism in the United States." Political Research Quarterly 64, no. 4 (2011): 803-17. https://www.jstor.org/stable/23056348.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
The idea of dollar voting has faced criticism for its class implications. In modern America, dollar voting is often seen being used by middle and upper middle class consumers who spend their money at local farmers markets, community agricultural programs, and the preparation of ‚Äúslow food‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;Haydu, Jeffrey. "Consumer Citizenship and Cross-Class Activism: The Case of the National Consumers' League, 1899-1918." Sociological Forum 29, no. 3 (2014): 628-49. https://www.jstor.org/stable/43653954.&lt;/ref&gt; These purchases do not affect low-income producers and consumer in the food market.&lt;ref&gt;Haydu, Jeffrey. "Consumer Citizenship and Cross-Class Activism: The Case of the National Consumers' League, 1899-1918." Sociological Forum 29, no. 3 (2014): 628-49. https://www.jstor.org/stable/43653954.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, dollar voting has been criticized as a form of conspicuous consumption for the well-off, serving more as a display of morality than of actual consumer preference.&lt;ref&gt;Haydu, Jeffrey. "Consumer Citizenship and Cross-Class Activism: The Case of the National Consumers' League, 1899-1918." Sociological Forum 29, no. 3 (2014): 628-49. https://www.jstor.org/stable/43653954.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dollar voting has also been criticized for being a sort of consumer vigilantism, as while most economists and economic philosophers accept that consumers have a right to their personal moral choices in the market, large-scale movements to influence consumer spending could have potentially dangerous implications.&lt;ref&gt;HUSSAIN, WAHEED. "Is Ethical Consumerism an Impermissible Form of Vigilantism?" Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs 40, no. 2 (2012): 111-43. https://www.jstor.org/stable/23261269.&lt;/ref&gt;

As more consumer activists find ways to use the power of their dollar, efforts at encouraging corporations and firms to act in environmentally friendly ways have become popular. However, it is unclear whether or not a firm that creates negative environmental externalities will legitimately change its method of production to satisfy such desires.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Jos√©e.

Theory and Society 37, no. 3 (2008): 229-70. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40211036.&lt;/ref&gt; It also has the potential to move citizens away from law making efforts that check unmitigated self interest in both firms and consumers, and instead shifts this responsibility almost completely over to the market.

'''Don't Just Vote, Get Active''', also known as '''Don't Just (Not) Vote'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=Winter 2006 |title=The Fate of the Black Pearl |journal=[[Rolling Thunder (zine)|Rolling Thunder]] |issue=2 |pages=24‚Äì27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''DJV''') was an [[Openness|open]], [[decentralized]] national campaign in the [[United States of America]] initiated by the [[CrimethInc.|CrimethInc. Ex-Workers Collective]] and its allies.&lt;ref name="rev"&gt;{{cite book |last=Andersen |first=Mark |title=All the Power : Revolution Without Illusion |publisher=Punk Planet Books |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-888451-72-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DJV was publicly announced at the [[NCOR|National Conference on Organized Resistance]] (NCOR) in 2004 and was an activist-orientated propaganda initiative focused on demonstrating the effectiveness of [[direct democracy]] and [[direct action]] over [[Representation (politics)|political representation]].&lt;ref name="dubvo"&gt;{{cite journal|date=Spring 2005 |title=The Secret World of Duvbo |journal=[[Green Anarchy]] |issue=19 |url=http://www.greenanarchy.org/index.php?action=viewwritingdetail&amp;writingId=163 |accessdate=2008-01-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110060003/http://www.greenanarchy.org/index.php?action=viewwritingdetail&amp;writingId=163 |archivedate=2007-11-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was interpreted by some as a [[counterpoint]] to Punkvoter and other anti-[[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2004|Bush]] voter participation efforts.&lt;ref name="rev"/&gt; However, organizers initially conceived of the campaign without knowledge of the Punkvoter campaign.

== Overview ==
According to one of the 20,000 voter's guides distributed by those involved with the campaign before the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], "Voting for people to represent your interests is the least efficient and effective means of applying political power. The alternative, broadly speaking, is acting directly to represent your interests yourself." Unlike previous projects critical of [[electoral system|electoral politics]], DJV deliberately avoided the voting vs. abstention argument that is common in the [[anarchist]] milieu.

The campaign was characterised by ''[[The American Prospect]]'' as "a clear inheritor of the spirit of [[May 1968 in France|1968]]", citing its willingness to celebrate in the street, regardless of the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mattson |first=Kevin |date=March 2005 |title=Goodbye to All That |journal=[[American Prospect]] |url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=9389 |accessdate=2008-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127232809/http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=9389 |archivedate=2008-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the election's aftermath, Don't Just Vote, Get Active endorsed the Anarchist Resistance "call to action" against the [[United States presidential inaugurations|2005 presidential inauguration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anarchistresistance.org/archive/j20-anarchistcall.shtml |title=Inauguration 2005: Anarchist Resistance Call to Action |accessdate=2008-01-13 |work=Anarchist Resistance |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120211027/http://www.anarchistresistance.org/archive/j20-anarchistcall.shtml |archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The campaign was criticised in ''[[Green Anarchy]]'' for its credulous if qualified endorsement of voting, accusing [[CrimethInc.]] of offering "a soothing middle ground" instead of outright rejecting [[Statism|statist]] mechanisms of control.&lt;ref name="greenarchy"&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=CrimethInc. |vauthors= |date=Fall‚ÄìWinter 2004 |title=Don't Just Vote-Get Active: A Community Non-Partisan Voters' Guide 2004 |journal=[[Green Anarchy]] |issue=18 |url=http://www.greenanarchy.org/index.php?action=viewwritingdetail&amp;writingId=342 |accessdate=2008-01-13 |quote= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111064112/http://www.greenanarchy.org/index.php?action=viewwritingdetail&amp;writingId=342 |archivedate=2007-11-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a reworking of the campaign's slogan, the magazine exhorted readers "don't JUST be active, WAKE THE FUCK UP!"&lt;ref name="greenarchy"/&gt; [[Mark Andersen]], in ''All the Power: Revolution without Illusion'' praised the initially empowering message of the campaign but criticised it for "a slide toward insular subcultural politics", drawing note to the recurrent phrases "[[tyranny of the majority]]", "living without permission" and "autonomy" which he claimed evinced an "esoteric, self-referential approach" which would turn acolytes into "radical [[navel-gazing|navel-gazers]]".&lt;ref name="rev"/&gt;

'''Employee Monitoring''' is the act of employers [[surveillance|surveying]] [[employee]] activity through different surveillance methods. Organizations engage in employee monitoring for different reasons such as to track [[Performance management|performance]], to avoid legal liability, to protect [[trade secrets]], and to address other security concerns. This practice may impact [[Job satisfaction|employee satisfaction]] due to its impact on the [[privacy|privacy of the employees]]. Among organizations, the extent and methods of employee monitoring differ.[1]

== Surveillance Methods ==

Due to the use of company computers, telephones, workspaces, and software, employers can have access to the daily activities of their employees. These devices are used to monitor the organizations' employees. Common methods of monitoring include software monitoring, telephone tapping, video surveillance, email monitoring, and location monitoring.

'''Software monitoring''' can occur if employees use company computers for their work, companies often utilize employee monitoring software that allows them to track what their employees are doing on the computers. Such as, what the speed of typing is, what mistakes are made, what applications were used, and what specific keys were pressed.

{{Main articles|Employee monitoring software}}

'''Telephone tapping''' can be used to recover employees' phone call details and conversations. These can be recorded during monitoring. The number of calls, the duration of each call, and the idle time between calls, can all go into an automatic log for analysis by the company.&lt;ref&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/231233456&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main articles|Telephone tapping}}

'''Video surveillance''' can provide video feed of employee activities that are passed through to a central location where they are monitored live by another person. These can be recorded and stored for future reference which some believe is the most accurate way to monitor employees. "This is a benefit because it provides an unbiased method of performance evaluation and prevents the interference of a manager's feelings in an employee's review (Mishra and Crampton, 1998)." Management can review the performance of an employee by checking the surveillance to detect and potentially prevent problems.[1]

{{Main articles|Video Surveillance}}

'''Email monitoring''' gives employers the ability to look at email messages sent or received by their employees. Emails can be viewed and recovered even if they had been previously deleted. In the United States, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act provides some privacy protections regarding monitoring of employees' email messages and other electronic communications. See Electronic Communications Privacy Act ¬ß Employee Privacy.

{{Main articles|Email Surveillance}}

'''Location monitoring''' can occur and be used for employees that do not work in a static location. Supervisors may choose to track their location. Common examples of companies that use location monitoring are delivery and transportation industries. In some of these cases, the employee monitoring is incidental as the location is tracked for other purposes, that can help improve customer satisfaction. Employees' phone call details and conversations can be recorded during monitoring. The number of calls, the duration of each call, and the idle time between calls, can all go into an automatic log for analysis by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SHERMAN |first=MARK |title=GOV'T OBTAINS WIDE AP PHONE RECORDS IN PROBE |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/govt-obtains-wide-ap-phone-records-probe |accessdate=May 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514001309/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/govt-obtains-wide-ap-phone-records-probe |archivedate=May 14, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Key logging''', or keystroke logging, is a process that records the keys a user is typing on the keyboard in order. These programs can also capture screenshots when triggered by predefined keywords. Some see it as violating workplace privacy and it's also notorious for being used with malicious intent. Loggers collect and store passwords, bank account information, private messages, credit card numbers, PIN numbers, and usernames. 
{{main article|Keystroke logging}}

==Legality==
Employee monitoring often is in conflict with [[workplace privacy|employees' privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mishra, J. M. |author2= Crampton, S. M. |last-author-amp=yes |year=1998|title=Employee monitoring: Privacy in the workplace?|journal=SAM Advanced Management Journal (07497075)|volume=63 |issue=3 |page=4|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-21160636.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monitoring often collects work-related activities, but it can also collect employee's personal information that is not linked to their work. Monitoring in the workplace may put employers and employees at odds because both sides are trying to protect personal interests. Employees want to maintain their privacy while employers want to ensure company resources aren't misused. In any case, companies can maintain ethical monitoring policies by avoiding indiscriminate monitoring of employees' activities.&lt;ref&gt; Burks, F. ''Ethical Issues &amp; Employer Monitoring Internet Usage''. Chron.com, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The employee needs to understand what is expected of them while the employer needs to establish that rule.

With employee monitoring, there are many guidelines that one must follow and put in place to protect the company and the individual. Some following cases are ones that have shaped the certain rules and regulations that are in effect today. For instance, in Canada, it is illegal to perform invasive monitoring, such as reading an employee's emails, unless it can be shown that it is a necessary precaution and there are no other alternatives. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/supreme-court-rules-employees-have-right-to-privacy-on-work-computers/article4625660/&lt;/ref&gt; In Maryland, everyone in the conversation must give consent before the conversation can be recorded. The state of California requires that the monitored conversations have a beep at certain intervals or there must be a message informing the caller that the conversations may be recorded. However, this does not inform the company representative which calls are being recorded. Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Colorado and New Jersey have laws relating to when a conversation can be recorded. "Lawyers generally advise that one way for businesses to avoid liability for monitoring employees‚Äô online activities is to take all necessary steps to eliminate any reasonable expectation of privacy that employees may have concerning their use of company email and other communications systems." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiakm.org/ojakm/articles/2013/volume1_2/OJAKM_Volume1_2pp44-55.pdf], Yerby, Johnathan. "Legal and Ethical Issues of Employee Monitoring." ''Online Journal of Applied Knowledge Management''. &lt;/ref&gt; Businesses makes employee monitoring a known tool that supervisors use to avoid any potential legal issues that may arise. They will announce this during new hire orientation, in a staff meeting, or even in a workplace contract that employees sign either at the time of hire or after a form of misconduct.

==Legal Uses==

Businesses use employee monitoring for various reasons. The follow is a list that includes, but is not limited to:

* Find needed business information when the employee is not available.
* Protect [[data security|security]] of proprietary information and data.
* Prevent or investigate possible criminal activities by employees.
* Prevent personal use of employer facilities.
* Check for violations of company policy against sending an offensive or pornographic email.
* Investigate complaints of [[workplace harassment|harassment]].
* Check for illegal software.

According to Computer Monitoring: The Hidden War Of Control,"The employer of today has the ability and legal right to read e-mail, review files stored on a company computer, examine computer usage, and track individual employee computer activities. The idea of anonymous actions is an illusion. Every action between a network and the computers connected to it can be tracked. Every action by an individual worker on a computer can be tracked, analyzed and used against the employee. The protections and freedoms guaranteed by the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] are there to protect the individual from the Government and do not generally apply to the normal employee/employer relationship."&lt;ref&gt;Kevin, P. P., &amp; Tammy, Y. A. (2011). Computer monitoring: The hidden war of control. International Journal of Management and Information Systems, 15(1), 49-58. Retrieved from http://journals.cluteonline.com/index.php/IJMIS/article/view/1595&lt;/ref&gt; To benefit the business, employers have the ability to monitor employees whenever they feel is necessary.

==Legal Issues==
In January 2016, European Court of Human Rights issued a landmark ruling in the case of BƒÉrbulescu v Romania (61496/08) regarding monitoring of employees‚Äô computers. The employee Mr. BƒÉrbulescu accused the employer of violating his rights to ‚Äòprivate life‚Äô and ‚Äòcorrespondence‚Äô set in the Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{"itemid":["001-159906"]}/|author=EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, JUDGMENT |title= CASE OF BƒÇRBULESCU v. ROMANIA (Application no. 61496/08) |date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
But the Court stated that the employer had every right to monitor the employee‚Äôs computer in this case due to the fact that such monitoring was implemented to ensure that there is no breach of company policy. This historic ruling has confirmed that it is not unreasonable for employers to monitor their employees‚Äô computer activity and such monitoring does not violate their human rights.

A year later, in July 2017, German court also ruled that computer monitoring of employees is reasonable but the use of keylogging software is excessive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/companies-cant-use-keyloggers-to-spy-on-employees-says-german-court/|author=Catalin Cimpanu|title= Companies Can't Use Keyloggers to Spy on Employees, Says German Court |date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Employee monitoring software developers warn that in each case it is still recommended to advise a legal representative and the employees should give a written agreement with such monitoring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://clevercontrol.com/companies-monitor-employees/#Problems_with_Law |title= How Companies Monitor Their Employees |date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Majority of instances are a case by case situation and is hard to treat all the issues and problems as one. With the ever growing laws, employers shape their guidelines around the new rules and regulations that are formed in court cases.

==Financial benefits==
Employee Monitoring can be used to monitor the safety and productivity of the employees but it also may help businesses financially. From the dishonest unethical employee who steals time and money from the business to the redefining of unprofitable processes in monitoring employee actions, employee monitoring allows for the growth of financial profits from a small investment. The monitoring of employees can help in the protection of employees and it can help as protection in litigation by employees for job-related issues such as failing to perform, illegal activities and harassment claims. According to the American Management Association, almost half (48%) of the companies surveyed use video monitoring to counter theft, violence, and sabotage. Only 7% use video surveillance to track employees' on-the-job performance. Most employers notify employees of anti-theft video surveillance (78%) and performance-related video monitoring (89%), (Retrieved from the article The Latest on Workplace Monitoring and Surveillance on humanresources.about.com)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Training Solutions for Individuals, Organizations and Government Agencies |url=http://humanresources.about.com/gi/o.htm?zi=1/XJ&amp;zTi=1&amp;sdn=humanresources&amp;cdn=money&amp;tm=27&amp;f=00&amp;su=p284.13.342.ip_p554.23.342.ip_&amp;tt=2&amp;bt=4&amp;bts=4&amp;zu=http%3A//www.amanet.org/ }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in ''Labour Economics'', it has been argued that forbidding employers to track employees' on-the-job performance can make economic sense according to efficiency wage theory, while surveillance to prevent illegal activities should be allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Workplace surveillance, privacy protection, and efficiency wages|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537104000764|journal = Labour Economics|date = 2005|pages = 727‚Äì738|volume = 12|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.labeco.2004.06.001|first = Patrick W.|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An indirect way that companies can be affected financially through employee monitoring is that they can be sure they are billing clients correctly. According to "Business 2 Community", inaccurately billing clients is very possible because of the human error. These inaccuracies can cause a dispute between a company and a client which could eventually lead to the client terminating its business with the company. This sort of termination will not only hurt the company's revenue stream but also its reputation with other clients or potential clients. The suggested solution to this problem is a time tracking software to correctly monitor the number of hours a client spends with an employee. &lt;ref&gt; {https://www.business2community.com/human-resources/6-benefits-of-employee-monitoring-0134730}, Vessella, Victoria. "6 Benefits of Employee Monitoring." ''Business 2 Community''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnathan Yerby said, "The enormity of potential productivity loses, as reported by Court (2004), is approximately one million dollars
annually for a company with 500 employees surfing the Internet for just a half hour a day." &lt;ref&gt;{http://www.iiakm.org/ojakm/articles/2013/volume1_2/OJAKM_Volume1_2pp44-55.pdf], Yerby, Johnathan. "Legal and Ethical Issues of Employee Monitoring." ''Online Journal of Applied Knowledge Management''.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does employee monitoring prevent theft of money and resources, but it also prevents theft of time and to make sure people are doing what they are supposed to be doing in the workplace. This is used a lot during the Holidays with online shopping, as well as during [[March Madness]]. Employees will spend their time using their work time for personal uses and employee monitoring helps regulate this.

'''Fedayeen''' ({{lang-ar|ŸÅŸêÿØÿßÿ¶ŸäŸëŸäŸÜ}} ''fidƒÅ ºƒ´yƒ´n''; {{IPA-ar|f…™daÀê î…™jiÀên}}){{ref|A|[note A]}}&lt;ref name=Rea&gt;{{cite book|title=''The Arab-Israeli Conflict''|author=Tony Rea and John Wright|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1993|page=43|isbn=0-19-917170-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term used to refer to various military groups willing to sacrifice themselves.

==Etymology==
The term ''fedayi'' is derived from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|&lt;big&gt;ŸÅÿØÿßÿ¶ŸäŸàŸÜ&lt;/big&gt;}} ''fidƒÅ'ƒ´y≈´n'' {{IPA-ar|f…™daÀê î…™juÀên|IPA}}, literally meaning: "those who sacrifice themselves".&lt;ref name=Rea/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theisraelproject.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=hsJPK0PIJpH&amp;b=886017&amp;ct=1181593 Middle East Glossary - The Israel Project: FEDAYEE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427125233/http://www.theisraelproject.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=hsJPK0PIJpH&amp;b=886017&amp;ct=1181593 |date=2012-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nizari Ismaili state==
{{main article|Hashshashins}}
[[Hassan-i-Sabbah]], who founded the [[Nizari Ismaili state]] in Persia and Syria, first coined the term to refer to the [[Hashshashins]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} ''fidƒÅ ºƒ´yƒ´n'' is the plural of ''fidƒÅ ºƒ´'', which means "sacrifice."  It is widely understood as "those willing to sacrifice themselves for God".  The group carried out an armed struggle against enslavement.

==Egypt==
During the 1940s, a group of civilians volunteered to fight the [[United Kingdom|British]] control of [[Egypt]]ian land around the [[Suez Canal]]. The British had deployed military bases along the coast of the Suez Canal under the claim of protection. Many Egyptians viewed this as an invasion against their [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] power over their country. While the Egyptian government didn't refuse the action, the people's leaders organized groups of Fedayeen who were trained to combat and kill British soldiers everywhere in Egypt, including the military bases. Those groups were viewed very highly among the Egyptian population. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In 1951 "mobs of "irregular self-sacrificers, or fedayeen"  some "armed by the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]", attacked the British military base defending the Suez Canal Zone.&lt;ref name="WawroFedayeen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wawro|first1=Geoffrey|title=Quicksand: America's Pursuit of Power in the Middle East|date=2010|publisher=Penguin|isbn=1101197684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eritrea==
Known by the same name, they operated inside the capital city, [[Asmara]], during the last 15‚Äì20 years of the armed struggle in [[Eritrea]] against [[Ethiopia]]. They operated secretly and eliminated people who were considered dangerous to the [[Eritrean War of Independence|struggle to free Eritrea]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}{{when|date=May 2016}}.

==Iran==
Two very different groups used the name Fedayeen in recent [[Iran]]ian history. [[Fadayan-e Islam]] has been described as "one of the first real [[Islamic fundamentalist]] organizations in the [[Muslim world]]". It was founded by [[Navab Safavi]] in 1946 for the purpose of demanding strict application of the sharia and assassinating those it believed to be [[Apostasy in Islam|apostates]] and enemies of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand, ''A Modern History Of Iran'', Cambridge University Press, 2008, p.116&lt;/ref&gt; After several successful assassinations it was suppressed in 1956 and several leading members were executed.

A [[Marxism|Marxist]]-leaning activist group known as the Fedayeen (Feday√¢n in Persian language) was founded in 1971 and based in [[Tehran]]. Operating between 1971 and 1983, the Fedayeen carried out a number of political assassinations in the course of the struggle against the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]], after which the group was suppressed.

In 1979 the [[Iranian People's Fed√¢i Guerrillas]] split from the [[Organization of Iranian People's Fedaian (Majority)]].

==Iraq==
Beginning in 1995, [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] established a [[paramilitary]] group known as the [[Fedayeen Saddam]], loyal to the then president [[Saddam Hussein]] and the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party ‚Äì Iraq Region|Ba'athist]] government. The name was chosen to imply a connection with the Palestinian Fedayeen. In July 2003, personnel records for the Fedayeen organization in Iraq were discovered in the basement of the former Fedayeen headquarters in east [[Baghdad]] near the [[Rasheed Air Base]]. At the time of the discovery, an Iraqi political party occupied the building; after an extensive cataloging process, an operation was conducted in Baghdad resulting in several individuals being detained.

During this time (1948 ‚Äì c. 1980), the word entered international usage and was frequently used in the Arab media as a synonym for great militancy.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In the Israeli Hebrew press of this time the term ({{Hebrew|◊§÷∑◊ì÷∑◊ê◊ô◊ï÷º◊ü}} ''fada'iun'') had highly negative connotations and was associated with [[terrorism]].&lt;ref name=MFA0/&gt; Since the mid-1960s and the rise of more organized and specific militant groups, such as the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], the word has fallen out of usage, but not in the historical context.

==Turkey/Late Ottoman Empire==
Within the context of [[History of Turkey|Turkish history]], the term ''fedailer'' is often associated with the [[Decline and modernization of the Ottoman Empire|Late Ottoman]] or [[One-party period of the Republic of Turkey|Early Republican]] irregular forces, known as: [[Kuva-yi Milliye]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yumuktepe.com/kurtulus-savasinda-icel-dort-ve-besinci-bolum/ KURTULU≈û SAVA≈ûINDA ƒ∞√áEL ‚Äì D√ñRT VE BE≈ûƒ∞NCƒ∞ B√ñL√úM&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}{{note|A|note A}}Derives from the word {{lang|ar|ŸÅÿØÿßÿ°}} ''fidƒÅ º'', which means [[wikt:redemption|redemption]]. Literally, someone who redeems himself by risking or sacrificing his life. The pronunciation varies for the first vowel, for example {{IPA-arz|feÀàd√¶Àê î, feÀàd√¶Àê îi|IPA}}, hence the transcription difference.{{refend}}

'''GOSCON''' (Government Open Source Conference) was a conference held annually from 2005 to 2011 to explore the use of [[open standard]] and [[open-source software]] in the public sector, mostly in the [[United states]].

GOSCON was conceived of at [[Oregon State University]]'s [[OSU Open Source Lab|Open Source Lab]], and first held in 2005. Deborah Bryant was the founder and director of the conference. From 2005 to 2008, GOSCON was held in [[Portland, Oregon]]. In 2009, it was held in [[Washington, D.C.]] at the [[Ronald Reagan Building]]. In 2010 it was held in Portland, and in 2011 it was again held in Washington, D.C., though it was cancelled early due to a nearby [[earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://debbryant.com/2011/09/13/goscon-2011-shakes-up-government-it/ GOSCON 2011 SHAKES UP GOVERNMENT IT], Deborah Bryant, September 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In GOSCON, academic and government IT managers from the local, state and national level discuss opportunities and challenges presented by the use of open-source software ‚Äî some of which are specific to public sector situations (such as the government procurement process) and some of which are shared by many IT departments (such as questions about the ongoing support of Open Source Software projects). Speakers have included open-source software project leaders such as [[Brian Behlendorf]], [[Larry Augustin]] and [[Ward Cunningham]]; government and university IT managers; academic researchers and corporate executives.

Past sessions have covered:

* The ROI of Open Source Software in government settings (2005)
* The "[[Community source]]" model (2005)
* Best Open Source Software practices for state and local government agencies (2005)
* The impact of Open ICT infrastructure on economic development (2005)
* Open Source Software and public procurement policies (2006)
* Forming collaborations between government agencies (2006)
* The global view of Open Source Software and its use in governments (2006)
* Specific application topics including transportation, corrections, health &amp; human services, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16855">'''General practice''' is the name given in the United Kingdom to the service provided by [[General practitioner]]s. In other countries similar services may be described as [[family medicine]] or [[primary care]]. The term Primary Care in the UK may also include services provided by community pharmacy, [[optometry|optometrist]], dental surgery and community hearing care providers.  The balance of care between primary care and secondary care - which usually refers to hospital based services - varies from place to place, and with time.  In many countries there are initiatives to move services out of hospitals into the community, in the expectation that this will save money and be more convenient.

==India==

A group of 15 doctors based in Birmingham have set up a [[social enterprise]] company - Pathfinder Healthcare - which plans to build eight primary health centres in India on the British model of general practice.  According to Dr Niti Pall, primary health care is very poorly developed in India. These centres will be run commercially. Patients will be charged 200 to 300 Rupees for an initial consultation, and prescribed only [[generic drug]]s, dispensed from attached pharmacies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GPs export NHS model of general practice to India|url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/gps-export-nhs-model-of-general-practice-to-india/13251583.article|accessdate=6 July 2017|publisher=Pulse|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
In Ireland there are about 2,500 General Practitioners working in group practices, primary care centres, single practices and health centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Practitioners or Family Doctors|url=http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/gp/|website=Health Service Executive|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
The pattern of services in the UK was largely established by the [[National Insurance Act 1911]]  which established the list system which came from the [[friendly society|friendly societies]] across the country.  Every patient was entitled to be on the list, or panel of a general practitioner.  In 1911 that only applied to those who paid [[National insurance contribution]]s. In 1938 43% of the adult population was covered by a panel doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Timmins|first1=Nicholas|title=The five giants|date=1995|publisher=Fontana|isbn=0006863183|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the National Health Service was established in 1948 this extended to the whole population.  The practice would be responsible for the patient record which was kept in a "'''Lloyd George envelope'''"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ganfyd.org/index.php?title=Lloyd_George_Envelope&lt;/ref&gt; and would be transferred if necessary to another practice if the patient changed practice.  In the UK, unlike many other countries, patients do not normally have direct access to hospital consultants and the GP controls access to secondary care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Royal Commission on the NHS Chapter 7|date=July 1979|publisher=HMSO|isbn=0101761503|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-7/|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Practices were generally small, often single handed, operating from the doctor's home and often with the doctor's wife acting as a receptionist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The evolving role and nature of general practice in England|url=https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/files/kf/field/field_related_document/gp-inquiry-report-evolving-role-nature-2mar11.pdf|accessdate=6 July 2017|publisher=Kings Fund|date=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:GP records in envelopes.jpg|thumb|Lloyd George envelopes at [[Whalsay]] Health Centre 2012]]

In 1953, general practitioners were estimated to be making between 12 and 30 home visits each day and seeing between 15 and 50 patients in their surgeries.&lt;ref name="A century of general practice"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kmietowicz,|first1=Zosia|title=A century of general practice|pmc=1325136|publisher=British Medical Journal|date=7 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Services are provided under the [[General medical services|General Medical Services Contract]], which is regularly revised.

===England===
The GP Forward View, published by [[NHS England]] in 2016 promised ¬£2.4 billion (14%) real-terms increase in the budget for general practice.  [[Jeremy Hunt]] pledged to increase the number of doctors working in general practice by 5,000. There are 3,250 trainee places available in 2017.  The GP Career Plus scheme is intended to retain GPs aged over 55 in the profession by providing flexible roles such as providing cover, carrying out specific work such as managing long-term conditions, or doing home visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jeremy Hunt: The NHS is turning a corner - and I want GPs at the heart of it|url=http://www.gponline.com/jeremy-hunt-nhs-turning-corner-i-want-gps-heart/article/1437052|accessdate=16 July 2017|publisher=GP Online|date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July [[Simon Stevens (NHS England)|Simon Stevens]] announced a programme designed to recruit around 2,000 GPs from the EU and possibly New Zealand and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS to recruit 2,000 GPs from abroad|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/primary-care/exclusive-nhs-to-recruit-2000-gps-from-abroad/7020094.article?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTW1GbE5HRXpaakZsTnpnMCIsInQiOiJUWlJ0Z2MrTjdSRFRsak9aWWY5VzVSc2Z1bHhiUXZjdDB5cWxwNEgxTWs3R2RQU0F1akxJWWFPSlFpQkR2cGF4SzZUamtmZ25jVjhoa1hiMWhIVGYrSUxrTlBETU5wZG56OE14b3BjOHdGdDZkekhLUWtacGxHZ1dOU00zYzZEWSJ9|accessdate=17 July 2017|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[NHS Improvement]] a 1% deterioration in access to general practice can produce a 10% deterioration in emergency department figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=10 ways a vanguard improved care|url=http://healthcareleadernews.com/article/10-ways-vanguard-improved-care|accessdate=23 August 2017|publisher=Healthcare Leader|date=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GPs are increasingly employing [[pharmacist]]s to manage the increasingly complex medication regimes of an aging population. In 2017 more than 1,061 practices were employing pharmacists, following the rollout of [[NHS England]]‚Äôs Clinical Pharmacists in General Practice programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revealed: Next 67 areas recruiting 'clinical pharmacists'|url=https://www.chemistanddruggist.co.uk/news/next-67-areas-recruiting-clinical-pharmacists|accessdate=19 July 2017|publisher=Chemist &amp; Druggist|date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also moves to employ care navigators, sometimes an enhanced role for a receptionist, to direct patients to different services such as pharmacy and physiotherapy if a doctor is not needed. In September 2017 270 trained care navigators covering 64,000 patients had been employed across [[Wakefield]]. It was estimated that they had saved 930 GP hours over a 10-month trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Primary care  'Care navigators' to help free up GP schedules|url=https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20203648.article?|accessdate=23 December 2017|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four [[NHS trust]]s: [[Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust]]; [[Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust]]; [[Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust]]; and [[Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust]] have taken over multiple GP practices in the interests of integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How is primary and secondary care integration impacting trusts?|url=http://healthcareleadernews.com/article/how-primary-and-secondary-care-integration-impacting-trusts|accessdate=16 July 2017|publisher=Healthcare Leader|date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Number and size of practices====
599 GP practices closed between 2010‚Äì11 and 2014‚Äì15, while 91 opened and average practice list size increased from 6,610 to 7,171.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nearly 600 GP practices closed since 2010|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/primary-care/nearly-600-gp-practices-closed-since-2010/5087888.article#.VgMdkejkJv4|accessdate=23 September 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 there were 7,613 practices in England, 958 in Scotland, 454 in Wales and 349 in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=General practice in the UK|url=https://www.bma.org.uk/-/media/files/pdfs/.../general-practice.pdf?la=en|accessdate=6 July 2017|publisher=British Medical Association|date=April 2017}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 7435 practices in England and the average practice list size in June 2017 was 7,860. There were 1.35 million patients over 85.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Number of GP practices drops by more than 650 in four years|url=http://www.gponline.com/number-gp-practices-drops-650-four-years/article/1436925|accessdate=16 July 2017|publisher=GP Online|date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a great deal of consolidation into larger practices, especially in England. [[Lakeside Healthcare]] was the largest practice in England in 2014, with 62 partners and more than 100,000 patients. Maintaining general practices in isolated communities has become very challenging, and calls on very different skills and behaviour from that required in large practices where there is increasing specialisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Embracing island life as a GP in Shetland|url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/your-practice/working-life/embracing-island-life-as-a-gp-in-shetland/20032034.article|accessdate=6 July 2017|publisher=Pulse|date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By  1 October 2018, 47 GP practices in England had a list size of 30,000 or more and the average list size had reached 8,420.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sharp rise in GP practices with more than 30,000 patients |url=https://www.gponline.com/sharp-rise-gp-practices-30000-patients/article/1496281 |accessdate=18 October 2018 |publisher=GP Online |date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GP Federation]]s have become popular among English [[General practitioner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='GP federations' are the future of the NHS|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/7419510/GP-federations-are-the-future-of-the-NHS.html|accessdate=23 May 2017|publisher=Telegraph|date=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Local Government Association]] 57 million GP consultations in England in 2015 were for minor conditions and illnesses, 5.2 million of them for blocked noses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Millions of 'unnecessary' GP visits are for coughs and colds, says LGA|url=http://www.thecommissioningreview.com/article/millions-unnecessary-gp-visits-are-coughs-and-colds-says-lga|accessdate=15 December 2016|publisher=Commissioning Review|date=7 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220163916/http://www.thecommissioningreview.com/article/millions-unnecessary-gp-visits-are-coughs-and-colds-says-lga|archive-date=2016-12-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   According to the [[King's Fund]] between 2014 and 2017 the umber of telephone and face-to-face contacts between patients and GPs rose by 7.5% although GP numbers have stagnated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GP contacts with patients up 7.5% in two years|url=http://www.gponline.com/gp-contacts-patients-75-two-years/article/1435259|accessdate=6 July 2017|publisher=GP Online|date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mean consultation length in the UK has increased steadily over time from around 5 mins in the 1950's to around 9¬∑22 min in 2013-2014.&lt;ref name="Irving et al 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017902 |pmid=29118053 |pmc=5695512 |title=International variations in primary care physician consultation time: A systematic review of 67 countries |journal=BMJ Open |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=e017902 |year=2017 |last1=Irving |first1=Greg |last2=Neves |first2=Ana Luisa |last3=Dambha-Miller |first3=Hajira |last4=Oishi |first4=Ai |last5=Tagashira |first5=Hiroko |last6=Verho |first6=Anistasiya |last7=Holden |first7=John }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00620-6 |pmid=27059888 |pmc=4899422 |title=Clinical workload in UK primary care: A retrospective analysis of 100 million consultations in England, 2007‚Äì14 |journal=The Lancet |volume=387 |issue=10035 |pages=2323‚Äì2330 |year=2016 |last1=Hobbs |first1=F D Richard |last2=Bankhead |first2=Clare |last3=Mukhtar |first3=Toqir |last4=Stevens |first4=Sarah |last5=Perera-Salazar |first5=Rafael |last6=Holt |first6=Tim |last7=Salisbury |first7=Chris }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is shorter than the mean consultation length in a number of other developed countries around the world.&lt;ref name="Irving et al 2017"/&gt;

The proportion of patients in England waiting longer than seven days to see a GP has risen from 12.8% in 2012 to 20% in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More patients waiting longer than a week for GP appointments|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/06/more-patients-waiting-longer-than-a-week-for-gp-appointments|accessdate=7 July 2017|publisher=Guardian|date=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial providers are rare in the UK but a private GP service was established at Poole Road Medical Centre in Bournemouth in 2017 where patients can pay to skip waiting lists to see a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS GP practice sets up a private service - by paying up to ¬£145 to jump the queue|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/health/15071421.NHS_GP_practice_sets_up_a_private_service___by_paying_up_to___145_to_jump_the_queue/|accessdate=14 July 2017|publisher=Southern Daily Echo|date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GP at Hand, an online service using  [[Babylon Health]]'s app, was launched in November 2017 by the Lillie Road Health Centre, a conventional GP practice in west London.  It recruited 7000 new patients in its first month, of which 89.6% were between 20 and 45 years old. The service was widely criticised by GPs for cherry picking. Patients with long term medical conditions or who might need home visits were actively discouraged from joining the service.  [[Richard Vautrey]] warned that it risked 'undermining the quality and continuity of care and further fragmenting the service provided to the public'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cherry picking fears confirmed as 7,000 new patients join GP at Hand|url=https://www.gponline.com/cherry-picking-fears-confirmed-7000-new-patients-join-gp-hand/article/1453102|accessdate=25 December 2017|publisher=GP Online|date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patient satisfaction==
85% of patients rate their overall experience of primary care as good in 2016, but practices run by limited companies operating on APMS contracts (a small minority) performed worse on four out of five key indicators - frequency of consulting a preferred doctor, ability to get a convenient appointment, rating of doctor communication skills, ease of contacting the practice by telephone and overall experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GP services run by private firms 'worse for patients'|url=https://www.gponline.com/gp-services-run-private-firms-worse-patients/article/1448878|accessdate=25 December 2017|publisher=GP Online|date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Ireland==
There have been particularly acute problems in general practice in Northern Ireland as it has proved very difficult to recruit doctors in rural practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2o GP surgeries face closure|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/20-gp-surgeries-face-closure-in-northern-ireland-affecting-120000-patients-warns-top-doctor-35379190.html|accessdate=7 July 2017|publisher=Belfast Telegraph|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[British Medical Association]] collected undated resignation letters in 2017 from GPs who threatened to leave the NHS and charge consultation fees.  They demanded increased funding, more recruitment and improved computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NI GPs move step closer to leaving health service|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-38745618|accessdate=7 July 2017|publisher=BBC News|date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new GP contract was announced in June 2018 by the Northern Ireland Department of Health. It included funding for practice-based pharmacists, an extra ¬£1 million for increased indemnity costs, ¬£1.8 million because of population growth, and ¬£1.5 million for premises upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Funding boost for general practice in Northern Ireland |url=http://www.onmedica.com/newsArticle.aspx?id=d5d82161-2141-47f8-8f55-4ba19199f692&amp;utm_source=eshot&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20180613_CSNews_Promo |accessdate=31 August 2018 |publisher=OnMedica |date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5152">'''Guy Aoki''' (born May 12, 1962) is a [[Japanese-American]] civil rights activist. He is the leader of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans, which he co-founded in 1992.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3076585.stm|title=Banzai sparks US protests|publisher=BBC NEWS|date=July 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/manaaLA?v=info Facebook page of group listing year of founding]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Asian America Through the Lens: History, Representation and Identities|author=Jun Xing, Chun Hsing|year=1998|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0-7619-9176-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/S15327728JMME1601_6|url=http://www.leaonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327728JMME1601_6?cookieSet=1&amp;journalCode=jmme|title= Book Reviews| journal=Journal of Mass Media Ethics |volume= 16 |issue=1 |page=62 |accessdate=2008-01-06|last=|first=|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a contributing columnist for the ''[[Rafu Shimpo]]'', and debates publicly on [[Asian American]] issues.  During the 1980s, Aoki was part of the production staff for the ''[[American Top 40]]'' radio program.

==Campaigns==

===Sarah Silverman controversy===
In July 2001, Aoki became embroiled in a public controversy stemming from his objection to a joke told by comedian [[Sarah Silverman]], which involved her use of the [[term of disparagement|ethnic slur]] "[[chink]]", in an interview on the July 11, 2001 episode of ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Late Night with Conan O'Brien" July 11, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In the interview, Silverman explained that a friend had advised her on how to avoid [[jury|jury duty]] by writing a racial slur on the selection form, "something really inappropriate, like, 'I hate chinks'." However, Silverman said that she ultimately decided that she did not want to be thought of as a [[racism|racist]] and instead wrote, "I ''love'' chinks." The [[Associated Press]] quoted Aoki: "There is no excuse for something like this to have made the air. The term is the most offensive possible reference to a person of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent." [[NBC]] and [[Conan O'Brien]] issued an apology, but Silverman did not, insisting later on the July 26, 2001 episode of ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' that she did not believe that Aoki was genuinely offended, but exploiting the opportunity for publicity.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Politically Incorrect]]''. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. July 26, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Silverman and Aoki later appeared together on the August 22, 2001 episode of ''[[Politically Incorrect]],'' along with host [[Bill Maher]] and panelists [[David Spade]] and [[Anne-Marie Johnson]], the latter of whom was chair of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] Ethnic Employment Opportunity Committee.  After Silverman repeated the joke for exposition's sake, she opined that it made an implicit statement about the wrongness of [[racism]], rather than legitimizing it. Johnson, however, questioned the humor in the joke, and Aoki opined that such slurs should not be used in an off-the-cuff manner because it legitimized their use, and that use of the word "chink" was no better than the use of the word "[[nigger]]". Aoki, while acknowledging that [[satire]] was a legitimate practice, asserted that Silverman's execution of it was not successful because it ran the risk that people would assume she actually subscribed to the racist viewpoint of her character.

===''Banzai'' controversy===
In July 2003 Media Action Network protested the British program [[Banzai (TV series)|''Banzai'']], which is produced by [[Channel 4]]. Following the first U.S. broadcast of the series on the [[Fox Network]] on July 13, 2003, the Media Action Network accused the program, a spoof betting show that parodies Japanese game shows, of employing demeaning stereotypes of Asians. About 20 members of the group carried signs and shouted slogans outside a presentation by the Fox network to TV critics in Hollywood. Aoki commented, "This is like an Asian minstrel show. Can you imagine the black version of Banzai?" Fox spokesman Scott Grogin responded by saying, "We've received an entire range of comments on the show, both pro and con", and that as a satire, the show should be viewed as "tongue-in-cheek". According to Aoki, in discussions with the MANAA, Fox offered to include a disclaimer at the beginning of the show, but Aoki indicated that this would not assuage the MANAA, who wished the program not be broadcast at all.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7852">The '''Harvard Analytical Framework''', also called the '''Gender Roles Framework''', is one of the earliest frameworks for understanding differences between men and women in their participation in the economy. Framework-based [[gender analysis]] has great importance in helping policy makers understand the economic case for allocating development resources to women as well as men.&lt;ref name="Ochola" /&gt;

==History==
The framework has its origins in 1980 with a request to [[Harvard University]] for [[Women In Development]] (WID) training from the [[World Bank]]. James Austin, who was well known for case-method training at Harvard, led a team with three women experienced in WID work: [[Catherine Overholt]], Mary Anderson and Kathleen Cloud.  These became known as the "Harvard Team".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |title=Gender Planning and Development: Theory, Practice and Training
 |author=Caroline Moser
 |publisher=Routledge |year=2002
 |ISBN=0-203-41194-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The framework was elaborated by the [[Harvard Institute for International Development]] in collaboration with the WID office of [[USAID]], and was first described in 1984 by Catherine Overholt and others. It was one of the earliest of such frameworks.&lt;ref name=Ochola/&gt;
The starting point for the framework was the assumption that it makes economic sense for development aid projects to allocate resources to women as well as men, which will make development more efficient ‚Äì a position named the ‚Äúefficiency approach".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Framework for People Oriented Planning in Refugee Situations, more often called the People-Oriented Planning Framework, or POP, is a framework based on the Harvard Framework that tries to overcome some of its initial weaknesses, and is designed for use in emergency situations. POP was developed for the [[United Nations High Commission for Refugees]].&lt;ref name=March1999/&gt;
Other frameworks include [[Caroline Moser]]'s ''Gender Planning Framework'', [[Naila Kabeer]]'s ''Social Relations Framework'' and the ''Womens Empowerment Framework''.&lt;ref name=nzaid/&gt;

==The framework==
The Harvard Analytical Framework is used to collect information from the community and from households. 
It describes who does each activity, who has access and control of resources and the influences on gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.acdi-cida.gc.ca/acdi-cida/ACDI-CIDA.nsf/En/JUD-31194519-KBD
 |title=Gender Analysis
 |publisher=Canadian International Development Agency
 |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/region/asro/mdtmanila/training/unit1/harvrdfw.htm
 |title=Unit 1: A conceptual framework for gender analysis and planning
 |publisher=International Labour Organization (ILO) 
 |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Activity Profile'' answers the question "Who does what?" for all relevant productive and reproductive tasks.
The ''Access and Control Profile'' identifies the resources used in the tasks identified in the ''Activity Profile'', and defines who has access to these resources and who controls their use.  It also identifies the benefits that are realized from each activity, and who has access to and control over these benefits. The final ''Influencing factors'' section identifies factors that cause the differences of roles of each gender identified in the two profiles. These may indicate areas where there is opportunity to change gender roles.&lt;ref name=WFP/&gt;
A project using the framework will have identification, design, implementation and evaluation stages. The framework also provides a series of checklists, questions to be asked at each stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://en.wsic.ac.cn/baike/1489.htm
 |title=The Harvard Analytical Framework
 |publisher=Chinese Women's Research Network
 |date=2010-11-22
 |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more complete description of the framework is given in ''A Case Book: Gender Roles in Development Projects'' edited by Catherine Overholt, Mary B. Anderson, Kathleen Cloud, James E. Austin, published by Kumariyan Press in 1985.&lt;ref name=WFP/&gt;

==Strengths and weaknesses==
Being neutral and fact-oriented, the framework is useful in starting discussion on gender-related issues with people who otherwise resist thinking about the balance of power between men and women. It is also useful in presenting information to people who tend to see decisions in economic terms.&lt;ref name=March1999/&gt;
The framework applies best to projects addressing agricultural or rural based communities, or that are seeking poverty reduction through implementing a sustainable livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/192862/annexes/Annex6.pdf

 |publisher=World Bank
 |date=June 9‚Äì21, 1996
 |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harvard Framework focuses on projects rather than programs, and on efficiency rather than effectiveness. It does not help identify strategic gender needs and gives no guidance on changing gender inequalities.&lt;ref name=nzaid/&gt;
The framework assumes that gender needs should be addressed for the sake of economic efficiency, and gives less importance to the concepts of equity, power relations or decision-making processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://go.worldbank.org/T6TMWPLVN0
 |title=Tool Name: Harvard Analytical Framework
 |publisher=World Bank
 |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The top-down check-box approach leads to simplification, ignoring the subjects' analysis of their situation and ignoring factors such as race, class, ethnicity and other types of relationships, essential in progressing efficiency itself.&lt;ref name=nzaid/&gt;

The latest, from 2017, counted 6,635 homeless people in Denmark.&lt;ref name=HusForbi2018&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.husforbi.dk/undervisning/hvad-er-en-hjemloes/|title=Hvor mange er hjeml√∏se?|trans-title=How many are homeless?|website=Hus Forbi|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SFI2017&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pure.sfi.dk/ws/files/923630/Hjeml_shed_i_Danmark_2017.pdf|title=Hjeml√∏shed i Danmark 2017 ‚Äî National kortl√¶gning|trans-title=Homeless in Denmark 2017 ‚Äî National mapping|website=sfi.dk|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of people experiencing homelessness at some point in 2017 was estimated at 13,000,&lt;ref name=HusForbi2018/&gt; while earlier estimates have placed it between 10,000 and 15,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanityinaction.org/knowledgebase/9-homelessness-in-a-welfare-state-perspectives-from-copenhagen|title=Homelessness In A Welfare State: Perspectives From Copenhagen by Rasmus Christensen, Nicole Kirkwood - Humanity in Action|website=Humanity In Action}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly half the homeless are in the [[Capital Region of Denmark|Capital Region]].&lt;ref name=SFI2017/&gt; When compared to many other countries, such as the [[Homelessness in the United States|United States]], the rate of Denmark's homeless is significantly lower, which has been linked to the relatively comprehensive welfare system.&lt;ref name=Benjaminsen2015/&gt;

The number of homeless people in Denmark has risen in recent decades, but this has been most pronounced in people that are between 18 and 29 years old (although 30 to 59 years old remains the largest age group, at 70%), women (although men remains the largest group, at 75%) and immigrants (although Danish citizens remain the largest group).&lt;ref name=HusForbi2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFI2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=habitat&gt;''Strategies to Combat Homelessness''.

Based on the comprehensive count in February 2017, roughly one-tenth of homeless people in Denmark are "street sleepers", with the remaining sleeping in the homes of friends/family, in hotels/hostels, in [[Homeless shelter|shelters]] or alike.&lt;ref name=HusForbi2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFI2017/&gt; The number of street sleepers is higher during the summer,&lt;ref name=HusForbi2018/&gt; and homeless foreigners are overrepresented among them.&lt;ref name=TV2Lorry2016/&gt; Among homeless in Denmark, the primary issue is psychiatric disease in 36% (24% receive treatment), drug addiction in 27% (17% receive treatment) and alcohol addiction in 23% (9% receive treatment). Overall it is estimated that more than half of all homeless people have mental health issues.&lt;ref name=SFI2017/&gt; Compared to many other countries such as the United States, a higher percentage of Denmark's homeless have mental health issues or [[substance abuse]], as countries with weaker welfare systems tend to have higher homeless rates but the homeless will more likely to include from a wide range of groups.&lt;ref name=Benjaminsen2015&gt;Benjaminsen, Lars, and Stefan Bastholm Andrade.

The government of Denmark's approach to homelessness include commissioning national surveys on homelessness during the last decade that allow for direct comparison between Denmark, [[Norway]] and [[Homelessness in Sweden|Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Geertsema, Volker. "Defining and measuring homelessness."

The character is portrayed as a ''[[Moe (slang)|moe]]''-style girl.

==Overview==
ISIS-chan was originally conceived by users of 2channel as a response to the propaganda of the [[Islamic terrorism]] group [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] (aka ISIL).&lt;ref name=rudaw24072015/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn35067864&gt;{{Cite web|date=2015-07-24 |url=http://www.cnn.co.jp/tech/35067864.html|title=„Ç¢„Éã„É°„Åä„Åü„Åè„Åå„ÄåÔº©Ôº≥Ôº©Ôº≥„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì„Äç„ÅßÈÅéÊøÄÊ¥æ„Å®Êà¶„ÅÜ|work=CNNMoney|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zakzak1508101203006&gt;{{Cite web|date=2015-08-10|url=http://www.zakzak.co.jp/society/foreign/news/20150810/frn1508101203006-n1.htm|title=ÂØæ„Äå„Ç§„Çπ„É©„É†ÂõΩ„Äç„Éç„ÉÉ„ÉàÂ±ïÈñã„ÄÄ„Ç¢„Éã„É°„Ç≠„É£„É©„ÅßÂÆ£‰ºùÊà¶|work=[[Kyodo News]]|publisher=[[Sankei Shimbun]]|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=biglobe9158453173&gt;{{Cite web|date=2015-07-22 |url=http://news.biglobe.ne.jp/international/0722/blnews_150722_9158453173.html|title=ÂåøÂêç„Éè„ÉÉ„Ç´„ÉºÈõÜÂõ£„Äå„Ç¢„Éé„Éã„Éû„Çπ„Äç„Åå„ÄåISIS„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì„Äç„ÅÆÁîªÂÉè„ÇíÂ§ßÈáèÈÄÅ‰ø°„Åó„Å¶„Ç§„Çπ„É©„É†ÂõΩ„ÅÆÂ∫ÉÂ†±Ê¥ªÂãï„ÇíÂ¶®ÂÆ≥„Åã|work=[[BIGLOBE]]|publisher=[[BIGLOBE]]|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character is a [[moe anthropomorphism]] of ISIL and soon became a [[internet meme|meme]] across some Japanese social media.&lt;ref name=biglobe9158453173/&gt;

Their intentions were to flood the web with ISIS-chan's images to make the character rank highly in Google's [[search engine]] results ([[Google bomb]]).&lt;ref name=thetimes4549102/&gt;&lt;ref name=moneycnnisis-chan/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn35067864-2&gt;{{Cite web|date=2015-07-24 |url=http://www.cnn.co.jp/tech/35067864-2.html|title=„Ç¢„Éã„É°„Åä„Åü„Åè„Åå„ÄåÔº©Ôº≥Ôº©Ôº≥„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì„Äç„ÅßÈÅéÊøÄÊ¥æ„Å®Êà¶„ÅÜ|work=CNNMoney|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If things go well, they hoped that an Internet search for ISIS will come up with the moe character instead of militant propaganda sites.&lt;ref name=rudaw24072015&gt;{{Cite web|date=2015-07-24 |url=http://rudaw.net/english/lifestyle/24072015|title=Isis chops melons instead of heads |author=Alexandra Di Stefano Pironti|publisher=[[:en:Rudaw Media Network|Rudaw Media Network]]|language=English|accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The campaign has become a part of the social media war that the US and the UK have already launched against ISIS.&lt;ref name=rudaw24072015/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47671">'''International humanitarian law''' ('''IHL''') is the law that regulates the conduct of [[war]] (''[[jus in bello]]''). It is that branch of [[international law]] which seeks to limit the effects of armed conflict by protecting persons who are not participating in hostilities, and by restricting and regulating the means and methods of warfare available to [[combatant]]s.

IHL is inspired by considerations of humanity and the mitigation of human suffering. "It comprises a set of rules, established by treaty or custom, that seeks to protect persons and property/objects that are (or may be) affected by armed conflict and limits the rights of parties to a conflict to use methods and means of warfare of their choice".&lt;ref&gt;GSDRC (2013). International legal frameworks for humanitarian action: Topic guide. Birmingham, UK: GSDRC, University of Birmingham http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic-guides/ilfha {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718155209/http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic-guides/ilfha |date=2013-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes "the [[Geneva Conventions]] and the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]], as well as subsequent treaties, [[case law]], and [[customary international law]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]]''[http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/humanitarian-law-factsheet What is international humanitarian law?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320035319/http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/humanitarian-law-factsheet |date=2007-03-20 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; It defines the conduct and responsibilities of [[belligerent]] nations, [[neutral nations]], and individuals engaged in warfare, in relation to each other and to ''protected persons'', usually meaning [[non-combatant]]s. It is designed to balance humanitarian concerns and [[military necessity]], and subjects warfare to the rule of law by limiting its destructive effect and mitigating human suffering.&lt;ref&gt;GSDRC (2013). International legal frameworks for humanitarian action: Topic guide. Birmingham, UK: GSDRC, University of Birmingham http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic-guides/ilfha {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718155209/http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic-guides/ilfha |date=2013-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious violations of international humanitarian law are called [[war crimes]]. International humanitarian law, ''[[jus in bello]]'', regulates the conduct of forces when engaged in war or armed conflict. It is distinct from ''[[jus ad bellum]]'' which regulates the conduct of engaging in war or armed conflict and includes [[crimes against peace]] and of [[war of aggression]]. Together the ''jus in bello'' and ''jus ad bellum'' comprise the two strands of the [[laws of war]] governing all aspects of international armed conflicts.

The law is mandatory for nations bound by the appropriate treaties. There are also other customary unwritten rules of war, many of which were explored at the [[Nuremberg War Trials]]. By extension, they also define both the ''permissive'' rights of these powers as well as ''prohibitions'' on their conduct when dealing with irregular forces and non-signatories.

International humanitarian law operates on a strict division between rules applicable in international armed conflict and [[civil war|internal armed conflict]]. This dichotomy is widely criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stewart|first=James |title=Towards a Single Definition of Armed Conflict in International Humanitarian Law|journal=International Review of the Red Cross |date=30 June 2003|volume=850|pages=313‚Äì350|ssrn=1946414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between [[international human rights law]] and international humanitarian law is disputed among international law scholars. This discussion forms part of a larger discussion on fragmentation of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koskenniemi|first1=Marti|title=Fragmentation of International Law? Postmodern Anxieties|journal=Leiden Journal of International Law|date=September 2002|volume=15|issue=3 |pages=553‚Äì579 |doi=10.1017/S0922156502000262 |url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0922156502000262 |accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While pluralist scholars conceive international human rights law as being distinct from international humanitarian law, proponents of the constitutionalist approach regard the latter as a subset of the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yun|first1=Seira |title=Breaking Imaginary Barriers: Obligations of Armed Non-State Actors Under General Human Rights Law ‚Äì The Case of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child|journal=Journal of International Humanitarian Legal Studies|year=2014|volume=5|issue=1-2|pages=213‚Äì257|ssrn=2556825}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a nutshell, those who favor separate, self-contained regimes emphasize the differences in applicability; international humanitarian law applies only during armed conflict. On the other hand, a more systemic perspective explains that international humanitarian law represents a function of international human rights law; it includes general norms that apply to everyone at all time as well as specialized norms which apply to certain situations such as armed conflict and [[military occupation]] (i.e., IHL) or to certain groups of people including [[refugees]] (e.g., the 1951 [[Refugee Convention]]), children (the 1989 [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]), and [[prisoners of war]] (the 1949 [[Third Geneva Convention]]).

Democracies are likely to protect the rights of all individuals within their territorial jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davenport |first1=Christian |last2=Armstrong |first2=David A. |title=Democracy and the Violation of Human Rights: A Statistical Analysis from 1976 to 1996 |journal=American Journal of Political Science |year = 2004 |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages = 538‚Äì554 |jstor = 1519915 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Two historical streams: The Law of Geneva and The Law of The Hague ==
Modern international humanitarian law is made up of two historical streams:
# The law of The Hague, referred to in the past as the law of war proper; and
# The law of Geneva, or humanitarian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pictet, Jean |title = Humanitarian law and the protection of war victims |publisher=Sijthoff |location=Leyden |year=1975|isbn=90-286-0305-0  |pages = 16‚Äì17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two streams take their names from a number of international conferences which drew up treaties relating to war and conflict, in particular the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, and the Geneva Conventions, the first which was drawn up in 1863.  Both deal with ''[[jus in bello]]'', which deals with the question of whether certain practices are acceptable during armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;The Program for Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research at Harvard University, "Brief Primer on IHL," Accessed at [http://ihl.ihlresearch.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=2083 IHL.ihlresearch.or] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419104833/http://ihl.ihlresearch.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=2083 |date=2010-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law of The Hague, or the [[laws of war]] proper, "determines the rights and duties of belligerents in the conduct of operations and limits the choice of means in doing harm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pictet, Jean |title=Development and Principles of International Law |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dHV7fix7nLcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=international+humanitarian+law&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |location=Dordrecht |year=1985 |pages= |isbn=90-247-3199-2 |page=2 |access-date=2016-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226105111/http://www.google.com/books?id=dHV7fix7nLcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=international+humanitarian+law&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 |archive-date=2014-02-26 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it concerns itself with

{{Main|Laws of War}}

Systematic attempts to limit the savagery of warfare only began to develop in the 19th century.  Such concerns were able to build on the changing view of warfare by states influenced by the Age of Enlightenment. The purpose of warfare was to overcome the enemy state, which could be done by disabling the enemy combatants. Thus, "the distinction between combatants and civilians, the requirement that wounded and captured enemy combatants must be treated humanely, and that quarter must be given, some of the pillars of modern humanitarian law, all follow from this principle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Greenwood |editor-last = Fleck |editor-first=Dieter |title=The Handbook of Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflicts |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA |year=2008 |isbn=0-19-923250-4 |page = 20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Law of Geneva ==
The massacre of civilians in the midst of armed conflict has a long and dark history. Selected examples include
* the massacres of the Kalingas by [[Ashoka#Conquest of Kalinga|Ashoka]] in India;
* the massacre of some 100,000 Hindus by the Muslim troops of [[Timur#Indian campaign|Timur]] (Tamerlane); and
* the Crusader massacres of Jews and Muslims in the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)#The final assault|Siege of Jerusalem (1099)]],

to name only a few examples drawn from a long list in history. Fritz Munch sums up historical military practice before 1800: "The essential points seem to be these: In battle and in towns taken by force, combatants and non-combatants were killed and property was destroyed or looted."&lt;ref&gt;"Fritz Munch, History of the Laws of War, in: R. Bernhardt (ed.), Encyclopedia of Public International Law Volume IV (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;1386‚Äì8.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 17th century, the Dutch jurist [[Hugo Grotius]], widely regarded as the founder or father of public international law, wrote that "wars, for the attainment of their objects, it cannot be denied, must employ force and terror as their most proper agents".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/gro/djbp_301.htm |title=Grotius, Book 3, Chapter 1:VI. |access-date=2009-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430113017/http://www.constitution.org/gro/djbp_301.htm |archive-date=2009-04-30 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Humanitarian norms in history ===
Even in the midst of the carnage of history, however, there have been frequent expressions and invocation of humanitarian norms for the protection of the victims of armed conflicts: the wounded, the sick and the shipwrecked. These date back to ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bernhardt, Rudolf |title=Encyclopedia of public international law |publisher=North-Holland |location=Amsterdam |year=1992 |isbn=0-444-86245-5 |oclc= |doi= |volume = Volume 2 |pages = 933‚Äì936 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Old Testament, the King of Israel prevents the slaying of the captured, following the prophet Elisha's admonition to spare enemy prisoners. In answer to a question from the King, Elisha said, "You shall not slay them. Would you slay those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ebible.com/bible/II%20Kings%206%3A%2021-23 |title=II Kings 6:21-23 |access-date=2009-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710164727/http://ebible.com/bible/II%20Kings%206:%2021-23 |archive-date=2011-07-10 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient India there are records (the [[Manusmrti|Laws of Manu]], for example) describing the types of weapons that should not be used: "When he fights with his foes in battle, let him not strike with weapons concealed (in wood), nor with (such as are) barbed, poisoned, or the points of which are blazing with fire."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/manu/manu07.htm |title=The Laws of Manu VII.90 |access-date=2009-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530202553/http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/manu/manu07.htm |archive-date=2009-05-30 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the command not to strike a eunuch nor the enemy "who folds his hands in supplication&amp;nbsp;...

Islamic law did not spare all non-combatants, however. In the case of those who refused to convert to Islam, or to pay an alternative tax, Muslims "were allowed in principle to kill any one of them, combatants or noncombatants, provided they were not killed treacherously and with mutilation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Khadduri, Majid |title=War And Peace in the Law of Islam |publisher=Lawbook Exchange |location=New York, NY |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=1-58477-695-1 |oclc= |doi= }}pp.&amp;nbsp;105‚Äì106.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Codification of humanitarian norms ===
The most important antecedent of IHL is the current Armistice Agreement and Regularization of War, signed and ratified in 1820 between the authorities of the then Government of Great Colombia and the Chief of the Expeditionary Forces of the Spanish Crown, in the Venezuelan city of santa Ana de Trujillo. This treaty was signed under the conflict of Independence, being the first of its kind in the West.

It was not until the second half of the 19th century, however, that a more systematic approach was initiated. In the United States, a German immigrant, [[Francis Lieber]], drew up a code of conduct in 1863, which came to be known as the [[Lieber Code]], for the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. The Lieber Code included the humane treatment of civilian populations in the areas of conflict, and also forbade the execution of [[POWs]].

At the same time, the involvement during the [[Crimean War]] of a number of such individuals as [[Florence Nightingale]] and [[Henry Dunant]], a Genevese businessman who had worked with wounded soldiers at the [[Battle of Solferino]], led to more systematic efforts to prevent the suffering of war victims. Dunant wrote a book, which he titled ''[[A Memory of Solferino]]'', in which he described the horrors he had witnessed. His reports were so shocking that they led to the founding of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) in 1863, and the convening of a conference in Geneva in 1864, which drew up the [[First Geneva Convention|Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Greenwood |editor-last = Fleck |editor-first=Dieter |title=The Handbook of Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflicts |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA |year=2008 |isbn=0-19-923250-4 |page = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
The Law of Geneva is directly inspired by the [[Humanitarian principles#Humanity|principle of humanity]]. It relates to those who are not participating in the conflict, as well as to military personnel ''hors de combat''. It provides the legal basis for protection and [[humanitarian assistance]] carried out by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the ICRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dHV7fix7nLcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=international+humanitarian+law&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 |title=Pictet (1985) p.2. |access-date=2016-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226105111/http://www.google.com/books?id=dHV7fix7nLcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=international+humanitarian+law&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 |archive-date=2014-02-26 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This focus can be found in the [[Geneva Conventions]].

{{Main|Geneva Conventions}}

The '''Geneva Conventions''' are the result of a process that developed in a number of stages between 1864 and 1949. It focused on the protection of civilians and those who can no longer fight in an armed conflict. As a result of World War II, all four conventions were revised, based on previous revisions and on some of the 1907 Hague Conventions, and readopted by the international community in 1949. Later conferences have added provisions prohibiting certain methods of warfare and addressing issues of civil wars.

The first three Geneva Conventions were revised, expanded, and replaced, and the fourth one was added, in 1949.

* The Geneva Convention ''for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field'' was adopted in 1864. It was significantly revised and replaced by the 1906 version,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/INTRO/180?OpenDocument |title=Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field.

* The Geneva Convention ''for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea'' was adopted in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The International Committee of the Red Cross: A Neutral Humanitarian Actor |date=June 17, 2007 |author=David P. Forsythe |page=43 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-415-34151-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was significantly revised and replaced by the [[Second Geneva Convention]] of 1949.
* The [[Geneva Convention (1929)|Geneva Convention ''relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War'' was adopted in 1929]]. It was significantly revised and replaced by the [[Third Geneva Convention]] of 1949.
* The [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] ''relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War'' was adopted in 1949.

There are three additional amendment protocols to the Geneva Convention:

# [[Protocol I]] (1977): Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts. As of 12 January 2007 it had been ratified by 167 countries.
# [[Protocol II]] (1977): Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts. As of 12 January 2007 it had been ratified by 163 countries.
# [[Protocol III]] (2005): Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem. As of June 2007 it had been ratified by seventeen countries and signed but not yet ratified by an additional 68.

The Geneva Conventions of 1949 may be seen, therefore, as the result of a process which began in 1864. Today they have "achieved universal participation with 194 parties". This means that they apply to almost any international armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Greenwood |editor-last = Fleck |editor-first=Dieter |title=The Handbook of Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflicts |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA |year=2008 |isbn=0-19-923250-4 |pp = 27‚Äì28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Additional Protocols, however, have yet to achieve near-universal acceptance, since the United States and several other significant military powers (like Iran, Israel, India and Pakistan) are currently not parties to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic-guides/ilfha |title={title} |access-date=2013-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718155209/http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic-guides/ilfha |archive-date=2013-07-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical convergence between IHL and the laws of war ==
With the adoption of the [[Geneva Conventions#Protocols|1977 Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions]], the two strains of law began to converge, although provisions focusing on humanity could already be found in the Hague law (i.e. the protection of certain prisoners of war and civilians in occupied territories). The 1977 Additional Protocols, relating to the protection of victims in both international and internal conflict, not only incorporated aspects of both the Law of The Hague and the Law of Geneva, but also important human rights provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/p0793/$File/ICRC_002_0793.PDF!Open |title=Kalshoven+Zegveld (2001) p. 34. |access-date=2008-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008210214/http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/p0793/$File/ICRC_002_0793.PDF!Open |archive-date=2007-10-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic rules of IHL ==
# Persons who are ''[[hors de combat]]'' (outside of combat), and those who are not taking part in hostilities in situation of armed conflict (e.g., [[Country neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] [[nationality|nationals]]), shall be protected in all circumstances.
# The wounded and the sick shall be cared for and protected by the party to the conflict which has them in its power. The emblem of the "Red Cross", or of the "Red Crescent," shall be required to be respected as the sign of protection.
# Captured persons must be protected against acts of violence and reprisals. They shall have the right to correspond with their families and to receive relief.
# No one shall be subjected to [[torture]] or to [[cruel and unusual punishment|cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment]].
# Parties to a conflict do not have an unlimited choice of methods and means of [[warfare]].
# Parties to a conflict shall at all times distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Attacks shall be directed solely against [[legitimate military target]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/p0365  {{cite book |author=de Preux |title = Basic rules of the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols, 2nd edition |publisher=ICRC |location=Geneva |year=1988|isbn= |oclc= |doi= |page = 1 }}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
Well-known examples of such rules include the prohibition on attacking [[physician|doctors]] or [[ambulance]]s displaying a [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|red cross]]. It is also prohibited to fire at a person or vehicle bearing a white flag, since that, being considered the flag of truce, indicates an intent to surrender or a desire to communicate. In either case, the persons protected by the Red Cross or the white flag are expected to maintain neutrality, and may not engage in warlike acts themselves; engaging in war activities under a white flag or a red cross is itself a violation of the laws of war.

These examples of the laws of war address:
* [[declarations of war]];{{efn|The [[UN Charter]] (1945) Article 2, and some other Articles in the charter, curtails the right of member states to declare war, as does the older and toothless [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]] of 1928 for those nations who ratified it, but used against Germany in the Nuremberg War Trials.}}
* acceptance of surrender;
* the treatment of prisoners of war;
* the avoidance of atrocities;
*the prohibition on deliberately attacking non-combatants; and
*the prohibition of certain inhumane [[weapons]].

It is a violation of the laws of war to engage in combat without meeting certain requirements, among them the wearing of a distinctive [[uniform]] or other easily identifiable badge, and the carrying of weapons openly. Impersonating soldiers of the other side by wearing the enemy's uniform is allowed, though fighting in that uniform is unlawful [[perfidy]], as is the taking of [[hostage]]s.

== Later additions ==
International humanitarian law now includes several treaties that outlaw specific weapons. These conventions were created largely because these weapons cause deaths and injuries long after conflicts have ended. Unexploded [[land mines]] have caused up to 7,000 deaths a year; unexploded bombs, particularly from [[cluster bombs]] that scatter many small "bomblets", have also killed many. An estimated 98% of the victims are civilian; farmers tilling their fields and children who find these explosives have been common victims. For these reasons, the following conventions have been adopted:

* The [[Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects]] (1980), which prohibits weapons that produce non-detectable fragments, restricts (but does not eliminate) the use of [[Land mine|mine]]s and [[booby-traps]], prohibits attacking civilians with [[incendiary weapons]], prohibits [[Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons|blinding laser weapons]], and requires the warring parties to clear unexploded ordnance at the end of hostilities;{{efn|As of December 2012, 109 states have ratified this convention or some of its provisions.}}
* The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction (1997), also called the [[Ottawa Treaty]] or the Mine Ban Treaty, which completely bans the stockpiling (except to a limited degree, for training purposes) and use of all [[Anti-personnel mine|anti-personnel]] [[land mines]];{{efn|By late 2012, 160 states had ratified it.}}
* The [[Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict]] (2000), an amendment to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), which forbids the enlistment of anyone under the age of eighteen for armed conflict;{{efn|It has, as of December 2012, been ratified by 150 states.}} and
* The [[Convention on Cluster Munitions]] (2008), which prohibits the use of bombs that scatter bomblets, many of which do not explode and remain dangerous long after a conflict has ended.{{efn|By December 2012, 77 states had ratified it.}}

== International Committee of the Red Cross ==
[[File:Emblem of the ICRC.svg|Emblem of the ICRC|thumb]]
{{Main|International Committee of the Red Cross}}

The ICRC is the only institution explicitly named under international humanitarian law as a controlling authority. The legal mandate of the ICRC stems from the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, as well as from its own Statutes.

{{cquote|The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is an impartial, neutral, and independent organization whose exclusively humanitarian mission is to protect the lives and dignity of victims of war and internal violence and to provide them with assistance.|30px|30px|Mission of ICRC}}

== Violations and punishment ==
During conflict, [[punishment]] for violating the laws of war may consist of a specific, deliberate and limited violation of the laws of war in [[reprisal]].

Combatants who break specific provisions of the laws of war lose the protections and status afforded to them as [[prisoners of war]], but only after facing a "competent tribunal".&lt;ref&gt;[[Third Geneva Convention|GC III]] Art 5.&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, they become [[unlawful combatant]]s, but must still be "treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the [[Right to a fair trial|rights of fair and regular trial]]", because they are still covered by [[Fourth Geneva Convention#Article 5: Derogations|GC IV, Article 5]].

[[Espionage|Spies]] and [[terrorism|terrorists]] are only protected by the laws of war if the "power" which holds them is in a state of armed conflict or war, and until they are found to be an "unlawful combatant". Depending on the circumstances, they may be subject to civilian law or a military tribunal for their acts. In practice, they have often have been subjected to [[torture]] and execution. The laws of war neither approve nor condemn such acts, which fall outside their scope.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Spies may only be punished following a trial; if captured after rejoining their own army, they must be treated as prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/full/195 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911164351/http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/195 |date=2012-09-11 }} Articles 30 and 31&lt;/ref&gt; Suspected terrorists who are captured during an armed conflict, without having participated in the hostilities, may be detained only in accordance with the [[Fourth Geneva Convention|GC IV]], and are entitled to a regular trial.&lt;ref&gt;https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/7951.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826114716/https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/7951.pdf |date=2017-08-26 }} CRS-15&lt;/ref&gt; Countries that have signed the ''[[UN Convention Against Torture]]'' have committed themselves not to use torture on anyone for any reason.

After a conflict has ended, persons who have committed any breach of the laws of war, and especially atrocities, may be held individually accountable for [[war crimes]] through process of [[law]].

== Key provisions and principles applicable to civilians ==
The Fourth Geneva Convention focuses on the civilian population. The two additional protocols adopted in 1977 extend and strengthen civilian protection in international (AP I) and non-international (AP II) armed conflict: for example, by introducing the prohibition of direct attacks against civilians. A "civilian" is defined as "any person not belonging to the armed forces", including non-nationals and refugees.&lt;ref&gt;AP I, Art 50(1).&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is accepted that operations may cause civilian casualties. Luis Moreno Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the international criminal court, wrote in 2006: "International humanitarian law and the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome statute]] permit belligerents to carry out proportionate attacks against military objectives, even when it is known that some civilian deaths or injuries will occur. A crime occurs if there is an intentional attack directed against civilians (principle of distinction) ... or an attack is launched on a military objective in the knowledge that the incidental civilian injuries would be clearly excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage (principle of proportionality)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/20/israelis-die-defend-british-media |title=Cited in an article in The Guardian newspaper |access-date=2016-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807021712/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/20/israelis-die-defend-british-media |archive-date=2017-08-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IHL provisions and principles protecting civilians ===

==== Principle of distinction ====
The principle of distinction protects civilian population and civilian objects from the effects of military operations. It requires parties to an armed conflict to distinguish at all times, and under all circumstances, between combatants and military objectives on the one hand, and civilians and civilian objects on the other; and only to target the former. It also provides that civilians lose such protection should they take a direct part in hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;AP I, Arts 48, 51-52, 57; AP II, 13-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of distinction has also been found by the ICRC to be reflected in state practice; it is therefore an established norm of customary international law in both international and non-international armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;ICRC, 2005b, vol 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Necessity and proportionality ====
Necessity and [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]] are established principles in humanitarian law. Under IHL, a belligerent may apply only the amount and kind of force necessary to defeat the enemy. Further, attacks on military objects must not cause loss of civilian life considered excessive in relation to the direct military advantage anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;AP I, Arts 35, 51(5).&lt;/ref&gt; Every feasible precaution must be taken by commanders to avoid civilian casualties.&lt;ref&gt;AP 1, Arts 57, 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of proportionality has also been found by the ICRC to form part of customary international law in international and non-international armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;ICRC, 2005b, vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Principle of humane treatment ====
The principle of humane treatment requires that civilians be treated humanely at all times.&lt;ref&gt;GCIV, Art 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Common Article 3 of the GCs prohibits violence to life and person (including cruel treatment and torture), the taking of hostages, humiliating and degrading treatment, and execution without regular trial against non-combatants, including persons ''[[hors de combat]]'' (wounded, sick and shipwrecked). Civilians are entitled to respect for their physical and mental integrity, their honour, family rights, religious convictions and practices, and their manners and customs.&lt;ref&gt;API, Art 75(1).&lt;/ref&gt; This principle of humane treatment has been affirmed by the ICRC as a norm of customary international law, applicable in both international and non-international armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;ICRC, 2005b, vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Principle of non-discrimination ====
The principle of non-discrimination is a core principle of IHL. Adverse distinction based on race, sex, nationality, religious belief or political opinion is prohibited in the treatment of prisoners of war,&lt;ref&gt;GCIII, Art 16.&lt;/ref&gt; civilians,&lt;ref&gt;GCIV, Art 13, common Article 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and persons ''hors de combat''.&lt;ref&gt;Common Article 3.&lt;/ref&gt; All protected persons shall be treated with the same consideration by parties to the conflict, without distinction based on race, religion, sex or political opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Common article 3, GCIV, Art 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Each and every person affected by armed conflict is entitled to his fundamental rights and guarantees, without discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;API, Art 75(1).&lt;/ref&gt; The prohibition against adverse distinction is also considered by the ICRC to form part of customary international law in international and non-international armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;ICRC, 2005b, vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women and children ====
Women and children are granted preferential treatment, respect and protection. Women must be protected from rape and from any form of indecent assault. Children under the age of eighteen must not be permitted to take part in hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;GCIV, Arts 24, 27; API, Arts 76-78; APII, Art 4(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender and culture ==
=== Gender ===
IHL emphasises, in various provisions in the GCs and APs, the concept of formal equality and non-discrimination. Protections should be provided "without any adverse distinction founded on sex". For example, with regard to female prisoners of war, women are required to receive treatment "as favourable as that granted to men".&lt;ref&gt;GCIII, Arts 14, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to claims of formal equality, IHL mandates special protections to women, providing female prisoners of war with separate dormitories from men, for example,&lt;ref&gt;GCIII, Art 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and prohibiting sexual [[violence against women]].&lt;ref&gt;GCIV, Art27; API, Art 76(2); APII, Art 4(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

The reality of women's and men's lived experiences of conflict has highlighted some of the gender limitations of IHL. Feminist critics have challenged IHL's focus on male combatants and its relegation of women to the status of victims, and its granting them legitimacy almost exclusively as child-rearers. A study of the 42 provisions relating to women within the Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols found that almost half address women who are expectant or nursing mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Gardam and Jarvis, cited in Durham and O'Bryne, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that the issue of sexual violence against men in conflict has not yet received the attention it deserves.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, cited in Durham and O'Bryne, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soft-law instruments have been relied on to supplement the protection of women in armed conflict:

* [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888|UN Security Council Resolutions 1888]] and 1889 (2009), which aim to enhance the protection of women and children against sexual violations in armed conflict; and
* [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325|Resolution 1325]], which aims to improve the participation of women in post-conflict peacebuilding.

Read together with other legal mechanisms, in particular the UN [[Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW), these can enhance interpretation and implementation of IHL.

In addition, international criminal tribunals (like the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia]] and [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda|Rwanda]]) and mixed tribunals (like the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]]) have contributed to expanding the scope of definitions of sexual violence and rape in conflict. They have effectively prosecuted sexual and gender-based crimes committed during armed conflict. There is now well-established jurisprudence on gender-based crimes. Nonetheless, there remains an urgent need to further develop constructions of gender within international humanitarian law.&lt;ref&gt;See Barrow, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture===
IHL has generally not been subject to the same debates and criticisms of "[[cultural relativism]]" as have [[international human rights law|international human rights]]. Although the modern codification of IHL in the Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols is relatively new, and European in name, the core concepts are not new, and laws relating to warfare can be found in all cultures.

ICRC studies on the Middle East, Somalia, Latin America, and the Pacific, for example have found that there are traditional and long-standing practices in various cultures that preceded, but are generally consistent with, modern IHL. It is important to respect local and cultural practices that are in line with IHL. Relying on these links and on local practices can help to [[raising awareness|promote awareness]] of and adherence to IHL principles among local groups and communities.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Durham cautions that, although traditional practices and IHL legal norms are largely compatible, it is important not to assume perfect alignment. There are areas in which legal norms and cultural practices clash. Violence against women, for example, is frequently legitimised by arguments from culture, and yet is prohibited in IHL and other international law. In such cases, it is important to ensure that IHL is not negatively affected.

'''Jane Edward Schilling''' (October 8, 1930 ‚Äì September 13, 2017) was an American activist, historian, and university administrator who served as  founding Vice President of [[Martin University]] in Indianapolis, Indiana.

==Early life==
Born Nancy Mary Schilling in 1930 in the lake resort town of [[Minocqua, Wisconsin]], Jane Schilling was the eldest of five children of Lyle Franklin Schilling, a dentist, and wife, Rosalie Julia Wolk Schilling, a homemaker.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Early on, Nancy excelled in athletics and scholarship. Finding that her high school did not offer the courses she needed to take in order to become a dentist like her father, she moved to [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] to live with two aunts to attend St. Joseph‚Äôs Academy for junior and senior high school. During this period, she found that she had a vocation to follow in the footsteps of her teachers and become a [http://www.csjsl.org/ Sister of St. Joseph of Carondolet].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tribute to Sr. Jane Schilling. 2015 Martin University Founders Day Luncheon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBVrj1JPH8g&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Fern (Snooks) Winger, telephone interview, October 31, 2014, digital tape and typescript, Father Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Jelinski, written responses to interview questions, November 9, 2014, Father Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

During her formation with the Sisters of St. Joseph, she received the name [[Religious sister|Sister]] Jane Edward, a combination of her younger sister‚Äôs and brother‚Äôs names. An avid scholar, she received her bachelor‚Äôs degree in European and American History at [[Fontbonne University]] in Saint Louis and her Master‚Äôs of Ancient History at [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]] in [[Chicago]]. Following her first assignment as a teacher in St. Rita‚Äôs School in [[St. Louis]], she was next assigned to St. Matthew‚Äôs School in the inner city. Here, she developed a passion for civil rights and social justice. She assisted with curriculum development for students at the Saint Louis hospital for black residents, Homer G. Phillips, and assisted in ministering to ex-convicts at nearby [http://www.dismashouse.net/ Dismas House], established by [http://www.dismashouse.net/our-history.html Father Charles "Dismas" Clark] and [[Morris Shenker]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Holy Angels==
In 1964, Schilling's was assigned to teach at [http://www.holyangelscatholicschool.org/ Holy Angels Catholic School] in [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]], a school that had transitioned to a majority black student population. She embraced this role with high energy, establishing a drum and bugle corps to increase school pride and visibility within the community. After she was named principal, she engaged in implementing educational reforms of the time, such as [[open classroom]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[Lateralization of brain function|right/left brain]] teaching, and [[Psychomotor learning|psychomotor]] approaches for teaching reading.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdye Bryant, Margaret Graves, and Doris Parker, ‚ÄúA New Journey of Hope: Holy Angels Catholic Church, 1903-2003‚Äù (Indianapolis: Holy Angels Catholic Church, 2003), 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Sr. Pat Quinn, CSJ, telephone interview, April 29, 2015, digital tape and typescript, Father Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;"Sister Jane Edward Schilling," biography, Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondolet, St. Louis Province, http://www.csjsl.org/news/sister-jane-edward-schilling-1930-2017.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after her arrival at Holy Angels, Schilling's life was radically changed when a new Associate Pastor at Holy Angels Parish, [[Boniface Hardin]], arrived on the scene. The two shared a commitment to education and social change, a bond that created a partnership that would last for the remainder of their lives.

Working together, Schilling and Hardin became activists in church and community reform. They fought police brutality and targeting of black citizens, de facto school [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], lack of representation of black clergy and traditions within the [[Catholic Church]], poverty, and unfair [[Housing discrimination (United States)|housing]] practices. A key focus became the fight to prevent a major highway, [[Interstate 65 in Indiana|Interstate 65]], from bifurcating the predominately black northwest neighborhood surrounding [http://holyangelsindy.org/ Holy Angels Parish].&lt;ref&gt;‚ÄúCORE Threatens Protest in Planned Highway Controversy,‚Äù ''Indianapolis Recorder,'' February 10, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‚ÄúSeek Lawsuit to Halt Construction of Highway thru Negro Community,‚Äù ''Indianapolis Recorder,'' February 3, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

When police pressure on the Archbishop of Indianapolis, [[Paul Clarence Schulte|Paul Schulte]], triggered a decision to remove Hardin from Holy Angels Parish in 1969, parishioners rose up and staged a nationally publicized demonstration in [[Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral (Indianapolis)|Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral]] where the Archbishop was presiding at [[Easter]] services.&lt;ref&gt;"150 Walk Out in a Protest at Indianapolis Cathedral,‚Äù ''The New York Times'', April 7, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Demonstrators Protest Treatment of Priest,‚Äù ''Indianapolis Recorder'', April 12, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Archbishop rescinded his order, Hardin left Holy Angels to found Martin Center, an educational and social justice center, at the close of 1969. Within a year, Schilling received permission from her religious community to work full-time at Martin Center as Education Coordinator.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==The Martin Center==
Martin Center was named for [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[Martin de Porres|St. Martin de Porres]], patron saint, within the Catholic Church, of poor and mixed race people. Its mission evolved from an initial goal of educating clergy and white people about discriminatory attitudes and practices to include celebrating black cultural heritage and engaging black community members in activism and self-identity. While Hardin traveled as a speaker and consultant to raise funds for the Center, Schilling became the day-to-day administrator.

Drawing on her background as a history scholar, Schilling did the research and production of designs and materials for workshops, speeches, and activities of Martin Center. Soon, the mission of the Center expanded to include the [http://themartincenter.org/ Martin Sickle Cell Center], which received major national funding to educate the community and screen for this disease, and the Afro-American Institute, which focused on African and African-American culture and achievements.&lt;ref&gt;"Martin Center‚Äôs success is vehicle by Father Boniface,‚Äù ''Indianapolis Recorder,'' March 11, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Schilling served as Director of Community Education at the Sickle Cell Center from 1970 to 1977 and received its award for 25 Years of Dedication to Sickle Cell and Visionary Leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Father Kenneth Taylor, ‚ÄúSister Jane Schilling: A Model of Faith,‚Äù Indianapolis Recorder, September 28, 2017. http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/religion/article_bb7767ce-a454-11e7-8ce7-13f0c08e208e.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the Afro-American Institute, Martin Center housed a library of materials and artifacts, created and acquired by Schilling and Hardin. They also produced a regular scholarly periodical, the ''Afro-American Journal'' (1973‚Äì78);&lt;ref&gt;Collections of the ''Afro-American Journal'' are in the Indiana University libraries, the Indiana State Library, the Indianapolis Public Library, and the Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt; two full-length TV documentaries‚Äî''The Kingdom Builders'' and ''For Love of Freedom''&lt;ref&gt;Both films are available in their original Betamax format and DVD. Father Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîfor the local NBC affiliate in Indianapolis; a weekly radio program, ''The [https://media.dlib.indiana.edu/?f%5Bcollection_ssim%5D%5B%5D=The+Afro-American+in+Indiana+%28radio+series%29 Afro-American in Indiana]'' (1971-1991) for WIAN, the local public radio station;  and a weekly television show, ''Afro-American'' (1974‚Äì79), for public television. Schilling co-hosted these programs and was the major researcher behind the productions.

As Martin Center expanded its educational offerings to the community, it collaborated with [[Indiana University ‚Äì Purdue University Indianapolis|Indiana University Purdue University-Indianapolis]] to create courses for college credit. This venture led Schilling and Hardin to found Indiana‚Äôs only minority serving institution, [[Martin University]].

==Martin University==
From the start, Schilling's role in the creation and growth of Martin University was chief academic officer, strategist, and educational developer.  As Founding Vice President for Academic Affairs, she was a key voice in articulating the philosophy behind the institution, inspired by the concept of ‚Äú[[andragogy]]‚Äù advanced by [[Malcolm Knowles]]. The approach emphasized drawing on the strengths and past experience of adult learners, the major population of the university. Through her hiring decisions and curriculum and faculty development efforts, Schilling collaborated with Hardin to become the guiding force behind the school‚Äôs educational direction.

Schilling presided over Academic Affairs at Martin University from its early beginnings with a handful of students in 1977 as Martin Center College, through 1979 as Martin College became a separate entity from Martin Center, and finally through 1990, when the addition of graduate programs enabled the change to Martin University, a school with nearly 1000 students. She was the key architect of successful accreditation and expansion proposals to the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (changed in 2014 to the [[Higher Learning Commission]]). She became known at Martin for her sense of humor and the compassion she showed students through acts such as serving soup to those who came directly from work to classes.

While Vice President of Martin University, Schilling participated in numerous initiatives within the Indianapolis community, including serving on the [http://www.crispusattucksmuseum.org/ Crispus Attucks Museum] Committee and acting as consultant and workshop facilitator for the [[Indianapolis Public Schools]]. She continued to guide the Martin Center, serving as its Executive Director from 1984 to 1988.

Schilling received a number of Martin University Awards. These included the Mary McLeod Bethune Award and the Martin University Board of Trustees Wind Under Our Wings Award. In 2005, she received the Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Martin University. After 30 years of service, Schilling retired from Martin University in 2007. She died on September 13, 2017 at Nazareth Living House, Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondolet, St. Louis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="118212">[[Washington, D.C.]] has been the federal [[capital city]] of the [[United States]] since 1790. Each [[U.S. state]] has its own capital city, as do many of its [[insular area]]s. Historically, most states have not changed their capital city since becoming a state, but the capital cities of their respective preceding colonies, territories, kingdoms, and republics typically changed multiple times. There have also been other governments within the current borders of the United States with their own capitals, such as the Republic of Texas, Native American nations, and other unrecognized governments.

* The [[Albany Conference]] (June 18‚ÄìJuly 11, 1754), or "The Conference of Albany", was the first meeting at which representatives of British colonies in North America (seven of them) gathered to discuss questions of common interest. It met in the [[Stadt Huys]], the [[City Hall]] of [[Albany, New York]] (demolished after a fire in 1836). The original purpose of the Conference was to coordinate relations with the Indians and common defensive measures against the French threat from Canada (see [[French and Indian War#Albany Conference]]). At that meeting the major topic of discussion, however, was the [[Albany Plan]], presented by [[Benjamin Franklin]], delegate from [[Pennsylvania]], setting up a unified (though not independent) government for the colonies. Although the delegates approved the plan (after modifications) unanimously, it was not approved by any of the territorial governments, or by the British government. It was used later in the drafting of the [[Articles of Confederation]].
* The [[Stamp Act Congress]] (October 7‚Äì25, 1765), or First Congress of the American Colonies, met in City Hall, today [[Federal Hall]], in [[New York City]].
* The [[Continental Congress]], later called the First Continental Congress (September 5‚ÄìOctober 26, 1774), embryo of what would become the United States government, met in [[Carpenters' Hall]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], today (2018) part of [[Independence National Historical Park]]. Delegate [[Joseph Galloway]] presented the [[Galloway's Plan of Union|Galloway Plan]] for a unified government, incorporating some elements of the Albany Plan, but it was not accepted.
* The [[Second Continental Congress]] (1775‚Äì1781), in which the [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]] was debated and signed, and which starting in 1775 coordinated the [[American Revolutionary War]], met primarily in the Pennsylvania State House, today [[Independence Hall]], in Independence National Historic Park. The room as it was then is accurately depicted in the famous painting [[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|''Declaration of Independence'']] by [[John Trumbull]], commissioned by Congress, which has hung in the [[U.S. Capitol Rotunda]] since 1825. The [[Articles of Confederation]], though drafted in [[York, Pennsylvania]], were adopted in Philadelphia in 1777, subject to the states' approval. The Second Continental Congress also met briefly in the following locations:
** [[Henry Fite House]], [[Baltimore, Maryland]]: December 20, 1776 to February 27, 1777, to avoid capture by British forces. The building was destroyed by fire in 1904.
** Court House, [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]: September 27, 1777 (one day)
** Court House, [[York, Pennsylvania]]: September 30, 1777 to June 2, 1778
** College Hall, [[College of Philadelphia]]: July 2, 1778 to July 20, 1778&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedstatescapitals.org/p/college-hall.html|title=United States Capitols|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Congress of the Confederation]] (1781‚Äì1789) did not have an official capitol. It met in the following locations:
** Independence Hall, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: March 1, 1781 to June 21, 1783 (In 1783 Congress was forced to move from Philadelphia due to a riot of angry soldiers. See [[Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783]].)
** [[Nassau Hall]], [[Princeton, New Jersey]]: June 30, 1783 to November 4, 1783
** [[Maryland State House]], [[Annapolis, Maryland]]: November 26, 1783 to August 19, 1784
** [[French Arms Tavern]], [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[New Jersey]]: November 1, 1784 to December 24, 1784
** [[Federal Hall]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]: January 11, 1785 to October 2, 1788&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedstatescapitals.org/p/federal.html|title=United States Capitols|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demolished in 1812.
** [[Fraunces Tavern]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]: October 6, 1788 to March 3, 1789&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedstatescapitals.org/p/fraunces-tavern.html|title=United States Capitols|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[United States Constitution]] addressed (Article 1, section 8, clause 17) the need for a fixed U.S. Capitol. This led to the establishment of the [[History of the District of Columbia|District of Columbia]] and the founding of Washington as the nation's capitol. Until the Capitol building was completed, and after it was [[Burning of Washington|burned by the British]] in 1814, requiring its rebuilding, Congress met in various places:
** [[Federal Hall]], New York City, New York: March 4, 1789 to December 5, 1790. This is where [[George Washington]] was inaugurated as first [[President of the United States|President]]. Demolished in 1812.
** [[Congress Hall]], Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, adjacent to the Pennsylvania State House (Independence Hall) and also part of Independence National Historic Park: December 6, 1790 to May 14, 1800. Built for the purpose of being the U.S. capitol. This is pursuant to the [[Residence Act]] of 1790, which designated Philadelphia as U.S. Capital for 10 years.
** [[United States Capitol]]. [[History of Washington D.C.|Territory of Columbia]]: November 17, 1800 to February 27, 1801; [[History of Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]: February 27, 1801 to May 2, 1802; [[Washington, D.C.]]: May 3, 1802 to August 24, 1814, when the [[Burning of Washington|British burned it]].
** (President James Madison fled to the home of Quaker Caleb Bentley, in [[Brookeville, Maryland]], where he stayed one night, August 26, 1814. As such, the town claims to have been the "U.S. Capital for a Day", despite the fact that Congress never met there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

** [[Old Capitol Prison|Old Brick Capitol]], Washington, D.C.: December 8, 1815 to 1819 (while the original Capitol was being rebuilt). Although the name says "old", the cornerstone was laid July 4, 1815. It was financed by Washington real-estate investors, who had heard rumors that some members of Congress were considering relocation of the national capital in the aftermath of the burning.
** United States Capitol, Washington, D.C.: 1819 to present

The dates listed in the following table indicate the year in which the city started to continuously serve as the state's sole capital. Most states have changed their capital city at least once. In the case of the thirteen original states, "statehood" in the table refers to date of ratification of the [[United States Constitution]].

==Former national capitals==&lt;!--[[Henry Fite House]] links here--&gt;

===Kingdom and Republic of Hawaii===
Prior to becoming a territory of the United States in 1898, Hawaii was an independent country. Five sites served as its capital:

*[[Waikiki|Waikƒ´kƒ´]].  Served as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], 1795‚Äì1796
*[[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]].  Served as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], 1796‚Äì1803
*[[Kailua, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Kailua-Kona]].  Served as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], 1812‚Äì1820
*[[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]]. Served as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], 1820‚Äì1845.
*[[Honolulu]]
**Served as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], 1803‚Äì1812.
**Served as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], 1845‚ÄìJanuary 17, 1893.
**Served as the seat of the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]] after the [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]], January 17, 1893 ‚Äì July 4, 1894.
**Served as the capital of the [[Republic of Hawaii]] when it was established on July 4, 1894 until the Republic was annexed by the United States on July 7, 1898 under the [[Newlands Resolution]] to become the [[Territory of Hawaii]]. On becoming a state in 1959, Honolulu became the capital of the [[Hawaii|State of Hawaii]].

===Republic of Texas===
Before joining the United States under the [[Texas Annexation]] in 1845, Texas was an independent nation known as the [[Republic of Texas]]. Seven cities served as its capital:
*[[Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas|Washington]] (now Washington-on-the-Brazos), 1836
*[[Harrisburg, Houston|Harrisburg]] (now part of Houston), 1836
*[[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], 1836
*[[Velasco, Texas|Velasco]], 1836
*[[West Columbia, Texas|West Columbia]], 1836
*[[Houston]], 1837‚Äì1839
*[[Austin, Texas|Austin]], 1839‚Äì1845 (also present-day capital of the [[Texas|State of Texas]])

== Native American capitals ==
Some Native American tribes, in particular the [[Five Civilized Tribes]], organized their states with constitutions and capitals in Western style. Others, like the Iroquois, had long-standing, pre-Columbian traditions of a 'capitol' longhouse where wampum and council fires were maintained with special status. Since they did business with the U.S. Federal Government, these capitals can be seen as officially recognized in some sense.

=== Cherokee Nation ===
* [[New Echota]] 1825‚Äì1832
New Echota, now near [[Calhoun, Georgia|Calhoun]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] was founded in 1825, realizing the dream and plans of Cherokee Chief [[Major Ridge]]. Major Ridge chose the site because of its centrality in [[Cherokee Nation (1794‚Äì1907)|the historic Cherokee Nation]] which spanned parts of Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama, and because it was near the confluence of the [[Conasauga River|Conasauga]] and [[Coosawattee River|Coosawattee]] rivers. The town's layout was partly inspired by Ridge's many visits to Washington D.C. and to Baltimore, but also invoked traditional themes of the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex|Southeastern ceremonial complex]]. Complete with the Council House, Supreme Court, [[Cherokee syllabary]] printing press, and the houses of several of the Nation's constitutional officers, New Echota served as the capital until 1832 when the state of Georgia outlawed Native American assembly in an attempt to undermine the Nation. Thousands of Cherokee would gather in New Echota for the annual National Councils, camping along the nearby rivers and holding long [[stomp dance]]s in the park-like woods that were typical of many Southeastern Native American settlements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* [[Red Clay State Park|Red Clay]] 1832‚Äì1838
The Cherokee National council grounds were moved to Red Clay, Tennessee on the Georgia state line in order to evade the Georgia state militia. The log cabins, limestone springs and park-like woods of Red Clay served as the capital until the Cherokee Nation was removed to [[Indian Territory]] ([[Oklahoma]]) on the [[Trail of Tears]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trail of Tears: The Rise and Fall of the Cherokee Nation|last=Ehle|first=John|publisher=Anchor Books Doubleday|year=1988|isbn=0385239548|location=New York|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma|Tahlequah]] 1839‚Äì1907, 1938‚Äìpresent
Tahlequah, in present-day Oklahoma, served as the capital of [[Cherokee Nation (1794‚Äì1907)|the original Cherokee Nation]] after [[Indian removal|Removal]]. After the Civil War, a turbulent period for the Nation which was involved in its own civil war resulting from pervasive anger and disagreements over removal from Georgia, the Cherokee Nation built a new [[Cherokee National Capitol|National Capitol]] in Tahlequah out of brick. The building served as the capitol until 1907, when the [[Dawes Act]] finally dissolved the Cherokee Nation and Tahlequah became the county seat of [[Cherokee County, Oklahoma]]. The Cherokee National government was re-established in 1938 and Tahlequah remains the capital of the modern [[Cherokee Nation]]; it is also the capital of the [[United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians]].
* [[Cherokee, North Carolina|Cherokee]] 20th century‚Äìpresent ([[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians|Eastern Band of Cherokee]])
Approximately four to eight hundred Cherokees escaped removal because they lived on a separated tract, purchased later with the help of Confederate Colonel [[William Holland Thomas]], along the Oconaluftee river deep in the Smoky Mountains of North Carolina. Some Cherokees fleeing the Federal Army sent for the "round up," fled to the remote settlements separated from the rest of the Cherokee Territory in Georgia and North Carolina in order to remain in their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncpedia.org/qualla-boundary|title=Qualla Boundary {{!}} NCpedia|website=www.ncpedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, their descendants organized as the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]]; its capital is at [[Cherokee, North Carolina]], in the tribally-controlled [[Qualla Boundary]].

=== Muscogee Creek Nation ===
* Hot Springs, Arkansas c. 1837‚Äì1866
After Removal from their Alabama-Georgia homeland, the Creek national government met near Hot Springs which was then part of their new territory as prescribed in the Treaty of Cusseta. However, the Union forced the [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation|Creeks]] to cede over three million acres (half of their land) of what is now Arkansas, after some Creeks fought with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcn-nsn.gov/culturehistory/|title=Muscogee Creek Nation -Culture/history|last=|first=|date=|website=Muscogee Creek Nation|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma|Okmulgee]] 1867‚Äì1906
Served as the National capital after the American Civil War. It was probably named after [[Ocmulgee National Monument|Ocmulgee]], on the [[Ocmulgee River|Ocmulgee river]] in [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], a principle [[Coosa chiefdom|Coosa]] and later [[Muscogee|Creek]] town built with mounds and functioning as part of the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex|Southeastern ceremonial complex]]. However, there were other traditional Creek "mother-towns" before removal. The Ocmulgee mounds were ceded illegally in 1821 with the [[Treaty of Indian Springs (1821)|Treaty of Indian Springs]].

=== Iroquois Confederacy ===
* [[Onondaga Reservation|Onondaga]] (Onondaga privilege c. 1450‚Äìpresent)
The [[Iroquois|Iroquois Confederacy]] or '''Haudenosaunee''', which means "People of the Longhouse," was an alliance between the Five and later Six-Nations of Iroquoian language and culture of upstate [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=nysmuseum|title=Haudenosaunee or Iroquois?|date=2014-09-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSXL33JiKLY|accessdate=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the [[Seneca people|Seneca]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], [[Oneida people|Oneida]], [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], and, after 1722, the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] Nations. Since the Confederacy's formation around 1450, the Onondaga Nation has held privilege of hosting the Iroquois Grand Council and the status of Keepers of the Fire and the Wampum ‚Äîwhich they still do at the official Longhouse on the Onondaga Reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haudenosauneeconfederacy.com/onondaga.html|title=Haudenosaunee Confederacy|website=www.haudenosauneeconfederacy.com|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now spread over reservations in New York and [[Ontario]], the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee preserve this arrangement to this day in what they claim to be the "world's oldest representative democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haudenosauneeconfederacy.com/grandcouncil.html|title=Haudenosaunee Confederacy|website=www.haudenosauneeconfederacy.com|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Seneca Nation of Indians ====
* [[Jimerson Town, New York|Jimerson Town]] ([[Allegany Indian Reservation|Allegany Reservation]])
* [[Irving, New York|Irving]] ([[Cattaraugus Indian Reservation|Cattaraugus Reservation]])

The [[Seneca Nation of Indians|Seneca Nation]] republic was founded in 1848 and has two capitals that rotate responsibilities every two years. Jimerson Town was founded in the 1960s following the formation of the [[Allegheny Reservoir]]. The Senecas also have an administrative longhouse in [[Steamburg, New York|Steamburg]] but do not consider that location to be a capital.

===Navajo Nation===
* [[Window Rock, Arizona|Window Rock]]
[[Window Rock]] ([[Navajo language|Navajo]]: ''Ts√©gh√°hoodz√°n√≠''), Arizona, is a small city that serves as the seat of government and capital of the [[Navajo Nation]] (1936‚Äìpresent), the largest territory of a sovereign Native American nation in North America. It lies within the boundaries of the St. Michaels Chapter, adjacent to the Arizona and New Mexico state line. Window Rock hosts the Navajo Nation governmental campus which contains the Navajo Nation Council, Navajo Nation Supreme Court, the offices of the Navajo Nation President and Vice President, and many Navajo government buildings.

==Unrecognized national capitals==
There have been a handful of nations within the current borders of the United States which were never officially recognized as legally independent sovereign entities; however, these nations did have ''[[de facto]]'' control over their respective regions during their existence.

===Vermont Republic===
Before joining the United States as the fourteenth state, Vermont was an independent republic known as the [[Vermont Republic]]. Two cities served as the capital of the Republic:
*[[Westminster (town), Vermont|Westminster]], 1777
*[[Windsor, Vermont|Windsor]], 1777‚Äì1791

The current capital of the [[Vermont|State of Vermont]] is [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]].

===State of Franklin===
The [[State of Franklin]] was an autonomous, secessionist United States territory created, not long after the end of the American Revolution, from territory that later was ceded by North Carolina to the federal government. Franklin's territory later became part of the state of Tennessee. Franklin was never officially admitted into the Union of the United States and existed for only four years.
*[[Jonesborough, Tennessee]], 1784‚Äì?
*[[Greeneville, Tennessee]], 1785?‚Äì?

===State of Muskogee===
The [[State of Muskogee]] was a short-lived [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] state in Florida, created by the Englishman [[William Augustus Bowles]], who was its "Director General", author of its Constitution and designer of its flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landers|first1=Jane|title=Atlantic Creoles in the Age of Revolutions|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=London|page=102-103}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of several tribes of [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creeks]] and [[Seminole]]s. It existed from 1799 to 1803. It had one capital:
*[[Miccosukee, Florida|Miccosukee]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dhr.dos.state.fl.us/facts/symbols/flag.cfm?page=2&amp;id=19 The State of Muskogee], State Flags of Florida, Cultural, Historical and Information Programs, [http://dhr.dos.state.fl.us/ Office of Cultural and Historical Programs website], [[Florida Department of State]], [[Government of Florida]], retrieved October 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 1799‚Äì1803

===Republic of West Florida===
The [[Republic of West Florida]] was a short-lived republic involving the area known today as [[Louisiana]]'s [[Florida Parishes]] &amp;mdash; at the time the westernmost portion of [[Spanish West Florida]]. The area was soon seized by the [[United States]] under President [[James Madison]] and incorporated into the [[Territory of Orleans]]. None of the Republic of West Florida was within the boundaries of modern Florida.
*[[St. Francisville, Louisiana]], 1810

===Republic of Indian Stream===
The [[Republic of Indian Stream]] was an unrecognized independent nation within the present state of [[New Hampshire]].
*[[Pittsburg, New Hampshire]], 1832‚Äì1835

===California Republic===
Before being annexed by the United States in 1848 (following the [[Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War]]), a small portion of north-central California declared itself the [[California Republic]], in an act of independence from Mexico, in 1846 (see [[Bear Flag Revolt]]).  The republic only existed a month before it disbanded itself, to join the advancing American army and therefore became part of the United States.

The very short-lived California Republic was never recognized by the United States, Mexico or any other nation.  There was one ''[[de facto]]'' capital of the California Republic:
*[[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]], 1846

===Confederate States===
The [[Confederate States of America]] (C.S.A.) had two capitals during its existence. The first capital was established February 4, 1861, in [[History of Montgomery, Alabama#Montgomery in the Civil War|Montgomery]], Alabama, and remained there until it was moved to [[Richmond in the American Civil War|Richmond]], Virginia, on May 29, 1861, after Virginia seceded on May 23.

The individual state capitals remained the same in the Confederacy as they had been in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] (U.S.A.), although as the advancing [[Union Army]] used those cities for military districts, some of the Confederate governments were relocated or moved out of state, traveling along with [[Confederate States Army|secessionist armies]].

* [[History of Montgomery, Alabama#Montgomery in the Civil War|Montgomery]], February 4, 1861 ‚Äì May 29, 1861
* [[Richmond in the American Civil War|Richmond]], May 29, 1861 ‚Äì April 3, 1865

==Historical state, colonial, and territorial capitals==
Most of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] had their capitals occupied or attacked by the British during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  State governments operated where and as they could.  The [[New York City|City of New York]] was occupied by [[British Armed Forces|British troops]] from 1776 to 1783.  A similar situation occurred during the [[War of 1812]], during the [[American Civil War]] in many [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]], and during the [[Pueblo Revolt]] of 1680&amp;ndash;1692 in [[New Mexico]].

Twenty-two state capitals have been a capital longer than their state has been a state, since they served as the capital of a predecessor territory, colony, or republic. [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], has been a capital city since 1630; it is the oldest continuously-running capital in the United States. [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], is the oldest capital city, having become capital in 1610 and interrupted only by the aforementioned Pueblo Revolt. An even older [[New Spain|Spanish]] city, [[St. Augustine, Florida]], served as a colonial capital from 1565 until about 1820, more than 250 years.

The table below includes the following information:
#The state, the year in which statehood was granted, and the state's capital are shown in '''bold''' type.  NOTE: For the first thirteen states, formerly the [[Thirteen Colonies]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] on the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic seaboard]], the year of statehood is shown as 1776 ([[United States Declaration of Independence]]) rather than the subsequent year each state ratified the 1787 [[United States Constitution]]. (See [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union]].) 
#The year listed for each capital is the starting date; the ending date is the starting date for the successor unless otherwise indicated.
#In many cases, capital cities of historical jurisdictions were outside of a state's present borders. (Those cities are generally indicated with the [[List of U.S. state abbreviations|two-letter abbreviation]] for the [[U.S. state]] in which the former administrative capital is now located.)

|[[Arkansas Post]]||1819||rowspan=2|Capitals of the [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansaw Territory]].&lt;ref name=Arkansas&gt;The name [[Arkansas]] has been pronounced and spelled in a variety of fashions.  The region was organized as the [[Territory of Arkansaw]] on July 4, 1819, but the territory was admitted to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[Arkansas|State of Arkansas]] on June 15, 1836.  The name was historically pronounced {{IPAc-en|Àà|…ër|k|…ô|n|s|…îÀê}}, {{IPAc-en|…ër|Àà|k|√¶|n|z|…ô|s}}, and several other variants.  In 1881, the [[Arkansas General Assembly]] passed the following concurrent resolution (Arkansas Statutes, Title 1, Chapter 4, Section 105):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the Native Americans and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final "s" silent, the "a" in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of "a" in "man" and the sounding of the terminal "s" is an innovation to be discouraged.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Citizens of the [[Kansas|State of Kansas]] often pronounce the [[Arkansas River]] {{IPAc-en|…ër|Àà|k|√¶|n|z|…ô|s}} in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''list of lights''' is a publication describing [[lighthouse]]s and other aids to maritime [[navigation]]. Most such lists are published by national [[hydrographic office]]s.

==United States==
The United States [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] publishes a list of lights.  The book is usually referred to as the ''List of Lights'', and should not be confused with the [[U.S. Coast Guard]]'s ''[[Light List]]''.

The ''List of Lights'' is published in seven volumes, as Publication numbers 110 through 116. Each volume contains lights and other aids to navigation that are maintained by or under the authority of other governments.

Each volume corresponds to a defined geographic region, and contains more complete information about the navigational aids than can be conveniently shown on nautical charts. New editions are published annually for every volume.

In addition to information on lighted aids to navigation and sound signals in foreign waters, the NGA ''List of Lights'' provides information on storm signals, signal stations, [[racon]]s, [[radiobeacon]]s, and [[radio direction finder]] calibration stations located at or near lights. Publication number 117, [[Radio Navigational Aids]], is the primary source for details on radio navigational aids.

The ''List of Lights'' does not include information on lighted buoys inside harbors. It does include certain aeronautical lights situated near the coast; however, these lights are not designed for marine navigation and are subject
to unreported changes.

[[Notice to Mariners|Notices to mariners]] provided by other countries are the main source for correctional information source for the ''Lists of Lights'', however other sources, such as ship reports, are also used.

Similar publications are published by the U.S. Coast Guard for U.S. civilian and commercial use, and by the Canadian Coast Guard.

'''Lloviznando Cantos''' is a [[Venezuela]]-based artists collective founded in 2001. The collective is a contemporary heir to the historical traditions of the [[Nueva Canci√≥n]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Their stated reason for being is to consolidate and bring to the masses political and social message of solidarity as conceived in the "socialist revolution" promoted by former Venezuelan president [[Hugo Rafael Ch√°vez Fr√≠as]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lloviznando Cantos: ‚ÄúSomos un movimiento que enfrenta con poes√≠a a los detractores de la revoluci√≥n‚Äù|url=http://www.noticias24.com/venezuela/noticia/131533/la-agrupacion-lloviznando-cantos-habla-sobre-su-trabajo-durante-la-campana-presidencial/|website=noticias24.com|publisher=noticias24.com|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collective has played in places such as Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Ecuador, Panama, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, as well as in Europe. 

As heirs of the Nueva Canci√≥n movement, they are performing what they call the "Canci√≥n Socialista" (Socialist Song).

Hintze is credited by veteran economic commentator and journalist [[Alex Brummer]] with warning about the state of [[UK banking]], the outlook for the [[UK housing market]], and the scale of [[toxic-debt]] on the balance sheets of UK banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2025039/ALEX-BRUMMER-Euro-banks-facing-crunch.html |work=[[This is Money]]/[[Daily Mail]]|date=11 August 2011 |author=Brummer, Alex |author-link=Alex Brummer |title=Euro banks facing a crunch |accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Professional Appointments===
Due to his expertise in global financial markets, Hintze has been tapped to sit on a number of boards and government panels.

In 2007, Hintze established MH Premium Farms (MHPF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mhpremiumfarms.com/|website=MH Premium Farms|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a group of agriculture companies based mainly in Australia.

The properties offer a broad portfolio including: fat lambs, wool and cattle; broad acre cropping of cereals and oilseeds; irrigated cotton and sugar.

MHPF is managed by a team of agricultural specialists, led by CEO Richard Taylor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Team: Richard Taylor|url=http://mhpremiumfarms.com/team-view/richard-taylor/|website=MH Premium Farms|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who graduated from Sydney University with a 1st class honours degree in Veterinary Science in 1987 and has since managed a number of agricultural companies in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prime Movers: Growth Farm founders Richard and Angus Taylor see positive future|url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/agribusiness/on-farm/prime-movers-growth-farm-founders-richard-and-angus-taylor-see-positive-future/news-story/68a9b90369170d4ae65e067fab2e2a5a|accessdate=27 July 2017|publisher=The Weekly Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:Neue Rheinische Zeitung N.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|The 19 June 1848 edition of ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung.'']]
The '''''Neue Rheinische Zeitung: Organ der Demokratie''''' ("New Rhenish Newspaper: Organ of Democracy") was a [[Germany|German]] daily [[newspaper]], published by [[Karl Marx]] in [[Cologne]] between 1 June 1848 and 19 May 1849. It is recognised by historians as one of the most important dailies of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolutions of 1848 in Germany]]. The paper was regarded by its editors and readers as the successor of an earlier Cologne newspaper, the ''[[Rheinische Zeitung]]'' ("Rhenish Newspaper"), also edited for a time by Karl Marx, which had been [[freedom of the press|suppressed]] by [[political censorship|state censorship]] over five years earlier.

== Publication history ==
===Establishment===

The ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung: Organ der Demokratie'' ("New Rhenish Newspaper: Organ of Democracy") was founded 1 June 1848 in Cologne (K√∂ln), part of [[Rhineland]]. The paper was established by Karl Marx, [[Frederick Engels]], as well as leading members of the [[Communist League]] living in Cologne immediately upon the return of Marx and Engels to Germany following the outbreak of the 1848 Revolution.&lt;ref name=Draper&gt;Hal Draper, "Neue Rheinische Zeitung: Organ der Demokratie," in ''The Marx-Engels Glossary: Glossary to the Chronicle and Register, and Index to the Glossary: Volume 3 of the Marx-Engels Cyclopedia.'' New York: Schocken Books, 1986; pp. 150-151.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper's editorial staff included [[Joseph Weydemeyer]], with Marx serving as editor-in-chief.

The paper was named after an earlier newspaper edited by Karl Marx in Cologne from 1842 to 1843, the ''Rheinische Zeitung.''&lt;ref name=Draper /&gt; The paper had the subtitle "Organ of Democracy," referring not to the establishment of [[liberal democracy|parliamentary]] democracy, but to the revolutionary "Democratic front" which included the progressive [[petty bourgeoisie]], the [[working class]], and the [[peasantry]].&lt;ref name=Draper /&gt;

The paper was financed through the sale of shares of stock, contributions and loans, and paid advertising.&lt;ref name=Draper /&gt; The paper was produced as a 4-page [[broadsheet]], with the use of occasional special supplements.&lt;ref name=Draper /&gt;

===Development===

Circulation of the paper ranged from 3,000 to 6,000 copies per issue,&lt;ref name=Chastain&gt;James G. Chastain, [http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/ip/nrz.htm "Neue Rheinische Zeitung,"] ''Encyclopedia of 1848 Revolutions,'' www.ohio.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; a number far in excess of the membership of the Communist League itself, which specialists estimate had between 200 and 300 participants.&lt;ref&gt;Tatyana Vasilyeva, "Preface" to Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, ''Collected Works: Volume 7: Marx and Engels, 1848.'' New York: International Publishers, 1977; pg. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively rendered the publication into what historian Tatyana Vasilyeva has called "the leading centre of the Communist League, directing the political activity of its members throughout Germany during the revolutionary period."&lt;ref&gt;Vasilyeva, "Preface" to ''Marx-Engels Collected Works: Vol. 7,'' pg. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 301 editions of the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' (NRZ) were produced during the course of its existence.&lt;ref name=Draper /&gt; To these Marx himself contributed a total of not fewer than 80 articles over the course of its existence.&lt;ref&gt;David McLellan, ''The Thought of Karl Marx: An Introduction.'' New York: Harper and Row, 1971; pg. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Since editorial contributions to the NRZ were unsigned and handwritten manuscripts have not survived, a precise count is impossible, however.&lt;ref&gt;Vasilyeva, "Preface" to ''Marx-Engels Collected Works: Vol. 7,'' pp. xxxii-xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political line===

The ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' (NRZ) was outspoken in its criticism of [[Prussia]] and [[Austria]] for [[Monarchism|Monarchist]] counter-revolution, and actively agitated for their defeat.&lt;ref name=Chastain /&gt; The paper was also critical of the willingness of the [[liberalism|liberal]] [[bourgeoisie]] to compromise with Monarchist forces ‚Äî policies which Marx and his comrades believed would have negative impacts upon the German revolution.&lt;ref name=Chastain /&gt;

More than three decades after the publication's termination, Marx's close associate [[Frederick Engels]] recalled that the NRZ had a political program with two main points: "a single, indivisible, democratic German republic, and War with [[Russian empire|Russia]], including the restoration of [[Poland]]."&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Engels, "Marx and the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' (1848-49)," ''Der Sozialdemokrat,'' No. 11 (March 13, 1884), reprinted in ''Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 26: Frederick Engels, 1882-89.'' New York: International Publishers, 1990; pp. 123-124.&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to foreign affairs, Engels recalled that the NRZ sought "to support every revolutionary people and to call for a general war of revolutionary Europe against the mighty bulwark of European reaction ‚Äî Russia."&lt;ref&gt;Engels, "Marx and the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' (1848-49)," pg. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

This policy was intended to undermine both the authority of Prussia and Tsarist Russia, both considered reactionary and militaristic powers, with war against Russia seen as a necessary prerequisite for establishment of a unified and democratic Germany.&lt;ref name=Engels124&gt;Engels, "Marx and the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' (1848-49)," pg. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx and Engels believed that "if Germany could be successfully brought to make war against Russia, it would be the end for the [[Hapsburg dynasty|Habsburgs]] and [[Hohenzollern dynasty|Hohenzollerns]] and the revolution would triumph along the whole line."&lt;ref&gt;Engels, "Marx and the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' (1848-49)," pg. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tone of the newspaper was described by Engels as "by no means solemn, serious, or enthusiastic," instead treating political opponents with "mockery and derision" in a manner entertaining to readers.&lt;ref name=Engels124 /&gt; The paper sought to foster the idea that the German events of the spring of 1848 were the starting point of a long revolutionary process akin to the [[French Revolution]] of 1789-1794.&lt;ref name=Engels125&gt;Engels, "Marx and the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' (1848-49)," pg. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper attempted to undermine the notion that the formal resolutions of various "National Assemblies" were capable of changing state policy in any fundamental way.&lt;ref name=Engels125 /&gt;

Throughout its existence the NRZ was persecuted by the Prussian government, which brought lawsuits against it charging the NRZ with having "slandered" government officials.&lt;ref name=Draper /&gt; As the revolutionary upsurge of 1848 ebbed, the government's hindrance of the publication became steadily more effective, culminating in Karl Marx's expulsion from Germany ‚Äî a move which effectively killed the paper.&lt;ref name=Draper /&gt;

===Suppression===

On 2 March 1849, Prussian soldiers came to Marx's home to arrest one of the writers. Marx refused to turn over the writer, and the soldiers eventually left.  

On 16 May 1849 Marx received an official note from the royal government declaring:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The tendency of the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' to provoke in its readers contempt for the present government, and incite them to violent revolution and the setting up of a social republic has become stronger in its latest pieces.... The right of hospitality which he has so disgracefully abused is therefore to be withdrawn from its editor-in-chief, Dr. Karl Marx, and since he has not obtained permission to prolong his stay in these states, he is ordered to leave them within 24 hours. If he should not comply voluntarily with this demand, he is to be forcibly conveyed across the frontier."&lt;ref&gt;First published in ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung,'' No. 301, 19 May 1849. Reprinted as "The Summary Suppression of the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung,"'' ''Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 9.'' New York: International Publishers, 1977; pg. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This expulsion order, combined with the growing threat of arrest or exile of its writers forced the NRZ to publish its last issue on 19 May 1849, known as the "red issue" as it was printed entirely in red ink. Marx closed with a sharp rebuttal against the suppression of the NRZ:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Why these absurd phrases, these official lies? The trend and tone of the latest pieces of the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' do not differ a whit from its first 'sample piece.' *  *  *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"And the 'social republic'? Have we proclaimed it only in the 'latest pieces' of the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung?'' Did we not speak plainly and clearly enough for these dullards who failed to see the 'red' thread running through all our comments and reports on the European movement? *  *  *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"We have no compassion and we ask no compassion from you. When our turn comes, we shall not make excuses for the terror. But the royal terrorists, the terrorists by the grace of God and the law, are in practice brutal, disdainful, and mean, in theory cowardly, secretive, and deceitful, and in both respects disreputable."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "The Summary Suppression of the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung,"'' ''Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 9.'' New York: International Publishers, 1977; pp. 451-453.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Legacy===

In January 1850 Marx launched a new publication, a monthly magazine called ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung: Politsch-√∂konomische Revue]]'' ("New Rhenish Newspaper: Politico-Economic Review").&lt;ref name=Draper /&gt; Edited in [[London]] and printed in [[Hamburg]], the periodical managed only six issues before folding.&lt;ref&gt;Hal Draper, "Neue Rheinische Zeitung: Politsch-√∂konomische Revue," in ''The Marx-Engels Glossary: Glossary to the Chronicle and Register, and Index to the Glossary.'' New York: Schocken Books, 1986; pg. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-known content of the NRZ were a series of five articles on economics published by Marx in April 1849 ‚Äî a series unfinished due to the suppression of the paper.&lt;ref name=DraperWLC&gt;Hal Draper, ''The Marx-Engels Register: A Complete Bibliography of Marx and Engels' Individual Writings: Volume 2 of the Marx-Engels Cyclopedia.'' New York: Schocken Books, 1985; pg. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; First gathered under a single set of covers under the title ''[[Wage Labour and Capital|Wage-labor and Capital]]'' in 1880, this material was subsequently revised by Engels in 1891 and frequently reprinted thereafter as an accessible popularization of [[Marxist economics]].&lt;ref name=DraperWLC /&gt;

The great bulk of the journalism of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels in the NRZ became systematically accessible to an English readership only in 1977, with the publication of volumes 7, 8, and 9 of the ''[[Marx-Engels Collected Works]].'' It was then that a total of 357 of the 422 articles contained therein were published in English for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;For individual counts of first English publications see: Vasilyeva, "Preface" to ''Marx-Engels Collected Works: Vol. 7,'' pg. xxxii. Vladimir Sazonov, "Preface" to Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, ''Collected Works: Volume 8: Marx and Engels, 1848-1849.'' New York: International Publishers, 1977; pg. xxix. Velta Pospelova, "Preface" to Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, ''Collected Works: Volume 9: Marx and Engels, 1849.'' New York: International Publishers, 1977; pg. xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 an online newspaper calling itself ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' was established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrhz.de/ Neue Rheinische Zeitung (2005) website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Don't Shred On Me.png|thumb|Don't Shred On Me Logo created by Pat Ramseur for the Open Carry Guitar Rally held July 4, 2014 in Dallas, Texas]]

'''Open Carry Guitar Rally''' is a concept created by Barry Kooda in response to the [[Open Carry]] gun movement. During an Open Carry Guitar Rally, citizens congregate in a public place while displaying their instruments, a parody of similar gatherings held by [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]] activists.

==Background==
The event originated in [[Dallas, Texas]], where it received the support of the local Dallas art and music communities. Kooda is a member of the Dallas-based [[punk rock]] band [[The Nervebreakers]]. Since then, these rallies have occurred in several cities across the United States. These events are attended by people with varying degrees of opinions concerning gun rights and legislation; while some attendees express anti-gun sentiment, others view the gatherings simply as an opportunity to enjoy the camaraderie of fellow guitar enthusiasts.

The Open Carry Guitar Rally was organized using the [[open source]] concept. The idea, and all artwork and images are free for use for others to use to organize their own open carry guitar rallies, provided proper credit is given to the artists and contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Open Carry Guitar Rally |title=Info |url=http://opencarryguitarrally.com/info/ |accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Palatine Peasants' War''' ({{lang-de|pf√§lzische Bauernkrieg}}) was part of the general [[German Peasants' War]] on the Middle and Upper [[Rhine]]. The uprising in the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatine Electorate]] and its surrounding area took place in April to June 1525.

== History ==
The start of the German Peasants' War in West Rhenish Palatinate was marked by the gathering of a band of peasants, a so-called ''Haufe'', at [[Nu√üdorf (Landau)|Nu√üdorf]] near [[Landau in der Pfalz|Landau]] on 23 April 1525. The Palatine peasant mobs plundered several surrounding monasteries (including the [[Knights Hospitaller]] [[commandry]] of [[Heimbach]] near [[Zeiskam]] as well as [[H√∂rdt]], where the provost was killed) and castles, before they took [[Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe|Neustadt]] on 6 May without a fight. The peasants' programme was based on the [[Twelve Articles]], which were drawn up at [[Memmingen]] and of which 25,000 copies were printed. A second ''Haufe'' gathered near [[Bockenheim an der Weinstra√üe|Bockenheim]]. As a result, the Palatine [[prince-elector]], [[Louis V of the Palatinate|Louis V]] felt forced into negotiations with the Geilweiler and Bockenheim groups; these began on 10 May in [[Forst an der Weinstra√üe|Forst]]. The complaints were to be handled by a ''[[Landtag (historic)|Landtag]]''. The Elector finally resorted to military force against the peasants on 23 May with the support of troops from the Archbishop of [[Trier]], after other princes had defeated the uprisings in W√ºrttemberg and in the Alsace. The Palatine peasants mobs were crushingly defeated at the [[Battle of Pfeddersheim]] on 23/24 June. Eight thousand peasants were reported to have been killed in the battle.

The '''Parliamentary Labor Party''' (also known as the '''Premiers' Plan Labor Party''' or '''Ministerial Labor Party''') was a [[political party]] active in [[South Australia]] from August 1931 until June 1934.

The party came into existence as a result of intense dispute, especially within the [[Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch)|Australian Labor Party]], about the handling of the response to the [[Great Depression in Australia]]. In June 1931, a meeting of state premiers agreed on the [[Premiers' Plan]], which involved sweeping austerity measures combined with increases in revenue. When the Premiers' Plan came up for a vote in South Australia, 23 of Labor's 30 [[South Australian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] members and two of Labor's four [[South Australian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] members voted for it. In August 1931, the South Australian state conference of the Labor Party expelled all of the MPs who supported the Premiers' Plan, including Premier [[Lionel Hill]] and his entire Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article35678760 |title=Labor Party Expels Five M.P.'s |newspaper=[[Advertiser and Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=14 August 1931 |accessdate=26 December 2014 |page=21 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article133068424 |title=WHERE PREMIER WILL STAND. |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]] |location=Adelaide |date=6 January 1933 |accessdate=5 June 2015 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expelled MPs (23) in the [[South Australian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]]: 
*[[Frederick Birrell]]
*[[Alfred Blackwell]]
*[[Thomas Butterfield]]
*[[Clement Collins]]
*[[George Cooke (Australian politician)|George Cooke]]
*[[Jack Critchley]]
*[[Bill Denny (Australian politician)|Bill Denny]]

*[[Robert Richards (Australian politician)|Robert Richards]]
*[[Eric Shepherd]]
*[[Frank Staniford]]
*[[Albert Thompson (Australian politician)|Albert Thompson]]
*[[Walter Warne]]

Expelled MPs (2) in the [[Legislative Council]]: 
*[[James Jelley]]
*[[Stanley Whitford]]

Upon the failure of a November appeal to the federal executive of the Labor Party, the expelled MPs definitively constituted themselves as a separate parliamentary party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article90638215 |title=New State Labor Party? |newspaper=[[The Chronicle (Adelaide)|The Chronicle]] |location=Adelaide |date=26 November 1931 |accessdate=26 December 2014 |page=41 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having soundly lost its majority, the PLP ministry stayed in office until the [[South Australian state election, 1933|1933 election]] with the support of the conservative opposition--the [[Liberal Federation]] to 1932 and the [[Liberal and Country League]] afterward. Hill, facing increasing political challenges, had himself appointed Agent-General in London and abruptly quit politics in February 1932. [[Robert Richards (Australian politician)|Robert Richards]] briefly succeeded him as Premier, and led the party into the 1933 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hill-lionel-laughton-6671 | title=Hill, Lionel Naughton (1881‚Äì1963) | publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography | accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party, along with the official Labor Party and the rival splinter [[Lang Labor Party (South Australia)|Lang Labor Party]], performed poorly at the 1933 election. Of the 23 MPs the party had going into the election, only five ‚Äì Blackwell, McInnes, Pedler, and Richards in the House of Assembly, and Whitford in the Legislative Council, were reelected.  The three Labor factions won only 13 seats between them, against 29 for the LCL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article37700501 |title=Labour Defeated.

Two of the three Lang Labor Party MHAs elected at the [[South Australian state election, 1933|1933 state election]], [[Bob Dale (politician)|Bob Dale]] and [[Tom Howard (politician)|Tom Howard]], left the party in 1933 post-election after falling out with leader [[Doug Bardolph]] and formed their own party, the [[Lang Labor Party (South Australia)#South Australian Lang Labor Party (SALLP)|South Australian Lang Labor Party]] (SALLP).

The four Labor parties merged back into the official Labor Party in June 1934 under the leadership of [[Andrew Lacey]] of the official Labor faction, following a successful unity conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58850868 |title=Reunion in Ranks of Labor |newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail]] |location=Adelaide |date=23 June 1934 |accessdate=26 December 2014 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitford, the party's sole upper house member, had left the party to sit as an independent by the time of the conference, and was not re-admitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128435135 |title=Last Minute News. |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]] |location=Adelaide |date=15 June 1934 |accessdate=26 December 2014 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Peace Companies''' ({{lang-ar|ÿ≥ÿ±ÿßŸäÿß ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ}}, [[transliteration of Arabic|translit.]] ''SarƒÅyƒÅ al-SalƒÅm''), frequently mistranslated as '''Peace Brigades''' in US media, are an [[Iraq]]i armed group linked to Iraq's [[Shia]] community. They are a 2014 revival of the '''Mahdi Army''' (''JAM''; {{lang|ar|ÿ¨Ÿäÿ¥ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸáÿØŸä}} ''Jaish al-Mahdƒ´'')&lt;ref name="web.stanford.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/57|title=Mahdi Army|author=Daniel Cassman|publisher=|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraqinews.com/iraq-war/shia-peace-brigades-killed-30-isis-militants-says-aqili/|title=Shia paramilitary 'Peace Brigades' kill 30 ISIS fighters says Akili - Iraqi News|work=Iraq news, the latest Iraq news|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was created by the Iraqi Shia cleric [[Muqtada al-Sadr]] in June 2003 and disbanded in 2008.

The Mahdi Army rose to international prominence on April 18, 2004, when it spearheaded the first major armed confrontation against the [[History of Iraq (2003‚Äì2011)|US forces in Iraq]] from the Shia community. This concerned an uprising that followed the ban of al-Sadr's newspaper and his subsequent attempted arrest, lasting until a truce on June 6. The truce was followed by moves to disband the group and transform al-Sadr's movement into a political party to take part in the 2005 elections; Muqtada al-Sadr ordered fighters of the Mahdi army to cease fire unless attacked first. The truce broke down in August 2004 after provocative actions by the Mahdi Army, with new hostilities erupting. The group was disbanded in 2008, following a crackdown by Iraqi security forces.

At its height, the Mahdi Army's popularity was strong enough to influence local government, the police, and cooperation with Sunni Iraqis and their supporters. The group was popular among Iraqi police forces. The [[National Independent Cadres and Elites]] party that ran in the [[Iraqi legislative election, January 2005|2005 Iraqi election]] was closely linked with the army. Members of the Mahdi Army frequently carried out atrocities, particularly against Sunni civilians. The Mahdi Army were accused of operating [[death squads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iraqs-death-squads-on-the-brink-of-civil-war-467784.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430151426/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iraqs-death-squads-on-the-brink-of-civil-war-467784.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 April 2008|title=Iraq's death squads: On the brink of civil war|work=The Independent|accessdate=10 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2370161|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016185308/http://jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2370161|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 October 2006|title=Terrorism Monitor - The Jamestown Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was armed with various [[light weapons]], including [[improvised explosive devices]] (IEDs). Many of the IEDs used during attacks on Iraqi Security Forces and Coalition Forces used infra-red sensors as triggers, a technique that was used widely by the [[Provisional IRA|IRA]] in [[Northern Ireland]] in the early-to-mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/ulster/article320004.ece | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Revealed: IRA bombs killed eight British soldiers in Iraq | first1=Greg | last1=Harkin | first2=Francis | last2=Elliott | first3=Raymond | last3=Whitaker | date=October 16, 2005 | accessdate=May 12, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709005403/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/ulster/article320004.ece | archivedate=July 9, 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was re-mobilized in 2014 in order to fight against the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] and was still active as of 2016. It participated in the recapture of [[Jurf Al Nasr]] and the [[Second Battle of Tikrit (March‚ÄìApril 2015)|Second Battle of Tikrit]].

In the [[Twelver]] school of [[Shia Islam]], the Mahdƒ´ is believed to have been a historical figure identified with the [[Imam|Twelfth ImƒÅm]], [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Muhammad al-Mahdƒ´]], and is therefore called ''al-ImƒÅm al-Mahdƒ´''. It is believed that he is still present on earth "in occultation" (i.e., hidden), and will emerge again in the end times. Those Shi`ites of this school believe that the ImƒÅm Mahdƒ´ is the rightful ruler of the whole Islamic community (''[[ummah]]'') at any given time, and he is therefore also called ''ImƒÅm al-ZamƒÅn'', meaning "ImƒÅm of the Age/Time."

==History==

===Early history===
Created by [[Muqtada al-Sadr]] and a small faction of Shi'ites, the Mahdi Army began as a  group of roughly 500 [[seminary]] students connected with Muqtada al-Sadr in the [[Saddam City|Sadr City]] district of [[Baghdad]], formerly known as Saddam City. The group moved in to fill the security vacuum in Sadr City and in a string of southern Iraqi cities following the [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|fall of Baghdad]] to U.S-led coalition forces on April 9, 2003. The group was involved in dispensing aid to Iraqis and provided security in the Shi'ite [[slum]]s from looters.

Gradually, the militia grew and al-Sadr formalized it in June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/15/iraq.iran | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Mahdi army commanders withdraw to Iran to lie low during security crackdown | first=Michael | last=Howard | date=February 15, 2007 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahdi Army grew into a sizable force of up to 10,000 who even operated what amounted to a shadow government in some areas. Al-Sadr's preaching is critical of the US occupation, but he did not initially join the [[Sunni]] Islamist and Baathist [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] in their attacks on coalition forces.

===2004 Shi'ite Uprising===
{{main|Iraq spring fighting of 2004}}

====Uprising begins====
Sadr's position changed dramatically, however, by the beginning of April 2004. Following the closure of the Sadr-owned newspaper ''al-Hawza'' and the arrest of one of his senior aides, Sadr gave an unusually heated sermon to his followers on April 2. The next day, violent protests occurred throughout the Shi'ite south that soon spilled over into a violent uprising by Mahdi Army militiamen, fully underway by April 4.

====April hostilities====
The Mahdi Army forces began an offensive in [[Najaf]], [[Kufa]], [[Kut]], and Sadr City, seizing control of public buildings and police stations while clashing with coalition forces. The militants gained partial control of [[Karbala]] after fighting there. Other coalition forces came under attack in [[Nasiriyah]], [[Amarah]] and [[Basra]]. Najaf and Kufa were quickly seized after a few firefights with Spanish troops, and Kut was seized after clashes with Ukrainian troops soon afterwards.

After sporadic clashes, coalition forces temporarily suppressed most militia activity in Nasiriyah, Amarah, and Basra. Mahdi rebels expelled Iraqi police from three police stations and ambushed U.S. forces in Sadr City, killing seven U.S. troops and wounding several more. U.S. forces subsequently regained control of the police stations after running firefights with the fighters, killing dozens of Mahdi militiamen. However, Mahdi Army members still maintained some influence over many of the slum areas of Sadr City.

On April 16, Kut was retaken by US forces, and several dozen Mahdi Army members were killed in the battle. However, the area around Najaf and Kufa along with Karbala remained under the control of Sadr's forces. Sadr himself was believed to be in Najaf. Coalition troops cordoned off Najaf with 2,500 troops, but reduced the number of forces to pursue negotiations with the Mahdi Army. At the beginning of May, coalition forces estimated that there were 200‚Äì500 militants still present in Karbala, 300‚Äì400 in [[Diwaniyah]], an unknown number still left in Amarah and Basra, and 1,000‚Äì2,000 still in the Najaf-Kufa region.

On May 4, coalition forces began a counter-offensive to eliminate the Mahdi Army in southern Iraq following a breakdown in negotiations. The first wave began with simultaneous raids in Karbala and Diwaniyah on militia forces, followed by a second wave on May 5 in Karbala and more attacks that seized the governor's office in Najaf on May 6. 86 militiamen were estimated killed in the fighting along with 4 U.S. soldiers. Several high-ranking militia commanders were also killed in a separate raid by US [[Special Operations]] units. On May 8, U.S. forces launched a follow-up offensive into Karbala, launching a two-pronged attack into the city. U.S. tanks also launched an incursion into Sadr City. At the same time, perhaps as a diversionary tactic, hundreds of Mahdi Army members swept through Basra, firing on British patrols and seizing parts of the city. Two militants were killed and several British troops were wounded.

On May 24, after suffering heavy losses in weeks of fighting, Mahdi Army forces withdrew from the city of Karbala. This left the only area still under their firm control being the Najaf-Kufa region, also under sustained American assault. Several hundred Mahdi Army militia in total were killed.  Unfazed by the fighting, Muqtada al-Sadr regularly gave Friday sermons in Kufa throughout the uprising.

==== June truce ====
On June 6, 2004, Muqtada al-Sadr issued an announcement directing the Mahdi Army to cease operations in Najaf and Kufa. Remnants of the militia soon ceased bearing arms and halted the attacks on U.S. forces. Gradually, militiamen left the area or went back to their homes. On the same day, [[Brigadier General]] [[Mark Hertling]], a top US [[commander]] in charge of [[Najaf]], [[Iraq]], stated "The Muqtada militia is militarily defeated. We have killed scores of them over the last few weeks, and that is in Najaf alone. [...] The militia have been defeated, or have left."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080410051925/http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=43036&amp;archive=true]&lt;/ref&gt; June 6 effectively marked the end of Shi'ite uprising. The total number of Mahdi Army militiamen killed in the fighting across Iraq is estimated at between 1,500 and 2,000. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The return of Najaf to Iraqi security forces following the cease-fire left Sadr City as the last bastion of Mahdi Army guerrillas still pursuing violent resistance. Clashes continued periodically in the district following the end of the Najaf-Kufa battles. On June 24, Mahdi Army declared an end to operations in Sadr City as well, effectively ending militia activity, at least for the time being.

After the June 4 truce with the occupation forces, al-Sadr took steps to disband the Mahdi Army. In a statement, he called on militia members from outside Najaf to "do their duty" and go home. US forces in Najaf were then replaced by Iraqi police. Al-Sadr told supporters not to attack Iraqi security forces and announced his intention to form a party and enter the 2005 elections. He said the interim government was an opportunity to build a unified Iraq. Interim President [[Ghazi Yawer]] gave assurances that al-Sadr could join the political process provided he abandoned his militia. Iraqi officials also assured al-Sadr that he was not to face arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3811215.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Middle East - Sadr orders militia to quit Najaf|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== August hostilities ====
{{main|Battle of Najaf (2004)}}

After Sadr's militia besieged a police station in Najaf and the local governor called for assistance, the US military intervened again. US troops arrested Sadr's representative in Karbala, Sheikh Mithal al Hasnawi on  July 31&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/2004/593/593p15.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040819101827/http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/2004/593/593p15.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 August 2004|title=Back issues for 2004|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and surrounded al-Sadr's home on August 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3528992.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Middle East - Fighting flares around Sadr home|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2004/08/08/iraqi_bid_to_arrest_al_sadr_fails/|title=Iraqi bid to arrest al-Sadr fails|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/08/03/1359246|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040805005932/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04%2F08%2F03%2F1359246|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 August 2004|title=Headlines for August 03, 2004|work=Democracy Now!|accessdate=21 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1278178,00.html|title=US troops kill 300 in Najaf raid|author=Michael Howard|work=the Guardian|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; British troops in [[Basra]] also moved against al-Sadr followers, arresting four on August 3. After the expiration of a noon deadline to release them on August 5, the Basra militiamen declared [[Jihad|holy war]] on British forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/08/06/wirq06.xml|title=News|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 5, via his spokesman Ahmed al-Shaibany, al-Sadr re-affirmed his commitment to the truce and called on US forces to honour the truce. He announced that if the restoration of the cease-fire failed "then the firing and igniting of the revolution will continue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=902792004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040830123359/http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=902792004|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 August 2004|title=Clashes in holy city as truce plea ignored|date=6 August 2004|publisher=The Scotsman|accessdate=2 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offer was rejected by the governor of Najaf, [[Adnan al-Zurufi]] ("There is no compromise or room for another truce") and US officials ("This is one battle we really do feel we can win").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/08/07/wirq07.xml|title=News|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days that followed fighting continued around the old city of Najaf, in particular at the [[Imam Ali shrine]] and the cemetery. The Mahdi Army, estimated at 2,000 in Najaf, was outnumbered by some 2,000 US troops and 1,800 Iraqi security forces, and at a disadvantage due to the vastly superior American tactics, training, firepower and air power, such as helicopters and [[AC-130 gunship]]s. On August 13, the militia was trapped in a cordon around the Imam Ali shrine. While negotiations continued between the interim government and the Mahdi Army, news came that al-Sadr had been wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3560662.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Middle East - Radical cleric 'wounded' in Najaf|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 12, British journalist [[James Brandon (journalist)|James Brandon]], a reporter for the [[Sunday Telegraph]] was kidnapped in Basra by unidentified militants. A video tape was released, featuring Brandon and a hooded militant, threatening to kill the British hostage unless US forces withdrew from Najaf within 24 hours. In a feature, Brandon describes being beaten, pistol-whipped, and forced to participate in mock executions. He said he escaped after holding a woman at knife-point, to a government building where guards found him, but they phoned his kidnappers, who arrived to collect him. Despite telling them repeatedly that he was a journalist, they assumed he was a spy or agent for the [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003‚Äìpresent|occupation]] until they saw a report about the kidnap on [[al-Arabiya]] television. Afterward, Brandon's treatment improved markedly and he was released after less than a day, following intervention by al-Sadr. At a press conference, Brandon commented on his treatment and thanked his kidnappers: "Initially I was treated roughly, but once they knew I was a journalist I was treated very well and I want to say thank you to the people who kidnapped me." A spokesman for al-Sadr said: "We apologise for what happened to you. This is not our tradition, not our rules. It is not the tradition of Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3560892.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Middle East - UK journalist kidnapped in Basra|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3563032.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Kidnapped UK journalist released|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandon was delivered to the British military police who gave him medical treatment and escorted him to [[Kuwait]] the following day. Brandon planned to see his family and go on holiday, but said he wanted to return to Iraq : "Only next time, I just want to do the reporting. I have no desire to be the story again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3566348.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; 'Mock executions' for UK hostage |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-08-15 |accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that American troops surrounded the Shrine led to an impasse as the Mahdi army could not leave the shrine and US troops did not want to offend Islam by setting foot inside the shrine. The standoff did not end for three weeks until [[Ali al-Sistani|Sistani]] emerged from convalescence in London and brokered an agreement between the two forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/08/27/iraq.main/index.html|title=CNN.com - Al-SadrÁàâilitia swaps prisoners with Iraq - Aug 28, 2004|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iraqi reactions====
The uprising seemed to draw an ambivalent reaction from the Iraqi population, which for the most part neither joined nor resisted the rebels. Many Iraqi security forces melted away, wishing to avoid confrontation. In a sign of Mahdi Army's unpopularity in Najaf, however, which follows more traditionalist clerics, a small covert movement sprung up to launch attacks on the militants. The uprising did receive a good deal of support from Shiite radicals in Baghdad, however, who were galvanized by the simultaneous siege of the city of [[Fallujah]].

===2005===
{{Expand section|date=March 2008}}

Loyalists to al-Sadr ran under the [[National Independent Cadres and Elites]] banner in the [[Iraqi parliamentary election, January 2005|2005 Iraqi election]]. Though a number of the movements supporters felt that the election was invalid.  The party finished sixth overall in the election and was represented in the transitional legislature. Another twenty or so candidates aligned with al-Sadr ran for the [[United Iraqi Alliance]].

The movement is believed to have infiltrated the Iraqi police forces, and to have been involved in the [[Basra prison incident|September 2005 arrest]] of two British soldiers by Iraqi police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0921/p01s03-woiq.html|title=Sadr militia's new muscle in south|author=The Christian Science Monitor|work=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 2005, former Prime Minister [[Iyad Allawi]] was assaulted by a mob in Najaf, where the Mahdi Army is influential.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060114124157/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/12/04/iraq.main/ Ex-Iraqi leader claims assassination attempt | CNN.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== October 2006 battle ===
{{main|Battle of Amarah}}

In mid October, a roadside bomb killed Qassim al-Tamimi, the chief of investigations for the provincial police force and a member of the rival [[Badr Organization]]. Badr fighters blamed the Mahdi Army for the killing and in response to this, the police captured a brother of the suspected bomber, who was a member of the Mahdi Army. Fighting began on October 17, when 800 masked members of the Mahdi army stormed three police stations in [[Amarah]]. Several firefights occurred between the militia and police over the course of the next four days.

By the morning of October 20, 2006, local leaders and residents said that victorious Mahdi fighters were patrolling the city on foot and in commandeered police vehicles and were setting up roadblocks. Sheik al-Muhamadawi stated early October 20 that "there is no state in the city. Policemen do not have enough weapons and ammunition compared with the militia, which has all kinds of weapons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/20/world/middleeast/21iraqcnd.html?ex=1318996800&amp;en=a542d37a1dff56f9&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | title = Attack on Iraqi City Shows Militia's Power | publisher = New York Times| date = 2006-10-20 | accessdate = 2006-10-20 | first=Kirk | last=Semple}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 27 people were killed and 118 wounded in the clashes.

The Mahdi Army eventually withdrew from their positions in Amarah following negotiations between local tribal and political leaders and representatives from the [[Baghdad]] offices of Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki|Nuri Kamal al-Maliki]]. A battalion from the [[Iraqi Army]] sent from [[Basra]] then took control of the city.

The stunning and defiant display of militia strength underscored the weaknesses of the Iraqi security forces and the potency of the Mahdi Army, which had been able to operate virtually unchecked in [[Iraq]]. This caused many to accuse the Mahdi Army of starting the [[Civil war in Iraq (2006‚Äì07)|Civil War in Iraq]].

===August 2007 ‚Äì March 2008 ceasefire===
In August 2007, during [[Battle of Karbala (2007)|fighting]] between the Mahdi Army and Iraqi police in Karbala, [[Muqtada al-Sadr]] called for a ceasefire and urged Mahdi Army members to stop fighting. The cease-fire has been credited with helping to reduce violence in [[Iraq]] between the Mahdi Army and Iraqi Army since August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/08/28/iraq.main/index.html#cnnSTCText|title=Al-Sadr calls for calm after Shiite militias clash in Karbala, Baghdad|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid fears of the ending of the ceasefire in February 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/02/20/iraq.main/index.html?iref=newssearch|title=Iraqi militia to hear Saturday whether to resume fighting|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was extended for a further six months by al-Sadr on February 22, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/02/22/iraq.main/index.html|title=Al-Sadr extends Mehdi Army cease-fire|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===March 2008 Iraqi security forces crackdown===
{{main|Battle of Basra (2008)|Siege of Sadr City}}

On 25 March 2008, thousands of Iraqi troops carried out a military strike against the Mahdi Army in their stronghold of Basra. This operation, code named Operation Charge of the Knights, was the first of its kind since British troops withdrew from the city centre.

Clashes took place between security forces and the militants loyal to Muqtada al-Sadr after a dawn military offensive in the southern city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/25/iraq|title=Sadr urges 'civil revolt' as battles erupt in Basra|author=Matthew Weaver|work=the Guardian|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Al-Sadr's headquarters of Najaf, the cleric ordered the field commanders of his Mahdi Army militia to go to 'maximum alert' and prepare "to strike the occupiers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-03-25-4110462503_x.htm|title=Militiamen holding out in Basra fighting - USATODAY.com|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunmen also reportedly clashed with Iraqi police in the southern city of [[Kut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L25165911.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220131507/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L25165911.htm|archivedate=2009-02-20|title=Iraqi forces battle gunmen in oil city |author=Thomson Reuters Foundation|work=alertnet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mahdi Army launched a nationwide civil disobedience campaign across [[Iraq]] to protest raids and detentions against the Mahdi Army. The discord threatened to unravel al-Sadr's ceasefire, spark renewed sectarian violence, and prompt the [[United States]] to delay troop withdrawals. Violent rivalries among Shiites had been predicted by many observers ahead of the [[Iraqi governorate elections, 2008]], which were to be held by October 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/03/25/iraq.main/index.html|title=Peaceful Iraq protests spark clashes; 50 reported dead|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrently, on April 6, Iraqi and U.S. forces moved into the southern third of Sadr City to prevent rocket and mortar fire from the area against the [[Green Zone]]. U.S. engineers began construction of a concrete barrier along al-Quds Street to seal the southern third of the city off and allow reconstruction to take place. Over the next month, the Mahdi Army launched a number of attacks on the troops building the barrier, but sustained heavy losses. On May 11, al-Sadr concluded a cease-fire agreement with Iraqi security forces, ending the battle.  Mahdi Army losses were estimated at between 700 and 1,000 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Middle East Wars|author=Spencer Tucker|page=1060|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2010|isbn=9781851099481|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U05OvsOPeKMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disbandment and resurgence in 2014===
On August 28, 2008, al-Sadr ordered the Mahdi Army to suspend military activity indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S6oP3Y9ZM3sC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=Mahdi+Army+disbanded#v=onepage&amp;q=Mahdi%20Army%20disbanded&amp;f=false|title=Withdrawal from Iraq: Assessing the Readiness of Iraqi Security Forces|author1=Anthony Cordesman|author2=Adam Mausner|year=2009|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|isbn=9780892065530|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, however, al-Sadr created either two or three new organizations to take the place of the Mahdi Army: the [[Promised Day Brigades]], established in November 2008 as a militia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/249|title=Mapping Militant Organizations: Promised Day Brigades|date=27 August 2012|accessdate=19 October 2013|publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Muhamidoon, which focuses on social work and religious education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sadr's Path Could Determine How Iraq Turns|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/world/middleeast/sadrs-path-could-determine-how-iraq-turns.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|date=21 September 2011|accessdate=19 October 2013|author=Tim Arango}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2010 Associated Press report also mentioned a third wing, the Monaseroun, responsible for "the mobilization of supporters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/05/04/feared-shiite-mahdi-army-militia-led-hardline-cleric-reviving-post-election/|newspaper=Fox News|date=4 May 2010|title=Feared Shiite Mahdi Army militia led by hardline cleric reviving in post-election Iraq|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, rumors of a Mahdi Army resurgence have cropped up periodically.  In April 2010, after winning 40 of 325 seats in the [[Iraqi parliamentary election, 2010|2010 parliamentary elections]], Sadr called for its reestablishment.&lt;ref name="CTC"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Return of Moqtada al-Sadr and the Revival of the Mahdi Army|date=3 June 2010|accessdate=19 October 2013|url=http://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/the-return-of-moqtada-al-sadr-and-the-revival-of-the-mahdi-army|author=Babak Rahimi|publisher=Combating Terrorism Center |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226005826/http://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/the-return-of-moqtada-al-sadr-and-the-revival-of-the-mahdi-army |archivedate=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 al-Sadr called for the formation of "Peace Companies", often mistranslated "Peace Brigades",&lt;ref name="web.stanford.edu"/&gt; to protect Shia shrines from the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].&lt;ref name="nbcn_Anti"&gt;{{cite web | title = Anti-U.S. Cleric Muqtada al-Sadr Retakes Stage Amid Iraq Turmoil - NBC News | author = Cassandra Vinograd | work = NBC News | date = 23 June 2014 | accessdate = 1 August 2015 | url = http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/iraq-turmoil/anti-u-s-cleric-muqtada-al-sadr-retakes-stage-amid-n138406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2014, these Peace Companies marched in [[Sadr City]], a slum in Baghdad infamous for being the prime Mahdi Army center of operations during the Iraq War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/06/iraqi-shia-groups-rally-show-power-20146216504615669.html|title=Iraqi Shia groups rally in show of power|publisher=|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to guarding shrines, the Peace Companies participated in offensive operations such as the recapture of [[Jurf Al Nasr]] in October 2014.&lt;ref name="wash_Iraq"&gt;{{cite web | title = Iraqi Shiite cleric recalls militiamen from fight against Islamic State | author1 = Loveday Morris | author2 = Mustafa Salim | work = Washington Post | date = 17 February 2015 | accessdate = 1 August 2015 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iraqi-shiite-cleric-recalls-militiamen-from-fight-against-islamic-state/2015/02/17/9e85321a-b6bb-11e4-bc30-a4e75503948a_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suspended their activities temporarily in February 2015,&lt;ref name="wash_Iraq"/&gt; but were active in the [[Second Battle of Tikrit (March‚ÄìApril 2015)|Second Battle of Tikrit]] in March.&lt;ref name="glob_Iraq"&gt;{{cite web | title = Iraqi militia loyal to radical cleric al-Sadr joins fight for IS-held Tikrit | author = Staff | work = Global News | date = 15 March 2015 | accessdate = 1 August 2015 | url = http://globalnews.ca/news/1883845/iraqi-militia-loyal-to-radical-cleric-al-sadr-joins-fight-for-is-held-tikrit/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iran's influence==
Although Muqtada Al-Sadr has historically had close ties to Iran, he has generally opposed Iranian clerical and political influence in Iraq. Unlike the Al-Hakim family, of the Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council and many leaders of the Dawa party who fled to Iran following the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and remained there in exile until the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|American invasion in 2003]], Muqtada al-Sadr and his family remained in Iraq throughout Saddam's rule. The refusal to leave Iraq garnered the Sadr family much support during and after the collapse of Saddam's regime.  Early 2006, al-Sadr pledged military support to Iran and other neighboring Islamic countries if they were to be attacked by a foreign nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1137605892424&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Cleric says militia would defend Iran if attacked | Jerusalem Post]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, however, Al-Sadr has opposed the [[Dawa Party]], and In 2006 Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]] ordered a major offensive targeting the Mahdi Army in Basra.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/29/world/middleeast/29iraq.html?ex=1314504000&amp;en=de6a827d26b0fcd4&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss Radical Militia and Iraqi Army in Fierce Battle] 29 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2007 or 2008, Muqtada al-Sadr moved to Iran and spent several years studying Shia jurisprudence in [[Qom]] before returning to [[Najaf]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="CTC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/20111872647305497.html Al-Sadr calls on Iraqis 'to resist'].

==Activities==
As of August 2006, the Mahdi Army rarely challenged coalition troops on a wide scale.  Neither the coalition nor the Iraqi government made any move to arrest al-Sadr.  The Mahdi Army participated in battles against Sunni insurgents and operated its own justice system in the areas it controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/11/35b8bb23-2a15-4275-99ee-b368fde58b0a.html|title=Iraq: Al-Sadr Militia Taking Law Into Own Hands|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Economist magazine.

==Structure==
{{Expand section|date=March 2008}}

When reporting on an early October 2006 clash between the Mahdi Army and Coalition troops in [[Diwaniyah]], BBC news suggested that at the time, the Mahdi Army was not a homogeneous force, with local groups apparently acting on own initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4801705.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Middle East - Battle rages in Shia Iraqi town|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, a senior coalition intelligence official had remarked to reporters how there were political fractures within Al-Sadr's organization in protest of his relatively moderate political course of action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,,1883854,00.html|title=US: Iraq failing to tackle death squads|author=Peter Beaumont|work=the Guardian|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with one coalition intelligence official claiming that at least six major leaders no longer answer to al-Sadr and as many as a third of the army was now out of his direct control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/28/world/middleeast/28sadr.html?ex=1317096000&amp;en=5f9450eeea4966f8&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss Cleric Said to Lose Reins of Parts of Iraqi Militia | New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48354">[[File:Estimates of Peak World Oil Production.jpg|thumb|36 Estimates of the year of peak world oil production (US EIA)]]

[[Peak oil]] is the point at which oil production, sometimes including [[unconventional oil]] sources, hits its maximum. '''Predicting the timing of peak oil''' involves estimation of future production from existing oil fields as well as future discoveries. The most influential production model is [[Hubbert peak theory]], first proposed in the 1950s. The effect of peak oil on the world economy remains controversial.

==Present range of predictions==
There was  {{When|date=September 2018}} a consensus between industry leaders and analysts that world oil production would peak between 2010 and 2030, with a significant chance that the peak will occur before 2020. Dates after 2030 were considered implausible by some.&lt;ref name="madureira"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sorrell|first=Steve|author2=Miller, Richard |author3=Bentley, Roger |author4= Speirs, Jamie |title=Oil futures: A comparison of global supply forecasts|journal=Energy Policy|date=September 2010|volume=38|issue=9|pages=4990‚Äì5003|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2010.04.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determining a more specific range is difficult due to the lack of certainty over the actual size of world oil reserves.&lt;ref name="chapman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Ian|title=The end of Peak Oil?

On the other hand, the US Energy Information Administration projected in 2014 that world production of ‚Äútotal liquids,‚Äù which, in addition to liquid petroleum, includes biofuels, natural gas liquids, and oil sands, would increase at an average rate of about one percent per year through 2040 without peaking. OPEC countries are expected to increase oil production at a faster rate than non-OPEC countries.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/assumptions/pdf/international.pdf International energy module], Assumptions to the Annual Energy Outlook 2014, April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the large range offered by meta-studies, papers published since 2010 have been relatively pessimistic. A 2010 [[Kuwait University]] study predicted production would peak in 2014.&lt;ref name="pubs.acs.org"&gt;{{cite journal

==Past predictions==

===1880s-1940s===
[[File:Petroleum Consumption Enormous article in Tractor and Gas Engine Review vol 11 no 05 1918.png|thumb|"Petroleum consumption enormous", article in ''Tractor and Gas Engine Review'', 1918.]]

The idea that human use of petroleum faces [[sustainability]] limits attracted practical concern at least as early as the 1880s, as did the related idea that the timing of those limits depends on the extraction technology. The concept of exhausting a natural resource to a point of [[diminishing returns]] had some antecedent examples. During the same decades when the modern petroleum industry was launching, the New England whale oil industry [[whaling in the United States|had just experienced a peak and was grappling with decline]].

Economist and oil analyst [[Daniel Yergin]] notes that the first predictions of imminent oil peaks go back to the 1880s, when some American experts believed that exhaustion of the Pennsylvania oil fields would kill the US oil industry.  Another wave of peak predictions occurred after [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="There will be oil,"&gt;Daniel Yergin, [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111904060604576572552998674340?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424053111904060604576572552998674340.html ‚ÄúThere will be oil,‚Äù] Wall Street Journal, 17 Sept. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"... the peak of production will soon be passed, possibly within 3 years. ... There are many well-informed geologists and engineers who believe that the peak in the production of natural petroleum in this country will be reached by 1921 and who present impressive evidence that it may come even before 1920."
::- David White, chief geologist, United States Geological Survey (1919)&lt;ref&gt;David White, "The unmined supply of petroleum in the United States," ''Transactions of the Society of Automotive Engineers'', 1919, v.14, part 1, p.227.&lt;/ref&gt;

:‚ÄúThe average middle-aged man of today will live to see the virtual exhaustion of the world‚Äôs supply of oil from wells,‚Äù 
::- Victor C. Anderson, president of the [[Colorado School of Mines]] (1921)&lt;ref&gt;‚ÄúThe present status of the oil shale industry" 1921, ''Colorado School of Mines Quarterly'', Apr. 1921, v.16 n.2 p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

A correspondent named W.D. Hornaday, quoting oil industry executive [[Joseph S. Cullinan|J.S. Cullinan]], described the concerns in a 1918 article for ''Tractor and Gas Engine Review'' titled "Petroleum consumption enormous."&lt;ref name="Hornaday_1918-05"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hornaday |first=W.D. |date=May 1918 |title=Petroleum consumption enormous |journal=Tractor and Gas Engine Review |volume=11 |issue=5 |page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6DmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article said, "There has been considerable discussion of late as to the possible length of time that the petroleum supply of the United States and the world will hold out."&lt;ref name="Hornaday_1918-05"/&gt; The article quoted Cullinan as saying, "It is just possible, so far as the United States is concerned, that the development and the exhaustion of the supplies may occur within the course of one human life. It is certain that unless radical changes from present methods are applied promptly, all sources of supply within the range of known drilling methods will be exhausted during the life of your children and mine."&lt;ref name="Hornaday_1918-05"/&gt; It turned out that radical changes from 1910s drilling methods were, in fact, applied promptly, and thus, the predicted timeframe was premature; but the underlying concerns (that the vastness of consumption would lead to shortages soon enough to worry about, regardless of the exact decade) did not disappear.

===Hubbert's model===
[[File:Hubbert peak oil plot.svg|thumb|A [[logistic distribution]] shaped world oil production curve, peaking at 12.5 billion barrels per year about the year 2000, as originally proposed by [[M. King Hubbert]] in 1956]]
In 1956, [[M. King Hubbert]] created and first used the models behind peak oil to predict that United States oil production would peak between 1965 and 1971.&lt;ref name=mkinghubbert1956&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |title=Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels 'Drilling and Production Practice' |last=Hubbert |first=Marion King |authorlink=M. King Hubbert |conference=Spring Meeting of the Southern District. Division of Production. [[American Petroleum Institute]] |publisher=[[Shell Oil Company|Shell Development Company]] |location=[[San Antonio]], [[Texas]] |pages=22‚Äì27 &lt;!-- p. 31-36 in pdf scheme --&gt; |date=June 1956 |accessdate=18 April 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233843/http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |archivedate=27 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Hubbert calculated that the world held an ultimate cumulative of 1.25 trillion barrels, of which 124 billion had already been produced. He projected that world oil production would peak at about 12.5 billion barrels per year, sometime around the year 2000. He repeated the prediction in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;M. King Hubbert, 1962, ''Energy Resources'', National Academy of Sciences - National Research Council, Publication 1000-D, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; World oil production surpassed his predicted peak in 1967 and kept rising; world oil production did not peak on or near the year 2000, and for the year 2012 was 26.67 billion barrels, more that twice the peak rate Hubbert had projected back in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;OPEC, [http://www.opec.org/library/Annual%20Statistical%20Bulletin/interactive/current/FileZ/Main.htm OPEC Statistical Bulletin], 2013. OPEC world oil production is significantly lower than that calculated by the US Energy Information Administration, because OPEC does not include surface-mined oil, such as Canadian heavy oil sand production.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Hubbert again predicted that world peak oil would occur near 2000, this time in 1995 "if current trends continue."&lt;ref name=grove1974&gt;

===Pessimistic predictions in 2000s===
In 2001, [[Kenneth S. Deffeyes]], professor emeritus of geology at Princeton University, used Hubbert‚Äôs theory to predict that world oil production would peak about 2005, with a possible range of 2003 to 2006. He used the observed growth of production plus reserves to calculate ultimate world oil production of 2.12 trillion barrels, noting: "No educated guesses go in." He considered the application of new technology, but wrote: "This much is certain: no initiative put in place starting today can have a substantial effect on the peak production year." His final conclusion was: "There is nothing plausible that could postpone the peak until 2009. Get used to it."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth S. Deffeyes, [https://www.amazon.com/Hubberts-Peak-Impending-World-Shortage/dp/B001NC2AZW/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388901805&amp;sr=1-8&amp;keywords=hubbert%27s+peak Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage] (Princeton, New Jersey, Princeton University Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; As of late 2009, Deffeyes was still convinced that 2005 had been the peak, and wrote: ‚ÄúI think it unlikely that oil production will ever climb back to the 2005 levels.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth S. Deffeyes, [http://www.princeton.edu/hubbert/current-events-09-11.html ‚ÄúJoin us as we watch the crisis unfolding‚Äù], When Oil Peaked website, 13 Nov. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew Simmons said on October 26, 2006 that global oil production may have peaked in December 2005, though he cautioned that further monitoring of production is required to determine if a peak has actually occurred.&lt;ref&gt;

In October 2009, a report published by the Government-supported [[UK Energy Research Centre]], following 'a review of over 500 studies, analysis of industry databases and comparison of global supply forecasts', concluded that 'a peak in conventional oil production before 2030 appears likely and there is a significant risk of a peak before 2020'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-index.php?page=Global+Oil+Depletion The Global Oil Depletion Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012080159/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-index.php?page=Global+Oil+Depletion |date=2009-10-12 }}, October 08, 2009, [[UK Energy Research Centre]]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors believe this forecast to be valid 'despite the large uncertainties in the available data'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=283 Global Oil Depletion: An assessment of the evidence for a near-term peak in global oil production] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012004031/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=283 |date=2009-10-12 }}, page vii, August 2009, published October 08, 2009, [[UK Energy Research Centre]], {{ISBN|1-903144-03-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was claimed to be the first to undertake an 'independent, thorough and systematic review of the evidence and arguments in the 'peak oil‚Äô debate'.&lt;ref name=UKERC-Oct09 /&gt; The authors noted that 'forecasts that delay a peak in conventional oil production until after 2030 are at best optimistic and at worst implausible' and warn of the risk that 'rising [[price of petroleum|oil prices]] will encourage the rapid development of [[carbon intensity|carbon-intensive]] alternatives that will make it difficult or impossible to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|prevent dangerous climate change]]&lt;ref name=UKERC-Oct09&gt;[http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-index.php?page=0910GlobalOilRelease UKERC Report Finds ‚ÄòSignificant Risk‚Äô of Oil Production Peaking in Ten Years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018120151/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-index.php?page=0910GlobalOilRelease |date=2009-10-18 }}, October 08, 2009, [[UK Energy Research Centre]]&lt;/ref&gt; and that 'early investment in [[alternative energy|low-carbon alternatives]] to conventional oil is of considerable importance' in avoiding this scenario.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=283 Global Oil Depletion: An assessment of the evidence for a near-term peak in global oil production] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012004031/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=283 |date=2009-10-12 }}, page xi, August 2009, published October 08, 2009, [[UK Energy Research Centre]], {{ISBN|1-903144-03-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optimistic predictions in 2000s===
Non-'peakists' can be divided into several different categories based on their specific criticism of peak oil. Some claim that any peak will not come soon or have a dramatic effect on the world economies. Others claim we will not reach a peak for technological reasons, while still others claim our oil reserves are quickly regenerated abiotically.

[[Colin Campbell (geologist)|Colin Campbell]] argued that the 2000 United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates was a methodologically flawed study that has done incalculable damage by misleading international agencies and governments. Campbell dismisses the notion that the world can seamlessly move to more difficult and expensive sources of oil and gas when the need arises. He argued that oil is in profitable abundance or not there at all, due ultimately to the fact that it is a liquid concentrated by nature in a few places that possess the right [[geology|geological conditions]]. Campbell believes [[OPEC]] countries raised their reserves to get higher oil quotas and to avoid internal critique. He has also pointed out that the USGS failed to extrapolate past discovery trends in the world‚Äôs mature basins.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is echoed by [[Jad Mouawad]], who explains that as oil prices rise, new extraction technologies become viable, thus expanding the total recoverable oil reserves. This, according to Mouwad, is one explanation of the changes in peak production estimates.&lt;ref name=mouawad032005&gt;

[[Leonardo Maugeri]], the former group senior vice president, Corporate Strategies of [[Eni|Eni S.p.A.]], dismissed the peak oil thesis in a 2004 policy position piece in  [[Science (journal)|Science]] as "the current model of oil doomsters," and based on several flawed assumptions. He characterized the peak oil theory as part of [[Peak oil#Historical understanding of world oil supply limits|a series of "recurring oil panics"]] that have "driven Western political circles toward oil imperialism and attempts to assert direct or indirect control over oil-producing regions". Maugeri claimed the geological structure of the earth has not been explored thoroughly enough to conclude that the declining trend in discoveries, which began in the 1960s, will continue. He also stated that complete global oil production, discovery trends, and geological data are [[Peak oil#Concerns over stated reserves|not available globally]].&lt;ref name=maugeriscience&gt;{{cite journal

Economist and oil analyst [[Daniel Yergin]] criticizes Hubbert peak oil theory for ignoring the effects of both economics and improved technology.  Yergin believes that world oil production will continue to rise until ‚Äúperhaps sometime around mid-century‚Äù and then ‚Äúplateau‚Äù or enter a gradual decline. He considers it possible that declining oil production, when it comes, will be caused less by resource scarcity than by lower demand brought about by improved efficiency.&lt;ref name="There will be oil,"/&gt;

===Abiogenesis===
{{Main|Abiogenic petroleum origin}}
The theory that petroleum derives from [[Fossil fuel#Origin|biogenic processes]] is held by the overwhelming majority of petroleum geologists. However, [[Abiogenic petroleum origin|abiogenic theorists]], such as the late professor of astronomy [[Thomas Gold]], assert that oil may be a continually renewing [[abiotic]] product, rather than a ‚Äú[[fossil fuel]]‚Äù in [[Non-renewable resources|limited supply]]. They hypothesize that if abiogenic petroleum sources are found and are quick to replenish, petroleum production will not decline.&lt;ref name=nyquist052006&gt;{{cite web

 |title=Debunking Peak Oil

 |publisher=[[Financial Sense]]
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold was not able to prove his theories in experiments&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Gold#Drilling in Siljan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main counter arguments to the abiotic theory is the existence of [[Biomarker (petroleum)|biomarkers in petroleum]]. These chemical compounds can be best explained as residues of biogenic organic matter. They have been found in all oil and gas accumulations tested so far and suggest that oil has a biological origin and is generated from [[kerogen]] by [[pyrolysis]].&lt;ref name=mello2005&gt;{{cite web

Peak Oil as a concept applies globally, but it is based on the summation of individual nations experiencing peak oil.
In ''State of the World 2005'', [[Worldwatch Institute]] observed that oil production was in decline in 33 of the 48 largest oil-producing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Presidential Commission''' ({{Lang-ga|Coimisi√∫n na hUachtar√°nachta}}) is the collective vice-presidency of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

==Membership==
Three members serve on the Presidential Commission.

| [[Denis O Donovan]]
|}

The President of the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] acts as a member in place of the Chief Justice if that office is vacant. The [[Leas-Cheann Comhairle]] acts as a member in place of the Ceann Comhairle if that office is vacant. The [[Leas-Chathaoirleach]] acts as a member in place of the Cathaoirleach if that office is vacant.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Ireland, Articles 14.2.2, 14.2.3, 14.2.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission may act with at least two members.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Ireland, Article 14.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposal to abolish the Seanad, which was [[Thirty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2013|rejected at referendum in 2013]], would have seen the Leas-Cheann Comhairle take the place of the Cathaoirleach on the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/bills28/bills/2013/6313/b63a13d.pdf#page=36|title=Thirty-second Amendment of the Constitution (Abolition of Seanad √âireann) Bill 2013 As passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas|date=17 July 2013|work=Bills 1997-2013|publisher=Oireachtas|page=36 Schedule 3, Part 2, No.9|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/referendum-2013/seanad-results|title=Seanad Results|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers==
The Presidential Commission fulfills all functions and duties of the office of [[President of Ireland]] when the office of President is vacant, or when the President is unavailable.

Vacancy may occur:
* on the death of the incumbent, as in 1974;
* on the resignation of the incumbent, as in 1976 and 1997;
* by [[impeachment#Republic_of_Ireland|impeachment]] of the incumbent, which has never happened.
* in the short interval between the conclusion of one president's term of office and the inauguration of a successor the next day ‚Äî although the Presidential Commission has never been required to act in this time;

The Presidential Commission has often acted when the President is  abroad, typically while making a [[state visit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/the_president/presidential_commission.html|title=Presidential Commission|date=1 May 2008|work=Citizens Information|publisher=Citizens Information Board|accessdate=21 December 2010|location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[government of the 26th D√°il]] collapsed in November 1992, president [[Mary Robinson]] was abroad.  The resignation of the [[Progressive Democrats]] ministers, the appointment by Taoiseach [[Albert Reynolds]] of caretaker [[Fianna F√°il]] replacement ministers, and Reynolds' request for a [[dissolution  of parliament|dissolution of the D√°il]], were all effected by the Presidential Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1992/11/05/00004.asp Private Business. - Ministerial Changes: Statement] D√°il debates, 5 November 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10615F9345E0C758CDDA80994DA494D81|title=Leader Defeated, Irish Government Collapses|last=Clarity|first=James F.|date=6 November 1992|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporary illness may also indispose the President. No President has ever refused to fulfil any of the duties of office.

==Origins==
{{Wikisource|Constitution of Ireland}}
The Presidential Commission was created in the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]]. It was first used between December 1937, when the Constitution came into force, and June 1938, when the first President was inaugurated. Initially, as the Irish senate had not been constituted and elected, the seat on the Presidential Commission intended for the Cathaoirleach of Seanad √âireann was filled by the President of the High Court under the Transitory Provisions of the Constitution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2108">'''Reservation of use and occupancy''' (abbreviated '''ROU''' or '''RUO''') is an arrangement in [[US law]] that allows for residents to continue to use and/or occupy their [[property]] for a certain period after selling that property to the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]].  It is typically provided in exchange for a reduction in the purchase price of the property,&lt;ref name="landac"/&gt; and is commonly used when expanding [[National park|national parks]] and wilderness areas that are in close proximity to residential areas. RUOs are also sometimes provided to businesses operating in areas acquired for wilderness protection.&lt;ref name="drakes"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provisions governing RUOs are found in several different portions of Title 16 of the [[United States Code]], depending on the specific park or other protected area involved.&lt;ref name="460m‚Äì2"&gt;{{usc|16|460m‚Äì2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="410vv‚Äì6"&gt;{{usc|16|410vv‚Äì6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RUOs are often incorrectly referred to as "leasebacks", although residents make no payment to the government during their period of allowed occupancy.&lt;ref name="landac"&gt;{{Cite web

|title=Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore - Land Acquisition

|accessdate=2011-07-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Park Service]], the most common custodian of RUO property, contends that it does not have the power to modify the length or other terms of an RUO, because it is a direct arrangement between the resident and the US government.&lt;ref name="landac"/&gt;&lt;ref name="drakes"/&gt;

'''Sandra Laing''' (born 1955) is a [[South Africa]]n woman who was classified as [[coloureds|coloured]] by authorities during the [[apartheid]] era, due to her skin colour and hair texture, although she was the child of at least three generations of ancestors who had been regarded as [[White_South_African|white]]. At the age of 10, she was expelled from her all-white school, and the authorities' decisions based on her appearance disrupted her family and adult life.

Laing was the subject of the 2008 biographical dramatic film ''[[Skin (2008 film)|Skin]]'', directed by Anthony Fabian, which won numerous awards.&lt;ref name="Skin movie official website"&gt;[http://www.skinthemovie.net ''Skin'' movie official website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=M&amp;Greview&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/multimedia/2010-01-21-iskini-movie-review ''Skin'' film review], ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 21 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, she is the subject of the documentaries ''In Search of Sandra Laing'' (1977), directed by [[Antony Thomas|Anthony Thomas]] for the [[BBC]], which was banned by the apartheid government of the time,&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;
[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2944922.stm "Black Afrikaner" story to become film], BBC News, 29 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sandra Laing: A Spiritual Journey'' (2000), and ''Skin Deep: The Story of Sandra Laing'' (2009).

==Early life==
Sandra Laing was born in 1955 to Sannie and Abraham Laing, [[Afrikaner]]s in [[Piet Retief, Mpumalanga|Piet Retief]], a small conservative town in South Africa during the [[apartheid]] era, when laws governed officially established social castes of racial classification. She had darker skin than other members of her family, which seemed to become more obvious as she grew older. Her parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents were all white, but Sandra displayed the physiognomy of African ancestors of earlier generations, perhaps from the 18th century or more recent.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt; Her family treated her as white, the same as their sons Adriaan and Leon, and together they all attended the Dutch Reformed Church.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;

When Laing was 10 years old and at an all-white boarding school, the school authorities expelled her&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt; because of complaints from the parents of other students, based on her appearance: primarily her skin colour and the texture of her hair. They believed she was "coloured", a term for mixed-race people.&lt;ref name=under&gt;{{cite news|title=Apartheid got under her skin|author=Kim Hawkey|date=10 January 2010|work=Sunday Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was expelled and escorted home by two police officers.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;

Sandra's parents fought several legal battles to have her classified as white, based on her documented ancestry through them. Her father underwent a blood-typing test for [[DNA paternity testing|paternity]] in the 1960s, as [[DNA tests]] were not yet available. The results were compatible with his being her biological father, though such tests are extremely imprecise due to the small number of blood types that most people have.&lt;ref name="carroll"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/mar/17/features11.g2|title=The black woman - with white parents|author=[[Rory Carroll]]|publisher=''The Guardian''|accessdate=17 March 2003|location=London|date=17 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1093674/The-tragic-story-white-girl-born-black-tore-family-apart.html|title=The Tragic Story of How a White Girl Being Born Black Tore a Family Apart|work=The Daily Mail|accessdate=16 August 2011|location=London|date=19 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
After the publicity, Laing found herself shunned by the white community, although she was re-classified as white again in 1966 when the law was changed to allow a person to be classified as white if both parents are classified as white. She attended a coloured boarding school away from her family and became immersed in the non-white world. Her only friends were the children of black employees. At the age of 16, Laing eloped to [[Swaziland]] with Petrus Zwane, a black South African who spoke Zulu. She was jailed for three months for illegal border-crossing. Her father threatened to kill her for the marriage and broke off contact with her. They never met again.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;

Although she and her husband had two children, who were classified as "coloured", she was threatened with losing them unless she also was classified as "coloured", as a white parent could not raise coloured children. At the age of 26, she arranged for the change in race classification officially, although her father had refused permission earlier. Except for secret trips to see her mother when her father was out of the house, Laing was estranged from her family and struggled to survive economically.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt; When her parents moved away from Piet Retief, the clandestine visits were no longer possible. Laing lost contact with her family completely. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Laing and her husband separated due to the pressures they were under, and she put their children into government care for a period. Years later she married again, to Johannes Motloung, a Sotho-speaking man. They had three children together and she was able to reclaim her first two; all are now grown and with families of their own. Trying to reconcile with her family in the 1980s, Laing learned that her father had died and her mother Sannie refused to see her.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;

In 2000 the ''[[Johannesburg Times]]'' tracked down Laing to learn about her years since the end of apartheid. The newspaper helped her find her mother, and they were able to reconcile. Sannie was then in a nursing home. Sannie and the two shared time together before her mother's death in 2001.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;

The publicity helped Laing, her husband and family gain new housing; they now live in Leachville, new estates east of Johannesburg. In 2009, it was reported that Laing's brothers still refused to see her.&lt;ref name="little"/&gt; She has said in interviews with ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''Little White Lies'' that she continued to hope they would some day have a change of heart.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="little"&gt;[http://www.littlewhitelies.co.uk/features/articles/sandra-laing-6079 Sophie Ivan, "Sandra Laing: profile and photo"], ''Little White Lies'', 24 July 2009, accessed 6 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Socialization of animals''' is the process of training animals to be kept by humans in close relationships, especially [[cat]]s and [[working dogs]].

==Ferality==

[[Feral]] animals can be socialized with varying degrees of success.
[[Feral children]] are children who lack socially accepted communication skills. Reports of feral children, such as those cited by Kingsley Davis, have largely been shown to be exaggerations, or complete fabrications, with regards to the specific lack of particular skills; for example, [[bipedalism]].

==Cats==

For example, the [[cat]] returns readily to a feral state if it has not been socialized properly in its young life. A feral cat usually acts defensively. People often unknowingly own one and think it is merely "unfriendly."

Socializing cats older than six months can be very difficult. It is often said that they cannot be socialized. This is not true, but the process takes two to four years of diligent food bribes and handling, and mostly on the cat's terms. Eventually the cat may be persuaded to be comfortable with humans and the indoor environment.

[[Kitten]]s learn to be feral either from their mothers or through bad experiences. They are more easily socialized when under six months of age. Socializing is done by keeping them confined in a small room (i.e. bathroom) and handling them for 3 or more hours each day. There are three primary methods for socialization, used individually or in combination. The first method is to simply hold and pet the cat, so it learns that such activities are not uncomfortable. The second is to use food bribes. The final method is to distract the cat with toys while handling them. The cat may then be gradually introduced to larger spaces. It is not recommended to let the cat back outside because that may cause it to revert to its feral state. The process of socialization often takes three weeks to three months for a kitten.

Animal shelters either foster feral kittens to be socialized or kill them outright. The feral adults are usually killed or [[euthanized]], due to the large time commitment, but some shelters and vets will [[spay or neuter]] and vaccinate a feral cat and then return it to the wild.

[[Image:Big and little dog.jpg|thumb|right|Socialized dogs can interact with other non-aggressive dogs of any size and shape and understand how to communicate.]]

==Dogs==

In domesticated [[dog]]s, the process of socialization begins even before the [[puppy]]'s eyes open. Socialization refers to both its ability to interact acceptably with humans and its understanding of how to communicate successfully with other dogs. If the mother is fearful of humans or of her environment, she can pass along this fear to her puppies. For most dogs, however, a mother who interacts well with humans is the best teacher that the puppies can have. In addition, puppies learn how to interact with other dogs by their interaction with their mother and with other adult dogs in the house.

A mother's attitude and tolerance of her puppies will change as they grow older and become more active. For this reason most experts today recommend leaving puppies with their mother until at least 8 to 10 weeks of age. This gives them a chance to experience a variety of interactions with their mother, and to observe her behavior in a range of situations.

The critical period of socialization commences when they are approximately three weeks old and will continue until they are twelve to fourteen weeks old, during which they move to the next stage of development, the juvenile period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Battaglia|first1=Carmen L|title=Periods of Early Development and the Effects of Stimulation and Social Experiences in the Canine|journal=Journal of Veterinary Behavior: Clinical Applications and Research|date=2009|volume=4|issue=5|pages=203‚Äì210|doi=10.1016/j.jveb.2009.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period of socialization is the time when puppies form social bonds, learn to explore and learn when/how to base fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lord|first1=Kathryn|title=A comparison of the sensory development of wolves (Canis lupus lupus) and dogs (Canis lupus familiaris)|journal=International Journal of Behavioural Biology: Ethology|date=2012|doi=10.1111/eth.12044|volume=119|pages=110‚Äì120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, this stage consists of teaching them how to appropriately react and habituate to environmental changes in preparation for adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.html|website=Merck Veterinary Manual|publisher=Merck Manuals|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523005213/http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.html|archivedate=2016-05-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Habituation]] is the process when a puppy has gotten used to stimuli in their environment and therefore ignores it, deeming it non-threatening.&lt;ref name=DavidAppleby&gt;{{cite web|last1=Appleby|first1=David|title=Puppy Socialisation and Habituation (Part 1) Why is it Necessary?|url=http://www.apbc.org.uk/articles/puppysocialisation1|website=Association of Pet Behaviour Counsellors (APBC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The puppy‚Äôs future personality will be greatly influenced during the socialization period. Their temperament and character is developed throughout this period as well, which will last for the duration of their life. During the socialization stage, all five senses are being stimulated by exposure and desensitization of sights, sounds, tastes, smells and touch of things around them.&lt;ref name=DogTraining&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Puppy Socialization Anyway?|url=http://www.dog-obedience-training-review.com/puppy-socialization.html|website=Dog Training Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is critical that human interaction takes place frequently and calmly from the time the puppies are born, from simple, gentle handling to the mere presence of humans in the vicinity of the puppies, performing everyday tasks and activities. As the puppies grow older, socialization occurs more readily the more frequently they are exposed to other dogs, other people, and other situations. Dogs who are well socialized from birth, with both dogs and other species (especially people), are much less likely to be aggressive or to suffer from fear-biting.

The cognitional development of puppies can be affected when the critical period of socialization is disrupted. Physiological consequences of this period not occurring can lead to puppies maturing to adults who are not able to react appropriately to new environments, situations or people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donovan|first1=Jane|title=Puppy Socialization: When, Why and How to do it Right|url=http://www.akc.org/content/dog-training/articles/puppy-socialization/|website=American Kennel Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, behavioural issues can arise. Aggression, avoidance and fear are just some of the implications that can arise from a puppy not achieving the critical period of socialization.&lt;ref name=Aidan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bindoff|first1=Aidan|title=How to Socialize Your Puppy|url=http://www.clickertraining.com/node/2184|website=Karen Pryor Clicker Training}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that one in four adult dogs have at least one behavioural problem.&lt;ref name=DavidAppleby /&gt; Dogs are the animal which is typically the most closely attached to humans, developing tightly wound relationships with people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=J.P.|title=Critical Periods in the Development of Social Behavior in Puppies|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|date=1958|volume=20|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is crucial for the safety of both parties that there is adequate training in place.

Dogs experience socialization through the critical period of socialization in two main types: active and passive.&lt;ref name=DogTraining /&gt; Active implies the intended socialization of humans introducing their puppy to something/someone new (i.e. at obedience class or a ride in the car). However, passive involves socialization of the puppy to something/someone new in which they have done so unintentionally themselves (i.e. insects found in the backyard while exploring or items found while running around the house).&lt;ref name=DogTraining /&gt;

Dogs will often learn two ways; by association and consequence.&lt;ref name=Aidan /&gt; Learning by association is classified as [[classical conditioning]], while learning by consequence is called [[operant conditioning]]. With puppy socialization, classical conditioning involves pairing something they love with something within the environment.&lt;ref name=Aidan /&gt; Additionally, operant conditioning involves the puppy learning to do something to achieve getting what they want.&lt;ref name=Aidan /&gt; These two learning types can occur simultaneously with a puppy having the ability to learn both an internal and external response to a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. In contrast, a puppy can also demonstrate methods of actively avoiding a situation they do not enjoy.&lt;ref name=Aidan /&gt;

===Socialization experiments===

====Using puppies====

The researchers, Fox and Stelzner did a socialization experiment on puppies of the same species. The major finding of this experiment is the fact that the puppies weaned from the mother at a later age (12 weeks) have better socialization skills. This proves that the beginning of a puppy's life is a very important time for socialization and will affect their social tendencies for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fox, Stelzner|first1=M.W., D|title=The Effects of Early Experience on the development of inter and intraspecies social relationships in the dog|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/0003347267900243/1-s2.0-0003347267900243-main.pdf?_tid=e60413ac-b7c1-11e4-bf77-00000aacb35d&amp;acdnat=1424300594_1983fca0f59063f0e783fc147961f39c|website=sciencedirect.org|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hennessey, Morris, and Linden conducted a socialization experiment using inmates as handlers of the shelter dogs being studied.  These researchers found that the dogs in the experimental group did not jump on and bark at unfamiliar humans as much as the dogs in the control group did. The socialized dogs also showed to be more responsive to commands than did the dogs in the control group. The researchers believe that through more effective socialization, more dogs can be adopted from shelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hennessey, Morris, Linden|first1=Michael, Angel, Fran|title=Evaluation of the Effects of a Socialization program in a Prison on Behavior and pituitary- adrenal hormone levels of shelter dogs|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S016815910500331X/1-s2.0-S016815910500331X-main.pdf?_tid=901b0520-b7c3-11e4-b3f7-00000aab0f02&amp;acdnat=1424301309_982c0a2687c752b1e3e45312d6caf3f0|website=sciencedirect.org|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Battagalia claims that there are 3 important periods during the first year of life for a puppy.  Her research shows that if puppies experience stimulation from humans during the first few months of their lives, they will be less likely to feel stress in their adult lives and they will be better socialized. She claims this is a very important thing for dog breeders to know to improve the success of their puppy's future lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Battagalia|first1=Carmen|title=Periods of early development and the effects of stimulation and social experience in the canine|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1558787809001555/1-s2.0-S1558787809001555-main.pdf?_tid=ac8cf0cc-b7cf-11e4-a2c3-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1424306511_cc32766cf3f06ccad34ec469e8cd8104|website=sciencedirect.org|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Using dog and wolf puppies====

A study done by the six researchers, Top√°l, G√°csi, Mikl√≥si, Zir√°nyi, Kubinyi, and Cs√°nyi compares the inherent social tendencies between dog puppies and wolf puppies. What these researchers found was that dog puppies showed attachment to their owners and showed to be more responsive to their owner than an unfamiliar person. The wolf puppies did not show to be more responsive to their owners than to an unfamiliar human. Researchers concluded that this is a genetic difference between species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Top√°l, G√°csi, Mikl√≥si, Zir√°nyi, Kubinyi, and Cs√°nyi|title=Attachment to humans: A comparative study on hand-reared wolves and differently socialized dog puppies|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0003347205003155/1-s2.0-S0003347205003155-main.pdf?_tid=ba0826e8-b7c7-11e4-bb57-00000aab0f6b&amp;acdnat=1424303097_1ec0ed507bd55844a85c043bef0a2e42|website=sciencedirect.org|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These six researchers attempted to answer the question, "Why?" in their next experiment. They found that dogs were more successful in finding hidden food and in completing a learned task than wolves were. The most prominent observation these researchers made was that the dogs would look into the eyes of the human as if looking for a clue and the wolves would not look at the faces of the humans.  They concluded that this is a genetic difference between the two species as a result of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Top√°l, G√°csi, Mikl√≥si, Zir√°nyi, Kubinyi, and Cs√°nyi.|title=A simple reason for a big difference: Wolves do not look back at humans but dogs do|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S096098220300263X/1-s2.0-S096098220300263X-main.pdf?_tid=d03f0f38-b7c9-11e4-bfa5-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1424303994_6c63620c38dc46c1768ebdf65368315c|website=sciencedirect.org|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monkeys==

Monkeys are often studied because of the close evolutionary relationship between monkeys and humans.Like humans, some monkeys tend to show declining social activity with age. Research has shown that older females spent less time grooming other and interacted with fewer animals than younger individuals did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Almeling|first=L|year=2016|title=BEHAVIOUR Older monkeys socialize less|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v534/n7609/full/534593b.html|journal=Nature|volume=534|pages=593|via=|doi=10.1038/534593b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socialization experiments===

Bernstein and Ehardt conducted an experiment on aggressive behavior of [[rhesus monkey]]s. They found that the monkeys showed more aggression towards kin than non-kin, mostly from older kin to younger kin.  This supports the hypothesis that aggression is used in socialization and correction of inappropriate behaviors in the immature monkeys. If the aggression is no more severe than is needed to correct the behavior, it can improve the survival rate of all the relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bernstein, Ehardt|first1=Irwin, Carolyn|title=The influence of kinship and socialization on aggressive behaviour in rhesus monkeys|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0003347286800574/1-s2.0-S0003347286800574-main.pdf?_tid=471956ac-b7d1-11e4-ab79-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1424307199_932a61c4189f2b36333febea883f6e18|website=sciencedirect.org|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Berman researched the mother-infant relationship of rhesus monkeys both in the wild and in captivity.  She found many similarities between the two parenting styles but some minor differences. The captive mother has been described as more protective and less willing to let their infant out of their control. The difference that likely has to most effect on this relationship is, the wild monkey has kin around which helps with the socialization of the infant, and the mother in captivity does not. This shows how environmental factors can affect the early socialization of infant rhesus monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berman|first1=Carol|title=MOTHER-INFANT RELATIONSHIPS AMONG FREE-RANGING RHESUS MONKEYS ON CAYO SANTIAGO: A COMPARISON WITH CAPTIVE PAIRS|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0003347280801461/1-s2.0-S0003347280801461-main.pdf?_tid=ed4bebae-b7d4-11e4-942c-00000aab0f6b&amp;acdnat=1424308767_0811afd3f16d0188d341435f23bb9974|website=sciencedirect.org|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialization at a young age has been seen to affect sexual behavior in the adult rhesus monkey, in a study done by, Gold, Wallen, and Goldfoot. This is not seen as prominently in rats, and other small animals as it is in primates. The monkeys have difficulty acting normally even when a sexual opportunity presents itself, this is due to the fact that they have affectional disorders that they do not often overcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goy, Wallen, Goldfoot|first1=Robert, Kim, David|title=Social Factors Affecting the Development of Mounting Behavior in Male Rhesus Monkeys|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-3069-1_10 |accessdate=19 February 2015|doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-3069-1_10|journal=Advances in Behavioral Biology|pages=223‚Äì247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very difficult to study the lives of isolated children so researchers have turned to studying the effect of total isolation on rhesus monkeys. Completely isolated monkey's first response to stimulus is fear or aggression.  They do not learn any normal socio-emotional skills. When these monkeys are able to come in contact with a group, they do not know how to interact and would not be able to survive in a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harlow, Dodsworth, Harlow|first1=Harry, Robert, Margaret|title=Total social isolation in monkeys|pmc=285801|pmid=4955132|volume=54|year=1965|journal=Proc.

==Accounts of a life==
In 1957, the war [[memoir]] of a Jewish woman, Stella  Krentsbach, circulated in a collection edited by Ukrainian writer [[Petro Mirchuk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1999/229912.shtml |title=Obituary : Petro Mirchuk, member of liberation movement|last=|first=|author-link= |publisher=|date=30 April 1999 |website=[[The Ukrainian Weekly]] |access-date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text began with the words, "The reason that I'm alive today and can devote all of my energy to the state of Israel is thanks only to God and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army."&lt;ref name=mirchuk&gt;{{cite book |last1= Krentsbach |first1=Stella |authorlink1= |last2= |first2=|editor-last=Mirchuk|editor-first=Petro (ed.)|editor-link=Petro Mirchuk|chapter=Alive thanks to the UPA |date=1957|title=A Collection of Reports from Former Soldiers of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memoir author writes that she was born in [[Bolekhiv]], near [[Lvov]], the daughter of a [[rabbi]], and she was a childhood friend of Olya, the daughter of a [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic priest]]. In 1939, according to the memoir, Stella Krentsbakh graduated from the [[Philosophy]] department of the [[University of Lviv]]. When the war broke out, she joined the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]], where she served as a [[nurse]] and an [[intelligence officer]]. In the spring of 1945, with the Soviet forces having recaptured the whole of the Ukraine, the [[NKVD]] arrested Stella  Krentsbach during a meeting she had with a contact in [[Rozhniativ]]. She was jailed and sentenced to death, but UPA fighters managed to free her. In the summer of 1945, she crossed the [[Carpathians]] with other Ukrainian insurgents and, on the 1st of October, she reached the [[Allied-occupied Austria|English zone of occupation]] in [[Austria]], from where she traveled to [[Israel]]. In her new country, according to the memoir, she worked in the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Ministry of Foreign  Affairs]].&lt;ref name=mirchuk/&gt;

==Resonance==
The story of Stella Krentsbakh received significant attention in the [[Ukrainian diaspora]] press.&lt;ref name=beck&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rudling|first=Per Anders|author-link=Per Anders Rudling |last2= |first2= |date=November 2011|title=The OUN, the UPA and the Holocaust: A Study in the Manufacturing of Historical Myths |url=https://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/download/164/160 |format=PDF |journal=The Carl Beck Papers in Russian &amp; East European Studies|publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]]|volume= |issue=2107 |pages=|doi=|issn=0889-275X|access-date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists attempted to locate her in Israel, but she could not be found.  Stories and rumors started circulating in [[√©migr√©]] circles that the woman had been murdered in Israel, supposedly for telling the truth about the UPA‚Äôs attitude to the Jews.&lt;ref name=beck/&gt; 

Historian [[Filip Friedman|Philip Friedman]], a survivor of the Holocaust from [[Western Ukraine]], remarked that "the only data about her was published in an [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] paper."&lt;ref name=Friedman&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=Philip |editor-last=|editor-first= |title=Roads to Extinction: Essays on the Holocaust|publisher=Jewish Publication Society of America|date=1980  |chapter=Ukrainian-Jewish Relations During the Nazi Occupation|pages=203-204 |isbn=978-0827601703}}&lt;/ref&gt; He searched through the ''[[Washington Post]]'' of that period and could not find the memoirs, as he wrote. After making an inquiry to Israel's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Ministry of Foreign  Affairs]], he received the reply, as he reported, that they never had an employee there by that name and also  that a case of a [[homicide]] in Israel with a victim by that name was "entirely unknown." Friedman stated he undertook a "careful analysis of the text" of the memoir and the examination led him to the conclusion that "the entire story is a hoax."&lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt; 

As [[American-Canadian]] historian [[John-Paul Himka]] wrote, [https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/–ö–æ—Ä–¥—é–∫_–ë–æ–≥–¥–∞–Ω Bohdan Kordiuk], one-time leader of the Home Executive of UPA, repudiated&lt;ref group=note&gt; in the newspaper ''Suchasna Ukraina'' ("Contemporary Ukraine"), issue no. 15/194, 20 July 1958&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/AERODYNAMIC%20%20%20VOL.%2014%20%20(OPERATIONS)_0049.pdf |title=Re: Newspapers 'Suchasna Ukraina,' 'Ukrainsky Samostiynyk,' and 'Ukrainska Literaturna Hazeta.'  |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|date=23 April 1957|website= |access-date=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the memoirs as fake, soon after their original publication. Kordiuk wrote that ‚Äúnone of the UPA men known to the author of these lines knows the legendary Stella Krenzbach or have heard of her. The Jews do not know her either. It is unlikely that anyone of the tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees after the war met Stella Krenzbach‚Äù and concluded: ‚ÄúIt seems to us that until there are proper proofs, the story of Dr. Stella Krenzbach has to be regarded as a mystification.‚Äù&lt;ref name=kyiv&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.kyivpost.com/article/opinion/op-ed/falsifying-world-war-ii-history-in-ukraine-103895.html?cn-reloaded=1| title=Falsifying World War II history in Ukraine| last= Himka| first=John-Paul|author-link=John-Paul Himka| work=[[Kyiv Post]] | date=8 May 2011 | accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of propaganda==
Both supporters and deniers of the veracity of the Stella Krenzbach life story have accused the other side of [[propaganda]].

Jewish-Ukrainian [[poet]] [[Moysey Fishbein]] attributed the disputes of the Krenzbach memoir to "Russia‚Äôs special services" that "are seeking to destabilize the situation in Ukraine, undermine its sovereignty and independence, create a negative image of this country, block its integration into European and Euro-Atlantic structures, and turn Ukraine into a dependent and manipulated satellite." Fishbein claimed that the Russians "attribute exceptional importance" to the so-called ‚ÄúJewish card,‚Äù by seeking to "set  Ukrainians and Jews against each other."&lt;ref name=fishbein&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.kyivpost.com/article/opinion/op-ed/the-jewish-card-in-russian-operations-against-ukra-44324.html |title=The Jewish card in Russian operations against Ukraine |last= Fishbein |first=Moysey  |author-link=Moysey Fishbein|publisher=|date=30 June 2009 |work=[[Kyiv Post]] |access-date= 20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fishbein's viewpoint was supported by American political analyst [[Paul A. Goble]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://www.moldova.org/en/russia-special-services-again-play-the-jewish-card-against-ukraine-202438-eng/|title=Russia Special Services Again Play the ‚ÄòJewish Card‚Äô against Ukraine |last=  Goble |first=Paul A.  |author-link=Paul A. Goble|publisher=Moldova.org|date= 2017 |work=[[Kyiv Post]] |access-date= 20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukrainian historian [[Volodymyr Viatrovych]] has repeatedly proclaimed the veracity and accuracy of the Krenzbach life story, as related in the published text, attributing the denials to those who "accuse the OUN" of having been "anti-Semitic."&lt;ref name=beck/&gt;

Historian and researcher [[Grzegorz Rossoli≈Ñski-Liebe]] denoted the 1957 memoir as "fake," and as being part of the "memory narrative in which Ukrainians appeared as heroes and victims, but not as perpetrators," a narrative that, as he stated, was "from a political perspective, advantageous to the nationalist factions of the Ukrainian diaspora during the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref name=memory&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Grzegorz Rossoli≈Ñski-Liebe|last2= |first2= |editor-last1=Schlemmer |editor-first=Thomas |editor-last2=Steinweis |editor-first2=Alan E. |title=Holocaust and Memory in Europe: Holocaust and Memory in Europe|publisher=De Gruyter Oldenbourg |date=2016|format=PDF |pages=118-141|chapter=Holocaust Amnesia: The Ukrainian Diaspora and the Genocide of the Jews|chapterurl=https://www.newcoldwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/The-Ukrainian-Diaspora-and-the-Genocide-of-the-Jews-Grzegorz-Rossoli√±ski-Liebe.pdf?422af0&amp;422af0|last1= Rossoli≈Ñski-Liebe |first1=Grzegorz |isbn=978-3110466805 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[John-Paul Himka]] stated that the "Stella Krentsbakh/Kreutzbach forged biography" shows that the OUN, the UPA, and their "promoters" have to "resort to falsifications to defend their innocence vis-√†-vis the [[Holocaust]]," which "indicates that they lack real evidence [in] their possession [about the alleged Jewish element among the nationalist organizations]," and concluded that "no one grabs for [[fig leaf|fig leaves]] when they are wearing clothes."&lt;ref name=kyiv/&gt;

'''''Die Stadt ohne Juden''''' (''The City Without Jews'') is a 1924 Austrian [[Expressionist]] film by [[H. K. Breslauer]], based on the book of the same title by [[Hugo Bettauer]]. The film is one of the few surviving Expressionist films from Austria and has therefore been well researched.&lt;ref name="medienimpulse"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas |last=Ballhausen |first2=G√ºnter |last2=Krenn |title=(Alb)Traumhaft: Die Stadt ohne Juden |journal=Medienimpulse |volume=57 |date=September 2006 |pages=35‚Äì39 |url=http://www.mediamanual.at/mediamanual/themen/pdf/sicherheit/57_Ballhausen-Krenn-Die_unheimliche_Leinwand.pdf |accessdate=19 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was first shown on 25 July 1924 in [[Vienna]].

In his novel, published in 1922, Hugo Bettauer succeeded in creating a relatively accurate allegorical vision of the near future, although the book was intended as entertainment and as a satirical response to the primitive [[antisemitism]] of the 1920s. It immediately became Bettauer's most popular work: it was translated into several languages, and sold over a quarter of a million copies. Shortly after the premiere of the film Hugo Bettauer was murdered by [[Otto Rothstock]], a former member of the [[Nazi Party]], who was lionized by the antisemitic Austrian masses and was released less than two years after having been committed to a psychiatric institution.&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alexander P. Moulton|title=A Wary Silence: Karl Kraus in Interwar Vienna|journal=The Columbia Historical Review|volume=2|date=Winter 2002|pages=15‚Äì43|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/history/pdf/chr_vol2.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317005326/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/history/pdf/chr_vol2.pdf|archive-date=2007-03-17|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
In Austria the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] comes to power, and the new Chancellor Dr.&amp;nbsp;Schwerdtfeger, a fanatical antisemite, sees his people as being ruled by the Jews. He therefore has a law passed by the National Assembly forcing all Jews to emigrate by the end of the year. The law is enthusiastically received by the non-Jewish population, and the Jews leave the country. But after a short time a sober reality makes itself felt. Cultural life becomes impoverished: in the theatres only plays by [[Ludwig Ganghofer]] and [[Ludwig Anzengruber]] are still performed. Many cafes are empty, or are converted into beer halls selling sausages. After an initial upturn, the economy declines, as business has greatly diminished, and has moved to other cities, such as [[Prague]] and [[Budapest]]. Inflation and unemployment run wild.

The political characters of the book (although not of the film, to avoid difficulties with censorship) are delineated in such a way as to be identifiable with real politicians of the period: Bundeskanzler Schwerdtfeger, for example, is based on [[Ignaz Seipel]]. Besides the political action, the film also dwells on the love relationship between Lotte ([[Anny Milety]]), a typical Viennese girl (''Wiener M√§del'') and the daughter of a member of the National Assembly who voted for the banishment of the Jews, and the Jewish artist Leo Strakosch ([[Johannes Riemann]]).

Towards the end of the film, the National Assembly resolves to bring the Jews back again. However, to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority, Lotte and Leo, who has already illegally returned to Austria with forged papers identifying him as a French painter, have to remove the antisemitic parliamentary representative Bernard (played by [[Hans Moser (actor)|Hans Moser]]), which they do by getting him drunk. The drama reaches a peak as he is committed to a psychiatric institution represented in Expressionist scenery, where in a claustrophobic and asymmetrically painted cell, he sees himself threatened by [[Star of David|Stars of David]].

This sequence also represents the divergence of the film from the book, as the action of the film is revealed as a dream of the antisemitic Councillor Bernard. This surprising turn of events was described in the original film program as:
"In this moment of the highest distress Councillor Bernard awakes from his dream, finds himself in the tavern at a very late hour and says to the baffled Volbert: 'Thank God that stupid dream is over‚Äîwe are all just people and we don't want hate‚Äîwe want life‚Äîwe want to live together in peace.'"&lt;ref&gt;''"Gottlob, da√ü der dumme Traum vorbei ist ‚Äì wir sind ja alle nur Menschen und wollen keinen Ha√ü ‚Äì Leben wollen wir ‚Äì ruhig nebeneinander leben"''. Kivur, Nr. 1346, o.J., o.S.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The film was made in 1924, about two years after the publication of Bettauer's novel. It differs from the book in several ways: for example, the city in the film is called "Utopia", instead of "Vienna". The film also has conciliatory happy ending, which is not only the exact opposite of the message of the book, but also represents a surprising and abrupt change of direction within the film itself, the whole of which is thus revealed as the dream of an antisemite who at last comes to the realisation that the Jews are a "necessary evil".&lt;ref&gt;''Die Filmwelt'', 1924, n. 14‚Äì15, pp. 6‚Äì7&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for these fundamental deviations from the original was to reduce the controversial political impact of the content.

The film was Hans Moser's second cinematic role. The female lead was played, as so often in Breslauer's films, by Anny (or Anna) Milety, whom he later married (in 1925). The well-known Jewish actors [[Gisela Werbisek]] (billed as "Werbezirk") and [[Armin Berg]] appeared only in minor roles, as Kathi the cook and Isidor the commissionaire. The Expressionist backdrops and decor which characterise some scenes were the work of [[Julius von Borsody]].

Other cast members were [[Eugen Neufeld]] (Bundeskanzler Dr. Schwerdtfeger), [[Karl Thema]] (Cllr. Linder), [[Ferdinand Mayerhofer]] (Cllr. Volbert), [[Mizi Griebl]] (Volbert's wife) and [[Hans Effenberger]] (Alois Carroni).

== Performance history ==
The premiere took place on 25 July 1924 in Vienna, although there were still technical problems with the film. Bettauer and Breslauer, the director, fell out entirely, and Bettauer later refused to acknowledge any connection between the film and his book. The technically inferior prints of the film were often manually cut and shortened by the cinema owners themselves. Nevertheless, the cinema auditoriums were often full, although not only in Austria but also in [[Berlin]] (premiere 1926) and [[New York City|New York]] (premiere 1928, where it was shown as ''The City Without Jews''), it was very clear that the success of the film was not as great as that of the book. There were sometimes disturbances at performances: [[Nazism|National Socialists]] often threw stinkbombs into the cinemas; in [[Linz]] the showing of the film was banned.&lt;ref name="korso"&gt;Heimo Halbrainer on [http://www.korso.at/korso/DStmk/bett.htm www.korso.at ‚Äì Informationsmagazin f√ºr die Steiermark], July 2001 (page viewed on 19 January 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

A campaign of vilification against Bettauer was instigated, partly because of this film and partly because of his other activities. In the spring of 1925 he was murdered by a [[Nazi Party]] member, [[Otto Rothstock]], who was hailed as a hero and despite being found guilty of murder, was soon set free.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 1933, the film was shown commercially for the last time, again causing a stir, when it was screened in the [[Amsterdam]] theatre ''Carr√©'' as a protest against Hitler's Germany. This copy of the film is presumably the same as the one discovered in 1991 in the [[Nederlands Filmmuseum]]. It was on a [[cellulose nitrate]] base and on the point of disintegration, as well as being incomplete. The German [[Bundesarchiv]] in [[Coblenz]] therefore made an "emergency copy", which was then reconstructed on behalf of the [[Filmarchiv Austria]] (Austrian Film Archive) by the company HS-ART Digital Service of [[Graz]] using the "DIAMANT" software developed by [[Joanneum Research]]; faded parts were then re-coloured.&lt;ref name="korso"/&gt; In October 2008, the film was made available on a portable medium for the first time as part of the DVD series  ''Der √∂sterreichische Film''.

In 2015, a copy of the whole film in excellent condition was found in a flea-market in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Noack |first=Rick |date=March 30, 2018 |title=Long-lost film that predicted rise of anti-Semitism has ominous message for today's world |publisher=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/03/30/long-lost-film-that-warned-of-rise-of-anti-semitism-has-ominous-message-for-todays-world |quote=The film ‚Äî which sparked furious reactions in the mid-1920s ‚Äî was believed to have been lost until a copy was discovered in a Paris flea market in 2015.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian Film Archive organised a crowd-funding campaign to save the film to which more than 700 people contributed more than ‚Ç¨86,000 (¬£72,000; $107,000). This full version of the film was digitally restored and re-released in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;(29 March 2018).

== Critical reaction ==
"In many places the film follows the original book almost word for word, which makes the Utopian ending even more obviously an expression of appeasement. At the end the surprised audience learns that the entire dramatic action only took place in a dream, and thus never really happened. The on-screen happy ending, dictated by compromise, not only negates the meaning of Bettauer's book but also the very real antisemitism that it reflects. Instead it documents a by no means unthinkable and in no way dreamlike reality [...] This surprising turn of the plot, deviating totally from the literary original, which simplifies the action as the content of a dream, cannot merely be regarded as a simple dramatic exigency, but as a prime example of the Austrian soul's ability to repress. This na√Øve and perhaps crude experiment from 1924 can be taken as a forerunner of what was generally practised after [[World War II]] in the country ''ohne Eigenschaften''"&lt;ref&gt;An allusion to [[Robert Musil]]'s novel ''[[Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften]]'' (English translations as ''The Man Without Qualities''.&lt;/ref&gt;(Thomas Ballhausen, G√ºnter Krenn, 2006).&lt;ref name="medienimpulse"/&gt;

The Gospel of Wealth by Andrew Carnegie]&lt;/ref&gt; is an article written by [[Andrew Carnegie]] in June&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Carnegie.Gospel of Wealth|url = https://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/rbannis1/AIH19th/Carnegie.html|website = www.swarthmore.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 1889&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5767/|title=The Gospel According to Andrew: Carnegie's Hymn to Wealth|accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that describes the responsibility of [[philanthropy]] by the [[Nouveau riche|new upper class of self-made rich]]. Carnegie proposed that the best way of dealing with the new phenomenon of wealth inequality was for the wealthy to utilize their surplus means in a responsible and thoughtful manner. This approach was contrasted with traditional bequest (patrimony), where wealth is handed down to heirs, and other forms of bequest e.g. where wealth is willed to the state for public purposes. Benjamin Soskis, a historian of philanthropy, refers to the article as the '[[Urtext edition|urtext]]' of modern philanthropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Both More and No More: The Historical Split between Charity and Philanthropy
|url = https://www.hudson.org/research/10723-both-more-and-no-more-the-historical-split-between-charity-and-philanthropy|website = hudson.org|accessdate = 2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie argued that surplus wealth is put to best use (i.e. produces the greatest net benefit to society) when it is administered carefully by the wealthy. Carnegie also argues against wasteful use of capital in the form of extravagance, irresponsible spending, or self-indulgence, instead promoting the administration of said capital over the course of one's lifetime toward the cause of reducing the stratification between the rich and poor. As a result, the wealthy should administer their riches responsibly and not in a way that encourages "the slothful, the drunken, the unworthy".

== Andrew Carnegie ==
"I should consider it a disgrace to die a rich man" - [[Andrew Carnegie]], 1887 {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

=== Early life ===
Andrew Carnegie was born in [[Dunfermline]], Scotland in 1835. The only schooling he received was from the local grammar school. He held onto his Scottish roots throughout most of his life - he retained close ties with his relative that stayed in Scotland; many of his early business associates were americanized Scots; his English school friends had Scottish ties; he returned home to Scotland almost every summer. Even his radicalism can be tied to his Scottish roots. His immediate family rejected the establishment, from his grandfather who was a controversial orator and contributor to ''Register'', [[William Cobbett|William Cobbet's]] political journal, to his mother and father, who rejected the Presbyterian Church.

Due to their radicalism, the Carnegies moved to Antebellum America in 1848. His father lost nearly everything he owned, and never recovered from the shock of his poverty, so Carnegie's mother supported the family until he, himself, was able to become the primary breadwinner, and support the family. He felt indebted to his mother for the rest of his life, which contributed to his determination to succeed, and his generosity with his money later in life. Carnegie didn't marry until after his mother died.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Industrial life ===
Unlike many industrialists of his time, Carnegie was not an inventor or a risk-taking [[Wall Street]] financier. Many of his fellow capitalists financed their various business ventures with watered-down stocks. This is not how Carnegie chose to conduct his business. All of his early organizations were either partnerships or associations. He chose to focus on the vertical integration of a single industry, specifically the steel industry. Most others made their profits by creating a horizontal monopoly. He worked hard to control entire industries, rather than parts of many. By 1890, Carnegie was a multi-millionaire.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Scholar and activist ===
At the age of 35, Carnegie decided to limit his personal wealth and donate the surplus to benevolent causes. He was determined to be remembered for his good deeds rather than his wealth. He became a "radical" philanthropist. Prior to publishing his ideas about wealth, he began donating to his favorite causes, starting by donating a public bath to his hometown of Dunfermline.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Snow|first = Vernon|date = July 1991|title = Andrew Carnegie's Gospel of Wealth|url =|journal = Society|doi =10.1007/bf02695689|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie never pursued a formal education. At one point, he wrote that he wished to attend Oxford University, but that never happened. Instead, he spent most of his free time as a young adult reading and educating himself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Death ===
[[Andrew Carnegie]] died in 1919 in [[Lenox, Massachusetts]]. His autobiography was published posthumously in 1920, which contained many gaps, since he died in the midst of writing his book about the outbreak of the First World War.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Publication ==
As Carnegie tried to live his life in a way that the poor could benefit from his wealth, he decided he needed to share his ideas with the public. In 1880, he published his controversial views in an article entitled "Wealth" in the ''[[North American Review]],'' an opinion magazine for America's establishment. It was later published as "The Gospel of Wealth" in the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]''.

== Assertions ==

The Gospel of Wealth asserts that hard work and perseverance lead to wealth.

Carnegie based his philosophy on the observation that the heirs of large fortunes frequently squandered them in riotous living rather than nurturing and growing them. Even bequeathing one's fortune to [[Charitable organization|charity]] was no guarantee that it would be used wisely, due to the fact that there was no guarantee that a charitable organization not under one's direction would use the money in accordance with one's wishes. Carnegie disapproved of charitable giving that  maintained the poor in their impoverished state, and urged a movement toward the creation of a new mode of giving that would create opportunities for the beneficiaries of the gift to better themselves. As a result, the gift would not be simply consumed, but would be productive of even greater wealth throughout the house.

In "The Gospel of Wealth", Carnegie examines the modes of distributing accumulated wealth and capital to the communities from which they originate.  He preached that ostentatious living and amassing private treasures were wrong.  He praised the high British taxes on the estates of dead millionaires, remarking that "By taxing estates heavily at death the State marks its condemnation of the selfish millionaire's unworthy life. It is desirable that nations should go much further in this direction."&lt;ref name="Wealth"/&gt;

Carnegie made it clear that the duty of the rich was to live modest lifestyles,&lt;ref&gt;http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1889carnegie.asp&lt;/ref&gt; and that any surplus of money they had was best suited for re-circulation back into society where it could be used to support the greater good. He shunned aristocratic chains of inheritance and argued that dependents should be supported by their work with major moderation, with the bulk of excess wealth to be spent on enriching the community. In cases where excess wealth was held until death, he advocated its apprehension by the state on a [[Progressive tax|progressive]] scale: "Indeed, it is difficult to set bounds to the share of a rich man's estates which should go at his death to the public through the agency of the State, and by all means such taxes should be granted, beginning at nothing upon moderate sums to dependents, and increasing rapidly as the amounts swell, until of the millionaire's hoard, at least the other half comes to the privy coffer of the State."&lt;ref name="Wealth"/&gt; .

== Reception ==
When Carnegie Steel busted the union in 1892, Carnegie was able to keep himself from blame because he focused on his new doctrine for the wealthy. [[Homestead Strike|The Homestead Strike]] ended in a showdown between 300 Pinkerton guards and a crowd of steel workers and supporters devolved into an exchange of gunfire. This outbreak left 7 workers and 3 guards dead, and many more wounded. It made headlines around the world, and reporters reached Carnegie, who was in Scotland at the time. When questioned, Carnegie called the violence "deplorable" but otherwise pleaded ignorance, and stated "I have given up all active control of the business." This move kept him innocent, and he began to focus on his philanthropic work and teaching the Gospel of Wealth. His good works still benefit people around the globe, and people saw that in him. The Homestead Strike did little to mar his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ernsberger|first=Richard|date=February 2015|title=Andrew Carnegie: Robber Baron turned Robin Hood|url=|journal=American History|pages=32‚Äì41|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie's controversial views on wealth sparked a trans-Atlantic debate that argued the nature, purpose, and disposition of wealth.

=== William Ewart Gladstone ===
[[William Ewart Gladstone]], the head of the Liberal Party in England, and a friend of Carnegie's, had some sharp remarks on the publication. Even though they were close friends and had similar political ideals, Gladstone did not agree with Carnegie's paper. Gladstone defended [[primogeniture]], unlimited inheritance, and the British Aristocracy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This led to many other critics joining Gladstone in denouncing Carnegie's "radical" philanthropic ways.

These critical reviews led Carnegie to publish a series of essays defending himself. He defended individualism, private property, and the accumulation of personal wealth on the grounds that they benefited the human race in the long run. In an effort to convince his critics that he wasn't saying everyone should get free handouts from the upper class, he edited his original doctrine, so that it read "Help those who will help themselves, to provide part of the means by which those who desire to improve may do so." Since many interpreted his writing to mean that all those in poverty should be assisted by the wealthy, it was necessary for Carnegie to clarify that charity has its limitations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Phoebe Apperson Hearst's "Gospel of Wealth" ===
In 1901, U.S. Senator [[Jonathan P. Dolliver|Jonathan Prentiss Dolliver]] wrote an article for the celebrity magazine ''Success'', titled "[[Phoebe Hearst|Phoebe Apperson Hearst]] and the New Gospel of Wealth".  Hearst was an American philanthropist and [[suffragist]]. According to Dolliver, Hearst saw inadequacies of public schools and was concerned about urban poverty and vice. She, like Carnegie, believed that as a millionaire, it was her duty to help those less fortunate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolliver|first=Jonathan|date=1901|title=Phoebe Apperson Hearst and The New Gospel of Wealth|url=|journal=Success|issue=4|pages=839‚Äì840|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of Dolliver's article was to explain Hearst's "Gospel of Wealth" and illustrate how she should be viewed as a complementary equal to men like Carnegie. She declared that women who were wealthy had a sacred and moral duty to give away their fortunes to causes, especially progressive education and reform, to benefit their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nickliss|first=Alexandra|date=2002|title=Phoebe Apperson Hearst's "Gospel of Wealth," 1883-1901|url=|journal=Pacific Historical Review|volume=71|issue=4|pages=575‚Äì605|doi=10.1525/phr.2002.71.4.575|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Carnegie, Hearst was very concerned with giving the lower class the opportunity to be educated at the same level at which the upper class was educated. Also like Carnegie, she established her own free public library. Hers was located in [[Anaconda, Montana]].

== Relevance in the Modern Age ==
{{Further|Carnegie libraries}}
[[File:BCL 1024x768.jpg|thumb|[[Carnegie Free Library of Braddock]] in [[Braddock, Pennsylvania]], built in 1888, was the first [[Carnegie Library]] in the United States.]]

Carnegie put his philosophy into practice through a program of gifts to endow [[public libraries]], known as '[[Carnegie libraries]]' in cities and towns throughout the United States and the [[English-speaking world]], with the idea that he was thus providing people with the tools to better themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Abigail Ayres Van Slyck ''Free To All'', p. 22, University of Chicago Press, 1995 {{ISBN|978-0-226-85031-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to ensure that his gifts would not be wasted, he stipulated that the municipality must pass an ordinance establishing a [[tax]] to support the library's ongoing operating costs after the initial grant provided the costs for building and equipping the library. Each of these organizations had its own endowment and its own board of trustees. Many of them still exist today.

After several communities squandered their grants on extravagant buildings, Carnegie established a system of [[architectural]] guidelines that mandated simplicity and functionality. When it became obvious that Carnegie could not give away his entire fortune within his lifetime, he established the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] to continue his program of giving.

Little Free Libraries are starting to pop up in cities like [[Ann Arbor]] and [[Detroit]], Michigan, and [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. These free libraries follow Carnegie's philosophy of offering to the lower class things that the upper class already has access to. Little Free Libraries is an organization that stocks books in boxes throughout inner-city areas for the youth to enjoy. For many reasons, these kids don't have access to regular libraries. Having instant access to books in their neighborhood is beneficial in helping them improve their literacy and progress with their education at the same pace as the children in the more affluent neighborhoods.

'''''Unequal Protection: The Rise of Corporate Dominance and the Theft of Human Rights''''' is a 2004 book by [[Thom Hartmann]].  The book explains that the largest and most powerful [[transnational corporation]]s dominate the lives of most of the world's citizens. According to the book, their [[CEO]]s are "unapproachable and live lives of nearly unimaginable wealth and luxury"; they value growth and profit no matter what the cost, and this has become disruptive for life on [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=72-9781579549558-0 Unequal Protection: The Rise of Corporate Dominance and the Theft of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi/1044.html Book Review: Unequal Protection: The Rise of Corporate Dominance and the Theft of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/views02/1226-04.htm Sing, Dance, Rejoice‚ÄîCorporate Personhood Is Doomed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917191038/http://www.commondreams.org/views02/1226-04.htm |date=September 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of the Union of African States (1958-1961).svg|thumb|right|250px|Flag between 1958 and 1961.]]

The '''Union of African States''' ({{lang-fr|Union des √âtats africains}}), sometimes called the '''Ghana‚ÄìGuinea‚ÄìMali Union''', was a short-lived and loose [[regional organization]] formed 1958 linking the [[West Africa]]n nations of [[Ghana]] and [[Guinea]] as the '''Union of Independent African States'''. [[Mali]] joined in 1960. It disbanded in 1963.

The union planned to develop a common currency and unified foreign policy amongst members; however, none of these proposals were implemented by the countries. The union was the first organization in Africa to bring together former colonies of the [[British West Africa|British]] and the [[French West Africa|French]].{{sfn|Howe|1959|p=A4}} Although the union was open to all independent states in Africa, no other states joined.{{sfn|Kihss|1966|p=12}} The union had a limited impact on politics as there was never any administration or permanent meetings to support the goals of unity. Its legacy was largely limited to longstanding political relationships between [[Kwame Nkrumah]] (President and Prime Minister of Ghana 1957‚Äì1966), [[Ahmed S√©kou Tour√©]] (President of Guinea 1958‚Äì1984), and [[Modibo Ke√Øta]] (President of Mali 1960‚Äì1968).  The union again came into the news when Nkrumah was named as the co-president of Guinea after he was deposed as President of Ghana by a military coup in 1966.{{sfn|DeLancey|1966|p=35}}{{sfn|Boston Globe|1966|p=1}}

==Background==
[[File:Kwame Nkrumah (JFKWHP-AR6409-A).jpg|thumbnail|left|Kwame Nkrumah, first President of Ghana and major leader in the Union of African States]]
The colonies of Guinea, the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (which became Ghana), and [[French Sudan]] (which became Mali) followed different paths toward [[Decolonization of Africa|decolonization]]. French Sudan and Guinea were both French colonies and thus after the [[May 1958 crisis]] were given the chance to vote for immediate independence or to join a reorganized [[French Community]] (which would grant domestic autonomy while maintaining French defense and economic policy). Guinea was the only French colony in Africa to vote for full independence in 1958. French Sudan voted to join the French Community.{{sfn|Kurtz|1970|p=405}} The Gold Coast, in contrast, was a British colony which achieved independence as Ghana in March 1957 and joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].{{sfn|Washington Post|1959|p=A16}}

The differences continued into the post-independence era. The French government, with urging from the [[Ivory Coast]], began a complete withdrawal of French personnel from Guinea and a suspension of aid when the country declared independence. This resulted in economic turmoil throughout the country and sent a warning against independence for the other colonies.{{sfn|Washington Post|1959|p=A16}} French Sudan joined with [[Senegal]] to form the [[Mali Federation]] for a few months in 1960. However, political intractability led to the dissolution of the Mali Federation in August 1960.{{sfn|Foltz|1965|pp=182-183}} Ghana, in contrast, was presented as a success story of the decolonization period in Africa with a booming economy and the recognition from international organizations for its astute fiscal management.{{sfn|Howe|1959|p=A4}}

Despite these differences, the leaders of the three countries shared a common vision of Africa's future. Kwame Nkrumah, Ahmed S√©kou Tour√©, and Modibo Ke√Øta were each pivotal anti-colonial figures in their countries and the first leaders after independence.  In addition, each became prominent in the [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African]] movement and were architects in developing a theory of [[African socialism]].{{sfn|DeLancey|1966|pp=35-36}}{{refn|Historian [[John Donnelly Fage]] categorizes the three leaders together as the "radical West African leaders" in the independence era.{{sfn|Fage|1969|p=219}}}}

In November 1958, with the sudden cessation of French aid and personnel for Guinea, Nkrumah and Tour√© met in [[Conakry]], the capital of Guinea, to discuss an emergency loan which Ghana was going to provide to Guinea.{{sfn|Fage|1969|p=217}} On 23 November, the two leaders announced a plan for the creation of a union of African states which the two leaders would work towards over a series of meetings with the loan as the first of many steps towards integration.{{sfn|Brandful|2013|p=121}} Following these negotiations, the Union of Independent African States (UIAS) was declared on 1 May 1959.{{sfn|Brady|1959|p=4}} The agreement was very loose, only requiring that the members work together on relations with other African countries and thus was, in the words of journalist [[Russel Warren Howe]], more pragmatic than ambitious.{{sfn|Howe|1959|p=A4}} They declared intentions for developing a shared currency (a union bank and union economic council were planned){{sfn|Brady|1959|p=4}} and shared citizenship, but did not include unified defense or foreign policy provisions in regards to countries outside of Africa.{{sfn|Howe|1959|p=A4}} Despite these declarations, little happened to cement any shared currency or create unified citizenship between the two countries in 1958 or 1959. The only significant effect of the union was the ¬£10 million (about ¬£{{Format price|{{Inflation|GBP|10000000|1958}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|UK}}) loan provided by Ghana to Guinea.{{sfn|Boston Globe|1966|p=1}}{{sfn|Fage|1969|p=217}}{{sfn|Brandful|2013|p=121}} However, even this relationship was hesitantly agreed to by the members. Guinea used less than half of the funds provided by Ghana despite its continued economic problems.{{sfn|Kloman Jr.|1962|p=390}}{{sfn|Legum|1965|p=76}}

In November 1960, following the tense end of the Mali Federation in August, talks begun between the two original members with Mali to join an expanded union.{{sfn|Chicago Defender|1961|p=4}} These negotiations reached fruition on 1 July 1961 when the charter of the newly named Union of African States was published simultaneously in the capitals of the three members.{{sfn|Washington Post|1961|p=A9}} The charter of the union provided for [[collective security]] (the agreement that an attack on any of the three countries would be an attack on all) and shared diplomatic, economic, educational, and cultural activities.{{sfn|Kloman Jr.|1962|p=390}}{{sfn|Washington Post|1961|p=A9}} The union remained loose but the leaders believed it would set the ground for a larger and stronger union between members. At the signing ceremony on 1 July, Nkrumah declared that the union would be "a nucleus of a United States of Africa".{{sfn|Washington Post|1961|p=A9}} Diplomatically, the union became a key part of the [[Casablanca group]] and the three members agreed to push for similar policy issue within that forum.{{sfn|Kloman Jr.|1962|p=391}} Similarly, the leaders approached Cold War politics in a similar manner, promoting a pro-Soviet involvement in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].{{sfn|Boston Globe|1966|p=2}} Although Mali and Ghana had discussed creating a shared parliament, such a provision was not contained in the final agreement.{{sfn|New York Times|1961|p=9}} Other issues, such as the creation of a single flag for all three countries, a unified economic policy, a unified foreign policy, and the development of a common constitution were mentioned but not provided with details and were to be worked out by regular meetings of the three leaders.{{sfn|Boston Globe|1966|p=2}}{{sfn|New York Times|1961|p=9}}{{refn|Although no common flag was decided on by the members in this declaration, a flag for the union was decided to be based on the Ghanan flag, but "with as many black stars as there are members".{{sfn|McKown|1973|p=124}}}} No administration was ever established and the only regular governance of the union was set to be meetings between the three leaders of the members.{{sfn|Kloman Jr.|1962|p=390}}

The union was confronted by a series of significant problems from its establishment.  Ghana was separated from Guinea by the countries of the Ivory Coast and [[Sierra Leone]] and separated from Mali by the country of [[Republic of Upper Volta|Upper Volta]].{{sfn|Boston Globe|1966|p=2}}{{refn|This geographic division between the countries was emphasized in the 1 July ceremonies which included the first [[radiotelephone]] call between Mali and Guinea, but did not include Ghana because the connections were not yet constructed to enable such a transmission.{{sfn|Washington Post|1961|p=A9}}}} Attempts to bridge this gap by including Upper Volta in the union failed, despite a number of overtures by Nkrumah.{{sfn|Kloman Jr.|1962|p=390}} In one meeting between [[Maurice Yam√©ogo]], the president of Upper Volta, and Nkrumah the two pledged to work together toward "effective unity of Africa" and together knocked down a wall constructed specifically for the ceremony.{{sfn|Legum|1965|p=76}} Similarly, although Mali and Guinea share a border, there had been little creation of significant transportation infrastructure between the countries (both of them being more significantly linked to Senegal during the colonial period). Another problem was that the countries had separate linguistic and colonial infrastructures which limited the space for any significant policy unification.{{sfn|Boston Globe|1966|p=2}}{{sfn|Washington Post|1959|p=A16}} In addition, although the parties agreed on many foreign policy goals, they were divided about [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] in 1960 and 1961. Finally, although the agreement was open to all African states, suspicion about Nkrumah and regional politics between the three leaders and [[F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny]] in the Ivory Coast limited the union's expansion.{{sfn|Kihss|1966|p=12}}

The economic council never got started and only a few meetings were held between the three leaders. Tensions increased between the members in 1963 with the [[1963 Togolese coup d'√©tat]]: Nkrumah was accused of having supported the coup. In the preparation for the Addis Ababa summit to found the [[Organization of African Unity]], Tour√© was upset with Nkrumah for pursuing an agenda without consultation of the other members.  The union was dissolved without much attention in May 1963.{{sfn|DeLancey|1966|p=35}}{{sfn|Brandful|2013|pp=121-122}}{{sfn|Legum|1965|pp=76-77}}

==Legacy==
[[File:Predsednik republike Mali Modibo Keita s spremstvom v Tovarni avtomobilov in motorjev Maribor 1961.jpg|thumbnail|Modibo Ke√Øta, the first President of Mali]]
The political alliance between the three leaders was the most significant legacy of the union. Ghana, Guinea, and Mali remained tightly connected until Nkrumah was removed from power by a military coup in 1966. As an example of this continuing relationship, the Ghanaian ambassador to Mali retained the title of "Resident Minister" even after the political union had dissolved.{{sfn|Brandful|2013|p=122}}

The union again became important in 1966 when Nkrumah was removed as the President of Ghana by a military coup while he was in China dealing with peace talks about the Vietnam war.{{sfn|Kihss|1966|p=12}} After the coup, he returned to Guinea where he was greeted ceremoniously by Tour√© and the latter declared that Nkrumah was now the head of state of Guinea and the Secretary General of the [[Democratic Party of Guinea ‚Äì African Democratic Rally|Democratic Party of Guinea]].{{sfn|Boston Globe|1966|p=1}}{{sfn|DeLancey|1966|p=35}} Tour√© declared that "If there were a conference of African heads of state tomorrow, Comrade Nkrumah would speak in the name of Guinea, because Nkrumah is not a simple African but a universal man."{{sfn|New York Times|1966|p=1}} The U.S. State Department was incredulous at the time about whether this naming of Nkrumah as president of the country was genuine{{sfn|New York Times|1966|p=12}} and the declaration of Nkrumah as the co-president of Guinea with Tour√© is often considered to be an honorific title.{{sfn|Lipschutz|1989|p=176}}{{sfn|van Sertima|1988|p=331}}

The '''White Terror in Hungary''' was a two-year period (1919&amp;ndash;1921) of repressive violence by [[counter-revolutionary]] soldiers, carried out to crush any opposition supportive of Hungary‚Äôs [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|short-lived Soviet republic]] and its [[Hungarian Red Terror|Red Terror]]. Many of the victims of the White Terror were Jewish.&lt;ref name="Braham2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Randolph L. Braham|title=The Nazis' Last Victims: The Holocaust in Hungary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X3lrJHcsY9sC&amp;pg=PA30|year=2002|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0-8143-3095-1|pages=30‚Äì31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TuckerWood1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Spencer Tucker|author2=Laura Matysek Wood|title=The European powers in the First World War: an encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHI3PCjDtsUC&amp;pg=PA349|year=1996|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8153-0399-2|pages=349‚Äì350}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the White Terror, tens of thousands were imprisoned without trial and as many as 1,000 people were killed.

==Background==
At the end of [[First World War|World War I]], the political configuration of the Hungarian state was forced into swift and radical change. The [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], of which Hungary had been a powerful member, collapsed. The victorious [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] powers took steps to carve out Hungary‚Äôs ethnically mixed border regions and grant them to the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] ‚Äì efforts which resulted in Hungary‚Äôs losing two thirds of its land area, and one third of its Hungarian-speaking nationals. These losses together with the postwar socioeconomic upheaval catalysed deep feelings of humiliation and resentment among many Hungarians.&lt;ref name="Braham2002"/&gt;

In this volatile atmosphere, the nation‚Äôs fledgling efforts to form a single stable government failed. In March 1919, a government of communists, taking over from a Social Democrat-Communist coalition, established the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]. The [[Hungarian Communist Party|Communist Party of Hungary]], led by [[B√©la Kun]], had the most influence in the republic, although the government was ostensibly led by the Social Democratic-Communist coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Balogh, Eva, ''Istvan Friedrich and the Hungarian Coup d'Etat of 1919: A Reevaluation'', [[Slavic Review]], Vol. 35, No. 2 (Jun., 1976), pp. 269-286&lt;/ref&gt; Kun‚Äôs government lasted less than four months, eventually ending upon the Romanian invasion. During this period, heightened political tension and suppression led to arrests and executions in what came to be known as the [[Red Terror (Hungary)|Red Terror]]. This led to a lowering in support of the government. Hungary attempted to retain Slovakia and [[Transylvania]], but Romanian troops [[Hungarian‚ÄìRomanian War of 1919|invaded]] Hungary, eventually reaching Budapest in August 1919. Upon the invasion, most Hungarian communists, including Kun, went in exile.

==First phase (1919)==
In the south of the country, an alternative government formed to replace the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Leading the armed wing of this new government, the "[[Royal Hungarian Army|National Army]]", was [[Mikl√≥s Horthy]], one-time [[Admiral]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bodo, Bela, ''Paramilitary Violence in Hungary After the First World War'', East European Quarterly, June 22, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the officers who answered Horthy‚Äôs call were ultra-nationalist soldiers who mounted a campaign of atrocities in a retaliation to the [[Red Terror (Hungary)|Red Terror]]; to eliminate communist supporters and frighten the population into obedience to the new order.&lt;ref name="Bodo, Paramilitary Violence"&gt;Bodo, ''Paramilitary Violence''&lt;/ref&gt;

The pogroms and mass murders were carried out by units of the "National Army" commanded by Mih√°ly Horthy; paramilitary organisations also committed killings, especially the "Hungarian Awakening".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bBBMIxSCQZMC&amp;pg=PA887&amp;dq=white+terror+hungary+victims&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3numgvavTAhVJJsAKHYuGCxcQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20terror%20hungary%20victims&amp;f=false|title=Austria - Hungary - Poland - Russia|last=Strauss|first=Herbert A.|date=1993-01-01|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=|isbn=9783110883299|location=|pages=887|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These units, commonly known as the "White Guard," carried out a campaign of murder, torture and humiliations. Summary executions of people they suspected of communist allegiance were common; these victims were often hanged in public places to serve as a warning to others. But the White Guard‚Äôs definition of who was an enemy of the state was a broad one. They also preyed upon peasants, upon the politically liberal, and very often upon [[Jew]]s, who were broadly blamed for the revolution because much of the communist leadership had been Jewish.&lt;ref name="Bodo, Paramilitary Violence"/&gt;

The most notorious of unit commanders was [[P√°l Pr√≥nay]], whose battalion engaged in sadistic violence against its enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodo|first=Bela|date=2011|title=The White Terror in Hungary, 1919-1921: The Social Worlds of Paramilitary Groups|url=|journal=Austrian History Yearbook|volume=42|pages=156|doi=10.1017/S0067237811000099|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others included Gyula Ostenberg, [[Anton Leh√°r]], and Ivan Hejjas, who focused his efforts on the Hungarian plain around the town of [[Kecskem√©t|Kecsk√©met]]. Their detachments were part of the National Army, but tended to function as personal battalions following a fanatical loyalty to their commanders.&lt;ref name="Bodo, Paramilitary Violence"/&gt; Their atrocities included torture, rape, summary execution, and desecration of the corpses for public display.&lt;ref&gt;Bodo, "The White Terror in Hungary," 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardest hit were the regions of [[Transdanubia]], the wider area of Horthy's headquarters in [[Si√≥fok]], and in the lowlands between the [[Danube]] and the [[Tisza|Theiss]] rivers, where mass murders which aroused international attention were committed in Kecsk√©met and [[Orgov√°ny]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Second phase (post-1919)==
The National Army invaded [[Budapest]] in November 1919, and four months later Horthy became [[Regent of Hungary|Regent]] of the newly established [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920‚Äì46)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. But, far from discontinuing their campaigns, the reactionary units expanded and continued terrorising their targets for almost two more years; politically motivated violence devolved into grudge-murders and kidnappings for profit. White Guard officers began to vie for power among themselves, and plotted for one another‚Äôs assassinations.&lt;ref name="Bodo, Paramilitary Violence"/&gt; Horthy‚Äôs biographer, [[Thomas L. Sakmyster]], concluded that Horthy looked the other way in 1919 while the White Guard officers raged through the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Sakmyster | first = Thomas L. | authorlink = Thomas L. Sakmyster | title = Miklos Horthy: Hungary‚Äôs Admiral on Horseback | publisher = Columbia University Press | date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the White Terror==
By 1920 the terror receded noticeably.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1921, P√°l Pr√≥nay was prosecuted for crimes related to the White Terror. After Pr√≥nay joined a failed attempt to restore the Habsburg king, [[Charles I of Austria]] to Hungary‚Äôs throne, his battalion was disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;Bodo, Political Violence&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the disbandment of the Pr√≥nay battalion, in subsequent years sporadic attacks occurred.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Around 1977, Kadi earned a bachelor's degree in architectural engineering from Alexandria University in Cairo, Egypt,{{sfn|staff|p=4}} and subsequently became an intern at the architectural firm [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] in Chicago from July 1979 to February 1981.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune-money-trail" /&gt;  He helped the firm develop a master plan and contract documentation for the Mecca Campus of the [[King Abdulaziz University]].&lt;ref&gt;Yassin Abdullah Kadi, Claimant, and HM Treasury, Defendant, In the High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, Administrative Court, In the Matter of Yassin Abdullah Kadi, CO/4528/01 and CO/4532/01, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/18487799/Petition-175 Petition 175], page 3, footnote 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kadi inherited "several million dollars" in 1988.&lt;ref name="wsj-well-connected" /&gt; In 1990, he began to establish close business associations with Saudi billionaire [[Khalid bin Mahfouz]], whose family owned a majority interest in Saudi Arabia's largest bank, the [[National Commercial Bank]].  Kadi said that he was brought in to maintain good financial relations with pious Muslims throughout the Islamic world, by building a more [[shariah]]-compliant banking network for the bank.  "We devised systems of leasing and ways to borrow money" that could be used by pious Muslims, who are not allowed to charge interest, Kadi told the ''Chicago Tribune''.&lt;ref name="jackson-cohen-manor-money-trail"&gt;David Jackson, Laurie Cohen and Robert Manor, "[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/sns-worldtrade-kadi-ct,0,1961940.story?page=1 U.S.: Money Trail Leads to Saudi: Financier Denies Sending Funds to Bin Laden,]" Chicago Tribune, 29 October 2001, posted on LA Times website&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1992, Kadi created the Muwafaq Foundation, an Islamic charity incorporated for the stated purpose of providing famine relief and education in the Islamic world, particularly Pakistan.&lt;ref name="johnson-clifton-bio-stmt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;Pallister, David and Jamie Wilson.

They said "if it was structured as a financial trust, it would not require to be registered at all."&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;  Kadi personally donated about $15 to $20 million from his fortune, and solicited donations from bin Mahfouz and other wealthy Saudi families.&lt;ref name="jackson-cohen-manor-money-trail"/&gt;  Bin Mahfouz became a principal donor but later said that he was not involved in the operation of the charity after its establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Bin Mahfouz Family, "[http://www.binmahfouz.info/faqs_2.html What was the connection between Khalid bin Mahfouz and the Blessed Relief charity?]" FAQ Tab, The Events of 11 September 2001 and Their Aftermath, Bin Mahfouz Information website&lt;/ref&gt;

A similarly named organization, the "Muwaffaq Society" or "Muwaffaq Ltd.," was registered in the Isle of Man in June 1991, but Kadi denied any relationship to this entity.{{sfn|staff|loc=page 10, paragraph 17.2}} Plaintiffs who have filed suit against Kadi and his associates claim that Muwafaq was a charitable front used to funnel money to al-Qaeda, an allegation Mr Kadi has repeatedly denied.&lt;ref name="burr-collins-alms"&gt;Burr, J. Millard and Robert O. Collins, ''Alms for Jihad: Charity and Terrorism in the Islamic World'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp. 121-123.  The authors claim that the Muwafaq Foundation opened an office in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1992, at a time when al-Qaeda was assisting militants fighting U.S. soldiers there, and "its purpose [there] consisted of transporting weapons and ammunition to Islamists in the city."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cohen|first=Laurie |date=2001-10-16 |title=Assets frozen, Saudi businessman demands evidence |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-0110160282oct16-story.html |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |access-date=2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business activity after 2001===
According to Victor D. Comras, "Al Kadi is believed to have acted swiftly after 9/11 to restructure many of his business interests and, while retaining actual control, placed many of his own assets into the hands of nominal managers and directors."&lt;ref name="comras-flawed-diplomacy"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iB_rdh_udG4C&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=Victor+D.+Comras+Yasin+al+Qadi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jFDiWfpO93&amp;sig=a2NXoZHD8aV7CO-8_XYHa87uw9g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_A81UOz0M6S1ygH72ICAAg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Victor%20D.%20Comras%20Yasin%20al%20Qadi&amp;f=false Comras, Victor D.

==Terrorism blacklist==

===Meetings with Osama bin Laden===
In an October 2001 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Kadi said that he met with Osama bin Laden at religious gatherings in the 1980s, but "he said the encounters were unremarkable at a time when bin Laden's battle against the Soviets in Afghanistan attracted US government support and donations from Mosques around the United States."&lt;ref name="chicagotribune-money-trail" /&gt;

In a December 2008 interview with the New York Times, Kadi added that he once met Osama bin Laden in Chicago. He gives the date as 1981.&lt;ref name="nytimes-mired-limbo quote"&gt;"Qadi told the Times that Bin Laden "came to Chicago to recruit American-trained engineers for his family‚Äôs construction business. As Mr. Kadi remembers it, he put Mr. bin Laden in touch with a group of engineers, several of whom were eventually hired." Thomas Jr., Landon "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/13/world/middleeast/13kadi.html?pagewanted=all A Wealthy Saudi, Mired in Limbo over an Accusation of Terrorism]," New York Times, 12 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Coll, a biographer of the Bin Laden family&lt;ref&gt;Coll, Steven, ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Bin_Ladens.html?id=M8dSD-CQOTYC The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century]'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; discovered that the date of the visit was 1979.

The date coincides with Kadi's arrival in Chicago in July 1979.

===1991: Loan Linked to Hamas===
In 1991, Kadi loaned $820,000 to the Quranic Literacy Institute (QLI) of Oak Lawn, IL, a group formed to disseminate the Koran and Muslim texts but later allegedly linked to Hamas. Kadi told the Chicago Tribune he made the loan because of his friendship with the literacy institute's president, whom he met at a Sunday lecture in the Chicago area.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune-money-trail"/&gt;

Kadi said the money was intended to allow the institute to make a land investment, which would yield profits that would support its charitable work.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune-money-trail"/&gt;

=== 1998: Funds Al-Iman University ===
In 1998, Kadi donated money toward the construction of housing for students at Al-Iman University in Sanaa, Yemen.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"January ‚Äì August 1998: Saudi Businessman pays money to Al Qaeda front," History Commons website, citing Wall Street Journal&lt;/ref&gt; The university‚Äôs name is also translated as [[Iman University]] or Al-Eman.

===January - August 1998: Linked to Maram===
According to Glenn R.

"Terror Probe Follows the Money: Investigators Say Bank Records Link Saudi Investor to al Qaeda" Wall Street Journal, 2 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Founded as a travel agency and import-export business, the company Maram was reportedly established by [[Mamdouh Mahmud Salim]], said to be one of al-Qaeda‚Äôs founding members and to have a history of moving money and shopping for weapons for the organization.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[http://www.historycommons.org/searchResults.jsp?searchtext=al-Qadi&amp;events=on&amp;entities=on&amp;articles=on&amp;topics=on&amp;timelines=on&amp;projects=on&amp;titles=on&amp;descriptions=on&amp;dosearch=on&amp;search=Go#events History Commons] website citing Douglas Frantz,"Front Companies Seen to Keep Financing Terrorists," New York Times, 19 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months later, in December 1998, Kadi reportedly transferred shares in the company to two other men. One was Wael Hamza Julaidan, a Saudi businessman said to be a founder of al-Qaeda (the US officially designated Julaidan a financial supporter of al-Qaeda in 2002). The other was reported to be Mohammed Bayazid, another alleged founder of al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

On 12 October 2001 Kadi was listed as one of several dozen individuals that the United States "determined to have committed or to pose a significant risk of committing or providing material support for acts of terrorism" under Executive Order 13224.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://fas.org/irp/news/2002/10/dos101102.html Fact Sheet: Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, U.S. Department of State, October 11, 2002]" reproduced at FAS.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State, Chronology, The Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, "[http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/terrorOrgsID.pdf Comprehensive List of Terrorists and Groups Identified under Executive Order 13224]," 31 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; His U.S. assets were frozen.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Treasury "[http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/po689.aspx Treasury Department Releases List of 39 Additional Specially Designated Global Terrorists]," 12 October 2001, Press Center page, Treasury Department website&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 October, OFAC sent a letter to Kadi notifying him of his rights to request reconsideration.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Office of Management and Budget, OMB Watch Timeline of Kadi Litigation in EU and U.S. "[http://www.charityandsecurity.org/litigation/Kadi_Timeline The Kadi Case: Court Decisions on Due Process for Terror Listing Differ in EU, U.S,]"  3 April 2012, Charity &amp; Security Network website&lt;/ref&gt; Kadi was added to the UN list shortly afterward, which also resulted in his assets being frozen in [[European Union]] countries. Saudi Arabia "supported the addition of the Jeddah-based terrorist financier, Yasin al-Qadi, to the UN's consolidated list in October 2001," according to an official press release of the U.S. Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Office of Public Affairs, U.S. Department of Treasury, "[http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/js1108.aspx Treasury Announces Joint Action with Saudi Arabia Against Four Branches of Al Haramain in the Fight Against Terrorist Financing]," 22 January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="federal-register-blocked-2001"&gt;Federal Register, [https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2001/10/26/01-27076/blocked-persons-specially-designated-nationals-specially-designated-terrorists-foreign-terrorist Alphabetical List of Blocked Persons], U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Not found guilty of anything"===
Yassin Kadi was never formally charged with a crime by the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. "As is customary in such cases, Washington has presented no direct evidence linking Mr. Kadi to terrorism," the New York Times reported in 2008. "But it has made public a dense labyrinth of associations and business and personal ties that it says establishes Mr. Kadi‚Äôs relationship with Mr. bin Laden and his allies."&lt;ref name="nytimes-mired-limbo" /&gt;

"We have not found Mr. Kadi guilty of anything," Adam J. Szubin, director of OFAC, told the Times. "But we have found that he is a supporter of terror."&lt;ref name="nytimes-mired-limbo"/&gt;

"The post-911 credo became one of pre-emption and acting on suspicion," says Marieke DeGoede in her 2012 book ''Speculative Security:  The Politics of Pursuing Terrorist Monies''. OFAC uses its new powers to freeze assets "during the pendancy of an investigation," which means, effectively, that the government is able to stop the operations of charities suspected of being terrorist fronts "without any formal determination of wrongdoing."&lt;ref&gt;DeGoede, Marieke. ''Speculative Security: The Politics of Pursuing Terrorist Monies'' (University of Minnesota Press, 2012) p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Kadi, who has repeatedly claimed that he has given no support to terrorism, told the Times that the result was a legal paradox.  When no criminal charge has been brought and the evidence on which the charges are based has been classified, "there is no way to defend yourself."&lt;ref name="nytimes-mired-limbo"/&gt;

Kadi denied all the allegations as totally untrue. "I don‚Äôt have any connection, be it close or distant, with Al-Qaeda or its leader Bin Laden, either directly or indirectly," he told Asharq Al-Awsat, a sister publication of Arab News, in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;Ghafour, P.K. Abdul "[http://www.arabnews.com/node/255770 Yassin Al-Qadi Wins Case Against Swiss Prosecutor,]" Arab News, 26 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal action==

===December 2001: Appeals listing and asset freeze===
In December 2001, Kadi filed a challenge to the EU listing and asset freeze in the European Court of First Instance (General Court).  His appeal was based on a claim that he had been denied fundamental due process.&lt;ref name="omb-watch-timeline"&gt;OMB Watch Timeline of Kadi Litigation in EU and U.S. "The Kadi Case: Court Decisions on Due Process for Terror Listing Differ in EU, U.S," 3 April 2012, Charity &amp; Security Network website&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, he also petitioned the U.S. Department of Treasury (OFAC) for reconsideration of his listing and asset freeze.&lt;ref name="omb-watch-timeline" /&gt;

===Move to Turkey===
After 11 September 2001, Yassin Kadi moved many of his operations to Istanbul, Turkey and Switzerland. ''Forbes'' reported that Kadi is a friend of Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdogan]].&lt;ref name="Forbes2008-01-24"&gt;

On 5 October 2012, the [http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/10/05/united-nations-removes-saudi-businessman-from-blacklist/?test=latestnews UN Security Council] committee monitoring sanctions removed Kadi from its blacklist as a suspected financier of Al-Queda.

===November 2002: Defendant in 911 lawsuit===
On 15 August 2002, firefighters, rescue workers and more than 600 relatives of victims of the [[September 11 attacks]] filed a $116 trillion lawsuit against Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Bin Laden Group, three Saudi princes, the government of Sudan, seven international banks, eight Islamic foundations, charities and subsidiaries, and many other defendants.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Susan "September 11 families join to sue Saudis," Washington Post, 16 August 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;CNN "$116 trillion lawsuit filed by 9/11 families," 15 August 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kellman, Laurie "More than 600 Sept. 11 victims' families sue Saudis, banks," Associated Press, 15 August 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Kadi was added to the list of defendants on 22 November 2002, along with 50 more people and organizations, bringing the total number of defendants to 186.&lt;ref&gt;Geyelin, Milo.

===March 2004: Delisting request denied by OFAC===
On 12 March 2004, OFAC issued a 20-page unclassified memorandum denying Kadi‚Äôs request for reconsideration.&lt;ref name="The Kadi Case 2012"&gt;OMB Watch Timeline of Kadi Litigation in EU and U.S. "The Kadi Case: Court Decisions on Due Process for Terror Listing Differ in EU, U.S,"  3 April 2012, Charity &amp; Security Network website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kadi-v-paulson-opinion"&gt;{{ cite book|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |title=Kadi v. Paulson et al, Civil Action No. 09-0108 (JDB), Document 56 Memorandum Opinion, 19 March 2012, citing "OFAC Memorandum" of March 2004 |first=John D. |last=Bates|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_09-cv-00108/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_09-cv-00108-0.pdf|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It determined that Kadi played "a significant leadership role" in the Muwafaq ("Blessed Success") Foundation, as one of six trustees, and the others "delegated . . . the running and the operation of the Foundation" to Kadi, who "was the driving force behind the administration of the foundation." He "effectively conceded that he directly supervised the individual country offices."{{sfn|Bates|p=16}} OFAC relied on Kadi's involvement in Muwafaq and, in particular, activities claimed to have occurred in Bosnia, Albania, Sudan and Pakistan, to conclude that "Kadi financially supported terrorist activities, primarily through Muwafaq, but also through other Kadi-owned entities." It considered Kadi's "relationship with and financial transfers to, designated terrorists Abdul Latif Saleh, Wa'el Julaidan, and Chariq Ayadi -- who were all involved in Muwafaq."{{sfn|Bates|p=16}}

According to OFAC's findings, "Muwafaq gave logistical and financial support to Al-Gama'at Al-Islamiya, a mujahadin battalion in Bosnia that was designated as SGDT on October 31, 2001. The organization also transferred $500,000 to terrorist organizations in the Balkans in the mid-1990s."{{sfn|Bates|p=17}} OFAC found that Muwafaq "was involved in arms trafficking from Albania to Bosnia," and concluded that "as of late 2001, Kadi had continued to finance institutions and organizations in the Balkans after Muwafaq had ceased operations there, including two entities that were designated as SDGTs in early 2002 -- the Revival of Islamic Heritage Society's Pakistan and Afghanistan offices, and the Bosnia-Herzegovina branch of the Al-Haramain Foundation."{{sfn|Bates|p=17}}

===September 2004: Complaint against Swiss prosecutor===
On 21 September 2004, the Swiss Federal Criminal Court ruled in Kadi's favor with regard to complaints brought by Kadi's lawyers against the Swiss prosecutor, Deputy Swiss Attorney General Claude Nicati. The Swiss court ordered that Kadi's lawyers be given full access to Nicati's entire file, including all notes taken by Nicati of his meeting with Jean-Charles Brisard.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Ghafour, P.K. Abdul "Yassin Al-Qadi Wins Case Against Swiss Prosecutor," Arab News, 24 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

"Brisard is the lead investigator for the US lawyers in the civil action brought in the US courts on behalf of the families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and cannot therefore be regarded as independent," his lawyers said. "Of particular concern to Al-Qadi was his discovery that Brisard passed to US lawyers documents he received from Nicati‚Äôs file in his capacity as expert."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

On 27 March 2006, an extraordinary prosecutor appointed to investigate the matter concluded that Kadi's allegations were baseless and dismissed the action, finding that there was no evidence that Brisard or his assistants had improperly passed on information to Nicati.&lt;ref&gt;Brisard, Jean-Charles.

===September 2005: EU denies request for delisting===
In September 2005, the EU Court of First Instance (General Court) denied Kadi‚Äôs appeal, saying that compliance with EU law need not be considered because the UN Security Council has primacy. Kadi appealed to the EU Court of Justice.&lt;ref name="The Kadi Case 2012"/&gt;

===December 2005: Wins case in Switzerland===
The Federal Criminal Court in Berne, Switzerland, "cleared Al-Qadi of any wrongdoing in a case stemming from the 9/11 attacks," his lawyers announced on 12 December 2005. The charges had alleged that Kadi gave money in 1998 ostensibly to construct student housing at Al-Iman University in Yemen while knowing that the funds may have ended up supporting Al-Qaeda‚Äôs plan to attack New York City.&lt;ref name="Mirza 2005"&gt;Mirza, Abdul Maqsood "Saudi Execs Praise Swiss Decision in Al-Qadi Case," Arab News, 25 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

"I am very happy to know that my friend Al-Qadi has been cleared of all charges by the Swiss court," [[Zuhair Hamed Fayez|Zuhair Fayez]], a Jeddah-based architect, told Arab News on 25 December. He described Kadi as a reputable businessman and said the individuals and agencies that falsely accused Kadi of funding terrorism must be held responsible for damaging his reputation and interests.&lt;ref name="Mirza 2005"/&gt;

===December 2007: Delisted by Switzerland===
On 13 December 2007, based on the results of its own six-year investigation, a Swiss court removed Kadi from the country's list of blocked terrorists.  [[Arab News]] reported that Kadi was exonerated "on all charges" and said that his money in Swiss banks and the Geneva-based Faisal bank would be unfrozen.&lt;ref name="Ghafour, P.K. Abdul 2007"/&gt; Switzerland is not a member of the European Union and therefore had no obligation to comply with the EU listing.&lt;ref name="The Kadi Case 2012" /&gt;

===September 2008: EU Court of Justice rules in favor of Kadi===
In 2008 the [[European Court of Justice]] overturned sanctions against Kadi by individual [[European Union]] governments, on the grounds the EU nations had not offered those sanctioned a chance for the judicial review of their matter.&lt;ref name=AssociatedPress2008-10-22/&gt;

On 3 September 2008, the EU Court of Justice (higher court) ruled in favor of Kadi, "saying UN agreements cannot have the effect of prejudicing constitutional principles agreed to in the treaty establishing the European Community. The court found the EU regulation allowing listing and asset freezes to breach fundamental human rights, since no evidence was communicated to Kadi, and the right of defence and effective judicial review were prejudiced. It gave EU authorities three months to remedy these defects, leaving the sanctions in place during that time."&lt;ref name="The Kadi Case 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Posch, Albert "[http://www.cjel.net/online/15_2-posch/ The Kadi Case: Rethinking The Relationship Between EU Law and International Law?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231151342/http://www.cjel.net/online/15_2-posch |date=31 December 2012 }}" 15 Colum.

According to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, none of the bodies that have sanctioned Kadi have made public any of the evidence upon which the sanctions were and continued to be based.&lt;ref name=Forbes2008-01-24 /&gt;

On 22 October 2008, [[Martin Scheinin]], in a report to the [[United Nations Security Council]], suggested greater openness and transparency for making known the reasons individuals and organizations were being sanctioned.&lt;ref name=AssociatedPress2008-10-22/&gt;
He stated:
:{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|
:"Leaving things as they are at the U.N. level ... is the least preferred option, as it would result in a wave of litigation and the credibility of the overall United Nations counterterrorism framework would be at risk."

=== November 2008: EU Commission renews listing and asset freeze ===
In October 2008, the EU Commission (sanctions agency) provided to Kadi‚Äôs attorneys a brief summary of the UN‚Äôs reasons for listing Kadi, and they gave Kadi an opportunity for comment. On 28 November 2008, the EU Commission renewed its listing and assets freeze against Kadi.&lt;ref name="The Kadi Case 2012"/&gt;

===December 2008: Partially delisted by UK Treasury===
In December 2008, the UK Treasury removed Yassin Kadi from its list of persons designated as terrorists under its Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2001 (the "2001 Order"), but left him on a second list of persons designated as terrorists under separate UK legislation, the Al Qaeda and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 (the "2006 Order"), which contained different listing criteria.&lt;ref name="Yassin Abdullah Kadi v p. 2"&gt;Yassin Abdullah Kadi v.

According to his UK lawyers at [[Carter-Ruck]], "this delisting followed a comprehensive review by the UK Treasury of the case against Mr. Kadi, including a review of the materials which had been used to support Mr. Kadi's original designation, after which the UK Treasury concluded that "the case against (Mr. Kadi) no longer meets the test set out in ... the Terrorism Order."&lt;ref name="Yassin Abdullah Kadi v p. 2"/&gt;

===January 2009: Kadi v Timothy Geithner et al===
On 16 January 2009, Kadi filed suit against officers of the U.S. Department of Treasury (OFAC) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (''Yassin Abdullah Kadi v. Timothy Geithner et al.'', Civil Action No. 09-0108; and ''Kadi v. Paulson et al.'',  a request for agency decision review assigned to Judge John D. Bates, Case 28-1331).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Pacer

The lawsuit and request for agency review challenged Kadi‚Äôs designation as a terrorist and the asset freeze.

===February 2009: Second challenge to EU listing and EU freeze===
In February 2009, Kadi filed a new lawsuit with the EU General Court (formerly the Court of First Instance), challenging the EU‚Äôs 28 November 2008 decision to renew his listing and assets freeze.&lt;ref name="The Kadi Case 2012"/&gt;

===August 2009: UN clarifies reasons for listing Kadi===
On 13 August 2009, the United Nations Security Council Committee concerning Al-Qaida and associated individuals and entities (the "Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee") posted additional information and a narrative summary of their reasons for listing Yasin Abdullah Ezzeddine Kadi.&lt;ref name="unsc-narrative-summary"&gt;UN Security Council "[https://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/NSQI02201E.shtml Narrative Summary of Reasons for Listing: Yasin Abdullah Ezzedine Qadi]" Security Council Committee pursuant to resolutions
1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011) concerning Al-Qaida and associated individuals and entities, 13 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/NSQI02201E.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;  The reasons included:
*Kadi's acknowledgement of his role as founding trustee and director of the actions of the Muwafaq Foundation, a foundation which historically operated under the umbrella of the Makhtab al-Khidamat, an organization which was the predecessor of Al-Qaida and which was founded by Usama bin Ladin
*Kadi's decision in 1992 to hire Shafiq ben Mohamed ben Mohamed al-Ayadi as head the European offices of the Muwafaq Foundation
*The 1995 testimony of Talad Fuad Kassem, who said that the Muwafaq Foundation had provided logistical and financial support for a fighters‚Äô battalion in Bosnia and Herzegovina and that the Muwafaq Foundation was involved in providing financial support for terrorist activities of the fighters, as well as arms trafficking from Albania to Bosnia and Herzegovina
*Kadi's role as a major shareholder in the now closed Sarajevo-based Depositna Banka, where planning sessions for an attack against a United States facility in Saudi Arabia may have taken place
*Kadi's ownership of several firms in Albania which funneled money to extremists or employed extremists in positions where they controlled the firm‚Äôs funds
*Evidence that Bin Laden provided the working capital for up to five of Kadi‚Äôs companies in Albania.

Based on these reasons, the U.N. Security Council resolved to continue listing Yassin Kadi as a suspected supporter of al-Qaeda terrorists and the United States Department of Treasury has continued to classify Kadi as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist.

===January 2010: UK Supreme Court delists Kadi===
On 27 January 2010, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] (the highest appellate court for the UK) annulled the listing criteria of "the 2006 Order," the Al Qaeda and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006. In the case of ''[[Her Majesty's Treasury v Ahmed]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2010] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/2.html UKSC 2]&lt;/ref&gt; the court struck down the operative part of the legislation, and ruled that it must be quashed as being ''[[ultra vires]]'', or beyond the powers of the government which were conferred under the UK's [[United Nations Act 1946]], which allowed the UK to implement UN Security Council Resolutions.&lt;ref name="Yassin Abdullah Kadi v p. 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Alison. "[http://freelegalweb.org/6992/2010/02/case-comment-hm-treasury-v-ahmed-2010-uksc-2/ Case Comment: HM Treasury v Ahmed [2010&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; UKSC2]" FreeLegalWeb.org, syndicated from UKSC weblog, which "brings together barristers at Matrix Chambers, solicitors at Olswang LLP and wider contributions from academics and other interested parties to report the work of the UK Supreme Court in a suitably 21st century style."&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus Kadi's removal from a second UK list of persons designated as terrorists "was done as the result of the finding of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom that any such designation (as was done in Mr. Kadi's case in contravention of his fundamental rights) was illegal."&lt;ref name="Yassin Abdullah Kadi v p. 2"/&gt;

===September 2010: EU Court rules in Kadi‚Äôs favor, faults UN procedures===
On 30 September 2010, the EU General Court once again ruled in favor of Kadi, "noting that the UN procedure, despite improvements in the establishment of an Ombudsman Office to make recommendations on delisting requests,  lacks fundamental due process protections,  including sufficient notice of the charges and denying ‚Äòmost minimal access to the evidence against him.‚Äô" It said: "In essence the Security Council has still not deemed it appropriate to establish an independent and impartial body responsible for hearing ... decisions taken by the Sanctions Committee." (Paragraph 128).&lt;ref name="The Kadi Case 2012"/&gt;

According to Kadi's [[solicitor]]s at Carter-Ruck, the ruling had the effect of striking down the European asset-freezing regulation that was imposed on Kadi on 28 November 2008 after he had won his appeal to the European Court of Justice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Kadi was among nine defendants sued by the [[Lloyd's of London]] insurance syndicate on 8 September 2011 in a "landmark legal case against Saudi Arabia, accusing the kingdom of indirectly funding al-Qa'ida and demanding the repayment of ¬£136m [$215 million] it paid out to victims of the 9/11 attacks."&lt;ref&gt;Milmo, Cahal, "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/lloyds-insurer-sues-saudi-arabia-for-funding-911-attacks-2356857.html Lloyd's insurer sues Saudi Arabia for 'funding 9/11 attacks,]' " The Independent (UK), 19 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Pearson, Sophia, "Lloyd's Underwriters Sue Saudi Bank Over September 11 Claims," Bloomberg Business Week, 12 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcauley-lloyds"&gt;McAuley,Erin.

"Absent the sponsorship of al Qaeda‚Äôs material sponsors and supporters, including the defendants named herein, al Qaeda would not have possessed the capacity to conceive, plan and execute the September 11th attacks," according to the 154-page complaint.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Yassin Kadi is listed along with the following defendants:
*The Kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia]] (KSA)

===March 2012: U.S. Judge denies Kadi's motion to delist ===
On 19 March 2012, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed Kadi‚Äôs 2009 lawsuit against the officers of the U.S. Department of Treasury (OFAC). Judge John D. Bates brushed off Kadi's claim that OFAC "simply ignored" his explanation that Muwafaq was an organization engaged in charitable activities. Kadi had said the government believes Muwafaq is a front for bin Laden because [[USA Today]] reported that. "To the extent Kadi contends that newspaper articles cannot be relied upon by the government at all, that proposition is not well-grounded," Bates wrote. "As already stated, reliance on hearsay is plainly allowed. Furthermore, reliance on newspaper articles has been permitted to 'fill in evidentiary gaps when there is corroboration,' as well as to provide background information", Bates explained in his judgement.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2009cv00108/134774/56/0.pdf?ts=1376948974]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bates stated "the Court finds that this claim must be dismissed because (1) the bill of attainder clause does not apply to acts taken by a regulatory agency and (2) even if it did, the clause is not triggered here, because there was no action constituting 'punishment'".&lt;ref&gt;KADI v. PAULSON et al Civil Action No. 09-0108 (JDB) page 67 "[http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2009cv00108/134774/56/0.pdf?ts=1376948974]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===October 2012: UN Security Council delists Kadi ===
The U.N. Security Council created an independent ombudsman in 2009 to handle requests to get off the blacklist. The decision to delist Kadi came following his request for removal, according to a UN statement.

It stated that "after concluding its consideration of the delisting request submitted by this individual through the Ombudsperson established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1904 (2009), and after considering the Comprehensive Report of the Ombudsperson on this delisting request. Therefore, the assets freeze, travel ban and arms embargo set out in paragraph 1 of Security Council resolution 1989 (2011) no longer apply to the following individual."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2012/sc10785.doc.htm]"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== July 2013: European Court of Justice upholds annulment of terrorism designation ===
The European Commission, the European Council, and the United Kingdom appealed against the 2010 ruling of the EU General Court which had struck down the freezing of Kadi's European assets. The [[European Court of Human Rights|Grand Chamber]] of the Court of Justice of the European Union declined the appeal. According to Maya Lester, the decision hinged upon the court having gone through "each reason for the decision to re-list Yassin Kadi in 2008, and Mr Kadi‚Äôs evidence in response, and found none of the reasons to have been substantiated with evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://europeansanctions.com/2013/07/21/the-ecjs-judgment-in-kadi-ii/|title=THE ECJ‚Äôs JUDGMENT IN KADI II|last=Lester|first=Maya|date=21 July 2013|website=European Sanctions|publisher=|access-date=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court stated that "since no information or evidence has been produced to substantiate the allegations, roundly refuted by Mr. Al-Qadi, of his being involved in activities linked to international terrorism, those allegations are not such as to justify the adoption, at European Union level, of restrictive measures against him."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/news/458410|title=Court says EU wrongly froze assets of Saudi man|last=|first=|date=19 July 2013|website=|publisher=Arab News|access-date=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 2014: US Unblocks Property and Interests ===
On September 11, 2014, OFAC unblocked the property and interests in property of Yassin Kadi pursuant to E.O. 13224, "Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions With Persons Who Commit, Threaten To Commit, or Support Terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/12/05/2014-28598/unblocking-of-a-specially-designated-global-terrorist-pursuant-to-executive-order-13224|title=Federal Register - Unblocking of a Specially Designated Global Terrorist Pursuant to Executive Order 13224|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
