'''Adorján Czipleá''' (1639–1664) was a Hungarian [[Christian Kabbalist]] and [[mysticism|mystic]]. Not much is known about his life except for the fact that in 1662 – after some years of formal education in his native country – he journeyed to England in order to continue his [[philosophical]] and [[theological]] studies. There is no knowledge regarding the circumstances of his death, which occurred within two years after his arrival.

While in England, Czipleá wrote a controversial short treatise entitled ''De ente et malo'' (''On Being and Evil'') which circulated among a narrow group of prominent European intellectuals including, among others, [[Henry More]], [[Joseph Glanvill]], [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] and [[Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont]]. Although this work appears to be lost, records of its radical views (indictable for heresy at the time) survived in contemporary accounts of it. Probably the most detailed of these accounts is found in [[Méric Casaubon]]'s letter to [[Edward Stillingfleet]], dated September 1670:

{{Quotation|One such queer scholar was Mr. Adorján Czipleá, who held that the fallen angels did nevertheless not fall from Being since they possesse the attribute of intelligence which is, according to Plato, equivalente to that of existence. From this he deriv'd the preposterous idea that the first emanation, or Intelligence, or Being, is compromis'd withe the fallen ones: ''esse (sive intellectus) est diabolus''. Being is thus always torn, in perpetual strife, between Satan and the Lord's angels. The Kabbalah, the Magyar claim'd, is the only one capable of discerning the two sides, and therefore delivering us from the grasp of Being towards Union to the One and Only God, for it alone can accesse His angels through His Word and climbe to the mystical Presence of God.}}

Scholarly interest in his idiosyncratic mysticism has only recently begun to emerge. Speculation regarding Czipleá's [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] and Kabbalistic sources ranges from [[John Dee]], [[Pico della Mirandola]] and [[Johann Reuchlin]], while attention has been drawn to his possible influence on the [[Cambridge Platonists]] and [[Metaphysical Poets]].

[[File:Laurent de la La Hyre 002.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Laurent%20de%20la%20La%20Hyre%20002.jpg|thumb|Theseus and Aethra, by Laurent de La Hire (1606-1656)]]In [[Greek mythology]], '''Aethra''' or '''Aithra''' ({{lang-grc|Αἴθρα}}, {{IPA-el|ǎi̯tʰra|pron}}, {{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|iː|θ|r|ə|}}, the "bright sky"&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]], ''The Greek Myths'', (1955; 1960) index, ''s.v.'' "Aethra".&lt;/ref&gt;)  was a daughter of King [[Pittheus]] of [[Troezen]] and sister of [[Henioche]]. She was the mother of [[Theseus]] (his father was the [[Kings of Athens|king]] [[Aegeus]] of [[Athens]], or in some versions, [[Poseidon]]) and of [[Clymene (mythology)|Clymene]] (by [[Hippalces]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on ''Iliad'', 3. 144; [[Dictys Cretensis]]. ''Journal of the Trojan War, Book 6.2''&lt;/ref&gt; Aethra was also called '''Pittheis''' after her father Pittheus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]]. ''[[Heroides]], 10.31''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
=== Early life ===
[[Bellerophon]] came to Troezen to ask Aethra's father, Pittheus for the maiden's hand in marriage, but the hero was banished from [[Corinth]] before the nuptials took place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. ''Description of Greece, 2.31.12''&lt;/ref&gt;

King Aegeus who was childless with his previous marriages went to Troezen, a city southwest of Athens that had as its patrons [[Athena]] and Poseidon. Here Pittheus got Aegeus drunk on unmixed wine and put him to bed with his daughter. Following the instructions of Athena in a dream, she left the sleeping Aegeus and waded across to the island of [[Sphairia]] that lay close to Troezen's shore. There she poured a [[libation]] to Sphairos, [[Pelops]]' charioteer, and was raped by Poseidon in the night. Aethra was therefore impregnated by both Aegeus&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]]. ''Theseus, 3''; [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]]. ''Fabulae, 14''&lt;/ref&gt; and Poseidon&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]]''. Bibliotheca, 3.15.7;'' [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]]''. Fabulae, 37;'' [[Bacchylides]]. ''Dithyrambs, 3.34''&lt;/ref&gt; in the process. According to [[Plutarch]], her father spread this report merely that Theseus might be regarded as the son of Poseidon, who was much revered at Troezen.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]]. ''Theseus, 6''&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion, however, is nothing else but an attempt to strip the genuine story of its marvels. [[File:Demophon_Aithra_Staatliche_Antikensammlungen_2687.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Demophon_Aithra_Staatliche_Antikensammlungen_2687.jpg|right|thumb|

]]Aethra, later on dedicated in the island of Sphairia a temple to Athena Apaturia (the Deceitful), and called the island Hiera instead of Sphaeria, and also introduced among the maidens of Troezen the custom of dedicating their girdles to Athena Apaturia on the day of their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. ''Description of Greece, 2.33.11''&lt;/ref&gt; At a later time, when Aethra was thus doubly pregnant, Aegeus decided to go back to Athens. Before leaving, he covered his sandals, shield and sword under a huge rock, that served as a primitive altar to Strong [[Zeus]], and told her that when their son would grow up, he should move the rock and bring his weapons back. Aethra did as she was told, and Theseus, recovering the weapons that were his birthright, grew to be a great hero, killing the [[Minotaur]], among other adventures.

=== Later adventures ===
Later, when Theseus kidnapped [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], he gave her to Aethra for safekeeping. Helen's brothers, the [[Dioscuri]], took Helen back and kidnapped Aethra to [[Sparta|Lacedaemon]] in revenge. There she became a slave of Helen with whom she went to [[Troy]] and remained there until found by her grandson, [[Acamas]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. ''Theseus, 34;'' [[Homer]]. ''[[Iliad]], 3.144;'' [[Dio Chrysostom]]. ''Speeches, [http://94.70.254.130:8080/topostextnew/work.php?work_id=197#11.59 11.59]''&lt;/ref&gt; At the taking of [[Troy]] she came to the camp of the Greeks, where she was recognised by her grandsons, and [[Demophon of Athens|Demophon]], one of them, asked [[Agamemnon]] to procure her liberation. Agamemnon accordingly sent a messenger to Helen to request her to give up Aethra. This was granted, and Aethra became free again.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece, 10.25.3''; [[Dictys Cretensis]]. ''Journal of the Trojan War, 5.13''&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], she afterwards put an end to her own life from grief at the death of her sons.&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus. ''Fabulae, 243''&lt;/ref&gt; The history of her bondage to Helen was represented on the celebrated chest of [[Cypselus]],&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece, 4.19.1;'' [[Dio Chrysostom|Dion Chrysostom]].'' Orations, 11''&lt;/ref&gt; and in a painting by [[Polygnotus]] in the [[Lesche]] of [[Delphi]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece, 10.25.2.''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akhtem Seitablayev''' ({{Lang-crh|Ahtem Şevket oğlu Seytablayev}}; born 11 December 1972 in [[Yangiyo‘l]], [[Uzbek SSR]]) is a Crimean-Tatar actor, screenwriter, and film director based in Ukraine. He is the director of several high-profile films, including ''[[Haytarma]]'' in 2013 and ''Another's Prayer'' in 2017''.'' He has expressed opposition to the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] and his films about the fate of several prominent Crimean Tatars have been criticized by Russian news outlets.

== Early life ==
Seitablayev was born in 1972 in [[Yangiyo‘l]], then part of the [[Uzbek SSR]]. His parents were deported to Uzbekistan in the [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|Sürgün]] since Crimean Tatars were one of the ten ethnic groups to experience collective punishment of exile in the Stalin era. He attended school in Uzbekistan and remained in exile with his family until they moved back to [[Crimea]] during the [[Perestroika]] era in 1989, where he began his film career in 1992 after graduating from the Crimean Cultural Enlightenment School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kino-teatr.ru/kino/acter/m/post/16395/bio/|title=Ахтем Сеитаблаев|website=Кино-Театр.РУ|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lifeactor.ru/11840-ahtem-seytablaev.html|title=Ахтем Сейтаблаев|work=Актеры -  Биографии актеров - Фото актеров на Lifeactor.ru|access-date=2018-06-22|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tv.ua/interview/ahtem-seitablaev-v-dni-rozhdenija-detej-ja-ne-rabotaju-87730.html|title=Ахтем Сеитаблаев: В дни рождения детей я не работаю|access-date=2018-06-22|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
From 1992 to 2004 he worked at the Simferopol State Crimean Tatar Theater, where he directed several plays including works of [[Alexander Pushkin]]. In 2005 he began working at the [[Kiev Academic Theatre of Drama and Comedy on the left-bank of Dnieper]]. In 2009 he directed his first film, ''Quartet for Two.'' In 2013 he directed the movie ''[[Haytarma]]'' (English: Return) based on the real life of [[Amet-khan Sultan]], a Crimean Tatar [[flying ace]] and twice [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] who witnessed the [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|Sürgün]] but managed to avoid deportation due to his father's [[Laks (Caucasus)|Lak]] ancestory and the intervention of [[Timofey Khryukin]], commander of the [[8th Air Army]]. The film was praised by the [[Kyiv Post|''Kiev Post'']] as "must-see for history enthusiasts" and criticized by ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' for depicting the organizers of the deportation in a bad light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/guide/movies/haytarma-the-first-crimean-tatar-movie-is-a-must-see-for-history-enthusiasts-326698.html|title='Haytarma', the first Crimean Tatar movie, is a must-see for history enthusiasts - Jul. 08, 2013|date=2013-07-08|work=KyivPost|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kp.ru/daily/26093/2993195/|title=Почему правда о войне до сих пор ссорит нас с крымскими татарами?|last=правды»|first=Галина САПОЖНИКОВА {{!}} Сайт «Комсомольской|date=2013-06-18|work=KP.RU - сайт «Комсомольской правды»|access-date=2018-06-22|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2016 to 2017 he directed [[Another's Prayer]], based on the real life of [[Saide Arifova]], a kindergarten director who saved over 80 Jewish children during the Holocaust by switching their ethnicity listing and teaching them to imitate Crimean Tatar customs and language to hide them from the [[Gestapo]]. Eventually the Nazis suspected she was involved in hiding Jewish children and tortured her, but she refused to betray any names. After the Red Army retook control of Crimea she saved them again by explaining to the [[NKVD]] that the children were Jewish, not Crimean Tatar, and hence were allowed to stay in Crimea instead of being deported to the desert. The film debuted on 18 May 2017, the anniversary of the Sürgün. Originally the film was supposed to be filmed in Crimea, but after the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014 it was decided that the filming would be done in mainland Ukraine and Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ukrinform.ru/rubric-society/2230924-v-kieve-sostoalas-premera-filma-ahtema-sejtablaeva-cuzaa-molitva.html|title=В Киеве состоялась премьера фильма Ахтема Сейтаблаева "Чужая молитва"|access-date=2018-06-22|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
On 29 May 2018, he released a statement in support of [[Oleg Sentsov]], a film director arrested in Russian-controlled Crimea. He is married to actress Ivanna Dyadyur, and has three children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://24tv.ua/ru/oleg__otec_kak_i_vy__seitablaev_prosit_trampa_pomoch_osvobodit_sencova_n977782|title=Олег – отец, как и вы, – Сеитаблаев просит Трампа помочь освободить Сенцова - 24 Канал|website=24 Канал|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Serge Alexandre Stavisky''' (November 20, 1886, [[Ukraine]] – January 8, 1934, [[Chamonix]]) was a French financier and [[embezzler]] whose actions created a political scandal that became known as the [[Stavisky Affair]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Jankowski, ''Stavisky - A Confidence Man in the Republic of Virtue'', (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Clay Large, ''Between Two Fires: Europes Path in the 1930s'' (W.W.Norton: 1990) pp 24-58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Alexandre Stavisky was a [[Polish Jew]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kathy Warnes|title=The Stavisky Affair - Sasha the Suave Scammer|url=https://historybecauseitshere.weebly.com/the-stavisky-affair---sasha-the-suave-scammer.html|newspaper=historybecauseitshere|date=|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; born in modern-day [[Ukraine]] whose Russian parents had moved to France.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Jankowski, ''Stavisky – A Confidence Man in the Republic of Virtue'' 
(2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Stavisky tried various professions, working as a café singer, as a nightclub manager, as a worker in a soup factory, and as the operator of a gambling den. He received French citizenship in 1910. In the 1930s he managed municipal pawnshops in Bayonne but also moved in financial circles. He sold lots of worthless bonds and financed his "hockshop" on the surety of what he called the emeralds of the late Empress of Germany — which later turned out to be glass. In 1927, Stavisky was put on trial for fraud for the first time, charged with a 6 million pound fraud. However, the trial was postponed again and again, and he was granted bail 19 times.

Faced with exposure in December 1933, Stavisky fled. On 8 January 1934, the police found him in a [[Chamonix]] chalet dying from two gunshot wounds to the head. Surgeons struggled to save him but he died early in the hours of January 9.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Mirror headline, January 9, 1934,&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, Stavisky committed suicide, but historians generally agree he was murdered to keep him silent.

In the aftermath there were many riots on the streets of Paris, resulting in 250 arrests on January 10 as  news of government involvement in the financial scandal broke.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Mirror headline January 10, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;  The French premier  [[Camille Chautemps]] was forced to resign owing to the number of ministers wrapped up in the affair, and rumours that he had ordered Stavisky's assassination.   An official public enquiry was ordered into the affair. Shortly before it began a senior judge, Albert Prince, who was due to be a witness, was found murdered on a railway line near Dijon, having been tricked to go there from Paris by means of a bogus telegram claiming his mother was very ill.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Mirror headline, 22nd February 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Stavisky died on January 8, 1934, [[Chamonix]]. He was buried in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].

In ''[[Forces occultes]]'', a film commissioned in 1942 by the "Propaganda Abteilung", a delegation of [[Nazi Germany]]'s propaganda ministry within [[German occupation of France during World War II|occupied France]], Stavisky was presented as both a [[Freemason]] and a crook. In 1974, film director [[Alain Resnais]] told the story in the film ''[[Stavisky]]...'' that featured [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] in the title role and [[Anny Dupérey]] as his wife Arlette.

[[Julia Angwin]], in her 2014 book ''Dragnet Nation'', describes Soltani as 'the leading technical expert on [[ad tracking]] technology'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Angwin |first=Julia |date=2014 |title=Dragnet Nation |url=https://www.amazon.com/Dragnet-Nation-Security-Relentless-Surveillance/dp/0805098070 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Times Books, Henry Holt &amp; Company |pages=178 |isbn=978-0805098075}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of the team at ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that shared the 2014 [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] with ''[[Guardian US|The Guardian US]]'' for their coverage of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|disclosures]] about surveillance done by the US [[National Security Agency]].&lt;ref name=WP12&gt;{{cite news|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Craig Timberg |author3=Steven Rich |last-author-amp=yes |title=Files show NSA targeted Tor encrypted network|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2014/public-service/washpost/12washpostnsa2014.pdf|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=5 October 2013}} (Contributors: Ashkan Soltani and Julie Tate)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WP13&gt;{{cite news|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Ashkan Soltani |lastauthoramp=yes |title=NSA collects millions of e-mail address books globally|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2014/public-service/washpost/13washpostnsa2014.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WP14&gt;{{cite news|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Ashkan Soltani |lastauthoramp=yes |title=NSA taps Yahoo, Google links|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2014/public-service/washpost/14washpostnsa2014.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WP16&gt;{{cite news|author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Ashkan Soltani |lastauthoramp=yes |title=NSA tracking cellphone locations worldwide, Snowden documents show|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2014/public-service/washpost/16washpostnsa2014.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flash cookie research==

Soltani's first high-profile research project was a 2009 study, supported by the [[National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation's]] [http://www.truststc.org/ Team for Research in Ubiquitous Secure Computing], documenting the use of [[zombie cookies|zombie]] Flash cookies by several online advertising networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wired.com/business/2009/08/you-deleted-your-cookies-think-again/ | title=You Deleted Your Cookies? Think Again | accessdate=2013-01-21 | last=Singel| first=Ryan | date=2009-08-10 | work=Wired News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soltani and his colleagues at Berkeley revealed that websites were recreating tracking cookies after consumers deleted them by storing the unique tracking identifiers in Flash cookies, which were not automatically deleted when consumers cleared their browser cookies.&lt;ref&gt;Soltani, Ashkan; Canty, Shannon; Mayo, Quentin; Thomas, Lauren and Hoofnagle, Chris Jay, "Flash Cookies and Privacy" (August 10, 2009). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1446862&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication of Soltani's research, class action law firms filed suit against several advertising networks and websites. Quantcast, Clearspring and VideoEgg collectively agreed to pay a total of $3.4 million to settle the lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/162977/metacafe-promises-not-to-use-flash-cookies-for-tra.html | title=Metacafe Promises Not To Use Flash Cookies For Tracking | accessdate=2013-01-21 | last=Davis| first=Wendy | date=2011-11-23 | work=MediaPost New}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ETag tracking research==

In 2011, Soltani and Berkeley law professor Chris Hoofnagle published a follow-up study, documenting the use of web browser cache [[HTTP ETag|ETags]] to store persistent identifiers.&lt;ref&gt;Ayenson, Mika, Wambach, Dietrich James, Soltani, Ashkan, Good, Nathan and Hoofnagle, Chris Jay, Flash Cookies and Privacy II: Now with HTML5 and ETag Respawning (July 29, 2011). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1898390&lt;/ref&gt; As with the case of Flash cookies, the identifiers stored in the ETags persisted even after consumers deleted their browser cookies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wired.com/business/2011/07/undeletable-cookie/ | title=Researchers Expose Cunning Online Tracking Service That Can’t Be Dodged | accessdate=2013-01-21 | last=Singel| first=Ryan | date=2011-07-29 | work=Wired News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ETag tracking issue caught the attention of several members of [[United States Congress|Congress]], who wrote to the Federal Trade Commission in September 2011 and urged the agency to investigate the use of advanced tracking technologies as a potentially unfair or deceptive business practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/09/congressmen-blast-supercookies-as-privacy-menace/ | title=

Several companies performing ETag based tracking that were identified by the research team were subsequently sued by class action lawyers. In January 2013, KISSmetrics, an online advertising network, settled its ETag related lawsuit for $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/191409/kissmetrics-finalizes-supercookies-settlement.html | title=KISSmetrics Finalizes Supercookies Settlement | accessdate=2013-01-18 | last=Davis| first=Wendy | date=2013-01-23 | work=MediaPost New}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bette Nesmith Graham''' (March 23, 1924 – May 12, 1980) was an American typist, commercial artist, and the [[inventor]] of [[Liquid Paper]]. She was the mother of musician and producer [[Michael Nesmith]] of [[The Monkees]].&lt;ref name=famous&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.women-inventors.com/Bette-Nesmith-Graham.asp|title=Bette Nesmith Graham|accessdate=March 18, 2010|publisher=[[Famous Women Inventors]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Graham was born Bette Clair McMurray, in [[Dallas]], Texas, to Jesse McMurray, an automotive supply company manager, and Christine Duval.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Birth Index, "Robert Micheal Nesmith" born 1942, retrieved from Ancestry.com, lists his mother's full birthname.&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised in [[San Antonio]] and graduated from [[Alamo Heights High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gihon.com/pages/bette_graham/bette_graham.html | title = Gihon Foundation, 1793 Catalina Street, Sand City, CA 93955 | accessdate = December 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She married Warren Audrey Nesmith (1919–1984) before he left to fight in [[World War II]]. While he was overseas she had a child ([[Michael Nesmith|Robert Michael Nesmith]], born December 30, 1942). After Warren Nesmith returned home, they divorced (1946). Her father died in the early 1950s, leaving some property in Dallas to Bette. She, her mother, Michael, and her sister Yvonne moved there. To support herself as a single mother, she worked as a secretary at Texas Bank and Trust. She eventually attained the position of the executive secretary, the highest position open at that time to women in the industry.

It was difficult to erase mistakes made by early electric typewriters, which caused problems. In order to make extra money she used her talent painting holiday windows at the bank. She realized, as she said, "with lettering, an artist never corrects by erasing, but always paints over the error. So I decided to use what artists use. I put some [[tempera]] water-based paint in a bottle and took my watercolor brush to the office. I used that to correct my mistakes."

Graham secretly used her white correction paint for five years, making some improvements with help from her son's [[chemistry]] teacher at [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Dallas, Texas)|Thomas Jefferson High School]] in [[Dallas]]. Some bosses admonished her against using it, but coworkers frequently sought her "paint out". She eventually began marketing her [[typewriter]] [[correction fluid]] as "Mistake Out" in 1956. The name was later changed to [[Liquid Paper]] when she began her own company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | last = Blattman | first = Elissa | title = "Three Every-day Items Invented by Women" | publisher = National Women's History Museum | year = 2013 | url = https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/three-every-day-items-invented-women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mistake Out started the 1960s operating at a small loss, with Nesmith's home doubling as company headquarters. As the product became an indispensable tool of the secretarial trade, Nesmith relocated production and shipping from her kitchen to a 10 feet-by-26 feet portable metal structure in her backyard, where packaging, shipping, and production were centered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Edward T. |editor1-last=James |title=Notable American women.|date=2004|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn= 9780674014886|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bette Nesmith married Robert Graham in 1962; he joined her in running the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebratingtexas.com/tr/lsl/94.pdf|title=Bette Nesmith Graham|accessdate=March 18, 2010|publisher=Celebrating Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countyhistorian.com/cecilweb/index.php/Robert_Michael_Nesmith#Primary_sources_for_2|title=Robert Michael Nesmith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She sold Liquid Paper to the [[Gillette|Gillette Corporation]] for [[USD]] $47.5 million in 1979. At the time, her company employed 200 people and made 25 million bottles of Liquid Paper per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gillette Paper Pact|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0D17FA3D5C12728DDDA80A94D1405B898BF1D3|quote=The [[Gillette]] Company said it had agreed to acquire the Liquid Paper Corporation for about $47.5 million in cash. [[Liquid Paper]], which is privately held, earned more than $3.5 million on sales of $38 million in its fiscal year ended April 30.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 21, 1979|accessdate=July 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
The German company has made such a name for itself that the wonder of liquid paper is today known formally by many a person across the globe as Tipp-Ex.--&gt;

Bette Nesmith died on May 12, 1980, at the age of 56, in [[Richardson, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dies at 56|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wHshAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=S4oFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4613,3284045&amp;dq=bette+nesmith+graham&amp;hl=en|quote=Bette Claire Graham, inventor of Liquid Paper ...

==Management style==
From the start, Graham ran her company with a unique combination of spirituality, egalitarianism, and pragmatism. Raised a [[Methodist]], Graham converted to [[Christian Science]] in 1942, and this faith inspired the development of her corporate "Statement of Policy". Part-code of ethics, part-business philosophy, it covered everything from her belief in a "Supreme Being" to a focus on decentralized decision making and an emphasis on product quality over profit motive. She also believed that women could bring a more nurturing and humanistic quality to the male world of business, and did so herself by including a greenbelt with a fish pond, an employee library, and a childcare center in her new company headquarters in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Edward T. |editor1-last=James |title=Notable American women.|date=2004|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn= 9780674014886 |page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

{{The Holocaust sidebar}}
'''Children''' were especially vulnerable to Nazi murder or death in the era of [[the Holocaust]]. It is estimated that 1.5&amp;nbsp;million children, nearly all Jewish, were murdered during the Holocaust, either directly or as a direct consequence of Nazi actions.
 
The Nazis advocated killing children of "unwanted" or "dangerous" groups in accordance with their ideological views, either as part of the "racial struggle" or as a measure of preventive security. The Nazis particularly targeted [[Jewish]] children, but also targeted ethnically [[Poles|Polish]] children, [[Romani people|Romani]] (Gypsy) children, and children with mental or physical defects (disabled children). The Germans and their collaborators killed children both for these ideological reasons and in retaliation for real or alleged partisan attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005142 CHILDREN DURING THE HOLOCAUST]&lt;/ref&gt; Early killings were encouraged by the Nazis in [[action T4]], where children with disabilities were gassed using [[carbon monoxide]], starved to death, given [[phenol]] injections to the heart, or [[hanging|hanged]].

This article deals with those 1,500,000 children, nearly all Jewish, who were killed by the Nazis. A much smaller number were saved. Some simply survived, often in a [[ghetto]], occasionally in a [[concentration camp]]. Some were saved in various programs like the [[Kindertransport]] and the [[One Thousand Children]] in which children fled their homeland. Other children were saved by becoming [[Hidden Children]].  During and even before the war many vulnerable children were rescued by [[Œuvre de Secours aux Enfants]] (OSE).

== Prelude to the Holocaust: Segregation in Schools ==
Segregation in schools began in April 1933 when the "Law Against Overcrowding in German schools" was enacted and a restriction was set allowing only 1.5 percent of Jewish children to be enrolled in public schools, this being a problem because 5 percent of the children in Germany were of Jewish descent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
It continued to get worse as German schools began to Aryanize. Jewish children were required to "learn" from different sources than their classmates. Also being subjected to worse grades than their Aryan peers whether or not their work was better. The Jewish children were not allowed to participate in most school activities, causing many to feel left out and segregated by children they once were friends with. As time passed most teachers became more enthusiastic about following the rules of Nazism and went from being quieter in their beliefs to using anti-Semitic terms in class.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Poor treatment of Jewish children was more common in rural schools but even in large cities they faced animosity from their teachers and classmates.

This led to Jewish students feeling distant from their classmates and had different effects on different families. Some Jewish children began to form small strikes in their schools leaving without permission during hate speak during class, others tried to conform with no success, and some parents just took their children out of school. Many mothers were horrified to find out that their children were being emotionally and physically attacked by their classmates and teachers for being Jewish. Mothers were more likely to take their children out of school than fathers, seeing and hearing from their children the majority of what actually happened at school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Eventually Jewish schools were built and the Jewish community jumped at the idea of their children being taught without fear of persecution, shown that only fourteen percent of Jewish children went to private school in 1932 to fifty-two percent in 1936.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Marion|title=Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish Life in Nazi Germany|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=94–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most were happy that their children could learn, many parents feared that this is what the Nazi party wanted all along, segregation of the Jewish community from the Aryan community.

==Numbers killed==
[[File:Arthur Szyk (1894-1951). To Be Shot as Dangerous Enemies of the Third Reich (1943), New York.jpg|thumb|''To Be Shot as Dangerous Enemies of the Third Reich'' (1943), by [[Arthur Szyk]]]]
The Germans and their collaborators killed as many as 2&amp;nbsp;million children, including over a million [[Jew]]ish children, hundreds of thousands of [[Poles|Polish]] children, and tens of thousands of [[Romani people|Romani]] children, moreover, children with physical and mental disabilities of various ethnicities living in institutions across the German-occupied Europe, or residing in the Soviet Union. Aside from Polish, Romani and Polish-Jewish children, many Jewish children from France, the Netherlands, Greece, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Italy, Romania and other countries also died as a result of mass deportations. The chances for survival for Jewish and some non-Jewish adolescents (13–18 years old) were greater, as they could be deployed at forced labor. Although, the unfortunate other children (usually infants or children younger than adolescent age) were disposed of in killing chambers such as gas filled rooms, or merely shot, to fulfill the German's "Final Solution" to exterminate the Jews.

The Germans believed the Jews to be impure and wished to wipe out their whole population or make them slaves. This is when they invented things such as concentration camps and gas chambers. Most going to these were the surviving adults or older teenagers because children couldn't work, therefore they were useless. Inside the concentration camps the presence of children was virtually nonexistent; they were either killed before they got into the camp, sent into gas chambers or shot in front of a mass grave ditch. There were also some experiments on children, especially if they were twins, but when the Holocaust ended and the Red Army found the 9,000 survivors, only 451 of them were children.

==Causes of death==
The fate of Jewish and non-Jewish children can be categorized in the following ways:
# children were killed when they arrived in killing centers;
# children were killed immediately after birth or in institutions;
# children born in ghettos and camps who survived because prisoners hid them;
# children, usually over age 12, who were used as laborers in kitchen camps, cleaning prisoner barracks, or working in the stables with Nazi officer horses and as subjects of [[Nazi human experimentation|medical experiments]]; and
# those children killed during reprisal operations or so-called [[anti-partisan operations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=2006 Christian Gerlach, Kalkulierte Morde. Die deutsche Wirtschafts- und Vernichtungspolitik in Weißrußland 1941–1944]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
In the ghettos, which the Germans established early in the war in many Polish towns and cities such as [[Warsaw]] and [[Łódź]], Jewish children died from starvation and exposure as well as lack of adequate clothing and shelter. The German authorities were indifferent to this mass death because they considered most of the younger ghetto children to be unproductive and hence "useless eaters". Indeed, the Germans deliberately restricted the food available to the strictly controlled ghettos under their control. The ghettos were liquidated from 1942 onwards, and their inhabitants murdered at various [[death camp]]s. Because children were generally too young to be deployed as forced labor, the German authorities generally selected them, along with the elderly, ill, and disabled, for the first deportations to [[Nazi extermination camps|killing centers]], or as the first victims led to mass graves to be shot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fightdemback.org/2008/02/11/doin-it-for-the-kids/ Doin’ it for the kids!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516235751/http://www.fightdemback.org/2008/02/11/doin-it-for-the-kids/ |date=16 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The children that were healthy enough for the labor were often worked to death doing jobs to benefit the camp, but sometimes children were forced to do unnecessary jobs like digging ditches.

Non-Jewish children from certain targeted groups were not spared. Examples include Romani (Gypsy) children killed in Auschwitz concentration camp; 5,000 to 7,000 children killed as victims of the "euthanasia" program; children murdered in reprisals, including most of the children of Lidice; and children in villages in the occupied Soviet Union who were killed with their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www1.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005142 |title=CHILDREN DURING THE HOLOCAUST |access-date=5 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506012037/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005142 |archive-date=6 May 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical atrocities and kidnapping==
[[File:Children headed for deportation.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Ghetto Litzmannstadt]]. Children rounded up for deportation to the [[Chelmno extermination camp|Kulmhof extermination camp]].]]
[[File:66935A.jpeg|thumb|Jewish twins kept alive to be used in Mengele's medical experiments. These children were liberated from Auschwitz by the Red Army in January 1945.]]

The German authorities also incarcerated a number of children in concentration camps and transit camps. [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] physicians and medical researchers used a number of children, including twins, in concentration camps for medical experiments that often resulted in the deaths of the children. Concentration camp authorities deployed adolescents, particularly Jewish adolescents, at forced labor in the concentration camps, where many died because of conditions. The German authorities held other children under appalling conditions in transit camps, such as the case of [[Anne Frank]] and her sister in [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]], and non-Jewish orphaned children whose parents the German military and police units had killed in so-called anti-partisan operations. Some of these orphans were held temporarily in the [[Majdanek concentration camp]] and other detention camps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/pinkas_poland/pol7_00014.html "Lublin" chapter from Pinkas Hakehillot Polin (cont.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In their "search to retrieve 'Aryan blood'," or the perfect race, SS race experts ordered hundreds of children in occupied Poland and the occupied [[Soviet Union]] to be kidnapped and transferred to the Reich to be adopted by racially suitable German families. Although the basis for these decisions was "race-scientific," often blond hair, blue eyes, or fair skin was sufficient to merit the "opportunity" to be "Germanized." On the other hand, female Poles and Soviet civilians who had been deported to Germany for forced labor and who had had sexual relations with a German man—often under duress—resulting in pregnancy were forced to have abortions or to bear their children under conditions that would ensure the infant's death, if the "race experts" determined that the child would have insufficient German blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.projetaladin.org/en/children-and-the-holocaust.html |title=Children During the Holocaust |access-date=1 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401180707/http://www.projetaladin.org/en/children-and-the-holocaust.html |archive-date=1 April 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transit Camps ==
Transit camps were temporary stops on the way to concentration camps during the Holocaust. Many children were brought with their families to transit camps, unsure of what awaited them. Some were filled with the hope of starting a new life and making friends in the camps, while many others were scared. Children brought to the transit camps came from all different backgrounds. But the reality of transit camps became apparent.

Children carried on with their lives in transit camps while bare bodies and metal frames for beds surrounded them. There was a lack of food, a fear of trains coming for deportation, and no school supplies. Children began to see their parents in a different light because each family member dealt with hardships during their time in the transit camps.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Dwork, Deborah. "Transit Camps." Children with a Star: Jewish Youth in Nazi Europe, Yale University Press, 1993, pp. 113–154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Children had few resources in place at the transit camps to help foster growth. A group of Hungarian Zionists made a rescue committee to negotiate and prevent deportations. Older girls were called upon to take care of the young children. Physicians, nurses, and musicians organized lectures, concerts, and activities for the children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Voluntary interns and philanthropic organizations supplied food, clothing, and organized secretive teaching rooms to help the kids continue their education. Child care workers taught the children about the ideas of Zionism, the spirit of democracy, and an affectionate atmosphere. These groups also did their best to ease the hunger issues in the camps. Overall, life in transit camps were a gradual adjustment to the abnormal. They learned to live their daily lives while learning to deal with hunger and fear.

==Auschwitz==
[[File:Czeslawa Kwoka - Brasse.jpg|thumb|[[Czesława Kwoka]], child victim in Auschwitz]]
Children were exposed to experimentation at other camps, especially at [[Auschwitz]], where [[Joseph Mengele]] was active. Mengele's research subjects were better fed and housed than other prisoners and temporarily safe from the gas chambers.{{sfn|Nyiszli|2011|p=57}} He established a kindergarten for children that were the subjects of experiments, along with all Gypsy children under the age of six. The facility provided better food and living conditions than other areas of the camp, and even included a playground.{{sfn|Kubica|1998|pp=320–321}} When visiting his child subjects, he introduced himself as "Uncle Mengele" and offered them sweets.{{sfn|Lagnado|Dekel|1991|p=9}} But he was also personally responsible for the deaths of an unknown number of victims that he killed via lethal injection, shootings, beatings, and through selections and deadly experiments.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=341}} Lifton describes Mengele as sadistic, lacking empathy, and extremely antisemitic, believing the Jews should be eliminated entirely as an inferior and dangerous race.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|pp=376–377}} Mengele's son Rolf said his father later showed no remorse for his wartime activities.{{sfn|Posner|Ware|1986|p=48}}

A former Auschwitz prisoner doctor said:

{{quote|He was capable of being so kind to the children, to have them become fond of him, to bring them sugar, to think of small details in their daily lives, and to do things we would genuinely admire&amp;nbsp;... And then, next to that,&amp;nbsp;... the crematoria smoke, and these children, tomorrow or in a half-hour, he is going to send them there. Well, that is where the anomaly lay.{{sfn|Lifton|1985|p=337}} }}

[[File:WP Josef Mengele 1956.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Photo from Mengele's Argentine identification document (1956)]]

Mengele had a particular fascination with twins for multiple reasons. He was interested in the difference between identical and fraternal twins as well as how genetic diseases affected them and where they originated. The experiments also served to distinguish between genetic traits and those developed by the environment of the child. Mengele was known to pretend to be off duty while a train of new prisoners arrived, just so he could personally select any twins he saw. The concentration camps were the ideal environment for Mengele to perform his experiments to the extent he wished, since there were little to no regulations. This, combined with the fact that he was extremely anti-semitic allowed him to treat his victims as if they weren’t human. Twins were his preferred subjects for his experiments because he had a fascination with genetic conditions. This is why he also operated on children born with two different colored eyes, a condition known as heterochromia. His goal in his studies was partly to find genetic weaknesses in the makeup of Jewish or Roma people to back up the prejudices held by the Nazi party. Mengele hypothesized that his subjects were particularly vulnerable to certain diseases because of their race. In addition to that, he believed they had degenerative blood and tissue based on his samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Josef Mengele |url=https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/josef-mengele |website=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twins were subjected to weekly examinations and measurements of their physical attributes by Mengele or one of his assistants.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=350}} Experiments performed by Mengele on twins included unnecessary amputation of limbs, intentionally infecting one twin with typhus or other diseases, and transfusing the blood of one twin into the other. Many of the victims died while undergoing these procedures.{{sfn|Posner|Ware|1986|p=37}} After an experiment was over, the twins were sometimes killed and their bodies dissected.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=351}} Nyiszli recalled one occasion where Mengele personally killed fourteen twins in one night via a chloroform injection to the heart.{{sfn|Lifton|1985}} If one twin died of disease, Mengele killed the other so that comparative post-mortem reports could be prepared.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|pp=347, 353}}

Mengele's experiments with eyes included attempts to change eye color by injecting chemicals into the eyes of living subjects and killing people with heterochromatic eyes so that the eyes could be removed and sent to Berlin for study.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=362}} His experiments on dwarfs and people with physical abnormalities included taking physical measurements, drawing blood, extracting healthy teeth, and treatment with unnecessary drugs and X-rays.{{sfn|Astor|1985|p=102}} Many of the victims were sent to the gas chambers after about two weeks, and their skeletons were sent to Berlin for further study.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=360}} Mengele sought out pregnant women, on whom he would perform experiments before sending them to the gas chambers.{{sfn|Brozan|1982}} Witness Vera Alexander described how he sewed two Gypsy twins together back to back in an attempt to create [[conjoined twins]].{{sfn|Posner|Ware|1986|p=37}} The children died of gangrene after several days of suffering.{{sfn|Mozes-Kor|1992|p=57}}

==Sisak concentration camp==

During the existence of [[Independent State of Croatia]], [[Ustaše|the Croatian Ustaše]] established numerous concentration camps like those in [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jusp-jasenovac.hr/Default.aspx?sid=6711|publisher=Jasenovac Memorial Site|title=List of individual victims of Jasenovac concentration camp|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Đakovo concentration camp|Đakovo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=ABSEES|first=|title=ABSEES - Soviet and East European Abstracts Series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdpXAAAAYAAJ|date=January 1973|publisher=ABSEES}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jastrebarsko concentration camp|Jastrebarsko]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.jusp-jasenovac.hr/Default.aspx?sid=7384| title = Jastrebarsko Camp| author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;| date = | website = www.jusp-jasenovac.hr| publisher = Jasenovac Memorial Site| access-date = 11 September 2016| ref = {{harvid|Jasenovac Memorial Site}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which many [[Serbs|Serbian]], [[Jews|Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] children have died as inmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Fumić|first = Ivan|title = Djeca&amp;nbsp;— žrtve ustaškog režima|trans-title = Child Victims of the Ustaše Regime|year = 2011| publisher = Savez antifasistickih borca I antifasista republike Hrvatske [Union of Anti-Fascist Fighters and Anti-Fascists of the Republic of Croatia]| location = Zagreb, Croatia| isbn = 978-953-7587-09-3| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| title = Zločini okupatora i njegovih saradnika nad decom kozarskog područja 1941–1945. godine| trans-title = The Crimes of the Occupiers and their Collaborators Against Children in the Kozara region 1941–1945| last = Lukić| first = Dragoje| conference = Kozara u narodnooslobodilačkoj borbi i socijalističkoj revoluciji (1941–1945) [Kozara in the National Liberation War and Socialist Revolution: (1941–1945)] (27&amp;nbsp;– 28 October 1977)| publisher = Nacionalni park "Kozara"| year = 1980| pages = 269–284| location = Prijedor, Yugoslavia| oclc = 10076276| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, there was Sisak concentration camp which was specially formed for children, created as a part of Jasenovac concentration camp.&lt;ref&gt;Marija Vuselica: Regionen Kroatien in Der Ort des Terrors: Arbeitserziehungslager, Ghettos, Jugendschutzlager, Polizeihaftlager, Sonderlager, Zigeunerlager, Zwangsarbeiterlager, Volume 9 of Der Ort des Terrors, Publisher	C.H.Beck, 2009, {{ISBN|9783406572388}} pages 321-323&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anna Maria Grünfelder: Arbeitseinsatz für die Neuordnung Europas: Zivil- und ZwangsarbeiterInnen aus Jugoslawien in der "Ostmark" 1938/41-1945, Publisher Böhlau Verlag Wien, 2010 {{ISBN|9783205784531}} pages 101-106&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sisak children's concentration camp]] was founded on 3 August 1942 following the [[Kozara Offensive]].&lt;ref name="JMCSisakCamp"&gt;{{cite web|title=SISAK CAMP|url=http://www.jusp-jasenovac.hr/Default.aspx?sid=7375|website=Jasenovac Memorial Cite|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of an assembly camp, officially named the "Refugee Transit Camp",.&lt;ref name="JMCSisakCamp"/&gt; This concentration camp consisted of special part officially called "Shelter for the refugee children" which were under the auspices of the "Ustasha Female Lineage" and "Ustasha Security Service", and under the direct control of Dr. [[Antun Najžer]]. The camp was located in several buildings in [[Sisak]]; former ''Yugoslav Falconry Association'' (the so-called "Sokolana"), ''Sisters of St. Vincent nunnery'', saltwork Rice warehouse, Rajs Saltworks warehouse, Novi Sisak elementary school and the so-called "Karantena" (Quarantine). All these buildings were utterly unsuitable for the housing of children. For example, in the Falconry association, there were no doors; it was drafty because the whole construction was set up for drying the salt. Children, even the smallest ones who were only a few months old, had to lie on the floor with only a thin layer of straw, without any clothes or blankets.

The first group of children arrived on 3 August 1942;&lt;ref name="JMCSisakCamp"/&gt; there were 906 of them. The very next day another group of 650 children was brought; in the third group (arrived on 6 August ) was 1,272 children. In Teslic glasshouse and the newly built barracks, named "Karantena", a general concentration camp for men, women, and children had been established. During August and September 1942, Ustaše deprived 3,971 children of parents who were selected for forced labor in Nazi Germany. Thus from August 1942 to 8 February 1943, there were 6,693 detained children, mostly Serbs from Kozara, Kordun, and Slavonia. Despite the actions of [[Diana Budisavljević]] and tireless group of humanists – Jana Koh, Vera Luketić, Dragica Habazin, Ljubica and Vera Becić, Dr. Kamil Bresler, Ante Dumbović and sisters of the Red Cross, up to 40 children were dying every day.

When typhus epidemic broke out, Dr. Najžer ordered the transfer of the infected children to the improvised hospital, which however increased mortality among the children.

Dr. Lazar Margulješ testified about conditions at the concentration camp: "''I've noticed that the food parcels sent by Red Cross have never been given to the imprisoned children. My duty as a medic was to research these small prisoners, therefore I often visited these places: ''Sokolana'' building, where the children laid on bare concrete or, if they had little luck, on a little straw. The so-called hospital, in a small school in Old Sisak, had no beds so the children were lying on the floor with a little distracted and contaminated straw matted with blood and excrement and covered with swarms of flies."''

Jana Koh, former secretary of [[Croatian Red Cross]] stated following about the conditions in the Camp:

Testimony of Jana Koh, the Croatian Red Cross secretary that time:&lt;blockquote&gt;
The barracks were connected by the corridors guarded by the Ustashas. Not far from the ambulance, from another barracks, the sad cries of the children were heard. There was set, on the bare floor, four hundred children: newborns, children from a few weeks or months, up to ten years of age. How many children came, and where they were dispatched, could no longer be found out. The children in the childrens barracks cried inexorably and were calling their mothers, who were only a few steps away from the children, but the fascist criminals did not let mothers to approach their children. Older children tell us through tears, that they can not calm the little ones, because they are hungry, there are no one to change diapers of the little ones, and they are afraid that everyone will die. These children, who have not yet reached the age of ten, swear to us, "Come on, sister, bring us mothers, bring at least mothers to these little ones. You will see, if you do not bring them their mothers, they will suffocate, by the tears alone."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coroner Dr. David Egić officially recorded that out of 6,693 children, 1,152 died in the Camp, while teacher Ante Dumbović later claimed that the number was 1,630.&lt;ref name="JMCSisakCamp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Review of International Affairs, Volume 33, Issues 762-785, Federation of Yugoslav Journalists, 1982 page 31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Means of survival==
In spite of their acute vulnerability, many children discovered ways to survive. Children smuggled food and medicines into the ghettos, after smuggling personal possessions to trade for them out of the ghettos. Children in youth movements later participated in underground resistance activities. Many children escaped with parents or other relatives—and sometimes on their own—to family camps run by Jewish partisans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://jewishpartisans.org/pdfs/study_guide_OrbuchS.pdf Study Guide Sonia Orbuch: A Young Woman with the Russian Partisans]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1938 and 1939, the [[Kindertransport]] (Children's Transport) was a rescue effort, organized by the British government in cooperation with Jewish organizations, which brought about 10,000 refugee Jewish children (but importantly, without their parents) to safety in Great Britain from Nazi Germany and German-occupied territories. Likewise, [[Youth Aliyah]] (Youth Immigration) was responsible for integrating thousands of children into life in Palestine as a means for their survival as well as the revitalization of the [[Yishuv]] (Jewish settlement in Palestine).&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Marion A. (1999). Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish life in Nazi Germany. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hidden Children: Some non-Jews hid Jewish children and sometimes, as in the case of Anne Frank, hid other family members as well. Sometimes they were actually hidden; in other cases they were "adopted" into the family of the heroic well-doer.  And see the work of [[Œuvre de Secours aux Enfants]].

A unique case of hiding: in France, almost the entire Protestant population of [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon]], as well as many Catholic priests, nuns, and lay Catholics, hid Jewish children in the town from 1942 to 1944. In Italy and Belgium, many children survived in hiding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/arch/heroes.htm Elizabeth Altham, Catholic Heroes of the Holocaust] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312161238/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/arch/heroes.htm |date=12 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the surrender of Nazi Germany, ending World War II, refugees and displaced persons searched throughout Europe for missing children. Thousands of orphaned children were in displaced persons camps. Many surviving Jewish children fled eastern Europe as part of the mass exodus ([[Brihah]]) to the western zones of occupied Germany, en route to the Yishuv. Youth Aliyah continued its activities after the war by helping child survivors to move to the Palestine, and the newly created state of Israel after 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1396144 Dalia Ofer, Holocaust Survivors as Immigrants: The Case of Israel and the Cyprus Detainees]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020819225247/http://www.motl.org/resource/curriculum/curriculum_12.htm Shivat Tzion- The Return to Zion]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Desi''' {{IPA-hns|d̪eːsi|}} are the people, cultures, and products of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and their [[diaspora]], derived from Ancient [[Sanskrit]] ''देश (deśá)'', meaning ''Land'' or ''Country''.&lt;ref name="Shirley2010"&gt;{{cite book |first=Shirley R. |last=Steinberg |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnSBRxsjn_4C&amp;pg=PA87 |title=Boy Culture: An Encyclopedia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |date=17 June 2010 |access-date=12 March 2012 |first2=Michael |last2=Kehler |first3=Lindsay |last3=Cornish |pages=86–88 |isbn=978-0-313-35080-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As "desi" is a loose term, countries that are considered "desi" are subjective; however, it is often accepted that [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]] are Desi countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/desi |title=desi |work=OxfordDictionaries.com |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=2016 |access-date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Guha |first=Rohin |url= http://theaerogram.com/is-it-time-to-kill-off-the-word-desi/ |title=Is It Time to Kill Off the Word 'Desi'? |work=The Aerogram |date=12 October 2013 |access-date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[ethnonym]] belongs in the [[endonym]]ic category (i.e., it is a self-appellation). ''Desi'' is an [[India|Indian]] term that ultimately originates in the ''{{IAST|deśa}}'' ([[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa|देश}}) "region, province, country". The first known usage of the Sanskrit word is found in the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' (~200&amp;nbsp;BCE), where it defines the regional varieties of folk [[performing arts]], as opposed to the classical, pan-Indian ''margi''. Thus, ''{{IAST|svadeśa}}'' ({{lang-sa|स्वदेश}}) refers to one's own country or homeland, while ''{{IAST|paradeśa}}'' ({{lang-sa|परदेश}}) refers to another's country or a foreign land.

==History==
While the original Sanskrit word meant 'country', with time its usage shifted more towards referring to people, cultures, and products of a specific region; for example, desi food, desi calendars, and desi dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mughal |first=Muhammad Aurang Zeb |lay-summary= https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757206.2014.930034 |title=Calendars Tell History: Social Rhythm and Social Change in Rural Pakistan |work=History and Anthropology |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=592–613 |date=18 June 2014 |doi=10.1080/02757206.2014.930034|url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/13842/1/13842.pdf?DDD5+twxg95+d700tmt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desi contrasts with the [[Hindustani language]] word ''vilāyati'' (Anglicised as "[[Blighty]]"), which originally referred only to Britain (during the British rule ''vilāyat'', an Arabic-origin word meaning 'state', signified Britain) but may also refer more generally to anything that is European or Western. People from the subcontinent living in ''vilāyat'' (Britain) or in other Western countries refer to themselves and their ethnic culture as ''desi''. The ''desi/vilāyati'' pair of antonyms is widely used in subcontinent languages (Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Bengali etc.).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

After the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], the United States dramatically increased immigration from the subcontinent. As increasing numbers of students from the subcontinent arrived in the U.S. and UK, their countries of origin were colloquially referred to as ''{{IAST|deś}}''. For example, all things Indian including Indian expatriates were referred to as "desi".

Some second or third generation immigrants do not think of themselves as belonging to a particular nation, sub-culture, or caste, but as just plain [[South Asians]] or desis,{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} especially as intermarriage between different South Asian diaspora communities increases.

==Culture==
In the U.S., as in other countries, some diaspora desis are creating a "fusion" culture, in which foods, fashions, music, and the like from many areas of South Asia are "fused" both with each other and with elements from Western culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Kvetko |first=Peter |url=http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~dkapchan/home/folkloreweb/interactive/indianfilm/indianclub.html |title=When the East Is in the House: The Emergence of Dance Club Culture among Indian-American Youth |date=2002 &lt;!--Earliest known date of availability. Item itself is undated.--&gt; |publisher=[[University of Texas]] |archive-date=18 May 2006 |access-date=27 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518083228/http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~dkapchan/home/folkloreweb/interactive/indianfilm/indianclub.html |df= }} {{primary source inline|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, urban desi is a genre of music formed by the fusion of traditional Indian and Western [[urban music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95739927 |title=Urban Desi: A Genre on the Rise |first=Nishat |last=Kurwa |date=15 October 2008 |work=[[All Things Considered]] |via=NPR.org |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |access-date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing demand of popular programming for [[South Asians]] caused [[MTV]] to launch the desi-targeted television channel [[MTV Desi]].

In the UK, desi communities have continued the fusion culture which first emerged during the rule of the British Raj, influencing music, art, fashion and food. There are now dedicated radio stations catering to British-South Asians such as the [[BBC Asian Network]].

===Performing arts===
The [[Natya Shastra]] refers to the regional varieties of folk dance and music elements as ''desi'', and states that these are meant as pure entertainment for common people, while the pan-Indian ''margi'' elements are to spiritually enlighten the audience. The medieval developments of the [[classical Indian dance]] and music led to the introduction of desi gharanas, in addition to the classical [[gharana]]s codified in [[Natya Shastra]]. The ''desi'' gharanas further developed into the present-day [[adavu]]s. There is [[raga]] in Indian classical music known as desi.

===Food and drink===
{{main article|Desi daru|Desi cuisine}}
In regions of the Indian subcontinent, ''desi'' in the context of food, implies 'native' or 'traditional'. Common examples are "desi ghee", which is the traditional clarified butter used in the Indian subcontinent as opposed to more processed fats such as vegetable oils. "Desi chicken" may mean a native breed of chicken. This word is also usually restricted to Sanskrit-derived (Indo-Aryan) languages.

[[Plant breeding|Heritage]] varieties of vegetables and other produce can also be qualified as "desi". "Desi diet" refers to a diet and food choices followed by Indians around the world. ''[[Desi daru]]'' refers to "[[Desi liquor|country liquor]]", such as [[Feni (liquor)|fenny]], [[palm wine|toddy]] and [[arrack (drink)|arrack]]. It is differentiated from [[Indian-made foreign liquor]] such as Indian made [[whisky]], [[rum]], [[vodka]], etc.

In North America, "[[desi cuisine]]" or "desi food" most often refers to dishes commonly served in communities from the Indian subcontinent, especially Westernised{{clarify |date=July 2017 |reason=Why would "Desi" be used to refer especially to Westernized dishes rather than authentic or traditional ones? (note: reference source is broken)}} restaurant dishes such as [[chicken tikka masala]].&lt;ref name='Toronto Star'&gt;{{cite news |first1=Sanjeev |last1=Chandra |first2=Smita |last2=Chandra |title=The story of desi cuisine: Timeless desi dishes |date=7 February 2008 |url= https://www.thestar.com/DesiLife/article/300969 |work=Toronto Star |access-date=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diego Armando Maradona''' ({{IPA-es|ˈdjeɣo maɾaˈðona}}, born 30 October 1960) is an Argentine retired professional [[association football|footballer]] and current manager of Mexican second division club [[Dorados de Sinaloa|Dorados]]. Many in the sport, including football writers, players, and fans, regard him as [[List of association football players considered the greatest of all time|one of the greatest football players of all time]].&lt;!--This claim requires a reference that explicitly affirms it.--&gt; He  was joint [[FIFA Player of the Century|FIFA Player of the 20th Century]] with [[Pelé]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en03.touri.com/Berichte/FIFA-Spieler/MalePlayer.pdf FIFA Player of the Century] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426005029/http://en03.touri.com/Berichte/FIFA-Spieler/MalePlayer.pdf |date=26 April 2012 }}. touri.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/2000/12/10/maradona_pele_ap/ "Maradona or Pele?"].

His presence and leadership on the field had a great effect on his team's general performance, while he would often be singled out by the opposition. A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname "''El Pibe de Oro''" ("The Golden Boy"), a name that stuck with him throughout his career.&lt;ref name="Pibe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2008/10/sezioni/sport/calcio/maradona-ct-argentina/maradona-ct-argentina/maradona-ct-argentina.html|title=La nuova vita del Pibe de Oro Maradona ct dell'Argentina|publisher=la Repubblica|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An advanced [[playmaker]] who operated in the [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|classic number 10 position]], Maradona was the first player in football history to set the [[World football transfer record|world record transfer fee]] twice, first when he transferred to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] for a then world record £5 million, and second, when he transferred to [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] for another record fee £6.9 million.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; He played for [[Argentinos Juniors]], [[Boca Juniors]], Barcelona, Napoli, [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] and [[Newell's Old Boys]] during his club career, and is most famous for his time at Napoli and Barcelona where he won numerous accolades. 

In his international career with [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], he earned 91 [[cap (sport)|caps]] and scored 34 goals. Maradona played in four [[FIFA World Cup]]s, including the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in Mexico where he captained Argentina and led them to [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|victory over West Germany]] in the final, and won the [[Golden Ball (FIFA)|Golden Ball]] as the tournament's best player. In the [[Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup)|1986 World Cup quarter final]], he scored both goals in a 2–1 victory over [[England national football team|England]] that entered football history for two different reasons. The first goal was an unpenalized handling foul known as the "Hand of God", while the second goal followed a {{convert|60|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} dribble past five England players, voted "Goal of the Century" by FIFA.com voters in 2002.&lt;ref name="voted"&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/newscentre/news/newsid=82406/index.html "Diego Maradona goal voted the FIFA World Cup™ Goal of the Century"].

Maradona played his first [[1982 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] tournament in 1982 in his new country of residence, Spain. Argentina played [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in the opening game of the 1982 Cup at the Camp Nou in [[Barcelona]]. The Catalan crowd was eager to see their new world-record signing Maradona in action, but he did not perform to expectations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetworldcup.com/CUPS/1982/wc82story.html 1982 – Story of Spain '82].

Although the team convincingly beat both Hungary and [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] in [[Alicante]] to progress to the second round, there were internal tensions within the team, with the younger, less experienced players at odds with the older, more experienced players. In a team that also included such players as [[Mario Kempes]], [[Osvaldo Ardiles]], [[Ramón Díaz]], [[Daniel Bertoni]], [[Alberto Tarantini]], [[Ubaldo Fillol]] and [[Daniel Passarella]], the Argentine side was defeated in the second round by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and by eventual winners [[Italy national football team|Italy]].

In his autobiography, Maradona argued that the test result was due to his personal trainer giving him the power drink Rip Fuel. His claim was that the U.S. version, unlike the Argentine one, contained the chemical and that, having run out of his Argentine dosage, his trainer unwittingly bought the U.S. formula. FIFA expelled him from USA '94, and Argentina were subsequently eliminated in the second round by [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in [[Los Angeles]].

The [[Captain (association football)|team leader]] on and off the field – he would speak up on a range of issues on behalf of the players – Maradona’s ability as a player and his overpowering personality had a major positive effect on his team, with his 1986 World Cup teammate [[Jorge Valdano]] stating: "Maradona was a technical leader: a guy who resolved all difficulties that may come up on the pitch. Firstly, he was in charge of making the miracles happen, that's something that gives team-mates a lot of confidence. Secondly, the scope of his celebrity was such that he absorbed all the pressures on behalf of his team-mates. What I mean is: one slept soundly the night before a game not just because you knew you were playing next to Diego and Diego did things no other player in the world could do, but also because unconsciously we knew that if it was the case that we lost then Maradona would shoulder more of the burden, would be blamed more, than the rest of us.

==Personal life==

===Family===
[[File:Maradonas's jersey donated to Pope Francis.jpg|thumb|upright|Having returned to his Catholic faith, Maradona donated a signed Argentina jersey to [[Pope Francis]], which is located in one of the [[Vatican Museums]].]]
Born to a [[Roman Catholic]] family, his parents are Diego Maradona Senior and Dalma Salvadora Franco.  Maradona married long-time fiancée Claudia Villafañe on 7 November 1984 in Buenos Aires, and they had two daughters, Dalma Nerea (born 2 April 1987) and Gianinna Dinorah (born 16 May 1989), by whom he became a grandfather in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=La Liga |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/722/la-liga/2009/02/19/1117562/diego-maradona-becomes-a-grandfather-as-sergio-aguero-junior-is-b |title=Diego Maradona Becomes A Grandfather As Sergio Aguero Junior Is Born |publisher=Goal.com |date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maradona and Villafañe divorced in 2004. Daughter Dalma has since asserted that the divorce was the best solution for all, as her parents remained on friendly terms. They travelled together to Naples for a series of homages in June 2005 and were seen together on other occasions, including the Argentina games during [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/story?id=334497 ESPN Deportes – "Llega en son de paz"]. ESPN. Retrieved 19 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

During the divorce proceedings, Maradona admitted he is the father of [[Diego Sinagra]] (born in Naples on 20 September 1986). The Italian courts had already ruled so in 1993, after Maradona refused to undergo DNA tests for proving or disproving his paternity. Diego Junior met Maradona for the first time in May 2003 after tricking his way onto a golf course in Italy where Maradona was playing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/story?id=334523 ESPN Deportes – "El amor al ídolo"].

===Political views===
[[File:Maradona y Kirchner.jpg|thumb|right|Maradona presents a signed shirt to the former President of Argentina [[Néstor Kirchner]] in December 2007.]]
Having previously been vocal in his support of [[neoliberal]] Argentine President [[Carlos Menem]] and his [[Harvard University]]-educated economist [[Domingo Cavallo]], Maradona has shown sympathy to [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] ideologies. He became friends with Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]] while receiving treatment on the island, with Castro stating, "Diego is a great friend and very noble, too. There's also no question he’s a wonderful athlete and has maintained a friendship with Cuba to no material gain of his own."&lt;ref name="Maradona FIFA"/&gt; He has a portrait of Castro [[tattoo]]ed on his left leg and one of Fidel's second in command, fellow Argentine [[Che Guevara]] on his right arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/argentina/story/0,,1635417,00.html |title=A big hand |work=The Observer |location=UK |accessdate=19 June 2006 |date=6 November 2005 | first=Chris | last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, ''El Diego'', he dedicated the book to various people, including Castro.

Maradona was also a supporter of former Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]]. In 2005, he came to Venezuela to meet Chávez, who received him in the [[Miraflores Palace]]. After this meeting, Maradona claimed that he had come with the aim of meeting a "great man" ("''un grande''" in Spanish), but he had met instead a gigantic man ("''un gigante''" in Spanish, meaning he was more than great).

In the Argentine film ''[[Son of the Bride|El Hijo de la Novia]]'' ("Son of the Bride"), somebody who impersonates a [[Priest#Catholic and Orthodox|Catholic priest]] says to a bar patron, "They idolized him and then crucified him." When a friend scolds him for taking the prank too far, the fake priest retorts, "But I was talking about Maradona." He is the subject of the film ''[[El Camino de San Diego]]'', though he himself only appears in archive footage.

Maradona was included in many [[cameo appearance|cameo]]s in the Argentine comic book [[El Cazador de Aventuras]]. After the closing of it, the authors started a new short-lived comic book titled "El Die",&lt;!-- Note: This is not a mistake, the comic book was actually called "El Die", not "El Diez", which would had been correct under grammatical rules. The "mistake" in the title was done on purpose, for humoristic reasons --&gt; using Maradona as the main character. Maradona has had several online Flash games that are entirely dedicated to his legacy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130706014409/http://www.soccergamespot.com/world-cup-games/maradona "Maradona Soccer Game"]. Retrieved 13 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], Argentina, locals organized the [[parody religion]] of the "[[Iglesia Maradoniana|Church of Maradona]]". The organization reformulates many elements from Christian tradition, such as Christmas or prayers, reflecting instead details from Maradona. It had 200 founding members, and tens of thousands more have become members via the church's official web site.&lt;ref&gt;

Many Argentine artists performed songs in tribute to Diego, such as "Maradó" by [[Rodrigo Bueno|El Potro Rodrigo]], "Maradona" by [[Andrés Calamaro]], "Para siempre Diego" (Diego forever) by [[Los Ratones Paranoicos]], "Francotirador" (Sniper) by [[Attaque 77]], "Maradona blues" by [[Charly García]], "Santa Maradona" (Saint Maradona) by [[Mano Negra]], "La Vida Tombola" by [[Manu Chao]], among others. There are also films, such as: ''Maradona, La Mano de Dios'' (Maradona, the Hand of God), ''El Camino de San Diego'' (Saint Diego's Road), ''Amando a Maradona'' (Loving Maradona), ''[[Maradona by Kusturica]]''.&lt;ref name="Film"/&gt;

By 1982, Maradona had become one of the biggest sports stars in the world and had endorsements with many companies, including [[Puma SE|Puma]] and [[Coca-Cola]], earning him an additional $1.5 million per year on top of his club salary.&lt;ref name="commercial"/&gt; In 1982, he featured in a World Cup commercial for Coca-Cola, and a Japanese commercial for Puma.&lt;ref name="commercial"&gt;Jimmy Burns (2011) "Maradona: The Hand of God". pp. 71, 84.

[[File:NIG-ARG (11).jpg|thumb|left|Banners depicting Maradona – such as this where he features alongside [[Lionel Messi]] at the 2018 World Cup – often appear at Argentina games]]
A 2006 television commercial for Brazilian soft drink [[Guaraná Antarctica]] portrayed Maradona as a member of the Brazil national team, including wearing the yellow jersey and singing the Brazilian national anthem with Brazilian players [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] and [[Kaká]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archivo10.com/videos/maradona_videos07.html|title=ARCHIVO 10, Diego Maradona – Videos de publicidades|publisher=Archivo10.com|accessdate=6 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707155707/http://www.archivo10.com/videos/maradona_videos07.html|archive-date=7 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on in the commercial he wakes up realizing it was a nightmare after having drunk too much of the drink. This generated some controversy in the Argentine media after its release (although the commercial was not supposed to air on the Argentine market, fans could see it online). Maradona replied that he has no problem in wearing the Brazilian national squad jersey despite [[Argentina and Brazil football rivalry|Argentina and Brazil having a tense rivalry in football]], but that he would refuse to wear the shirt of [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]], [[Boca Juniors]]' [[Superclásico|traditional rival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adnews.com.br/publicidade.php?id=28306 |title=Maradona diz não se arrepender de usar camisa do Brasil na TV |date=30 April 2006 |work=AdNews.com.br |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706151608/http://www.adnews.com.br/publicidade.php?id=28306 |archivedate=6 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a documented phenomenon of Brazilians being named in honour of Maradona,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Cup 2014: Brazilians named after Maradona and Lineker|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27971359|accessdate=1 February 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an example being footballer [[Diego Costa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burt|first1=Jason|title=Diego Costa: I take things to limit but I did nothing wrong|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/11381605/Diego-Costa-I-take-things-to-limit-but-I-did-nothing-wrong.html|accessdate=31 January 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Duncan Walker Bannatyne''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 2 February 1949),&lt;ref name="DBinterview"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/feb/18/broadcasting.comment|title=Duncan Bannatyne interview|last=Barber|first=Lynn|date=18 February 2007|work=[[The Observer]]|accessdate=10 November 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]], [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]] and author. His business interests include hotels, health clubs, spas, media, TV, and property. He is most famous for his appearance as a [[business angel]] on the [[BBC]] programme ''[[Dragons' Den (UK)|Dragons' Den]]''. He was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for his contribution to charity. He has written seven books.

==Early life==

Bannatyne was born in [[Dalmuir]] west of [[Glasgow]]. His father Bill had served in the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] in [[World War II]] and worked on the [[Burma Railway]] after being captured by the Japanese following the [[Battle of Singapore|Fall of Singapore]], he then worked in the foundry at the Clydebank [[Singer Corporation|Singer]] plant. As a child Duncan lived in one room with his parents and siblings in a large house shared with six other families. He attended Dalmuir Primary School where he displayed a talent for arithmetic and won a place at [[Clydebank High School]] after passing the [[Eleven plus exam]]. Most pupils owned a bicycle so he resolved to earn the money to buy one for himself. The local newsagent was not interested in employing him so she challenged him to find 100 new customers in return for a paper round. He called her bluff by returning with 100 names, but later reflected that it would have been more entrepreneurial to have sold the list. He only enjoyed [[Physical education|PE]] and woodwork at the High School and left at 15 without any qualifications.&lt;ref name=Autobiography&gt;{{cite book|date=3 September 2007|author=Duncan Bannatyne|isbn=0-7528-8189-2|title=Anyone Can Do It:My Story|publisher=Orion Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, after a few weeks working for a local [[cabinet-maker]] he joined the [[Royal Navy]], initially enlisting for twelve years as a junior second class engineering mechanic ([[Stoker (occupation)|stoker]]) at [[RNTE Shotley]] near [[Ipswich]], better known as the boys' training establishment HMS ''Ganges''. He served in the Navy for several years including a spell on the aircraft carrier HMS ''[[HMS Eagle (R05)|Eagle]],'' before throwing an officer off a boat landing jetty in Scotland and receiving a [[dishonourable discharge]]. In his autobiography he claims this was in part a reaction to this officer's abuse of his authority, in part a dare by his shipmates and in part a way of getting out of the Navy, with which he had become disillusioned. Bannatyne was nineteen when this happened. After the incident he had to serve nine months in [[Colchester]] military detention centre.&lt;ref name=Autobiography /&gt; He later spent ten days in Glasgow's [[Barlinnie prison]] for not paying a [[pound sterling|£]]10 fine in relation to a charge of [[breach of the peace]] and [[resisting arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundayherald.com/life/people/display.var.2442236.0.0.php |title=In the Dragons' Den with God |publisher=Sunday Herald |date=6 September 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206120928/http://www.sundayherald.com/life/people/display.var.2442236.0.0.php |archivedate=6 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Would I Lie To You Series 1 Episode 1|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8BygaZXsj4&amp;t=8m58s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bannatyne spent his twenties moving from one job to another. Upon his return to Clydebank he trained as an agricultural vehicle fitter and then travelled around the country repairing tractors. He lived on the island of [[Jersey]] for four years from 1974 where he gained an [[Large goods vehicle|HGV]] licence and earned a living through several jobs including deckchair attendant, ice cream seller and hospital porter. He also [[surfing|surfed]], partied and met his first wife on the island. With Jersey's difficult business climate for outsiders, at age 29, Bannatyne and his wife moved to [[Stockton-on-Tees]] in [[North East England]]. He has stated that he was poor and did not have a bank account until the age of 30.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/programmes/genres/entertainment/schedules/2010/07/14 Direct quote from Bannatyne from ''Dragon's Den'', 14 July 2010]. BBC. Retrieved on 28 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

His business career began almost immediately after his move to [[Stockton-on-Tees]] with an ice cream van purchased for £450.&lt;ref name="bannatyne1"&gt;[http://www.bannatyne.co.uk/about-duncan About Duncan - The Bannatyne Group&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He soon expanded by buying more vans during the period of the [[Glasgow Ice Cream Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2900560/Business-profile-Duncan-is-ready-for-his-close-up.html|title=Business profile: Duncan is ready for his close-up|date=28 November 2004|accessdate=3 August 2011|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sold the business for £28,000, founding a [[nursing home]] business called Quality Care Homes which he then sold for £26 million&lt;ref name="bannatyne1"/&gt; in 1997 and children's nursery chain Just Learning for £12 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.darlingtonandstocktontimes.co.uk/leisure/weekendtimes/feature/display.var.1004496.0.driven_restless_and_a_bit_arrogant_but_definitely_not_the_retiring_kind.php|title=Driven Restless And A Bit Arrogant But Definitely Not The Retiring Kind |work=Darlington and Stockton Times |date=4 November 2006 |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Just Learning [[chief executive]] during the 1992–97 period was Conservative MP [[Michael Fallon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tiffany |last=Holland|url=http://www.retail-week.com/profile-michael-fallon-minister-for-business/5040550.article|title=Profile: Michael Fallon, Minister for business|publisher=retail-week.com |date=14 September 2012 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bannatyne has since expanded into health clubs, with the Bannatyne Health Club &amp; Spa chain to his name, and also hotels and property. He acquired 26 health clubs from [[Hilton Hotels]] in August 2006 at a price of £92 million.&lt;ref name="bannatyne1" /&gt; The Bannatyne Group is now the largest independent chain of health clubs in the United Kingdom with 71 sites.  The business currently (June 2018) has 46 spas with plans for more, including at its first Northern Ireland-based health club in Belfast &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/northern-ireland/dragons-dens-duncan-bannatyne-opening-gym-in-northern-ireland-36361757.html|title=Dragon's Den's Duncan Bannatyne opening gym in Northern Ireland|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it operates 4 hotels.

His wealth as of 2018, was estimated at £280 million by the [[Sunday Times Rich List 2018|Sunday Times Rich List]].&lt;ref name="sunday times 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/public/richlist/article629845.ece|title=The wealthiest in film and TV|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=20 May 2011|accessdate=1 November 2011|last=Coxon|first=Ian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bannatyne has written seven books: ''Anyone Can Do It'', ''Wake Up and Change Your Life'', ''How to be Smart With Your Money'', ''How to be Smart With Your Time'', ''43 Mistakes Businesses Make'', ''37 Questions Everyone in Business Needs to Answer'', and ''Riding The Storm''.

===Television===
From 2005 until 2015, Duncan was a Dragon on the BBC television series ''[[Dragons' Den (UK TV series)|Dragons' Den]]''. During his time on the show he invested in 36 businesses.

In 2015, Bannatyne took part in the [[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK series 15)|fifteenth series]] of ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]''. His fee for taking part in the show was donated to the [[Operation Smile]] charity.

===Charity works===
Bannatyne received his OBE partly in recognition for his work with charities such as [[Mary's meals]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-12373390 Mary's Meals charity 'feeding 500,000 children a day' - 5 February 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; He has funded several projects over a ten-year period in Romania, including Casa Bannatyne in [[Târgu-Mureş]], a [[hospice]] for orphans with [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] in which he invested £80,000. In March 2008, he established the Bannatyne Charitable Trust  with a personal injection of £1,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sylvia  |last=Morris |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/meandmymoney/article-1630415/Duncan-Bannatyne-Me--money.html |title=Duncan Bannatyne: Me &amp; my money |work=thisismoney.co.uk|date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2008, Bannatyne added his support to the launch of the [[Geared for Giving]] Campaign at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to encourage UK business leaders to set up and promote a Workplace Giving scheme to benefit UK registered charities with tax effective donations through employees' pay. He then helped to promote [[Clydesdale Bank]]'s and [[Yorkshire Bank]]'s efforts to promote the programme through ATM ([[Automated Teller Machine]]) rolls. "They are really going for it, over 20 per cent of their employees are giving money through this system", Bannatyne says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Mills |url=https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2010/dec/16/duncan-bannatyne-geared-for-giving |title=A charitable dragon: Why Duncan Bannatyne is geared for giving |work=The Guardian |date=16 December 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August 2008, Bannatyne appeared on television programme ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', raising £20,000 for charity [[Action for Children|NCH]].

He became President of the charity [[No Smoking Day]] in October 2008. The charity runs the annual health awareness campaign&amp;nbsp;– helping people who want to [[Smoking cessation|stop smoking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7406568/Smokers-can-use-Facebook-to-quit.html# |title=Smokers can use Facebook to quit |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 March 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General '''Emilio Madero González''' (8 August 1880 – 16 January 1962) was a Mexican soldier who participated in the [[Mexican Revolution]], and the brother of [[Francisco I. Madero]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Emilio Madero was born in [[Parras]], [[Coahuila]], on 8 August 1880, the sixth son of Francisco Madero Hernández and Mercedes González Treviño.  He was the brother of [[Francisco I. Madero]], the leader of the [[Mexican Revolution]].&lt;ref name="EMG" /&gt;

=== Mexican Revolution ===
He participated in the Madero movement during the [[Mexican Revolution]].  In April 1911 he led the forces which conquered the Mexican state of [[Durango]], capturing [[Mapimí, Durango|Mapimí]], [[Lerdo, Durango|Lerdo]], and [[Gómez Palacio, Durango|Gómez Palacio]].  In May 1911 he led the assault on [[Torreón]], which was a key location to seizing control of the surrounding area.  However, when his [[Maderistas]] finally took the city on 15 May, they were joined by a local mob and [[Torreón massacre|massacred the city's Chinese residents]].  Madero finally managed to bring them under control, but not until 10 hours had passed and over 300 Chinese lay dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacques |first=Leo M. Dambourges |date=Autumn 1974 |title=The Chinese Massacre in Torreon (Coahuila) in 1911 |jstor=40168453 |journal=[[Arizona and the West]] |publisher=[[University of Arizona Press]] |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=233–246 |via=[[JSTOR]] |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had difficulty maintaining control of the area, though, and in June was forced to form a group of loyal men, who he paid [[Mexican peso|$]]1.50 a day, to control rebellious former Maderistas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Katz |first=Friedrich |date=1988 |title=Riot, Rebellion, and Revolution: Rural Social Conflict in Mexico |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwwABAAAQBAJ |location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |page=482 |isbn=0-691-07739-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was then aligned to the [[División del Norte]]&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite book |last=Katz |first=Friedrich |date=1998 |title=The Life and Times of Pancho Villa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAIcq6AJ3OwC |location=Stanford, California |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |isbn=9780804730464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|442, 462}} in 1912 fighting [[Pascual Orozco]] under General [[Victoriano Huerta]] as a Colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=15 May 1912 |title=Federals Occupy Orozco's Camp: General Huerta Advances to Yermo, Recently Headquarters of the Rebels |newspaper=[[San Francisco Call]] |location=San Francisco }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time he was instrumental in saving [[Pancho Villa]] from execution, arguing for his life with Huerta, who wanted him out of the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Reilly |first=Edward S. |author-link1=Tex O'Reilly |date=2012 |title=Roving And Fighting (Adventures Under Four Flags) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=684wP_LjC1gC&amp;pg=PT199&amp;q=Emilio%20Madero#v=snippet&amp;q=Emilio%20Madero&amp;f=false |publisher=JazzyBee Verlag Jürgen Beck |oclc=550664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1921 he had returned to Mexico, and was living on a farm in [[San Pedro, Coahuila|San Pedro]].  Madero and his family went into exile again in 1926.  They spent a year in [[California]] and two in [[Texas]] before returning to Mexico in 1929.&lt;ref name="Gil"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Gil |editor1-first=Carlos B. |date=1992 |title=Hope and Frustration: Interviews with Leaders of Mexico's Political Opposition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=moAq2TPef4YC |location=Wilmington, Delaware |publisher=Scholarly Resources, Inc. |page=122 |isbn=0-8420-2395-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later life ===
He was the leader of the [[Revolutionary Party of National Unification]] until 1940, when he was removed for calling the party "paralyzed" due to lack of communication with leader [[Juan Andreu Almazán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Navarro |first=Aaron W. |date=2010 |title=Political Intelligence and the Creation of Modern Mexico, 1938–1954 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hqvmyUcrXg8C |publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University Press]] |page=69 |isbn=978-0-271-03705-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schlacht bei Kandern 1848.jpg|thumb|Death of Friedrich von Gagern in battle at Kandern]]
'''Friedrich Balduin, Baron von Gagern''' (1794–1848) was a German soldier.

==Life==
He was the eldest of the sons of [[Hans Christoph Ernst von Gagern]]. 
He was born at Weilburg on 24 October 1794. He entered the [[University of Göttingen]], but soon left, and, taking service in the Austrian army, took part in the Russian campaign of 1812, and fought in the following year at Dresden, Kulm and Leipzig. 
He then entered the Dutch service, took part in the campaigns of 1815, and, after studying another year at [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], was member for Luxemburg of the military commission of the German federal diet (1824, 1825). 
In 1830 and 1831 he took part in the Dutch campaign in Belgium, and in 1844, after being promoted to the rank of general, was sent on an important mission to the Dutch East Indies to inquire into the state of their military defences. 
In 1847, he was appointed governor at the Hague, and commandant in South Holland.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Gagern, Hans Christoph Ernst, Baron von|display=Gagern, Hans Christoph Ernst, Baron von s.v. Friedrich Balduin|volume=11|page=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Revolutions of 1848 in Germany|spring of 1848]] he was in Germany, and on the outbreak of the revolutionary troubles he accepted the invitation of the government of Baden to take the command against the insurgent "free companies" (Freischaaren) in the [[Hecker Uprising]] led by [[Friedrich Hecker]]. 
At Kandern, on 20 April, he made a vain effort to persuade the leaders to submit, and was about to order his troops to attack, when he was mortally wounded by the bullets of the insurgents.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''George Horace Gallup Jr.''' (April 9, 1930&amp;nbsp;– November 21, 2011) was an American pollster, writer and executive at [[The Gallup Organization]], which had been founded by his father, [[George Gallup]].&lt;ref name=dfp&gt;{{cite news|title=N.Y. Times reporter Tom Wicker was acclaimed for Kennedy assassination coverage |url=http://www.freep.com/article/20111126/NEWS07/111260407/N-Y-Times-reporter-Tom-Wicker-was-acclaimed-for-Kennedy-assassination-coverage |work=[[Detroit Free Press]] |date=November 26, 2011 |accessdate=November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallup expanded the scope of the [[Gallup Poll]] to encompass a wider variety of topics, ranging from the outlook of American [[young people]] to religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=dfp/&gt;

Much of Gallup's writings and research focused on religion and [[spirituality]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=dfp/&gt; His works included ''The Saints Among Us'', published in 1992, and ''The Next American Spirituality'', published in 2002.&lt;ref name=dfp/&gt;

Born in [[Evanston, Illinois]], Gallup graduated from the [[Lawrenceville School]] in 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrenceville.org/about/history/notable-alumni/index.aspx |title=NOTABLE ALUMNI |publisher=The Lawrenceville School |accessdate=October 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and received a [[bachelor's degree]] in religion from [[Princeton University]] in 1953.&lt;ref name=dfp/&gt; In 1954, Gallup joined his father's polling company, The Gallup Organization, where he worked until his retirement in 2004.&lt;ref name=dfp/&gt; He and his brother, Alec Gallup, became co-chairmen of the company upon their father's death.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Kate|last=Zernike|title=George Gallup Jr., of Polling Family, Dies at 81 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/us/george-gallup-jr-of-polling-family-dies-at-81.html |work=[[New York Times]] |date=November 22, 2011 |accessdate=November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Gallup was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2010. He died in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], on November 21, 2011, at the age of 81.&lt;ref name=dfp/&gt;

He was married to Kingsley Hubby, with whom he had three children. He was a devout Episcopalian, who once considered the ministry but instead served as an active [[layman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/us/george-gallup-jr-of-polling-family-dies-at-81.html|title=George Gallup Jr., of Polling Family, Dies at 81|date=November 23, 2011|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hélène Campbell''' (born April 18, 1991) is a woman from [[Ottawa]] who has raised great awareness for [[organ donations]], largely through documenting her own need for new lungs via [[social media]] and by attracting support from celebrities including [[Justin Bieber]] and [[Ellen DeGeneres]].

==Hélène's story==

Campbell had been diagnosed with asthma at the age of 14. In summer 2011, she could not keep up with friends and after almost collapsing during hiking, she went to see her family doctor. In October 2011, she was diagnosed with advanced [[idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]] and was told she needed a double lung transplant. In September 2011, Hélène's lungs function was only 26% and in October it went down to 24%. Since lung transplants were not done in Ottawa, she had to move to Toronto in January to be placed on the transplant waiting list.

In late March, Hélène's condition was decaying quickly and her lung function was only 7%. On April 4, she had serious difficulty breathing and was admitted to the [[Toronto General Hospital]]. Hélène's lung function was a 6%, and was getting smaller by the minute. Her condition was grave enough that she was almost taken off the list - she was  considered a "high risk patient".  On April 6, Hélène underwent a successful double lung transplant at the Toronto General Hospital.

Since then, she has been working with organizations all over the world to bring awareness to Organ Donation, Giving blood, and bone marrow donation. She is a motivational speaker and is passionate about sharing her experiences with anyone.

==The Hélène Effect==

In January 2012, she started the online campaign #BeAnOrganDonor on [[Twitter]] to get the attention of Canadian popstar [[Justin Bieber]]. After Bieber retweeted her campaign, over 2,000 people in Ontario alone registered to be organ donors.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In March, Campbell was on [[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]] through [[Skype]] to talk about her cause to encourage people to be organ donors and give people like her a second chance. According to [[The Ottawa Sun]], registrations for organ donations in Ottawa have skyrocketed by more than 8,000 since December, and the [[Trillium Gift of Life Network]] (TLGN) attributes it to the "'''Helene Campbell effect'''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ottawasun.com/2012/04/20/organ-donations-up-thanks-to-helene-campbell-effect Organ Donations Up thanks to the Helene Campbell Effect]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hélène got the attention of local media vehicles and politicians, such as [[Lisa MacLeod]]. She also received a [[Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal]], awarded by Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] in recognition of her work in raising awareness of the importance of organ donation on May 23, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helene Campbell gets Diamond Jubilee medal from PM|url=http://m.ctv.ca/topstories/20120523/helene-campbell-diamond-jubilee-medal-120523.html|date=May 23, 2012|publisher=[[CTV Television Network|CTV]].ca|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After doing stand-up comedy for years, he became the host of [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' from 1992-2009. Beginning in September 2009, Leno started a primetime talk show, titled ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'', which aired weeknights at 10:00pm [[Eastern Time|ET]], also on NBC.

After ''The Jay Leno Show'' was cancelled in January 2010 amid a [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|host controversy]], Leno returned to host ''The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'' on March 1, 2010.&lt;ref name="thewrap"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewrap.com/ind-column/new-nbc-breaking-story-13241 |title=Exclusive: Conan, NBC Officially Splitsville (Updated) |first=Josef |last=Adalian |date=January 21, 2010 |work=The Wrap |accessdate=January 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He hosted his last episode of ''The Tonight Show'' on February 6, 2014.

==Career==

===Early career===
Leno made his first appearance on ''The Tonight Show'' on March 2, 1977, performing a comedy routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|rxmXpzcl4MI|Jay Leno's First Appearance on the Tonight Show}} March 2, 1977.

After an uncredited appearance in the 1977 film ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (1977 film)|Fun with Dick and Jane]]'', he played more prominent roles in 1978 in ''[[American Hot Wax]]'' and ''[[Silver Bears]]''. Other films and television series from that period include ''Almost Heaven'' (1978), "Going Nowhere" (1979) from ''[[One Day at a Time]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'' (1979), ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]'' (1981), "The Wild One" (1981) from ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', and both "Feminine Mistake" (1979) and "Do the Carmine" (1983) from ''[[Laverne &amp; Shirley]]''. Leno's only starring film role was the 1989 direct-to-video ''[[Collision Course (1989 film)|Collision Course]]'', opposite [[Pat Morita]]. He also appeared numerous times on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.

===''The Tonight Show''===
[[File:Jay Leno (1993) by Alan Light.jpg|thumb|upright|right|200px|Leno in 1993, in the year after becoming host of ''The Tonight Show'']]
Starting in 1987, Leno was a regular substitute host for [[Johnny Carson]] on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. In 1992, he replaced Carson as host&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Carson cuts appearances|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NQMIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SzYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5008,192179&amp;dq=tonight+jay-leno+shandling|agency=Associated Press|work=Rome News-Tribune|location=Rome, Ga.|page=14|date=June 2, 1987|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; amid controversy with [[David Letterman]], who had been hosting ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' since 1982 (aired after ''The Tonight Show''), and whom many—including Carson himself—had expected to be Carson's successor. The story of this turbulent transition was later turned into [[The Late Shift (book)|a book]] and [[The Late Shift (film)|a movie]]. Leno continued to perform as a stand-up comedian throughout his tenure on ''The Tonight Show''.

In 2004, Leno signed a contract extension with [[NBC]] which would keep him as host of ''The Tonight Show'' until 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC signs Jay Leno to contract extension|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-03-30-leno-contract-extended_x.htm |agency=Associated Press|work=USA Today|date=March 31, 2004|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2004, [[Conan O'Brien]] signed a contract with NBC under which O'Brien would become the host of ''The Tonight Show'' in 2009, replacing Leno at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bill|last=Carter|title=Conan O'Brien to Succeed Jay Leno in 2009, NBC Announces|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/27/business/media/28CND-NBC.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position= |work=The New York Times|date=September 27, 2004|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike]], Leno was accused of violating WGA guidelines by writing his own monologue for ''The Tonight Show''. While NBC and Leno claim there were private meetings with the WGA where there was a secret agreement allowing this, the WGA denied such a meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/lenowga-whats-the-real-story-nbc-claims-jay-asked-for-received-wga-permission-to-write-monologue-at-monday-meeting-with-verrone-et-al/|title=LENO/WGA: WHAT'S THE REAL STORY? NBC Claims Jay Asked For &amp; Received WGA Permission To Write Monologue At Secret Monday Meeting With Verrone|publisher=Deadline Hollywood Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leno answered questions in front of the [[Writers Guild of America, West]] trial committee in February 2009 and June 2009, and when the WGAW published its list of strike-breakers on August 11, 2009, Leno was not on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2009/08/guild-clears-jay-leno-of-violating-strike-rules.html | title = WGA: No chin music for Jay Leno | work = Company Town | first = Richard | last = Verrier | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = August 11, 2009 | accessdate = August 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007189.html?categoryId=2821&amp;cs=1 | title = Jay Leno cleared of strike violations; WGA West issues penalties in three cases | first = Cynthia | last = Littleton | date = August 11, 2009 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | location = New York City | publisher = [[Reed Business Information]] | accessdate = August 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leno said in 2008 that he was saving all of his income from ''The Tonight Show'' and living solely off his income from stand-up comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-07-16-leno-cover_N.htm|title=Jay Leno Gears up for Life After 'Tonight'|last=della Cava|first=Marco|date=July 17, 2008|work=USA Today|accessdate=April 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, 2009, Leno checked himself into a hospital with an undisclosed illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/TV/04/23/leno.hospitalized/index.html | title = Jay Leno hospitalized; 'Tonight Show' tapings canceled | first = Jack | last = Hannah | work = [[CNN.com]] | date = April 23, 2009 | publisher = [[Cable News Network]] | accessdate = August 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released the following day and returned to work on Monday, April 27. The two subsequently cancelled ''Tonight Show'' episodes for April 23 and 24 were Leno's first in 17 years as host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/04/24/2009-04-24_rep_jay_leno_hospital_trip_precautionary_late_night_host_to_be_released_friday.html|title=Jay Leno released from the hospital|publisher=NYDailyNews|accessdate=April 24, 2009 | location=New York | first=Nancy | last=Dillon | date=April 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cacom-reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/News/Leno+misses+first+show+years/1530668/story.html |title=Jay Leno misses first show in 17 years |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=April 24, 2009 |work=[[Canada.com]] |publisher=[[Canwest Publishing Inc.]] |location=[[Winnipeg]], Manitoba |accessdate=August 14, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the illness that caused the absence was not disclosed, but later Leno told People magazine that the ailment was exhaustion.&lt;ref name="cacom-reuters" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20276256,00.html | title = Jay Leno Reveals Mystery Ailment: Exhaustion | date = May 1, 2009 | work = [[People.com]] | first = Pamela | last = Warrick | publisher = [[Time Inc.]] | accessdate = August 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Michael Jackson trial====
During the [[Trial of Michael Jackson|2005 trial of Michael Jackson]] over allegations of child molestation, Leno was one of a few celebrities who appeared as a defense witness. In his testimony regarding a call by the accuser, Leno testified that he never called the police, that no money was asked for, and there was no coaching – but that the calls seemed unusual and scripted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/jackson/052405_ctv.html|title=Comedians Jay Leno and Chris Tucker testify for Michael Jackson|publisher=[[Court TV]]|date=May 24, 2005|author=Sweetingham, Lisa |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315195750/http://www.courttv.com/trials/jackson/052405_ctv.html |archivedate= March 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JayLeno.jpg|thumb|right|Leno in 2006]]
As a result, Leno was initially not allowed to tell jokes about Jackson or the case, which had been a fixture of ''The Tonight Show''{{'}}s opening monologue in particular. But he and his show's writers used a legal loophole by having Leno briefly step aside while stand-in comedians took the stage and told jokes about the trial. Stand-ins included [[Roseanne Barr]], [[Drew Carey]], [[Brad Garrett]], and [[Dennis Miller]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0503/08/sbt.01.html|title=Nemcova Speaks Out on Surviving Tsunami; Michael Jackson`s Trial Continues; Interview With Kevin Costner |series=[[Showbiz Tonight]]|publisher=CNN|airdate=March 8, 2005|first=Karyn|last=Bryant}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gag order was challenged, and the court ruled that Leno could continue telling jokes about the trial as long as he did not discuss his testimony. Leno celebrated by devoting an entire monologue to Michael Jackson jokes.

===Succession by Conan O'Brien and ''The Jay Leno Show''===
{{Main|The Jay Leno Show}}
Because Leno's show continued to lead all late-night programming in the [[Nielsen ratings]], the pending expiration of Leno's contract led to speculation about whether he would become a late-night host for another network after his commitment to NBC expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Frazier |last=Moore |title=NBC's Jay Leno-Conan O'Brien swap prompts rumors |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/fanfare/nbc-s-jay-leno-conan-o-brien-swap-prompts-rumors-1.881678 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216165209/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/fanfare/nbc-s-jay-leno-conan-o-brien-swap-prompts-rumors-1.881678 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 16, 2013 |agency=Associated Press |work=Newsday |date=May 14, 2008 |accessdate=June 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leno left ''The Tonight Show'' on Friday, May 29, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bill|last=Carter|title=Date Is Set for Leno's 'Tonight' Finale|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/arts/television/22late.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/T/Television|work=The New York Times|date=July 22, 2008|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/30/arts/television/30leno.html?em|title=Jay Leno Takes Final Bow on 'Tonight Show' |date=May 30, 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 30, 2009 | first=Bill | last=Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Conan O'Brien took over on June 1, 2009.

On December 8, 2008, it was reported that Leno would remain on NBC and move to a new hour-long show at 10 p.m. Eastern Time (9 p.m. Central Time) five nights a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/09/business/media/09leno.html?em|title = Where Is Leno Going?

Jay Leno's new show, titled ''The Jay Leno Show'', debuted on September 14, 2009. It was announced at the [[Television Critics Association]] summer press tour that it would feature one or two celebrities, the occasional musical guest, and keep the popular "Headlines" segments, which would air near the end of the show. First guests included [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Oprah Winfrey]] (via satellite), and a short sit-down with [[Kanye West]] discussing his controversy at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]], which had occurred the night before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshark.com/read/?art=arc3888|title=Pop Minute - Jay Leno Reveals What To Expect From His New Primetime Show|work=tvshark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeslot conflict and return to ''The Tonight Show''===

In their new roles, neither O'Brien nor Leno succeeded in delivering the viewing audiences the network anticipated. On January 7, 2010, multiple media outlets reported that beginning March 1, 2010, Jay Leno would move from his 10 p.m. weeknight time slot to 11:35&amp;nbsp;p.m., due to a combination of pressure from local affiliates whose newscasts were suffering, and both Leno's and O'Brien's poor ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/01/future-for-nbcs-the-jay-leno-show-is-up-in-the-air.html |title= Future For NBC's Tonight Show Up In The Air| work= [[Los Angeles Times]]'' blog''| date= January 2010| access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= access&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.accesshollywood.com/articles/jay-leno-heading-back-to-late-night-conan-obrien-weighing-options-80698/ | website= accesshollywood.com| title= Jay Leno Heading Back To Late Night, Conan O’Brien Weighing Options| date= January 8, 2010| access-date= January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leno's show would be shortened from an hour to 30 minutes. All NBC late night programming would be preempted by the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] between February 15 and 26. This would move ''The Tonight Show'' to 12:05&amp;nbsp;a.m., a post-midnight timeslot for the first time in its history. O'Brien's contract stipulated that NBC could move the show back to 12:05&amp;nbsp;a.m. without penalty (a clause put in primarily to accommodate sports preemptions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| authorlink= Nikki Finke| last= Finke| first= Nikki| date= January 7, 2010| work= Deadline.com | url= http://www.deadline.com/hollywood/nbc-indicates-changes-coming-to-jay-leno-show-due-to-affiliate-issues/ |title= NBC ON THE HOT SEAT: Will It Be Jay AND Conan In Late Night?

''The Tonight Show'' at 12:05 simply isn't ''The Tonight Show.''"

On January 21, it was announced that NBC had struck a deal with O'Brien. It was decided that O'Brien would leave ''The Tonight Show''. The deal was made that O'Brien would receive a $33 million payout and that his staff of almost 200 would receive $12 million in the departure.

On July 1, 2010, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that total viewership for Jay Leno's ''Tonight Show'' had dropped from 5 million to 4 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. Although this represented the lowest second-quarter ratings for the show since 1992, ''Tonight'' was still the most-watched late night program, ahead of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Nightline]]'' (3.7 million) and ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' (3.3 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118021316.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|title='Kimmel,' 'Nightline' show demo increase |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=July 1, 2010 | first=Stuart | last=Levine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Daily Beast |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-10-24/jay-lenos-sinking-tonight-show-ratings-will-conan-obrien-get-the-last-laugh/|accessdate=October 26, 2010|title=Comedians Laugh as Leno Sinks|date=October 24, 2010|first=Gina|last=Piccalo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 2013, NBC announced that Leno would leave ''The Tonight Show'' in spring 2014, with [[Jimmy Fallon]] as his designated successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/tv-column/post/its-official-jimmy-fallon-to-replace-jay-leno-on-the-tonight-show/2013/04/03/3ec85446-9c7e-11e2-9a79-eb5280c81c63_blog.html|title=It's official: Jimmy Fallon to replace Jay Leno on ‘The Tonight Show’|first=Lisa|last=de Moraes|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 3, 2013|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leno sang the "[[Tonight (1956 song)|Tonight]]"'s parody of ''Tonight Show'' with Fallon.

Leno's final show as the host of the Tonight Show was on February 6, 2014 with his final guest [[Billy Crystal]] and musical guest [[Garth Brooks]], along with a few surprise guests, including [[Jack Black]], [[Kim Kardashian]], [[Jim Parsons]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Chris Paul]], [[Carol Burnett]], and [[Oprah Winfrey]].

===Criticism of Leno===
[[File:Jaylenocropped.jpg|right|thumb|Leno on ''The Tonight Show'' in 2005]]
Leno has faced heated criticism and some negative publicity for his perceived role in the [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|2010 ''Tonight Show'' conflict]].&lt;ref name="wsj11510"&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/01/15/why-some-comics-arent-laughing-at-jay-leno-essay/ "Why Some Comics Aren’t Laughing at Jay Leno"].

''Digital Journal''&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Leno stated he did not want O'Brien to leave for a competing network, adding, "I'll be 59 when [the switch occurs], that's five years from now. There's really only one person who could have done this into his 60s, and that was [[Johnny Carson]]; I think it's fair to say I'm no Johnny Carson."&lt;ref name="dj11710" /&gt; Leno also described ''The Tonight Show'' as a [[dynasty]], saying, "You hold it and hand it off to the next person. And I don't want to see all the fighting." At the end of the segment, he said, "Conan, it's yours!

[[Howard Stern]] has also been a harsh critic of Leno before and following his ''Tonight Show'' timeslot change announcement;&lt;ref name="stern"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ2fZH2XqNw&amp;feature=related "Rosie O'Donnell Slams Jay Leno (Part 1 of 2)"]; [[YouTube]]; January 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Stern appeared on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' in 2006, and told O'Brien that he felt it was unlikely that Leno would ever willingly give up ''The Tonight Show'' to anyone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://talkshownews.interbridge.com/2010/01/howard-stern-to-conan-in-2006-i-dont.html "Howard Stern to Conan in 2006: 'I don't see this guy leaving"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221232040/http://talkshownews.interbridge.com/2010/01/howard-stern-to-conan-in-2006-i-dont.html |date=February 21, 2010 }} Talk Show News; January 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; During the conflict, Stern made many negative remarks directed at Leno while on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=FISHER|first1=LUCHINA|title=Howard Stern Gets in Another Dig at Leno|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=7793427|website=ABC News|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to criticism about his handling of the timeslot conflict, Leno has also been criticized for the perceived change in the content of his monologues from his previous stand-up material. Actor and comedian [[Patton Oswalt]] was among the celebrities who openly voiced disappointment with Leno, saying, "Comedians who don't like Jay Leno now, and I'm one of them, we're not like, 'Jay Leno sucks'; it's that we're so hurt and disappointed that one of the best comedians of our generation... willfully has shut the switch off."&lt;ref name="huffpost"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/11/patton-oswalt-weighs-in-o_n_419015.html "Patton Oswalt: Jay Leno Is Like Nixon, I Don't Like Him"].

===Support for Leno===
[[NBC Sports]] chairman and former ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' producer [[Dick Ebersol]] spoke out against all who had mocked Leno, calling them "chicken-hearted and gutless".&lt;ref name="latimes11510"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-leno-backlash16-2010jan16,0,4645138.story "Taking on America's 'nice guy{{'"}}]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Gaspin, then chairman of NBC Universal Television Entertainment, also defended Leno, saying, "This has definitely crossed the line. Jay Leno is the consummate professional and one of the hardest-working people in television. It's a shame that he's being pulled into this."&lt;ref name="latimes11510-2" /&gt; Fellow comedians [[Paul Reiser]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Jim Norton (American comedian)|Jim Norton]] (a frequent contributor to ''The Tonight Show'') also voiced support for Leno.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-reiser/a-teachable-leno-moment_b_418197.html "Paul Reiser: A Teachable Moment"].

Responding to the mounting criticism, Leno said that NBC had assured him that O'Brien was willing to accept the proposed arrangement and that they would not let either host out of his contract.&lt;ref name="e11810"&gt;[http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b162674_jay_tries_make_nice_conan_rallies_troops.html "Jay Leno Tries to Make Nice, While Conan Rallies the Troops"].

He is known for his prominent jaw, which has been described as [[Prognathism#Mandibular prognathism (progenism)|mandibular prognathism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1034/j.1399-0004.1998.5440404.x|last = Chudley|first = A.E.|title = Genetic landmarks through philately – The Habsburg jaw|journal = Clinical Genetics|volume = 54|issue = 4|pages = 283–284|date=October 1998|pmid = 9831338}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Leading with My Chin'', he stated that he is aware of surgery that could reset his mandible, but does not wish to endure a prolonged healing period with his jaws wired shut.

===Charity===
In 2001, he and his wife donated $100,000 to the [[Feminist Majority Foundation]]'s campaign to stop [[gender apartheid]] in Afghanistan, to educate the public regarding the plight of women in Afghanistan under [[Taliban]] rule.

In 2009, he donated $100,000 to a scholarship fund at [[Salem State University|Salem State College]] (now Salem State University) in honor of Lennie Sogoloff, who gave Leno his start at his jazz club, Lennie's-on-the-Turnpike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate= November 29, 2009 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/04/12/leno_says_thanks_with_100k_check |title=Leno says thanks with $100k check |publisher=[[Boston Herald]] |date=April 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110604121114/http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/04/12/leno_says_thanks_with_100k_check |archivedate=June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vehicle collection===

Leno owns approximately 286 vehicles (169 cars and 117 motorbikes).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaylenosgarage.com/the-cars/ The Cars], jaylenosgarage.com&lt;/ref&gt; He also has a website and a TV program called ''[[Jay Leno's Garage]]'', which contains video clips and photos of his car collection in detail, as well as other vehicles of interest to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.jaylenosgarage.com|title = Jay Leno's Garage|website= jaylenosgarage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leno's Garage Manager is Bernard Juchli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://totalcarmagazine.com/features/2013/04/06/ja_leno_garage_pt1/|title = Which way to Jay Leno’s Garage?| website= TotalCarMagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his collection are two [[Doble steam car]]s, a sedan and a roadster that were owned by [[Howard Hughes]], the fifth [[Duesenberg#Model X .281926.E2.80.931927.29|Duesenberg Model X]] known to survive, and one of nine remaining 1963 [[Chrysler Turbine Car]]s.  The collection also includes three antique [[electric car]]s — the 1925 [[Baker Motor Vehicle|Baker Electric]] is his wife Mavis' favorite car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leno|first1=Jay|title=The 100-Year-Old Electric Car|journal=Popular Mechanics|date=April 30, 2007|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a1609/4215940/|accessdate=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has a regular column in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' which showcases his car collection and gives advice about various automotive topics, including restoration and unique models, such as his jet-powered motorcycle and solar-powered hybrid. Leno also writes occasional "Motormouth" articles for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=May 11, 2008| url= http://driving.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/driving/article1746609.ece|title= Jay Leno's million dollar garage |work= The Times|date=May 9, 2007 | location=London | first=Michael | last=Moran}}&lt;/ref&gt; reviewing high-end sports cars and giving his humorous take on motoring matters.

Leno opened his garage to [[Team Bondi]], the company that developed the critically acclaimed 2011 video game ''[[L.A. Noire]]'', which is set in Los Angeles in the late-1940s. Leno's collection contains almost one hundred cars from this period, and allowed the team to recreate their images as accurately as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.giantbomb.com/la-noire/3030-21500/|title = L. A. Noire |work = Giantbomb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
Hosting the 2014 [[Genesis Prize]] award ceremony in [[Jerusalem]], Leno made jokes mocking then-President [[Barack Obama]] and then-Secretary of State [[John Kerry]], accusing Obama of "trying to break" the U.S.'s relationship with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-leno-takes-aim-at-obama-1.5249329|title=Jay Leno Takes Aim at Obama in Jerusalem Awards Ceremony|last=Sommer|first=Allison Kaplan|work=Haaretz|date=May 22, 2014|accessdate=July 15, 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180716042208/https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-leno-takes-aim-at-obama-1.5249329|archivedate=July 16, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 interview with ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', Leno said, "I always considered [[Israel]] as not only the only democracy in the Middle East, I think it’s the purest, because every Israeli voter seems to have his own political party."&lt;ref name=jpost&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/I-like-Jews-but-Italian-food-is-better-406505|title=‘I like Jews, but Italian food is better’|work=Jerusalem Post|date=June 18, 2015|accessdate=July 15, 2018|last=Amouyal|first=Noa}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also added about Israel's relations with other Middle East countries: "Israel is so efficient in defending itself and so good at it, that to the rest of the world it looks like bullying."&lt;ref name=jpost /&gt;

'''Johnnie Colemon''' (February 18, 1920 – December 23, 2014) was the founder of several large organizations within the African-American [[New Thought]] movement, including Christ Universal Temple (CUT)&lt;ref name=Temple&gt;[http://cutemple.org/founder/ Johnnie Colmon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810213152/http://cutemple.org/founder/ |date=2014-08-10 }}, CUT Founder Biography, accessed July 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Universal Foundation for Better Living]] (UFBL).&lt;ref name=UFBL&gt;[http://ufbl.org/ufbl-leadership/ UFBL Leadership, accessed July 21, 2014].&lt;/ref&gt; The Johnnie Colemon Theological Seminary is named in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jctseminary.org/Home.aspx JCTS web site, accessed July 21, 2014.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726233207/http://www.jctseminary.org/Home.aspx |date=July 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan de Oñate y Salazar''' ({{IPA-es|ˈxwan de oˈɲate}}; 1550–1626) was a [[conquistador]] from [[New Spain]], explorer, and [[List of Spanish governors of New Mexico|colonial governor]] of the province of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México]] in the viceroyalty of [[New Spain]]. He led early Spanish expeditions to the [[Great Plains]] and Lower [[Colorado River]] Valley, encountering numerous indigenous tribes in their homelands there. Oñate founded settlements in the province, now in the [[Southwestern United States]].

Today Oñate is known for the 1599 [[Acoma Massacre]]. Following a dispute that led to the death of thirteen Spaniards at the hands of the Acoma, including Oñate's nephew, [[Juan de Zaldívar]], Oñate ordered a brutal retaliation against [[Acoma Pueblo]]. The Pueblo was destroyed.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Background {{!}} The Last Conquistador {{!}} POV {{!}} PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/lastconquistador/background/|website=POV {{!}} American Documentary Inc.|date=22 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 800-1000 Acoma were killed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trujillo|first1=Michael L.|title=Oñate's Foot: Remembering and Dismembering in Northern New Mexico|journal=Aztlan: A Journal of Chicano Studies|date=2008|volume=33|issue=2|pages=91–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 500 or so survivors, at a trial at [[Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico|Ohkay Owingeh]], Oñate sentenced most to twenty years of forced "personal servitude" and additionally mandated that all men over the age of twenty-five have a foot cut off.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He was eventually banished from New Mexico and exiled from Mexico City for five years, convicted by the Spanish government of using "excessive force" against the [[Acoma people]].&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

Today, Oñate remains a controversial figure in New Mexican history: in 1998 the right foot was cut off a statue of the conquistador that stands in [[Alcalde, New Mexico]] in protest of the massacre, and significant controversy arose when a large equestrian statue of Oñate was erected in [[El Paso, Texas]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=400 years later, Acoma protests Spanish cruelty - Timeline - Native Voices|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/timeline/630.html|website=www.nlm.nih.gov|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Temple|first1=Georgia|title=Controversy surrounding 'The Last Conquistador' statue in El Paso topic of documentary|url=http://www.mrt.com/entertainment/article/Controversy-surrounding-The-Last-Conquistador-7486007.php|work=Midland Reporter-Telegram|date=July 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early years===
Oñate was born either in 1550 or 1552, at [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]] in [[New Spain]] (colonial México) to a family of Spanish-Basque colonists and [[silver]] mine owners. His father was the [[conquistador]] and silver baron [[Cristóbal de Oñate]], a descendant of the noble [[house of Haro]]. His mother was Doña Catalina Salazar y de la Cadena who was a descendant by her maternal line of a famous Jewish [[converso]] family, the [[Paul of Burgos|Ha-Levi's]].&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Marc, ''The Last Conquistador:Juan de Oñate and the Settling of the Far Southwest'', University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, Oklahoma, 1991, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; His ancestor Cadena fought in the 1212 [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] in [[Al-Andalus]], and was the first to break through the line of defense protecting Mohammad Ben Yacub. The family was granted another coat of arms, and thereafter were known as "Cadenas".&lt;ref&gt;La Calle de Cadena en Mexico," pps. 1—46, Guillermo Porras Munoz&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan de Oñate married [[Isabel de Tolosa Cortés de Moctezuma]], granddaughter of [[Hernán Cortés]], the conqueror of the [[Aztec Empire|Triple Alliance]], and the great-granddaughter of the [[Aztec]] [[Tlatoani|Emperor]] [[Moctezuma Xocoyotzin]].&lt;ref name=Thrapp&gt;L. Thrapp, Dan ''Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography: G-O'', University of Nebraska Press, 1991, p. 1083&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governship and 1598 New Mexico expedition===
[[File:Texas Historical Marker for Don Juan De Onate and El Paso Del Rio Norte.jpg|thumb|Texas Historical Marker for Don Juan De Onate and El Paso Del Rio Norte]]

In response to a bid by Juan Bautista de Lomas y Colmenares, and subsequently rejected by the King, in 1595 [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]'s Viceroy [[Luis de Velasco, marqués de Salinas|/Luis de Velasco]] selected Oñate from two other candidates to organize the resources of the newly acquired territory.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/kcc/chap3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement with Viceroy Velasco tasked Oñate with two goals; the better-known aim was to explore and colonize the unknown lands annexed into the New Kingdom of León y Castilla (present day [[New Mexico]]) and the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]]. His second goal was to capture Capt. [[Umana and Leyba expedition|Francisco Leyva de Bonilla]] (a traitor to the crown known to be in the region) as he already was transporting other criminals. His stated objective otherwise was to spread [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] by establishing new [[Spanish missions in New Mexico|missions in Nuevo México]]. Oñate is credited with founding the Province of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México]], and was the province's first colonial governor, acting from 1598 to 1610. He held his colonial government at [[Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico|Ohkay Owingeh]], and renamed the pueblo there 'San Juan de los Caballeros'.

In late 1595, the Viceroy [[Gaspar de Zúñiga, 5th Count of Monterrey|de Zúñiga]], followed his predecessor's advice and in the summer of 1596 delayed Oñate's expedition in order to review the terms of the original agreement signed, before the previous Viceroy had left office. In March 1598, Oñate's expedition moved out and forded the [[Rio Grande]] (Río del Norte) south of present-day [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and [[Ciudad Juárez]] in late April.

On the Catholic calendar day of [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension]], April 30, 1598, the exploration party assembled on the south bank of the Rio Grande. In an Ascension Day ceremony, Oñate led the party in prayer, as he claimed all of the territory across the river for the [[Spanish Empire]]. Oñate's original terms would have make this land a separate [[viceroy]]alty to the crown in New Spain; this move failed to stand after de Zúñiga reviewed the agreement.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

All summer, Oñate's expedition party followed the middle Rio Grande Valley to present day [[northern New Mexico]], where he engaged with [[Pueblo Indians]]. [[Gaspar Pérez de Villagrá]], a captain of the expedition, chronicled Oñate's conquest of New Mexico's indigenous peoples in his epic ''Historia de la Nueva México'', published in 1610.&lt;ref&gt;

====Acoma War====
In October 1598, a skirmish erupted when a squad of Oñate's men demanded supplies from the [[Acoma Pueblo]], although the Acoma themselves needed their stored food to survive the coming winter. The Acoma resisted and 11 Spaniards were killed, including Oñate's nephew, [[Juan de Zaldívar (Spanish soldier)|Juan de Zaldívar]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
In January 1599, Oñate condemned the conflict as an uprising and ordered the pueblo destroyed, a mandate carried out by Juan de Zaldívar's brother, [[Vicente de Zaldívar]], in an offensive known as the [[Acoma Massacre]]. An estimated 800-1000 Acoma died in the siege of the pueblo, and the 500 survivors&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; were put on trial and sentenced by Oñate. All men and women older than 12 were enslaved for 20 years. In addition, men older than 25 (24 individuals) had one foot amputated.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Plains Expedition===
In 1601, Oñate undertook a large expedition east to the [[Great Plains]] region of central North America. The expedition party included 130 Spanish soldiers and twelve [[Franciscan]] priests - similar to the expedition of the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] - and a retinue of 130 Indian soldiers and servants. The expedition possessed 350 horses and mules.  Oñate journeyed across the plains eastward from New Mexico in a renewed search for [[Quivira]], the fabled "city of gold." As had the earlier [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado#Expedition|Coronado Expedition]] in the 1540s, Oñate encountered [[Apache]]s in the [[Texas Panhandle]] region.

Oñate proceeded eastward, following the [[Canadian River]] into the modern state of [[Oklahoma]]. Leaving the river behind in a sandy area where his ox carts could not pass, he went across country, and the land became greener, with more water and groves of [[Juglans nigra|Black walnut (''Juglans nigra'')]] and [[Quercus macrocarpa|bur oak (''Quercus macrocarpa'')]] trees.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, Herbert Eugene, ed. Spanish Exploration in the Southwest, 1542-1706.  New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1916, 250-267&lt;/ref&gt;

;Escanjaque people
[[Jusepe Gutierrez|Jusepe]] probably led the Oñate party on the same route he had taken on the [[Umana and Leyba expedition]] six years earlier. They found an encampment of native people that Oñate called the [[Escanjaque Indians|Escanjaques]]. He estimated the population at more than 5,000 living in 600 houses.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, 257&lt;/ref&gt;  The Escanjaques lived in round houses as large as {{convert|90|ft|m}} in diameter and covered with tanned [[buffalo robe]]s. They were hunters, according to Oñate, depending upon the buffalo for their subsistence and planting no crops.

The Escanjaques told Oñate that a large settlement of their enemies, the [[Rayado Indians]], was located only about twenty miles away in a region called [[Etzanoa]]. It seems possible that the Escanjaques had gathered together in large numbers either out of fear of the Rayados or to undertake a war against them. They attempted to enlist the assistance of the Spanish and their firearms, alleging that the Rayados were responsible for the deaths of Humana and Leyva a few years before.

The Escanjaques guided Oñate to a large river a few miles away and he became the first European to describe the [[tallgrass prairie]]. He spoke of fertile land, much better than that through which he had previously passed, and pastures "''so good that in many places the grass was high enough to conceal a horse.''"&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, 253&lt;/ref&gt;  He found and tasted a fruit of good flavor, possibly the [[Asimina triloba|pawpaw]].

;Rayado people
Near the river, Oñate's expedition party and their numerous Escanjaque guides saw three or four hundred Rayados on a hill. The Rayados advanced, throwing dirt into the air as a sign that they were ready for war. Oñate quickly indicated that he did not wish to fight and made peace with this group of Rayados, who proved to be friendly and generous. Oñate liked the Rayados more than he did the Escanjaques.  They were "''united, peaceful, and settled.''"  They showed deference to their [[tribal|chief]], named Caratax, whom Oñate detained as a guide and hostage, although "''treating him well.''"&lt;ref&gt;Vehik, Susan C. "Wichita Culture History," Plains Anthropologist, Vol 37, No. 141, 1992, 327&lt;/ref&gt;

Caratax led Oñate and the Escanjaques across the river to a settlement on the eastern bank, one or two miles from the river. The settlement was deserted, the inhabitants having fled. It contained "''about twelve hundred houses, all established along the bank of another good-sized river which flowed into the large one [the Arkansas].... the settlement of the Rayados seemed typical of those seen by Coronado in Quivira in the 1540s. The homesteads were dispersed; the houses round, thatched with grass, large enough to sleep ten persons each, and surrounded by large granaries to store the corn, beans, and squash they grew in their fields."'' With difficulty Oñate restrained the Escanjaques from looting the town and sent them home.

The next day the Oñate expedition proceeded onward for another eight miles through heavily populated territory, although without seeing many Rayados. At this point, the Spaniards' courage deserted them. There were obviously many Rayados nearby and soon Oñate's men were warned that the Rayados were assembling an army. Discretion seemed the better part of valor.  Oñate estimated that three hundred Spanish soldiers would be needed to confront the Rayados, and he turned his soldiers around to return to New Mexico.

====Return to Nuevo México====
Oñate had worried about the Rayados hurting or attacking his expedition party, but it was instead the Escanjaques who repelled his men on their return to New Mexico. Oñate described a pitched battle with 1,500 Escanjaques, probably an exaggeration, but many Spaniards were wounded and many natives killed. After more than two hours of fighting, Oñate himself retired from the battlefield. The hostage Rayado chief Caratax was freed by a raid on Oñate and Oñate freed several women captives, but he retained several boys at the request of the Spanish priests for instruction in the Catholic faith. The attack may have arisen from Oñate's kidnapping of Caratax and the women and children.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, 264&lt;/ref&gt;

Oñate and his men returned to [[Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico|San Juan de los Caballeros]], arriving there on November 24, 1601&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghosttowns.com/states/nm/yunqueyunque.html&lt;/ref&gt; without any further incidents of note.

====Contemporary studies====
The path of Oñate's expedition and the identity of the Escanjaques and the Rayados are much debated. Most authorities believe his route led down the [[Canadian River]] from Texas to Oklahoma, cross-country to the [[Salt Fork Arkansas River|Salt Fork]], where he found the Escanjaque encampment, and then to the [[Arkansas River]] and its tributary, the [[Walnut River]] at [[Arkansas City, Kansas]] where the Rayado settlement was located. Archaeological evidence favors the Walnut River site.&lt;ref&gt;Hawle, Marlin F. European-contact and Southwestern Artifacts in the lower Walnut Focus Sites at Arkansas City Kansas, Plains Anthropologists, Vol. 45, No. 173, Aug 2000&lt;/ref&gt; A minority view would be that the Escanjaque encampment was on the [[Ninnescah River]] and the Rayado village was on the site of present-day [[Wichita, Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;

Authorities have speculated that the Escanjaques were Apache, [[Tonkawa]], [[Jumano Indians|Jumano]], [[Quapaw]], [[Kaw (tribe)|Kaw]], or other tribes. Most likely they were [[Caddoan]] and spoke a [[Wichita (tribe)|Wichita]] dialect.  We can be virtually certain that the Rayados were Caddoan Wichitas.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Their grass houses, dispersed mode of settlement, a chief named Catarax (''Caddi'' was a Wichita title for a chief),&lt;ref&gt;The Pawnee Indians. George E. Hyde 1951.

However, they were probably not the same people Coronado met. Coronado found Quivira 120 miles north of Oñate's Rayados. The Rayados spoke of large settlements called [[Tancoa]] — perhaps the real name of Quivira — in an area to the north.&lt;ref&gt;Vehik, 22-23&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Rayados were related culturally and linguistically to the Quivirans but not part of the same political entity. The Wichita at this time were not unified, but rather a large number of related tribes scattered over most of [[Kansas]] and Oklahoma, so it is not implausible that the Rayados and Escanjaques spoke the same language, but were nevertheless enemies.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Colorado River Expedition===
[[File:1605 graffiti.jpg|thumb|300px|Oñate's 1605 "signature graffiti" on Inscription Rock, in [[El Morro National Monument]]]]

Oñate's last major expedition went to the west, from New Mexico to the lower valley of the [[Colorado River]].&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, George P., and Agapito Rey, Don Juan de Oñate, Colonizer of New Mexico, University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, 1953; Laylander, Don, "Geographies of Fact and Fantasy: Oñate on the Lower Colorado River, 1604-1605," Southern California Quarterly, Vol. 86, No. 4, 2004, 309-324.&lt;/ref&gt; The party of about three dozen men set out from the Rio Grande valley in October 1604. They traveled by way of [[Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico|Zuñi]], the [[Hopi|Hopi pueblos]], and the [[Bill Williams River]] to the Colorado River, and descended that river to its mouth in the [[Gulf of California]] in January 1605, before returning along the same route to New Mexico. The evident purpose of the expedition was to locate a port by which New Mexico could be supplied, as an alternative to the laborious overland route from New Spain.

The expedition to the lower Colorado River was important as the only recorded European incursion into that region between the expeditions of [[Hernando de Alarcón]] and [[Melchior Díaz]] in 1540, and the visits of [[Eusebio Francisco Kino]] beginning in 1701. The explorers did not see evidence of prehistoric [[Lake Cahuilla]], which must have arisen shortly afterwards in the [[Salton Sink]].

They mistakenly thought that the [[Gulf of California]] continued indefinitely to the northwest, giving rise to a belief that was common in the 17th century that the western coasts of an [[Island of California]] were what was seen by sailing expeditions in the Pacific.

====Native peoples====
Native groups observed living on the lower Colorado River, were, from north to south, the [[Mohave people|Amacava (Mohave)]], [[Bahacecha]], [[Piman languages|Osera (Pima)]], at the [[confluence]] of the [[Gila River]] with the Colorado, in a location later occupied by the [[Quechan]], [[Halchidhoma|Alebdoma]].

Seen by Oñate below the Gila junction but subsequently reported upstream from there, in the area where Oñate had encountered the [[Coguana]], or Kahwans, Agalle, and Agalecquamaya, or [[Halyikwamai]], and the [[Cocopah]].

Concerning areas that the explorers had not observed directly, they gave fantastic reports about races of human and areas said to be rich in gold, silver, and pearls.

==Later life==
In 1606, Oñate was recalled to Mexico City for a hearing regarding his conduct. After finishing plans for the founding of the town of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fé]], he resigned his post and was tried and convicted of cruelty to both natives and colonists. He was banished from New Mexico for life and exiled from Mexico City for 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/pov/lastconquistador/background/&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually Oñate went to Spain, where the [[Spanish monarchy|king]] appointed him head of all mining inspectors in Spain. He died in Spain in 1626. He is sometimes referred to as "the Last [[Conquistador]]."&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Marc, The Last Conquistador: Juan de Oñate and the Settling of the Far Southwest, University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, Oklahoma, 1991, book title&lt;/ref&gt;

Oñate is honored by some for his exploratory ventures but is vilified by others for his cruelty to the [[Keres people]] of [[Acoma Pueblo]].

[[Oñate High School]] in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]] and Oñate Elementary School in [[Gallup, New Mexico]] are named after Juan de Oñate. The historic central business district of [[Española, New Mexico]] is named Paseo de Oñate, also known as Oñate Street.

In 1614, Oñate was exiled from what is now New Mexico and charged with mismanagement and excessive cruelty, especially at the [[Acoma massacre]] at [[Acoma Pueblo]] where, in 1599, after killing 500 warriors and 300 women and children, he ordered the right foot be chopped off of all surviving Acoma warriors. 24 men suffered this fate. Males between the ages of 12 and 25 were also enslaved for 20 years, along with all of the females above the age of 12. When King Phillip of Spain heard the news of the massacre and punishments, Oñate was brought on 30 charges of mismanagement and excessive cruelty in suppressing Indian uprisings. He was found guilty of cruelty, immorality, and false reporting and returned to Spain to live out the remainder of his life. 2014 marked the 400th anniversary of Juan de Oñate's exile from New Mexico. Despite his atrocities, Oñate is still celebrated today at the Española Valley Fiestas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://greenfiretimes.com/2014/08/remembering-400-years-of-exile/#.VaAazvlVhBc | title = Remembering 400 Years of Exile | author = Matthew J. Martinez | date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Center]] (until 2017 the Oñate Monument and Visitor Center) in [[Alcalde, New Mexico]] is a 1991 bronze statue dedicated to the man. In 1998 New Mexico celebrated the 400th anniversary of his arrival. Shortly before (December 29, 1997), and the close dates are no coincidence, unknown perpetrator(s) cut off the statue's right foot&lt;ref name="nyt02"&gt;Ginger Thompson. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E6DE1138F934A25752C0A9649C8B63 "As a Sculpture Takes Shape in Mexico, Opposition Takes Shape in the U.S.,"] ''The New York Times'', January 17, 2002. Retrieved 2008-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt; and left a note saying, "Fair is fair." Sculptor Reynaldo Rivera recast the foot, but a seam is still visible. Some commentators suggested leaving the statue maimed as a symbolic reminder of the foot-amputating [[Acoma Massacre]]. A local filmmaker, [[Chris Eyre]], was contacted by one of the two perpetrators, saying "I'm back on the scene to show people that Oñate and his supporters must be shamed." Eyre is working on a documentary "about the incident and what it reveals about racism in New Mexico."

In 2017 the statue's left foot was painted red, and the words "Remember 1680" (year of the [[Pueblo revolt]]) were written with paint on the monument's base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 1997, the City of [[El Paso]] hired a sculptor, [[John Sherrill Houser]], to create a [[statue]] of the conquistador. In reaction to protests, two city councilmembers retracted their support for the project;&lt;ref name="nyt02"/&gt; The [[US$|$]]2,000,000 statue took nearly nine years to build and was stationed in the sculptor's Mexico City warehouse. The statue was completed in early 2006. In pieces and transported on flatbed trailers, it was brought to El Paso during the summer and was installed in October. The controversy over the statue prior to its installation was the subject of the documentary film ''The Last Conquistador'', presented in 2008 as part of [[PBS]]' ''[[P.O.V.]]'' television series.&lt;ref name="pov"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/pov/lastconquistador/ POV - The Last Conquistador]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vimeo: [https://vimeo.com/25785588 ''The Last Conquistador'']&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The City of El Paso unveiled the eighteen [[ton]], {{convert|34|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} statue in a ceremony on April 21, 2007.  Oñate is mounted atop his [[Andalusian horse]] while holding the [[La Toma]] declaration in his right hand. The statue was welcomed by segments of the local population and also by the Spanish Ambassador to the United States, [[Carlos Westendorp]]. According to Houser, it is the largest and heaviest (bronze) equestrian statue in the world. Acoma tribal members from New Mexico were present and protested the statue.

'''''Life's Too Short''''' is a British sitcom [[mockumentary]] created and written by [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]], from an idea by [[Warwick Davis]], about "the life of a showbiz [[Dwarfism|dwarf]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-09-02/warwick-davis-lifes-too-short-could-come-back|title=Warwick Davis: Life’s Too Short could come back |work=Radiotimes|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis plays a fictionalised version of himself, and both Gervais and Merchant appear in supporting roles as themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/02/17/tv-weekend-lifes-too-short/|title=TV Weekend:Life's Too Short|work=Entertainment Time|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show began airing on [[BBC Two]] on 10 November 2011.

In January 2013, it was announced that ''Life's Too Short'' would end later in the year with a special that would bring the series' closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/01/lifes-too-short-to-end-hbo-run-with-special/ |title='Life's Too Short' To End HBO Run With Special |publisher=Deadline |date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one-hour special aired on 30 March 2013 in the UK and 5 July 2013 in the US.

==Background==
The genesis of the show came when Davis worked with Gervais and Merchant in an episode of the second series of ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'', when he co-starred with [[Daniel Radcliffe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collider.com/warwick-davis-to-star-in-ricky-gervais-and-stephen-merchants-new-tv-series-lifes-too-short/|title=Warwick Davis to Star in Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant’s New TV Series LIFE’S TOO SHORT|work=Movieweb|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais said that real Warwick is funny and tells great stories and Stephen Merchant commented of Davis that he helped come up with the idea.&lt;ref name=MW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/exclusive-stephen-merchant-on-the-office-and-lifes-too-short|title=EXCLUSIVE: Stephen Merchant on The Office and Life's Too Short|date=13 August 2010|accessdate=17 February 2011|work=Movieweb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais and Merchant approached the BBC about developing a show centred on a character based on Davis.&lt;ref name="THR"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The real Warwick tells us these great stories. They're comedy gold. (The show) is a cross between ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' and ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' and ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]'' but with a dwarf. That is out and out funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/7614380/BBC-to-screen-Ricky-Gervais-sitcom-about-life-of-a-dwarf.html|title=BBC to screen Ricky Gervais sitcom about life of a dwarf|date=22 April 2010|accessdate=16 September 2010|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|work=The Telegraph|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Warwick runs a [[Dwarfism|small person]] talent agency and playing a twisted version of himself, he's quite conceited, arrogant and manipulative. He is doing this documentary to improve his career as he is going through a messy divorce and needs the money. Warwick bugs Rick and Stephen about whether they have any work, much to their annoyance.

In an interview with [[Jonathan Ross]], Davis said that his character is egotistical and suffers from [[Napoleon complex|small man syndrome]],&lt;ref name=YTJR&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdei36KJlnw|title=Warwick Davis talks working with Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant|date=15 May 2010|accessdate=16 September 2010|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais said of the character &lt;blockquote&gt;He refuses to live his life as a disabled person.

Gervais first mentioned ''Life's Too Short'' on his blog in February 2010, when he and Merchant were writing and casting the project.&lt;ref name=RG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rickygervais.com/thissideofthetruthc.php|title=Week one hundred and five – February 2010|work=Blog!|date=February 2010|accessdate=2 May 2012|publisher=Ricky Gervais}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilot for the comedy was commissioned by the [[BBC]] in April 2010.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8635226.stm|title=Ricky Gervais comedy gets BBC green light |date=21 April 2010|accessdate=15 September 2010|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais reported on progress in his blog. In April 2010, he stated, "Some reports are saying that the ''Life's Too Short'' pilot we are shooting in the summer will be aired. It wont {{sic}}. It is a non-broadcast pilot. We will shoot the whole series before anything is aired. We're not sure how many eps [episodes] we will record (probably 6) and not sure when the series will air."

Gervais wrote on his blog in June 2010 "Found the last location today for ''Life's Too Short''. It feels great doing this project. Just like ''The Office'' and ''Extras''. Starting from scratch, just me and Steve in a room crafting a brand new show. It doesn't get better than that for me." He later wrote that filming of the pilot was undertaken in June and July 2010. Gervais commented in July 2010 "Finished the pilot for ''Life's Too Short'' too. Just have to write the series now". The series was produced by [[Charlie Hanson]], who previously produced ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'', and Michelle Farr. The series was executive produced by Gervais and Merchant along with Mark Freeland.&lt;ref name=Var&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118024311.html?refCatId=19|title=BBC greenlights Gervais sitcom 'Life's Too Short' centers on Warwick Davis|date=17 September 2010|accessdate=14 October 2010|publisher=Reed Elsevier Properties Inc|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 September 2010 the BBC announced, via the BBC Two Controller [[Janice Hadlow]], and the Controller of BBC Comedy Commissioning Cheryl Taylor, that the six-part series had been commissioned and filmed in 2011.

In June 2010, while talking at the [[Banff World Media Festival]], Gervais described ''Life's Too Short'' as "the funniest thing we've done." Gervais told ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' "We're having so much fun working with Warwick. Pound for pound he is one of the funniest men I know." Stephen Merchant said of Davis: "Warwick is very funny, a very physical comedian which we really made use of … He's very charismatic, very charming in it … I was really pleased. He's a real comic star in waiting."

Gervais reported in his blog on the progress of writing ''Life's Too Short'' throughout November 2010: "Had a great week writing ''Life's Too Short''. It's the hardest bit, the most important bit and the most invigorating bit", and in a later entry "Wrote one of the funniest sketches we've ever done for ''Life's Too Short''. Six hours hard labour for a potential two minutes screen time." In January 2011 he reported that he was still working on the scripts for the show, and in February that he and Merchant were trying to finish writing ''Life's Too Short''.

In March 2011 Gervais reported on his blog "Getting ready to film ''Life's Too Short''."&lt;ref name=RG/&gt; Merchant confirmed that filming would begin in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-interviews/2011/03/16/beanpole-funnyman-stephen-merchant-hopes-stand-up-lines-will-help-him-bag-a-girlfriend-86908-22993387/|title=Beanpole funnyman Stephen Merchant hopes stand-up lines will help him bag a girlfriend |date=16 March 2011|accessdate=23 March 2011|publisher=Trinity Mirror|work=Daily Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cast members included [[Jo Enright]], who played Warwick Davis' wife in the pilot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaymercury.net/news/midlands-news/2011/03/23/birmingham-comic-jo-enright-s-the-short-star-with-a-big-future-66331-28367592/|title=Birmingham comic Jo Enright's the short star with a big future |date=23 March 2011|accessdate=23 March 2011|publisher=Trinity Mirror|work=Sunday Mercury}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shaun Williamson]], who played himself (known as "[[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry]] off ''[[EastEnders]]''") in ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joshgill.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/an-interview-with-shaun-williamson/|title=An interview with…Shaun Williamson|date=15 March 2011|accessdate=30 May 2011|first=Josh|last=Gill|work=''Josh Gill's Blog'}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cat Deeley]],&lt;ref name=Blanks&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFj_k3GB6Zs|title=Warwick Davis talks Ricky Gervais, Life's Too Short and Cat Deeley, with Brad Blanks |date=6 April 2011|accessdate=30 May 2011|first=Brad|last=Blanks|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rosamund Hanson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2580571/|title=Rosamund Hanson|accessdate=30 May 2011|publisher=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kiruna Stamell]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debiallenassociates.com/clients_detail.asp?id=87 |title=Kiruna Stamell |accessdate=30 May 2011 |publisher=Debi Allen Associates |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007221451/http://www.debiallenassociates.com/clients_detail.asp?id=87 |archivedate= 7 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jamie Dodd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1463165/|title=Jamie Dodd|accessdate=30 May 2011|publisher=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boxer [[Mike Tyson]] also asked Gervais to consider casting him in a role.&lt;ref name=RG/&gt;

On 31 March 2011 Gervais confirmed on his blog that "We've basically got first drafts of all seven episodes of ''Life's Too Short'' now. Yes seven!". As the pilot has already been filmed, the series will comprise eight shows. On 1 April he stated "Started casting ''Life's Too Short'' this week too. So much fun."&lt;ref name=RG/&gt; On 29 April he wrote "Did the last of the casting today on ''Life's Too Short''. Some amazing cameos too. You know about the [Johnny] Depp one, but hopefully we might be able to keep a couple of the other really big ones under wraps. Not just because of the surprise factor but because it takes the focus away from the real meat of the show."&lt;ref name=RG/&gt; On 11 May the cast had their first [[read-through]] of all seven episodes, and rehearsals started on the week beginning 16 May 2011 with Gervais commenting "We've put together an amazing cast so it should be a joy."&lt;ref name=RG/&gt; Filming started on 30 May 2011.&lt;ref name=RG/&gt;

On 22 June 2011 it was announced that [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Steve Carell]] would be filming cameos for the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2011/06/lifes-too-short-carrell-depp-s.shtml|title=Life's Too Short: Big casting SPOILERS|accessdate=22 June 2011|publisher=BBC|work=Comedy Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teaser trailer released on the same day featured [[Keith Chegwin]], [[Les Dennis]] and [[Shaun Williamson]] as well as the three main stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/clips/p00hpzxb/lifes_too_short_lifes_too_short_trailer/|title=Life's Too Short Trailer |accessdate=22 June 2011|publisher=BBC|work=Comedy}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 July Gervais hinted on his blog that a ''[[Doctor Who]]''-related cameo would be in the show, as well as posting a link to a YouTube video of him and Warwick Davis filmed on the set of ''Life's Too Short''.&lt;ref name=RG/&gt; Earlier in that week he had blogged about how "[[Matt Groening]]'s favourite character from ''The Office'' will make a cameo in ''Life's Too Short''", along with an on-set photograph of actor Ewen MacIntosh who played [[Keith Bishop (The Office)|Big Keith]] in ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''.

Principal filming ran for eight weeks ending on 22 July 2011.&lt;ref name=RG/&gt;

Gervais and Davis attended a question and answer session to discuss the making of ''Life's Too Short'' at the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]] in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Saul |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2011/06/bbc-comedy-hits-the-edinburgh.shtml |title=BBC Comedy hits the Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2011 |publisher=BBC|work=Comedy Blog |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A half-hour-long documentary, ''The Making of Life's Too Short'', aired on [[BBC Two]] and [[BBC HD]] on 5 November 2011, prior to the start of the series run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/lifes_too_short/episodes/2011/1/|title=The Making of Life's Too Short|work=Comedy.co.uk|accessdate= 6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first series finished airing, Gervais confirmed via Twitter that a second series had been commissioned for early 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eames |first=Tom |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a357045/ricky-gervais-confirms-lifes-too-short-renewal-idiot-special.html |title=Ricky Gervais confirms 'Life's Too Short' renewal, 'Idiot' special |publisher=Hearst Magazines UK|work=Digital Spy |date=21 December 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Gervais stated on his blog that "We are thinking of going straight to the Xmas Special. Lazier and lazier. Now it's down to ONE series and a special. Ha ha."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rickygervais.com/thissideofthetruthf.php#endofentry646 Blog!] RickyGervais.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===UK critical response===
In the United Kingdom the first series received mostly mixed reviews. Rachel Tarley, of [[Metro (British newspaper)|''Metro'']], described the show as "tripe" while David Butcher of the ''[[Radio Times]]'' introduced his review of episode six with "another week, another queasy mix of comedy and unpleasantness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tarley |first=Rachel |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/reviews/885050-lifes-too-short-represents-grounds-for-a-gervais-merchant-divorce |title=Life's Too Short represents grounds for a Gervais-Merchant divorce |publisher=Associated Newspapers|work=Metro.co.uk |date=15 December 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/lifes_too_short/press/ |title='Life's Too Short' In The Press... |publisher=The British Comedy Guide |accessdate=24 December 2011 |first=David |last=Butcher}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many reviews were deeply critical of the writing – Gwilym Mumford of ''[[The Guardian]]'' felt that writers Gervais and Merchant were "on autopilot," referring to the programme as "strikingly lazy stuff, {{sic|comprised|hide=y| of}} little more than a predictable checklist of taboos and social faux pas,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/dec/07/rev-without-you-anna-friel |title=TV highlights: 08/12/2011 |publisher=Guardian News and Media|work=The Guardian |date=7 December 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2011 |first=Gwilym |last=Mumford |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and journalist for ''[[The Independent]]'' Robert Epstein likewise branded it "shoddily derivative" and potentially degrading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert |last=Epstein |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/lifes-too-short-bbc2-thursday-to-the-manor-reborn-bbc1-thursday-6268423.html |title=Life's Too Short, BBC2, Thursday To the Manor Reborn, BBC1, Thursday |work=The Independent  |date=27 November 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; T.J. Barnard, Associate Editor for WhatCulture!, called the show "a mess. It's aimless, indulgent, self-plagiarizing and cold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/tv/lifes-too-short-the-difficult-third-series.php |title=Life's Too Short: The Difficult Third Series? |work=WhatCulture! |publisher=Obsessed with Film Ltd |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103194400/http://whatculture.com/tv/lifes-too-short-the-difficult-third-series.php |archivedate= 3 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ''Metro''{{'}}s review of episode 7 was slightly more positive saying "''Life's Too Short'' bowed out tonight with an episode that was more than marginally better than the six previous offerings, not only was the plot stronger than in previous weeks, but there were some genuinely funny scenes too, most notably a discussion between Gervais and Merchant about charity. And Steve Brody as Warwick's ineffectual giggly/depressive accountant continued to shine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tarley |first=Rachel |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/885476-lifes-too-shorts-finale-was-too-little-too-late-for-ricky-gervais-fans |title=Life's Too Short's finale was too little, too late for Ricky Gervais fans |publisher=Associated Newspapers|work=Metro.co.uk |date=20 December 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More positive reviews could be found in ''The Telegraph'', where Gerald O'Donovan praised the show for its "belly laughs and cringe-making moments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/5602956/TV-highlights.html |title=Today's TV highlights |publisher=Telegraph Media Group|work=The Telegraph |date=23 December 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Caroline Frost of ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'' applauded both the writing and the acting following the first episode, proclaiming that though it could easily have overreached, "Gervais and Merchant have pulled another one out of the hat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frost |first=Caroline |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/11/10/review-lifes-too-short-warwick-davis_n_1087073.html |title=Review: Life's Too Short – Warwick Davis, Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant, Liam Neeson |work=Huffington Post |date=11 November 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the first episode rated strongly in the UK, the ratings dropped by 40% in the following week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Josh |last=Halliday |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/nov/18/life-s-too-short-audience |title=Life's Too Short sees audience shrink |publisher=Guardian News and Media|work=The Guardian |date=18 November 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the fifth episode the overnight ratings had dropped below a million, to 997,000—35% down on the average audience for its timeslot in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/00000703/lifes_too_short_ratings_nosedive_below_1_million/ |title=Life's Too Short ratings nosedive below 1 million |publisher=The British Comedy Guide |date=9 December 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical reaction to the Easter special was more positive, Dan Owen of ''msn.tv'' said "this Easter special was one of Life's Too Short's better episodes and provided enough laughs and fun to please most viewers." He felt that the special felt like a new pilot for the show that "fixed a few problems."
He felt that Keith Chegwin, Shaun Williamson and Les Dennis were the funniest parts of the hour. Overall he gave the special 3 stars out of five.&lt;ref name="tv.uk.msn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.uk.msn.com/what-to-watch/lifes-too-short-solid-reunion-for-val-kilmer-and-warwick-davis|title=MSN TV - What to watch online and on the box|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Metro'' agreed saying, "there were laughs to be had here, mainly from the antics of Williamson, Chegwin and Dennis."&lt;ref name="tv.uk.msn.com"/&gt;
The Guardian praised the episode and called it "a piece of genius" and admired it for being "done with such a breathtaking boldness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/apr/01/doctor-who-voice-lifes-short | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Sam | last=Wollaston | title=Doctor Who; The Voice; Life's Too Short; The Village – TV review | date=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry Venning of ''The Stage'' gave a positive review of the first series also gave a positive review of the special "My favourite comedy of 2011 enjoyed a last hurrah. Sadly, it looks as though there will be no second series." He felt that Rosamund Hanson provided scene-stealing support as dippy secretary Cheryl.
He concluded that overall ''Life's Too Short'' was "Painfully poignant, beautifully played and constantly inventive, this one-hour special conclusively proved that ''Life’s Too Short''{{'}}s own end was also premature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/tv-radio/2013/04/tv-review-jonathan-creek-its-kevin-lifes-too-short/|title=TV review: Jonathan Creek; It’s Kevin; Life’s Too Short|author=Harry Venning|date=5 April 2013|work=The Stage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US critical response===
In the United States the show received generally positive reviews. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted mean]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the show received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 63, based on 14 reviews, which indicates "Generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name="Metacritic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/lifes-too-short/season-1 |title=Life's Too Short – Season 1 |work=Metacritic |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the show holds a rating of 55% based on 33 critics, with the consensus reading: "''Life's Too Short'' is enjoyably crass, but borrows heavily from Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant's previous work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/life-s-too-short/|title=Life's Too Short|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Dynamic list}}
This article lists the 100 longest-lived current or former [[heads of state]] or [[heads of government]] of [[sovereign state]]s (often a [[president]], [[prime minister]] or [[monarch]]) whose age can be proven beyond reasonable doubt. Leaders are not included if no reliable secondary sources have confirmed that the leader is alive within the last 10 years. Leaders currently in office are in bold on purple, with [[Mahathir Mohamad]] of [[Malaysia]] being the oldest currently-serving head of government and [[Elizabeth II]] of the [[United Kingdom]]{{efn-lg|name=Elizabeth|In 1952, Princess Elizabeth [[proclamation of accession of Queen Elizabeth II|acceded]] as the monarch of seven [[Commonwealth realm]]s. She currently reigns as Queen of 16 [[states headed by Queen Elizabeth II|sovereign states]]—including the United Kingdom. From 1957 to 1983, most of her British colonies attained independence, and some joined the other realms in different years; most states ceased to be a realm upon becoming republics.}} being the oldest currently-serving head of state.

'''Lozen''' (c. 1840-June 17, 1889) was a female warrior and prophet of the Chihenne [[Chiricahua]] [[Apache]]. She was the sister of [[Victorio]], a prominent chief. Born into the Chihenne band during the 1840s, Lozen was, according to legends, able to use her [[Magic (paranormal)|powers]] in battle to learn the movements of the enemy.&lt;ref name="GatewoodKraft2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gatewood|first1=Charles B.|authorlink1=Charles B. Gatewood|last2=Kraft|first2=Louis|title=Lt.

Lozen is a shield to her people".&lt;ref name="Ball2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Eve|title=In the Days of Victorio: Recollections of a Warm Springs Apache|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lddyCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15|date=19 October 2015|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=978-0-8165-3297-1|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victorio's Campaign==
In the 1870s, Victorio and his band of Apaches were moved to the deplorable conditions of the [[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation|San Carlos Reservation]] in [[Arizona]]. He and his followers left the reservation around 1877 and began marauding and raiding, all while evading capture by the military. Lozen fought beside Victorio when he and his followers rampaged against Americans who had appropriated their homeland around west [[New Mexico]]'s [[Black Mountain (Catron County, New Mexico)|Black Mountain]].

As the band fled American forces, Lozen inspired women and children, frozen in fear, to cross the surging [[Rio Grande]]. "I saw a magnificent woman on a beautiful horse—Lozen, sister of [[Victorio]]. Lozen the woman warrior!", remembers James Kaywaykla, a child at the time, riding behind his grandmother. "High above her head she held her rifle. There was a glitter as her right foot lifted and struck the shoulder of her horse. He reared, then plunged into the torrent. She turned his head upstream, and he began swimming".&lt;ref name="Kirchner2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirchner|first=Paul|title=More of the Deadliest Men Who Ever Lived|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74DKAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT99|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Paladin Press|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=978-1-61004-694-7|pages=99–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately, the other women and the children followed her into the torrent. When they reached the far bank of the river, cold and wet but alive, Lozen came to Kaywaykla's mother, [[Gouyen]]. "You take charge, now", she said. "I must return to the warriors", who stood between their women and children and the onrushing cavalry. Lozen drove her horse back across the wild river and returned to her comrades.

According to Kaywaykla, "She could ride, shoot, and fight like a man, and I think she had more ability in planning military strategy than did Victorio." He also remembers [[Victorio]] saying, "I depend upon Lozen as I do [[Nana (Apache)|Nana]]" (the aging patriarch of the band).&lt;ref name="Ph.D.2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ph.D.|first=Barbara Tedlock,|title=The Woman in the Shaman's Body: Reclaiming the Feminine in Religion and Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TPm76j5iPUC&amp;pg=PA264|date=2 September 2009|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-57163-2|pages=264–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in Victorio's campaign, Lozen left the band to escort a new mother and her newborn infant across the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] from [[Mexico]] to the [[Mescalero Apache]] Reservation, away from the hardships of the trail.&lt;ref name="Perdue2001"/&gt;

Equipped with only a rifle, a cartridge belt, a knife, and a three-day supply of food, she set out with the mother and child on a perilous journey through territory occupied by Mexican and [[U.S. Cavalry]] forces. En route, afraid that a gunshot would betray their presence, she used her knife to kill a [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|longhorn]], butchering it for the meat.&lt;ref name="Perdue2001"/&gt;

She stole a Mexican cavalry horse for the new mother, escaping through a volley of gunfire. She then stole a [[cowboy|vaquero]]'s horse for herself, disappearing before he could give chase. She also acquired a soldier's saddle, rifle, ammunition, blanket and canteen, and even his shirt. Finally, she delivered her charges to the reservation.

There, she learned that Mexican and [[Tarahumara|Tarahumara Indian]] forces under Mexican commander [[Joaquin Terrazas]] had killed [[Victorio]] and most of his warriors in the [[Battle of Tres Castillos]], fought on three stony hills in northeastern [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]].&lt;ref name="Perdue2001"/&gt;

==End of Apache Wars and Lozen's later years==
Knowing the survivors would need her, Lozen immediately left the [[Mescalero]] Reservation and rode alone southwest across the desert, threading her way undetected through U.S. and Mexican military patrols. She rejoined the decimated band in the [[Sierra Madre Occidental|Sierra Madre]] (in northwestern [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]), now led by the 74-year-old patriarch [[Nana (chief)|Nana]].

Lozen fought beside [[Geronimo]] after his breakout from the San Carlos reservation in 1885, in the last campaign of the [[Apache wars]]. With the band pursued relentlessly, she used her power to locate their enemies—the U.S. and Mexican cavalries. According to Alexander B. Adams in his book ''Geronimo'', "she would stand with her arms outstretched, chant a prayer to Ussen, the Apaches' supreme deity,&lt;ref name="Chief 1915"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Geronimo |editor=Bartlett|title=Geronimo's Story of His Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AvYaAAAAYAAJ|year=1915|publisher=Duffield|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and slowly turn around." Lozen's prayer is translated in Eve Ball's book ''In the Days of Victorio'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Upon this earth''
On which we live''
Ussen has Power''
This Power is mine''
For locating the enemy.''
I search for that Enemy''
Which only Ussen the Great''
Can show to me.&lt;ref name="Creeden1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Creeden|first=Sharon|title=In Full Bloom: Tales of Women in Their Prime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2DyOCFDrcwC&amp;pg=PA109|year=1999|publisher=August House|isbn=978-0-87483-576-2|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Laura Jane Moore in the book ''Sifters, Native American Women's Lives'': In 1885 Geronimo and Naiche fled their reservation with 140 followers including Lozen after rumors began circulating that their leaders were to be imprisoned at Alcatraz Island. Lozen and Dahteste began negotiating peace treaties.&lt;ref name="Kraft2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kraft|first=Louis|title=Gatewood &amp; Geronimo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8a4Q6AG-c60C|year=2000|publisher=UNM Press|isbn=978-0-8263-2130-5|pages=114–116, 163}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of which was that the Apache leaders would be imprisoned for two years then would have their freedom. The American's leaders dismissed the peace treaty and Lozen and Dahteste continued to negotiate. The Apache rebels believed they had strong resolve until it was revealed all the [[Chiricahua]]s had been rounded up and sent to Florida. If they wanted to rejoin their kin, the Apache needed to head east. The Apache warriors agreed to surrender and laid down their arms. Five days later they were on a train bound to Florida.&lt;ref name="Perdue2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Perdue|first=Theda|title=Sifters: Native American Women's Lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrKvoSe9-LwC&amp;pg=PA100|date=29 March 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803003-4|pages=100–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken into U. S. military custody after Geronimo's final surrender, Lozen traveled as a [[prisoner of war]] to [[Mount Vernon, Alabama|Mount Vernon]] Barracks in [[Alabama]]. Like many other imprisoned Apache warriors, she died in confinement of [[tuberculosis]] on June 17, 1889.&lt;ref name="GatewoodKraft2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stockel2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stockel|first=H.

'''Marcus Charles Illions''' (1871&amp;ndash;1949) was a master carver of wooden [[carousel]] horses and other figures who flourished in the [[Coney Island]] section of the [[New York City]] borough of [[Brooklyn]] in the early 20th Century. ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to him as "the [[Michelangelo]] of carousel carvers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/05/arts/design/05folk.html |author= Schwendener, Martha |title= Sacred Skills Thrive on a Merry-Go-Round |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illions was born in 1870 or 1871,&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;ref name=FlyingHorses/&gt; in [[Lithuania]]&lt;ref name=HallOfFame/&gt;&lt;ref name=FlyingHorses/&gt; becoming a builder of circus wagons&lt;ref name=HallOfFame&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall of Fame, famous figures in Coney Island, Marcus C. Illions|url=http://www.coneyislandhistory.org/index.php?g=hall_of_fame&amp;s=illions|publisher=Coney Island History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; before emigrating to England, where he carved carousel horses.&lt;ref name=Major&gt;{{cite web|title=Major Carousel Builders and Carvers|url=http://carousels.org/Carvers_Builders.html|publisher=National Carousel Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative account in an obituary states that he was actually born in England.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; He came to America in 1888 where he carved for [[Charles I. D. Looff]] and [[William F. Mangels]] in Coney Island before starting his own company, M. C. Illions and Sons Carousell Works, in 1909. His five children were all active in the business from very early ages, in roles that included carver and commercial artist.&lt;ref name=FlyingHorses/&gt; At one time in the early 1900s, ten carousels carved by Illions operated in Coney Island.&lt;ref name=HallOfFame/&gt;

Illions was an exponent of what has become known as the Coney Island style of carousel figure carving, which "is characterized by flamboyant horses, bedecked with jewels and gold and silver leaf".&lt;ref name=Major/&gt; By 1909, Illions' company produced "a new line of horses with explosive, flying manes and powerful, straining bodies, decked out with latticework harnesses and other virtuoso feats of carving".&lt;ref name=FlyingHorses/&gt;

A machine known as Feltman's Carousel is considered by one source to have been Illions' best work.&lt;ref name=HallOfFame/&gt; Though no longer intact, 24 of its horses were incorporated into the [[Flushing Meadows Carousel]] in 1964 and are still in use today.

The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s decreased demand for amusement products and Illions experienced financial problems.  He died broke in 1949.&lt;ref name=HallOfFame/&gt; His legacy includes extant carousels across the [[United States]] which are listed here:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Census|url=http://carousels.org/census/census-INAC.html|publisher=National Carousel Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130923061145/http://carousels.org/census/census-INAC.html|archivedate=2013-09-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the restoration of the [[B&amp;B Carousell]] for its 2013 reopening on the [[Riegelmann Boardwalk|Coney Island Boardwalk]], it was discovered that one of the horses is in fact by Marcus Illions.  All of the other horses were executed in the early 1920s by another well-known Coney Island carver, [[Charles Carmel]].  The Illions horse was one of a set of four executed in 1909 to commemorate the centennial of the birth of [[Abraham Lincoln]], and features colorful rhinestones and a relief of Lincoln's profile.  This is the only one of the set that can be ridden by the public today, as the other three are all in private collections.  The most recent prior owner of the B&amp;B had used the Illions horse to replace one of the Carmel horses that an earlier owner had removed from the carousel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Foderaro|first=Lisa W.|title=Summer’s Steeds, Back Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/nyregion/bb-carousell-horses-return-home-to-coney-island.html?smid=pl-share|accessdate=23 September 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Marquis St. Evrémonde''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]''.

==Overview==
The Marquis or [[Monseigneur]] St. Evrémonde appears (in life) for only three chapters in Book the Second, symbolizing the pitiless, arrogant, French aristocracy.  About 60 years old, with a face like a mask, he is [[Charles Darnay]]'s uncle and twin brother of Charles Darnay's father (now deceased).

===Marquis in Paris===
While still handsome, fashionable, and exquisitely poised, the Marquis St. Evrémonde is out of favor at the royal court for reasons that are not specified.  In "Monseigneur in Town", the Marquis is greeted without warmth by "Monseigneur" (a great lord and senior courtier) at the latter's Parisian reception.  Snubbed, he waits until all Monseigneur's sycophants and hangers-on file out, then murmurs a curse sending Monseigneur to the Devil.  (Note that the curse is uttered in a mirrored salon, possibly suggesting that it rebounds on the speaker.) The Marquis St. Evrémonde's carriage heads for his country chateau through the streets of Paris, at the break-neck pace favored by the nobility.  Although most pedestrians scatter in terror, his carriage runs over a little child; being one of Gaspard's.  The Marquis shows no remorse at the sight of the crushed body — inquiring whether his horses are alright — and, "with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had paid for it",&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDickens2003|Dickens 2003]], (Book 2, Chapter 7).&lt;/ref&gt; throws a gold coin to the distraught father. The Defarges appear—Ernest Defarge to comfort the grieving Gaspard; Madame Defarge to stand erect, stare at the Marquis boldly in the face and knit his Fate. The remainder of the crowd watches in cowed silence but an unknown hand throws the coin back into the carriage. Before driving on, the Marquis responds with cold contempt that he would willingly ride over any of "you dogs" and exterminate them. This scene foreshadows the oncoming revolution in France.

===Marquis at his estate===
The Marquis St. Evrémonde appears in the two following chapters "Monseigneur in the Country" (when he is told by a road worker that a dust-covered figure was hanging on to the bottom of his carriage) and "the "Gorgon's Head" (dining with his nephew, Charles Darnay). Dickens uses his account of the journey of the indifferent Marquis through the countryside surrounding his chateau to graphically describe the poverty and desperation of the peasantry.

During the dinner between uncle and nephew, Charles Darnay apologizes for being detained in London.  He alludes to his danger there (his recent treason trial) wondering aloud if his uncle did not in fact orchestrate the accusations brought against him.  Charles further believes that if the Marquis were still in the French Court's good graces, he would obtain a ''[[lettre de cachet]]'' and have his nephew imprisoned in France.  His uncle confesses that for the honor of the family, he '"would do exactly that'".

The dinner conversation between uncle and nephew reveals their diametrically opposed view of the rural peasantry.  St. Evrémonde the elder considers it a divine duty to subjugate "the Vulgar", ("Repression is the only lasting philosophy…"). He regrets that recent reforms have placed some restraints on the formerly absolute powers of his class to abuse their inferiors; recalling that at an earlier date he had one peasant [[poniard|poniarded]] in his very bedroom for "professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter".  Charles Darnay, by contrast, hopes to honor his mother’s dying wish by ameliorating the wrongs the family has caused.  When his uncle laughs at this, Charles renounces his rights to the Evrémonde title and lands, in favor of a new life in London.  His uncle, slyly, already knows that this "new life" includes an emigree doctor and his daughter.

They retire for the night.

===Death of the Marquis and aftermath===
At the conclusion of Chapter 9, the Marquis is found stabbed to death in his bed. “The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added the one stone face waiting for two hundred years." (Chapter 9). All of his property is inherited by Darnay, who remains in London but instructs an agent to redress grievances as far as possible in the growing confusion of the pending revolution.

A year later Gaspard, assassin of the Marquis and father of the child ridden down by his carriage, is captured and executed, his body left hanging above the village water fountain. Subsequently the Evrémonde chateau is burned to the ground at night by "Jacques" revolutionaries while the abused villagers watch in grim silence and the officers of a neighboring royal garrison stand helpless because they know that their troops will probably no longer obey their orders.

Only later in the novel, during the trial of Charles Darnay, is the secret of the Marquis and his brother exposed: [[Alexandre Manette]]'s diary from the Bastille details how in 1767 the Evrémonde brothers {the younger initially helped by the elder} had abducted and abused a pregnant peasant wife causing her death, fatally wounded her brother who tried to protect her and had brought about the deaths of both the girl's husband and father as well. Manette tries to alert the authorities to the Evrémonde crimes but his letter is passed on to the aristocratic brothers. This was the reason he was imprisoned in the Bastille; likewise this was the inspiration of a lifelong hatred of the Evrémondes by the last member of the wronged girl's family-her sister [[Madame Defarge]] who married Manette's servant [[Ernest Defarge]].

===Names===
The Marquis St. Evrémonde is referred to as "Monseigneur" and "Monsieur." These three different titles all refer to the same person: people who are below the Marquis in rank refer to him as "Monseigneur" or "Monsieur," while people of equal rank refer to him as the "Marquis."

Note also that the patronym "Evrémonde", suggests an Anglo-French conglomerate, ("every" plus "tout le monde").  Phonetically, it sounds like “Everyman.”
And, when the phrases "evre" and "monde" are separately translated from French into English, they mean fever and world, making the name "Feverworld".

The note on the knife in the Marquis chest is signed "Jacques"; a common nickname used by the aristocracy for the peasant was "[[Jacquerie|Jacques Goodman]]".

==Cinematic and Theatrical Portrayals==
In the 2008 [[Broadway musical]] adaptation of '[[A Tale of Two Cities (musical)|A Tale of Two Cities]],' the Marquis St. Evrémonde is played by [[Les Minski]], while on film he has been played by such actors as [[Basil Rathbone]], [[Christopher Lee]], and [[Max Adrian]]. In 2003, the Rathbone portrayal of St. Evrémonde was nominated for [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains]] as one of the Top 50 Villains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/handv400.pdf AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains Nominees]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rachel Clinton''' (née Haffield; c. 1629 – 1694/95), born in [[Sudbury, Suffolk]], [[England]] to Richard and Martha Haffield, was a survivor of the [[Salem witch trials]].

==Early years==
In the spring of 1635 the Haffield family emigrated to [[New England]] and sailed upon a ship named ''The Planter''.&lt;ref name=name&gt;{{Citation|first=John|last=Putnam Demos|title=Entertaining Satan: witchcraft and the culture of early New England|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=1983|isbn=978-0-19-503378-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rachel was one of five daughters and her mother had been a maid-servant who was later deemed to be mentally insane. Rachel grew up in an affluent household although the Haffield family fortune was ever dwindling.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

In 1639 Rachel's father died and her mother rented out sections of their property to tenants as well as earning an income from [[spinning (textiles)]]. Her father's will stipulated that his estate be divided evenly among his wife and five daughters. The will triggered years of quarrels and bitterness in the family, particularly in regard to the children of his first marriage. Rachel therefore passed her later childhood years in the absence of an older male in the family as she had no brothers, an atypical situation for the era. The mental condition of her mother continued to deteriorate in the ensuing years and she was declared "[[non compos mentis]]" in 1666 by local magistrates.&lt;ref name=name/&gt;

==Marriage==
{{moresources|section|date=April 2016}}
Rachel, at age 36, married Lawrence Clinton, who was some fourteen years her junior.&lt;ref name=name/&gt; Legal proceedings during this entire period were still underway regarding the estate of her late father and Rachel became an unfortunate loser. It was never made clear whether she ever received monies from her rightful inheritance and solicitation was acrimonious to the extent that she descended into destitution having fallen out of favour with her husband.

In 1671 Rachel accused her husband of not providing her with regular maintenance and he was sentenced to [[prison]] until he "hath paid her 40 [[shillings]] for times past". Rachel herself was ordered "to entertain him as her husband when he comes to her". Further legal problems presented themselves when in September 1676 the court convicted Mary Greeley, a maidservant, of "committing [[fornication]] with Lawrence Clinton".&lt;ref name=name/&gt;

Soon after, Rachel petitioned for [[divorce]] but was herself imprisoned for pursuing an extra-marital affair with a man called John Ford. Both were incarcerated on "suspicion of uncleanliness and other evil practises".&lt;ref name=name/&gt; The two were bound to maintain 'good behaviour' and the relationship with Ford ended. She renewed her efforts to obtain a divorce from Lawrence Clinton, who married again although not divorced from Rachel, sired children, and continued to come before the courts on minor charges of fraud.

==Allegations==
{{moresources|section|date=April 2016}}
From this point on Rachel was forced to beg for money to support herself and it is at this stage in her life that allegations of witchcraft begin to appear. A variety of [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]] residents were called to give sworn depositions against her in 1692. Allegations were made by a Mary Fuller that Rachel had caused the death of a neighbour simply by passing her by. Another witness, Thomas Boreman, described an incident in the Ipswich meeting-house where "Some women of worth and quality" had accused Rachel of "hunching them with her elbow".&lt;ref name=name/&gt; Boreman further alluded that Rachel was able to [[shape-shift]] into creatures including a dog and a turtle.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

William Baker, a third deponent, attributed the loss of a quantity of beer to Rachel by [[supernatural]] means. These are a few examples of dozens of allegations made against Rachel which established her infamy as a practicant of witchcraft. She was alleged to have passed people in the street and yelled "hellhound"&lt;ref name=name/&gt; and "whoremasterly rogue"&lt;ref name=name/&gt; at them.

==Last Years and Death==
{{moresources|section|date=April 2016}}
Rachel's vulnerabilities made her a target for predators of the day, including her husband Lawrence, who made use of the Salem Witch Trials to exploit and vilify impoverished women who had fallen through the social classes and from grace when entering the arena of poverty.

Rachel Clinton died destitute in late 1694 or during the first week of January 1695 at [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich, Essex County, Massachusetts]]. Although the date of her death does not appear in formal records, on January 7, 1695 the administration of her estate &lt;!-- what estate, if she was penniless?? --&gt; was granted to a Ruth White {{Who|date=April 2016}} of [[Wenham, Massachusetts|Wenham]].&lt;ref name=name/&gt;

'''Rani Sati''', also identified as '''Narayani Devi''' and referred to as '''Dadiji''' (grandmother), is said to be a [[Rajasthan]]i woman who lived sometime between the 13th and the 17th century and committed [[sati (practice)|sati]] (self-immolation) on her husband's death. Various temples in Rajasthan and elsewhere are devoted to her worship and to commemorate her act.

==Legends==
The accounts of Rani Sati's life and the events leading to her death vary widely. Her death has been dated to 1295 or 1595 in some re-tellings,&lt;ref name=Hardgrove&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardgrove|first=Anne|title=Sati worship and Marwari public identity in India|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|date=August 1999|volume=58|pages=723–752|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=FA42FA7AA7132B7D3136A743A30770AC.journals?fromPage=online&amp;aid=6747188|doi=10.2307/2659117}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others place her in the 14th century,&lt;ref name=Sen&gt;{{cite book|last=Sen|first=Mala|title=Death by Fire: Sati, Dowry Death, and Female Infanticide in Modern India|year=2002|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813531021|pages=42–51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aG7nntWmhpMC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even the 17th century.&lt;ref name = Courtright/&gt; One such legend, recounted by Sakuntala Narsimhan, says:&lt;ref name=Narasimhan&gt;{{cite book|last=Narasimhan|first=Sakuntala|title=Sati - Widow Burning in India|year=1992|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780385423175|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Rani] was a seventeen-year-old girl of the [[Bania (caste)|Bania]] caste. The legend is that the nawab coveted the white mare that her betrothed rode on, and in the confrontation that ensued, [Rani's husband] Tandhan Das was killed, leaving his faithful servant as the only survivor apart from Dadi Narayani Devi, and her mare. When the servant asked her whether he should take her back to her father's or to her father-in-law's, she is said to have replied that she would become a sati and wherever the horse stopped while carrying the ashes of the couple, a temple to their memory should be raised.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Another version of the legend, as related by Anne Hardgrove, says:&lt;ref name = Hardgrove/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
..., on one day about six hundred years ago a fourteen-year-old Hindu bride named Narayani Devi was coming home for the first time with her husband (of the Jalan lineage) just after their marriage. Her husband worked as a merchant in Jhunjhunu. Muslim invaders suddenly attacked her husband and his companions, brutally killing them. Only Narayani Devi and (in some versions) a loyal Muslim servant named "Rana" survived the attack. According to the story, Narayani Devi then bravely burned herself to death by spontaneously bursting into flames to avoid being captured and kidnapped by these invaders.   
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other accounts ascribe the killing of her husband to a band of dacoits, and say that Rani died by the same hand in trying to defend her honour.&lt;ref name=Sen/&gt; Yet other versions regard Rani as the first of thirteen widows in her Jalan family to commit sati.&lt;ref name = Hardgrove/&gt;

==Worship and temples==
Several temples in India, especially in the North Western state of Rajasthan, are devoted to Rani Sati and her act of sati. There are numerous other Sati temples in the region including Narayani Sati in [[Alwar]], Dholan Sati in [[Raipur]] and [[Rani Bhatiyani]] in [[Jasol]]. Sati worship had been common in these regions, [[Banarasidas]] in his Ardhakathanaka (1643), mentions his  family visiting the sati shrine associated with his clan. Though veneration of Rani Sati and patronage of these temples cut across caste, regional and even religious lines,&lt;ref name = Thomas&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinberger-Thomas|first=Catherine|title=Ashes of Immortality: Widow-Burning in India|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=1999|isbn=9780226885698}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are particularly prevalent amongst the merchant [[Marwari people|Marwari]] community, and its [[Agrawal]] sub-caste.&lt;ref name = Courtright&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtright|first=Paul B|title=Sati, the Blessing and the Curse: The Burning of Wives in India|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195360226|editor=Hawley, John Stratton|chapter=The iconographies of Sati}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of those communities have funded the construction of Rani Sati temples, and transformed her status from a ''[[kuldevi]]'' (family deity) to a Goddess subject to public worship.&lt;ref name=Vaid&gt;{{cite journal| last=Vaid|first=Sudesh|author2=Sangari, Kumkum | title=Institutions, Beliefs, Ideologies: Widow immolation in contemporary Rajasthan|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=27 April 1991|pages=2–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent of these shrines is the [[Rani Sati Temple]] in the [[Shekhavati]] region of Rajasthan, administered and attracting a large following from [[Kolkata]]. The temple was inaugurated in 1912, and started off as a set of simple memorial mounds. Construction of a larger complex began in 1917, financed by donations from the  Jalan clan of the Agarwal community, and was completed in 1936.&lt;ref name = Hardgrove/&gt; As of today, the temple is a monumental complex with a multi-storey structure, a main hall made of marble, and dual courtyards surrounded by rooms that can house up to 300 pilgrims. Rani Sati herself is represented by a [[trident]], and considered a manifestation of the Goddess [[Shakti]]. In the sanctum, there is a depiction of Rani Sati surrounded by [[Ganesha]], [[Shiva]] and [[Durga]], while a wall frieze recounts the events leading to her husband's death, her self-immolation, and the subsequent construction of the temple itself. The temple is said to have an annual income of [[Indian rupee|Rupee]]s twenty [[lakh]]s and assets of Rupees eighty lakhs. The temple trustees also organize a well-attended annual fair to celebrate Rani Sati.&lt;ref name = Sen/&gt;&lt;ref name = Thomas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown|first=Lindsay|title=Rajasthan, Delhi &amp; Agra|year=2008|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=9781741046908|author2=Thomas, Amelia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zz0_zXPb68kC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are other Sati shrines belonging to other satis in the same family in the compound. There are other Sati temples in Jhunjhunu belonging to other communities.

A Rajasthani movie ''Laj Rakho Rani Sati'' was released in 1973.

Perhaps the oldest existing Rani Sati temple outside Jhunjhunu dates to 1837 and is located at [[Kankurgachi]] in Kolkata.  Hundreds of other Rani Sati temples are located in Bombay, Delhi, Varanasi, Kolkata, Hyderabad and other places in India, as well as in Rangoon, Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.&lt;ref name=Courtright/&gt;&lt;ref name = Thomas/&gt; On 1 December 1980, a public procession taken out by Rani Sati devotees in New Delhi to celebrate the construction of a new Rani Sati temple in the city was protested against by feminists and those opposed to the practice of sati. This led to discussions in both houses of the [[Parliament of India|Indian Parliament]] over promotion of the practice of sati, and [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Indira Gandhi]] halted construction of the new temple, calling ''satipuja'' (worship of ''sati''s) a "barbaric medieval, and illegal" practice.&lt;ref name = Hardgrove/&gt;

In 1996, many of Rani Sati devotees celebrated the 400th anniversary of her supposed birthday on 4 December, including at a large public [[yagna]] near the temple at Jhunjhunu (the date was possibly picked in tacit protest of the formal banning of sati in [[Bengal Presidency]] by Lord [[Lord William Bentinck]] on 4 December 1829.)&lt;ref name = Hardgrove/&gt;

On 20 November 2015 its been marked as 734 Birthday of Dadi Rani Sati

==Roop Kanwar controversy==
{{main|Roop Kanwar}}
The practice of worshiping ''sati''s has often been subject of controversy in India, and the Rani Sati Temple at Jhunjhunu came under particularly harsh spot-light when a 19-year widow [[Roop Kanwar]] (who was reported to be a devotee of Rani Sati&lt;ref name=Rajeswari&gt;{{cite book| last=Rajeswari|first=Sunder Rajan|title=Real and Imagined Women: Gender, Culture and Postcolonialism| year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203359662|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_AEAZp10lYQC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;) committed sati in 1987 in the nearby town of [[Deorala]].&lt;ref name = Sen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; Following Kanwar's immolation, the Indian government issued an order proscribing the 'glorification of Sati', and tried banning the annual fair at Jhunjhunu. The Calcutta High Court lifted the ban, and on appeal, the [[Supreme Court of India]] modified it to allow worship of Rani Sati within the temple while forbidding the celebration of her sati through the ''chunari'' ceremonies in which brides seek the Goddess's blessings by offering her their bridal veils. The court also disallowed the fair, which is held on the temple's outer grounds. However the controversy and court decisions, brought even greater attention to the town of Deorala and the Rani Sati temple, and attracted thousands of pilgrims to the temple and the fair that year.&lt;ref name = Sen/&gt; Elsewhere in India, while many Rani Sati temples halted their public celebrations soon after Roop Kanwar's death, their activities resumed within a few years.&lt;ref name = Hardgrove/&gt;

'''Rash Behari Bose''' ({{audio|Rasbihar Bose.ogg|pronunciation}}; {{lang-bn|রাসবিহারী বসু}} ''Rashbihari Boshu''; 25 May 1886{{spaced en dash}}21 January 1945) was an Indian revolutionary leader against the [[British Raj]] and was one of the key organisers of the [[Ghadar Mutiny]] and later the [[Indian National Army]]. He was born in Subaldaha village of Purba Bardhaman district in West Bengal.

== Early life ==
Rash Behari Bose was born in village Subaldaha, Purba Bardhaman district, in West Bengal. His father's name was Binod Behari Bose. Bhubaneswari Devi was his mother. Tinkori Dasi was Rashbehari Bose's foster mother. The major part of the childhood of Rashbehari Bose and Sushila Sarkar was spent in the village Subaldaha. They lived in this village at the house of madam Bidhumukhi. Bidhumukhi was a widow from her early life. Bidhumukhi was the sister in law of Kalicharan Bose.  His early education was completed under the supervision of his grandfather Kalicharan Bose at village Pathsala  (Presently Subaldaha     
Rashbehari Bose F.P School) at his birthplace. Rash Behari Bose got an education of Lathi Khela in his child at Subaldaha. He got inspiration of revolutionary movement hearing stories from his grandfather at his birthplace Subaldaha. He was the cynosure of all villagers. His nickname was Rasu. He was stubborn and the villagers loved him very much. It is heard from villagers that he was at Subaldaha till he was 12 or 14 years old. His father, Binod Behari Bose, was stationed in Hooghly district. Bose studied in Dupleix College with his friend [[Shrish Chandra Ghosh]].  The principal Charu Chandra Roy inspired them into revolutionary politics. Later he joined "Morton school" in Kolkata. Bose later earned degrees in the medical sciences as well as in Engineering from France and Germany.

==Revolutionary activities==
{{Main|Delhi conspiracy case|Gadar Conspiracy}}
He was interested in revolutionary activities from early on in his life, he left Bengal to shun the [[Alipore bomb case]] trials of (1908). At [[Dehradun]] he worked as a head clerk at the [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]]. There, through [[Amarendra Chatterjee]] of the [[Jugantar]] led by [[Jatin Mukherjee]] (Bagha Jatin), he secretly got involved with the revolutionaries of [[Bengal]] and he came across eminent revolutionary members of the [[Arya Samaj]] in the United Provinces (currently [[Uttar Pradesh]]) and the [[Punjab region|Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;''Two Great Indian Revolutionaries: Rash Behari Bose and Jyotindra Nath Mukherjee'' by Uma Mukherjee, 1966, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Originally Rash Behari Bose stay few years in Hooghly district, West Bengal.
[[File: An assassination attempt on Lord Charles Hardinge.jpg|thumb|left|1912 assassination attempt on Lord Hardinge]]
Following the attempt [[Delhi-Lahore Conspiracy|to assassinate Lord Hardinge]], Rash Behari was forced to go into hiding. The attempt was made on 23 December 1912 in Delhi when [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Lord Hardinge]] was in a ceremonial procession transferring the capital from Calcutta to New Delhi. He was attacked near the Red Fort by [[Basanta Kumar Biswas]] a disciple of Amrendar Chattarjee, but missed the target and failed. The bomb was made by [[Manindra Nath Nayak]]. Bose was hunted by the colonial police due to his active participation in the failed assassination attempt (actually Bose's aim was to prove to the world that Indians do not accept the subjection of his country to foreign rule by consent, but by force of military power, which was successful. Otherwise, he had no personal enmity with Lord Hardinge) directed at the [[Governor General]] and [[Viceroy]] Lord [[Charles Hardinge]] in [[Delhi]]. He returned to Dehra Dun by the night train and joined the office the next day as though nothing had happened. Further, he organized a meeting of loyal citizens of Dehradun to condemn the dastardly attack on the Viceroy.

Lord Hardinge, in his ''My Indian Years'', described the whole incident in an interesting way. During the flood relief work in Bengal in 1913, he came in contact with [[Jatin Mukherjee]] in whom he "discovered a real leader of men," who "added a new impulse" to Rash Behari's failing zeal.&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit.'', p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Thus during [[World War I]] he became extensively involved as one of the leading figures of the [[Gadar Conspiracy|Gadar Revolution]] that attempted to trigger a mutiny in India in February 1915. Trusted and tried Ghadrites were sent to several cantonments to infiltrate into the army. The idea of the [[Gadar Conspiracy|Gadar]] leaders was that with the war raging in Europe most of the soldiers had gone out of India and the rest could be easily won over. The revolution failed and most of the revolutionaries were arrested. But Rash Behari managed to escape British intelligence and reached Japan in 1915.

==Indian National Army==
[[File:Toyama Mitsuru honors Rash Behari Bose.jpg|thumb|300px|A dinner party given to Bose in his honour by his close Japanese friends, including [[Mitsuru Tōyama]], a right-wing nationalist and [[Pan-Asianism]] leader (centre, behind the table), and [[Tsuyoshi Inukai]], future Japanese prime minister (to the right of Tōyama). Behind Tōyama is Bose. 1915.]]
Bose fled to Japan in 1915, under the alias of Priyanath Tagore, a relative of Rabindranath Tagore. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.anandabazar.com/supplementary/rabibashoriyo/remembering-rash-behari-bose-and-his-wife-toshiko-bose-in-their-marriage-anniversary-1.828592|title=বাংলা থেকে রান্না-শাড়ি পরা, জাপানি বউকে শিখিয়েছিলেন রাসবিহারী বসু|last=বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়|first=পারিজাত|work=anandabazar.com|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Bose found shelter with various [[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asian]] groups. From 1915–1918, he changed residences and identities numerous times, as the British kept pressing the Japanese government for his extradition. He married the daughter of [[Aizō Sōma]] and [[Kokkō Sōma]], the owners of Nakamuraya bakery in Tokyo and noted Pan-Asian supporters in 1918, and became a Japanese citizen in 1923, living as a journalist and writer. It is also significant that he was instrumental in introducing Indian-style curry in Japan. Though more expensive than the usual "British-style" curry, it became quite popular, with Rash Bihari becoming known as "Bose of Nakamuraya".

Bose along with [[A M Nair]] was instrumental in persuading the Japanese authorities to stand by the Indian nationalists and ultimately to officially actively support the Indian independence struggle abroad. Bose convened a conference [[Tokyo Conference|in Tokyo]] on 28–30 March 1942, which decided to establish the ''[[Indian Independence League]]''. At the conference, he moved a motion to raise an army for Indian independence. He convened the second conference of the League [[Bangkok Conference|at Bangkok]] on 22 June 1942. It was at this conference that a resolution was adopted to invite [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] to join the League and take its command as its president.

The Indian prisoners of war captured by the Japanese in the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya, North Borneo, and Sarawak|Malaya]] and [[Burma]] fronts were encouraged to join the Indian Independence League and become the soldiers of the [[Indian National Army]] (INA), formed on 1 September 1942 as the military wing of Bose's Indian National League. He selected the flag for the [[Azad Hind]] movement and handed over the flag to [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. But although he handed over the power, his organizational structure remained, and it was on the organizational spadework of Rash Behari Bose that Subhas Chandra Bose later built the Indian National Army (also called 'Azad Hind Fauj'). Prior to his death caused by tuberculosis, the Japanese Government honored him with the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] (2nd grade).

== Personal life ==
Bose met Toshiko Soma when he was hiding at her house in [[Shinjuku|Shinjuku City]]. She was the daughter of [[Aizō Sōma]] and [[Kokkō Sōma]], the owners of Nakamuraya bakery([[:ja:中村屋]]) in Tokyo and noted Pan-Asian supporters in 1918. At that time, Bose was a fugitive with the British searching for him. Their initial contact was during those intense moments of hiding though without any interactions. In 1916, when Bose was a fugitive no more, he invited the Soma family to his house as a gesture of gratitude. That was the first instance of their interaction in a social context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.anandabazar.com/supplementary/rabibashoriyo/remembering-rash-behari-bose-and-his-wife-toshiko-bose-in-their-marriage-anniversary-1.828592|title=বাংলা থেকে রান্না-শাড়ি পরা, জাপানি বউকে শিখিয়েছিলেন রাসবিহারী বসু|last=বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়|first=পারিজাত|work=anandabazar.com|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Bose stuck out like a sore thumb in Japan. People would consider them with suspicion. [[Tōyama Mitsuru|Mitsuru Toyama]], as a solution propsed to the Soma's a marriage between Toshiko and Rashbehari. He thought that marriage with a Japanese citizen would make it easy for Bose to apply for citizenship. Despite their initial reservations, the Soma's agreed to the match. When, they asked for Toshiko's consent,  she took three weeks to decide. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.anandabazar.com/supplementary/rabibashoriyo/remembering-rash-behari-bose-and-his-wife-toshiko-bose-in-their-marriage-anniversary-1.828592|title=বাংলা থেকে রান্না-শাড়ি পরা, জাপানি বউকে শিখিয়েছিলেন রাসবিহারী বসু|last=বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়|first=পারিজাত|work=anandabazar.com|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They had a happy marriage. Bose taught Toshiko Bengali and how to wear a sari.

Bose got Japanese citizenship in 1923. Toshiko's health declined soon after and it claimed her life in 1924.

Their marriage lasted for eight years. After her death, he never remarried. They were buried together after Bose's death.

They had two children together. Masahide Bose (Bharatchandra) was born in 1920. He died in WWII aged only 24. Their daughter Tetsuko was born in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.anandabazar.com/supplementary/rabibashoriyo/remembering-rash-behari-bose-and-his-wife-toshiko-bose-in-their-marriage-anniversary-1.828592|title=বাংলা থেকে রান্না-শাড়ি পরা, জাপানি বউকে শিখিয়েছিলেন রাসবিহারী বসু|last=বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়|first=পারিজাত|work=anandabazar.com|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ray Buttigieg''' (born May 1, 1955 in [[Gozo]], [[Malta]]) is a poet and musician.

He attended [[Qala, Malta|Qala]] primary school, then the Lyceum in Victoria, Gozo. He then moved to the United States and continued his studies in New York, where he settled permanently. By the age of 20 he had several poems published in anthologies in London and New York City.

==History==

===Writing===
Best known for ''Pastorale'' (1978), ''Poeticus I &amp; II'' (1986) and (1992), and the very first book he ever wrote in his late teens ''Wizard's Spider Mystic Glider'' (1989) which are written in a [[classicism|classical]] style; he received criticism when he later introduced a more modern style in his experiments and improvisational poetry. In the last few years he returned to his earlier style in works like ''The Wisdom of Stones'' (2002), ''Remnants from the Book of Time'' (2002), and ''The Procession'' (1999). Although for the last 25 years Buttigieg has been writing only in English and very little in his native [[Maltese language|Maltese]], his subject matter still includes a great deal of influence from his native Malta.

===Music===
Ray Buttigieg since the age of ten became extremely interested in music when he started to sing [[Latin]] hymns on the gallery of the grand pipe organ at St Joseph's church. He was also attracted to pieces of metal of various sizes, weights and alloys as well as short wave radios where he thought the combination of these found instruments are uniquely musical that could be used as effects. He later learned the guitar and started to write songs for his first [[Rock and Roll|rock]] improvisational band.

===With Cykx===
Buttigieg started his professional musical career in New York and Philadelphia where he fronted a six piece [[glam/rock]] band [[Cykx]] where his catchy tunes mixed with his lyrical poetry produced two top ten pop hits in the mid-seventies. At the same time synthesizers and [[computers]] and several electronic music experiments on tape were becoming more interesting to Ray Buttigieg than bandmates who could never agree on anything. Soon the band was defunct and a new project band started. '''Ray Buttigieg/Cykx''', Cykx being the computer that replaced the members of the band. The pop or [[rock and roll|rock]] compositions now became explorations and experiments in sound. ''[[Compucircuit 0.008 m/s]]'' (1981), ''[[Mechanism of Thought]]'' (1984) were both very ground breaking albums.

Buttigieg believed that electronic synthesisers was a third 'high' in music, the first and second being acoustic and electric instruments.

===Solo Work===
Buttigieg embarked on a solo career ever since he set eyes on his first keyboards, a [[Mellotron]]. He was involved in multiple projects at the same time while being involved in solo major works and other series concepts like ''Earth noise'' and ''Sound Science Series'' in the 70's and ''[[The Symphonic Poems]]'', ''Music for '' and ''Diary of an Earthling'' series in the 80's. Film and Video work were also becoming a very interesting avenue to combine visuals, poetry and as the music soundtrack that would define the visuals all done under the same roof. He continued his career by producing some influential and lush albums like ''Sound of Transformation – Symphonic Poem No.1'' (1982), ''Quantum Mechanics'' (1985), ''Music for Movies'' (1986), ''Codes'' (1987) and ''Musical Instincts of Nature''.

==Producing records and collaborating==
Since the very beginning of his career in the mid-70's, Buttigieg has been sought after for creative guidance, collaborating, producing and as the idea man. His string of credits include in Rebellion, Process and After Thought in the 80's, and in the 90's co-wrote songs and produced bands like Novi Mystici, Prosper Falls, Selfish like Magnets and Noise Button. In the last few years of the new millennium Buttigieg has written songs for other artists in the genres of [[popular music/pop song]], [[Gothic rock|gothic]] format and has gone aggressively into everything electronic whether it is [[electronica]], [[Ambient music|ambient]], [[new age]] or [[Electronic music|electronic]] producing and collaborating with bands like [[FTSG]], [[Dyr3]], [[System 6]], [[Desire becomes Being]] and [[Circa 2000 AD]] for [[Cykxincorp]] and [[Standing Stone Recording Company]] record labels part of [[Cykxincorp Group of Companies]].

'''Raymond "Ray" Stantz''', [[PhD]] is a [[fictional character]] from the [[Ghostbusters (franchise)|''Ghostbusters'' franchise]]. He appears in the films ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984), ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' (1989), ''[[Casper (film)|Casper]]'' (1995, as a cameo), the [[Animation|animated]] [[television series]] ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' and ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]'', and the [[video game]]s [[Beeline (software company)|Beeline's ''Ghostbusters'']] and ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]''. He was portrayed by [[Dan Aykroyd]] in both live action films, and voiced by [[Frank Welker]] in the animated series. He is a member of the Ghostbusters and one of the three doctors of [[parapsychology]], along with Dr. [[Peter Venkman]] and Dr. [[Egon Spengler]]. [[Dan Aykroyd]] has a [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]'' (2016) as "Cabbie".

==Character==
Ray is an expert on paranormal history and [[metallurgy]]. He is characterized by his almost childlike enthusiasm towards his work, and his forthright acceptance of [[paranormal]] activity. As a result, Peter once during the movie referred to him as "the heart of the Ghostbusters". Ray has extensive knowledge of the [[Bible]] (to the point of even quoting a specific book and chapter — "I remember Revelation 7:12"—about the end of the world, though the passage he quotes is actually Revelation 6:12), but is an [[agnostic]], commenting when asked if he believes in God, "Never met Him". As revealed in ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'', Ray attended a seminary at some stage in his life. He is known for his wordy and overly technical explanations of scientific and paranormal phenomena. Ray, along with Egon, is responsible for pioneering the Ghostbusters' theories and designing and building the equipment used for catching and containing [[ghosts]]. Ray Stantz appeared in the 1995 film ''[[Casper (film)|Casper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |date=1995-05-26 |title=Casper (PG) |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950526/REVIEWS/505260301/1023

==Appearances==

===Film===

====''Ghostbusters'' (1984)====
Before being kicked out of the University, Ray was devoting a lot of his workday to interviewing people who had some sort of encounter with the paranormal. After the entanglement with the library ghost, Ray was more motivated to continue on with that type of work. When the guys were let go by Dean Yager, he was initially crushed, primarily concerned with his academic integrity, financial stability, etc. Ray had briefly worked in the private sector beforehand, and knew it wasn't conductive to his line of work, as they expected notable results.

After talking with Peter Venkman and Egon Spengler, they all decided to try hunting ghosts full-time. Ray even mortgaged the house he was born in to provide the starting capital to get the company started and lease the firehouse. In addition, he rummaged through used car lots to find a suitable vehicle and repair it to make the Ecto-1.

Dr. Stantz also has the distinction of being the first Ghostbuster to meet Slimer. Unlike his other continuity, however Ray dropped his cigarette in fear. He then went proton blasting, after his call for assistance was unheard by Venkman.

Ray accidentally chose the form of Gozer's appearance because of his childhood times at Camp Waconda. Despite his initial attempt at negotiations, he wound up fighting Gozer with his Proton Pack. After reversing the particle flow to force Gozer back into his realm, Ray was concerned about the other guys' welfare after the explosion, and then celebrated with them all afterward. Although this was short-lived by the, "ungrateful, yuppie larvae!" representing the city, county and state of New York.

====''Ghostbusters II'' (1989)====
{{main article|Ghostbusters II}}
In the second film, following the decline of the Ghostbusters' business, he and Winston were entertainers for parties. When he was not doing that, he was running his bookstore, Ray's Occult Books. However, when Dana Barrett comes to Egon and later Ray, it becomes clear that something supernatural was once again happening underneath [[New York City]].

Ray and Egon experiment with the Psychomagnotheric Slime they find and eventually discover a way to not only positively charge the slime, but utilize it to animate the Statue of Liberty in their final assault on Vigo the Carpathian. Ray also briefly becomes the host for Vigo himself, but a liberal dousing of the positively charged mood slime quickly cures him of that.

====''Casper'' (1995)====
{{main article|Casper (film)}}
[[Dan Aykroyd]] has a [[cameo appearance]] as Stantz in ''[[Casper (film)|Casper]]''. When Carrigan and Dibs are attempting to evict the [[Ghostly Trio]] from the McFadden Manor, before contacting Dr. James Harvey, they contact Ray Stantz of the Ghostbusters. After he fails to capture the Ghostly Trio, he runs out of the manor in fear, and says to Carrigan and Dibs:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''Who you gonna call? Someone else.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Television===

====''The Real Ghostbusters''====
{{main article|The Real Ghostbusters}}
Ray has an extended family (which has different nationalities ranging from Swiss to Scottish to Russian), including his Aunt Lois (who appears in the episode, "The Spirit of Aunt Lois"), and Uncle Andrew MacMillan of [[Dunkeld]], Scotland (who is mentioned as being deceased in "Bustman's Holiday").

Ray was born in the Bronx in 1959, according to the episodes ''Citizen Ghost'', and "It's About Time", then later moved to [[Morrisville, New York|Morrisville]], which appears in ''Look Homeward Ray''. The latter episode also reveals that Ray's childhood crush was a brunette named Elaine.

During the show's run he was the closest member of the team to being a pilot, having won a free flying lesson in 1976, as mentioned in ''You Can't Take It With You''.

Ray's surname was misspelled in the series as '''Stanz''', in much the same way as [[Winston Zeddemore]]'s surname was misspelled '''Zeddmore'''.

Ray is the only Ghostbuster to wear the original beige jumpsuit uniform in both the animated series and the films, while the other Ghostbusters wore color coded jumpsuits in the animated series - brown for Venkman, light blue for Winston and gray-blue for Egon (presumably to help differentiate them better).

====''Extreme Ghostbusters''====
{{main article|Extreme Ghostbusters}}
Ray appears only in the two-part series finale of ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]''. After the closing down of the Ghostbusters Ray got a job at a major university. After a "minor mishap," followed by a large explosion, he has a job at Perpetual Motors, a used car company.

===Video games===

====''Ghostbusters: The Video Game''====
{{main article|Ghostbusters: The Video Game}}
A likeness of Aykroyd, circa 1991 (the year in which the game takes place) appears in the ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'', that was released on June 16, 2009. Aykroyd also reprised his role for the game by voicing him.&lt;ref name="IGN-PS3-Review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller |first=Greg |url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/992/992635p1.html |title=IGN: Ghostbusters: The Video Game Review |publisher=[[IGN]]|date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the game, Stantz is eager to expand his knowledge in regards to researching the paranormal. More than once he asks the Rookie to collect samples and take readings for later research. Ray is also the most vocally supportive of the Rookie.

It is mentioned that the mortgage for the Ghostbusters Headquarters is in his name. His selection for the [[Stay Puft Marshmallow Man]]'s form of Gozer's "Destructor Form" was mentioned in a quote "It wasn't me this time, I swear it!" when the Ghostbusters see that the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man is once again terrorizing New York. Ray is the most visibly shaken to see the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man again.

Ray is shown to possess skill in operating nautical vessels (i.e.: migrant sponge observation, mentioned earlier) as he's the primary navigator on Marine Ecto-8.

====Beeline's ''Ghostbusters''====
Stantz appears in [[Beeline (software company)|Beeline]]'s ''Ghostbusters'' game for [[iOS]]. The game was released on January 24, 2013.

====''Lego Dimensions''====
{{main article|Lego Dimensions}}
Stantz appears in ''Lego Dimensions'', with archival audio of Dan Aykroyd being used to represent his character.

==Federal Procession of 1788==
Platt served as the chairman of the Committee of Arrangements&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt; in organizing New York's [[Federal Procession of 1788]], which celebrated the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt; Contrary to popular opinion, New York had not yet ratified the Constitution by the time of that state's Federal Procession.&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt; Once news that sufficient ratification by the requisite nine states had been achieved upon [[New Hampshire]]'s ratification on June 21, 1788,&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt; officials in New York City planned a celebratory procession for July 22, hoping that by that time, New York would have also ratified the constitution.&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt; Although New York still had not ratified as the planned procession's date approached, Platt determined that, due to the overwhelming public excitement surrounding the constitution's consummation, the celebratory procession could no longer be delayed, saying: "The day having been more than once postponed in the interesting hope that this state, then in its convention, would likewise accede to the Union, the Committee of Arrangements found it impossible any longer to oppose this patriotic ardor of their fellow citizens."&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt;

New York's procession was finally set for July 23, 1788. By that time, Virginia had also acceded to the constitution, bringing the total number of states which had ratified the constitution to ten.&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt; New York's procession was thus organized into ten divisions, being various groups of merchants, tradesmen, and mechanics, to celebrate those states.&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt;

[[File:Sanger's amphitheatre - Evanion collection (1886) - BL.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Poster for an 1886 production of Reece's ''Aladdin and the Forty Thieves'']]
'''Robert Reece''' (2 May 1838 – 8 July 1891) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] comic playwright and librettist active in the [[Victorian era]].  He wrote many successful [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesques]], [[comic opera]]s, farces and adaptations from the French, including the English-language adaptation of the operetta ''[[Les cloches de Corneville]]'', which became the longest-running piece of [[musical theatre]] in history up to that time.  He sometimes collaborated with [[Henry Brougham Farnie]] or others.

==Early life and career==
Reece was born in the island of [[Barbados]], [[West Indies]].  His father, Robert Reece (1808–1874), was a [[barrister]] of the [[Inner Temple]].  Reece matriculated from [[Balliol College]], [[Oxford]] in 1857 and received his B.A. in 1860 and his M.A. in 1864.  He was admitted a student at the Inner Temple in 1860 but was not [[called to the bar]]. For a short time he was a medical student. Between 1861 and 1863, he was an extra clerk in the office of the ecclesiastical commissioners, and from 1864 to 1868 an extra temporary clerk to the emigration commissioners.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Reece, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1860s to the 1880s, Reece wrote comic pieces for the stage with fair success, often adapting three-act European operettas into two-act English-language pieces. He even scored a number of hits, including his adaptation of ''[[Les cloches de Corneville]]'', which ran for over 700 performances in 1878–79, the longest run in the history of [[musical theatre]] up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/th-longr.html List of longest running plays in London and New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reece's first professionally produced effort was the libretto of an operetta, ''Castle Grim'', with music by G. Allen, produced at the [[Royalty Theatre]] in 1865.  Among his subsequent contributions to the same stage were the [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] ''Prometheus'' (1865),&lt;ref&gt;Printed in Lacy's ''Acting Edition of Plays'', vol. lxviii&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Lady of the Lake'' (1866),&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, vol. lxxi&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Whittington Junior and his Sensation Cat'' (1871, starring [[Fred Sullivan]] and [[Henrietta Hodson]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, vol. lxxxix&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote for the Royalty ''Dora's Device'', a comedietta (1871),&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, vol. xc&lt;/ref&gt; ''Little Robin Hood'', a burlesque (1871), revived at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] (1882),&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, vol. xci&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Paquita, or Love in a Trance'', a [[comic opera]] with music by J. A. Mallandine (1871).&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, vol. xciv&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Queen's Theatre]], he produced ''The Stranger, stranger than Ever,'' a burlesque (1868).&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, vol. lxxxii&lt;/ref&gt;  Another burlesque the same year at the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]] was ''Agamemnon and Cassandra''&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1UM5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA542&amp;lpg=RA1-PA542&amp;dq=%22robert+reece%22+benefit+play+london&amp;source=web&amp;ots=mPgy_EebRu&amp;sig=3xr-gTdElh5MxbMKRoRKFqXq9tw#PPA23,M1 A Dictionary of the Drama, ''Agamemnon and Cassandra'' described on p. 23]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
He wrote many other burlesques for the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]], the [[Olympic Theatre]] (including ''Richelieu'' in 1873 and ''Clockwork'' in 1877),&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;&lt;ref name=programmes&gt;[http://www.gilbertandsullivanonline.com/programm.htm Programme listings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420221553/http://www.gilbertandsullivanonline.com/programm.htm |date=20 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] (including ''Green Old Age'', with music by [[Frederic Clay]], in 1874; and a burlesque, ''Ruy Blas Righted''),&lt;ref name=programmes/&gt; the [[Royal Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]], and the Gaiety. At the Gaiety, he produced fourteen pieces between 1872 and 1884, among them the [[pantomime]]s ''Ali Baba'' (1872), ''Don Giovanni in Venice'' (1873), ''[[The Forty Thieves]],'' (written with [[Francis Burnand|F. C. Burnand]], [[H. J. Byron]] and [[W. S. Gilbert]]) (1878) and another version of the same story, with music by [[Meyer Lutz]] in 1880;&lt;ref&gt;"The Gaiety", ''The Times'', 25 December 1880, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and the burlesques ''Aladdin,'' (1881); ''Little Robin Hood,'' (1882); and ''[[Valentine and Orson]],'' (1882).

He collaborated with [[Henry Brougham Farnie]] on 15 libretti or adaptations and occasionally joined with other dramatic writers.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; With Farnie, for the [[Folly Theatre]] in London, he wrote ''Up the River, or the Strict Kew-Tea'' (1877);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operetta-research-center.org/main.php?task=archart&amp;cat=4&amp;sub_cat=10&amp;id=00090 Information from the Operetta Research Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727081746/http://www.operetta-research-center.org/main.php?task=archart&amp;cat=4&amp;sub_cat=10&amp;id=00090 |date=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stars and Garters'' (1878); his biggest success, ''[[Les cloches de Corneville]]'' (1878); and ''The Creole''.  For the  [[Comedy Theatre]], he wrote ''Boccaccio'', with music by [[Franz von Suppé]] (1882).&lt;ref&gt;Adams, William Davenport. ''A Dictionary of the Drama (1904) 1904 Chatto &amp; Windus, London&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote the successful burlesque, ''Carmen; or Sold for a Song'' (1879) for the Folly Theatre.  ''The Highest Bidder'' played in New York in 1887, starring [[E. H. Sothern]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/04/24/103141659.pdf New York Times article of 24 April 1887]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=393134 Information about ''The Highest Bidder'' from the IBDB database]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, he wrote ''Cattarina'', a comic opera with music by Frederic Clay, produced at the [[Charing Cross Theatre]], and in 1879 he wrote the comic opera ''La Petite Mademoiselle'', together with [[Henry Sambrooke Leigh]], for the [[Alhambra Theatre]].  Also for the Alhambra, in 1881 he wrote an English-language adaptation of ''Jeanne, Jeannette and Jeanneton'', a grand opera by P. Lacome after an original libretto by Clairville &amp; Delacour.&lt;ref name=programmes/&gt;

Despite all of his successful work, Reece fell on hard times in the 1880s.  He died in London at the age of 53 and was buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].

[[File:Liszt at piano.jpg|thumb|right|[[Franz Liszt]], one of the deceased musicians Brown claimed to have communicated with]]

Rosemary Isabel Dickeson was born in London in 1916. She claimed to have been only seven years old when she was first introduced to the world of dead musicians. She reported that a [[Apparitional experience|spirit]] with long white hair and a flowing black cassock appeared and told her he was a composer and would make her a famous musician one day. She did not know who he was until, about ten years later, she saw a picture of [[Franz Liszt]]. Many other members of Brown's family were allegedly psychic, including her parents and grandparents.

She worked for the Post Office from the age of 15. In 1948 she acquired a second-hand upright piano, and took some lessons for three years.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{Cite news

Then in 1964 Liszt supposedly renewed contact and Brown began transcribing original compositions she said were dictated to her by great musicians of the past. Brown transcribed pieces from [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Edvard Grieg]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and Liszt. These included a 40-page sonata she attributed to Schubert, a Fantaisie-Impromptu in three movements she attributed to Chopin, 12 songs she attributed to Schubert, and two sonatas and two symphonies she attributed to Beethoven.

Brown claimed that each composer had his own way of dictating to her: Liszt controlled her hands for a few bars at a time, and then she wrote down the notes; Chopin told her the notes and pushed her hands on to the right keys; Schubert tried to sing his compositions; and Beethoven and Bach simply dictated the notes. She claimed the composers spoke to her in English.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Rosemary. (1971). ''Unfinished Symphonies''. William Morrow. p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

Brown's irrational claims about spirit communication were disputed by [[Skeptical movement|skeptics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/rosemarybrown.html "Rosemary Brown (1916–2001)"]. The Skeptic's Dictionary. Accessed 9 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

After studying her compositions, [[Musicology|musicologist]]s and [[psychologist]]s came to the conclusion they were the work of Brown's own subconscious. [[Leonard Zusne]] and Warren H. Jones in their book ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking'' (1989) noted that "Brown wrote hundreds of pieces of music dictated by the various composers. They were passable works, entirely in the style of these composers, but appeared to be simply reworkings of existing pieces."&lt;ref&gt;Zusne, Leonard; Jones, Warren H. (1989). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. p. 105. {{ISBN|978-0-805-80507-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of psychology [[John Sloboda]] wrote that Brown's music offers "the most convincing case of unconscious composition on a large scale."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Matthew. (2012). ''Debussy Redux: The Impact of His Music on Popular Culture''. Indiana University Press. pp. 36–37. {{ISBN|978-0-253-35716-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Robert Kastenbaum analysed Brown's music compositions and came to doubt that they were dictated to Brown by [[spirit]]s of well known composers. According to Kastenbaum:

{{blockquote|There is no striking themes, complex structures, depths of feelings, or harmonic, tonal, or rhythmic innovations. During their days on earth all the composers not only created distinguished music but also contributed to the development of compositions for the keyboard. One of the characteristics that made each of them so remarkable was their unpredictability. Their next composition might well open a new domain in musical sensitivity or technique. Alas, they have now all fallen into desuetude. Nothing new shows up to enrich their post-mortem compositions, and nothing surprises, except perhaps the lack of surprises.&lt;ref name="Kastenbaum1984"&gt;Kastenbaum, Robert. (1984). ''Is There Life After Death?''. Rider and Company. pp. 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kastenbaum suggested the composers were secondary personalities of Brown herself.&lt;ref name="Kastenbaum1984"/&gt;

Brown maintained that she had never had any musical training aside from a few piano lessons, though  paranormal investigator Harry Edwards says:&lt;ref name="skepticsguide"&gt;{{cite book |title=A skeptic's guide to the New Age |chapter=Rosemary Brown (1931&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;) | last = Edwards| first = Harry|publisher=Australian Skeptics |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-646-24502-7}} (from [http://users.adam.com.au/bstett/PaBrown104.htm on-line copy] in ''Investigator'' (104), September 2005, retrieved 29 September 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A perusal of newspaper reports about Ms. Brown elicits contradictory information about her alleged lack of musical education. Originally she stated that she had had no musical training; later she was reported to have had only a couple of years of music lessons, and recently admitted to belonging to a musical household and being a competent musician and pianist.}}

According to the psychologist Andrew Neher:

{{quote|[Brown] loved music as a child, there was a piano in her home while she was growing up, her mother played the piano, and she herself took piano lessons. All of this, together with the enhanced skill often displayed in altered states of consciousness, seems sufficient to account for her musical compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Neher, Andrew. (2011). ''Paranormal and Transcendental Experience: A Psychological Examination''. Dover Publications. p. 208. {{ISBN|0-486-26167-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Musicologist [[Denis Matthews]] described her music as "charming pastiches" and suggested she was re-creating compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Dennis. (1969). ''The Story of Rosemary Brown''. ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly [[Alan Rich]], music critic of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, having heard a privately issued record of Brown's piano pieces, concluded that they were just sub-standard re-workings of some of their purported composers' better-known compositions.

Concert pianists [[Peter Katin]], Philip Gammon, [[Howard Shelley]], [[Cristina Ortiz]] and [[John Lill]] have all performed her music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The '''Royal Band of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]''' (''Banda Real de Castilla'') was the [[heraldic flag]] of the monarchs of the [[Crown of Castile]], a personal banner of military use, distinctive indicating to the troops the presence of the monarch and allowed them to have identified his position in the battles. This insignia, who joined in the symbolism of the king of Castile to heraldic flag with the [[Heraldry of Castile|Castile]] and [[Heraldry of León|Leonese arms]], was created in 1332 by the king [[Alfonso XI of Castile]], although its origin probably would go back to one of the primitive symbols of the [[County of Castile|Counts of Castile]], which had consisted of a gold bend on [[gules]] (red). The dragantes appeared on the handpiece or [[Baton (military)|baton]] when [[Scipio Aemilianus|Scipio]] brought the Roman legions to [[Hispania]].

Alfonso XI founded the [[Order of the Band|Order of the Royal Band of Castile]] to reward the best services to the sovereign.

The Band of Castile was used by all the monarchs that had Castile until [[Charles V, Holy Roman Empire]]. It consisted, from the reign of [[Henry IV of Castile]], on a reddish flag, probably [[purple]] scarlet, with a golden [[Bend (heraldry)|bend]] of throaty dragantes heads of the same color.

The dragantes are the heraldic representation of [[dragon]]s.

Prior to the reign of Henry IV, the colors were something changing and have been preserved representations of the Royal Band of Castile in the reign of [[Peter of Castile]] with dragantes of white and black color  band.

The Band of Castile description from [[Henry I of Castile|Henry I]] reign was: ''Gules, a bend or engouled into dragantes'' ([[dragon]] or [[wolf]]'s heads). Before, the bend and the dragon's heads were different colours.

The Castilian Band origin was the old Count of Castile's coat of arms ''Gules a bend Or'' -, after "''Gules, a three towered castle Or''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://sca.historiaviva.org/tiki-index.php?page_ref_id=284&amp;PHPSESSID=21da30dd4db01b9cd0560c349b13ba6a Band of Castile. Alcázar de Briosa]&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Catholic Monarchs]] used the Castilian Band between a yoke with ribbons Or (on obverse side) and a sheaf of arrows with ribbons Or (on reverse side) and their motto: ''Tanto Monta, Monta Tanto'' ("cutting as untying") an explanation of the equality of the monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armada.mde.es/ArmadaPortal/appmanager/ArmadaPortal/ArmadaPortal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=ap_page_conocenosHistoria_presentacion&amp;pathNodo=%2FBEA+Repository%2Fdesktop_armada_portal%2Fap_book_main%2Fbb_ap_book_conocenos%2Fee_ap_book_conocenos_historia%2FCC_Bandera%2FCC_ReyesCatolicos The Bend of Castile of Catolic Monarchs, Spanish Navy website.

*[[Francisco Franco]], [[General]] and [[Head of State]] of Spain, used from 1940 to 1975 the Castilian Band (like the version of Charles I) as Head of State’s Standard and Guidon: The Bend between the Pillars of Hercules, crowned with an imperial crown and open (old) royal crown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fotw.net/flags/es^cs940.html Standard and guindon of Francisco Franco, Flags of the World]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bend between the Pillars of Hercules also were depicting in the personal coat of arms used by Franco as Head of [[Spain under Franco|Spanish State]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.es/USERS/fnff/testamentoventa.htm www.ctv.es (Fundación Francisco Franco), Arms Image]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generalisimofranco.com/Album/vida/pagB.htm www.generalisimofranco.com, Arms image]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walter Paye Lane''' (February 18, 1817 – January 28,&lt;ref name=death /&gt; 1892) was a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] general during the [[American Civil War]] who also served in the armies of the [[Republic of Texas]] and the [[United States|United States of America]].

==Early life==
Lane was born in [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]]. The Lane family emigrated to [[Fairview, Ohio|Fairview]] in [[Guernsey County, Ohio]], in 1821, and moved to [[Kentucky]] in 1825. In 1836 Lane moved to [[Texas]] to participate in its [[Texas Revolution|war for independence]] against [[Mexico]]. After Texas had gained its independence, Lane lived in [[San Augustine County, Texas|San Augustine County]] in [[East Texas]] and then [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], where he briefly served as a [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]]. In 1846 Lane joined the First Regiment, Texas Mounted Riflemen, as a [[First Lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] to fight in the [[Mexican–American War]]. Lane fought with honors at the [[Battle of Monterey]] and was later given the rank of [[Major (United States)|major]] and command of his own [[battalion]]. After the Mexican–American War, Lane wandered about doing various things in [[Arizona]], [[California]], and [[Peru]] before opening a mercantile business in [[Marshall, Texas]], in 1858.

==Civil War==
When the Civil War broke out, Lane was among the first Texans to call for [[secession]]. Lane's military reputation was so great that the first volunteer Confederate company raised in [[Harrison County, Texas|Harrison County]] was named for him, though Lane would join the 3rd Texas Cavalry. Lane participated in the battles of [[Battle of Wilson's Creek|Wilson's Creek, Missouri]], [[Battle of Chustenahlah|Chustenahlah]], [[Battle of Pea Ridge|Pea Ridge]] and both the [[Siege of Corinth]] and [[Second Battle of Corinth]]. Lane led the 3rd Texas at the battle of [[Franklin, Mississippi]], and was commended by General [[P.G.T. Beauregard]] for his efforts. Lane was severely wounded in the [[Battle of Mansfield]] in 1864, where Confederates forces rebuffed a push to capture either or both [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], or Marshall, Texas. Before the war ended, Lane was promoted to the rank of [[Brigadier General#United States|brigadier general]] in 1865, being confirmed on the last day the [[Congress of the Confederate States|Confederate Congress]] met.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, p. 174. His date of rank was March 17, 1865, confirmed March 18, 1865.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postbellum career==
After the Civil War Lane returned to Marshall where he helped to establish the [[Texas Veterans Association]]. After [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], Lane and his brother George, a local [[judge]], founded the first [[White Citizens Party]] in Texas and ran [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]] and [[African-Americans]] out of Marshall. With [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] white hegemony brutally reestablished in Marshall and Harrison County, Lane declared the city and county "redeemed". He died in Marshall, Texas, and is buried in the Marshall Cemetery near downtown Marshall. His memoirs, ''The Adventures and Recollections of General Walter P. Lane'', were published posthumously in 1928.

'''Woody Woodpecker''' is an [[anthropomorphic]] [[animated]] [[woodpecker]] who appeared in theatrical short films produced by the [[Walter Lantz Studio]] and distributed by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]&lt;ref name="bcdb"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Universal_Studios/Walter_Lantz/Woody_Woodpecker/index.html|title= Woody Woodpecker Theatrical Cartoon List|publisher=Big Cartoon Database|date=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[golden age of American animation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Denis Gifford |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/04/woody-woodpecker-cartoon-film-festival-archive |title=Woody Woodpecker shoots to the top of the cartoon tree: From the archive, 4 July 1972 &amp;#124; Film |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woody was created in 1940 by [[Walter Lantz|Lantz]] and [[storyboard]] artist [[Ben Hardaway|Ben "Bugs" Hardaway]], who had previously laid the groundwork for two other screwball characters, [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Daffy Duck]], at the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros. cartoon studio]] in the late 1930s. Woody's character and design evolved over the years, from an insane bird with an unusually garish design to a more refined looking and acting character in the vein of the later [[Chuck Jones]] version of Bugs Bunny. Woody was originally voiced by prolific voice actor [[Mel Blanc]], who was succeeded by Danny Webb, [[Kent Rogers]], &lt;!-- Do not remove Danny Webb and Kent Rogers --&gt; Ben Hardaway and finally by [[Grace Stafford]], wife of Walter Lantz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=A. Folkart|first= Burt|title=Gracie Lantz Dies; Invented Woody Woodpecker|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-19/local/me-5718_1_woody-woodpecker| accessdate=August 24, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 19, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lantz produced theatrical cartoons longer than most of his contemporaries, and Woody Woodpecker remained a staple of Universal's release schedule until 1972, when Lantz finally closed down his studio. The character has been revived since then for special productions and occasions as well as for ''[[The New Woody Woodpecker Show]]'', a late 1990s/early 2000s [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] [[Saturday-morning cartoon]] [[television series]] that featured prolific voice actor [[Billy West]] as Woody.

''Woody Woodpecker'' cartoons were first broadcast on television in 1957 under the title ''[[The Woody Woodpecker Show]]'', which featured Lantz cartoons bookended by new footage of Woody and live-action footage of Lantz. Woody has a motion picture star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] on 7000 Hollywood Boulevard. He also made a [[cameo appearance]] alongside many other famous cartoon characters in the 1988 film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.

Woody Woodpecker and friends are also icons at the [[Universal Parks &amp; Resorts|Universal Studios Theme Parks]] worldwide, as well as the [[PortAventura Park]] in the [[PortAventura World]], [[Salou, Spain]] (they were originally brought to the park by [[Universal Studios]], and remain there today despite Universal no longer having a financial stake in the park). Woody Woodpecker's latest appearance was in [[Woody Woodpecker (2017 film)|a self-titled Live-Action/CGI hybrid film]], which was theatrically released in [[Brazil]] on October 5, 2017 and was panned by critics. The film was later distributed on DVD in the [[United States]] on February 6, 2018 and is currently streaming on [[Netflix]].

== Origin ==
According to [[Walter Lantz]]'s [[press agent]], the idea for Woody came during the producer's honeymoon with his wife, [[Grace Stafford|Gracie]], in [[Lake Sherwood, California]]. A noisy [[acorn woodpecker]]&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zickefoose|first=Julie|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101665227 |title=Woody The Acorn (Not Pileated) Woodpecker |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=March 10, 2009 |accessdate=January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; outside their cabin kept the couple awake at night, and when a heavy rain started, they learned that the bird had bored holes in their cabin's roof. As both Walter and Gracie told Dallas attorney Rod Phelps during a visit, Walter wanted to shoot the bird, but Gracie suggested that her husband make a cartoon about the bird, and thus Woody was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVShFCjVzvIC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=wally+walrus+woody+woodpecker&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x1DtTsj0GMHL8QP3taDrCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=wally%20walrus%20woody%20woodpecker&amp;f=false |title=Who's Who in Animated Cartoons: An International Guide to Film &amp; Television ... - Jeff Lenburg – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woody shares many characteristics in common with the [[pileated woodpecker]] in terms of both physical appearance as well as his characteristic laugh, which resembles the call of the pileated woodpecker. These similarities are apparently the result of the [[artistic license]] of the creators, and have caused much confusion within the [[Birdwatching|birding]] community amongst those who have attempted to classify Woody's species.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

== History ==
=== Early years ===
Woody Woodpecker first appeared in the short ''[[Knock Knock (1940 film)|Knock Knock]]'' on November 25, 1940. The cartoon ostensibly stars [[Andy Panda]] and his father, [[Papa Panda]], but it is Woody who dominates. The [[woodpecker]] constantly pesters the two [[panda]]s, apparently just for the fun of it. Andy, meanwhile, tries to sprinkle salt on Woody's tail in the belief that this will somehow capture the bird. To Woody's surprise, Andy's attempts prevail, and Woody is taken away to the [[psychiatric hospital]]— but not before his captors prove to be crazier than he is.

The Woody of ''Knock Knock'' was designed by animator [[Alex Lovy]]. Woody's original [[voice actor]], [[Mel Blanc]], stopped performing the character after the first two cartoons to work exclusively for [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions]] (Later renamed [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]), producer of [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]''. At Leon Schlesinger's, Blanc had already established the voices of two other famous "screwball" characters who preceded Woody, [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Bugs Bunny]]. Ironically, Blanc's characterization of the Woody Woodpecker laugh had originally been applied to [[Happy Rabbit]], a Bugs Bunny predecessor (which was Bugs Bunny originally, but different) in shorts such as the aforementioned ''[[Elmer's Candid Camera]]'' and was later transferred to Woody. Blanc's regular speaking voice for Woody was much like the early [[Daffy Duck]], minus the lisp. Once Warner Bros. signed Blanc to an exclusive contract, Woody's voice-over work was taken over by Danny Webb, followed by [[Kent Rogers]]. &lt;!-- Do not remove Danny Webb and Kent Rogers --&gt; [[Ben Hardaway]] later became Woody's voice after Rogers was killed in a plane crash during [[World War II]], and would voice the woodpecker for the rest of the decade. Despite this, Blanc continued to voice Woody on a Mutual Network radio show&lt;ref&gt;[http://tralfaz.blogspot.com/2015/08/woody-woodpecker-arrives-on-tv.html"Woody Woodpecker Arrives on TV"]. Retrieved 2017-09-22.&lt;/ref&gt; and in recordings for [[Capitol Records]] from 1948 until 1955,&lt;ref&gt;Ohmart, Ben; Mitchell, Walt (2012). ''Mel Blanc: The Man of a Thousand Voices''. Bear Manor Media. {{ISBN|978-1593937881}}. P.108.&lt;/ref&gt; while his laugh would continue to be used in the shorts until 1951.

Audiences reacted well to ''Knock Knock'', and Lantz realized he had finally hit upon a star to replace the waning [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]]. Woody starred in a number of films. With his innate chutzpah and brash demeanor, the character was a natural hit during World War II. His image appeared on US aircraft as [[nose art]], and on mess halls, and audiences on the homefront watched Woody cope with familiar problems such as food shortages. The 1943 Woody cartoon ''[[The Dizzy Acrobat]]'' was nominated for the 1944 [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons)]], which it lost to the MGM ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoon ''[[The Yankee Doodle Mouse]]''. Woody Woodpecker's debut also marked a change in directing style for Walter Lantz studio, since the character was heavily inspired by [[Tex Avery]]-created Looney Tunes character Daffy Duck at Warner Bros, and thus Woody's cartoons tended to have a hint of Tex Avery's style and influence in terms of humor, and that's what gave Walter Lantz studio its fame. Curiously enough, Avery himself never directed a Woody Woodpecker short while at the Walter Lantz studio.

[[File:Barber-of-seville-2.jpg|right|thumb|Woody Woodpecker and his captive client in ''[[The Barber of Seville (1944 film)|The Barber of Seville]]'' (1944), directed by [[Shamus Culhane]].]]
Animator [[Emery Hawkins]] and layout artist Art Heinemann streamlined Woody's appearance for the 1944 film ''[[The Barber of Seville (cartoon)|The Barber of Seville]]'', directed by [[Shamus Culhane]]. The bird became rounder, cuter, and less demented. He also sported a simplified color scheme and a brighter smile, making him much more like his counterparts at [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros.]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM]]. Nevertheless, [[Shamus Culhane|Culhane]] continued to use Woody as an aggressive lunatic, not a domesticated straight man or defensive homebody, as many other studios' characters had become. The follow-up to ''The Barber of Seville'', ''[[The Beach Nut]]'', introduced Woody's original chief nemesis, [[Wally Walrus]].

Woody's wild days were numbered, however. In 1946, Lantz hired [[Walt Disney|Disney]] veteran [[Dick Lundy (animator)|Dick Lundy]] to direct Woody's cartoons. Lundy rejected Culhane's take on the series and made Woody more defensive; no longer did the bird go insane without a legitimate reason. Lundy also paid more attention to the animation, making Woody's new films more Disney-esque in their design, style, animation, and timing. Lundy's last film for Disney was the [[Donald Duck]] short ''Flying Jalopy''. This cartoon is played much like a Woody Woodpecker short, down to the laugh in the end. It also features a [[bad guy]] named "Ben Buzzard" who bears a strong resemblance to [[Buzz Buzzard]], a Lantz character introduced in ''[[Wet Blanket Policy]]'' (1948), who eventually succeeded [[Wally Walrus]] as Woody's primary antagonist.

In 1947, contract renewal negotiations between Lantz and Universal (now Universal-International) fell through, and Lantz began distributing his cartoons through [[United Artists]].&lt;ref name="UA"&gt;Adamson, Joe (1985). ''The Walter Lantz Story''. New York: Putnam Books.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|161}} The UA-distributed Lantz cartoons featured higher-quality animation, the influence of Dick Lundy (the films' budgets remained the same).&lt;ref name="UA" /&gt;{{rp|172–175}} Former Disney animators such as [[Fred Moore (animator)|Fred Moore]] and [[Ed Love]] began working at Lantz, and assisted Lundy in adding touches of the Disney style to Woody's cartoons. Despite the Disney style added for the later cartoons, Woody's cartoons still try to maintain a good dose of slapstick and madcap humor from the pre-Lundy cartoons.

[[File:Woody-wet-blanket-policy.jpg|thumb|''[[Wet Blanket Policy]]'', directed by [[Dick Lundy (animator)|Dick Lundy]], introduced Woody's new adversary [[Buzz Buzzard]] and featured Woody's [[Academy Award]]-nominated theme song, "The Woody Woodpecker Song."]]

=== "The Woody Woodpecker Song" ===
In 1947, Woody got his own theme song when musicians [[George Tibbles]] and [[Ramey Idriss]] wrote "The Woody Woodpecker Song", making ample use of the character's famous laugh. [[Kay Kyser]]'s 1948 recording of the song, with [[Harry Babbitt]]'s laugh interrupting vocalist [[Gloria Wood]], became one of the biggest hit singles of 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitburn|first1=Joel|title=Joel Whitburn's Pop Memories 1890–1954|date=1986|publisher=Record Research Inc|location=Wisconsin, USA|isbn=0-89820-083-0|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists did covers, including Woody's original voice actor, [[Mel Blanc]]. Lantz first used "The Woody Woodpecker Song" in  ''[[Wet Blanket Policy]]'' (1948), and it became the first and only song from an animated short subject to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original  Song#1940s|Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in 1948 but it lost out to “[[Buttons and Bows]]”.&lt;ref name="feature"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kit|first=Borys|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/woody-woodpecker-movie-universal-illumination-262540|title=Woody Woodpecker Movie in Development at Universal, Illumination (Exclusive)|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|date=November 16, 2011|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lantz soon adopted the song as Woody's theme music, and due to the song's popularity, Woody Woodpecker fan clubs sprang up, theaters held "Woody" matinées, and boys got the "Woody Woodpecker" haircut.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

"The Woody Woodpecker Song" and the ''Woody Woodpecker'' cartoons made extensive use of Woody's famous laugh, upsetting the man who created it, Mel Blanc. (He first used the laugh, in a different recording, for the seminal pre-Bugs Bunny character in 1938's ''[[Porky's Hare Hunt]]''.) Although Blanc had only recorded three shorts as the voice of Woody, his laugh had been recorded as a stock sound effect and used in every subsequent ''Woody Woodpecker'' short up until this point. Blanc sued Lantz and lost, but Lantz settled out of court when Blanc filed an appeal. Although Lantz stopped using Blanc's Woody Woodpecker laugh as a stock effect in the early 1950s, Blanc's voice was still heard saying "Guess who?" at the beginning of every cartoon for the duration of the ''Woody Woodpecker'' series.

=== Later films ===

Financial problems at United Artists during the aftermath of the [[Paramount case]] affected Lantz. By the end of 1948, Lantz had shut down his studio;&lt;ref name="UA" /&gt; he reopened it in 1950 with a downsized staff.

Beginning with the 1950 feature film ''[[Destination Moon (film)|Destination Moon]]'', which featured a segment of Woody explaining [[rocket propulsion]], Woody's voice was assumed by Lantz's wife, [[Grace Stafford]]. According to the Lantzes, Stafford slipped a recording of herself into a stack of audition tapes, and her husband chose her without knowing her identity.&lt;ref name="UA" /&gt;{{rp|185–186}} Lantz also began having Stafford supply Woody's laugh, possibly due to the court case with Mel Blanc. Stafford was not credited at her own request until ''[[Misguided Missile]]'' (1958), as she felt audiences might reject a woman performing Woody's voice. Stafford also did her best to tone down the character through her voice work, to appease Universal's complaints about Woody's [[raucousness]].

Lantz signed again with Universal (now Universal-International) in 1950, and began production on two entries that director Dick Lundy and storymen Ben Hardaway and [[Heck Allen]] had begun before the 1948 layoff. These shorts have no director's credit, as Lantz claimed to have directed them himself. ''[[Puny Express]]'' (1951) was the first to be released, followed by ''[[Sleep Happy]]''. These shorts marked a departure from past dialogue-driven shorts. Though Stafford now voiced Woody, her job was limited, as Woody (and other characters) rarely spoke in the first dozen or so shorts. It was because of these entries that Woody became popular outside the [[English-speaking world]], thanks to the lack of a language barrier. (''[[The Pink Panther (character)|The Pink Panther]]'' shorts of the 1960s and 1970s also enjoyed worldwide popularity due to this [[pantomime]] luxury.)

Nine more Lantz-directed Woody cartoons followed, before [[Don Patterson (animator)|Don Patterson]] became Woody's new director in 1953. The bird was redesigned again, this time by [[animator]] [[LaVerne Harding]]. Harding made Woody smaller, cuter, and moved his crest forward from its original backwards position. (The small Lantz Studios logo seen at the start of every cartoon — Woody as an armored knight on horseback carrying a [[lance]] — continued for a while to display Woody with his former topknot.) For 1955's ''[[The Tree Medic]]'', one last makeover was given to the woodpecker, making Woody's eye a simple black dot and taking away the green/hazel iris he'd had since his beginnings. However, Woody's eyes were not changed in the cartoon's intros, and they remained green for the rest of the shorts' production run. During this time, the intro was changed as well. Instead of having Woody's name on screen and Woody pecking a hole in the screen to introduce himself, Woody pecked his way onto the screen, say "Guess who?", peck his name on either a brown or gray wood background, and flip and flop around the screen, laughing.

By 1955, [[Paul J. Smith (director)|Paul J. Smith]] had taken over as primary director of Woody's shorts, with periodic fill-in shorts directed by Alex Lovy and [[Jack Hannah]], among others. With Smith on board, the shorts maintained a healthy dose of frenetic energy, while the animation itself was simplified, due to budget constraints.

[[File:Birddinner02.jpg|right|thumb|Woody in 1961's ''[[The Bird Who Came to Dinner]]'', directed by [[Paul Smith (animator)|Paul J. Smith]]. This cartoon was made several years after [[Woody Woodpecker filmography|Woody's]] last redesign.]]
In addition to Lantz's wife Grace Stafford providing Woody's voice, which returned the cartoon to being more dialogue-driven again, voice talents during this period were generally split between [[Dallas McKennon|Dal McKennon]] and [[Daws Butler]]. Several of Woody's recurring costars were also introduced during this era, such as [[Gabby Gator]] (voiced by [[Daws Butler]] in an Ozarks voice, a slightly different southern dialect than he used for [[Huckleberry Hound]]). Gabby first appeared in ''[[Everglade Raid]]'' (as "Al I. Gator"). Other films paired Woody with a girlfriend, Winnie Woodpecker (voiced by [[Grace Stafford]]), and a niece and nephew, Splinter and Knothead (both voiced by [[June Foray]]). Other antagonists that Woody has dealt with were Ms. Meany (voiced by [[Grace Stafford]]) and [[Dapper Denver Dooley]] (voiced by [[Dallas McKennon]]).

=== Woody in the television era ===
As Lantz was struggling financially, Woody's longevity was secured when he made the jump to television in ''[[The Woody Woodpecker Show]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The half-hour program consisted of three theatrical Woody shorts followed by a brief look at cartoon creation hosted by Lantz. It ran from 1957 to 1958 then entered syndication until 1966. [[NBC]] revived the show in 1970 and 1976. In addition, the woodpecker was no longer dishing out abuse to his foils, but was instead on the receiving end. The first significant short to feature Woody as a serious, put-upon character was 1961's ''[[Franken-Stymied]]''. Woody's popularity had been based on his manic craziness, but by 1961, this had all but been eliminated in favor of a more serious Woody, a straight man trying to do good. This was due in part to Woody's large presence on television, which meant Lantz had to meet the stringent rules against violence for children's television. Though production continued until 1972, the cartoons were a definite notch lower than in the 1940s and 1950s.

Woody appeared in new theatrical shorts until 1972, when Lantz closed his studio due to rising production costs. His cartoons returned to syndication in the late 1970s. Lantz sold his library of Woody shorts to [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]/[[Universal Studios|Universal]] in 1985. Universal repackaged the cartoons for another syndicated ''Woody Woodpecker Show'' in 1987. A year later, Woody cameoed in ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'', voiced by Cherry Davis, near the end of the film.

Woody Woodpecker reappeared in the [[Fox Kids]] series ''[[The New Woody Woodpecker Show]]'', which ran on Saturday mornings from 1999 to 2002, voiced by [[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]]. For this series, Woody was redesigned more like his mid-1940s look (1944 to 1949), pushing back his crest and making his eyes green again. Winnie Woodpecker, who had debuted in ''[[Real Gone Woody]]'' (1954), became a semi-regular character as Woody's primary love interest. Like Woody, Winnie was redesigned to look almost exactly like Woody did from 1950 until 1972, the obvious differences being that she was a female woodpecker and had blue eyes. Woody's primary antagonist was Wally Walrus, who became Woody's neighbor (Woody lived in a tree house in Mrs. Meany's front yard, and Mrs. Meany's house was next door). Buzz Buzzard often appeared, as did Mrs. Meany and several other older characters.

Woody and Winnie both appear as costumed characters at [[PortAventura Park]], [[Universal Orlando]], [[Universal Studios Japan]], [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and [[Universal Studios Singapore]].

=== Legacy ===
Walter Lantz and movie pioneer [[George Pal]] were good friends. Woody Woodpecker cameos in nearly every film that Pal produced or directed—for example, during the 1966 sequence in ''[[The Time Machine (1960 film)|The Time Machine]]'' (1960), a little girl drops her Woody Woodpecker doll as she goes into an air raid shelter. In ''[[Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze]]'' (1975), Grace Stafford cameos, carrying a Woody Woodpecker doll.

Woody was number 46 on ''[[TV Guide]]'''s list of the 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time in 2002 and 2003. He came in at number 25 on [[Animal Planet]]'s list of ''The 50 Greatest Movie Animals'' in 2004. The character has been referenced and spoofed on many later television programs, among them ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Three's Company]]'', and Flash Toons.

Woody Woodpecker is the mascot for the [[Universal Studios Theme Parks]]. In 1998 and 1999, Woody appeared on the nose of the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] [[Formula One]] Team, and in 2000, he became the official team mascot of the [[Honda]] Motorcycle Racing Team. A Woody Woodpecker balloon had been a staple of the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] from 1982 until 1996.

In Brazil the character is hugely popular and iconic cartoon character in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wiseman |first1=Andreas |title=Universal Creates New Woody Woodpecker Episodes For YouTube Channels |url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/universal-new-woody-woodpecker-episodes-youtube-channels-1202508015/ |website=Deadline |date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== VHS and DVD releases ==
[[File:Woody Woodpecker HWoF Star.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Woody Woodpecker's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].]]
A handful of non-comprehensive Woody Woodpecker VHS tapes were issued by Universal in the 1980s and 1990s, usually including [[Andy Panda]] and [[Chilly Willy]] cartoons as bonuses. A few were widely released on VHS in the mid-1980s by [[Kid Pics Video]], an American company of dubious legality, which packaged the Woody cartoons with bootlegged [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] cartoons. In the early 2000s, a series of mail-order ''Woody Woodpecker Show'' VHS tapes and [[DVDs]] were made available by mail order through [[Columbia House]].

In 2007, [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] released ''The Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection'', a three-disc DVD boxed set compilation of Walter Lantz "Cartunes". The first forty-five Woody Woodpecker shorts—from ''[[Knock Knock (1940 cartoon)|Knock Knock]]'' to ''[[The Great Who-Dood-It]]''—were presented on the box set in chronological order of release, with various ''Chilly Willy'', ''Andy Panda'', ''Swing Symphonies'', and other Lantz shorts also included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homevideo.universalstudios.com/title.php?titleId=3200 |title=NBC Universal Store |publisher=Homevideo.universalstudios.com |date= |accessdate=January 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225055846/http://homevideo.universalstudios.com/title.php?titleId=3200# |archive-date=December 25, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection: Volume 2'', including the next forty-five Woody cartoons—''[[Termites from Mars]]'' through ''[[Jittery Jester]]''—was released in 2008.

Blanc originated the voice, in a characterization similar to his [[Daffy Duck]], minus the lisp, with the recording slightly sped up to give a higher-pitched tone to the voice. He stated that the laugh originated from a type of laugh he used to do at school and he just added the pecking sounds to the laugh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRlmb0xAtBs |title=Mel Blanc: The Man of a Thousand Voices |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2011-06-06 |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; That practice continued with other voice artists.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
