'''Acoustic jars''' are ceramic vessels found set into the walls, and sometimes into the sides of cavities beneath the floors, of medieval churches.  They are believed to have been intended to improve the sound of singing, and to have been inspired by the theories of [[Vitruvius]] .

==History==
Tuned bronze vases set in niches were used to modify the acoustics in Greek and Roman theatres. Their use is described by Vitruvius.&lt;ref name=god&gt;{{cite web|title=The enigma of Vitruvian Resonating Vases and the Relevance of the Concept for Today|author= Godman, Rob|url=http://www.philophony.com/pages/cr1470s.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   No original examples survive.&lt;ref name=isthere&gt;{{cite web|title=Is There an Acoustical Tradition in Western Architecture?|author=Crunelle, Marc| url=http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/skiathos2001/papers/102.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages the idea of the acoustic vessel re-emerged.  Examples have been found in around 200 churches, half of them in France.&lt;ref name=isthere/&gt; They vary greatly in shape and positioning, but, unlike those described by Vitruvius they are ceramic, and are found enclosed within the fabric of building.&lt;ref name=isthere/&gt;  The function of the jars was established with the discovery of a reference in the  ''Chronicle of the Celestins  of Metz''.  The chronicler recorded that, in 1432: &lt;blockquote&gt; on the vigil of the Assumption, after brother Odo le Roy, the prior, had returned from the before-mentioned general chapter, it was ordered that pots should be put into the choir of the church of this place, he stating that he had seen such in a church elsewhere  thinking that they made the singing better, and resound more, they were put up there in one day, by taking as many workmen as were necessary.&lt;ref name=minns/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Modern experiments have indicated that their  effect would have been to absorb the resonance of certain frequencies, rather than to amplify sound.&lt;ref name=isthere/&gt;

They use of the jars was said to be common in [[Brittany]], and around  [[Clisson]], in the Loire Inferieure. In the Clisson area, they were usually found in horizontal rows at a height of about three metres above floor level.&lt;ref name=camb/&gt; In 1859 a correspondent to ''Archaeologia Cambrensis '' reported that at Pallet there was  "a  ''modern'' chapel, with earthenware vessels inserted in the walls of the choir, expressly for acoustic purposes".&lt;ref name=camb&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acoustic Contrivances in Churches And Other Buildings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qr41AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=|journal=Archaeologia Cambrensis|year=1859|pages=139–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, a set of eleven jars survives high on the chancel walls of St Andrews church at [[Lyddington]], Rutland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St Andrew's Church|url=http://www.openairlib.net/auralizationdb/content/st-andrews-church|website=Openair|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At [[St Peter Mancroft]]  in [[Norwich]] two L-shaped trenches  accommodating a number of acoustic jars were discovered beneath  the wooden floor on which the choir stalls had previously stood. They had rubble walls  and concrete bottoms, and the surfaces were rendered over. Earthenware jars were built into the walls at intervals of about three feet, with the mouths facing into the trench. The jars were about 9 ½  inches long, and 8 inches across at their widest, narrowing to 6 inches at the mouth.  A similar discovery was made at [[St Peter Parmentergate, Norwich]] in the same city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acoustic Pottery|journal=The Builder|author= Phipson|first=Makilwane|year=1863|page=893|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s21TAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22the+builder%22%22acoustic+pottery%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Fountains Abbey]], in [[Yorkshire]] several earthenware vessels were discovered mortared into the base of the choir screen, their necks protruding through the stonework.&lt;ref name=andrews&gt;{{cite book|pages=39–40|title=Antiquities and Curiosities of the Church|first=William|last=Andrews|location=London|publisher=William Andrews|year=1897|url=https://archive.org/details/antiquitiescurio00londrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of the medieval jars has sometimes been doubted. The Chronicler of Metz, in the only medieval source for the purpose of the jars,  mocks the prior for believing  that they might have improved the sound of the choir,&lt;ref name=minns&gt;{{cite journal|page=96|author=Minns, G.W.|title=Acoustic Pottery in Norwich Churches|url=https://archive.org/details/norfolkarchaeol29socigoog|journal=Norfolk archaeology |year=1872|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the archaeologist [[Ralph Merrifield]] suggested that their use might  have owed more to a tradition of [[votive offering|votive deposits]] than to the  theories of Vitruvius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Folk-lore in London Archaeology.

== History of ancient DNA studies ==

===1980s===
The first study of what would come to be called aDNA was conducted in 1984, when Russ Higuchi and colleagues at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] reported that traces of DNA from a museum specimen of the [[Quagga]] not only remained in the specimen over 150 years after the death of the individual, but could be extracted and sequenced.&lt;ref name="pmid6504142"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Higuchi R|author2=Bowman B|author3=Freiberger M|author4=Ryder OA|author5=Wilson AC |title=DNA sequences from the quagga, an extinct member of the horse family |journal=Nature |volume=312 |issue=5991 |pages=282–4 |date=1984 |pmid=6504142 |doi= 10.1038/312282a0|bibcode = 1984Natur.312..282H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two years, through investigations into natural and artificially mummified specimens, [[Svante Pääbo]] confirmed that this phenomenon was not limited to relatively recent museum specimens but could apparently be replicated in a range of [[Mummy|mummified]] human samples that dated as far back as several thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;Pääbo 1985a; Pääbo 1985b; Pääbo 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

The laborious processes that were required at that time to sequence such DNA (through [[bacterial cloning]]) were an effective brake on the development of the field of ancient DNA (aDNA). However, with the development of the [[Polymerase chain reaction|Polymerase Chain Reaction]] (PCR) in the late 1980s, the field began to progress rapidly.&lt;ref name="pmid3431465"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mullis KB|author2=Faloona FA |title=Specific synthesis of DNA in vitro via a polymerase-catalyzed chain reaction |journal=Meth.

Multiple primer, [[Nested polymerase chain reaction|nested PCR]] strategy was used to overcome those shortcomings.

=== 1990s ===
The post-PCR era heralded a wave of publications as numerous research groups tried their hands at aDNA. Soon a series of incredible findings had been published, claiming authentic DNA could be extracted from specimens that were millions of years old, into the realms of what Lindahl (1993b) has labelled [[Antediluvian]] DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Lindahl 1993b&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of such claims were based on the retrieval of DNA from organisms preserved in [[amber]]. Insects such as stingless bees,&lt;ref&gt;Cano ''et al.'' 1992a; Cano ''et al.'' 1992b&lt;/ref&gt; termites,&lt;ref&gt;De Salle ''et al.'' 1992; De Salle ''et al.'' 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and wood gnats,&lt;ref&gt;De Salle and Grimaldi 1994&lt;/ref&gt; as well as plant&lt;ref&gt;[[Hendrik Poinar|Poinar]] ''et al.'' 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and bacterial&lt;ref&gt;Cano ''et al.'' 1994&lt;/ref&gt; sequences were extracted from [[Dominica]]n amber dating to the [[Oligocene]] epoch. Still older sources of Lebanese amber-encased [[weevil]]s, dating to within the Cretaceous epoch, reportedly also yielded authentic DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Cano ''et al.'' 1993&lt;/ref&gt; DNA retrieval was not limited to amber.

Several sediment-preserved plant remains dating to the [[Miocene]] were successfully investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Golenberg ''et al.'' 1990; Golenberg 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1994 and to international acclaim, Woodward ''et al.'' reported the most exciting results to date&lt;ref name="pmid7973705"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Woodward SR|author2=Weyand NJ|author3=Bunnell M |title=DNA sequence from Cretaceous period bone fragments |journal=Science |volume=266 |issue=5188 |pages=1229–32 |date=November 1994 |pmid=7973705 |doi= 10.1126/science.7973705|bibcode = 1994Sci...266.1229W }}&lt;/ref&gt; — mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences that had apparently been extracted from dinosaur bones dating to more than 80 million years ago. When in 1995 two further studies reported dinosaur DNA sequences extracted from a Cretaceous egg,&lt;ref&gt;An ''et al.'' 1995; Li ''et al.'' 1995&lt;/ref&gt; it seemed that the field would revolutionize knowledge of the Earth's evolutionary past. Even these extraordinary ages were topped by the claimed retrieval of 250-million-year-old halobacterial sequences from [[halite]].&lt;ref name="pmid11057666"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vreeland RH|author2=Rosenzweig WD|author3=Powers DW |title=Isolation of a 250 million-year-old halotolerant bacterium from a primary salt crystal |journal=Nature |volume=407 |issue=6806 |pages=897–900 |date=October 2000 |pmid=11057666 |doi=10.1038/35038060 |bibcode=2000Natur.407..897V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12024211"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fish SA|author2=Shepherd TJ|author3=McGenity TJ|author4=Grant WD |title=Recovery of 16S ribosomal RNA gene fragments from ancient halite |journal=Nature |volume=417 |issue=6887 |pages=432–6 |date=May 2002 |pmid=12024211 |doi=10.1038/417432a |bibcode = 2002Natur.417..432F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Whole genome sequencing]] started to yield results in 1995.

===2000s===
Single primer extension (abr. SPEX) amplification was introduced in 2007 to address postmortem DNA modification damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Ancient DNA revolution ===
Since 2009 the field of aDNA-studies has been revolutionzed, with the introduction of much cheaper research-techniques, leading to new insights in human migrations.{{sfn|Reich|2018}}

== Problems and errors ==

===Degradation processes===
Due to degradation processes (including cross-linking, deamination and fragmentation) ancient DNA is of lower quality in comparison with modern genetic material.&lt;ref name="Allentoft, M.E. 2012"/&gt; The damage characteristics and ability of aDNA to survive through time restricts possible analyses and places an upper limit on the age of successful samples Allentoft ''et al.'' (2012). There is a theoretical correlation between time and DNA degradation,&lt;ref&gt;Hebsgaard, M.B., Phillips, M.J. &amp; Willerslev, E., 2005. Geologically ancient DNA: fact or artefact? Trends in microbiology, 13(5), pp.212–220.&lt;/ref&gt; although differences in environmental conditions complicates things. Samples subjected to different conditions are unlikely to predictably align to a uniform age-degradation relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, A.J. et al., 2006. Crosslinks rather than strand breaks determine access to ancient DNA sequences from frozen sediments. Genetics, 173(2), pp.1175–1179.&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental effects may even matter after excavation, as DNA decay rates may increase,&lt;ref&gt;Pruvost, M. et al., 2007. Freshly excavated fossil bones are best for amplification of ancient DNA. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 104(3), pp.739–744.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly under fluctuating storage conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Burger, J. et al., 1999. DNA preservation: a microsatellite-DNA study on ancient skeletal remains. Electrophoresis, 20(8), pp.1722–1728.&lt;/ref&gt; Even under the best preservation conditions, there is an upper boundary of 0.4-1.5 million years for a sample at around to contain sufficient DNA for contemporary sequencing technologies.&lt;ref name="Willerslev, E. 2004. pp.9"/&gt;

Research into the decay of [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] and [[nuclear DNA]] in [[Moa]] bones has modelled mitochondrial DNA degradation to an average length of 1 [[base pair]] after 6,830,000 years at −5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Allentoft ME|author2=Collins M|author3=Harker D|author4=Haile J|author5=Oskam CL|author6=Hale ML|author7=Campos PF|author8=Samaniego JA|author9=Gilbert MTP|author10=Willerslev E|author11=Zhang G|author12=Scofield RP|author13=Holdaway RN|author14=Bunce M |title=The half-life of DNA in bone: measuring decay kinetics in 158 dated fossils |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=279 |issue=1748|pages=4724–33 |date=2012 |doi= 10.1098/rspb.2012.1745 |pmid=23055061 |pmc=3497090}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The decay kinetics have been measured by accelerated aging experiments further displaying the strong influence of storage temperature and humidity on DNA decay.&lt;ref name=grass&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/anie.201411378| title = Robust Chemical Preservation of Digital Information on DNA in Silica with Error-Correcting Codes| journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition| volume = 54| issue = 8| pages = 2552–2555| year = 2015| last1 = Grass | first1 = R.

J. | pmid=25650567}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear DNA degrades at least twice as fast as mtDNA. As such, early studies that reported recovery of much older DNA, for example from [[Cretaceous]] [[dinosaur]] remains, may have stemmed from contamination of the sample.

A critical review of ancient DNA literature through the development of the field highlights that few studies after about 2002 have succeeded in amplifying DNA from remains older than several hundred thousand years.&lt;ref name="pmid12702808"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Willerslev E |title=Diverse plant and animal genetic records from Holocene and Pleistocene sediments |journal=Science |volume=300 |issue=5620 |pages=791–5 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12702808 |doi=10.1126/science.1084114 |name-list-format=vanc |author2=Hansen AJ |author3=Binladen J |display-authors=3 |last4=Brand |first4=TB |last5=Gilbert |first5=MT |last6=Shapiro |first6=B |last7=Bunce |first7=M |last8=Wiuf |first8=C |last9=Gilichinsky |first9=DA|bibcode = 2003Sci...300..791W }}&lt;/ref&gt; A greater appreciation for the risks of environmental contamination and studies on the chemical stability of DNA have resulted in concerns being raised over previously reported results.

aDNA may contain a large number of postmortem [[mutation]]s, increasing with time.

===Contamination===
Another problem with ancient DNA samples is contamination by modern human DNA and by microbial DNA (most of which is also ancient).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1101/gr.174201.114|pmid=25081630|title=Selective enrichment of damaged DNA molecules for ancient genome sequencing|journal=Genome Research|volume=24|issue=9|pages=1543–9|year=2014|last1=Gansauge|first1=Marie-Theres|last2=Meyer|first2=Matthias|pmc=4158764}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3390/genes9090445|pmid=30200636|pmc=6162538|title=Metagenomic Composition Analysis of an Ancient Sequenced Polar Bear Jawbone from Svalbard|journal=Genes|volume=9|issue=9|pages=445|year=2018|last1=Pratas|first1=Diogo|last2=Hosseini|first2=Morteza|last3=Grilo|first3=Goncalo|last4=Pinho|first4=Armando|last5=Silva|first5=Raquel|last6=Caetano|first6=Tania|last7=Carneiro|first7=Joao|last8=Pereira|first8=Filipe}}&lt;/ref&gt; New methods have emerged in recent years to prevent possible contamination of aDNA samples, including conducting extractions under extreme sterile conditions, using special adapters to identify endogenous molecules of the sample (over ones that may have been introduced during analysis), and applying bioinformatics to resulting sequences based on known reads in order approximate rates of contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slatkin|first=Montgomery|last2=Racimo|first2=Fernando|date=2016-06-07|title=Ancient DNA and human history|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/113/23/6380|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=113|issue=23|pages=6380–6387|doi=10.1073/pnas.1524306113|issn=0027-8424| pmc=4988579 |pmid=27274045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-human aDNA ==
Despite the problems associated with 'antediluvian' DNA, a wide and ever-increasing range of aDNA sequences have now been published from a range of animal and plant [[Taxon|taxa]].

In June 2013, a group of researchers announced that they had sequenced the DNA of a 560–780 thousand year old horse, using material extracted from a leg bone found buried in [[permafrost]] in Canada's [[Yukon]] territory.&lt;ref name="Hayden_2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/first-horses-arose-4-million-years-ago-1.13261 |title=First horses arose 4 million years ago |author=Erika Check Hayden |publisher=Nature |date=26 June 2013 |doi=10.1038/nature.2013.13261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a German team reconstructed the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial genome]] of an ''[[Ursus deningeri]]'' more than 300,000 years old, proving that authentic ancient DNA can be preserved for hundreds of thousand years outside of [[permafrost]].&lt;ref name="PNAS-2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dabney|title=Complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a Middle Pleistocene cave bear reconstructed from ultrashort DNA fragments |date=2013 |journal=[[PNAS]] |volume=110 |issue=39 |pages=15758–15763 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/09/04/1314445110.abstract |doi=10.1073/pnas.1314445110 |pmid=24019490 |accessdate=18 January 2014 |display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2013PNAS..11015758D |pmc=3785785 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers in 2016 measured chloroplast DNA in marine sediment cores, and found diatom DNA dating back to 1.4 million years. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=John B.|last2=Walsh|first2=Emily A.|last3=D’Hondt|first3=Steven|date=2016-07-08|title=Fossil DNA persistence and decay in marine sediment over hundred-thousand-year to million-year time scales|journal=Geology|language=en|volume=44|issue=8|pages=615–618|doi=10.1130/g37933.1|issn=0091-7613}}&lt;/ref&gt; This DNA had a half-life significantly longer than previous research, of up to 15,000 years. Kirkpatrick's team also found that DNA only decayed along a half-life rate until about 100 thousand years, at which point it followed a slower, power-law decay rate. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Human aDNA ==
Due to the considerable [[anthropology|anthropological]], [[archaeology|archaeological]], and [[public interest]] directed toward human remains, they have received considerable attention from the DNA community.

===Sources===
Due to the [[comparative anatomy|morphological]] preservation in mummies, many studies from the 1990s and 2000s used mummified tissue as a source of ancient human DNA. Examples include both naturally preserved specimens, for example, those preserved in ice, such as the [[Ötzi the Iceman]] (Handt ''et al.'' 1994), or through rapid [[desiccation]], such as high-altitude mummies from the Andes (c.f. [[Svante Pääbo|Pääbo]] 1986; Montiel ''et al.'' 2001), as well as various sources of artificially preserved tissue (such as the chemically treated mummies of ancient Egypt).&lt;ref name="pmid7806242"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hänni C|author2=Laudet V|author3=Coll J|author4=Stehelin D |title=An unusual mitochondrial DNA sequence variant from an Egyptian mummy |journal=Genomics |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=487–9 |date=July 1994 |pmid=7806242 |doi=10.1006/geno.1994.1417 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, mummified remains are a limited resource. The majority of human aDNA studies have focused on extracting DNA from two sources that are much more common in the [[archaeological record]] – [[bone]] and [[Tooth|teeth]]. Several other sources have also yielded DNA, including [[coprolite|paleofaeces]] ([[Hendrik Poinar|Poinar]] ''et al.'' 2001) and [[hair]] (Baker ''et al.'' 2001, Gilbert ''et al.'' 2004). Contamination remains a major problem when working on ancient human material.

Ancient [[pathogen]] DNA has been successfully retrieved from samples dating to more than 5,000 years old in humans and as long as 17,000 years ago in other species. In addition to the usual sources of mummified tissue, bones and teeth, such studies have also examined a range of other tissue samples, including calcified [[Pleural cavity|pleura]] (Donoghue ''et al.'' 1998), tissue embedded in [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]],&lt;ref name="pmid9448313"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jackson PJ |title=PCR analysis of tissue samples from the 1979 Sverdlovsk anthrax victims: The presence of multiple Bacillus anthracis strains in different victims |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=1224–9 |date=February 1998 |pmid=9448313 |pmc=18726 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.95.3.1224|name-list-format=vanc |author2=Hugh-Jones ME |author3=Adair DM |display-authors=3 |last4=Green |first4=G |last5=Hill |first5=KK |last6=Kuske |first6=CR |last7=Grinberg |first7=LM |last8=Abramova |first8=FA |last9=Keim |first9=P|bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.1224J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11226311"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Basler CF |title=Sequence of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus nonstructural gene (NS) segment and characterization of recombinant viruses bearing the 1918 NS genes |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=98 |issue=5 |pages=2746–51 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11226311 |pmc=30210 |doi=10.1073/pnas.031575198 |name-list-format=vanc |author2=Reid AH |author3=Dybing JK |display-authors=3 |last4=Janczewski |first4=TA |last5=Fanning |first5=TG |last6=Zheng |first6=H |last7=Salvatore |first7=M |last8=Perdue |first8=ML |last9=Swayne |first9=DE|bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.2746B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and formalin-fixed tissue.&lt;ref name="pmid9065404"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taubenberger JK|author2=Reid AH|author3=Krafft AE|author4=Bijwaard KE|author5=Fanning TG |title=Initial genetic characterization of the 1918 "Spanish" influenza virus |journal=Science |volume=275 |issue=5307 |pages=1793–6 |date=March 1997 |pmid=9065404 |doi= 10.1126/science.275.5307.1793}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficient computational tools have been developed for pathogen and microorganism aDNA analyses in a small ([http://qiime.org/ QIIME]) and large scale ([https://github.com/pratas/falcon FALCON] &lt;ref name="falcon"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pratas D|author2=Pinho AJ|author3=Silva RM|author4=Rodrigues JMOS|author5=Hosseini M|author6=Caetano T|author7=Ferreira PJSG |title=FALCON: a method to infer metagenomic composition of ancient DNA |journal=bioRxiv |date=February 2018 |doi= 10.1101/267179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Results===
Taking preventative measures in their procedure against such contamination though, a 2012 study analyzed bone samples of a [[Neanderthal]] group in the El Sidrón cave, finding new insights on potential kinship and genetic diversity from the aDNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lalueza-Fox|first=Carles|last2=Rosas|first2=Antonio|last3=Rasilla|first3=Marco de la|date=2012-01-20|title=Palaeogenetic research at the El Sidrón Neanderthal site|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0940960211000641?np=y&amp;npKey=50c2af6b383ff82df67ca0d3238643005ca917523d19fa8a4dddcf08e3623b6a|journal=Annals of Anatomy - Anatomischer Anzeiger|series=Special Issue: Ancient DNA|volume=194|issue=1|pages=133–137|doi=10.1016/j.aanat.2011.01.014|pmid=21482084|hdl=10261/79609}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, scientists reported finding a 110,000-year-old tooth containing DNA from the [[Denisovan|Denisovan hominin]], an [[extinct]] [[species]] of [[human]] in the genus [[Homo]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20151116"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=In a Tooth, DNA From Some Very Old Cousins, the Denisovans |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/17/science/in-a-tooth-dna-from-some-very-old-cousins-the-denisovans.html |date=16 November 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=16 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS-20151111"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sawyer |first1=Susanna |last2=Renaud |first2=Gabriel |last3=Viola |first3=Bence |last4=Hublin

The research has added new complexity to the peopling of Eurasia. It has also revealed new information about links between the ancestors of Central Asians and the indigenous peoples of the Americas. In Africa, older DNA degrades quickly due to the warmer tropical climate, although, in September 2017, ancient DNA samples, as old as 8,100 years old, have been reported.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170921"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=Clues to Africa’s Mysterious Past Found in Ancient Skeletons |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/science/africa-dna-migration.html |date=21 September 2017|work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=21 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plan Rome - Arcus Novus.png|thumb|Location of Arcus Novus]]
The '''Arcus Novus''' was an ancient arch in Rome, located on the ''[[Via Lata (Rome)|Via lata]]'' (now the Via del Corso ), at the site of the church of [[Santa Maria in Via Lata]].

== History ==
The arch was dedicated to [[Diocletian]] either for the occasion of his ''[[decennalia]]'' in 293&amp;nbsp;AD, or his [[Roman Triumph|triumph]] celebrated with [[Maximian]] in 303–304. The name Arcus novus (new arch) probably refers to the earlier [[Arch of Claudius (British victory)|Arch of Claudius]] on the same street.{{sfn|Richardson|1992|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=K_qjo30tjHAC&amp;pg=PA27 p.&amp;nbsp;27]}}

== Description ==
The Arcus Novus was decorated with reliefs reused (''[[spolia]]'') from a large altar of the Julio-Claudian period, most probably the ''Ara pietatis'', while the column [[plinths]] were decorated with images of ''[[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]]'', barbarian prisoners and the [[Dioskouri]], probably from the facade of the nearby [[Sol invictus|Temple of the Sun]] of [[Aurelian]]. The arch was destroyed in 1491 by order of Pope [[Innocent VIII]] during reconstruction of Santa Maria in Via Lata.{{sfn|Richardson|1992|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=K_qjo30tjHAC&amp;pg=PA27 p.&amp;nbsp;27]}}

Fragments of the reliefs were discovered in 1523 and added to the [[Andrea della Valle|Della Valle]] collection before being acquired by [[Cardinal Ferdinand de' Medici]] in 1584, from where the plinths found their way to the [[Boboli Gardens]] in Florence. Other fragments from the [[Antonine]] period, reused by [[Diocletian]], were included in the rear facade of the cardinal's [[Villa Medici]] in Rome. More recently excavations carried out in 1923–1933 discovered further fragments now in the [[Capitoline Museums#Centrale_Montemartini|Centrale Montemartini]].{{sfn|Richardson|1992|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=K_qjo30tjHAC&amp;pg=PA27 p.&amp;nbsp;27]}}

'''Assyriology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ἀσσυρίᾱ}}, ''Assyriā''; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is the archaeological, historical, and linguistic study of not just [[Assyria]], but the entirety of ancient [[Mesopotamia]] (a region encompassing what is today modern [[Iraq]], north eastern [[Syria]], south eastern [[Turkey]], and north western and south western [[Iran]]) and of related cultures that used [[Cuneiform|cuneiform writing]]. The field covers [[Sumer]], the early [[Sumero-Akkadian]] city-states, the [[Akkadian Empire]], [[Ebla]], the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and [[Imperial Aramaic]] speaking states of [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]] and the [[Sealand Dynasty]], the [[Emigration|migrant]] foreign dynasties of southern Mesopotamia, including; the [[Gutians]], [[Amorites]], [[Kassites]], [[Arameans]], [[Suteans]] and [[Chaldea]]ns, and to some degree post-imperial [[Achaemenid Assyria]], [[Athura]], [[Seleucid Syria]], [[Assyria (Roman province)]], and [[Assuristan]], together with later [[Neo-Assyrian]] states such as [[Adiabene]], [[Osroene]], [[Hatra]], [[Beth Nuhadra]] and [[Beth Garmai]], up until the [[Arab people|Arab]] invasion and [[Islamic conquest]] of the mid 7th century AD. Some Assyriologists also write on the further [[Assyrian continuity]] of the [[Assyrian people]] as well as the [[Mandaeans]] into the present day.

The large number of cuneiform clay tablets preserved by these [[Sumero-Akkadian]] and [[Assyro-Babylonian]] cultures provide an extremely large resource for the study of the period. The region's (and indeed the world's) first cities and city-states such as [[Ur]] are archaeologically invaluable for studying the growth of urbanization.

Scholars need a good knowledge of several languages: The two main languages of Mesopotamia; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (including its major dialects) and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], together with such neighbouring languages as [[Biblical Hebrew]], [[Hittite language|Hittite]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], [[Indo-Anatolian]], [[Imperial Aramaic]], [[Eastern Aramaic]] dialects, [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] and [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] for comparative purposes, and the knowledge of writing systems that use several hundred core signs. There now exist many important grammatical studies and lexical aids. Although scholars can draw from a large corpus of literature, some tablets are broken, or in the case of literary texts where there may be many copies, the language and grammar are often arcane. Moreover, scholars must be able to read and understand modern English, French, and German, as important references, dictionaries, and journals are published in those languages.

==History==

===From classical antiquity to modern excavation===
For many centuries, European knowledge of Mesopotamia was largely confined to often dubious [[Mesopotamia in Classical literature|classical sources]], as well as [[biblical]] writings. From the Middle Ages onward, there were scattered reports of ancient Mesopotamian ruins. As early as the 12th century, the ruins of Nineveh were correctly identified by [[Benjamin of Tudela]] (also known as Benjamin Son of Jonah), a rabbi from Navarre, who visited the Jews of Mosul and the ruins of Assyria during his travels throughout the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character, by Samule Noah Kramer, University of Chicago Press, 1963, p 7&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of the city of Babylon was made in 1616 by [[Pietro Della Valle]]. Not only did Pietro give "remarkable descriptions" of the site, but he also brought back to Europe inscribed bricks that he had found at Nineveh and Ur.&lt;ref&gt;The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character, by Samuel Noah Kramer, University of Chicago Press, 1963 p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century and birth===
Between 1761 and 1767, [[Carsten Niebuhr]], a [[Denmark|Danish]] mathematician, made copies of cuneiform inscriptions at [[Persepolis]] in [[Persia]] as well as sketches and drawing of Nineveh, and was shortly followed by [[André Michaux]], a French botanist and explorer, who sold the French Bibliothèque Nationale de Paris an inscribed boundary stone found near Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character, by Samuel Noah Kramer, University of Chicago Press, 1963, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The first known archeological excavation in Mesopotamia was led by [[Abbé Beauchamp]], papal vicar general at Baghdad, excavating the sculpture now generally known as the "Lion of Babylon."&lt;ref&gt;The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character, by Samuel Noah Kramer, University of Chicago Press, 1963. p 8&lt;/ref&gt; Abbé Beauchamp's memoirs of his travels, published in 1790, sparked a sensation in the scholarly world, generating a number of archeological and academic expeditions to the Middle East. In 1811, [[Claudius James Rich]], an Englishman and a resident for the East India Company in Baghdad, began examining and mapping the ruins of Babylon and Nineveh, and collecting numerous inscribed bricks, tablets, boundary stones, and cylinders, including the famous [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/c/cylinder_of_nebuchadnezzar_ii.aspx Nebuchadnezzar Cylinder] and Sennacherib Cylinder, a collection which formed the nucleus of the Mesopotamian antiquities collection at the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character, by Samuel Noah Kramer, University of Chicago Press, 1963 p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Before his untimely death at the age of 34, he wrote two memoirs on the ruins of Babylon and the inscriptions found therein, two works which may be said to "mark the birth of Assyriology  and the related cuneiform studies."&lt;ref&gt;The Sumerians: Their History, Culture and Character, by Samuel Noah Kramer, University of Chicago Press, 1963, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decipherment of cuneiform===

One of the largest obstacles scholars had to overcome during the early days of Assyriology was the decipherment of curious triangular markings on many of the artifacts and ruins found at Mesopotamian sites. These markings, which were termed "[[cuneiform]]" by [[Thomas Hyde]] in 1700, were long considered to be merely decorations and ornaments. It was not until late in the 18th century that they came to be considered some sort of writing.

In 1778 [[Carsten Niebuhr]], the Danish mathematician, published accurate copies of three trilingual inscriptions from the ruins at [[Persepolis]].&lt;ref&gt;The Sumerians: Their History, Culture and Character, by Samuel Noah Kramer, University of Chicago Press, 1963, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Niebuhr showed that the inscriptions were written from left to right, and that each of the three inscriptions contained three different types of cuneiform writing, which he labeled Class I, Class II, and Class III. 

Class I was determined to be alphabetic and consisting of 44 characters, and was written in Old Persian. It was first deciphered by [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]] and [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Creswicke Rawlinson]] between 1802 and 1848.&lt;ref&gt;The Sumerians: Their History, Culture and Character, by Samuel Noah Kramer, University of Chicago Press, 1963, p. 13–15&lt;/ref&gt;

The second inscription, Class II, proved more difficult to translate. In 1850, Edward Hincks published a paper showing that the Class II was not alphabetical, but was in fact both syllabic and ideographic, which led to its translation between 1850 and 1859. The language was at first called Babylonian and/or Assyrian, but has now come to be known as [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]].

From 1850 onwards, there was a growing suspicion that the Semite inhabitants of Babylon and Assyria were not the inventors of cuneiform system of writing, and that they had instead borrowed it from some other language and culture. In 1850, Edward Hincks published a paper suggesting that cuneiform was instead invented by some non-Semitic people who had preceded the Semites in Babylon. In 1853, Rawlinson came to similar conclusions, and the Class III inscriptions were recognized as being written in this more Ancient language, a language which was then called "Akkadian" or "Scythian" but which is now known to be [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. This was the first indication to modern scholarship that this older culture and people, the Sumerians, existed at all.

===Systematic excavation===
Systematic excavation of Mesopotamian antiquities was begun in earnest in 1842, with [[Paul-Émile Botta]], the French consul at Mosul. The excavations of [[P.E. Botta]] at Khorsabad and [[Austen Henry Layard|Austen H. Layard]] (from 1845) at Nimrud and [[Nineveh]], as well as the successful [[decipherment]] of the [[Cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]] system of writing opened up a new world. Layard's discovery of the library of [[Assur-bani-pal]] put the materials for reconstructing the ancient life and history of [[Assyria]] and [[Babylon]]ia into the hands of scholars. He also was the first to excavate in Babylonia, where [[C.J. Rich]] had already done useful topographical work. Layard's excavations in this latter country were continued by [[W.K. Loftus]], who also opened trenches at [[Susa]], as well as by [[Julius Oppert]] on behalf of the French government. But it was only in the last quarter of the 19th century that anything like systematic exploration was attempted.

After the death of [[George Smith (Assyriologist)|George Smith]] at [[Aleppo]] in 1876, an expedition was sent by the [[British Museum]] (1877–1879), under the conduct of [[Hormuzd Rassam]], to continue his work at Nineveh and its neighbourhood. Excavations in the mounds of Balaw~t, called [[Imgur-Bel]] by the Assyrians, 15 miles east of [[Mosul]], resulted in the discovery of a small temple dedicated to the god of dreams by [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883 BC), containing a stone [[coffer]] or ark in which were two inscribed tables of [[alabaster]] of rectangular shape, as well as of a palace which had been destroyed by the Babylonians but restored by [[Shalmaneser III]] (858 BC). From the latter came the bronze gates with hammered reliefs, which are now in the British Museum.

The remains of a palace of [[Ashurbanipal]] at [[Nimrud]] (Calah) were also excavated, and hundreds of enamelled tiles were disinterred. Two years later (1880–1881) Rassam was sent to Babylonia, where he discovered the site of the temple of the sun-god of [[Sippara]] at [[Abu-Habba]], and so fixed the position of the two Sipparas or Sepharvaim. Abu-Habba lies south-west of [[Baghdad]], midway between the [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]], on the south side of a canal, which may once have represented the main stream of the Euphrates, Sippara of the goddess Anunit, now Dir, being on its opposite bank.

Meanwhile (1877–1881) the French consul [[Ernest de Sarzec]] had been excavating at [[Girsu|Telloh]], ancient Girsu, and bringing to light monuments of the pre-Semitic age; these included the [[diorite]] [[statues of Gudea]] now in the [[Louvre]], the stone of which (according to the inscriptions upon them) had been brought from [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] in the [[Sinai peninsula]]. The subsequent excavations of de Sarzec in Telloh and its neighbourhood carried the history of the city back to at least 4000 BC, and a collection. of more than 30,000 tablets has been found, which were arranged on shelves in the time of Gudea (c. 2100 BC).

In 1886–1887 a German expedition under Dr [[Robert Koldewey]] explored the cemetery of El Hiba (immediately to the south of Telloh), and for the first time made us acquainted with the burial customs of ancient Babylonia. Another German expedition, on a large scale, was despatched by the ''Orientgesellschaft'' in 1899 with the object of exploring the ruins of Babylon; the palace of [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadrezzar]] and the great processional road were laid bare, and Dr W. Andrae subsequently conducted excavations at Qal'at Sherqat, the site of [[Assur]].

Even the Turkish government has not held aloof from the work of exploration, and the Museum at [[İstanbul]] is filled with the tablets discovered by [[V. Scheil]] in 1897 on the site of Sippara. [[Jacques de Morgan]]'s exceptionally important work at [[Susa]] lies outside the limits of Babylonia; not so, however, the American excavations (1903–1904) under EJ Banks at [[Bismaya]] (Ijdab), and those of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] at [[Nippur]] between 1889 and 1900, where Mr JH Haynes has systematically and patiently uncovered the remains of the great temple of [[Enlil|El-lil]], removing layer after layer of debris and cutting sections in the ruins down to the virgin soil. Midway in the mound is a platform of large bricks stamped with the names of [[Sargon of Akkad]] and his son, Naram-Sin (2300 BC); as the debris above them is 34 feet thick, the topmost stratum being not later than the [[Parthia]]n era (HV Hilprecht, ''The Babylonian Expedition'', p.&amp;nbsp;23), it is calculated that the debris underneath the pavement, 30 feet thick, must represent a period of about 3000 years, more especially as older constructions had to be leveled before the pavement was laid. In the deepest part of the excavations, however, inscribed clay tablets and fragments of stone vases are still found, though the cuneiform characters upon them are of a very archaic type, and sometimes even retain their primitive pictorial forms.

The '''Bollingen Foundation''' was an educational foundation set up along the lines of a university press in 1945. It was named for [[Bollingen Tower]], [[Carl Jung|Carl Jung's]] country home in [[Bollingen, Switzerland]]. Funding was provided by [[Paul Mellon]] and his wife [[Mary Conover Mellon]]. The Foundation became inactive in 1968.

==History==
Initially the foundation was dedicated to the dissemination of Jung's work, which was a particular interest of [[Mary Conover Mellon]].&lt;ref name="McGuire82"&gt;McGuire, William (1982). ''Bollingen: An Adventure in Collecting the Past'' (Princeton University Press:Bollingen Series, New Jersey).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bender"&gt;Bender, Thomas (1982). [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/14/books/with-love-and-money.html "With Love and Money,"] review of ''Bollingen: An Adventure in Collecting the Past'' in ''The New York Times'' November 14, 1982. Online version retrieved November 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bollingen Series of books that it sponsored now includes more than 250 related volumes.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;[http://press.princeton.edu/catalogs/series/bs.html "Bollingen Series (General),"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119143111/http://press.princeton.edu/catalogs/series/bs.html |date=November 19, 2007 }} webpage maintained by Princeton University Press. Retrieved November 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bollingen Foundation also awarded more than 300 fellowships.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, pp. 311-328. McGuire gives a complete, alphabetical list of the Fellows including the year of the Fellowship and a condensed description of the project.&lt;/ref&gt;  These fellowships were an important, continuing source of funding for poets like [[Alexis Leger]] and [[Marianne Moore]], scientists like [[Károly Kerényi]] and Mircea Eliade artists like [[Isamu Noguchi]], among many others.&lt;ref name="McGuire82" /&gt; The Foundation also sponsored the [[A. W. Mellon lectures]] at the [[National Gallery of Art]].

In 1948, the foundation donated $10,000 to the [[Library of Congress]] to be used toward a $1,000 [[Bollingen Prize]] for the best poetry each year.  The Library of Congress fellows, who in that year included [[T. S. Eliot]], [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Conrad Aiken]], gave the 1949 prize to [[Ezra Pound]] for his 1948 ''[[Pisan Cantos]]''.&lt;ref name="Beinecke"&gt;[http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/bollingen/ "The Bollingen Prize for Poetry at Yale,"] webpage maintained by Yale University. Retrieved Nov. 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Their choice was highly controversial, in particular because of Pound's fascist and anti-Semitic politics. Following the publication of two highly negative articles by [[Robert Hillyer]] in the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review of Literature]]'', the United States Congress passed a resolution that effectively discontinued the involvement of the Library of Congress with the prize. The remaining funds were returned to the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, William (1988). [http://writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/pound-bollingen.html "Ezra Pound and Bollingen Prize controversy,"] in ''Poetry's Catbird Seat (the consultantship in poetry in the English language at the Library of Congress, 1937-1987)'' (Library of Congress, Washington, D. C.). {{ISBN|0-8444-0586-8}} . Online version retrieved November 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the [[Bollingen Prize]] was continued under the auspices of the [[Yale University]] Library, which awarded the 1950 prize to [[Wallace Stevens]].

In 1968, the Foundation became inactive. It was largely subsumed into the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], which continued funding of the Bollingen Prize. The Bollingen Series was given to [[Princeton University Press]] to carry on and complete. Over its lifetime, the Bollingen Foundation had expended about $20 million. Thomas Bender has written,&lt;ref name="Bender" /&gt; {{quote|When Paul Mellon decided in 1963 to dissolve the Bollingen Foundation, he said that the founding generation was reaching the age of retirement, and it would be hard for others to maintain the original mission and standards. What he might have said was that the Bollingen Foundation was the work of a single generation. For two decades its concerns had been at the center of Western intellectual life, but the 1960's saw a shift in the cultural preoccupations and critical concerns of intellect in the United States and Europe.}}

==Bollingen Series==
A great many texts that were issued in the original Pantheon Books version of the Bollingen Series and in early editions by Princeton University Press are now out of print.  The Princeton Press site does not provide a comprehensive list, and is missing some of the key texts in the series and some of the grandest in vision, ''e.g.'' The Egyptian Religious Texts series.  A list of the works in the series, complete to 1982, appears as an appendix to William McGuire's book, pp.&amp;nbsp;295–309. The list below is based on McGuire's list and information appearing in the individual volumes, with help from the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130420162204/http://press.princeton.edu/catalogs/series/bs.html Princeton site] and from [http://catalog.loc.gov/index.html The Library Congress Online Catalog].

{{calendar|lk=on|show_year=on|float=right|month=current}}

A '''calendar''' is a system of organizing days for social, religious, commercial or administrative purposes. This is done by giving names to periods of [[time]], typically [[day]]s, [[week]]s, [[month]]s and [[year]]s. A [[calendar date|date]] is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system. A calendar is also a physical record (often paper) of such a system. A calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a [[court calendar]] or a partly or fully chronological list of documents, such as a calendar of wills.

Periods in a calendar (such as years and months) are usually, though not necessarily, synchronised with the cycle of the [[solar calendar|sun]] or the [[lunar calendar|moon]]. The most common type of pre-modern calendar was the [[lunisolar calendar]], a lunar calendar that occasionally adds one [[intercalary month]] to remain synchronised with the [[solar year]] over the long term.

The term ''calendar'' is taken from ''[[calends|calendae]]'', the term for the first day of the month in the Roman calendar, related to the verb ''calare'' "to call out", referring to the "calling" of the new moon when it was first seen.&lt;ref&gt;''New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;
Latin ''calendarium'' meant "account book, register" (as accounts were settled and debts were collected on the calends of each month). The Latin term was adopted in [[Old French]] as ''calendier'' and from there in [[Middle English]] as ''calender'' by the 13th century (the spelling ''calendar'' is early modern).

[[File:Equinozio da Pizzo Vento,tramonto fondachelli fantina, sicilia.JPG|thumb|[[Equinox]] seen from the astronomic calendar of Pizzo Vento at [[Fondachelli-Fantina|Fondachelli Fantina]], [[Sicily]]]]

The course of the sun and the moon are the most salient natural, regularly recurring events useful for [[timekeeping]], thus in pre-modern societies worldwide [[lunation]] and the [[year]] were most commonly used as time units. Nevertheless, the Roman calendar contained remnants of a very ancient pre-Etruscan 10-month solar year.&lt;ref&gt;"Religion in the Etruscan period" in [http://global.britannica.com/topic/Roman-religion Roman religion] in Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded physical calendars, dependent on the development of [[Bronze Age writing|writing]] in the [[Ancient Near East]], are the [[Bronze Age]] [[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian]] and [[Sumerian calendar|Sumerian]] calendars.&lt;ref&gt;citation needed&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of Ancient Near East calendar systems based on the [[Babylonian calendar]] date from the [[Iron Age]], among them the calendar system of the Persian Empire, which in turn gave rise to the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] and the [[Hebrew calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;citation needed&lt;/ref&gt;

A great number of [[Hellenic calendars]] developed in [[Classical Greece]], and in the [[Hellenistic period]] gave rise to both the  ancient [[Roman calendar]] and to various [[Hindu calendars]].&lt;ref&gt;citation needed&lt;/ref&gt;

Calendars in antiquity were [[lunisolar]], depending on the introduction of [[intercalary month]]s to align the solar and the lunar years. This was mostly based on observation, but there may have been early attempts to model the pattern of intercalation algorithmically, as evidenced in the fragmentary 2nd-century [[Coligny calendar]].

The [[Roman calendar]] was reformed by [[Julius Caesar]] in 45 BC. The Julian calendar was no longer dependent on the observation of the new moon but simply followed an algorithm of introducing a leap day every four years. This created a dissociation of the calendar [[month]] from the [[lunation]].

The [[Islamic calendar]] is based on the prohibition of intercalation (''[[nasi']]'') by [[Muhammad]], in Islamic tradition dated to a sermon held on  9 [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] AH 10 (Julian date: 6 March 632). This resulted in an observation-based lunar calendar that shifts relative to the seasons of the solar year.

=== Modern reforms ===
{{Main|Calendar reform}}

The first calendar reform of the early modern era was the [[Gregorian calendar]], introduced in 1582 based on the observation of a long-term shift between the Julian calendar and the solar year.

There have been a number of modern proposals for reform of the calendar, such as the [[World Calendar]], [[International Fixed Calendar]], [[Holocene calendar]], and, recently, the [[Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar]]. Such ideas are mooted from time to time but have failed to gain traction because of the loss of continuity, massive upheaval in implementation, and religious objections.

== Calendar systems ==
A full calendar system has a different calendar date for every day. Thus the week cycle is by itself not a full calendar system; neither is a system to name the days within a year without a system for identifying the years.

The simplest calendar system just counts time periods from a reference date. This applies for the [[Julian day]] or [[Unix Time]]. Virtually the only possible variation is using a different reference date, in particular, one less distant in the past to make the numbers smaller. Computations in these systems are just a matter of addition and subtraction.

Other calendars have one (or multiple) larger units of time.

Calendars that contain one level of cycles:
* week and weekday&amp;nbsp;– this system (without year, the week number keeps on increasing) is not very common
* year and ordinal date within the year, e.g., the [[ISO 8601#Ordinal dates|ISO 8601 ordinal date system]]

Calendars with two levels of cycles:
* year, month, and day&amp;nbsp;– most systems, including the [[Gregorian calendar]] (and its very similar predecessor, the [[Julian calendar]]), the [[Islamic calendar]], the [[Solar Hijri calendar]] and the [[Hebrew calendar]]
* year, week, and weekday&amp;nbsp;– e.g., the [[ISO week date]]

Cycles can be synchronized with periodic phenomena:
[[File:Sun and Moon Nuremberg chronicle.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|[[Sun]] and [[Moon]], Schedel's Nuremberg Chronicle, 1493]]
* [[Lunar calendar]]s are synchronized to the motion of the Moon ([[lunar phase]]s); an example is the Islamic calendar.
* [[Solar calendar]]s are based on perceived [[seasonal year|seasonal]] changes synchronized to the apparent motion of the Sun; an example is the [[Persian calendar]].
* [[Lunisolar calendar]]s are based on a combination of both solar and lunar reckonings; examples include the [[Chinese calendar|traditional calendar of China]], the [[Hindu calendar]] in India, and the Hebrew calendar.
* The week cycle is an example of one that is not synchronized to any external phenomenon (although it may have been derived from lunar phases, beginning anew every month).

Very commonly a calendar includes more than one type of cycle, or has both cyclic and non-cyclic elements.

Most calendars incorporate more complex cycles.   For example, the vast majority of them track years, months, weeks and days.   The  seven-day week is practically universal, though its use varies. It has run uninterrupted for millennia.{{sfn|Zerubavel | 1985}}

===Solar calendars===
{{main|Solar calendar}}

Solar calendars assign a ''date'' to each [[solar time|solar day]]. A day may consist of the period between [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]], with a following period of [[night]], or it may be a period between successive events such as two sunsets. The length of the interval between two such successive events may be allowed to vary slightly during the year, or it may be averaged into a [[solar time|mean solar day]]. Other types of calendar may also use a solar day.

===Lunar calendars===
{{Main|Lunar calendar}}
Not all calendars use the solar year as a unit. A lunar calendar is one in which days are numbered within each [[lunar phase]] cycle.  Because the length of the [[lunar month]] is not an even fraction of the length of the [[tropical year]], a purely lunar calendar quickly drifts against the seasons, which do not vary much near the equator.  It does, however, stay constant with respect to other phenomena, notably [[tide]]s. An example is the [[Islamic calendar]].
Alexander Marshack, in a controversial reading,&lt;ref&gt;James Elkins, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5Ku6YdWurMgC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63 Our beautiful, dry, and distant texts]'' (1998) 63ff.&lt;/ref&gt; believed that marks on a bone baton (c. 25,000 BC) represented a lunar calendar. Other marked bones may also represent lunar calendars. Similarly, Michael Rappenglueck believes that marks on a 15,000-year-old cave painting represent a lunar calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/975360.stm |title=Oldest lunar calendar identified |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-10-16 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lunisolar calendars===
A [[lunisolar calendar]] is a lunar calendar that compensates by adding an extra month as needed to realign the months with the seasons. An example is the Hebrew calendar which uses a [[metonic cycle|19-year cycle]].

==Calendar subdivisions==
{{see also|Decade|Century|Millennium}}

Nearly all calendar systems group consecutive days into "months" and also into "years". In a ''solar calendar'' a ''year'' approximates Earth's tropical year (that is, the time it takes for a complete cycle of [[season]]s), traditionally used to facilitate the planning of [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities. In a ''lunar calendar'', the ''month'' approximates the cycle of the moon phase. Consecutive days may be grouped into other periods such as the week.

Because the number of days in the ''tropical year'' is not a whole number, a solar calendar must have a different number of days in different years. This may be handled, for example, by adding an extra day in [[leap year]]s. The same applies to months in a lunar calendar and also the number of months in a year in a lunisolar calendar. This is generally known as [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]]. Even if a calendar is solar, but not lunar, the year cannot be divided entirely into months that never vary in length.

Cultures may define other units of time, such as the week, for the purpose of scheduling regular activities that do not easily coincide with months or years. Many cultures use different baselines for their calendars' starting years. For example, the year in [[Japan]] is based on the reign of the current emperor: 2006 was Year 18 of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Akihito]].

==Other calendar types==

===Arithmetic and astronomical calendars===
[[File:JudischerKalender-1831 ubt.jpeg|thumb|Calendar of the [[Qahal]], 5591 (1831)]]

An ''astronomical calendar'' is based on ongoing observation; examples are the religious Islamic calendar and the old religious Jewish calendar in the time of the [[Second Temple]]. Such a calendar is also referred to as an ''observation-based'' calendar. The advantage of such a calendar is that it is perfectly and perpetually accurate. The disadvantage is that working out when a particular date would occur is difficult.

An ''arithmetic calendar'' is one that is based on a strict set of rules; an example is the current Jewish calendar. Such a calendar is also referred to as a ''rule-based'' calendar. The advantage of such a calendar is the ease of calculating when a particular date occurs. The disadvantage is imperfect accuracy. Furthermore, even if the calendar is very accurate, its accuracy diminishes slowly over time, owing to changes in Earth's rotation. This limits the lifetime of an accurate arithmetic calendar to a few thousand years. After then, the rules would need to be modified from observations made since the invention of the calendar.

===Complete and incomplete calendars===
{{Disputed section|date=June 2017}}
Calendars may be either complete or incomplete. Complete calendars provide a way of naming each consecutive day, while incomplete calendars do not. The early [[Roman calendar]], which had no way of designating the days of the winter months other than to lump them together as "winter", is an example of an incomplete calendar, while the Gregorian calendar is an example of a complete calendar.

==Calendars in use==

The primary practical use of a calendar is to identify days: to be informed about or to agree on a future event and to record an event that has happened. Days may be significant for agricultural, civil, religious or social reasons. For example, a calendar provides a way to determine when to start planting or harvesting, which days are [[religious holiday|religious]] or [[civil holiday]]s, which days mark the beginning and end of business accounting periods, and which days have legal significance, such as the day taxes are due or a contract expires. Also a calendar may, by identifying a day, provide other useful information about the day such as its season.

Calendars are also used to help people manage their personal schedules, time and activities, particularly when individuals have numerous work, school, and family commitments. People frequently use multiple systems, and may keep both a [[business]] and [[family]] calendar to help prevent them from overcommitting their time.

Calendars are also used as part of a complete [[timekeeping]] system: date and time of day together specify a moment in [[time]].  In the modern world, timekeepers can show time, date and weekday. Some may also show lunar phase.

===Gregorian calendar===
The [[Gregorian calendar]] is the ''[[de facto]]'' international standard, and is used almost everywhere in the world for civil purposes. It is a purely solar calendar, with a cycle of leap days in a 400-year cycle designed to keep the duration of the year aligned with the [[solar year]].

Each Gregorian year has either 365 or 366 days (the leap day being inserted as 29 February), amounting to an average Gregorian year of  365.2425 days (compared to a solar year of 365.2422 days). It was introduced in 1582 as a refinement to the [[Julian calendar]] which had been in use throughout the European Middle Ages, amounting to a 0.002% correction in the length of the year.

During the Early Modern period, however, [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar|its adoption was mostly limited]] to [[Roman Catholic]] nations, but by the 19th century, it became widely adopted worldwide for the sake of convenience in international trade. The last European country to adopt the reform was Greece, in 1923.

The [[calendar epoch]] used by the Gregorian calendar is inherited from the medieval convention established by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] and associated with the Julian calendar. The year number is variously given as AD (for ''[[Anno Domini]]'') or CE (for ''[[Common Era]]'' or, indeed, ''Christian Era'').

===Religious calendars===

[[File:Hindu calendar 1871-72.jpg|thumb|A Hindu [[almanac]] (''pancanga'') for the year 1871/2 from [[Rajasthan]] (Library of Congress, Asian Division)]]
The most important use of pre-modern calendars is keeping track of the [[liturgical year]] and the observation of religious feast days.

While the Gregorian calendar is itself historically motivated in relation to the calculation of the [[Easter date]], it is now in worldwide secular use as the ''de facto'' standard. Alongside the use of the Gregorian calendar for secular matters, there remain a number of calendars in use for religious purposes.

[[Eastern Christians]], including the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]], use the [[Julian calendar]].

The [[Islamic calendar]]  or Hijri calendar, is a [[lunar calendar]] consisting of 12 lunar months in a year of 354 or 355 days. It is used to date events in most of the Muslim countries (concurrently with the Gregorian calendar), and used by Muslims everywhere to determine the proper day on which to celebrate Islamic holy days and festivals. Its epoch is the [[Anno Hegirae|Hijra]] (corresponding to AD 622)
With an annual drift of 11 or 12 days, the seasonal relation is repeated approximately each 33 Islamic years.

Various [[Hindu calendar]]s remain in use in the Indian subcontinent, including the [[Nepali calendar]], [[Bengali calendar]], [[Malayalam calendar]], [[Tamil calendar]], [[Vikrama Samvat]] used in Northern India, and [[Shalivahana era|Shalivahana]] calendar in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] states.

The [[Buddhist calendar]] and the traditional lunisolar calendars of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Thailand]] are also based on an older version of the Hindu calendar.

Most of the Hindu calendars are inherited from a system first enunciated in [[Vedanga Jyotisha]] of Lagadha,  standardized in the ''[[Surya Siddhanta|Sūrya Siddhānta]]'' and subsequently reformed by astronomers such as [[Aryabhata|Āryabhaṭa]] (AD 499), [[Varahamihira|Varāhamihira]] (6th century) and [[Bhāskara II]] (12th century).

The [[Hebrew calendar]] is used by [[Jews]] worldwide for religious and cultural affairs, also influences civil matters in Israel (such as [[public holiday|national holidays]]) and can be used there for business dealings (such as for the dating of [[cheque]]s).

[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] worldwide use the [[Bahá'í calendar]].

===National calendars===
The [[Chinese calendar|Chinese]], [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew]], [[Hindu calendar|Hindu]], and [[Julian calendar|Julian]] calendars are widely used for religious and social purposes.

The [[Iranian calendar|Iranian (Persian) calendar]] is used in [[Iran]] and some parts of [[Afghanistan]]. The [[Ethiopian calendar]] or Ethiopic calendar is the principal calendar used in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]], with the [[Oromo calendar]] also in use in some areas. In neighboring [[Somalia]], the [[Somali calendar]] co-exists alongside the Gregorian and Islamic calendars. In [[Thailand]], where the [[Thai solar calendar]] is used, the months and days have adopted the western standard, although the years are still based on the traditional [[Buddhist calendar]].

===Fiscal calendars===
{{Main|Fiscal calendar}}
[[File:Pieter Brueghel the Younger (or workshop) The Payment of the Tithes Bonhams.jpg|thumb|''The Payment of the Tithes'' (The tax-collector), also known as ''Village Lawyer'', by [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]] or workshop]]

A fiscal calendar generally means the accounting year of a government or a business. It is used for budgeting, keeping accounts and taxation. It is a set of 12 months that may start at any date in a year. The US government's fiscal year starts on 1 October and ends on 30 September. The government of India's fiscal year starts on 1 April and ends on 31 March. Small traditional businesses in India start the fiscal year on [[Diwali]] festival and end the day before the next year's Diwali festival.

In accounting (and particularly accounting software), a fiscal calendar (such as a [[4-4-5 Calendar|4/4/5 calendar]]) fixes each month at a specific number of weeks to facilitate comparisons from month to month and year to year. January always has exactly 4 weeks (Sunday through Saturday), February has 4 weeks, March has 5 weeks, etc. Note that this calendar will normally need to add a 53rd week to every 5th or 6th year, which might be added to December or might not be, depending on how the organization uses those dates. There exists an international standard way to do this (the [[ISO 8601|ISO week]]). The ISO week starts on a Monday, and ends on a Sunday. Week 1 is always the week that contains 4 January in the Gregorian calendar.

==Formats==
[[File:Petaluma and Santa Rosa Railroad Co. Calendar.jpg|thumb|A calendar from the Petaluma and Santa Rosa Railroad]]

The term ''calendar'' applies not only to a given scheme of timekeeping but also to a specific record or device displaying such a scheme, for example an [[appointment book]] in the form of a pocket calendar (or [[personal organizer]]), desktop calendar, a [[wall calendar]], etc.

In a paper calendar one or two sheets can show a single day, a week, a month, or a year. If a sheet is for a single day, it easily shows the date and the weekday. If a sheet is for multiple days it shows a conversion table to convert from weekday to date and back. With a special pointing device, or by crossing out past days, it may indicate the current date and weekday. This is the most common usage of the word.

In the US Sunday is considered the first day of the week and so appears on the far left and Saturday the last day of the week appearing on the far right. In Britain the weekend may appear at the end of the week so the first day is Monday and the last day is Sunday. The US calendar display is also used in Britain.

It is common to display the Gregorian calendar in separate monthly grids of seven columns (from Monday to Sunday, or Sunday to Saturday depending on which day is considered to start the week&amp;nbsp;– this varies according to country) and five to six rows (or rarely, four rows when the month of February contains 28 days beginning on the first day of the week), with the day of the month numbered in each cell, beginning with 1.   The sixth row is sometimes eliminated by marking 23/30 and 24/31 together as necessary.

When working with weeks rather than months, a continuous format is sometimes more convenient, where no blank cells are inserted to ensure that the first day of a new month begins on a fresh row.

===Calendaring software===
{{Main|Calendaring software}}
{{Further|:Category:Calendaring standards}}

Calendaring software provides users with an electronic version of a calendar, and may additionally provide an appointment book, address book or contact list.
Calendaring is a standard feature of many [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], [[Enterprise digital assistant|EDAs]], and [[smartphones]]. The software may be a local package designed for individual use (e.g., [[Lightning (software)|Lightning]] extension for [[Mozilla Thunderbird]], [[Microsoft Outlook]] without Exchange Server, or [[Windows Calendar]]) or may be a networked package that allows for the sharing of information between users (e.g., [[Mozilla Sunbird]], [[Windows Live Calendar]], [[Google Calendar]], or [[Microsoft Outlook]] with Exchange Server).

'''Cangjie''' ({{zh|t=倉頡}}) is a legendary figure in ancient [[China]] (c. 2650 BCE), claimed to be an official historian of the [[Yellow Emperor]] and the inventor of [[Chinese character]]s.&lt;ref name="chinese printing history"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zhang |first=Shudong |title=《中华印刷通史》 |trans-title=A General History of Chinese Printing |language=Chinese |publisher=XingCai Literary Foundation |year=2005 |location=Taipei |pages=ch.3, sec.1 |url=http://www.cgan.net/book/books/print/g-history/big5_12/03_1.htm#031 |isbn=957-99638-3-5}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Legend has it that he had four eyes, and that when he invented the characters, the deities and ghosts cried and the sky rained [[millet]]. He is considered a legendary rather than historical figure, or at least, not considered to be sole inventor of Chinese characters. Cangjie was the [[eponym]] for the (c. 220 BCE) ''[[Cangjiepian]]'' proto-dictionary, the [[Cangjie method]] of [[Chinese input methods for computers|inputting characters into a computer]], and a [[Mars|Martian]] rock visited by the Mars rover [[Spirit rover|Spirit]], and named by the rover team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=為火星目標地中文命名 王阿蓮博士為世界華人爭得殊榮 |trans-title=Mars destinations given Chinese names, Dr. Wang gets honor for all Chinese people |language=Chinese |publisher=聖路易時報 (St. Louis Chinese American News) |date=2006-02-23 |url=http://www.scanews.com/2006/02/s809/80902/ |accessdate=2008-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend of character creation==
[[Image:Ts'ang-Chieh-Lawrie-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|upright|Bronze relief of Cangjie by [[Lee Lawrie]], 1939, at the [[Library of Congress]]'s [[John Adams Building]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
There are several versions of the legend. One tells that shortly after unifying China, the Yellow Emperor, being dissatisfied with his "rope knot tying" method (i.e., [[Quipu#China|Quipu]]) of recording information, charged Cangjie with the task of creating characters for writing. Cangjie then settled down on the bank of a river, and devoted himself to the completion of the task at hand. Even after devoting much time and effort, however, he was unable to create even one character. One day, Cangjie suddenly saw a phoenix flying in the sky above, carrying an object in its beak. The object fell to the ground directly in front of Cangjie, and he saw it to be an impression of a hoof-print. Not being able to recognize which animal the print belonged to, he asked for the help of a local hunter passing by on the road. The hunter told him that this was, without a doubt, the hoof print of a [[Pixiu]], being different from the hoof-print of any other beast that was alive. His conversation with the hunter greatly inspired Cangjie, leading him to believe that if he could capture in a drawing the special characteristics that set apart each and every thing on the earth, this would truly be the perfect kind of character for writing. From that day forward, Cangjie paid close attention to the characteristics of all things, including the sun, moon, stars, clouds, lakes, oceans, as well as all manner of bird and beast. He began to create characters according to the special characteristics he found, and before long, had compiled a long list of characters for writing. To the delight of the Yellow Emperor, Cangjie presented him with the complete set of characters. The emperor then called the premiers of each of the nine provinces together in order for Cangjie to teach them this new writing system. Monuments and temples were erected in Cangjie's honor on the bank of the river where he created these characters.&lt;ref name="chinese printing history"/&gt;

Another version of the legend tells that Cangjie was inspired by observing the network of veins on a turtle. This version is particularly interesting relative to archaeology because turtle shells are one of the most common media on which the earliest known Chinese inscriptions are found, including the [[Jiahu symbols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Monro|first1=Alexander|title=The Paper Trail: An Unexpected History of a Revolutionary Invention|date=2016|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Remains and commemorations ==
There are tombs dedicated to Cangjie in the provinces of [[Shandong]], [[Henan]], [[Hebei]], and [[Shaanxi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9104">'''Constantine of Berat''', known among [[Albanians]] as '''Kostandin Jermonak Berati''' or shortly '''Kostë Berati''', was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] writer and translator of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;{{citation| url= https://books.google.com/?id=z-UcAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22kosta+berati%22&amp;dq=%22kosta+berati%22| page=268| title=Bulletin scientifique| volume=7 | publisher=Le Conseil | year=1971 | location=[[Zagreb]]| author=  Savet akademija nauka SFRJ| oclc=1765068 | issn=0350-1604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Not much is known about him, except that he was from [[Berat]], today's southern part of central [[Albania]], then [[Sanjak of Berat]] in [[Vilayet of Janina]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. His lifespan was highly probably between 1745 and 1825. Also, Constantine was quite likely an [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] monk. [[Robert Elsie|Elsie]] mentions that some experts doubt his existence, at least as a writer.&lt;ref name="Elsie"&gt;{{citation|author=[[Robert Elsie]]| url=http://www.albanianliterature.net/authors_early/berat.html| title=Costantine of Berat| publisher=Robert Elsie, part of "Albanian Literature in Translation"}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has copied a part of the "lexicon" of [[Theodore Kavalliotis]], and is believed to have signed in 1779 a religious document (in Greek) together with Kavallioti and [[Teodor Haxhifilipi]] in [[Moscopole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9_gXTda0HS8C&amp;pg=PA279&amp;lpg=PA279&amp;dq=kostandini+i+beratit#v=onepage&amp;q=kostandini%20i%20beratit&amp;f=false| author=Xhevat Lloshi| page=279| language=Albanian|title=Rreth alfabetit të shqipes: me rastin e 100-vjetorit të Kongresit të Manastirit| publisher=Logos-A| year=2008|isbn=9789989582684|oclc=494310096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine of Berat is attributed as the author of a manuscript from 1764 to 1822, originally a 154&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt; or 152-page work.&lt;ref name="Ermenji"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ermenji.org/historia/chap18.html| publisher=Komiteti Kombëtar Demokrat "Shqipnija ë Lirë"| location=Paris (printed in Rome)| oclc=504152562| chapter=XVIII|quote=I gjysmës së dytë të shekullit XVIII është edhe një dorëshkrim greqisht e shqip i Kostandin Beratit, prej nja 152 faqesh, ku pjesa shqipe përmban disa lutje fetare e copa t'Ungjillit, një vjershë hymnore mbi vuajtjet e Krishtit dhe një fjalor greqisht-shqip. Shkrimet e këtilla kishin për qëllim t'ua bënin fenë të kuptuarshme Shqiptarëvet orthodoks që s'e dinin greqishten, ose edhe t'iu lehtësonin mësimin e kësaj gjuhe. Por në dorëshkrimin gjindet edhe një tjetër abece, ku më të shumtat e shkronjavet iu shembëllejnë atyre t'abecesë glagolitike e cirilike sllave. Me këtë janë shkruar shqip vetëm dy radhë.&lt;br&gt;translated&lt;br /&gt;''Of the second half of the 18th century, there is a Greek-Albanian manuscript of Kostandin Berati, around 152 pages, where the Albanian part contains some religious prayers and Bible fragments, a hymn-poetry on Christ's suffering, and a Greek-Albanian dictionary. These kind of writings aimed at making the religion understandable to the Orthodox Albanians who did not know Greek, or facilitating them to learn Greek, But the manuscript contains another alphabet, where the majority of letters resemble the Glagolitic-Cyrilic slavic ones. This alphabet was used in only two verses'' |title=Vendi që zë Skënderbeu në historinë e Shqipërisë | author=Abaz Ermenji|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is preserved in the [[National Library of Albania|National Library in Tirana]].&lt;ref name="ata"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ata.gov.al/manastiri-i-shen-kozmaitmidis-legjendes-dhe-historise-96594.html| language=Albanian|quote=Një dëshmi me vlera për veprimtarinë arsimore të Kozmait është dorëshkrimi i murgut Kostandin Berati i cili gjendet sot në akivin e bibliotekës kombetare ne Tiranë.&lt;br&gt;translated&lt;br /&gt;''A valuable testimony of the educational activity of St. Kozma is the manuscript of the monk Kostandin Berati, which is preserved in the archives of the National Library in Tirana'' | title=Manastiri i "Shën Kozmait", midis legjendës dhe historisë|trans-title=Monastery of St.Kozma, between legend and history| publisher=Albanian Telegraphic Agency|date=2014-04-22|author=Nikolla Lena}}&lt;/ref&gt; This so-called [[Codex of Constantine of Berat]] or Codex of Berat (but not to be confused with [[Codex Beratinus|Codex Beratinus I]] and [[Codex Beratinus II|II]]), is a simple paper manuscript and must not be envisaged as an illuminated parchment codex in the Western tradition. The Albanian part of the manuscript contains some religious prayers and Bible fragments, a hymn-poetry on Christ's suffering, and a Greek-Albanian dictionary.&lt;ref name="Ermenji"/&gt; It was discovered by the Albanian researcher and [[Rilindas]] [[Ilo Mitkë Qafëzezi]] in 1938. In Qafëzezi's study "Protopapa Theodhor Nastas Kavalioti, Teacher of the  [[New Academy (Moscopole)|New Academy]] of [[Voskopojë]], 1718-1719" of 1951, he mentions that "as Albanian language perspective, in general, the work of Kosta (Berati) is bigger and superior from the [[Albanian language]] of all his contemporary writers". Albanian researcher [[Bedri Dedja]] considers Constantine's alphabet and writings as influential in the "New Academy" of Voskopojë, and is part of a wider cultural enlightenment of the Berat area. The codex seems to have been the work of at least two hands and was completed around 1798 at the earliest. It contains various and sundry texts in Greek and Albanian: biblical and Orthodox liturgical texts in Albanian written in the Greek alphabet, all of them no doubt translated from Greek or strongly influenced by Greek models. His alphabet contained 37 letters. Since the [[Greek script]] does not contain Albanian sounds [[ë]], [[List of Latin-script digraphs#N|nj]], [[Sh (digraph)|sh]], [[Zh (digraph)|zh]], etc, he used [[Diacritic|diacritic letters]]. I.e. the "ë" shows up as a rotated [[Latin script]] "i" or an "[[alpha]]" with a [[Iota subscript]], "nj" as "ni", etc. Among the texts in the Codex of Berat is a forty-four-line Albanian poem, with the corresponding Greek text, called "The Virgin Mary before the Cross" ({{lang-sq|Zonja Shën Mëri përpara kryqësë}}). It is written in so-called fifteen-syllable [[political verse]]. According to Elsie, the poem seems to be based on a Greek original by Akakios Diakrusis of [[Cephalonia]], published in 1730. Also, the manuscript contains valuable information on [[Cosmas of Aetolia]] and his journeys through Albania.&lt;ref name="ata"/&gt;

Constantine also compiled two Greek-Albanian glossaries comprising a total of 1,710 entries, most of Albanian words belong to the Berat dialect and are commonly used there. He also wrote a short passage containing another original Albanian alphabet which resembles the [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]]-[[Cyrillic script]]. Only two verses are written in this alphabet.&lt;ref name="Ermenji"/&gt; The rest of his work consists of various religious notes; and a chronicle of events between 1764 and 1789 written in Greek. The Orthodox communities of central and southern Albania used later some of the religious texts in this manuscript later circulated for teaching purposes.&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt;

Constantine's work and similar contemporary works of his time aimed at making the Orthodox religion as understandable as possible to the Orthodox Albanians who did not speak Greek, or/and facilitating them to learn the Greek language.&lt;ref name="Ermenji"/&gt; Due to its importance, the manuscript is top-listed to be digitized as part of the [[Albanological Portal]], a joint project of the Albanian and [[Kosovo]] National Libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.top-channel.tv/mobile/artikull.php?id=225324| publisher=Top-Channel| language=Albanian|year=2014|title=Perurohet portali albanologjik|quote=Në faqen e internetit janë vendosur dhe do të vendosen kopje dixhitale të disa prej veprave më të rëndësishme të historisë së kombit tonë, si Meshari i Gjon Buzukut, apo dorëshkrimi i Kostandin Beratit.&lt;br&gt;translated&lt;br /&gt;''On the internet page are placed and will be placed digitized copies of some of the most important works of our nation's history, such as Meshari of Gjon Buzuku and the manuscript of Kostandin Berati}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A street in Berat is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vendime.al/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Vendim-i-Keshillit-Bashkiak-Berat-nr51-dt-03.11.2011.pdf Disa plotesime dhe saktesime ne sistemin e adresave (Some additions and corrections in the address system - Municipality of Berat]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dmitri Mikhailovich Bondarenko''' ({{lang-rus|Дми́трий Миха́йлович Бондаре́нко|p=ˈdmʲitrʲɪj mʲɪˈxajləvʲɪt͡ɕ bənd̪ɐˈrʲeŋko|a=Ru-Dmitrii Mikhailovich Bondarenko.ogg}}; born 1968), is a Russian anthropologist, historian, and africanist. He has conducted field research in a number of African countries (particularly, [[Tanzania]], [[Nigeria]], [[Benin]], [[Rwanda]], [[Zambia]], [[Uganda]]) and among Black people in [[Russia]] and the [[United States]]. He is Principal Research Fellow and Vice-Director for Research with the Institute for African Studies of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], Director of the International Center of Anthropology of the [[National Research University Higher School of Economics]], and Full Professor in Ethnology with the Center of Social Anthropology of the [[Russian State University for the Humanities]]. He holds the titles of Professor in Ethnology from the Lomonosov Moscow State University, [[Professor of the Russian Academy of Sciences]] in Global Problems and International Relations, and Corresponding Member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in History.

Bondarenko was a visiting scholar with the Northwestern University ([[United States]]), Institut für Geschichte ([[Germany]]), and Maison des sciences de l'homme ([[France]]). He has delivered guest lectures at universities of [[Russia]], the [[United States]], [[Egypt]], [[Tanzania]],[[Slovenia]], [[Angola]], and [[Uganda]]. Bondarenko is a member of the Executive Committee of the Africanist Network of the "[[European Association of Social Anthropologists]]", for which he also served as the Committee Chairperson in 2006–2008. Dmitri Bondarenko is a co-founder and co-editor of "[[Social Evolution &amp; History]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/seh/ journal "Social Evolution &amp; History"]&lt;/ref&gt;".

== Education ==
Bondarenko graduated with the M.A. degree in 1990 from the [[Moscow State University]], Department of Ethnography, School of History. He completed his Ph.D. in 1993 at [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. He also holds Doctor of Sciences degree (2000) from the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

== Research interests and major contributions ==
Social theory, anthropological and historical theory, political anthropology, pre-industrial societies, cultures and history of Africa, socio-cultural transformations and intercultural interaction in contemporary world (including ethnic, racial, and religious aspects, migration issues) with special focus on Africa and people of African descent worldwide

Bondarenko has introduced (together with [[Andrey Korotayev]]) and started elaborating the notion of ''[[homoarchy]]'' to be coupled with the one of ''[[heterarchy]]'', noting that the heterarchy (defined as "the relation of elements to one another when they are unranked or when they possess the potential for being ranked in a number of different ways") is not the opposite of any hierarchy all together, but is rather the opposite of "homoarchy", defined as "the relation of elements to one another when they are rigidly ranked one way only, and thus possess no (or not more than very limited) potential for being unranked or ranked in another or a number of different ways at least without cardinal reshaping of the whole socio-political order".

Basing primarily on the precolonial [[Benin Kingdom]] evidence, Bondarenko has elaborated the conception of "megacommunity" as a specific type of the non-state supercomplex society, integration of a supercomplex (exceeding the complex chiefdom level) society on community (and hence non-state) basis being its main distinctive feature. He has contributed to the studies of the state origins and nature by dealing with such aspects of the problematics as the dynamics of kinship and territoriality as principles of socio-political organization, transformations in ideology, and others.

In publications on contemporary issues Bondarenko argues, in particular, that globalization should be viewed as a primarily cultural, not economic and political, phenomenon which is by no means a recently appeared one but which embraces essentially the whole human history, and which can turn out a "successful historical project" in the shape of a "federation of local civilizations" only.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2909">'''Edward Elias Atwater''' (May 28, 1816 – December 2, 1887) was an American minister and author.

Atwater, only surviving child of Elihu and Julia (Thompson) Atwater, was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], Conn., May 28, 1816.

He graduated from [[Yale College]] in 1836.  After graduation he taught for a year in a family in [[Oldham County, Kentucky]]. In 1837 he entered the [[Yale Divinity School]], and completed a three year course of study.

On November 24, 1841, he was ordained pastor of the Congregational Church in [[Ravenna, Ohio]], which office he resigned on July 1, 1849. He then spent a year in foreign travel, and on February 3, 1852, was installed over the Congregational Church in Salmon Falls, in the township of [[Rollinsford, New Hampshire|Rollinsford]], N. H. He was dismissed from this charge, November 3, 1857, when he returned to New Haven. A few months later he undertook a missionary enterprise in the eastern part of the city, which resulted after years of patient labor in the organization of a church (the Davenport Church) of which he was installed pastor on April 22, 1863.

He withdrew from this service on June 14, 1870, but continued to reside in New Haven, partly engaged in literary labors, until his death. In 1887 he went to Florida for the winter, and died there, in the town of [[Hawthorne, Florida|Hawthorn]], very suddenly, from a stroke of [[apoplexy]], on the 2nd of December, in his 72nd year.

He married, August 9, 1844, Rebecca H., daughter of Deacon David Dana, of [[Pomfret, Vermont]], who survived him. Their only child died in infancy.

He published in 1873 ''A genealogical register of the descendants in the male line of [[David Atwater]], one of the original planters of New Haven, Conn., to the sixth generation''. (64 pp 8vo), also in 1875 a ''History and Significance of the Sacred Tabernacle of the Hebrews'' (448 pp 8vo), and in 1881 a ''History of the Colony of New Haven'' (611 pp 8vo) The last named elaborate work determined the more serious undertaking which occupied three or four years of his later life,—the editing of a ''History of the City of New Haven'', which was published in 1887 (702 pp.&amp;nbsp;8vo), and to which he was himself the chief contributor.

'''''Foundations of Christianity''''' (German: '''''Der Ursprung des Christentums''''') is a 1908 book by [[Marxist]] theoretician [[Karl Kautsky]]. In it, he attempts to explain the origins of Christianity, and claims that it can best be explained by [[historical materialism]] rather than [[divinity]].

==Publishing history==
The first edition in English, published in 1925 by [[George Allen and Unwin]], followed the eleventh German version. The German text was re-translated into English by [[Henry F. Mins]], and published by [[Russell and Russell]] in 1953. In 1972, a translation by [[Jacob W. Hartmann]] was published by [[Monthly Review Press]]. The edition current in print was published by [[Socialist Resistance|Resistance]] in 2007 and contains a preface by [[Michael Lowy]].

==Summary==
In his foreword, Kautsky expressed his hope that the book would be 'a powerful weapon in the struggles of the present, in order to hasten the attainment of a better future'. He began his analysis by looking for evidence that 'the person of Jesus' existed at all, using [[pagan]] and Christian sources. The next dozen chapters are then taken up with a [[materialist]] description of the [[ancient Roman]] society from which early Christianity sprang. Kautsky then went on to describe the history of the [[Jewish]] people, up to the point where Christianity began.

Having set the scene, Kautsky described the beginnings of Christianity. The next five sections are called 'The Primitive Christian Community', 'The Christian Idea of the [[Messiah]]', 'Jewish Christians and [[Gentile]] Christians', 'The History of Christ’s [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]' and 'The Development of the Christian Community'.

Kautsky contended that Christianity was born out of a group of [[Jewish]] [[proletarians]] in a decaying [[Roman empire]], who sought to defeat the Romans through a violent insurrection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14728">{{History of literature by era}}

'''Greek literature''' dates from [[ancient Greek literature]], beginning in 800 BC, to the [[modern Greek literature]] of today. 

Ancient Greek literature was written in an Ancient Greek dialect. This literature ranges from the oldest surviving written works until works from approximately the fifth century AD. This time period is divided into the Preclassical, Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman periods. Preclassical Greek literature primarily revolved around myths and include the works of [[Homer]]; the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. The [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] period saw the dawn of drama and history. Three philosophers are especially notable: [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]]. During the Roman era, significant contributions were made in a variety of subjects, including history, philosophy, and the sciences.

Byzantine literature, the literature of the [[Byzantine Empire]], was written in [[Attic Greek|Atticizing]], [[Medieval Greek|Medieval]] and early [[Modern Greek]]. [[Chronicle]]s, distinct from historics, arose in this period. [[Encyclopedia]]s also flourished in this period.

Modern Greek literature is written in common [[Modern Greek]]. The [[Cretan Renaissance]] poem ''[[Erotokritos]]'' is one of the most significant works from this time period. [[Adamantios Korais]] and [[Rigas Feraios]] are two of the most notable figures.

==Ancient Greek literature (800 BC-350 AD)==
{{Main article|Ancient Greek literature}}

Ancient Greek literature refers to literature written in Ancient Greek dialects. These works range from the oldest surviving written works in the [[Greek language]] until works from the fifth century AD. The Greek language arose from the [[proto-Indo-European language]]; roughly two-thirds of its words can be derived from various reconstructions of the tongue. A number of [[alphabet]]s and [[Syllabary|syllabaries]] had been used to render Greek, but surviving Greek literature was written in a [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]]-derived alphabet that arose primarily in Greek [[Ionia]] and was fully adopted by [[Classical Athens|Athens]] by the fifth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/eieol/grkol|title=Introduction to Classical Greek|last=|first=|date=|website=lrc.la.utexas.edu|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Homer British Museum.jpg|thumb|upright|Idealized portrayal of [[Homer]]]]

===Preclassical (800 BC-500 BC)===
The Greeks created poetry before making use of writing for literary purposes. Poems created in the Preclassical period were meant to be sung or recited (writing was little known before the 7th century BC). Most poems focused on myths, legends that were part folktale and part religion. Tragedies and comedies emerged around 600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Greek-literature|title=Greek literature|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-12-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of Greek literature stand the works of [[Homer]]; the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Though dates of composition vary, these works were fixed around 800 BC [[Homeric scholarship|or after]]. Another significant figure was the poet [[Hesiod]]. His two surviving works are ''[[Works and Days]]'' and ''[[Theogony]]''.

===Classical (500 BC-323 BC)===
During the [[Classical antiquity|classical]] period, many of the genres of western literature became more prominent. [[Lyric poetry|Lyrical poetry]], [[ode]]s, [[pastoral]]s, [[elegy|elegies]], [[epigram]]s; [[drama]]tic presentations of [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]]; [[history|histories]], [[rhetoric]]al treatises, [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[dialectic]]s, and philosophical treatises all arose in this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Greek-literature|title=Greek literature|newspaper=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two major lyrical poets were [[Sappho]] and [[Pindar]]. Of the hundreds of [[tragedy|tragedies]] written and performed during this time period, only a limited number of plays survived. These plays are authored by [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schroeder|first=Chad Matthew|date=2016-12-09|year=|title=Review of: A Guide to Hellenistic Literature.

The comedy arose from a ritual in honor of [[Dionysus]]. These plays were full of obscenity, abuse, and insult. The surviving  plays by [[Aristophanes]] are a treasure trove of comic presentation.

Two influential historians of this age are [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]].  A third historian, [[Xenophon]], wrote "Hellenica," which is considered an extension of Thucydides's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schroeder|first=Chad Matthew|date=2016-12-09|year=|title=Review of: A Guide to Hellenistic Literature.

The greatest prose achievement of the 4th century BC was in philosophy. [[Greek philosophy]] flourished during the classical period. Of the philosophers, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]] are the most famous.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Hellenistic (323 BC-31 BC)===
By 338 BC many of the key Greek cities had been conquered by [[Philip II of Macedon]]. Philip II's son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] extended his father's conquests greatly.

The Hellenistic age is defined as the time between the death of Alexander the Great and the rise of Roman domination.  After the 3rd century BC, the Greek colony of [[Alexandria]] in northern [[Egypt]] became the center of Greek culture.

Greek poetry flourished with significant contributions from [[Theocritus]], [[Callimachus]], and [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]. Theocritus, who lived from about 310 to 250 BC, was the creator of pastoral poetry, a type that the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Virgil]] mastered in his [[Eclogues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classes.maxwell.syr.edu/his301-001/when_cultures_collide.htm|title=Historiography of the Hellenistic Age|last=|first=|date=2016-12-09|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drama was represented by the [[New Comedy]], of which [[Menander]] was the principal exponent.

One of the most valuable contributions of the Hellenistic period was the translation of the [[Old Testament]] into Greek. This work was done at Alexandria and completed by the end of the 2nd century BC.

[[File:Strabon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Strabo]]]]

===Roman Age (31 BC-284 AD)===
{{Main article|Latin Literature}}

Roman literature was written in Latin and contributed significant works to the subjects of poetry, comedy, history, and tragedy. A large proportion of literature from this time period were histories.

Significant historians of the period were [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]], [[Polybius]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], [[Appian of Alexandria]], [[Arrian]], and [[Plutarch]]. The period of time they cover extended from late in the 4th century BC to the 2nd century AD.

[[Eratosthenes]] of Alexandria wrote on [[astronomy]] and [[geography]], but his work is known mainly from later summaries. The physician [[Galen]] pioneered developments in various scientific disciplines including anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, and neurology. This is also the period in which most of the [[Ancient Greek novel]]s were written.

The [[New Testament]], written by various authors in varying qualities of [[Koine Greek]], hails from this period. The [[Gospels]] and the [[Pauline epistles|Epistles of Saint Paul]] were written in this time period as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/suic/ReferenceDetailsPage/DocumentToolsPortletWindow?displayGroupName=Reference&amp;jsid=b519e6dc07c52b83c12bc6f1bf327190&amp;action=2&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CCX3448400018&amp;u=tecu60273&amp;zid=ca58d102d83e5cc266963e932dc1954b|title=Student Resources in Context - Document|last=|first=|date=|website=ic.galegroup.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Byzantine literature (290 AD–1453 AD)==
{{Main article|Byzantine literature}}
[[File:Suda.jpg|thumb|160px|A page from a 16th-century edition of the 10th century Byzantine [[encyclopaedia]] of the ancient Mediterranean world, the [[Suda]]]]

Byzantine literature refers to literature of the [[Byzantine Empire]] written in [[Attic Greek|Atticizing]], [[Medieval Greek|Medieval]] and early [[Modern Greek]].

Byzantine literature combined Greek and [[Christian civilization]] on the common foundation of the Roman political system. This type of literature was set in the intellectual and ethnographic atmosphere of the [[Near East]]. Byzantine literature possesses four primary cultural elements: Greek, Christian, Roman, and [[Oriental]].

Aside from personal correspondence, literature of this period was primarily written in the [[Atticism|Atticizing]] style. Some early literature of this period was written in [[Latin]]; some of the works from the [[Latin Empire]] were written in [[French Language|French]].

[[Chronicle]]s, distinct from historic, arose in this period. [[Encyclopedia]]s also flourished in this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/ahri/eventrecords/2015-2016/CHS/Byzantineliterature.aspx|title=King's College London -  A History of Byzantine literature|last=|first=|date=|website=www.kcl.ac.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Greek literature (1453 AD- Present) ==
{{Main article|Modern Greek literature}}
[[File:Manuel Chrysoloras - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Manuel Chrysoloras]], [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|scholar in the Renaissance]]]]Modern Greek literature is written in common [[Modern Greek]]. During this period, the modern vernacular form of the Greek language became more commonplace in writing.

This period saw the revival of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] studies and the development of [[Renaissance humanism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-orb.net/encyclop/late/laterbyz/harris-ren.html Byzantines in Renaissance Italy]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[History of science in the Renaissance|science]].

The [[Cretan Renaissance]] poem ''[[Erotokritos]]'' is a prominent work of this time period. It is a verse [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] written around 1600 by [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]] (1553–1613).

Modern Greek literature is significantly influenced by the [[Diafotismos]], a movement that translated the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|European Enlightenment]] into the Greek world. [[Adamantios Korais]] and [[Rigas Feraios]] are two prominent figures of this movement.

Today, Modern Greek Literature participates in the global literary community. The Greek authors [[George Seferis]] and [[Odysseas Elytis]] have been awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mgsa.org/|title=Modern Greek Studies Association|last=|first=|date=|website=www.mgsa.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8402">{{sociology}}
'''Historical sociology''' is a branch of [[sociology]] focusing on how [[society|societies]] develop through [[history]]. It looks at how [[social structures]] that many regard as natural are in fact shaped by complex social processes. The structure in turn shapes institutions and organizations, which affect the society - resulting in phenomena ranging from [[gender bias]] and [[income inequality]] to [[war]].

Contemporary historical sociology is primarily concerned with how the [[State (polity)|state]] has developed since the [[Middle Ages]], analysing relations between states, classes, economic and political systems.

==Use of history in sociology==
As time has passed, history and sociology have developed into two different specific academic disciplines. Historical data was used and is used today in mainly these three ways.  The first one is: Examining a theory through a Parallel investigation. To correspond with the natural-science conceptions of laws, and to look at, or apply various historical material where you gather your resources in order to prove the theory that is applied. Or on the other hand sociologists for the parallel investigation theory could apply the theory to certain cases of investigation but in a different modalities of a more widely used process. The second theory that sociologists mainly use: applying and contrasting certain events or policies. Analysed by their specific, or what makes them in unique quality of a composition, certain events used by the sociologist for comparative data can be contrasted and compared. For interpretive sociologists it is very common for them to use the 'Verstehen' tradition. And lastly, the third way sociologists typically relate is by taking a look at the causalities from a macro point of view. This is Mill's method: " a) principle of difference: a case with effect and cause present is contrasted with a case with effect and cause absent; and b) principle of agreement: cases with same effects are compared in terms of their (ideally identical) causes. There is an important debate on the usefulness of Mill's method for sociological research, which relates to the fact that historical research is often based on only few cases and that many sociological theories are probabilistic, not deterministic.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, Mathieu. 2007. "Comparative and Historical Sociology: Lecture Notes." &lt;http://deflem.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparative-and-historical-sociology.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Today, historical sociology is measured by a conjunction of questions that are rich in detail.&lt;ref&gt;Clemens, Elizabeth S. "Toward a Historicized Sociology: Theorizing Events, Processes, and Emergence." EBSCOhost. Web. Oct.-Nov. 2010. &lt;http://ezp.tccd.edu:2321/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=119&amp;sid=cd26f66e-45f2-493d-804f-c67b713823ae%40sessionmgr114&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=pbh&amp;AN=26613934&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Path dependence==
[[Path dependence]] to some sociologists is the theory that events that happened in past, have some or a lot of influence on events that happen in the future. However, sociologist James Mahoney has a different definition of path dependence. His theory suggests that "process, sequence, and temporality" have a valid reason for affecting path dependence and the meaning of past historical events. There are three path-dependent analyses with an explanation to how each theory works. "1) the study of causal processes that are especially sensitive, in a sequence, to early historical events, which are more important than later events; 2) these events are contingent occurrences that cannot be explained by prior events or initial conditions; and 3) that once contingent events take place, the path dependent sequence becomes a deterministic pattern."&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, James. "Path Dependence in Historical Sociology." Welcome to the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of South Carolina. 2007. Web. 2 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://www.cas.sc.edu/socy/faculty/deflem/zcomphistnotes.html#problems&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate over general theory in sociology==
James Mahoney revisited the debate over general theory in historical sociology. By bridging the gaps of different assumptions, causal agents and causal mechanisms are connected to the empirical analysis, and this is seen as the general theory.
{{quote|... the debate over general theory in historical sociology with the goal of clarifying the use of this kind of theory in empirical research. General theories are defined as postulates about causal agents and causal mechanisms that are linked to empirical analysis through bridging assumptions. These theories can contribute to substantive knowledge by helping analysts derive new hypotheses, integrate existing findings, and explain historical outcomes. To illustrate these applications, the article considers five different general theories that have guided or could guide historical sociology: functionalist, rational choice, power, neo-Darwinian, and cultural theories. A key conclusion that emerges is that scholars must evaluate both the overall merits of general theory and the individual merits of specific general theories&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, James.

This article is a detailed '''History of the [[Cherokee Language]]''', the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] Indian [[Iroquoian language]] spoken by the [[Cherokee people]].

{{Cherokee language|state=expanded}}

== Origin of the name ==
The Cherokee call their language ''Tsalagi'' ({{lang|chr|ᏣᎳᎩ}}) or ''Tslagi''. They refer to themselves as ''Aniyunwiya'' ({{lang|chr|ᎠᏂᏴᏫᏯ}}), which means "Principal People". The [[Iroquois]] based in [[New York (state)|New York]] have historically called the Cherokee ''Oyata'ge'ronoñ'', which means "inhabitants of the cave country".

Many theories&amp;nbsp;– though none proven&amp;nbsp;– abound about the [[etymology|origin of the name]] "Cherokee". It may have originally been derived from the [[Choctaw language|Choctaw]] word ''Cha-la-kee'', which means "those who live in the mountains", or Choctaw ''Chi-luk-ik-bi,'' meaning "those who live in the cave country".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/tribes/cherokee/cherohist.htm Cherokee Indian Tribe.] ''Access Genealogy.'' (September 21, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[Spanish language|Spanish]] rendering of Cherokee, from 1755, is ''Tchalaquei''.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Hanna, ''The Wilderness Trail'', (New York: 1911).&lt;/ref&gt;
Another theory is that "Cherokee" derives from a [[Muscogee Creek|Lower Creek]] word, ''Cvlakke'' ("chuh-log-gee"),
meaning someone who speaks another language.&lt;ref name=M&amp;M&gt;Martin and Mauldin, "A Dictionary of Creek/Muskogee". Sturtevant and Fogelson, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; In the Lower dialect of {{lang|chr|ᏣᎳᎩ}}, which was traditionally spoken in what is now [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]], the Cherokee called their language ''jaragi,'' as the Eastern or lower dialect had a rolling "r" sound in place of the "l" sound used in the other dialects. This pronunciation may have served as a basis for the current English language name for the people.

The North American origins and eventual English language form of "Cherokee" were researched by [[James Mooney]] in the nineteenth century. In his ''[[Myths of the Cherokee]]'' (1888) he writes:

{{quote|It first appears as ''Chalaque'' in the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] narrative of De Soto's expedition, published originally in 1557, while we find ''Cheraqui'' in a [[French language|French]] document of 1699, and "Cherokee" as an English form as early, at least, as 1708. The name has thus an authentic {{sic}} history of 360 years.|James Mooney, "Myths of the Cherokee"&lt;ref name="Mooney1888"&gt;Mooney, James. King, Duane (ed.). ''Myths of the Cherokee.'' Barnes &amp; Noble. New York. 1888 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Pre-Contact history ==
There are two prevailing views about Cherokee origins, and most of what is known about Cherokee history can be studied through their traditional language. One theory is that the Cherokee, an [[Iroquoian]]-speaking people, are relative latecomers to Southern [[Appalachia]], who may have migrated in late prehistoric times from northern areas, the traditional territory of the later ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'' five nations and other Iroquoian-speaking peoples. Researchers in the 19th century recorded conversations with elders who recounted an oral tradition of the Cherokee people's migrating south from the [[Great Lakes]] region in ancient times. The other theory, which is disputed by academic specialists, is that the Cherokee had been in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] for thousands of years. Pre-contact Cherokee are considered to be part of the later [[Pisgah Phase]] of Southern Appalachia, which lasted from circa 1000 to 1500.&lt;ref&gt;Sturtevant and Fogelson, 132&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1540, The Cherokee lay claim to 40,000 square miles in the southeastern part of what later became the United States. This area included parts of what is now the states of [[Alabama]], Georgia, [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]].

[[File:Tuskegeevillagedwelling.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Reconstruction of a typical Tuskegee Village dwelling at [[Fort Loudoun State Park]], near [[Vonore, Tennessee]]. The original site of [[Tuskegee]] is now under the lake in the background.]]

Much of what is known about pre-19th century Cherokee culture and society comes from the papers of American writer [[John Howard Payne]]. The Payne papers describe the account by Cherokee elders of a traditional societal structure in which a "white" organization of elders represented the seven clans. According to Payne, this group, which was hereditary and described as priestly, was responsible for religious activities such as healing, purification, and prayer. A second group of younger men, the "red" organization, was responsible for warfare. Warfare was considered a polluting activity, which required the purification of the priestly class before participants could reintegrate into normal village life. This hierarchy had disappeared long before the 18th century. The reasons for the change have been debated, with the origin of the decline often located with a revolt by the Cherokee against the abuses of the priestly class known as the [[Ani-kutani]]( "Aní-" is a prefix referring to a group of individuals, while the meaning of "kutáni" is unknown).&lt;ref name="Who Were the Aní-Kutánî?"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/482712?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102076511213 |jstor=482712 |title=Who Were the Aní-Kutánî?

[[File:Blowgun demonstration in Oconaluftee Indian Village, Cherokee, North Carolina.jpg|thumb|right|320px|[[Blowgun]] demonstration in [[Oconaluftee Indian Village]], [[Cherokee, North Carolina]]. Cherokee language and culture have been kept alive together. Today, churches within Cherokee tribal jurisdiction areas give services in the language, and on ceremonial "stomp" grounds ceremonial leaders are required to perform all duties in the language and all information and records are kept in the syllabary.]]

Ethnographer [[James Mooney]], who studied the Cherokee in the late 1880s, first traced the decline of the former hierarchy to this revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Mooney, the structure of Cherokee religious practitioners was more informal, based more on individual knowledge and ability than upon heredity.&lt;ref name = "Irwina-1992"/&gt;

Another major source of early cultural history comes from materials written in the 19th century by the ''didanvwisgi'' (Cherokee: ᏗᏓᏅᏫᏍᎩ), Cherokee [[Medicine man|medicine men]], after [[Sequoyah]]'s creation of the [[Cherokee syllabary]] in the 1820s. Initially only the didanvwisgi used these materials, which were considered extremely powerful.&lt;ref name = "Irwina-1992"/&gt;  Later, the writings were widely adopted by the Cherokee people.

Unlike most other Indians in the American southeast at the start of the historic era, the Cherokee spoke an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian language]]. Since the [[Great Lakes]] region was the core of Iroquoian language speakers, scholars have theorized that the Cherokee migrated south from that region. However, some argue that the Iroquois migrated north from the southeast, with the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] breaking off from that group during the migration.  Linguistic analysis shows a relatively large difference between Cherokee and the northern Iroquoian languages, suggesting a split in the distant past.&lt;ref name="mooney"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mooney | first = James | authorlink = James Mooney | title = Myths of the Cherokee | origyear = 1900 | year = 1995 | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | isbn = 0-486-28907-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glottochronology]] studies suggest the split occurred between about 1,500 and 1,800 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Glottochronology from: Lounsbury, Floyd (1961), and Mithun, Marianne (1981), cited in [http://www.famsi.org/research/hopkins/SouthEastUSLanguages.pdf Nicholas A. Hopkins, ''The Native Languages of the Southeastern United States''].&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient settlement of [[Kituwa]] on the [[Tuckasegee River]], formerly next to and now part of [[Qualla Boundary]] (the reservation of the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]]), is often cited as the original Cherokee settlement in the Southeast.&lt;ref name=mooney/&gt;

== 17th century: English contact ==
In 1657, there was a disturbance in [[Virginia Colony]] as the ''Rechahecrians'' or ''Rickahockans'', as well as the Siouan ''[[Manahoac]]'' and ''[[Nahyssan]]'', broke through the frontier and settled near the Falls of the James, near present-day [[Richmond, Virginia]]. The following year, a combined force of English and [[Pamunkey]] drove the newcomers away.  The identity of the ''Rechahecrians'' has been much debated.  Historians noted the name closely resembled that recorded for the ''Eriechronon'' or ''Erielhonan'', commonly known as the [[Erie tribe]].  The Iroquoian people had been driven away from the southern shore of [[Lake Erie]] by the powerful [[Iroquois]] Five Nations in 1654.  The [[anthropologist]] Martin Smith theorized some remnants of the tribe migrated to Virginia after the wars ([[#refSmith1987|1986:131–32]]). Few historians suggest this tribe was Cherokee.&lt;ref&gt;Conley, ''A Cherokee Encyclopedia'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginian traders developed a small-scale trading system with the Cherokee before the end of the 17th century; the earliest recorded Virginia trader to live among the Cherokee was Cornelius Dougherty or Dority, in 1690.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, ''Myths of the Cherokee'' p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Preston Summers, 1903, ''History of Southwest Virginia, 1746–1786'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The Cherokee sold the traders [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|Indian slaves]] for use as laborers in Virginia and further north.&lt;ref name="gallay"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Gallay |first= Alan |title= The Indian Slave Trade: The Rise of the English Empire in the American South 1670–1717 |year= 2002 |publisher= Yale University Press |isbn= 0-300-10193-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 18th century ==
{{Further|Cherokee military history}}

Over the course of the 18th century, the number of Cherokee speakers declined sharply. In the 1730s the population halved due to commercial trade with [[England]] that resulted in the spread of diseases such as [[smallpox]] to which the indigenous peoples had no immunity. In the 1780s the Cherokee people faced genocidal wars with British settlers, significantly the [[Anglo-Cherokee War]], and conflicts with other tribes including the [[Muscogee]].

[[File:Sequoyah.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Sequoyah]], inventor of the Cherokee syllabary]]

Before the development of the [[Cherokee syllabary]] in the 1820s, Cherokee was a spoken language only. The Cherokee syllabary is a [[syllabary]] invented by [[Sequoyah]] in the late 1810s and early 1820s to write the Cherokee language. His creation of the syllabary is particularly noteworthy in that he could not previously read any script. He first experimented with [[logogram]]s, but his system later developed into a syllabary.  In his system, each symbol represents a [[syllable]] rather than a single [[phoneme]]; the 85 (originally 86){{Sfn | Sturtevant | Fogelson | 2004 | p = 337}} characters in the Cherokee syllabary provide a suitable method to write Cherokee. Some symbols do resemble the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and even the [[Cyrillic script]]s' letters, but the sounds are completely different (for example, the sound /a/ is written with a letter that resembles Latin D).

Around 1809, Sequoyah began work to create a system of writing for the Cherokee language.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/science/23cherokee.html?ref=science | title=Carvings From Cherokee Script's Dawn | work=New York Times | date=June 22, 2009 | accessdate=June 23, 2009 | author=Wilford, John Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first he sought to create a [[Logogram|character for each word]] in the language.

He then tried making a symbol for every idea, but this also caused too many problems to be practical.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Davis, John B. ''Chronicles of Oklahoma.'' Vol. 8, Number 2.

Sequoyah did not succeed until he gave up trying to represent entire words and developed a symbol for each syllable in the language. After approximately a month, he had a system of 86 [[Grapheme|characters]], some of which were [[Latin script|Latin]] letters he obtained from a spelling book.&lt;ref name="gc"/&gt; "In their present form, many of the syllabary characters resemble Roman, [[Cyrillic]] or [[Greek letters]] or [[Arabic numerals]]," says Janine Scancarelli, a scholar of Cherokee writing, "but there is no apparent relationship between their sounds in other languages and in Cherokee."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Unable to find adults willing to learn the syllabary, he taught it to his daughter, ''Ayokeh'' (also spelled Ayoka).&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Langguth says she was only six years old at the time.&lt;ref name="Langguth"&gt;Langguth, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled to the Indian Reserves in the [[Arkansaw Territory]] where some Cherokee had settled. When he tried to convince the local leaders of the syllabary's usefulness, they doubted him, believing that the symbols were merely ''[[ad hoc]]'' reminders. Sequoyah asked each to say a word, which he wrote down, and then called his daughter in to read the words back. This demonstration convinced the leaders to let him teach the syllabary to a few more people. This took several months, during which it was rumored that he might be using the students for sorcery. After completing the lessons, Sequoyah wrote a dictated letter to each student, and read a dictated response. This test convinced the western Cherokee that he had created a practical writing system.&lt;ref name="boudinot"/&gt;

[[File:Sequoyah Arranged Syllabary .png|thumb|left|Sequoyah's syllabary in the order that he originally arranged the characters.]]

When Sequoyah returned east, he brought a sealed envelope containing a written speech from one of the Arkansas Cherokee leaders. By reading this speech, he convinced the eastern Cherokee also to learn the system, after which it spread rapidly.&lt;ref name="gc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boudinot"/&gt; In 1825 the Cherokee Nation officially adopted the writing system. From 1828 to 1834, American missionaries assisted the Cherokee in using Sequoyah's syllabary to develop type characters and print the ''[[Cherokee Phoenix]]'', the first [[newspaper]] of the Cherokee Nation, with text in both Cherokee and English.&lt;ref name="Sequoyah"&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-618&amp;sug=y "Sequoyah"], ''New Georgia Encyclopedia'', accessed January 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1826, the Cherokee National Council commissioned George Lowrey and David Brown to translate and print eight copies of the laws of the Cherokee Nation in the new Cherokee language using Sequoyah's system.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

Once [[Albert Gallatin]] saw a copy of Sequoyah's syllabary, he found the syllabary superior to the English alphabet. Even though the Cherokee student must learn 85 characters instead of 26, he can read immediately. The student could accomplish in a few weeks what students of English writing could learn in two years.&lt;ref name="Langguth" /&gt;

In 1824, the General Council of the Eastern Cherokee awarded Sequoyah a large silver medal in honor of the syllabary. According to Davis, one side of the medal bore his image surrounded by the inscription in English, "Presented to George Gist by the General Council of the Cherokee for his ingenuity in the invention of the Cherokee Alphabet." The reverse side showed two long-stemmed pipes and the same inscription written in Cherokee. Supposedly, Sequoyah wore the medal throughout the rest of his life and it was buried with him.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;

By 1825, the Bible and numerous religious hymns and pamphlets, educational materials, legal documents and books were translated into the Cherokee language. Thousands of Cherokee became literate and the literacy rate for Cherokee in the syllabary was higher than that of whites in the [[English alphabet]].

Though use of the Cherokee syllabary declined after many of the Cherokee were relocated to [[Indian Territory]], present day [[Oklahoma]], it has survived in private correspondence, renderings of the Bible, and descriptions of Indian medicine&lt;ref name = britannica&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/109503/Cherokee-language|title=Cherokee language|website= www.britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now can be found in books and on the internet among other places.

{{main|Bible translations into Cherokee}}

[[File:CherokeeBible.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[New Testament]] translated into the Cherokee language, front page in 1860.]]

In 1824 the first portion of the Bible was translated into the Cherokee language: [[Gospel of John|John]] 3, translated by a native Cherokee, At-see (also known as John Arch). It was circulated in manuscript and received with enthusiasm, being widely recopied.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Biography of Se-Quo-Yah, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; He completed the Gospel of John by 1824&lt;ref&gt;Cherokee Messenger, by Althea Bass&lt;/ref&gt; The complete [[New Testament]] was translated in September 1825 by [[David Brown (translator)|David Brown]], also a native Cherokee; this was also circulated in manuscript form, as a type for the [[Cherokee syllabary]] had not yet been created. Both Archer and Brown translated the full New Testament into Cherokee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ubs-translations.org/fileadmin/publications/tbt/technical/TBT_TP_Jan06_Owens.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cherokee printing|first actual printing]] of a Bible portion in Cherokee appeared in the Missionary Herald of December 1827, and consisted of the first verse of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], translated by [[Samuel Worcester]]. In 1828, David Brown, together with a man named George Lowrey, translated [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]. This was printed in the [[Cherokee Phoenix]] from April 3, 1828 to July 29, 1829. It is uncertain if this translation was ever published in book form.

[[File:Adams Corner - Kirche 7.jpg|thumb|left|Translation of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] into the Cherokee language, 1856]]

Samuel Worcester, and [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]], editor of the Cherokee Phoenix, published a revised translation of Matthew in 1829. This was published by the Cherokee National Press, [[New Echota]]. In the second edition, published in 1832, there is a statement that this translation had been "compared with the translation of George Lowrey and David Brown."&lt;ref&gt;Early Bibles of America, by John Wright, pg. 278&lt;/ref&gt; A third edition was printed by the Park Hill Mission Press in 1840.

Worcester and Boudinot continued with translation, publishing [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] in 1833 and [[Gospel of John|John]] in 1838. Worcester, together with Stephen Foreman, published John 1–3 in 1840, [[First Epistle to Timothy|1]] and [[Second Epistle to Timothy|2 Timothy]] in 1844, [[Epistle of James|James]] in 1847, [[First Epistle of Peter|1]] and [[Second Epistle of Peter|2 Peter]] in 1848, [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] in 1850, [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] in 1853, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] in 1856, [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] in 1857, and [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] through [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] in 1858. With the assistance of Charles C. Torrey, they published [[Epistle to Philippians|Philippians]] through [[2 Thessalonians]], [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] through [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] and [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]] through [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] in 1859. Besides the first three books translated together with Boudinot, Matthew (1829), Acts (1833), and John (1838), which were published in [[New Echota]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], all the rest of Worcester's texts were published by the Park Hill Mission Press. In the meantime, Evan and John B. Jones had published [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] [[1 Thessalonians|1]] and [[2 Thessalonians]], Titus, Jude, and [[Epistle to Philemon|Philemon]] in 1847, and [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] through [[Epistle to the Colossians|Colossians]], 1 and 2 Peter in 1848 and Romans, [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1]] and [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians|2 Corinthians]], Hebrews and Revelation in 1849. Their work was published by the Cherokee Baptist Mission.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Eric North, Eugene Nida, The Book of a Thousand Tongues, United Bible Societies, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; The full New Testament was published by the American Bible Society in 1860.

=== Removal ===
{{See also|Thomas Jefferson and Indian Removal}}
{{Main|Trail of Tears|Cherokee Removal}}

Cherokee removal, part of the [[Trail of Tears]], refers to the [[Ethnic cleansing|forced relocation]] between 1836 and 1839 of the [[Cherokee]] Nation from their lands in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[South Carolina]], [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Texas]], and [[Alabama]] to the [[Indian Territory]] (present day [[Oklahoma]]) in the [[Central United States]], which resulted in the death of an estimated 4000 Cherokee.

In the Cherokee language, the event is called ''Nu na da ul tsun yi'' (the place where they cried); another term is ''Tlo va sa'' (our removal). However, this phrase was not used by Cherokee at the time, and seems to be of [[Choctaw]] origin.  The Cherokee were not the only [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] to emigrate as a result of the [[Indian Removal]] efforts. American Indians were not only removed from the [[Southern United States|American South]] but also from the [[Northern United States|North]], [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], and [[Great Plains|Plains]] regions. The Choctaws, [[Chickasaw]]s, and [[Creek Indian]]s ([[Muscogee (Creek)|Muskogee]]) emigrated reluctantly. The [[Seminole]]s in [[Florida]] resisted removal by [[guerrilla warfare]] with the [[United States Army]] for decades (1817–1850). Ultimately, some Seminoles remained in their Florida home country, while others were transported to Indian Territory in shackles.

The '''history of the Jews in Speyer''' reaches back over 1,000 years. In the [[Middle Ages]], the city of [[Speyer]] (formerly Spira), [[Germany]], was home to one of the most significant [[Jews|Jewish]] communities in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Its significance is attested to by the frequency of the Ashkenazi Jewish surname [[Shapiro]]/Shapira and its variants Szpira/Spiro/Speyer. After many ups and downs throughout history, the community was totally wiped out in 1940 during [[the Holocaust]]. With the [[revolutions of 1989|fall of the Iron Curtain]] in 1989 Jews again settled in Speyer and a first assembly took place in 1996.

==The beginnings in 1084==
The earliest reference to Jewish settlement along the Rhine dates from the year 321 in [[Cologne]], and it is assumed that Jews also lived in Speyer in [[Late Antiquity]]. With the collapse of state and church administration in the [[Migration Period]] and the decline of the urban Roman lifestyle, it is also assumed that Jewish communities dispersed. Jews resettled in the Rhine area coming from southern France where Roman life had more or less remained intact. Traveling Jewish merchants certainly would have had dependencies in Rhenish towns, even though the first branches are only mentioned in 906 for [[Mainz]], and 960 for [[Worms, Germany|Worms]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;''Historischer Verein der Pfalz, Bezirksgruppe Speyer: Geschichte der Juden in Speyer'', Progressdruck GmbH Speyer 1981, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; With the construction of [[Speyer Cathedral]], beginning in 1032, Speyer emerged as one of the major towns along the Rhine. The first records of Jews in Speyer appear in the 1070s. They were members of the renowned [[Kalonymos family]] of Mainz, which had migrated a century before from Italy. Other Jews from Mainz had possibly also settled in Speyer.

The actual history of the Jews in Speyer started in 1084, when Jews fleeing from [[pogrom]]s in Mainz and Worms took refuge with their relatives in Speyer. They possibly came at the instigation of bishop Rüdiger Huzmann (1073–1090), who invited a larger number of Jews to live in his town with the expressed approval of emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]]. In his privilege or charter (''Freiheitsbrief'') for the Jews, the bishop wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the name of the holy and undivided trinity, I, Rüdiger, with the surname of Huozmann, bishop of Speyer, in my endeavor to turn the village of Speyer into a city, believed to multiply its image a thousand times by also inviting Jews. I had them settle outside the quarters of the other inhabitants and as not to have them disquieted by the insolence of the lowly folk I had them surrounded by a wall. Now the place of their habitation which I acquired justly (for in the first place I obtained the hill partly with money and partly by exchange, while I received the valley by way of gift from some heirs) that place, I say, I transferred to them on condition that they pay annually 3 ½ pounds in silver for the use of the brethren. I have granted also to them within the district where they dwell, and from that district outside the town as far as the harbour, and within the harbour itself, full power to change gold and silver, and to buy and sell what they please. And I have also given them license to do this throughout the state. Besides this I have given them land of the church for a cemetery with rights of inheritance. This also I have added that if any Jew should at any time stay with them he shall pay no [[thelony]]. Then also just as the judge of the city hears cases between citizens, so the chief rabbi shall hear cases which arise between the Jews or against them. But if by chance he is unable to decide any of them they shall go to the bishop or his chamberlain. They shall maintain watches, guards, and fortifications about their district, the guards in common with our vassals. They may lawfully employ nurses and servants from among our people. Slaughtered meat which they may not eat according to their law they may lawfully sell to Christians, and Christians may lawfully buy it. Finally, to round out these concessions, I have granted that they may enjoy the same privileges as the Jews in any other city of Germany. Lest any of my successors diminish this gift and concession, or constrain them to pay greater taxes, alleging that they have usurped these privileges, and have no episcopal warrant for them, I have left this charter as a suitable testimony of the said grant. And that this may never be forgotten, I have signed it, and confirmed it with my seal as may be seen below. Given on September 15, 1084, etc.&lt;ref&gt;''Historischer Verein der Pfalz, Bezirksgruppe Speyer: Geschichte der Juden in Speyer'', Progressdruck GmbH Speyer 1981, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="s-lessmann.de"&gt;http://www.s-lessmann.de/Die%20Entstehung%20der%20Kammerknechtschaft%20der%20Juden.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Altmann &amp; Bernheim, eds., ''Ausgewählte Urkunden zur Erläuterung der Verfassungsgeschichte Deutschlands im Mittelalter'', (Berlin: [[Weidmannsche Buchhandlung]], 1904), p. 156, reprinted in Roy C. Cave &amp; Herbert H. Coulson, ''A Source Book for Medieval Economic History'', (Milwaukee: The Bruce Publishing Co., 1936; reprint ed., New York: Biblo &amp; Tannen, 1965), pp. 101–102 - [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1084landjews.html fordham.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The settlement mentioned in this privilege is the former suburb of Altspeyer in the area to the east of today's railway station. The "valley" refers either to a moat-like grove to the north of the Weidenberg (today Hirschgraben) or to the low areas around the stream of the Speyerbach. This walled settlement for Jews was well to the north outside the walls of the city proper and it is the first documented [[ghetto]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook, Mary: ''A Concise History of Germany'', Cambridge University Press, 1991, p. 20, {{ISBN|0-521-83320-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish community had to mend and guard the walls of Altspeyer themselves.

The charter granted by bishop Huzmann went well beyond contemporary practice anywhere else in the empire. The Jews of Speyer were allowed to carry out any kind of trade, exchange gold and money, own land, have their own laws, justice system and administration, employ non-Jews as servants, and were not required to pay tolls or duties at the city's borders. The reason for asking the Jews to come to Speyer was their important role in the money and trade businesses, especially with distant regions. Money lenders were needed on a large scale for the construction of the [[Speyer Cathedral|cathedral]]. The deliberate settlement of Jews was seen as a measure for ''business development''. The Jews can also be regarded as pioneers of urban development in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Haverkamp, Alfred: ''Deutsche Geschichte'', Vol. 2, Beck'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, München, 1993, p. 338, {{ISBN|3-7632-2992-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishops, lords or kings who granted privileges and protection to the Jews were at the same time securing for themselves considerable revenues and protection fees; since persecution of Jews and trade restrictions led to considerable economic disadvantages and loss of revenues, it was in the ruler's best interest to restrain the antisemitic fervor of the lower clergy and the public.

With the aid of bishop Huzmann the Jews of Speyer had their rights and privileges confirmed and even expanded ("sub tuicionem nostram reciperemus et teneremus") by Henry IV as he departed on his third punitive expedition to Italy in 1090.&lt;ref name="s-lessmann.de"/&gt;&lt;ref name="juedisches-recht.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juedisches-recht.de/lex_erg_gerichtsbarkeit.php|title=Rechtswörterbuch - SIEBTE ABTEILUNG - Ergänzungsartikel - GERICHTSBARKEIT ÜBER JUDEN|work=juedisches-recht.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights and privileges which had been especially granted to the Jews of Speyer, in particular to Judah ben [[Kalonymos family|Kalonymus]], David ben Meshullam, and Moses ben Ghutiel (Jekuthiel),&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1003&amp;letter=S|title=SPEYER - JewishEncyclopedia.com|work=jewishencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; were extended to all the Jews of the empire. This Imperial Jews Charter was one of the first in Germany. The regulations concerned various political, legal, economical and religious aspects of life, most prominently free enterprise, the sale of goods to Christians and protection of property. A new regulation was that Jews who acquired stolen goods had to sell them back at the same price if the former owner wished to buy them. This constituted a major improvement because it greatly reduced the business risk for the Jews who had often been subject to accusations that they were dealing in stolen goods. In the event of disagreements between Jews and Christians from then on the "right of the concerned" was to be employed, which meant that Jews could also prove their case by oath or witness. [[Trial by ordeal|Trials by ordeal]] were forbidden. Jews were also allowed to address the emperor or the imperial court directly in case of difficulties. Among each other they could use their own courts, which was to help avoid [[arbitrariness]] by Christian judges. Torture of any kind was strictly forbidden, and in the case of murder or injury the privilege stated that fines were to be paid to the emperor. The privilege also introduced strict rules for baptisms. Forced baptisms of children were totally outlawed. Jews voluntarily getting baptised were required to think it over for three days. Conversions were also made more difficult in that baptised Jews would lose their rights to inheritance. Basically, these regulations were meant to protect the size of the Jewish community and to ensure continued revenues. Jews were also allowed to employ Christian maids, [[wet nurse]]s and labourers in their homes as long as it was ensured that they could observe the Christian Sundays and holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digam.net//?dok=8497|title=Digitales Archiv Marburg - Das DigAM Projekt|work=digam.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the original charter granted by the bishop nor its re-enactment by the emperor proved sufficient to afford the Jews adequate protection.

The two charters of 1084 and 1090 marked the beginning of the "golden era" of the Jews in Speyer which, with limitations, was to last into the 13th or 14th century. They also called for a sound Jewish community in the town by that time. According to these documents, an "Archisynagogos", also called a "Jews bishop" (episcopus Iudeorum) presided the administration as well as the court of the community. He was elected by the community and confirmed by the bishop. Later, sources report of a "Jews council" of twelve presided by the Jews bishop who represented the community outside. In 1333 and 1344, the authority of the Jews council was expressly confirmed by the city council of Speyer.&lt;ref&gt;''Historischer Verein der Pfalz, Bezirksgruppe Speyer: Geschichte der Juden in Speyer'', Progressdruck GmbH Speyer 1981, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Massacres of 1096==
{{further information|Rhineland massacres}}
Only twelve years after granting the first privileges for Jews in the empire a wave of [[pogrom]]s swept the country, triggered by an epidemic of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], which was blamed on the Jews, and the [[First crusade]]. The Jews of Speyer were among the first to be hit, but compared to the communities in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and [[Mainz]], which followed a few days later, they got off lightly.

On 3 May 1096, Count [[Emicho|Emicho of Leiningen]] stopped in Speyer on his way to the crusade and, together with burghers of Speyer and peasants from nearby, attacked the Jews and the synagogue.&lt;ref name="jewishhistory.org.il"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishhistory.org.il/history.php?search=Speyer&amp;dosearch.x=8&amp;dosearch.y=10&amp;dosearch=Search|title=Jewish History|work=jewishhistory.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report on the pogroms of 1096 in Speyer and Worms, written 1097–1140 by the so-called ''[[s:Mainz Anonymous (Wikisource)|Mainz Anonymous]]'', it says: "And it happened on the 8. day in the month of [[Iyar]] (6 May 1096), on a Sabbath, the last judgement started to come upon us as the mistaken and city dwellers rose in Speyer against the holy men, the pious of the Almighty; they conspired against them to seize them together in the synagogue. This came to their attention, so they rose early in the morning, even on Sabbath, prayed briefly and left the synagogue. And when they (the enemy) noticed that their plan to seize them together couldn't be followed, they rose against them and killed eleven souls among them….And it happened when Bishop John heard of this, he came with many troops and wholeheartedly stood by the community, he took them into his private quarters and saved them from their hands"&lt;ref name="digam.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digam.net/?dok=8496|title=Digitales Archiv Marburg - Das DigAM Projekt|work=digam.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bishop had the rioters punished severely and the Jews stayed in the bishop's palace on the northern side of the cathedral and in other nearby towns until the rage of the mob had subsided. Taking this action, which the Jews paid him for, the bishop of Speyer (Johann vom Kraichgau I, 1090–1104) prevented massacres and expulsions as happened in other cities of the Rhineland, thus saving himself and the town a valuable source of revenues. 800 Jews perished in the pogroms of Worms and even 1000 in Mainz.&lt;ref&gt;Schlickel, Ferdinand: Speyer. ''Von den Saliern bis heute'', Hermann G. Klein Verlag, Speyer&lt;/ref&gt; The events in Speyer are also mentioned in Solomon Bar Simson's chronicle on the Pogroms of 1096 which he wrote around 1140.&lt;ref name="digam.net"/&gt;

==Flourishing times==
[[File:Judenbad Speyer 3 First Room view.jpg|thumb|250px|First room in the medieval mikveh in Speyer.]]

[[File:Judenbad Speyer 4 changing alcove in first room.jpg|thumb|left|Changing alcove in the Speyer Mikveh]]

Around the time of these events a second Jewish quarter was established in the vicinity of the cathedral along modern day Kleine Pfaffengasse which used to be the [[Judengasse]] (Jews Alley) while the settlement with a synagogue continued to exist in Altspeyer. It is estimated that the Jewish community of Speyer consisted of 300 to 400 people. Around 1100, on the Judengasse (today Pfaffengasse), the Jews built the Judenhof ([[Jewish courtyard]]) as the centre of their community containing a [[mikveh]] with a pool at groundwater level for ritual baths, a men's and later a women's synagogue. The synagogue, designed and built by the same architects as the cathedral of Speyer, was consecrated on 21 September 1104, eleven years after the pogrom of 1096. It fell into disuse in the 16th century but its ruins today represent the oldest visible remnants of a mikveh in central Europe. Today it is an archaeological heritage site and has been made accessible; the pool is still supplied by groundwater.

Along with the [[Frisians]], the Jews made up the majority of the long distance merchants in the 11th and 12th centuries. Both groups had their headquarters in the merchant's quarters right at the free cathedral territory. Members of the Kalonymos family lived in Speyer at that time and took a leading part in the development of Jewish studies in Germany. One example is [[Jekuthiel ben Moses]], a liturgical poet and author of the reshut יראתי to [[Kalir]]'s Kerobah for the feast of [[Rosh Hashana]]. A son of Jekuthiel named Moses of Speyer has been quoted as a high Talmudical authority. Another Kalonymos from Speyer for some time was responsible for the finances of emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Barbarossa]].&lt;ref&gt;Haverkamp, Alfred: ''Deutsche Geschichte'', Bd. 2, Beck'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, München, 1993, S. 339, {{ISBN|3-7632-2992-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another famous man of letters, [[Jehuda ben Samuel he-Chasid]], called Jehuda the Pious, and the son of the German [[halachist]] [[Balak]]ist [[Kalonymus ben Isaac the Elder]], was born 1140 in Speyer.
In these years the Jewish community of Speyer became one of the most significant in the Holy Roman Empire. It was an important centre for [[Torah]] studies and, in spite of pogroms, persecution and expulsion, it had considerable influence on the spiritual and cultural life of the city. In a synod of Rabbis in [[Troyes]] around 1150 the leadership of the Jews in Germany was transferred to the Jewish communities of Speyer, Worms and Mainz. This was confirmed by a convention of Rabbis in Mainz. The three communities created a federation called "SHUM" ('''שום''': initials of the Hebrew names of the three cities: Shpira ([[Hebrew]]: '''שפירא'''), Warmaisa, Magenza) and kept this leadership until the middle of the 13th century. Over a period of decades, these communities enacted a body of regulations known as [[Takkanot Shum|Takkanot SHUM]]. The SHUM-Cities had their own [[rite]] and were accepted as central authority in legal and religious matters. Speyer had renowned Jewish schools and a highly frequented [[Yeshiva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/speyer_judenbad_synagoge.htm|title=Speyer: mittelalterliches Judenbad, Synagoge und Judengasse|work=alemannia-judaica.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their high esteem in the Middle Ages the three SHUM-Cities were praised as "Rhenish Jerusalem". They had considerable influence on the development of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi culture]]. In the 13th century Issac ben Mose Or Sarua from Vienna wrote: "From our teachers in Mainz, Worms and Speyer the teachings were spread to all of Israel ...", and all the communities in Germany and in the Slavic kingdoms were followers.&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, Fritz: ''Warmaisa: 1000 Jahre Juden in Worms'', Verlag Books on Demand GmbH, 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-8391-0201-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, even in this flourishing period of the Speyer Jewry, there were outbursts of violence in 1146 during the [[Second Crusade]], in which not only laymen but also members of the clergy took part. This came to the attention of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] who wrote a letter of reproach to Bishop Günther. Among the victims of this pogrom was a woman named Minna, whose ears and tongue were cut off because she refused to submit to baptism.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt;

==Pogroms and expulsions beginning 1195==
In the wake of the [[Third Crusade]] in February 1195 the Jewish community of Speyer was subject to new persecutions during which nine Jews were killed. On 13 February the daughter of Rabbi and judge Isaak ben Ascher Halevi the Younger (*1130) was accused of ritual murder ([[blood libel]]), killed and displayed in the market square for three days. Halevi himself was killed when he tried to interfere and recover his daughter's body from the mob.&lt;ref name="jewishhistory.org.il"/&gt; Many Jews sought refuge on the high balcony of the synagogue where they had to remain until Hezekiah ben Reuben of [[Boppard]] and Moses ben Joseph ha-Kohen effected their release by paying a ransom. The Jews fled and their homes were plundered and burned; the synagogue in Altspeyer was destroyed. When Emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] returned from Apulia the perpetrators were compelled to pay damages to him as well as to the Jews.

Riots again occurred in Speyer in 1282 over a [[blood libel]] when Herbord, Ritter von der Ohm, accused the Jews of having murdered his grandson. The ensuing rage among the populace had Bishop Werner lay the matter before the provincial synod of [[Aschaffenburg]] on September 8, 1282. In the following year Emperor [[Rudolph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph]] approved the decision of this synod and ordered property to be taken from the Jews and reverted to the royal treasury. As the persecutions in Speyer continued, the Jews of Speyer and neighboring Mainz, Worms, and Oppenheim decided to emigrate to the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref name="bh.org.il"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Speyer |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/speyer |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Led by Meir B. Baruch in 1286,&lt;ref name="bh.org.il"/&gt; the attempt was ill-fated and the property of the few who actually succeeded was confiscated. On June 24, 1291, Rudolph issued another order for taxes, requiring the Jews of Speyer to maintain the newly established Fort and garrison of [[Landau]].

At the beginning of the 14th century the powers of the emperor and the bishop were weakened; for a payment of 300 pounds heller the city of Speyer took on the protection of the Jews, which proved as ineffectual as that of the bishop.

On Easter week, 1343, when the body of a Christian named Ludwig was found, Jews were tortured and burned at the stake. On March 11, 1344, Speyer requested the king's permission to confiscate the houses of these Jews for the benefit of the city, which was granted.
During the great [[Plague (disease)|plague]] of 1348/49 pogroms swept through France and Germany, especially the [[Rhineland]], and on 22 January 1349 the Jewish community of Speyer was totally wiped out. Many chose to be burned in their homes, among them Rabbi Eliakim, others converted or fled to [[Heidelberg]] or [[Sinzheim]]. In one account, the burnt corpses were collected into empty winecasks and rolled into the Rhine. Property and the cemetery were confiscated.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishhistory.org.il/history.php?startyear=1340&amp;endyear=1349|title=Jewish History 1340 - 1349|work=jewishhistory.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In view of this ''breach of the urban order of peace'' (Bruch der städtischen Friedensordnung), which was to protect all the city dwellers alike, emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], who came to Speyer in spring 1349, declared on March 29, 1349, that the city had no blame whatsoever for the riots. Some of the Jews who had managed to escape returned to Speyer beginning in 1352, but were driven out anew the following year only to be allowed to return again in 1354, when they were assigned to quarters between Webergasse and the old school. On December 24 of that year, their synagogue and school, their cemetery and their "Dantzhus" or "Brutehus" were returned to them. In 1364 Bishop Adolph borrowed 800 guilders from the Jews for a weekly interest of one Strassburg pfennig. Bishop Nicolaus (1390) granted the Jews permission to settle in any city within the Speyer diocese on payment of a yearly tribute of 15 guilders. One half of this income went to the garrison, the other to the diocese. In 1394 King [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia|Wenceslaus]] renewed the decree of 1349 by Emperor Charles IV, which declared the Jews to be the property of the city.

The Jewish community of Speyer never regained the size and status it had had before 1349.  In the years between the pogroms the relations between Jews and Christians were tense and the Jews had to put up with many restrictions.  From 1405 to 1421 they were entirely banned from the city. On February 11, 1431, King [[Sigismund]] ordered that any complaint brought against Jews in Speyer should be heard only before the municipal court, indicating that Jews lived in Speyer that year. There is a document from 1434 in which the Speyer council renewed the right of the Jews to live in the city for another six years, for which 5 to 35 Gilders were to be paid per household. Yet, the council again had to yield to the demands of the citizens and decree an expulsion; as early as the following year, on 8 May 1435, the Jews were again expelled "for ever" from the city. The decree said: ''The council is compelled to banish the Jews; but it has no designs upon their lives or their property: it only revokes their rights of citizenship and of settlement.  Until November 11 they are at liberty to go whither they please with all their property, and in the meantime they may make final disposition of their business affairs.''&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt; One of the refugees from Speyer was Moses Mentzlav whose son, Israel Nathan, founded a printing house in [[Soncino family (printers)|Soncino]], Italy.&lt;ref name="jewishhistory.org.il"/&gt;

Again, for 1467 there is a document confirming that the city of Speyer welcomed Jews for the duration of another ten years at the instigation of the bishop because he had special powers to set rules for the livelihoods of the Jews. In the years 1468, 1469 and 1472 bishop Matthias von Rammung decreed that all Jews in Speyer were to live together in one area and that they might have a synagogue. They were to wear clothes of such a fashion as to distinguish them from the Christians. Men were to wear pointed hats in different colours (this had already been decided at the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] in 1215) and a yellow ring on their chest. There are documents showing Jews of Speyer already wearing pointed hats by the mid-14th century. Jewish women had to wear two blue ribbons in their veils. Jews were forbidden to participate in the public occasions of the Christians, employ Christian servants or midwives, sell medicines, or engage in [[usury]]. Jews had to stay out of public areas and were to keep their windows and doors closed during [[Holy Week]] and important holidays. In 1472 many Jews committed suicide to avoid forced [[baptism]]. As of 1500/1529 there were no Jews in Speyer.

==The "Great Jews Privilege Charter" of Speyer 1544==
[[File:Judenprivileg1544S1.pdf|thumb|Great Jews Privilege Charter of Speyer 1544 (Großes Speyrer Judenprivileg), Insertion in the confirmation of 1548, page 1 of 7]]
At the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|diet]] of 1544 in Speyer the Jews of the empire complained to emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] that they were mistreated and denied their given rights. This included beatings, tortures and killings, imprisonment, robbery, expulsion, closing of schools and synagogues, payment of tolls and duties and the denial of the right to appeal to the imperial or other courts.&lt;ref&gt;The complaint stated that the Jews had been: "gewaltigelich, fraventlich und muetwillig an ihren persohnen, leiben, haab und güettern mit tottschlagen, rauben, wegfüren, außtreibung ihrer heußlichen wohnungen, versperung und zerstörung ierer schuellen und sinagogen, deßgleichen an gelaiten und zollen belaidigt und beschwerdt … nit allain ierer haab und güetter entsetzt, geblündert und außgetriben, sondern auch ohne alle unser rechtliche erkhanndtnuß gefangen, gepeiniget, vertilgt und umb leib und guett"; quoted in: {{cite web|url=http://www.historicum.net/themen/reformation/reformation-politikgeschichtlich/das-reich-rahmenbedingungen/1g-reichsstaedte/|title=historicum.net|work=historicum.net}}{{Failed verification|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trigger for the new wave of [[antisemitism]] in the empire can be seen in [[Martin Luther]]'s antisemitic writings of 1543.

Accordingly, Charles V considered it necessary to renew and confirm the Jews' charter. At the same time these rights and privileges were extended to the Jews of the whole empire. Nobody was to have the right to close their schools and synagogues, to drive them out or hinder their use. Whoever violated the imperial ''constitutio pacis'' by infringing upon the rights of the Jews was to be punished by every authority. Every Jew was to have the right to do business in the empire and every authority was to protect him and not burden him with tolls or duties. Jews were not required to wear "Jewish insignias" outside of their dwellings and no Jew was to be driven from his home without the emperor's expressed consent. Because Jews paid higher taxes but had no public offices, real estate or manual trade, they were allowed to charge higher interest rates than the Christians. It was forbidden to accuse Jews of using Christian blood without due proof and witness, to take them prisoner, to torture or to execute them. Infringements of this privilege were to be fined with 50 marks in gold, one half to be paid to the emperor and the other to the Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicum.net/themen/reformation/reformation-politikgeschichtlich/das-reich-rahmenbedingungen/1g-reichsstaedte/|title=historicum.net|work=historicum.net}}{{Failed verification|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1548 this charter was once more confirmed by Charles V and again by emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] in 1566.&lt;ref name="juedisches-recht.de"/&gt;

==17th, 18th and 19th centuries==
From 1621 to 1688 Jews again settled in Speyer. It was especially during the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the following years that the indebted cities saw themselves forced to make use of their financial power. In Speyer at least five such loans are documented between 1645 and 1656. The city started taking out loans from Jews as early as 1629. This enabled the Jews to anticipate the town's forthcoming profits in trade matters, which got them into conflict with the [[guild]]s. So, because of complaints, the Jews trading rights were restricted several times for short periods of time during the 17th century. Before Speyer was burned down by the French in 1689, trade and financial transactions with Jews had been totally banned. In the following years of reconstruction Jews were not allowed to resettle permanently.

Until 1750, the internal affairs of the small community were administered by the rabbi of Worms for an annual compensation of 10 Reichsthaler. Visits by the rabbis required official permission, as documents from 1682, 1685, 1698, 1713, and 1746 show. In the last-named document a reference is made to "our rabbi David Strauss of Worms". Episcopal edicts in 1717, 1719, 1722, 1726, 1727, 1728, 1736, 1741, and 1748 prohibited Romanies and Jews having no safe-conducts from visiting the diocese estates; and those that were provided with safe-conducts were required, for sanitary reasons, to submit their bundles or packages to a rigid examination.
As of 1752 the Jews were forbidden, on pain of severe punishment, to employ the services of any rabbi other than their own. The first rabbi of Speyer was Isaac Weil (1750–63), succeeded by Löwin Löb Calvaria, whose salary was provided by a bequest in the testament of a Jew named Süssle.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt;

At the end of the 18th century, a Jewish community re-established itself in Speyer after the [[French Revolution]]. It distinguished itself by its liberal and emancipated attitudes which repeatedly brought it into conflict with the more conservative district rabbinate of [[Bad Dürkheim]]. In 1828 it founded a welfare club and contributed to the efforts of the city council fighting the great poverty in the town. In 1830 the Speyer Jewish community had 209 members. In 1837 it built a new synagogue on the site of the former church of St. Jacob on Heydenreichstraße; the synagogue included a little school.

In 1863 Carl David became the first Jewish council member in Speyer. A leading figure of the Jews, Sigmund Herz, was member of the city council from 1874 to 1914. By 1890 the Jewish community had grown to 535 members, the greatest number ever in Speyer; by 1910 the number had diminished to 403. In the early 1930s Speyer Jews started leaving for larger cities or to emigrate because of rising antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;''Geschichte der Stadt Speyer'', Vol. II, p. 21–22, 150, Kohlhammer Verlag, Stuttgart, 1983, {{ISBN|3-17-007522-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Jewish community in the 20th century and today==
[[File:Speyer Jewish community memorial plaque.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial plaque in the Speyer Judenhof]]
[[File:SpeyerMahnmalJuden.JPG|thumb|Monument commemorating the deported Jews of Speyer at the site of the former synagogue]]
By 1933, the number of Jews in Speyer had fallen to 269, and by the time their synagogue was torched in the '''[[Kristallnacht|November pogroms of 1938]]''' (Kristallnacht) there were only 81 left. In the night of 9 November, SA and SS troops looted the synagogue on Heydenreichstraße, taking away the library, precious cloths, carpets and ritual utensils and setting the building alight. The firemen only kept an eye on the neighbouring buildings. Along with the synagogue the Jews also lost their school. The same night the Jewish cemetery was also vandalized. The debris of the synagogue was removed in the following days, which was billed to the Jewish community. A member of the community supplied a prayer room in his house on Herdstraße. The city later used this house as a storage for furniture left behind by deported Jews.

On 22 October 1940, 51 of the 60 Jews remaining in Speyer were deported to the [[internment]] camp of [[Gurs]] in southern [[Vichy France|France]]. Some of them managed to escape to Switzerland, the USA and South Africa with the aid of locals, while others were deported to Germany and murdered at [[Auschwitz]]. Only one Jew survived the Nazi era hidden in Speyer.

In 1951, the city of Speyer considered putting a parking lot on the site of the former synagogue. In 1955 the council decided on a payment of 30,000 DM to the German Jewish community (as settlement of a restitution procedure). In 1959 the department store company Anker bought the whole block, including the empty lot of the former synagogue, for Speyer's first department store on Maximilianstraße (today Kaufhof). At the recommendation of the German Cities Council, Speyer bought development bonds from the State of [[Israel]] worth 2,000 DM in 1961.

In 1968, a commemorative plaque was unveiled in the court of the mikveh commemorating the fate of the Speyer Jews. In 1979 another plaque was attached at the back wall of the Kaufhof department store building where the synagogue once stood. Right in front of the site a monument was erected in 1992. Shortly after it was moved across the street to its present place because of the restricted space.&lt;ref&gt;Eger, Wolfgang: ''Geschichte der Stadt Speyer'', Vol. 3, Kohlhammer Verlag Stuttgart, 1989, {{ISBN|3-17-010490-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no majority for a 2007 [[Motion (legal)|motion]] in the council by the Social Democratic Party to have commemorative brass cobblestones (so-called [[Stolpersteine]] or "stumbling stones") placed in the pavement in front of buildings where Jews lived until their deportation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.speyer-aktuell.de/page.php?modul=Article&amp;op=show_pdf&amp;aid=10196{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been done in many other German cities.

[[File:SpeyerJewishMorgue.JPG|thumb|left| Mortuary and eastern wall of Jewish cemetery at St. Klara Klosterweg (until 1888)]]

Up to the 1990s there was no Jewish community in Speyer. It was only in October 1996 that a first assembly took place. Ten Jews who had emigrated from Eastern Europe decided to found a new Jewish community. It was also decided to build a new synagogue by extending the former medieval church of St. Guido. The [[cornerstone]] of the Synagogue Beith-Shalom was laid on 9 November 2008. Consecration took place on 9 November 2011 in the presence of [[President of Germany|President]] [[Christian Wulff]], [[Premier]] [[Kurt Beck]], Speyer Mayor Hansjörg Eger, Bishop [[Karl-Heinz Wiesemann]] and Church President Christian Schad. A very honoured guest was Jack Mayer, born 1930 in Speyer, who had fled with his mother and brother to the United States in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://speyer-aktuell.de/uebersicht-speyer/13531-ort-der-begegnung-und-des-dialogs-speyerer-synagoge-sichtbares-zeichen-fuer-grosse-juedische-tradition-mit-fotoserie spa: ''Ort der Begegnung und des Dialogs: Speyerer Synagoge als sichtbares Zeichen für große jüdische Tradition''], in www.speyer.aktuell.de, Report from 10 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval Jewish cemetery of Speyer lay opposite the Judenturm (Jews' tower) to the west of the former Jews' quarter in Altspeyer (today between Bahnhofstraße and Wormer Landstraße). After the pogroms of 1349 it was ploughed under and in 1358 the city returned some of it as [[leasehold estate]]. After the expulsion of 1405 the area was owned by a Christian but in 1429 the Jews were able to retrieve it. After the expulsion of 1435 the city confiscated the cemetery and leased it to Christians. In the 18th century it was the garden plot of the poor house (Elendherbergsacker). After Jews resettled in Speyer in the 19th century, a new cemetery was built at St. Klara Klosterweg and remained in use until 1888. The former mortuary and a part of the western wall are still in place. In 1888, the Jewish cemetery was moved to the new city cemetery built in the north of Speyer along Wormser Landstraße, where it now occupies the southeastern section.

'''Howard &amp; Bullough''' was a firm of textile machine manufacturers in [[Accrington]], Lancashire. The company was the world's major manufacturer of power looms in the 1860s.

==History==
The firm of Howard and Bleakley was founded in 1851 with four workers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hyndburnbc.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=393|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613205839/http://www.hyndburnbc.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=393|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 June 2011|title=A Brief History of the Globe Works|publisher=Hyndburn Council|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1856 Bleakley retired and the partnership was changed to Howard &amp; Bullough. John Bullough had perfected a self-acting temple on his handloom, and with William Kenworthy at Brookhouse Mills had been responsible for the [[Lancashire Loom]].&lt;ref name="Spinning the Web"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/m_display.php?irn=62&amp;sub=factory&amp;theme=industry&amp;crumb=Inventions+%26amp%3B+inventors|title=Spinning the Web|publisher=Manchester City Council|accessdate=26 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1856 they employed 150&amp;nbsp;workers; John's son James joined in 1862. They initially concentrated on looms, but eventually expanded to manufacture the complete range of machinery used in a [[cotton mill]].

John Bullough, (b. 1837) died in 1891. By then Bulloughs was the world's largest manufacturer of ring spinning frames, and John, the owner of the Isle of [[Rùm]], was the first cotton machine manufacturing millionaire. Three of the company's executives, Edmund and Samuel Tweedale and Joseph Smalley left to set up business in Castleton, Rochdale. The firm was [[Tweedales and Smalley]]. The company's first spindles equipped the [[Newhey Spinning Mill]] in February 1893.

Bulloughs was one of the country's largest manufacturers. At its peak the [[Globe Works, Accrington|Globe Works]] dominated the town, employing almost 6,000&amp;nbsp;workers and covering {{convert|52|acre|ha}}. Seventy-five&amp;nbsp;percent of the company's production was exported.

===1914 lock-out===
[[File: Queen Street Mill - Cylinder Sizing Machine - geograph.org.uk - 528575.jpg|thumb|left|A 1919 Cylinder Tape [[Textile sizing machine|Sizing Machine]] built by Howard &amp; Bullough installed at [[Queen Street Mill]] Textile Museum, Burnley]]
Following the refusal of Howard &amp; Bullough's management to meet the demands of the [[Amalgamated Society of Engineers (UK)|Amalgamated Society of Engineers]] (ASE) for trade union recognition and a minimum wage, up to 600 engineers at the works went on strike on 2 July. Six days later, the management locked-out the whole workforce of nearly 5,000 men and boys. Although members of the A.S.E. received £1/week lock-out pay while on strike and 1100 members of the [[Gasworkers and General Labourers Union]] received 10s (50 pence)/week, some 2,000 non-union workers were left without any income. At this time, the defensive [[Battle of Mons]] was being fought and the War Office was actively seeking to recruit men. A [[Pals battalion]] had been raised in Manchester, and the Mayor of Accrington undertook to raise a battalion of [[Accrington Pals|Accrington Men]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pals.org.uk/enlistment.htm |title=Accrington Pals Regiment |last=Jackson |first=Andrew C. |year=2002 |accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War they turned to manufacture of armaments such as bayonets, shells, gun carriages, mine sinkers and aircraft components.

In the recession of the 1930s, [[Platt Brothers]], Howard and Bullough, [[Brooks &amp; Doxey|Brooks and Doxey]], [[Asa Lees]], [[Dobson &amp; Barlow|Dobson and Barlow]], [[Joseph Hibbert(manufacturer)|Joseph Hibbert]], [[John Hetherington &amp; Sons|John Hetherington]] and [[Tweedales and Smalley]] merged to become [[Textile Machinery Makers Ltd]]., but the individual units continued to trade under their own names until the 1970s, when they were rationalised into one company called Platt UK Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.platt.co.uk/history2.htm |title=Platt maker of quality textile machinery and parts |accessdate=17 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229104525/http://www.platt.co.uk/history2.htm |archivedate=29 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 the company changed its name to Platt Saco Lowell.&lt;ref name="Lily"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lily-elsie.com/howard.htm |title=Howard and Bullough, Cotton Machinery Manufacturers |accessdate=26 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Globe Works closed in 1993.

==Bullough's inventions==

James Bullough improved his loom by inventing various components, including the "self-acting temple", which kept the woven cloth at its correct width, the weft fork (patented 1841 but disputed by Osbaldeston) and a loose reed that allowed the lathe to back away on encountering a shuttle trapped in the warp. Bullough also invented a simple but effective warning device which rang a bell every time the warp thread broke on his loom. He worked with William Kenworthy at Brookhouse Mills, with whom he applied his inventions to develop an improved power loom that became known as the Lancashire Loom.

John Bullough, with James Whittaker and John Walmsley, developed a machine, patented in 1852, that sized two warps and wound them on two beams simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Aspin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oneguyfrombarlick.co.uk/forum_topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=478&amp;FORUM_ID=20&amp;CAT_ID=9&amp;Forum_Title=Names&amp;Topic_Title=The+Bullough+family.++By+Chris+Aspin|title=The Bullough Family|last=Aspin|first=Chris|work=One Guy from Barlick|publisher=Stanley C Graham|accessdate=17 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723183827/http://oneguyfrombarlick.co.uk/forum_topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=478&amp;FORUM_ID=20&amp;CAT_ID=9&amp;Forum_Title=Names&amp;Topic_Title=The+Bullough+family.++By+Chris+Aspin|archivedate=23 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
In accordance with the traditions of the times, Bulloughs attempted to improve the lives of its workers with acts of philanthropy. It gave James Bullough Park to the town of Accrington in 1913, and the Globe Tennis club grounds in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hyndburnbc.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=110&amp;pageNumber=4|title=History of Bullough Park|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6518">In April 1900, Professor L. A. Grosclaude of Geneva proposed the '''Invariable Calendar''', '''New Era Calendar''', or '''Normal Calendar''' with 12 months and four 91-day quarters of exactly 13 weeks. An additional day, termed New Year's Day, that was not any day of the week and not part of any month, would occur between December 31 and January 1. Another such day is inserted between June 31 and July 1 on leap years.

This model would be a [[Perennial Calendar|perennial calendar]], with each date occurring perennially on the same day of the week. Grosclaude lists many business advantages to this. Three monthly days important to businesses, the 1st, 15th, and 30th would always occur on the same 3 days of the week, respectively, and additionally would never occur on a Sunday, for example. It became the model for [[The World Calendar]], promoted by Elisabeth Acheils and [http://www.theworldcalendar.org The World Calendar Association] since 1930.

== Criticism ==
* The [[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Sabbatarian]] objection, that the strict cycle of the seven-day week is interrupted; sometimes there are seven days between sabbaths, instead of the usual six.
* Difficulties of defining the dates of New Year's and Leap Days when they don't belong to any month or week.

'''John Wilberforce "Jack" Buckland''' (1864–1897), also known as '''"Tin Jack"''', was a trader who lived in the South Pacific in the late 19th century.  He travelled with [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and his stories of life as an island trader became the inspiration for the character of Tommy Hadden in ''[[The Wrecker (Stevenson novel)|The Wrecker]]'' (1892).&lt;ref name="Jack Buckland 2001 p. 418."&gt;Hadden is described as being based upon Jack Buckland ("Tin Jack") a well-known remittance man and copra trader in Sydney.

==Early life==
Jack Buckland was born in 1864 in [[Sydney]], the eldest child of William Wilberforce Buckland and Harriet Emmeline Hopkins. His mother was born in Sydney in 1842, the daughter of John Hopkins, a ship chandler&lt;ref name="letter1936"/&gt; who died when she was young. Her father's business partner, John Carr, and his wife Eliza later adopted Harriet in addition to the ship chandler business. Buckland's father was from [[Wraysbury]] in England, the son of an [[auctioneers|auctioneer]], [[William Thomas Buckland]]. Buckland's father worked as a merchant and shipbroker in Australia and in 1863 married the 21-year-old Harriet Hopkins in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13081805 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=21 July 1863 |accessdate=9 May 2011 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckland was their first child, born in 1864. When he was 9, Buckland's family returned to England, leaving him with the now elderly John and Eliza Carr who adopted him as their son. John Carr was therefore Buckland's stepfather as well as step-grandfather.
 
The Carr family lived in a house called "Neepsend" in Lavender Bay, North Sydney.&lt;ref name="letter1936"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17290419 |title=LAVENDER BAY. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=8 September 1936 |accessdate=9 May 2011 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this property was later sold and it was from this sale that John Carr made sufficient money to provide Jack with his allowance. John Carr died in 1881 and the money from the property sale was left in a trust from which Jack received an annual allowance. In 1883, now living on his own, Jack visited his parents and siblings living near London in England. Later he returned to Sydney and subsequently worked for [[Thomas Henderson (New Zealand politician)|Henderson and Macfarlane]] of Auckland, as a copra trader.&lt;ref name="Flude"&gt;[http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~tonyf/CSL/ ''The Circular Saw Shipping Line''],  Anthony G. Flude. 1993. (Chapter 7)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life of an island trader==
[[File:Nonouti Kiribati.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Nonouti Atoll]]
From the mid-1880s to about 1891, Buckland was a trader at [[Nonouti]] atoll, in [[Kiribati]] (at the time known as the Gilbert Islands)&lt;ref&gt;Journal entry 11 April 1890, ''The Cruise of the Janet Nichol among the South Sea Islands'' A Diary by Mrs Robert Louis Stevenson (first published 1914), republished 2004, editor, Roslyn Jolly (U. of Washington Press/U. of New South Wales Press)&lt;/ref&gt;  and during the 1890s he traded at [[Niutao]] and [[Nanumea]] in [[Tuvalu]] (at the time known as the Ellice Islands).&lt;ref name=" Munro 1987"&gt;{{cite book | author= Doug Munro |  title=''The Lives and Times of Resident Traders In Tuvalu: An Exercise in History from Below'' | year= 1987 | publisher= 10(2) Pacific Studies 73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARMII"&gt;{{cite web| last =  Resture | first = Jane| title = The Alfred Restieaux Manuscript Part II|url= http://www.janeresture.com/ar3.htm | accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resident trader who succeeded him on Niutao was [[Fred Whibley]].

Buckland's primary income was £700 a year, paid to him by the trustee of the trust fund established by John Carr. That amount was sufficient to allowed him to live comfortably for part of the year in Sydney.  To supplement this income, Buckland worked as a trader in the central Pacific.  This was an isolated existence where he was likely to be the only European on a Pacific atoll. As a trader working for a trading company, he bought [[copra]] (dried coconut flesh), and [[sharks fin]] and [[sea cucumber]]s, for sale into Asia, as well as selling islanders tobacco and other European goods.

As a trader, Buckland chose an isolated life on a Pacific atoll rather that being a castaway or beachcomber. Howe (1984) estimated that in 1850 there were over 2,000 beachcombers throughout [[Polynesia]] and [[Micronesia]].&lt;ref&gt;K.R.Howe, ''Where the Waves Fall: A New South Sea Islands History from First Settlement to Colonial Ruler'' (1984), 103.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not only shipwrecked sailors forced, by circumstances, into a life of [[beachcombing]] with many choosing to escape from a life of respectability in the [[Victorian era]].&lt;ref&gt;Milcairns, Susanne Williams (2006) ''Native Strangers: Beachcombers, Renegades and Castaways in the South Seas'', Auckland: Penguin Books (New Zealand).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David A. Chappell ''Secret Sharers: Indigenous Beachcombers in the Pacific Islands'' (1994) 17 (2) Pacific Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cruise of the ''Janet Nicoll''==
As a respite from the isolated life on a Pacific atoll Jack Buckland would spend time enjoying the high life of Sydney where, in few months, he would dissipate his income.  Furnas (1951) describes Jack Buckland as spending "a short period each year in Sydney playing spendthrift on the accumulations of a small funded income and the rest of the year vegetating penniless as a petty trader out in the islands."&lt;ref&gt;Furnas J.C. ''Voyage to Windward: The Life of Robert Louis Stevenson'', Apollo ed. New York: William Sloane Associates (1951) 365&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1890 he was a passenger on the trading steamer the "Janet Nicoll", which left Sydney for a trading cruise around the central Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;"Janet Nicoll" is the correct spelling  of the trading steamer owned by Henderson and Macfarlane of Auckland, New Zealand, which operated between Sydney, Auckland and into the central Pacific. [[Fanny Van de Grift|Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson]] miss-names the ship as the ''Janet Nicol'' in her account of the 1890 voyage,''The Cruise of the Janet Nichol''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], his wife [[Fanny Van de Grift|Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson]], and her son Lloyd Osborne were also passengers on that voyage.  The journal of [[Fanny Van de Grift|Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson]] was published under the title ''The Cruise of the Janet Nichol''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cruise of the Janet Nichol among the South Sea Islands'' A Diary by Mrs Robert Louis Stevenson (first published 1914), republished 2004, editor, Roslyn Jolly (U. of Washington Press/U. of New South Wales Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson explained the origin of the name ‘Tin Jack’ as being the island equivalent of ‘Mr Jack’.&lt;ref&gt;Journal entry 11 April 1890, ''The Cruise of the Janet Nichol among the South Sea Islands'' A Diary by Mrs Robert Louis Stevenson (first published 1914), republished 2004, editor, Roslyn Jolly (UWP /UNSW)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fanny Van de Grift|Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson]] recounts how Jack Buckland, inadvertently caused a fire on the ''Janet Nicoll''. In [[Auckland]], New Zealand, Jack Buckland purchased ten pound of ‘calcium fire’ (fireworks); cartridges, grease paint, and false nose and a wig for the entertainment of the islanders at Jack's trading station on [[Nonouti]] atoll. However, on leaving harbour the ‘calcium fire’, which was promised by the chemist to be "safe as a packet of sugar", spontaneously caught alight causing the fireworks to explode in technicolour flashes endangering the ship – until the crew put out the fire.&lt;ref&gt;Journal entry 20 April 1890, ''The Cruise of the Janet Nichol among the South Sea Islands'' A Diary by Mrs Robert Louis Stevenson (first published 1914), republished 2004, editor, Roslyn Jolly (UWP /UNSW)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tin Jack and the character of Tom Hadden==
Jack Buckland is acknowledged by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], as the inspiration for the character of Tom Hadden in [[The Wrecker (Stevenson novel)|The Wrecker]] (1892), for which Stevenson and Lloyd Osborne shared the writing.&lt;ref name="Jack Buckland 2001 p. 418"&gt;Hadden is described as being based upon Jack Buckland (‘Tin Jack’) a well-known remittance man and copra trader in Sydney. ''Selected Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson'', ed. by Ernest Mehew (New Haven &amp; London: Yale University Press, 2001) p. 418, n. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Buckland also receives a dedication in [[Island Nights' Entertainments]] (also known as South Sea Tales) a collection of short stories by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], first published in 1893. This collection is dedicated to Jack Buckland, Ben Hird, ([[supercargo]] or manager of the cargo owner's trade) and Harry Henderson partner in the firm [[Thomas Henderson (New Zealand politician)|Henderson and Macfarlane]]  that owned the ''Janet Nicoll.'' A character referred to as ‘young Buncombe’ and inspired by Jack Buckland makes a brief appearance in chapter 2 of [[The Beach of Falesá]].&lt;ref name="Booth"&gt;''The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson. Volume Seven, September 1890 – December 1892'', Bradford A. Booth and Ernest Mehew (Editors). Yale University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-300-06213-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Buckland stayed at [[Vailima, Samoa|Vailima]] with Robert and Fanny Stevenson in 1894. In later correspondence to Lieutenant Eeles, an officer on ''[[HMS Curacoa (1878)|H.M.S. Curacao]]'', Stevenson expresses his pleasure that his correspondent had met Jack Buckland:&lt;ref&gt;Letter Stevenson to Eeles of 15 November 1892, ''Selected Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson'', ed. by Ernest Mehew (New Haven &amp; London: Yale University Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"But the cream of the fun was your meeting with Burn. We not only know him, but (as the French say) we don't know anybody else; he is our intimate and adored original; and – prepare your mind – he was, is, and ever will be, TOMMY HADDON! As I don't believe you to be inspired, I suspect you to have suspected this. At least it was a mighty happy suspicion. You are quite right: Tommy is really 'a good chap,' though about as comic as they make them."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While [[The Wrecker (Stevenson novel)|The Wrecker]] was not a commercial or critical success, in adopting Jack Buckland as a character, Stevenson describes a specific era of European engagement with the Pacific.  Watson (2007) describes Stevenson's ''The Wrecker'' as "a prophetically postmodern vision of a depthless world of travel, exile, novelty and rootlessness, of 'discarded sons' whose corruption, in a world they neither understand nor fully belong to, is curiously innocent."&lt;ref name="RW"&gt;{{cite web|first=Roderick|last=Watson |title =The unrest and movement of our century: the universe of The Wrecker |url= http://storre.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/839/1/The%20unrest%20and%20movement%20of%20our%20century.pdf|accessdate= 4 December 2014|edition= |series= |volume=|date= 2007|month= |origyear= |publisher=(2007) 4 The Journal of Stevenson Studies 114-128|location= |language= |isbn=|oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tin Jack and Vailima, Samoa==
The letters of Robert Louis Stevenson of January 1894 also record that Jack Buckland, and his "avaga" ('married one' in the Niutaon language) Meri Matavaka of the Luaseuta family of [[Niutao]],&lt;ref&gt;identified in S. Aris, ''[[Fred Whibley]] and his Family'' (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; visited [[Vailima, Samoa]] for three weeks. Jack Buckland was still at Vailima on 6 February 1894.&lt;ref&gt;''Memories of Vailima'' by Isobel Strong &amp; Lloyd Osbourne, Archibald Constable &amp; Co: Westminster (1903)&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at Vailima Jack Buckland is mentioned as flirting with Addie (Adelaide),&lt;ref&gt;''Selected Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson'', ed. by Ernest Mehew (New Haven &amp; London: Yale University Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of [[Henry Clay Ide|Henry Ide]], American Chief Justice in Samoa.&lt;ref name="TheDailyBulletin1893"&gt;{{cite news | title=Bound for Samoa: New Chief Justice and Land Commissioner, Both from America. | newspaper = The Daily bulletin | page = 3 | date= October 27, 1893 | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | url = http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016412/1893-10-27/ed-1/seq-3/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Buckland then became the island trader on [[Nanumea]] in [[Tuvalu]] in about 1895. Meri Matavaka refused to move to Nanumea, the oral history of the Luaseuta family is that Jack Buckland abandoned Meri Matavaka in [[Sydney]], Australia; her father travelled from [[Niutao]] to bring Meri back to [[Niutao]]. Meri Matavaka became the "avaga" ('married one') of [[Fred Whibley]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Aris, ''[[Fred Whibley]] and his Family'' (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Tin Jack==
[[File:Suwarrow-AnchorageIsland-01.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Anchorage Island, [[Suwarrow]]]]
Robert Louis Stevenson draws directly from the life of Jack Buckland in describing Tom Hadden in [[The Wrecker (Stevenson novel)|The Wrecker]] as being "''heir to a considerable property, which a prophetic father had placed in the hands of rigorous trustees''." (p.&amp;nbsp;296). Tin Jack's dissolute life came to an end in 1897.  A sanitised version of the death of Jack Buckland published by Simpson (1913) describes him as being blown to pieces by an explosion on [[Suwarrow]] Island.&lt;ref&gt;Eve. Blantyre Simpson, ''The Robert Louis Stevenson Originals'' (1913) 195&lt;/ref&gt; Fanny Stevenson in her journal of the voyage of the "Janet Nicoll" published in 1914 described the trustee that provided Jack with the majority of his income as defrauding the trust of all the funds:&lt;ref&gt;post-script added to Journal entry 8 July 1890, ''The Cruise of the Janet Nichol among the South Sea Islands'' A Diary by Mrs Robert Louis Stevenson (first published 1914), republished 2004, editor, Roslyn Jolly (UWP /UNSW)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; "Some years ago when Jack was at his station he received word that his trustee, who was in charge of his property, had levanted it all. Whereupon poor Jack put a pistol to his head and blew out what brains he possessed. He was a beautiful creature, terribly annoying at times, but with something childlike and appealing--I think he was close to what the Scotch call a natural--that made one forgive pranks in him that which would be unforgivable in others. He was very proud of being the original ‘Tommy Hadden’ in [R. L. Stevenson's book] ‘The Wrecker,’ and carried the book wherever he went." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Jacob Theodor Klein''' (nickname ''Plinius Gedanensium''; 15 August 1685 – 27 February 1759) was a [[German people|German]] [[jurist]], [[historian]], [[botanist]], [[zoologist]], [[mathematician]] and [[diplomat]] in service of Polish King [[August II the Strong]].

==Life==
Klein was born on 15 August 1685 in [[Königsberg]], [[Duchy of Prussia]] (now [[Kaliningrad]], [[Russia]]).&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz41363.html|title=Klein, Jacob Theodor - Deutsche Biographie|last=Biographie|first=Deutsche|website=www.deutsche-biographie.de|language=de|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied natural history and history at the [[University of Königsberg]]. Between 1706 and 1712, Klein travelled through England, Germany, Holland and Austria in an educational journey, before returning to Königsberg.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cds.library.brown.edu/projects/Gottsched/topicsSimple.php?selected=danzigNotablesKlein&amp;..|title=Luise K. Gottsched: Topics|last=Group|first=Scholarly Technology|website=cds.library.brown.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to Danzig after the death of his father, where he was elected city secretary in 1713. Between 1714 and 1716 he served as the city’s representative, or “resident secretary at court,” (''residierender Sekretär'') in Dresden and then Warsaw.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://de.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=ADB:Klein,_Jacob_Theodor&amp;oldid=2499981|title=ADB:Klein, Jacob Theodor – Wikisource|website=de.wikisource.org|language=de|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein began his scientific works in 1713 and began publishing his findings by 1722, as a member of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna|Institute of Sciences in Bologna.]] Influenced by [[Johann Philipp Breyne]], his works dealt with matters of zoological nomenclature, and he set up his own system of classification of animals, which was based on the number, shape, and position of the limbs. He used his position as secretary to found a [[botanical garden]] there (now called ''Ogród Botaniczny w Oliwie).''&lt;ref name=":33"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;

For his work in the natural sciences, Klein had been rewarded with membership of several scientific societies, including the [[Royal Society]] in London, the Academy of in St. Petersburg, the ''Deutsche Gesellschaft'' in Jena, and the [[Danzig Research Society]].&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;

One of Klein’s daughters, Dorothea Juliane Klein, married physicist Darniel Gralath, who would become mayor of Danzig. Gralath inherited Klein’s library, which was praised by Swiss mathematician Jogann Bernoulli.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

Klein died on 27 February 1759 in Danzig.&lt;ref&gt;Armin Geus: [https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/gnd117523216.html#ndbcontent "Klein, Jacob Theodor"]. In: ''[[Neue Deutsche Biographie]]'' (NDB). Band 11, Duncker &amp; Humblot, Berlin 1977, pp. 740ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Botanical garden and "Museum Kleinianum" ==
[[File:Garten und Museumshaus von Jakob Theodor Klein.jpg|thumb|An illustration of Klein's botanical garden by Johann Mentzel (1750), featured on the title page of Klein's ''Historiae Avium Prodromus'']]
Using his position as secretary of [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] and with the help of other scholars, Klein set up a botanical garden in 1718, which was one of, if not the largest of its time.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhbs.com/naturgeschichte-der-seeigel-the-natural-history-of-sea-urchins-book|title=Naturgeschichte der Seeigel [The Natural History of Sea Urchins]|website=www.nhbs.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garden was expanded to include live animals, zoological, fossil and amber collections, the shell collection of the mayor of Amsterdam [[Nicolaes Witsen|Nicolaus Witsen]], as well as a greenhouse which he used for experimentation with exotic plants. The collection became known as the Museum Kleinianum. It was sold to  [[Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Margrave Friedrich of Brandenburg-Kulmbach]] in 1740.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":33"/&gt; After the Margrave's death in 1763, the collection was donated to the [[Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg|Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fau.eu/university/about-fau/collections-and-museums/geoscience-collections/|title=Geoscience collections › Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was praised by prominent Swiss mathematician [[Johann Bernoulli]], who visited the museum in 1777 or 1778.

=== System of classification ===
Inspired by [[Johann Philipp Breyne|Johann Phillipp Breyne]], Klein developed an interest in science as early as 1713 and began publishing in 1722.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; He was especially interested in the systematic classification of living organisms, but excluded insects from his classifications.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; His system was based on external, easily identifiable traits, such as the number, shape and position of limbs. This put his work in opposition with that of [[Carl Linnaeus|Carl von Linné]], of whom he was critical,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hans|first=Aili,|last2=W|first2=Pietsch, Theodore|date=2014|title=Jacob Theodor Klein&amp;apos;s Critique of Peter Artedi&amp;apos;s Ichthyologia (1738)|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=5320&amp;aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&amp;af=%5B%5D&amp;searchType=SIMPLE&amp;sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&amp;language=en&amp;pid=diva2:774895&amp;aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&amp;sf=all&amp;aqe=%5B%5D&amp;sortOrder=author_sort_asc&amp;onlyFullText=false&amp;noOfRows=50&amp;dspwid=5320|journal=Svenska Linnésällskapets årsskrift}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whose work has since garnered more widespread recognition, though some of Klein's classifications are still in use, for example, in the naming of echidnoderms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3HkuAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=jacob+theodor+klein&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Iiqh87kFHC&amp;sig=TpCfpNRj_EM07tQpg3z-MYNG6XY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3vIicvNzaAhVK5YMKHY84A-E4FBDoAQhRMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=jacob%20theodor%20klein&amp;f=false|title=Collected papers|last=Jordan|first=David Starr|date=1898|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; His work on sea urchins was the most prominent source of information on the species at the time.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; His essay ''Tentamen Herpetologiae (1755)'' featured the first mention of the term [[herpetology]] - the study of amphibians. However, his system of classification meant that species such as frogs and lizards, which belong to amphibians and reptiles respectively, were not distinguished as belonging to separate classes.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Klein was critical of Linnaeus' system of classification, believing only easily recognisable features could be used to classify animals, as Adam had done when naming animals according to the Biblical story of creation.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;

Klein published ''Historiae Piscium Naturalis promovendae Missus primus Gedani'' in 1744. The publication, dedicated to the [[Royal Society]], focused on understanding the auditory capacity of cartilaginous and spinose fishes. According to John Eames, until the publication of the work, it was believed to have been understood that only cetaceous fish were known to have auditory passages, or ear holes, and that the question of whether fish could hear was still not understood. Aristotle claimed, in his ''"History of Animals,"'' that fishes possessed no evident auditory organs, but believed that nonetheless they must hear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=G. H.|date=1918|title=A Critical Survey of the Sense of Hearing in Fishes|jstor=984161|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|volume=57|issue=2|pages=69–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Preface, Klein cites the work of [[Giulio Cesare Casseri|Giulio Casare Casseri]], who discovered bones in the heads of Pike or Jack fish, which he understood to be their organs of hearing, though he did not discover any manifest external auditory passages. In section of the essay titled ''De Lapillis, eorumque Numero in Craniis Piscium'' (roughly translated as “The bones, their number in the skull of Fish”) Klein considers what parts of the head of fish serve as the organ of hearing, and by what passages the sensation of sound is communicated to them. He refers to these bones as Ossicula – little bones – and considers them essential parts of the head, generated with the brain itself. He notes that the bones scale proportional to the size of the fish, and are most easily discovered in the heads of Spinose fish. Klein identifies three pairs of bones to which he attributes the sense of hearing, and he takes to correspond to the Incus, [[Malleus]] and [[Stapes]] of other animals. The first are the two largest, which he explains are easily found; the other two pairs, he explains, are small, difficult to find, enveloped in distinct fine membranes. Klein believed one could determine the age of fish by analysing the number and thickness of the Laminae and fibres of these bones. The bone to which Klein was referring, now called the otolith, acquires a growth ring every day for at least the first six months of its life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1209_021209_TVFishEarBones.html|title=Fish Ear Bones Hold Clues to Migration|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein inquiries into the nature of the passages by which vibrations produce a sense of hearing. He inspects the head of a Pike fish and observes several holes with bristles which lead to the auditory bones. He later dissected a Sturgeon fish and traced the auditory duct to the membrane in which the three bones are placed. Klein concludes that fishes do indeed have hearing organs and passages, communicated to through slight vibrations, though these passages are not easily demonstrable in many species. He observes that the auditory organs of cetaceous, cartilaginous and spinose fish differ from one another in structure and substance. The auditory organs of cetaceous fish are bony, while they are more fragile for cartilaginous fishes, he explains. He adds that water does not act as an impediment to hearing, but rather is the “intermedium” by which sound is communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eames|first=John|date=1743-01-01|title=X.

== Honours ==
Klein had been awarded the membership of several scientific societies, including the [[Royal Society]] in London, the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|St. Petersburg Academy]], and the [[Danzig Research Society]].&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; The name of the genus [[Kleinia]] was given to the plant family of Compositae (Asteraceae) by Linnaeus in honour of Klein's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critica Botanica|last=Linnaeus|first=Carl|publisher=Leiden|year=1737|isbn=|location=|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Genera Plantarum|last=Linnaeus|first=Carl|publisher=Leiden|year=1742|isbn=|location=|pages=394}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was described as the most important natural philosopher of his century by Professor [[Johann Daniel Titius]].&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Although well respected by his colleagues,&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Klein was nonetheless accused by some contemporaries of being unscientific, alleging that he based his beliefs on the hearsay and the claims of ‘credulous’ people. The 1760 edition of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London published a letter by 18th Century botanist and Fellow of the Royal Society, [[Peter Collinson (botanist)|Peter Collinson]], criticizing Klein for his belief that swallows (sand martins) are not migratory birds, and instead ‘retire under water’ during winters. Collinson accused Klein’s assertion as being “contrary to nature and reason,” and provided observations of Marine officers, such as [[Charles Wager|Sir Charles Wager]], to further his claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collinson|first=Peter|date=1759-01-01|title=XL.

'''Norman John Klugmann''' (London, 27 February 1912 – London, 14 September 1977), generally known as '''James Klugmann''',&lt;ref&gt;Concise [[Dictionary of National Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt; was a leading British [[Communist]] [[writer]] who became the official historian of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].

==Background and Early Career==
Born Norman John Klugmann, in 1912 in Hampstead, he later adopted the name James His father was a tobacco pipe merchant, the family lived on Haverstock Hill, Hampstead, London.
His sister Kitty Cornforth was also a committed Communist, marrying Maurice Cornforth. Harry Hodson, in his memoirs, recalls visiting the Klugmann family home and recounts of James Klugmann, that "his background was impeccably bourgeois."

Educated at [[The Hall School, Hampstead]], [[Gresham's School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] (at both of which he was a friend and contemporary of the spy [[Donald Duart Maclean|Donald Maclean]]), Klugman joined the [[Communist Party]] of Great Britain (CPGB) in 1933 whilst studying at [[Cambridge]], where he won a double first.

Klugmann was at pains to deny any connection with spying during his lifetime and a long period of secret service surveillance on him threw up no obvious proof. He had however been on the fringes of such activity, which no doubt gave rise to suspicion, along with his university friendships of some of those who were involved in espionage. With the defection of [[Vasili Mitrokhin]] it was revealed that Klugmann was a [[KGB]] agent, under the codename MER, who was instrumental in recruiting the [[Cambridge Five]].&lt;ref&gt;The Mitrokhin Archive Vol.I pg. 82-85&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Klugmann gave up an academic career to become Secretary of the World Student Association, based in Paris, travelling widely across the world. This role, which involved the building of the [[Popular Front]] against fascism, first attracted the attention of the [[British Security Service]] (MI5). The Service's description of James for its operatives, which was put on file around 1938, said: "Height about {{cvt|5|ft|8|in|cm}}, light build, broad brow, small featured face, fuzz of greyish hair, probably wears glasses, not remarkably Jewish but rather foreign appearance."

In 1936 Klugmann met [[Arnold Deutsch]], the head of recruitment for [[NKVD]] agents based in England. Deutsch's main objective was to get Klugmann to help recruit John Cairncross as a spy. Klugmann became an important figure in the network. However, as he was known to the police as an active member of the Communist Party of Great Britain meant that he was not used as a spy. However, he was given the codename MAYOR and was used to compile reports on other agents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spartacus-educational.com/James_Klugmann.htm Biography of James Klugmann]&lt;/ref&gt;

Deutsch reported to Moscow: "Mayor (James Klugmann) is a party functionary who devotes himself entirely to the party. He is a quiet and thoughtful man. Modest, conscientious, industrious and serious. Everybody who knows him likes him and respects him…. He is known to the British police as an active communist. He is used to legal work and therefore incautious. But if his attention is drawn to this he will act as required." &lt;ref&gt;Arnold Deutsch, report on James Klugmann (April 1937)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in Yugoslavia with Special Operations==

He had joined the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] as a private in 1940 but, having a natural flair for languages, he was soon transferred to the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE), who apparently ignored his communist sympathies. It was claimed by the official historian of SOE that when Klugmann was recruited into SOE by Brigadier [[Terence Airey]] (an old boy of his school), [[MI5]] reported that he was not known to them. In fact, the relevant files had been destroyed at [[Wormwood Scrubs]] by a German air raid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Foot|first=M.R.D.|authorlink=M.R.D. Foot|title=The Special Operations Executive 1940–1946|publisher=Pimlico|year=1999|isbn=0-7126-6585-4|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1942 Klugmann was posted to the Yugoslav Section of SOE as an intelligence and coordination officer, based in [[Cairo]]. Klugmann became critical of the [[ Serbian royalty|Serb Royalist]] leader General [[Draza Mihailovic]], who was the chief beneficiary of British aid and support in the resistance movement in [[Yugoslavia]]. Klugmann's reports influenced thinking at the [[Political Warfare Executive]], Secret Intelligence Service (M16), the Foreign Office, and BBC.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} He suggested that the Communist leader [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] and his partisans were killing more Germans than Mihailovic's Cetniks despite smaller numbers.

[[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] switched his support to Tito (see [[Yugoslavia and the Allies]]). Some eight understrength Wehrmacht divisions and Bulgarian and Croatian [[Ustase]] units were employed in Yugoslavia during 1943 and 1944 fighting the partisans. Yugoslavia was the only country during [[World War II]] that liberated itself with little military assistance from the Allies. Although this move was one favoured by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], Tito and Stalin later fell out and became bitter critics. Klugmann rose to the rank of major, an unlikely outcome given his general disposition. He was under constant surveillance, suspected of being an [[NKVD]] agent along with [[Guy Burgess]], [[Donald Duart Maclean|Donald Maclean]] and [[Anthony Blunt]], all of whom he knew at Cambridge, and one of whom, Maclean, had been a friend at Gresham's. Proof of this was found in the KGBs archives and it is confirmed that John "James" Klugmann was a KGB talent-spotter and agent who was instrumental in recruiting the [[Cambridge Five]].&lt;ref&gt;The Mitrokhin Archive Vol.I pg.82-85&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in SOE and later whilst a civilian in UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) in Yugoslavia he supported Soviet aims.

==Post-war career==

Klugmann remained a devout Communist all his life and went on to play a significant role in the CPGB becoming responsible for the Education branch. After his wartime service, he became a member of the executive committee of the British Communist Party and editor of ''[[Marxism Today]]''. [[Michael Straight]] (later owner and editor of ''[[The New Republic]]'' and chairman of the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]), an American who had studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, and who had become friends there with Blunt, Kim Philby, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess described Klugmann as "a warm-hearted and compassionate intellectual whose commitment to Communism left him no time for such minor preoccupations as taking a bath or cleaning his fingernails."

One of the most active and overt British communists of his generation, Klugmann became an influential left-wing [[journalist]] after the war and wrote the first two volumes of the official ''History of the Communist Party of Great Britain'', which was continued by [[Noreen Branson]]. He also wrote the controversial ''From [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] to Tito'' justifying, to a British communist audience, policy towards Tito's [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

She is the ''New York Times'' bestselling author of several works of narrative [[nonfiction]] on art, design, and architecture.

==Biography==

Dupre was born in Providence, Rhode Island. She is the official biographer of [[One World Trade Center]]. Dupre is the author of the 2016 book titled ''One World Trade Center: Biography of the Building''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.onewtcbook.com|title=One WTC Book: Biography of the Building - Judith Dupré|last=|first=|date=|website=One WTC Book: Biography of the Building|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the only author given unfettered access to the Trade Center site, team, and archives by [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|The Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey]]. Dupré presents the story of the new World Trade Center in its entirety: from Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudy Giuliani']]s vow to rebuild on September 12, 2001, through the complex, often contentious interactions between multiple public and private agencies with a stake in the project, to the placing of One World Trade Center’s spire in 2013. The book incorporates over seventy interviews with major participants, including architects [[David Childs|David M. Childs]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Santiago Calatrava]], and [[Michael Arad]].

The suburb was located in the southern portion of the ancient city, situated between the Forum Colonnades of Herod and [[Taurus Mountains|Mt. Tauris]], a rocky crag at the foot of Mount Silpios.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reu.org/public/chrysos/life.txt – Section 32&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Antioch was erected around 300 BC by [[Seleucus I Nicator]].  After defeating the General Antigones and taking the city also called Antigones, Seleucus built a new city and named it after his Father Antiochos, a General who served under Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;''A Short History of Antioch'' (1921), Chapter 2, page 20&lt;/ref&gt; Seleucus then populated the city with Macedonians, Inhabitants of the recently conquered city, Antigones, and Jews. The Jewish population had a special, independent relationship with Seleucid dynasty and even had bronze plaques erected to codify their autonomous standing.&lt;ref&gt;''A Short History of Antioch'',  Chapter 5, page 105&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Glanville Downey, Kerateion was situated in the southern end of the city between the Cherubim Gate from the first century and the newer Daphne Gate on the bank of the torrent called Phyrminus (across from the present barracks). If this is correct the situation will be close to the present [[synagogue]] in the opposite direction of Mount Staurin where St. Peter's Grotto is located.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, G.: ''A History of Antioch in Syria'', Princeton 1961, p. 615&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19960">'''Loango Slavery Harbour''' is the [[republic of  the Congo]] cultural site included in World heritage Tentative Lists in 2008.

== Localisation ==
'''Loango Slavery Harbour''' is part of the Hinda district, in [[Kouilou Department|Kouilou department]]. This site is limited by:  [[Indienne, Congo|Pointe indienne]] to the Southeast, [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the South and to the Southwest, to the North-West the village of Matombi and to the northeast the small town of [[Diosso]], the former administrative district of Bwali, capital of the [[Kingdom of Loango]]. 

It is overlooked by the ancient lagoon of Tchibete that the relentless marine erosion has almost completely disappeared. Herbaceous vegetation is dominated by small-sized trees, with sandy soil influenced by the marine climate&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5373/|title=Ancien port d’embarquement des esclaves de Loango - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== History ==
From 1500 to 1867, under the impetus of the European trade powers, the largest transoceanic deportation company in human history has moved nearly 12.5 million African black slaves from the African coasts to the American coast.

It should be noted that despite its importance as a site of intercultural exchanges in the [[Modern history|modern world]] and its major contribution to the development of the [[Atlantic World|Atlantic world]] through the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]], the study of the coast of Loango did not have a lot of interest from scholarships. Phylis Martin is one of them&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/kongo/blog/posts/visual-archive-historian-perspective|title=The Visual Archive: A Historian's Perspective on Kongo and Loango Art|last=Windmuller-Luna|first=Kristen|date=2015-09-29|website=www.metmuseum.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

An interesting literature has existed since the years 1980. However, it focused on the southern part of the mouth of the [[Congo River]], namely [[Angola]], dominated by the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]]. Focusing on Portuguese activities and archives, these studies have obscured the operation of trade in the Loango coast, a kind of "free zone" where local, [[British Empire|British]], [[Kingdom of France|French]] and [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] merchants played a key role&lt;ref name="p8"&gt;Stacey Jean Muriel Sommerdyk, ''op. cit.'' p.8&lt;/ref&gt;.

If we combine the numbers of [[Central Africa]] (Angola and Loango) and those of the East Coast, we find that nearly 6.2 million of slaves (about half of the total) are from countries speaking [[Bantu languages]]. The different ports of Central Africa are:

* Loango coast
** [[Cabinda (city)|Cabinda]]
** Congo river mouth (Rio Zaïre), dividing line between Loango and the Angolan regions
** Kiloango
** Loango bay
** [[Malemba-Nkulu Territory|Malemba]]
** [[Mayumba, Gabon|Mayumba]]
** [[Mpinda]] on the southern bank of Congo river
* Angoan coast
** Ambona
** [[Ambriz]], just below Mpinda on the South on Loge river
** [[Benguela]]
** Benguela Velho (Old Benguela)
** [[Kwanza river]]
** Novo Redondo
** Quicombo
** Salinas
** [[Luanda]] (Saint Paul of Loanda), the largest port in [[Central Africa]] with about 1.4 million of embedded slaves.

Due to the number of captives passing through its site to the Americas, the former port of embarkation of Loango slaves is one of the most important in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. More than 2 million slaves from the areas that today constitute [[Chad]], [[Angola]], southern [[Gabon]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic republic of the Congo]] and the current territory of the [[Republic of the Congo]], would have transited through this site. 

=== Free Trade Area ===
Before 1660, the Europeans travelled to the coast of Loango to obtain supplies of fabrics, [[ivory]], rare wood ([[Aucoumea klaineana|okoume]], [[Pterocarpus|Padouk]]) and elephant tails. 

The fabrics particularly played an essential role in the everyday life of the inhabitants. In addition to their roles in furniture and clothing, the cloths were used in the ceremonies of induction, initiation and burial and also as a currency of exchange.

One of the important access points for foreign traders of the 17th century was the commercial port of the Bay of Loango, located about 10 km from Bwali, the capital of the kingdom of Loango. They were then escorted to Bwali in hopes of being granted an audience with the Maloango, or meeting with royal officials (Mafouk) to negotiate the terms of the exchange&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kongo: Power and Majesty|last=Martin|first=Phyllis|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=2015|isbn=|location=New York|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/kongo/blog/posts/the-path-they-trod|title=The Path They Trod: An Avenue of Mango Trees on the Loango Coast|last=Green|first=James|authorlink=|last2=Coleman|first2=Sylvan C.|date=December 11, 2015|website=www.metmuseum.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-12|last3=Pam|first3=Coleman}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In parallel, the Kingdom of Loango maintains trade with its neighbours from within. The access roads constituting this network are to the North the road to Mayumba, the [[Pool Malebo]] to the east and to Luanda to the south, passing through the kingdoms of [[Ngoyo]] and [[Kakongo]]. These are the famous [[Caravan route|caravan routes]].

From 1650, the influence of [[Raffia palm|raffia]] fabrics will decrease to the benefit of fabrics imported from [[Europe]] and the [[West Indies]]. The Dutch traders, newcomers to the coast of Loango, little interested in raffia, preferred to exchange [[Slavery|slaves]], ivory or [[copper]] in exchange for Western cloths and garments. These latest were quickly adopted by the notable Loango, in addition to the usual attributes such as leopard skins or other royal adornments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cloth and Currency on the Loango Coast|last=Martin|first=Phyllis M.|publisher=Indiana University|year=1986|isbn=|volume=XV|location=|pages=1-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1660 and 1867, the foreign trade in goods was definitively replaced by that of men. And it is the kingdom of Loango that sets the rules in its exchanges with the French, English or Dutch merchants, by making the competition between them. The merchants of Loango preferred their manufactured products compared to those of the Portuguese, as they found them to be better quality and cheaper.

When his interests are threatened, in particular by the Portuguese, the Kingdom does not hesitate to recall that he is a master on his territory and that he trades with whoever he pleases. To violate local rules was to take the risk of retaliation for the offender (death, or delay in supplying the ships with goods...)&lt;ref name="p85-87"&gt;Stacey Jean Muriel Sommerdyk, ''op. cit.'' p.85-87&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the meantime, during which the mechanisms of this long-running trade were established, at least 475 000 slaves integrated the triangular trade flows, from the ports of the Loango coast (Loango Bay , Malemba and Cabinda Bay)&lt;ref name="p7"&gt;Stacey Jean Muriel Sommerdyk, ''op. cit.'' p.7&lt;/ref&gt;..

1.3 million additional captives leaving the same ports were recorded between 1811 and 1867 on board Portuguese, [[Kingdom of Brazil|Brazilian]] and American ships. This makes the coast of Loango, one of the five most important African zones of [[triangular trade]].

=== Factories ===
The factories at that time corresponded no less to a [[warehouse]] than to a branch of the parent company, which the European trader used as outpost to store the goods disembarked from the boat, before selling them or storing the slaves in waiting for the trip to the Americas. However, suspicious of the Portuguese and their role in the destabilization of their mighty neighbor, the [[kingdom of Kongo]], from the forts installed along the Angolan coast, the Kingdom of Loango did not accept permanent installation of Factory&lt;ref name="p87"&gt;Stacey Jean Muriel Sommerdyk, ''op. cit.'' p.87&lt;/ref&gt;.

Unless, between 1608 and 1612, thanks to the interpersonal skills of [[Pieter van den Broecke]], Dutch merchants installed factories in Mayumba and on Loango Bay to provide copper and ivory spikes.&lt;ref name="p88"&gt;Stacey Jean Muriel Sommerdyk, ''op. cit.'' p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of Dutch competition, in 1624, Souza, the Portuguese governor of Luanda, asked the Maloango to close the competing factories. and expel these heretics. On the other hand, the governor promises to buy all the stocks of ivory and copper, to provide better quality products, to ensure his protection in the event of an enemy invasion and finally to send [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priests to baptize the Ma Loango. The latter strongly retorted that he would continue to trade with both parties under the same conditions and that he had no intention of converting to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]].

Thus, the Loango remained in control of its territorial integrity by controlling its economic relations, religious with the Atlantic powers. With its political and economic ascent, the area of influence of the Loango extended northward. At the end of the seventeenth century, with the disparting of the Kingdom of Kongo, the Loango also extended its influence towards the south by inaugurating a new model of road networks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Central Africa to 1870: Zambezia, Zaïre and the South Atlantic|last=Birmingham|first=David|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1981|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Nowadays ==
The historic site abandoned, seems interested neither the Congolese in general, nor the people from [[Pointe-Noire]] in particular.

Over the years he has perpetuated, with modest means, the memory of this place which has become the sanctuary of wild vegetation.

The port still keeps the remains of the transatlantic trade, which led to one of the greatest genocides of mankind:

* A stele erected in 1897 by the French explorer [[Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza]], symbolizing materially the location of the caravans ' departure and, at the same time, the large market of all transactions. The stele of about 7 meters high, or at least what's left of it, lost in the tall grass, collapsed alone in February 2002, for lack of maintenance&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aa.com.tr/fr/afrique/congo-de-l-ancien-port-dembarquement-des-esclaves-de-loango-il-ne-reste-que-des-vestiges-/847292|title=Congo: De l’ancien port d'embarquement des esclaves de Loango, il ne reste que des vestiges|last=Jerbia|first=Slim|date=2017-06-12|work=Anadolu Agency|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

* The three mango trees that served as counters before the ritual around the tree of oblivion.

* The tree for the ritual of oblivion and the one for the return: The slaves chained, made seven laps of this tree for women or young girls, and nine laps for men. The return tree symbolized a possible return of the spirit of the deceased to Loango when he died in the Americas;

* The jetty, which was a mudflat, served by a grass-filled runway, remains represented by a calm portion that resists marine erosion. In fact, the shallow Loango Bay did not allow boats to dock. They were throwing the anchor 30 kilometers offshore.

* The double row of mango trees 30 meters high about, three centuries old, delimiting the last path trodden by the captives in their final approach to the Atlantic Ocean. This road runs along the ridge of a hill and turns abruptly towards the Atlantic, so that the approach to the sea is done in a straight line and ends on the side of cliffs before the ocean&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

It should be noted that [[Mangifera indica|mango trees]] (''Mangifera indica L.'') are a powerful symbol of the slave trade. In fact, these trees were first transported to Central and western Africa in the cargo of Portuguese ships of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries from their original domestication centres, [[India]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. The arrival of Mango in Africa, and then in Brazil, was part of a world trade of exotic fruits that included [[pineapple]] (''Ananas comosus''), banana (''Musa''), [[guava]] (''Psidium Guajava''), to name but a few examples&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

From the point of view of tradition, Father Raphael Nzaou, the head of the Catholic mission of [[Loango, Republic of Congo|Loango]] provides two explanations on the symbolic and origin of these mango trees. In the first, it describes how the slaves, in their march to the coast, have dropped the nuclei of mangoes which then turned into mango trees along the way. Mangoes thus symbolized their last African meal before they left for the Americas, which was under the understanding as a death. In the second explanation, the abbot tells how those who had remained on the land of Loango, planted a mango tree as a memorial of the missing near. He adds that, always nowadays, it is common to plant a tree on the funeral site of a deceased person&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

In addition, the historical and emotional burden of this site is always noticeable. It is indeed the place where there are always several rites of induction and funeral of the Mâ Loango, the kings of the Kingdom of Loango.

The cultural importance of this site is also noticeable through the laments always sung by the inhabitants who remained on this sinister place, recalling the nostalgia of the descendants, remained to wait for loved ones torn from their affection and that they will never see again. Thus, the former port of embarkation, which has become a veritable sanctuary for its historical burden, is a key link for understanding the history of slavery&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

== World heritage tentative list ==
On 12th June 2008, the site was included in the tentaive list of world cultural heritage&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and is part of the Unesco [[The Slave Route Project|Slave Route Project.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esclavage-memoire.com/lieux-de-memoire/musee-regional-des-arts-traditions-de-ma-loango-diosso-pointe-noire-au-congo-48.html|title=MUSÉE RÉGIONAL DES ARTS &amp; TRADITIONS DE MÂ LOANGO, Diosso, Pointe-Noire au Congo|last=Hexalogic|first=Benjamin Abbou -|website=www.esclavage-memoire.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, almost nothing has been done to highlight this vestige, like the [[Gorée|island of Gorée]] in [[Senegal]] or [[Ouidah|Ouiddah]] in [[Benin]]. This makes more than one visitor shocked by this state of abandonment.

Samuel Mabandza, departmental director of heritage in the Department of Kouilou, assures that "the Congolese state is not insensitive to this situation". He adds that "it is planned to build an African city of arts surrounded by museums in the open air, in order to enhance the old port of embarkation of slaves." An action that will also benefit local communities",&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; he confides, without providing more details as to the deadlines for carrying out the project.

'''Matthew Paris''', known as '''Matthew of Paris''' (Latin: ''Matthæus Parisiensis'', {{small|lit.}} "Matthew the Parisian";&lt;ref&gt;[[John Allen Giles]] (translator), ''Matthew Paris' English history, from 1235 to 1273'', Publ. 1852. ([https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6DwIAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22matthew%20paris%22%20engraving&amp;pg=PR5#v=onepage&amp;q=matthew%20paris&amp;f=false page v])&lt;/ref&gt; c. 1200 – 1259), was a [[Benedictine]] monk, [[English historians in the Middle Ages|English chronicler]], artist in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[cartographer]], based at [[St Albans Cathedral|St Albans Abbey]] in [[Hertfordshire]]. He wrote a number of works, mostly historical, which he scribed and illuminated himself, typically in drawings partly coloured with [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]] washes, sometimes called "tinted drawings". Some were written in [[Latin]], some in [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] or [[Old French|French]] verse.

His ''[[Chronica Majora]]'' is an oft-cited source, though modern historians recognise that Paris was not always reliable.  He tended to glorify Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and denigrate the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jackson, ''Mongols and the West'', p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his ''Historia Anglorum'', Paris displays a highly negative view of Frederick, going as far as to describe him as a "tyrant" who "committed disgraceful crimes".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Paris, 'Matthew Paris on Staufer Italy'. In Jessalyn Bird, Edward Peters, and James M. Powell, ''Crusade and Christendom: Annotated Documents in Translation from Innocent III to the Fall of Acre, 1187-1291'', p.405&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
In spite of his surname and knowledge of the French language, Paris was of English birth, and is believed by some chroniclers to be of the Paris family of [[Hildersham]], [[Cambridgeshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The history of the county of Cambridge|author=[[Edmund Carter (topographer)|Edmund Carter]]|year=1819|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QTQQAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He may have studied at Paris in his youth after early education at [[St Albans School, Hertfordshire|St Albans School]]. The first we know of Matthew Paris (from his own writings) is that he was admitted as a monk to [[St Albans Cathedral|St Albans]] in 1217. It is on the assumption that he was in his teens on admission that his birth date is estimated; some scholars suspect he may have been ten years or more older; many monks only entered monastic life after pursuing a career in the world outside.  He was clearly at ease with the nobility and even royalty, which may indicate that he came from a family of some status, although it also seems an indication of his personality. His life was mainly spent in this religious house. In 1248, Paris was sent to [[medieval Norway|Norway]] as the bearer of a message from [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] to [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon IV]]; he made himself so agreeable to the Norwegian sovereign that he was invited to superintend the reformation of the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Nidarholm Abbey]] outside [[Trondheim]].

Apart from these missions, his known activities were devoted to the composition of history, a pursuit for which the monks of St Albans had long been famous. After admission to the order in 1217, he inherited the mantle of [[Roger of Wendover]], the abbey's official recorder of events, in 1236.  Paris revised Roger's work, adding new material to cover his own tenure.  This ''[[Chronica Majora]]'' is an important historical source document, especially for the period between 1235 and 1259.  Equally interesting are the illustrations Paris created for his work.

The Dublin MS (see below) contains interesting notes, which shed light on Paris' involvement in other manuscripts, and on the way his own were used. They are in French and in his handwriting:
*"If you please you can keep this book till Easter"
*"G, please send to the Lady Countess of Arundel, Isabel, that she is to send you the book about [[Thomas Becket|St Thomas the Martyr]] and [[Edward the Confessor|St Edward]] which I copied (translated?) and illustrated, and which the Lady [[Cornwall|Countess of Cornwall]] may keep until [[Whitsun]]tide"
* some verses
* "In the Countess of Winchester's book let there be a pair of images on each page thus": (verses follow describing thirteen saints)

It is presumed the last relates to Paris acting as commissioning agent and iconographical consultant for the Countess with another artist.

The lending of his manuscripts to aristocratic households, apparently for periods of weeks or months at a time, suggests why he made several different illustrated versions of his Chronicle.

Paris' manuscripts mostly contain more than one text, and often begin with a rather random assortment of prefatory full-page miniatures.  Some have survived incomplete, and the various elements now bound together may not have been intended to be so by Paris.  Unless stated otherwise, all were given by Paris to his monastery (from some inscriptions it seems they were regarded as his property to dispose of).

His major historical work (see below), but less heavily illustrated per page than others.&lt;ref&gt;http://parkerweb.stanford.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; These two volumes contain annals from the creation of the world up to the year 1253.  The content up to 1234 or 1235 is based in the main on Roger of Wendover's ''Flores Historiarum'', with additions; after that date the material is Paris' own, and written in his own hand from the annal for 1213 onward.  There are 100 marginal drawings (25 + 75), some fragmentary maps and an itinerary, and full-page drawings of [[William I of England|William I]] and the Elephant with Keeper. MS 16 has very recently had all prefatory matter re-bound separately.&lt;ref group=c&gt;{{commons category-inline|Chronica Majora part 1 (Matthew Paris) - Parker MS 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=c&gt;{{commons category-inline|Chronica Majora part 2 (Matthew Paris) - Parker MS 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Flores Historiarum]]''. [[Chetham's Library|Chetham's Hospital and Library, Manchester]], MS 6712. Only part of the text, covering 1241 to 1249, is in Paris' hand, though he is credited with the authorship of the whole text, which is an abridgement of the ''Chronica'' with additions from the annals of Reading and of Southwark.  Additional interpolations to the text make it clear the volume was created for [[Westminster Abbey]]. It was apparently started there, copying another MS of Paris' text that went up to 1240.  Later it was sent back to the author for him to update; Vaughan argues this was in 1251-2.  The illustrations are similar to Paris' style but not by him. Later additions took the chronicle up to 1327.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Morgan in: Jonathan Alexander &amp; Paul Binski (eds), ''Age of Chivalry, Art in Plantagenet England, 1200–1400'', Royal Academy/Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London 1987, Cat 437&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=c&gt;{{commons category-inline|Flores Historiarum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A history of England, begun in 1250 and perhaps completed around 1255, covering the years 1070–1253.  The text is an abridgement of the ''Chronica'', also drawing on Wendover's ''Flores Historiarum'' and Paris' earlier edited version of the ''Chronica''.  Bound with it is the final part of Paris' ''Chronica Majora'', covering the years 1254–1259 (folios 157–218), and prefatory material including an itinerary from London to Jerusalem and tinted drawings of the kings of England. All is in Paris' own hand, apart from folios 210–218 and 154v-156v, which are in a hand of the scribe who has added a note of Matthew Paris' death (f. 218v).  The ''Chronica'' concludes with a portrait of Paris on his death-bed, presumably not by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibs001.colo.firstnet.net.uk/britishlibrary/controller/subjectidsearch?id%3D11624%26%26idx%3D1%26startid%3D12427 |accessdate=7 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050429145604/http://ibs001.colo.firstnet.net.uk/britishlibrary/controller/subjectidsearch?id=11624 |archivedate=29 April 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 15th century this volume belonged to [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]], son of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], who inscribed it "Ceste livre est a moy Homffrey Duc de Gloucestre".

Vaughan had previously noted that the leaves from the ''Life of St Thomas'' and the ''Life of King Edward'' are of different sizes, and written by different scribes, neither of them Paris himself, so they are not likely to be part of the manuscript that Paris wrote of having lent to the Countess of Arundel; but that, "to judge from the script and the style of illumination" they are "very close copies of Matthew [Paris]'s original".&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn (1958), ''Matthew Paris'', p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=c&gt;{{commons category-inline|The Becket Leaves (c.1220-1240) - BL Loan MS 88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A panel painting on oak of [[Saint Peter|St Peter]], the only surviving part of a [[church tabernacle|tabernacle]] shrine (1850 x 750&amp;nbsp;mm), in the Museum of [[University of Oslo|Oslo University]] has been attributed to Paris, presumably dating from his visit in 1248. Local paintings are usually on pine, so he may have brought this with him, or sent it later.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Morgan in: Jonathan Alexander &amp; Paul Binski (eds), ''Age of Chivalry, Art in Plantagenet England, 1200–1400'', Royal Academy/Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London 1987, Cat 311&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paris as an artist==
[[File:DublinTrinityCollegeMSEi40LifeAlbanFol38vHeracliusTakesDownAlbansHead.jpg|thumb|Framed tinted drawing of Heraclius taking down the head of Saint Alban, from the [[Trinity College, Dublin]] ''Life'']]
In some of Paris' manuscripts, a framed miniature occupies the upper half of the page, and in others they are "marginal" – unframed and occupying the bottom quarter (approximately) of the page. Tinted drawings were an established style well before Paris, and became especially popular in the first half of the 13th century.  They were certainly much cheaper and quicker than fully painted illuminations.  The tradition of tinted drawings or outline drawings with ink supplemented by coloured wash was distinctively English, dating back to the [[Anglo-Saxon art]] of the mid-10th century, and connected with the [[English Benedictine Reform]] of the period. A strong influence on one branch of the style was the Carolingian [[Utrecht Psalter]], which was at [[Canterbury]] from about 1000 to 1640.  This was copied in the 1020s in the [[Harley Psalter]], and in the [[Eadwine Psalter]] of the mid-12th century. 

Recent scholarship, notably that of Nigel Morgan, suggests that Paris' influence on other artists of the period has been exaggerated.  This is likely because so much more is known about him than other English illuminators of the period, who are mostly anonymous.  Most manuscripts seem to have been produced by lay artists in this period.  [[William de Brailes]] is shown with a clerical tonsure, but he was married, which suggests he had minor orders only.  The manuscripts produced by Paris show few signs of collaboration, but art historians detect a School of St Albans' surviving after Paris' death, influenced by him.

[[File:Matthew Paris - William Marshal.jpg|thumb|Unframed marginal drawing of [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshal]] from the [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus Christi College]] ''Chronica'']]
Paris' style suggests that it was formed by works from around 1200.  He was somewhat old-fashioned in retaining a roundness in his figures, rather than adopting the thin angularity of most of his artist contemporaries, especially those in London.  His compositions are very inventive; his position as a well-connected monk may have given him more confidence in creating new compositions, whereas a lay artist would prefer to stick to traditional formulae.  It may also reflect the lack of full training in the art of the period.  His colouring emphasises green and blue, and together with his characteristic layout of a picture in the top half of a page, is relatively distinctive. What are probably his final sketches are found in ''[[Vitae duorum Offarum]]'' in BL MS Cotton Nero D I.

==Paris as a historian==
From 1235, the point at which [[Roger of Wendover|Wendover]] dropped his pen, Paris continued the history on the plan which his predecessors had followed. He derived much of his information from the letters of important people, which he sometimes inserts, but much more from conversation with the eyewitnesses of events.  Among his informants were [[Richard, Earl of Cornwall]] and King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], with whom he appears to have been on intimate terms.

The king knew that Paris was writing a history, and wanted it to be as exact as possible. In 1257, in the course of a week's visit to St Albans, Henry kept the chronicler beside him night and day, "and guided my pen," says Paris, "with much goodwill and diligence."  It is curious that the ''Chronica majora'' gives so unfavourable an account of the king's policy.  [[Henry Richards Luard]] supposes that Paris never intended his work to be read in its present form.  Many passages of the autograph have written next to them, the ''note offendiculum'', which shows that the writer understood the danger which he ran. On the other hand, unexpurgated copies were made in Paris's lifetime.  Although the offending passages are duly omitted or softened in his abridgment of his longer work, the ''[[Historia Anglorum (Matthew Paris)|Historia Anglorum]]'' (written about 1253), Paris's real feelings must have been an open secret.  There is no ground for the old theory{{cn|date=November 2016}} that he was an official historiographer.
[[File:Paris.elefant.jpg|thumb|Another elephant from the ''Chronica Maiora'' II, [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]].]]

Naturalists have praised his descriptions of the English  wildlife of his time,  brief though they are: in particular his valuable description of the first [[bird migration|irruption]] into England in 1254 of the [[common crossbill]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Richard  ''Wildlife in Britain and Ireland'' Croom Helm Ltd London 1978 p.134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies of Matthew Paris==
The relation of Matthew Paris's work to those of John de Celia ([[John of Wallingford (d. 1214)|John of Wallingford]]) and [[Roger of Wendover]] may be studied in [[Henry Richards Luard]]'s edition of the ''Chronica majora'' (7 vols., [[Rolls series]], 1872–1881), which contains valuable prefaces. The ''Historia Anglorum sive historia minor'' (1067–1253) has been edited by [[Frederic Madden]] (3 vols., Rolls series, 1866–1869).

Matthew Paris is sometimes confused with [[Matthew of Westminster]], the reputed author of the ''[[Flores historiarum]]'' edited by Luard (3 vols., Rolls series, 1890). This work, compiled by various hands, is an edition of Matthew Paris, with continuations extending to 1326.

He wrote a life of [[Edmund of Abingdon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lawrence|first1=C. H.|title=The life of St. Edmund by Matthew Paris|date=1996|publisher=Alan Sutton|location=Oxford|isbn=0-7509-1129-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''La Estoire de Seint Aedward le Rei'' (the History of Saint Edward the King), which survives in a beautifully illuminated manuscript version, Cambridge, [[Cambridge University Library]] MS. Ee.3.59.&lt;ref name="paris life"/&gt; The text is edited in K.Y. Wallace, ''La Estoire de Seint Aedward le Rei'', Anglo-Norman Text Society 41 (1983).

Paris House at [[St Albans High School for Girls]] is named after him.

'''Michael F. Scheuer''' (born 1952)&lt;ref name="Micheal Scheuer NNDB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/132/000098835/ |title=Michael Scheuer |publisher=Nndb.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a former intelligence officer for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], American [[blog]]ger, author, foreign policy critic, and political analyst. He was an [[adjunct professor]] at [[Georgetown University]]'s Center for Peace and Security Studies. One of his assignments during his 22-year career was serving as Chief of the [[Bin Laden Issue Station]] (aka "Alec Station") (the [[Osama bin Laden]] tracking unit at the [[Counterterrorism Center]]) from 1996 to 1999. He also served as Special Advisor to the Chief of Alec Station from September 2001 to November 2004.

Scheuer became a public figure after being outed as the anonymous author of the 2004 book ''[[Imperial Hubris]],'' in which he criticized many of the [[United States]]' assumptions about [[Islamism|Islamist]] insurgencies and particularly [[Osama bin Laden]]. Later in 2004, shortly after the 'outing' of Scheuer's harsh criticism of [[Israel–United States relations|America's close alliance with Israel]], Scheuer resigned from his position at the CIA. In his book Scheuer depicted bin Laden as a rational actor who was fighting to weaken the United States by weakening its economy, rather than merely combating and killing Americans.

Scheuer challenges the common assumption that terrorism is the threat facing the United States in the modern era, arguing rather that Islamist insurgency (and not "terrorism")&lt;ref name=ih253&gt;''Imperial Hubris''. p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; is the core of the conflict between the U.S. and Islamist forces, who in places such as [[Kashmir]], [[Xinjiang]], and [[Chechnya]] are "struggling not just for independence but against institutionalized barbarism."&lt;ref name=ih253 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Ali Khan. ''A theory of international terrorism''. 2006, pp. 243–44&lt;/ref&gt; Osama bin Laden acknowledged the book in a 2007 statement, suggesting that it revealed "the reasons for your losing the war against us".&lt;ref name=sep7&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/transcript2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14248784 |title=CIA Chief Says Al-Qaida is Plotting Attack on U.S. |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=September 7, 2007 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, Scheuer reported that, as a consequence of his statements about US foreign policy towards Israel, he had been fired from his position as a senior fellow of the [[Jamestown Foundation]] by Jamestown's president.&lt;ref name=fired/&gt; In December 2013 and January 2014, Scheuer was criticized for seeming to advise American citizens to seriously consider assassinating US President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/01/03/foxs-benghazi-expert-endorsed-assassinating-oba/197411 Fox News Benghazi Expert Endorsed Assassinating Obama Last Week]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, in addition to earlier "praise" received from [[Al-Qaeda]], the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] issued a press release quoting Scheuer in order to appeal to an American audience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/09/isis-releases-second-hostage-hosted-propaganda-video/380647/ ISIS Releases a Second Hostage-Hosted Propaganda Video]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/islamic-state-video-british-hostage-john-cantlie-isis Islamic State posts video showing British hostage John Cantlie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/bin-laden-documents-released-al-qaeda-leader-was-reading-noam-chomsky-and-911-conspiracy-theories-10264182.html Bin Laden documents released: Al-Qaeda leader was reading Noam Chomsky and 9/11 conspiracy theories inside Abbottabad compound, say US officials]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Marching Toward Hell''.&lt;/ref&gt; He is now known to have been the anonymous author of both the 2004 book ''[[Imperial Hubris|Imperial Hubris: Why the West is Losing the War on Terror]]'' and the earlier anonymous work, ''Through Our Enemies' Eyes: Osama bin Laden, Radical Islam, and the Future of America''.&lt;ref&gt;The authorship of these books is now widely known, and advertised as such.

According to bin Laden, "If you want to understand what's going on and if you would like to get to know some of the reasons for your losing the war against us, then read the book of Michael Scheuer in this regard."&lt;ref name=sep7 /&gt;

After leaving the CIA in 2004, Scheuer worked as a news analyst for [[CBS News]] and a terrorism analyst for [[The Jamestown Foundation]]'s online publication ''Global Terrorism Analysis.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://jamestown.org/terrorism/ Global Terrorism Analysis].&lt;/ref&gt; He also makes radio and television appearances and teaches a [[graduate school|graduate-level]] course on [[Al-Qaeda]] at [[Georgetown University]]. He also participates in conferences on terrorism and [[national security]] issues, such as the [[New America Foundation]]'s December 2004 conference, "Al Qaeda 2.0: Transnational Terrorism After 9/11."&lt;ref&gt;

In 2009, Scheuer reported that he had lost his position as a Senior Fellow with the Jamestown Foundation, after "several major financial donors to Jamestown threatened to withdraw funding" if he continued in that role.&lt;ref name=fired&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.antiwar.com/scheuer/?articleid=14221 |title=Lobby? What Lobby? – by Michael Scheuer |publisher=Antiwar.com |date=2009-02-10 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funding threats were pursuant to his criticism of Barack Obama's "dancing the Tel Aviv two-step" in allegedly kowtowing to the [[Israel lobby in the United States|Israeli lobby]], as well as Scheuer's disdaining of Obama's selection as Chief of Staff of [[Rahm Emanuel]], "a U.S. citizen who during the 1991 Gulf War left America to serve in Israel's military."&lt;ref name=fired /&gt;

Scheuer's book, ''Marching Toward Hell: America and Islam After Iraq'' was published on February 12, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Find Out What S&amp;S Authors Are Doing Right Now |url=http://authors.simonandschuster.com/Michael-Scheuer/39243089 |title=Michael Scheuer &amp;#124; Official Publisher Page |publisher=Authors.simonandschuster.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

===''Through Our Enemies' Eyes''===
His first book, published anonymously, is an analysis of the public discourse available on al Qaeda's ideology and strategy. In it, Scheuer explores the bin Laden phenomenon and its implications for U.S. security. He began the book in 1999 as an unclassified manual for counterterrorism officers. Due to the secrecy agreement he signed as an employee of the CIA, the book is based solely on unclassified intelligence or material available from open sources such as media reports. His main thesis in the work is that the view of bin Laden as a lunatic is a form of "[[myopia]]" that limits Western military thinkers' ability to respond to the bin Laden phenomenon. He writes that "the West's road to hell lies in approaching the bin Laden problem with the presumption that only the lunatic fringe could oppose what the United States is trying to accomplish through its foreign policy toward the Muslim world. Bin Laden's philosophy is slowly harnessing the two most powerful motivating forces in contemporary international affairs: religion and nationalism."&lt;ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;27).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he crux of my argument is simply that America is in a war with militant Islamists that it cannot avoid; one that it cannot talk or appease its way out of; one in which our irreconcilable Islamist foes will have to be killed, an act which unavoidably will lead to innocent deaths; and one that is motivated in large measure by the impact of U.S. foreign policies in the Islamic world, one of which is unqualified U.S. support for Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=031805E |title=On 'Michael Scheuer's Bloody Logic' – Thanks, and a Comment from Scheuer |publisher=TCS Daily |date=2005-03-18 |accessdate=2010-08-27 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Imperial Hubris''===
{{Main|Imperial Hubris}}
In his second book, ''Imperial Hubris'', a [[New York Times bestseller list|New York Times bestseller]], Scheuer writes that the Islamist threat to the United States is rooted in "how easy it is for Muslims to see, hear, experience, and hate the six U.S. policies bin Laden repeatedly refers to as anti-Muslim:
* U.S. support for apostate, corrupt, and tyrannical Muslim governments.
* U.S. and other Western troops on the Arabian Peninsula.
* U.S. support for Israel that keeps Palestinians in the Israelis' thrall.
* U.S. pressure on Arab energy producers to keep oil prices low.
* U.S. occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan.
* U.S. support for Russia, India, and China against their Muslim militants."&lt;ref&gt;Imperial Hubris, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

Scheuer contends that Al Qaeda is following a martial strategy that is more rational than it is given credit for among Western politicians and media. He cites [[Clausewitz]]'s dictum that one must strike one's enemy's "center of gravity", and pairs it with an al Qaeda writer's assertion that "the American economy is the American center of gravity".&lt;ref&gt;''Imperial Hubris''. p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In a videotape released around September 7, 2007, Osama bin Laden stated, "If you want to understand what's going on and if you would like to get to know some of the reasons for your losing the war against us, then read the book of Michael Scheuer."&lt;ref name=sep7 /&gt;

===''Marching Toward Hell''===
Released in 2008, ''Marching Toward Hell: America and Islam After Iraq'' how the 2003 [[Iraq War]] has affected [[Al-Qaeda]] and the United States. He argues that the instability in the Iraq War has benefited Al-Qaeda without serving any U.S. interests.

=== Works on the Islamic State ===
Scheuer penned an article advocating non-interventionism against the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]. He maintained that Islamic State is stronger militarily than the Obama administration believes in several key regions: 1) the Balkans; 2) Libya; 3) Afghanistan; and 4) certain "maritime chokepoints." The only remaining option, according to Scheuer, is to abandon interventionist policies and allow Sunni Islam to establish an international caliphate, while defending the United States alone. The Islamic State reprinted Scheuer's article in its entirety in the 11th issue of its propaganda magazine ''[[Dabiq (magazine)|Dabiq]]'' in a section named "In the words of the enemy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.clarionproject.org/docs/Issue%2011%20-%20From%20the%20battle%20of%20Al-Ahzab%20to%20the%20war%20of%20coalitions.pdf|title = Dabiq, issue 11|date = |accessdate = 5 October 2015|website = Clarion Project|publisher = Islamic State|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==

===War on Terror===
Scheuer's views emphasized the danger of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, as well as the ineffectiveness of U.S. policy against these imminent threats. The threat to the United States, Scheuer has consistently maintained, continues to grow, and the U.S. continually fails to grasp the nature of the struggle in which it is engaged:&lt;ref&gt;''Imperial Hubris''. p. 262–63&lt;/ref&gt; Islamist and anti-American sentiment continue to grow around the world, and the bin Laden movement is aimed, not at killing or conquering Americans or reforming their internal political systems, but rather bankrupting them in order to reduce their worldwide influence and thereby liberate Muslims from the yoke of American political, military, and financial influence. The failure of the U.S. to apprehend this threat is, in part, rooted in a misunderstanding and underestimation of Osama bin Laden himself. To Scheuer, Osama bin Laden's "beliefs, goals, and intentions" were

&lt;blockquote&gt;carefully chosen, plainly spoken, and precise. He has set out the Muslim world's problems as he sees them; determined that they are caused by the United States; explained why they must be remedied; and outlined how he will try to do so. Seldom in America's history has an enemy laid out so clearly the basis for the war he is waging against it.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scheuer's criticism of U.S. foreign policy includes a sweeping condemnation of the invasion of Iraq, which he has characterized as a "Christmas present" to Osama bin Laden's Islamist recruitment efforts, and a validation of bin Laden's claims that the U.S. is at war with Islam. From his personal involvement in background research in the run up to the war, Scheuer states that "there was no connection between [Al Qaeda] and Saddam."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/darkside/interviews/scheuer.html The Dark Side], PBS ''Frontline'' interview, 22 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. rhetoric about bin Laden having allegedly "hat[ed] freedom" has also irked Scheuer, who suggests that those "willing to give their lives to destroy the dictatorship in Saudi Arabia ... must want freedom in some kind of way."&lt;ref&gt;Al-Jazeera TV on September 11 and 12, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This erroneous rhetoric, according to Scheuer, is not only to be found in the media and among politicians, but even in the [[9/11 Commission report]], in which bin Laden and his followers were identified "as takfiris, who kill Muslims if they don't agree with them. They're not takfiris. They're just very devout, severe Salafists and Wahhabis."

The insistence on referring to al Qaeda and the Islamist movement around it as a terrorist group or terrorist movement has also been a mistake, according to Scheuer. The U.S. is faced with an insurgency, rather than mere terrorism.

Speaking on the BBC News on November 9, 2012, Scheuer criticized what he called the Obama administration's deceit about the threat from Islamic militants, and misleading the American people in his first administration by claiming that the word "jihad" had nothing to do with military affairs, and that it had to do with "self reform and community improvement", which Scheuer claims was a blatant lie.

===Clinton and Bush administrations===
Scheuer has been critical of the Bush and Clinton administrations for not having killed bin Laden, for costly and disastrous policy missteps, and for not taking decisive measures to defend the country. He states that Clinton had eight to ten opportunities to kill bin Laden prior to September 11, and Bush had one opportunity thereafter. [[Richard A. Clarke]] and the Clinton administration, according to Scheuer, thwarted the CIA's ambitions to kidnap or kill bin Laden when they had the chance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washtimes.com/op-ed/20060704-110004-4280r.htm], Washington Times Guest Editorial, July 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Scheuer,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Clarke's book ''Against All Enemies'' is also a crucial complement to the September 11 panel's failure to condemn Mr. Clinton's failure to capture or kill bin Laden on any of the eight to 10 chances afforded by CIA reporting. Mr. Clarke never mentions that President Bush had no chances to kill bin Laden before September 11 and leaves readers with the false impression that he, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, did their best to end the bin Laden threat. That trio, in my view, abetted al Qaeda, and if the September 11 families were smart they would focus on the dereliction of Dick [Clarke], Bill [Clinton] and Sandy [Berger] and not the antics of convicted September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui.&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Scheuer, "[http://www.washingtontimes.com/op-ed/20060704-110004-4280r.htm Bill and Dick, Osama and Sandy]," ''Washington Times'' (5 July 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of the Bush administration, Scheuer warns against assigning it full responsibility for the nation's troubles since September 11, 2001. Although the "unprovoked attack of Iraq" will forever be remembered as "infamous", as will [[Dick Cheney]]'s "reptilian contention that Americans who criticize U.S. foreign policy are 'validating the strategy of the terrorists'," according to Scheuer, a "bipartisan governing elite", both Democratic and Republican, is to blame for the nation's woes.&lt;ref name=mth&gt;''Marching Toward Hell'', p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; (Notwithstanding the bipartisan responsibility, Scheuer comments, "the thought of what history will say about Donald Rumsfeld's tenure at the Department of Defense ought to make his relatives shudder down to their latest generation.")&lt;ref name=mth /&gt;

===Pending threats===
In 2007, Scheuer said "The Iranians are no threat to the United States unless we provoke them. They may be a threat to the Israelis. They‘re not a threat to the United States. The threat to the United States, inside the United States, comes from al Qaeda....These people are going to detonate a nuclear device inside the United States, and we're going to have absolutely nothing to respond against."&lt;ref name=nbc-20070220&gt;{{cite news|title='Countdown with Keith Olbermann' for Feb. 19|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17240518#.ULSBgeSbOV8|newspaper=NBCNEWS|date=20 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel and the Lobby===
Scheuer has stated that the Mearsheimer and Walt paper ''[[The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy]]'' is essentially correct. Israel, according to Scheuer, has engaged in one of the most successful campaigns to influence public opinion in the United States ever conducted by a foreign government. Scheuer said to NPR that "They [Mearsheimer and Walt] should be credited for the courage they have had to actually present a paper on the subject. I hope they move on and do the Saudi lobby, which is probably more dangerous to the United States than the Israeli lobby."&lt;ref&gt;Amos, Deborah. [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5353855 "Paper on Israel Lobby Sparks Heated Debate"], ''[[Morning Edition]]'', [[NPR]], April 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Marching Toward Hell'', Scheuer laments "the war in Iraq that was instigated by U.S. citizen Israel-firsters and their evangelical Christian allies".&lt;ref&gt;''Marching Toward Hell'' p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; He continues,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Because both U.S. political parties are wholly owned subsidiaries of the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and the Israeli government, there is no large-scale U.S. military withdrawal from Iraq in the cards... If you doubt this, keep in mind the name [[Rahm Emanuel]]. Slated to be the president-elect's chief of staff, Mr. Emanuel has labored as a volunteer for AIPAC's various anti-U.S. causes, strove to ensure the defeat of anti-Iraq War Democratic congressional candidates in 2006, and in 1991, as a 32-year-old U.S. citizen, chose to serve with the Israeli Defense Forces rather than volunteer to fight for the United States in the war against Saddam's Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;''Marching Toward Hell'' p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Doha Debates===
In April 2009, Scheuer participated in the [[Doha Debates]] at [[Georgetown University]], where he debated for the motion "This house believes that it is time for the USA to get tough on Israel" with fellow speaker [[Avraham Burg]]. Speakers against the motion were [[Dore Gold]] and [[Alan Dershowitz]]. Burg and Scheuer won the debate, with 63% of the audience voting for the motion. During the debate, Scheuer suggested that "the war in Iraq is the responsibility of the American fifth column that supports Israel" and accused Dershowitz of being part of this "fifth column". Dershowitz responded that he opposed the war in Iraq, that "more Jews than any other ethnic group in America opposed the war in Iraq" and that Scheuer was engaging in "bigotry."&lt;ref name="TheDohaDebates"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedohadebates.com/debates/debate.asp?d=48&amp;s=5&amp;mode=transcript |title=This House believes it's time for the US to get tough on Israel – Transcript |date=2009-03-25 |publisher=The Doha Debates |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803205352/http://www.thedohadebates.com/debates/debate.asp?d=48&amp;s=5&amp;mode=transcript |archivedate=2009-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq and al-Qaeda===
Thomas Joscelyn of ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' wrote a critical piece on Scheuer and an interview Scheuer did on [[Chris Matthews]] ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews|Hardball]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/006/341eptvh.asp Softball on Hardball – Chris Matthews gives Michael Scheuer a pass –again], ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', 11/10/2005&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joscelyn, Scheuer's claims that "there was no evidence of a relationship between Saddam Hussein's Iraq and al Qaeda", in various interviews, "directly contradicted" Scheuer's earlier assertions, in his first book, in which Scheuer "cited numerous pieces of evidence showing that there was, in fact, a working relationship between Saddam and al Qaeda."

Scheuer wrote about a relationship between [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations|Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda]] in his 2002 book. Yet when interviewed in 2004 he stated that he had found no evidence of a Saddam/al-Qaeda connection. Tim Russert asked Scheuer to explain the seeming contradiction on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' (30 November 2004):
:MR. SCHEUER: I certainly saw a link when I was writing the books in terms of the open-source literature, unclassified literature, but I had nothing to do with Iraq during my professional career until the run-up to the war. What I was talking about on "Hardball" was, I was assigned the duty of going back about nine or 10 years in the classified archives of the CIA. I went through roughly 19,000 documents, probably totaling 50,000 to 60,000 pages, and within that corpus of material, there was absolutely no connection in the terms of a—in the terms of a relationship.

:MR. RUSSERT: But your [2002] book did point out some contacts?

:MR. SCHEUER: Certainly it was available in the open-source material, yes, sir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fredschoeneman.com/archives/000702.html |title=Michael Scheuer Interviewed by Tim Russert |accessdate=2006-03-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060324092433/http://www.fredschoeneman.com/archives/000702.html |archivedate=2006-03-24 |df= }}, fredschoeneman.com, November 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Scheuer explains more fully in the revised edition of his 2002 book the exhaustive study of the evidence of Iraq-al-Qaeda cooperation that eventually led him to the conclusion that there was no relationship between the two forces:

:For a number of reasons, I was available to perform the review of Agency files on Iraq and al Qaeda, and the chief of the bin Laden unit handed me the assignment. I was delighted with the task, eager to begin, and sure that my research would support the analysis I had presented in ''Through Our Enemies' Eyes''. For about four weeks in late 2002 and early 2003, I and several others were engaged full time in searching CIA files—seven days a week, often far more than eight hours a day. At the end of the effort, we had gone back ten years in the files and had reviewed nearly twenty thousand documents that amounted to well over fifty thousand pages of materials. I was both pleased and embarrassed by the results of the research. I was pleased because CIA's position was reaffirmed and the analysis of Mr. Feith's unit was discredited. There was no information that remotely supported the analysis that claimed there was a strong working relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda. I was embarrassed because this reality invalidated the analysis I had presented on the subject in my book.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Scheuer, ''Through Our Enemies' Eyes'' (revised edition). Washington, DC: Potomac Books, 2006) p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libyan insurgency===
Scheuer has stated his objection to any involvement by the US in the [[2011 Libyan civil war|Libyan insurgency]], being particularly critical of the work of United States' UN representative [[Susan E. Rice]], calling the whole affair "none of our business" and essentially a "recruiting tool for terrorists."&lt;ref name=youtube&gt;{{YouTube|IMOtC9zGQHI|Michael Scheuer interview}} on CNN, 1 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
His overall view being that the interests of US foreign policy are far better served by the current status quo, whereby the existing autocratic regimes are better able to suppress the threat he perceives from Al Qaida incursion than western style democratic systems.
Scheuer believes that, irrespective of NATO ostensibly leading the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|bombing operations]], "in the Muslim world, this is Americans killing Muslims again, and it looks like it's for oil."&lt;ref name=youtube /&gt;

===Ron Paul 2012 endorsement===
Scheuer penned an editorial in late December 2011 endorsing US Presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]]. He said, "Dr. Paul's precise use of history and common sense exposes the exorbitantly costly effort to build democracies in the Islamic world for what it is; namely, Washington throwing money down the drain for a cause that is impossibly lost from the start and one that will involve us in wars where we have no interests."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ronpaul.com/2011-12-30/iowas-choice-dr-paul-or-u-s-bankruptcy-more-wars-and-many-more-dead-soldiers-and-marines/ Editorial Article "Iowa’s Choice: Ron Paul or U.S. Bankruptcy, More Wars, and Many More Dead Soldiers and Marines"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donald Trump 2016 endorsement===
Scheuer has expressed his support for [[Donald Trump]], in multiple blog postings on non-intervention.com. Scheuer based his support on, in his view, Trump's strong support of the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|2nd Amendment]], [[Trump's proposed wall]] along the Southern Border, Trump's skepticism of NATO and military intervention in the Muslim World, and Trump's unpopularity with [[neoconservatives]] and their media outlets such as ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', ''[[National Review]]'', and also much of the mainstream media. Scheuer also likes Trump's "America First" talk towards American statecraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://non-intervention.com/ Michael Scheuer's Non-Intervention.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advocacy of killing Trump's opponents===
In July 2018, Scheuer called upon "those millions of well-armed citizens who voted for Trump" to be ready to kill "a long and very precise list" of those who oppose Trump. His list included the entire mainstream media and two former Presidents. "If Trump does not act soon to erase" his opponents, he wrote, "the armed citizenry must step in and eliminate them." Scheuer named those opponents as:

:thug-civil-servants like Strzok, Comey, McCabe, Page, and Rosenstein; worshipers of tyranny, like the Democratic members of Congress, the Clintons, the FBI, and the Obamas; apparent traitors like Brennan, Hayden, and Clapper; all of the mainstream media; and the tens of thousands of government-admitted-and-protected, violent, criminal, and illegal immigrants.&lt;ref name="eliminate"&gt;{{cite web|last=Scheuer|first=Michael|title=A republican citizenry’s greatest, last-resort duty is to kill those seeking to impose tyranny|url=http://non-intervention.com/3238/a-republican-citizenrys-greatest-last-resort-duty-is-to-kill-those-seeking-to-impose-tyranny/|date=14 July 2018|access-date=16 July 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180716071311/http://non-intervention.com/3238/a-republican-citizenrys-greatest-last-resort-duty-is-to-kill-those-seeking-to-impose-tyranny/|archive-date=16 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scheuer concluded by looking forward to the "utter joy and satisfaction to be derived from beholding great piles of dead U.S.-citizen tyrants."

=== European Union ===
In March 2018, Michael Scheuer claimed that the European Union was in the process of "falling apart", saying that British Prime Minister Theresa May was "siding with the EU" during the future relation talks of the [[Brexit|UK seceding the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=John Frederick Show – "Dr. Michael Scheuer: The EU Is Falling Apart"|date=27 March 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh6YmGk3vC4&amp;feature=youtu.be|volume=|pages=|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scheuer has called for the public execution of European politicians, saying that "all European rulers are tyrants" adding that "they are a despicable bunch, the people that head the European Union, and they really deserve to be [[Execution by hanging|hung]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=John Frederick Show – "Dr. Michael Scheuer: Enough Is Enough!:|date=9 July 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww0eJ-iySkY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m48s|volume=|pages=|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is critical of the EU's abolishment of the death penalty and the implications it has on the deportation of terrorist suspects, saying that "the EU's policy of easily obtainable political asylum and its prohibition against deporting wanted or convicted terrorists to a country with a death penalty have made Europe a major, consistent and invulnerable source of terrorist threat to the United States." Scheuer sees the [[extraordinary rendition]]s carried out by the US government as being hindered by the European Union: "The extraordinary rendition programme should not be destroyed because of "venal and prize hungry reporters, grandstanding politicians and sanctimonious Europeans."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/07/03/scheuer_testimony_bin_laden/|title='Effete' Europe useless in GWOT, says bin Laden man|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayals==
In the mini series, ''[[The Looming Tower (miniseries)|The Looming Tower]]'', he is the basis for the character of Martin Schmidt. On the show, he is portrayed as being one of two people primarily responsible for the lack of intelligence sharing between the CIA and the FBI in the lead up to 9/11.

He also lectured at the University of Tartu and was the chief editor of the journal "Ajalooline Ajakiri". Liiv had an academic interest in the history of the 17th century Estonia and contributed to the books ''"The Economic History of Estonia"'' in 1937 and the third volume of ''"History of Estonia"'' in 1940.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4918">In [[Greek comedy]], the '''parabasis''' (plural parabases; {{lang-grc|παράβασις}}, plural: {{lang|grc|παραβάσεις}}) is a point in the play when all of the actors leave the stage and the [[Greek Chorus|chorus]] is left to address the audience directly. The chorus partially or completely abandons its dramatic role, to step forward (parabasis)&lt;ref&gt;J E Sandys ed., ''A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'' (London 1891) p. 458&lt;/ref&gt; and talk to the audience on a topic completely irrelevant to the subject of the play.&lt;ref&gt;S Halliwell ed., ''Birds and Other Plays'' (Oxford 1998) p. xxxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
A parabasis usually consists of three songs (S) alternating with three speeches (s) (or [[recitative]]s) in the order S-s-S-s-S-s. The first speech, or parabasis proper - generally in [[anapaest]]&lt;ref&gt;S Halliwell ed., ''Birds and Other Plays'' (Oxford 1998) p. xxxvi-vii&lt;/ref&gt; - often ends with a passage which is to be rattled off very quickly (theoretically in one breath - called a ''πνῖγος – pnigos'').

==Examples==
*In [[The Knights]], we find [[Aristophanes]] offers a survey of the Athenian comic tradition,&lt;ref&gt;S Halliwell ed., 'Birds and Other Plays'' (Oxford 1998) p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; thereby enhancing his own role: “if one of the old comic poets had tried to force us Knights to address the public in the parabasis he wouldn’t have got away with so lightly. But this time the poet is worthy...”.&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes, quoted in C Russo, ''Aristophanes'' (London 1994) p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

*In the play ''[[The Wasps]]'' by the same author, the first parabasis is about Aristophanes' career as a playwright to date; while the second parabasis is shorter, and contains a string of in-jokes about local characters who would be well known to the ancient Athenian audience (e.g. the politician [[Cleon]]).{{citeneeded|date=August 2018}}

==Authorial voice==
The chorus in the parabasis sometimes uses its own voice, sometimes that of the play’s author, to address the audience.&lt;ref&gt;J Boardman ed., ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (Oxford 1986) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; How far the latter is to be taken as ‘authentic’ is a matter for debate. The old view was that Aristophanes is speaking directly to his fellow-Athenians in the parabasis; and that as a result, as [[Northrop Frye]] put it, “his opinions on every subject are written all over his plays”.&lt;ref&gt;N Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1971) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; A postmodern interpretation would see the authorial voice as [[metatheatrical]], offering a parody of rhetorical debating points, rather than unmediated criticism.&lt;ref&gt;S Halliwell ed., ''Birds and Other Plays'' (Oxford 1998) p. xliv&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
The parabasis is exclusively a feature of [[Old Comedy]], and its decline can be charted in the plays of Aristophanes.  The second parabasis is gradually abandoned, the chorus ceases to speak out of character in the parabasis itself, and finally the latter is abandoned altogether.&lt;ref&gt;S Halliwell ed., ''Birds and Other Plays'' (Oxford 1998) p. xxxvii-ix&lt;/ref&gt; 

Where the diminishment in the role of the chorus was traditionally linked to the financial pressures of wartime,&lt;ref&gt;J E Sandys ed., ''A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'' (London 1891) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; more recently [[Stephen Halliwell (academic)|Stephen Halliwell]] has preferred to see the decline in terms of theatrical evolution.&lt;ref&gt;S Halliwell ed., ''Birds and Other Plays'' (Oxford 1998) p. xxxix&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pittsburg''' is a [[New England town|town]] in [[Coos County, New Hampshire|Coos County]], [[New Hampshire]], United States.  The population was 869 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].&lt;ref&gt;United States Census Bureau, [http://factfinder2.census.gov/main.html American FactFinder], 2010 Census figures. Retrieved March 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the northernmost town in New Hampshire and the largest town by area in the state – and in New England as well – more than twice the size of the next largest town, [[Lincoln, New Hampshire|Lincoln]]. [[U.S. Route 3]] is the only major highway in the town, although the northern terminus of [[New Hampshire Route 145]] also lies within Pittsburg.

Pittsburg is part of the [[Berlin, New Hampshire|Berlin]], New Hampshire–[[Vermont]] [[Berlin micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]].

== History ==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2012}}
Pittsburg derives its name from [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] of the [[United Kingdom]].  Prior to its incorporation in 1840, the area was settled [[circa|c.]] 1810 and known as the Territory of Indian Stream.  It had the unique distinction of having been its own [[microstate]] briefly during the 1830s, called the [[Republic of Indian Stream]], due to an ambiguous boundary between the United States and Canada.

== Geography ==
Pittsburg shares an international border with [[Québec]] province, [[Canada]] to its west and north, and borders the states of [[Maine]] (to the east) and [[Vermont]] (a very small portion to the southwest).  Directly to the south is [[Clarksville, New Hampshire|Clarksville]]. Pittsburg is the only New Hampshire municipality to border Canada, the only one that borders both Maine and Vermont, the only one to share a land border with Vermont, and the only town entirely north of the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]]. Pittsburg contains the only part of New Hampshire west of the [[Connecticut River]], as that river defines the Vermont state line from Clarksville southward. The [[Pittsburg-Chartierville Border Crossing]], New Hampshire's only Canadian border crossing, is located in the town, at the northern terminus of [[U.S. Route 3]]. The western edge of Pittsburg is defined by [[Halls Stream]], being the "northwesternmost headwaters of the [[Connecticut River]]", which defined (ambiguously) the border in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1783.

Contained within the boundaries of Pittsburg are the [[Connecticut Lakes]], which form the beginning of the Connecticut River. Early maps (e.g. 1854) also show several grants that were incorporated into the eastern edge of Pittsburg, including ''Carlisle No. 1'', ''Webster/Carlisle No. 2'' and ''Hubbards No. 3'', all north of [[Atkinson and Gilmanton Academy Grant, New Hampshire|Atkinson and Gilmanton Academy Grant]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|291.2|sqmi}}, the largest of any municipality incorporated as a town in both New Hampshire and New England. A total of {{convert|281.4|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|9.8|sqmi}} is water, the latter comprising 3.37% of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001) – Pittsburg town, New Hampshire| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau American Factfinder| accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest point in Pittsburg is the summit of Stub Hill, at {{convert|3627|ft|m}} above [[sea level]]. [[Mount Magalloway]], {{convert|3383|ft|m}} above sea level, is a prominent summit reachable by hiking trail.

As of the [[census]]&lt;ref name="GR2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=American FactFinder}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 2000, there were 867 people, 386 households, and 264 families residing in the town.  The [[population density]] was 3.1 people per square mile (1.2/km²).  There were 1,281 housing units at an average density of 4.5 per square mile (1.8/km²).  The racial makeup of the town was 98.27% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.12% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.58% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.23% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.81% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 0.46% of the population.

There were 386 households out of which 22.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 59.1% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 4.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.6% were non-families. 26.7% of all households were made up of individuals and 14.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.24 and the average family size was 2.67.

In the town, the population was spread out with 18.9% under the age of 18, 5.4% from 18 to 24, 23.8% from 25 to 44, 32.9% from 45 to 64, and 19.0% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 46 years. For every 100 females, there were 105.9 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 105.6 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $38,516, and the median income for a family was $42,500. Males had a median income of $31,250 versus $25,455 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the town was $17,703.  About 5.0% of families and 7.4% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 7.8% of those under age 18 and 11.5% of those age 65 or over.

==Tourism==
Pittsburg is a mecca for [[snowmobile]] and [[all-terrain vehicle|ATV]] enthusiasts year round. In the winter months thousands of people flock to Pittsburg to take advantage of the state-funded and club-supported and maintained trails that can bring snowmobilers from anywhere in the state of New Hampshire to Pittsburg, with access to the states of [[Maine]], Vermont and the border crossing to [[Canada]]. Some of the same trails are used in the summer for ATVs. Check the [http://www.pittsburgridgerunners.org Pittsburg Ridge Runners Snowmobile Club] and the [http://www.greatnorthwoodsATV.org Great North Woods Riders ATV Club] web sites for further information. Also, for weather information specific to the First Connecticut Lake in Pittsburg check [http://www.johnsnhweather.com/ John's NH Weather] for current conditions, forecast and much more.

Another focus in the area for tourists is [[fishing]] and [[hunting]]. Pittsburg is home to the four [[Connecticut Lakes]], [[Back Lake (New Hampshire)|Back Lake]], part of [[Lake Francis (Murphy Dam)|Lake Francis]], and numerous smaller water bodies. The lakes are annually stocked with fish and allow for weekends of good fishing. The area is known for [[fly fishing]]. Two sections of the Connecticut River are fly fishing only, including the "Trophy Stretch". The Connecticut Lakes Region has attracted anglers and hunters since the turn of the century. There are maps on the local snowmobile club's website that can be helpful in planning a trip to the area. It shows all trails in Pittsburg as well as roads and access points to the lakes and rivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pittsburgridgerunners.org/maps Pittsburg Ridgerunners Snowmobile Club: Maps]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lake Francis State Park]] allows for lakeside camping, fishing, and canoeing on the lake or the Connecticut River. [[Deer Mountain Campground]] enables camping and picnicking on the Connecticut River.

'''Quipu''' (also spelled '''khipu'''), or '''talking knots''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/9611/abstracts/inka.html|title=Talking Knots of the Inka|last1=Domenici |first1=Viviano |last2=Domenici |first2=Davide|journal=[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]|volume=49|number=6|date=1996|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; were recording devices fashioned from [[String (structure)|strings]] historically used by a number of cultures in the region of [[Andes|Andean]] [[South America]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20160102"&gt;{{cite news |last=Neuman |first=William |title=Untangling an Accounting Tool and an Ancient Inca Mystery|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/world/americas/untangling-an-accounting-tool-and-an-ancient-incan-mystery.html |date=January 2, 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=January 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knotted strings were used by many other cultures such as the [[Ancient China|ancient Chinese]] and [[native Hawaiians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobsen|first1=Lyle E.|title=Use of Knotted String Accounting Records in Old Hawaii and Ancient China|url=http://www.accountingin.com/accounting-historians-journal/volume-10-number-2/use-of-knotted-string-accounting-records-in-old-hawaii-and-ancient-china/|website=Accounting Historians Journal|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but such practices should not be confused with the quipu, which refers only to the Andean device. 

A ''quipu'' usually consisted of cotton or camelid fiber strings. The [[Inca people]] used them for collecting data and keeping records, monitoring tax obligations, properly collecting [[census]] records, calendrical information, and for military organization.&lt;ref&gt;D'altroy, Terence N. (2001). 18&lt;/ref&gt; The cords stored numeric and other values [[encoded]] as knots, often in a [[Decimal|base ten]] [[positional system]]. A ''quipu'' could have only a few or thousands of cords.&lt;ref name="Quipu 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientscripts.com/quipu.html|title=Ancient Scripts: Quipu|website=www.ancientscripts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The configuration of the ''quipus'' has been "compared to string mops."&lt;ref&gt;Urton, Gary, Carrie Brezine. Harvard University. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence has also shown the use of finely carved wood as a supplemental, and perhaps more sturdy, base to which the [[color-coded]] cords would be attached.&lt;ref&gt;D'altroy, Terence N. (2001). 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; A relatively small number have survived.

Objects that can be identified unambiguously as quipus first appear in the archaeological record in the first millennium AD. They subsequently played a key part in the administration of the [[Kingdom of Cusco]] and later [[Tawantinsuyu]], the empire controlled by the [[Inca]] ethnic group, flourishing across the [[Andes]] from c. 1100 to 1532 AD. As the region was subsumed under the invading [[Spanish Empire]], the use of the quipu faded from use, to be replaced by European writing and numeral systems. However, in several villages, quipu continued to be important items for the local community, albeit for [[ritual]] rather than practical use. It is unclear as to where and how many intact quipus still exist, as many have been stored away in [[mausoleums]]&lt;ref&gt;Urton, Gary. (2011). "Tying the Archive in Knots, or: Dying to Get into the Archive in Ancient Peru&lt;/ref&gt;

''Quipu'' is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] spelling and the most common spelling in [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|quipu|id=156742}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Khipu'' (pronounced {{IPA-qu|ˈkʰipu|}}, plural: ''khipukuna'') is the word for "[[knot]]" in [[Qusqu-Qullaw|Cusco Quechua]]. In most Quechua varieties, the term is ''kipu''.

== Etymology ==
The word "khipu", meaning "knot" or "to knot", comes from the [[Quechua language]] word: quipu, 1704, the "lingua franca and language of administration" of [[Tawantin Suyu]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Urt03|Urton 2003]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
[[File:Nueva corónica y buen gobierno (1936 facsimile) p360.png|thumb|A ''quipucamayoc'' in ''[[El primer nueva corónica y buen gobierno|El primer nueva corónica]]''. On the lower left is a [[yupana]] – an Inca calculating device.]]

Most information recorded on the ''quipus'' consists of numbers in a decimal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ordish, George |author2=Hyams, Edward |title=The last of the Incas: the rise and fall of an American empire |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble |location=New York |year=1996 |pages=80 |isbn=0-88029-595-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]], Spanish officials often relied on the quipus to settle disputes over local [[tribute payment]]s or goods production. ''Quipucamayocs'' ([[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] ''khipu kamayuq'' "khipu specialist", plural: ''khipu kamayuqkuna'') could be summoned to court, where their bookkeeping was recognised as valid documentation of past payments.

Some of the knots, as well as other features, such as color, are thought to represent non-numeric information, which has not been deciphered. It is generally thought that the system did not include phonetic symbols analogous to letters of the alphabet. However [[Gary Urton]] has suggested that the ''quipus'' used a binary system which could record [[phonology|phonological]] or [[Logogram|logographic]] data.

To date, no link has yet been found between a ''quipu'' and Quechua, the native language of the [[Peruvian]] Andes. This suggests that ''quipus'' are not a glottographic writing system and have no [[phonetic]] referent. Frank Salomon at the University of Wisconsin has argued that ''quipus'' are actually a [[semasiographic]] language, a system of representative symbols{{snd}}such as [[music notation]] or [[Numeral system|numerals]]{{snd}}that relay information but are not directly related to the speech sounds of a particular language. The Khipu Database Project (KDP), begun by Gary Urton, may have already decoded the first word from a quipu&amp;ndash;the name of a village, [[Puruchuco]]&amp;ndash;which Urton believes was represented by a three-number sequence, similar to a [[ZIP code]]. If this conjecture is correct, ''quipus'' are the only known example of a complex language recorded in a [[Three-dimensional space|3-D]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Mark (July 12, 2011) [http://www.slate.com/id/2298567/pagenum/2] "Questioning the Inca Paradox: Did the civilization behind Machu Picchu really fail to develop a written language?"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== System ===
{{Numeral systems}}
Marcia and Robert Ascher, after having analyzed several hundred ''quipus'', have shown that most information on ''quipus'' is numeric, and these numbers can be read. Each cluster of knots is a digit, and there are three main types of knots: simple [[overhand knot]]s; "long knots", consisting of an overhand knot with one or more additional [[turn (knot)|turns]]; and [[figure-eight knot]]s. In the Aschers’ system, a fourth type of knot—figure-of-eight knot with an extra twist—is referred to as "EE". A number is represented as a sequence of knot clusters in base 10.&lt;ref&gt;"Quipu" (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Powers of ten are shown by position along the string, and this position is aligned between successive strands.
* Digits in positions for 10 and higher powers are represented by clusters of simple knots (e.g., 40 is four simple knots in a row in the "tens" position).
* Digits in the "ones" position are represented by long knots (e.g., 4 is a knot with four turns).  Because of the way the knots are tied, the digit 1 cannot be shown this way and is represented in this position by a figure-of-eight knot.
* [[Zero]] is represented by the absence of a knot in the appropriate position.
* Because the ones digit is shown in a distinctive way, it is clear where a number ends.  One strand on a ''quipu'' can therefore contain several numbers.

For example, if 4s represents four simple knots, 3L represents a long knot with three turns, E represents a figure-of-eight knot and X represents a space:
* The number 731 would be represented by 7s, 3s, E.
* The number 804 would be represented by 8s, X, 4L.
* The number 107 followed by the number 51 would be represented by 1s, X, 7L, 5s, E.

This reading can be confirmed by a fortunate fact: ''quipus'' regularly contain sums in a systematic way. For instance, a cord may contain the sum of the next ''n'' cords, and this relationship is repeated throughout the ''quipu''. Sometimes there are sums of sums as well. Such a relationship would be very improbable if the knots were incorrectly read.&lt;ref name="Quipu 2012" /&gt;

Some data items are not numbers but what Ascher and Ascher call ''number labels''. They are still composed of digits, but the resulting number seems to be used as a code, much as we use numbers to identify individuals, places, or things. Lacking the context for individual quipus, it is difficult to guess what any given code might mean. Other aspects of a ''quipu'' could have communicated information as well: color-coding, relative placement of cords, spacing, and the structure of cords and sub-cords.&lt;ref name="Locke, 1912"&gt;Locke, 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literary uses ===
Some have argued that far more than numeric information is present and that ''quipus'' are a [[writing system]]. This would be an especially important discovery as there is no surviving record of written Quechua predating the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|Spanish invasion]]. Possible reasons for this apparent absence of a written language include an actual absence of a written language, destruction by the Spanish of all written records, or the successful concealment by the Inca peoples of those records.  Making the matter even more complex, the Inca 'kept separate "khipu" for each province, on which a pendant string recorded the number of people belonging to each category.'&lt;ref&gt;D'altroy, Terrence N. "The Incas." 234–235&lt;/ref&gt;  This creates yet another step in the process of decryption in addition to the Spanish attempts at eradicating the system.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Historians Edward Hyams and George Ordish believe quipus were recording devices, similar to musical notation, in that the notes on the page present basic information, and the performer would then bring those details to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ordish, George |author2=Hyams, Edward |title=The last of the Incas: the rise and fall of an American empire |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble |location=New York |year=1996 |pages=84 |isbn=0-88029-595-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, while checking the geometric signs that appear on drawings of Inca dresses from the ''[[Primer Nueva Corónica y Buen Gobierno|First New Chronicle and Good Government]]'', written by [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala]] in 1615, [[William Burns Glynn]] found a pattern that seems to decipher some words from ''quipus'' by matching knots to colors of strings.

The August 12, 2005, edition of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' includes a report titled "Khipu Accounting in Ancient Peru" by anthropologist [[Gary Urton]] and mathematician [[Carrie J. Brezine]].&lt;ref name="Urton &amp; Brezine (2005)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Urton|first1=Gary|last2=Brezine|first2=Carrie J.|title=Khipu Accounting in Ancient Peru|journal=Science|date=12 August 2005|volume=309|issue=5737|pages=1065–1067|doi=10.1126/science.1113426|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/309/5737/1065.abstract?sid=83f6d720-81e6-4831-a003-f370e8c656aa|pmid=16099983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work may represent the first identification of a ''quipu'' element for a non-numeric concept, a sequence of three figure-of-eight knots at the start of a ''quipu'' that seems to be a unique signifier. It could be a [[toponym]] for the city of Puruchuco (near [[Lima]]), or the name of the ''quipu'' keeper who made it, or its subject matter, or even a time designator.

Beynon-Davies considers ''quipus'' as a sign system and develops an interpretation of their physical structure in terms of the concept of a [[data system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beynon-Davies | first1 = P | year = 2009 | title = Significant threads: the nature of data | url = | journal = International Journal of Information Management | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 170–188 | doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2008.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Khipu kamayuqkuna'' (knot makers/keepers, i.e., the former Inka record keepers) supplied colonial administrators with a variety and quantity of information pertaining to censuses, tribute, ritual and calendrical organization, genealogies, and other such matters from Inka times. Performing a number of statistical tests for quipu sample VA 42527, one study led by Alberto Sáez-Rodríguez discovered that the distribution and patterning of S- and Z-knots can organize the information system from a real star map.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Laura Minelli, a professor of [[pre-Columbian]] studies at the [[University of Bologna]], has discovered something which she believed to be a seventeenth-century [[Jesuit]] manuscript that contains detailed information on literary ''quipus''. This manuscript consists of nine [[folios]] with Spanish, [[Latin]], and ciphered Italian texts. Owned by the family of Neapolitan historian Clara Miccinelli, the manuscript also includes a wool ''quipu'' fragment. Miccinelli believes that the text was written by two Italian Jesuit missionaries, Joan Antonio Cumis and Giovanni Anello Oliva, around 1610–1638, and [[Blas Valera]], a [[mestizo]] Jesuit sometime before 1618. Along with the details of reading literary ''quipus'', the documents also discuss the events and people of the Spanish conquest of [[Peru]]. However, the authenticity of these documents is highly questioned, and they seem to be inspired freely by a 1751 writing of [[Raimondo di Sangro|Prince San Severo]].

In the text of these documents, Cumis states that there are ''quipus'' which accounted for uses other than accounting. Since so many ''quipus'' were burned by the Spanish, very few remained for Cumis to analyze.{{cn|date=September 2018}} As related in the manuscript, the word [[Pacha Kamaq]], the Inca deity of earth and time, was used many times in these ''quipus'', where the syllables were represented by symbols formed in the knots. Following the analysis of the use of "Pacha Kamaq", the manuscript offers a list of many words present in ''quipus''. Bruce Mannheim, the director of the Center for Latin American Studies at the [[University of Michigan]], and [[Colgate University]]'s Gary Urton, question its origin and authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Domenici, Viviano and Davide, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quipu 2012" /&gt;

[[File:Quipu.png|thumb|upright|Representation of a ''quipu'' (1888)]]

''Quipucamayocs'' (Quechua ''khipu kamayuq'', "khipu-authority"), the accountants of [[Tawantin Suyu]], created and deciphered the quipu knots. ''Quipucamayocs'' could carry out basic [[arithmetic]] operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They kept track of [[Mita (Inca)|mita]], a form of [[taxation]]. The ''quipucamayocs'' also tracked the type of [[labour (economics)|labor]] being performed, maintained a record of [[economic output]], and ran a [[census]] that counted everyone from infants to "old blind men over 80". The system was also used to keep track of the calendar. According to Guaman Poma, ''quipucamayocs'' could "read" the quipus with their eyes closed.&lt;ref name="Quipu 2012" /&gt;

''Quipucamayocs'' were from a class of people, "males, fifty to sixty",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ordish, George |author2=Hyams, Edward |title=The last of the Incas: the rise and fall of an American empire |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble |location=New York |year=1996 |pages=69 |isbn=0-88029-595-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were not the only members of [[Inca#Society|Inca society]] to use quipus. Inca [[historians]] used quipus when telling the Spanish about Tawantin Suyu history (whether they only recorded important numbers or actually contained the story itself is unknown). Members of the ruling class were usually taught to read quipus in the Inca equivalent of a university, the ''yachay wasi'' (literally, "house of teaching"), in the third year of schooling, for the higher classes who would eventually become the bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ordish, George |author2=Hyams, Edward |title=The last of the Incas: the rise and fall of an American empire |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble |location=New York |year=1996 |pages=113 |isbn=0-88029-595-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1532, the [[Spanish Empire]]'s conquest of the Andean region began, with several Spanish conquerors making note of the existence of quipus in their written records about the invasion. The earliest known example comes from [[Hernando Pizarro]], the brother of the Spanish military leader [[Francisco Pizarro]], who recorded an encounter that he and his men had in 1533 as they traveled along the royal road from the highlands to the central coast.&lt;ref name="Locke, 1912" /&gt; It was during this journey that they encountered several quipu keepers, later relating that these keepers "untied some of the knots which they had in the deposits section [of the khipu], and they [re-]tied them in another section [of the khipu]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Urt03|Urton 2003]]. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish authorities quickly suppressed the use of ''quipus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuprienko.info/fernando-murillo-de-la-cerda-carta-sobre-los-caracteres-usados-por-los-indios-antes-de-la-conquista-1589/|title=Fernando Murillo de la Serda.

== Contemporary social importance ==
The ''quipu'' system operated as both a method of calculation and social organization, regulating regional governance and land use.&lt;ref&gt;Niles, Susan A. (2007). Considering ''Quipus:'' Andean Knotted String Records in Analytical Context. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;  While evidence for the latter is still under the critical eye of scholars around the world, the very fact that they are kept to this day without any confirmed level of fluent literacy in the system is testament to its historical 'moral authority.'&lt;ref name="Niles, Susan A. 2007. 93"&gt;Niles, Susan A. (2007). 93&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, "khipu" is regarded as a powerful symbol of heritage, only 'unfurled' and handled by 'pairs of [contemporary] dignitaries,' as the system and its 'construction embed' modern 'cultural knowledge.'&lt;ref name="Niles, Susan A. 2007. 93" /&gt;  Ceremonies in which they are 'curated, even though they can no longer be read,' is even further support for the case of societal honor and significance associated with the quipu.&lt;ref name="Niles, Susan A. 2007. 93" /&gt;  Even today, 'the knotted cords must be present and displayed when village officers leave or begin service, and draping the cords over the incoming office holders instantiates the moral and political authority of the past.'&lt;ref name="Niles, Susan A. 2007. 93" /&gt;  These examples are indicative of how the ''quipu'' system is not only fundamental mathematically or linguistically for the original Inca, but also for the cultural preservation of the original empire's descendants.

[[Anthropologists]] and [[archaeologists]] working in [[Peru]] have highlighted two known cases where ''quipus'' have continued to be used by contemporary communities, albeit as ritual items seen as "communal patrimony" rather than as devices for recording information.&lt;ref name="Peters and Salomon 41"&gt;[[#Pet06/07|Peters and Salomon 2006/2007]]. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The khipu system, being the efficient method of social management it was for the Inca, is also a link to the Cuzco census, as it was one of the primary methods of population calculation.&lt;ref name="D'Altroy, Terence N. 2001"&gt;D'Altroy, Terence N. (2001). 234–235&lt;/ref&gt; This also has allowed historians and anthropologists to understand both the census and the "decimal hierarchy" system the Inca used, and that they were actually 'initiated together,' due to the fact that they were 'conceptually so closely linked.'&lt;ref name="D'Altroy, Terence N. 2001" /&gt;

=== Tupicocha, Peru ===
In 1994, the American cultural anthropologist Frank Salomon conducted a study in the Peruvian village of Tupicocha, where ''quipus'' are still an important part of the social life of the village.&lt;ref&gt;Domenici, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1994, this was the only village where quipus with a structure similar to pre-Columbian ''quipus'' were still used for official local government record-keeping and functions, although the villagers did not associate their quipus with Inca artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sal04|Salomon 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== San Cristóbal de Rapaz, Peru ===
The villagers of San Cristóbal de Rapaz (known as Rapacinos), located in the [[Oyón Province|Province of Oyón]], keep a quipu in an old ceremonial building, the ''Kaha Wayi'', that is itself surrounded by a walled architectural complex. Also within the complex is a disused communal storehouse, known as the ''Pasa Qullqa'', which was formerly used to protect and redistribute the local crops, and some Rapacinos believe that the ''quipu'' was once a record of this process of collecting and redistributing food.&lt;ref name="Locke, 1912" /&gt; The entire complex was important to the villagers, being "the seat of traditional control over land use, and the centre of communication with the deified mountains who control weather".&lt;ref name="Peters and Salomon 41" /&gt;

In 2004, the archaeologist Renata Peeters (of the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology]] in London) and the cultural anthropologist Frank Salomon (of the [[University of Wisconsin]]) undertook a project to conserve both the ''quipus'' in Rapaz and the building that it was in, due to their increasingly poor condition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pet06/07|Peters and Salomon 2006/2007]]. pp. 41–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological investigation ==
The archaeologist [[Gary Urton]] noted in his 2003 book ''Signs of the Inka Khipu'' that he estimated "from my own studies and from the published works of other scholars that there are about 600 extant ''quipu'' in public and private collections around the world."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Urt03|Urton 2003]]. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Khipu Database Project&lt;ref name="khipudatabase"&gt;{{cite web | title = Khipu Database Project | url=http://khipukamayuq.fas.harvard.edu/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; undertaken by [[Harvard University]] professor Gary Urton and his colleague Carrie Brezine, 751 quipus have been reported to exist across the globe. Their whereabouts range from [[Europe]] to [[North America|North]] and [[South America]]. Most are housed in museums outside of their native countries, however some reside in their native locations under the care of the descendants of those who made the knot records. A table of the largest collections is shown below.

While patrimonial quipu collections have not been accounted for in this database, their numbers are likely to be unknown. One prominent patrimonial collection held by the Rapazians of Rapaz, Peru, was recently researched by [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] professor, Frank Salomon. The Anthropology/Archaeology department at the [[University of California at Santa Barbara]] also holds one ''quipu''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

=== Preservation ===
''Quipus'' are made of [[fiber]]s, either spun and plied thread such as [[wool]] or [[hair]] from [[alpaca]], [[llama]], [[guanaco]] or [[vicuña]], though are also commonly made of [[cellulose]] like [[cotton]]. The [[knot]]ted strings of ''quipus'' were often made with an "elaborate system of knotted cords, dyed in various colors, the significance of which was known to the [[magistrates]]".&lt;ref name="Bingham"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bingham |first= Hiram  |authorlink=Hiram Bingham III |title=''Lost City of the Incas, The Story of Machu Picchu and its Builders’.'' |year=1948 |publisher=Duell, Sloan &amp; Pearce |location=New York |oclc=486224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fading of [[color]], natural or dyed, cannot be reversed, and may indicate further damage to the fibers. Colors can darken if attacked by dust or by certain [[dyes]] and [[mordants]]. ''Quipus'' have been found with adornments, such as [[animal shell]]s, attached to the cords, and these non-textile materials may require additional preservation measures.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

''Quipus'' are now preserved using techniques that will minimise their future degradation. [[Museum]]s, [[archive]]s and special collections have adopted preservation guidelines from [[textile]] practices.

Environmental controls are used to monitor and control [[temperature]], [[humidity]] and [[light]] exposure of storage areas. As with all textiles, cool, clean, dry and dark environments are most suitable. The heating, ventilating and air conditioning, or [[HVAC]] systems, of buildings that house quipu knot records are usually automatically regulated. Relative humidity should be 60% or lower, with low temperatures, as high temperatures can damage the fibres and make them brittle. Damp conditions and high humidity can damage protein-rich material. [[Textiles]] suffer damage from [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light, which can include fading and weakening of the fibrous material. When quipus are on display, their exposure to ambient conditions is usually minimized and closely monitored.&lt;ref name="conservationregister"&gt;{{cite web | title = Conservation Register | url = http://www.conservationregister.com/christening.asp?id=4 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/611uplB3W?url=http://www.conservationregister.com/christening.asp?id=4 | archivedate = 2011-08-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damage can occur during storage. The more accessible the items are during storage, the greater the chance of early detection.&lt;ref name="conservationregister" /&gt;  Storing quipus horizontally on boards covered with a neutral [[pH]] paper (paper that is neither [[acid]] or [[alkaline]]) to prevent potential acid transfer is a preservation technique that extends the life of a collection. The fibers can be abraded by rubbing against each other or, for those attached to sticks or rods, by their own weight if held in an upright position.&lt;ref name="storage"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Piechota |first=Dennis |title =Storage Containerization Archaeological Textile Collections  |journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation  | volume=18 |issue=1  | pages=10–18  | year=1978 |doi =10.2307/3179387 |jstor=3179387}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Extensive handling of ''quipus'' can also increase the risk of further damage.

''Quipus'' are also closely monitored for [[mold]], as well as [[insect]]s and their [[larva]]e. As with all textiles, these are major problems. [[Fumigation]] may not be recommended for fiber textiles displaying mold or insect [[Ectoparasitic infestation|infestations]], although it is common practice for ridding [[paper]] of mold and insects.

Conservators in the field of [[library science]] have the skills to handle a variety of situations. Even though some quipus have hundreds of cords, each cord should be assessed and treated individually. ''Quipu'' cords can be "mechanically cleaned with brushes, small tools and light vacuuming".&lt;ref name="Salomon" /&gt; Just as the application of [[fungicides]] is not recommended to rid quipus of mold, neither is the use of [[solvents]] to clean them.

Even when people have tried to preserve ''quipus'', corrective care may still be required. If ''quipus'' are to be conserved close to their place of origin, local camelid or wool fibres in natural colors can be obtained and used to mend breaks and splits in the cords.&lt;ref name="Salomon"&gt;{{Cite book |last1= Salomon |first1= Frank |last2= Peters, |first2= Renata |title=''Governance and Conservation of the Rapaz Khipu Patrimony.'' |year=2007 |publisher=''Archaeology International'' #10.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Rosa Choque Gonzales and Rosalia Choque Gonzales, conservators from southern Peru, worked to conserve the Rapaz patrimonial quipus in the Andean village of Rapaz, Peru. These ''quipus'' had undergone repair in the past, so this conservator team used new local camelid and wool fibers to spin around the area under repair in a similar fashion to the earlier repairs found on the quipu.&lt;ref name="Salomon" /&gt;

When Gary Urton, professor of [[Anthropology]] at Harvard, was asked "Are they [quipus] fragile?", he answered, "some of them are, and you can't touch them – they would break or turn into dust. Many are quite well preserved, and you can actually study them without doing them any harm. Of course, any time you touch an ancient fabric like that, you're doing some damage, but these strings are generally quite durable."&lt;ref name="string"&gt;{{cite web |title=Conversations String Theorist |url=http://www.archaeology.org/0511/etc/conversations.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ruth Shady]], a [[Peru]]vian [[archeologist]], has discovered a ''quipu'' or perhaps ''proto-quipu'' believed to be around 5,000 years old in the coastal city of [[Caral]]. It was in quite good condition, with "brown cotton strings wound around thin sticks", along with "a series of offerings, including mysterious fiber balls of different sizes wrapped in 'nets' and pristine reed baskets. Piles of raw cotton – uncombed and containing seeds, though turned a dirty brown by the ages – and a ball of cotton thread" were also found preserved. The good condition of these articles can be attributed to the [[arid]] condition of Caral.&lt;ref name="proto-quipu"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mann |first=Charles |title =Unraveling Khipu's Secrets |journal=Science | volume=309  | pages=1008–1009  | year=2005 |doi=10.1126/science.309.5737.1008 |pmid=16099962 |issue=5737}} {{cite web |title=proto-quipu |url=http://www.charlesmann.org/articles/Science-khipu-decipher-08-05.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Richard Overy]]; ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004, pp. 287: "During the War [Hitler] reflected that in the long run, ‘National Socialism and religion will no longer be able to exist together. Both Stalin and Hitler wanted a neutered religion, subservient to the state, while the slow programme of scientific revelation destroyed the foundation of religious myth."
*[[Richard Overy]]: ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004, p. 281: "Hitler believed that all religions were now 'decadent'; in Europe it was the 'collapse of Christianity that we are now experiencing'. The reason for the crisis was science."
*[[Richard J. Evans]]; ''The Third Reich at War''; Penguin Press; New York 2009, p. 547: wrote that Hitler believed that in the long run National Socialism and religion would not be able to co-exist, and stressed repeatedly that Nazism was a secular ideology, founded on modern science: "Science, he declared, would easily destroy the last remaining vestiges of superstition". Germany could not tolerate the intervention of foreign influences such as the Pope and "Priests, he said, were 'black bugs', 'abortions in black cassocks'".
*[[Alan Bullock]], ''Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives'', Fontana Press 1993, p. 412.: Bullock notes Hitler's use of rhetoric of "Providence" but concludes that Hitler, Stalin and Napoleon all shared the same materialist outlook "based on the nineteenth century rationalists' certainty that the progress of science would destroy all myths and had already proved Christian doctrine to be an absurdity"
*''[[Hitler's Table Talk]]'': Hitler is reported as saying: "The dogma of Christianity gets worn away before the advances of science. Religion will have to make more and more concessions. Gradually the myths crumble. All that's left is to prove that in nature there is no frontier between the organic and the inorganic. When understanding of the universe has become widespread, when the majority of men know that the stars are not sources of light but worlds, perhaps inhabited worlds like ours, then the Christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity."&lt;/ref&gt; In light of evidence such as his fierce [[Criticism of Christianity|criticism]] and vocal rejection of the tenets of [[Christianity]],&lt;ref name="Bundle5"&gt;

*[[Ian Kershaw]]; ''Hitler: a Biography''; Norton; 2008 ed; pp. 295–297:  "In early 1937 [Hitler] was declaring that 'Christianity was ripe for destruction', and that the Churches must yield to the 'primacy of the state', railing against any compromise with 'the most horrible institution imaginable'"

When understanding of the universe has become widespread, when the majority of men know that the stars are not sources of light but worlds, perhaps inhabited worlds like ours, then the Christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Hanfstaengl]], a friend from his early days in politics, says Hitler "was to all intents and purposes an atheist by the time I got to know him". However, historians such as Richard Weikart and Alan Bullock doubt the assessment that he was a true atheist, suggesting that despite his dislike of Christianity he still clung to a form of spiritual belief. &lt;ref name=weikart2&gt;{{cite book|title=Hitler's Religion: The Twisted Beliefs that Drove the Third Reich|last=Weikart|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Weikart|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=40|year=2016|isbn=1621575519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler was born to a practising Catholic [[Klara Hitler|mother]], and was [[baptism|baptised]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. From a young age, he expressed disbelief and hostility to Christianity.&lt;ref name=schramm /&gt; But in 1904, acquiescing to his mother's wish, he was [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|confirmed]] at the Roman Catholic Cathedral in [[Linz, Austria]], where the family lived.&lt;ref&gt;Bullock (1991), p.26&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Willard Toland]], witnesses indicate that Hitler's confirmation sponsor had to "drag the words out of him&amp;nbsp;... almost as though the whole confirmation was repugnant to him".&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;John Toland; ''Hitler''; Wordsworth Editions; 1997 Edn; pp. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Rissmann notes that, according to several witnesses who lived with Hitler in a men's home in Vienna, Hitler never again attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or received the [[sacrament]]s after leaving home.&lt;ref name="Michael Rissmann 2001, pp. 94–96"/&gt; &lt;!-- Can we find an English source for this? --&gt;

In Hitler's early political statements, he attempted to express himself to the German public as a Christian.&lt;ref name=conway /&gt; In his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' and in public speeches prior to and in the early years of his rule, he described himself as a Christian.&lt;ref name="speeches"&gt;Norman H.

Conway]] considered that [[Richard Steigmann-Gall|Steigmann-Gall]]'s analysis differed from earlier interpretations only by "degree and timing", but that if Hitler's early speeches evidenced a sincere appreciation of Christianity, "this Nazi Christianity was eviscerated of all the most essential orthodox dogmas" leaving only "the vaguest impression combined with anti-Jewish prejudice..." which few would recognize as "true Christianity".&lt;/ref&gt; the vast majority believe that Hitler was skeptical of religion and anti-Christian, but recognized that he could only be elected and preserve his political power if he feigned a commitment to and belief in Christianity, which the overwhelming majority of Germans believed in.&lt;ref name="Bundle9"&gt;*[[Ian Kershaw]]; ''Hitler 1936-1945 Nemesis''; WW Norton &amp; Company; 2000; pp.39-40 &amp; ''Hitler: a Biography''; Norton; 2008 ed; pp. 295–297:  "In early 1937, he was declaring that 'Christianity was ripe for destruction' (''Untergang''), and that the churches must therefore yield to the 'primacy of the state', railing against 'the most horrible institution imaginable."
*[[Ian Kershaw]]; ''Hitler 1936-1945 Nemesis''; WW Norton &amp; Company; 2000; pp.40: ""The assault on the practices and institutions of the Christian churches was deeply imbedded in the psyche of National Socialism.&amp;nbsp;... however much Hitler on some occasions claimed to want a respite in the conflict [with the churches], his own inflammatory comments gave his underlings all the license they needed to turn up the heat on the 'Church Struggle', confident that they were working towards the Fuhrer".

*[[Laurence Rees]]; The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler; Ebury Press; 2012; p. 135: "Hitler, as a politician, simply recognised the practical reality of the world he inhabited&amp;nbsp;... Thus his relationship in public to Christianity—indeed his relationship to religion in general—was opportunistic. There is no evidence that Hitler himself, in his personal life, ever expressed any individual belief in the basic tenets of the Christian church."
*[[Alan Bullock]]; ''[[Hitler: a Study in Tyranny]]''; Harper Perennial Edition 1991; p. 219: "In Hitler's eyes, Christianity was a religion fit only for slaves; he detested its ethics in particular.[...] From political considerations he restrained his anti-clericalism seeing clearly the dangers of strengthening the church through persecution. Once the war was over, he promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian Churches&amp;nbsp;..."
*Alan Bullock, ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]'', Fontana Press 1993, p. 412.: Bullock notes Hitler's use of rhetoric of "Providence" but concludes that Hitler, Stalin and Napoleon all shared the same materialist outlook "based on the nineteenth century rationalists' certainty that the progress of science would destroy all myths and had already proved Christian doctrine to be an absurdity".
*[[Richard Overy]]; ''The Dictators Hitler's Germany Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004. p. 281 : "Hitler was politically prudent enough not to trumpet his scientific views publicly, not least because he wanted to maintain the distinction between his own movement and the godlessness of Soviet Communism.&amp;nbsp;... What Hitler could not accept was that Christianity could offer anything other than false 'ideas' to sustain its claim to moral certitude."
*Richard Overy: ''The Dictators Hitler's Germany Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004. p. 281: "His few private remarks on Christianity betray a profound contempt and indifference. Forty years afterwards he could still recall facing up to clergyman-teacher at his school when told how unhappy he would be in the afterlife: 'I've heard of a scientist who doubts whether there is a next world'. Hitler believed that all religions were now 'decadent'; in Europe it was the 'collapse of Christianity that we are now experiencing'. The reason for the crisis was science."
*Richard Overy; ''The Third Reich, A Chronicle''; Quercus; 2010; p.99&lt;/ref&gt; Privately, Hitler repeatedly deprecated Christianity, and told confidants that his reluctance to make public attacks on the Church was not a matter of principle, but a pragmatic political move.&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw pp. 295–297"&gt;Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler: a Biography''; Norton; 2008 ed; pp. 295–297.&lt;/ref&gt; In his private diaries, Goebbels wrote in April 1941 that though Hitler was "a fierce opponent" of the Vatican and Christianity, "he forbids me to leave the church.

* Joseph Goebbels (Fred Taylor Translation); The Goebbels Diaries 1939–41; Hamish Hamilton Ltd; London; 1982; p.77: Goebbels wrote on 29 December 1939 "The [[Führer]] is deeply religious, though completely anti-Christian. He views Christianity as a symptom of decay. Rightly so. It is a branch of the Jewish race. This can be seen in the similarity of their religious rites. Both (Judaism and Christianity) have no point of contact to the animal element, and thus, in the end they will be destroyed."
* Joseph Goebbels (Fred Taylor Translation); The Goebbels Diaries 1939–41; Hamish Hamilton Ltd; London; 1982; pp. 304–305 In an 8 April 1941 entry, Goebbels wrote, "[Hitler] hates Christianity, because it has crippled all that is noble in humanity."
* [[Joseph Goebbels]] (Fred Taylor Translation); The Goebbels Diaries 1939–41; Hamish Hamilton Ltd; London; 1982: In his entry for 29 April 1941, Goebbels noted long discussions about the Vatican and Christianity, and wrote: "The Fuhrer is a fierce opponent of all that humbug".

New York: Enigma Books p.48: On 14 October 1941, in an entry concerning the fate of Christianity, Hitler says: "Science cannot lie, for its always striving, according to the momentary state of knowledge, to deduce what is true. When it makes a mistake, it does so in good faith. It's Christianity that's the liar. It's in perpetual conflict with itself."

New York: Enigma Books pp. 59–61: Hitler says: "The dogma of Christianity gets worn away before the advances of science. Religion will have to make more and more concessions. Gradually the myths crumble. All that's left is to prove that in nature there is no frontier between the organic and the inorganic. When understanding of the universe has become widespread, when the majority of men know that the stars are not sources of light but worlds, perhaps inhabited worlds like ours, then the Christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity."
* Albert Speer; ''Inside the Third Reich: Memoirs''; Translation by [[Richard and Clara Winston]]; Macmillan; New York; 1970; p. 123: Speer considered Bormann to be the driving force behind the regime's campaign against the churches and wrote that Hitler approved of Bormann's aims, but was more pragmatic and wanted to "postpone this problem to a more favourable time". He writes: {{"'}}Once I have settled my other problem,' [Hitler] occasionally declared, 'I'll have my reckoning with the church. I'll have it reeling on the ropes.' But Bormann did not want this reckoning postponed&amp;nbsp;... he would take out a document from his pocket and begin reading passages from a defiant sermon or pastoral letter.

[[Alan Bullock]] was an early influential Hitler expert who wrote important biographies of the dictator in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler 1889–1936 Hubris''; Allen Lane/Penguin Press; 1998 pp. xi–xii&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that Hitler had been raised Catholic, and though impressed by its organizational powers, Hitler repudiated Christianity on what he considered to be rational and moral grounds.&lt;ref name="Hitler p219"&gt;[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; Harper Perennial Edition, 1991; p. 219."&lt;/ref&gt; Bullock considered Hitler to be a rationalist and materialist, with no feeling for the spiritual or emotional side of human existence.&lt;ref name="Hitler p219"/&gt; Bullock wrote that Hitler believed neither in "God nor conscience" but found both "justification and absolution" in a view of himself that echoed [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s that heroes were above conventional morality and the role of "world-historical individuals" as the agents by which the "Will of the World Spirit", the plan of Providence is carried out. Following his early military successes, Hitler "abandoned himself entirely to [[megalomania]]" and the "sin of ''[[Hubris|hybris]]''", an exaggerated self-pride, believing himself to be more than a man.&lt;ref name="Hitler p216"&gt;[[Alan Bullock]]; ''[[Hitler: a Study in Tyranny]]''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; pp. 215–216"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[[Alan Bullock]]; ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]'', Harper Perennial Edition 1991, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the war was over, wrote Bullock, Hitler wanted to root out and destroy the influence of the churches, though until then he would be circumspect for political reasons:&lt;ref name="Hitler p219"/&gt;

{{quotation|In Hitler's eyes, Christianity was a religion fit only for slaves; he detested its ethics in particular. Its teaching, he declared, was a rebellion against the natural law of selection by struggle and the survival of the fittest.|[[Alan Bullock]], ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]''}}

At the turn of the century, leading Hitler expert&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2045979.stm Sir Ian Kershaw: Dissecting Hitler]; BBC News; 14 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Kershaw]] wrote an influential biography of Hitler which used new sources to expound on Hitler's religious views. He too concluded that Hitler was anti-Christian and irreligious, but noted how Hitler's religious policy was restrained by political considerations. Still, Hitler's hostility to Christianity contributed to the efforts of his underlings to suppress that religion in Nazi Germany:  "However much Hitler on some occasions claimed to want a respite in the conflict [with the churches], his own inflammatory comments gave his underlings all the license they needed to turn up the heat on the 'Church Struggle', confident that they were working towards the Fuhrer" noted Kershaw:&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw pp.39-40"&gt;Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler 1936–1945 Nemesis''; WW Norton &amp; Company; 2000; pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw pp. 381&amp;ndash;382"&gt;Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; W. W. Norton &amp; Company; London; pp. 381–382&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Hitler's impatience with the churches prompted frequent outbursts of hostility. In early 1937, he was declaring that 'Christianity was ripe for destruction' (''Untergang''), and that the churches must therefore yield to the 'primacy of the state', railing against 'the most horrible institution imaginable'.|[[Ian Kershaw]], ''Hitler 1936–1945: Nemesis''&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw pp.39-40"&gt;[[Ian Kershaw|Kershaw, Ian]] (2000) ''Hitler 1936–1945: Nemesis''. New York: Norton &amp; Company. pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;}}

British historian [[Richard J. Evans]], who writes primarily on Nazi Germany and World War II, believes that Hitler believed in the long run that National Socialism and religion would not be able to co-exist, and that he stressed repeatedly that Nazism was a secular ideology, founded on modern science: "Science, he declared, would easily destroy the last remaining vestiges of superstition' Germany could not tolerate the intervention of foreign influences such as the Pope and 'Priests', he said, were 'black bugs', 'abortions in black cassocks'."&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Evans; ''The Third Reich at War''; Penguin Press; New York 2009, p. 547&lt;/ref&gt; 

British historian [[Richard Overy]], biographer of Hitler, sees Hitler as having been neither a practising Christian, nor a thorough atheist, but also notes the sentiment that Nazism and religion could not co-exist long term: "Both Stalin and Hitler wanted a neutered religion, subservient to the state, while the slow programme of scientific revelation destroyed the foundation of religious myth."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Overy|Overy, Richard]] (2004) ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia''. Allen Lane/Penguin. pp. 281, 287&lt;/ref&gt; Overy writes of Hitler as skeptical of all religious belief, but politically prudent enough not to "trumpet his scientific views publicly", partly in order to maintain the distinction between his own movement and the godlessness of Soviet Communism .&lt;ref name="The Third Reich p.99"&gt;[[Richard Overy]]; ''The Third Reich, A Chronicle''; Quercus; 2010; p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Overy|Overy, Richard]] (2004)''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia''. Allen Lane/Penguin. pp. 280–281&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quotation|He was not a practising Christian but had somehow succeeded in masking his own religious skepticism from millions of German voters. Though Hitler has often been portrayed as a neo-pagan, or the centrepiece of a political religion in which he played the Godhead, his views had much more in common with the revolutionary iconoclasm of the Bolshevik enemy. His few private remarks on Christianity betray a profound contempt and indifference&amp;nbsp;... Hitler believed that all religions were now 'decadent'; in Europe it was the 'collapse of Christianity that we are now experiencing'. The reason for the crisis was science. Hitler, like Stalin took a very modern view of the incompatibility of religious and scientific explanation.|[[Richard Overy]], ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia''}}

Historian [[Percy Ernst Schramm]], describes Hitler's personal religious creed, after his rejection of the Christian beliefs of his youth, as "a variant of the [[monism]] so common before the First World War".&lt;ref name=schramm /&gt; According to Schramm, These views were indirectly influenced by the work of [[Ernst Haeckel]] and his disciple, Wilhelm Bölsche.&lt;ref name=schramm2 /&gt;

Schramm quotes Dr. Hanskarl von Hasselbach, one of Hitler's personal physicians, as saying that Hitler was a "religious person, or at least one who was struggling with religious clarity". According to von Hasselbach, Hitler did not share [[Martin Bormann]]'s conception that Nazi ceremonies could become a substitute for church ceremonies, and was aware of the religious needs of the masses. "He went on for hours discussing the possibility of bridging the confessional division of the German people and helping them find a religion appropriate to their character and modern man's understanding of the world."&lt;ref name=schramm2 /&gt;

Hitler's personal conception of God was as "Providence" ([[divine providence]]).  For instance, when he survived the assassination attempt of [[20 July plot|July 20, 1944]], he ascribed it to Providence saving him to pursue his tasks. In fact, as time went on, Hitler's conception of Providence became more and more intertwined with his belief in his own inability to make an error of judgment. [[Alfred Jodl]] stated at Nuremberg that Hitler had "an almost mystical conviction of his infallibility as leader of the nation and of the war". Another of his physicians, Dr. Karl Brandt, said that Hitler saw himself as a "tool of Providence.  He was&amp;nbsp;... consumed by the desire to give the German people everything and to help them out of their distress. He was possessed by the thought that this was his task and that only he could fulfill it."&lt;ref name=schramm2 /&gt;

BBC historian [[Laurence Rees]] characterises Hitler's relationship to religion as one of opportunism and pragmatism: "his relationship in public to Christianity—indeed his relationship to religion in general—was opportunistic. There is no evidence that Hitler himself, in his personal life, ever expressed any individual belief in the basic tenets of the Christian church".&lt;ref name="Laurence Rees p135"&gt;Laurence Rees; ''The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler''; Ebury Press; 2012; p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Considering the religious allusions found in ''Mein Kampf'', Rees writes that "the most coherent reading of ''Mein Kampf''" is that Hitler was prepared to believe in an initial creator God, but did "not accept the conventional Christian vision of heaven and hell, nor the survival of an individual 'soul'."&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Laurence Rees; ''The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler''; Ebury Press; 2012; p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Domarus]] has written that Hitler replaced belief in the Judeo-Christian God with belief in a peculiarly German "god".&lt;ref name="p. 21"/&gt; He promoted the idea of this god as the creator of Germany, but Hitler "was not a Christian in any accepted meaning of that word."&lt;ref name="HitlerDomarus2007_427"&gt;Domarus, 2007, p. 427&lt;/ref&gt; Domarus writes that Hitler neither believed in organized religion nor saw himself as a religious reformer.&lt;ref name="HitlerDomarus2007_427"/&gt; Hitler had fully discarded belief in the Judeo-Christian conception of God by 1937, writes Domarus, but continued to use the word "God" in speeches&amp;nbsp;— but it was not the God "who has been worshiped for millennia", but a new and peculiarly German "god" who "let iron grow". Thus Hitler told the British journalist Ward Price in 1937: "I believe in God, and I am convinced that He will not desert 67 million Germans who have worked so hard to regain their rightful position in the world."&lt;ref name="p. 21"/&gt;

Although Hitler did not "abide by its commandments", Domarus believed that he retained elements of the Catholic thinking of his upbringing even into the initial years of his rule: "As late as 1933, he still described himself publicly as a Catholic. Only the spreading poison of his lust for power and self idolatry finally crowded out the memories of childhood beliefs and in 1937 he jettisoned the last of his personal religious convictions, declaring to comrades, 'Now I feel as fresh as a colt in the pasture'".&lt;ref name="p. 21"&gt;Max Domarus (2007). ''The Essential Hitler: Speeches and Commentary''. Wauconda: Bolchazy-Carducci, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0Y0UULmcFt0C&amp;pg=PA21 p. 21.]&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Konrad Heiden]] has quoted Hitler as stating, "We do not want any other god than Germany itself. It is essential to have fanatical faith and hope and love in and for Germany."&lt;ref&gt;Heiden, Konrad (1935). ''A History of National Socialism''. A. A. Knopf, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_v59p5CDNa8C&amp;pg=PA100 p. 100.]&lt;/ref&gt; Derek Hastings considers it "eminently plausible" that Hitler was a believing Catholic as late as his trial in 1924, but writes that "there is little doubt that Hitler was a staunch opponent of Christianity throughout the duration of the Third Reich".&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, Derek (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XfQFr0TiLJcC Catholicism and the Roots of Nazism]''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

The biographer [[John Toland (author)|John Toland]], recounts that in the aftermath of an attempted assassination in 1939, Hitler told dinner guests that [[Pope Pius XII]] would rather have seen the "plot succeed" and "was no friend of mine", but also writes that in 1941 Hitler was still "a member in good standing of the Church of Rome despite his detestation of its hierarchy"&lt;ref&gt;John Toland. (1976). ''Adolf Hitler: The Definitive Biography''. New York: Anchor Books, pp. 589, 703.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Guenter Lewy]], Hitler was not [[excommunication|excommunicated]] from the Catholic Church prior to his [[death of Adolf Hitler|death]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Guenter Lewy]]; ''[[Guenter Lewy#The Catholic Church and Nazi Germany|The Catholic Church And Nazi Germany]]''; 1964; p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, these authors seem to have missed the fact that Hitler was in fact excommunicated, along with all other Nazi leaders, in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Scholder, Klaus, ''The Churches and the Third Reich''. 2 vols. Fortress Press, 1988 pp. 150-162&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had received the Catholic sacraments of Baptism, and Confirmation as an infant, there is little evidence he considered himself subject to the teaching of the Church from adolescence onward, whatever cultural affiliation he claimed, and the excommunication would have meant nothing to him. 

[[Samuel Koehne]] of [[Deakin University]] wrote in 2012: "Was Hitler an atheist? Probably not. But it remains very difficult to ascertain his personal religious beliefs, and the debate rages on." While Hitler was emphatically not "Christian" by the traditional or orthodox notion of the term, he did speak of a deity whose work was nature and natural laws, "conflating God and nature to the extent that they became one and the same thing" and that "For this reason, some recent works have argued Hitler was a Deist".&lt;ref name="Koehne"/&gt; In his writings on Hitler's recurrent religious images and symbols, [[Kenneth Burke]] concluded that "Hitler's modes of thought are nothing more than perverted or caricatured forms of religious thought".&lt;ref name="McKnightHughes2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen McKnight|author2=Glenn Hughes|author3=Geoffrey Price|title=Politics, Order and History: Essays on the Work of Eric Voegelin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NeorjnI4VBcC&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;ots=dQnLrLjG2t&amp;dq=friedrich%20heer%20hitler%20political%20religiosity&amp;pg=PA86#v=onepage&amp;q=kenneth%20burke&amp;f=false|date=2001|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-84127-159-0|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Steigmann-Gall]] represents a small minority view, that Hitler was indeed a Christian. He wrote in 2003 that even after Hitler's rupture with institutional Christianity (which he dated to around 1937), he sees evidence that he continued to hold Jesus in high esteem,&lt;ref name="Steigmann-Gall 2003 118–20, 155–6"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity|last=Steigmann-Gall|first=Richard|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-521-82371-4|location=Cambridge|pages=118–20, 155–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and never directed his attacks on [[Jesus]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steigmann-Gall|2003|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the term "[[positive Christianity]]" in the [[National Socialist Program|Nazi Party Program]] of the 1920s is commonly regarded as a tactical measure, but Steigmann-Gall believes it may have had an "inner logic" and been "more than a political ploy".&lt;ref name="pp. 13–50"&gt;Steigmann-Gall, Richard (2003). ''The Holy Reich''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RreXLeUG_AIC&amp;pg=PA13 pp. 13–50, 252.]&lt;/ref&gt; He considers that Hitler was religious at least in the 1920s and early 1930s, and that he saw [[Jesus]] as an [[Aryan]] opponent of the [[Judaism|Jews]].&lt;ref name="steigmann26"&gt;{{Harvnb|Steigmann-Gall|2003|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hitler's remarks to confidants==

===Speer on Hitler's religious beliefs===

In his memoirs, Hitler's confidant, personal architect, and Minister of Armaments [[Albert Speer]], wrote: "Amid his political associates in Berlin, Hitler made harsh pronouncements against the church", yet "he conceived of the church as an instrument that could be useful to him":&lt;ref name="pp 95–96"&gt;''[[Inside the Third Reich|Inside the Third Reich: Memoirs]]''. New York: Simon and Schuster, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XLSa_RIDHMUC&amp;pg=PA96 pp. 95–96.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Around 1937, when Hitler heard that at the instigation of the party and the SS vast numbers of his followers had left the church because it was obstinately opposing his plans, he nevertheless ordered his chief associates, above all Goering and Goebbels, to remain members of the church. He too would remain a member of the Catholic Church he said, although he had no real attachment to it. And in fact he remained in the church until his [[death of Adolf Hitler|suicide]].|Extract from ''[[Inside the Third Reich]]'', the memoir of [[Albert Speer]]}}

The [[Goebbels Diaries]] also remark on this policy. Goebbels wrote on 29 April 1941 that though Hitler was "a fierce opponent" of the Vatican and Christianity, "he forbids me to leave the church. For tactical reasons."&lt;ref name="Fred Taylor Translation p.340"/&gt;

According to Speer, Hitler's private secretary, [[Martin Bormann]], relished recording any harsh pronouncements by Hitler against the church.&lt;ref name="p. 95"&gt;Speer, Albert (1971). ''Inside the Third Reich: Memoirs''. New York: Simon and Schuster. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XLSa_RIDHMUC&amp;pg=PA96 p. 95.] {{ISBN|978-0-684-82949-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Speer considered Bormann to be the driving force behind the regime's campaign against the churches. Speer thought that Hitler approved of Bormann's aims, but was more pragmatic and wanted to "postpone this problem to a more favourable time":&lt;ref name="Albert Speer p.123"&gt;Albert Speer; ''Inside the Third Reich: Memoirs''; Translation by [[Richard and Clara Winston]]; Macmillan; New York; 1970; p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|"Once I have settled my other problem," [Hitler] occasionally declared, "I'll have my reckoning with the church. I'll have it reeling on the ropes." But Bormann did not want this reckoning postponed&amp;nbsp;...  he would take out a document from his pocket and begin reading passages from a defiant sermon or pastoral letter. Frequently Hitler would become so worked up&amp;nbsp;... and vowed to punish the offending clergyman eventually&amp;nbsp;... That he could not immediately retaliate raised him to a white heat&amp;nbsp;...|Extract from ''Inside the Third Reich'', the memoir of Albert Speer}}

Hitler, wrote Speer, viewed Christianity as the wrong religion for the "Germanic temperament":&lt;ref name="pp 95–96"/&gt; Speer wrote that Hitler would say: "You see, it's been our misfortune to have the wrong religion. Why didn't we have [[Shinto|the religion]] of the [[Japanese people|Japanese]], who regard sacrifice for the fatherland as the highest good? The [[Islam|Mohammedan religion]] too would have been much more compatible to us than Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness and flabbiness?"&lt;ref&gt;Speer, Albert (1971). ''Inside the Third Reich''.  Trans. [[Richard and Clara Winston|Richard Winston, Clara Winston]], Eugene Davidson. New York: Macmillan, p. 143; Reprinted in 1997. ''Inside the Third Reich: Memoirs''. New York: Simon and Schuster. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XLSa_RIDHMUC&amp;pg=PA96 p. 96.] {{ISBN|978-0-684-82949-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Speer also wrote of observing in Hitler "quite a few examples", and that he held a negative view toward Himmler and Rosenberg's mystical notions.&lt;ref name="p. 94"&gt;[[Inside the Third Reich]]: Memoirs of [[Albert Speer]]; New York: Simon and Schuster, [https://archive.org/details/Inside_the_Third_Reich_Albert_Speer p. 94]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Albert Speer; ''Inside the Third Reich: Memoirs''; Translation by [[Richard and Clara Winston]]; Macmillan Publishing Company; New York; 1970; p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bormann on Hitler's religious beliefs===

[[Martin Bormann]], who was serving as Hitler's private secretary, persuaded Hitler to allow a team of specially picked officers to record in [[shorthand]] his private conversations for posterity.&lt;ref name="Trevor-Roper2000vii"&gt;Trevor-Roper, H.R. (2000). ''Hitler's Table Talk 1941–1944''. New York: Enigma Books, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fk-aXlliu6cC&amp;pg=PR17 p. vii.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1941 and 1944, Hitler's words were recorded in transcripts now known as ''[[Hitler's Table Talk]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-215448 Encyclopædia Britannica - Reflections on the Holocaust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224103223/http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-215448 |date=2013-12-24 }}; ''Hitler, Adolf: Additional Reading - Writings and speeches; web May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The transcripts concern not only Hitler's views on war and foreign affairs, but also his characteristic attitudes on religion, culture, philosophy, personal aspirations, and his feelings towards his enemies and friends.{{sfn|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007}}  Speer noted in his memoirs that Bormann relished recording any harsh pronouncements made by Hitler against the church: "there was hardly anything he wrote down more eagerly than deprecating comments on the church".&lt;ref name="p. 95"/&gt; Within the transcripts, Hitler speaks of Christianity as "absurdity" and "humbug" founded on "lies" with which he could "never come personally to terms."{{sfn|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|pp=59, 342, 343}}

The widespread consensus among historians is that the views expressed in [[Trevor-Roper]]'s translation of ''Table Talk'', are credible and reliable, although as with all historical sources, a high level of critical awareness about its origins and purpose are advisable.&lt;ref name="Kershaw"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hitler 1889-1936: Hubris|last=Kershaw|first=Ian|publisher=Penguin|year=2001|isbn=978-0-14-013363-9|location=London|pages=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remarks from ''Table Talk'' accepted as genuine include such quotes as "Christianity is the prototype of Bolshevism: the mobillization by the Jew of the masses of slaves with the object of undermining society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|title=The Third Reich at War: How the Nazis led Germany from conquest to disaster|year=2008|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=978-0-14-101548-4|pages=547 (546–9)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Bullock's seminal biography ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]'' quotes Hitler as saying, "Taken to its logical extreme, Christianity would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure"; found also in ''Table Talk'',{{sfn|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|p=55}} and repeats other views appearing in Table Talk such as: the teachings of Christianity are a rebellion against the natural law of selection by struggle and survival of the fittest.&lt;ref name="Hitler p.216 &amp; 219"&gt;See Alan Bullock; [[Hitler: a Study in Tyranny]]; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219 &amp; {{harvnb|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Burleigh]] contrasted Hitler's public pronouncements on Christianity with those in ''Table Talk'', suggesting that Hitler's real religious views were "a mixture of materialist biology, a faux-[[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] contempt for core, as distinct from secondary, Christian values, and a visceral anti-clericalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burleigh|first=Michael|title=The Third Reich - A New History|year=2001|publisher=Pan Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-330-48757-3|pages=716–717}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Evans also reiterated the view that Nazism was secular, scientific and anti-religious in outlook in the last volume of his trilogy on Nazi Germany: "Hitler's hostility to Christianity reached new heights, or depths, during the war;" his source for this was the 1953 English translation of ''Table Talk''.&lt;ref name="Evans 2008 547–8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|title=The Third Reich at War: How the Nazis led Germany from conquest to disaster|year=2008|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=978-0-14-101548-4|pages=547–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Table Talk'' has the dictator often voicing stridently negative views of Christianity, such as: "The heaviest blow that ever struck humanity was the coming of Christianity. [[Bolshevism]] is Christianity's illegitimate child. Both are inventions of the Jew. The deliberate lie in the matter of religion was introduced into the world by Christianity."{{sfn|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|p=8}}

Transcripts contained in ''Table Talk'' have Hitler expressing faith that science would wear away religion. On 14 October 1941, in an entry concerning the fate of Christianity, Hitler says: "Science cannot lie, for it's always striving, according to the momentary state of knowledge, to deduce what is true. When it makes a mistake, it does so in good faith. It's Christianity that's the liar. It's in perpetual conflict with itself."{{sfn|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|p=48}} Religion will crumble before scientific advances, says Hitler: "The dogma of Christianity gets worn away before the advances of science. Religion will have to make more and more concessions. Gradually the myths crumble. All that's left is to prove that in nature there is no frontier between the organic and the inorganic. When understanding of the universe has become widespread, when the majority of men know that the stars are not sources of light but worlds, perhaps inhabited worlds like ours, then the Christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity."{{sfn|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|pp=59–61}}

Hitler wanted his movement aloof from religion, fearing a pact with the churches would collapse: "I'm convinced that any pact with the Church can offer only a provisional benefit, for sooner or later the scientific spirit will disclose the harmful character of such a compromise. Thus the State will have based its existence on a foundation that one day will collapse. An educated man retains the sense of the mysteries of nature and bows before the unknowable. An uneducated man, on the other hand, runs the risk of going over to atheism (which is a return to the state of the animal) as soon as he perceives that the State, in sheer opportunism, is making use of false ideas in the matter of religion, whilst in other fields it bases everything on pure science. That's why I've always kept the Party aloof from religious questions."&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, Hugh, ed (2000). ''Hitler's Table Talk 1941–1944''. Trans. N. Cameron and R. H. Stevens (3rd ed.). New York: Engima Books. Midday 14th October 1941: "I'm convinced that any pact with the Church can offer only a provisional benefit, for sooner or later the scientific spirit will disclose the harmful character of such a compromise. Thus the State will have based its existence on a foundation that one day will collapse. An educated man retains the sense of the mysteries of nature and bows before the unknowable.

That's why I've always kept the Party aloof from religious questions."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Table Talk'', Hitler believed that Jesus' true Christian teachings had been corrupted by the [[apostle (Christian)|apostle]] [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]], who had transformed them into a kind of Jewish [[Bolshevik|Bolshevism]], which Hitler believed preached "the equality of all men amongst themselves, and their obedience to an only god. This is what caused the death of the Roman Empire."{{sfn|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|p=76}}{{sfn|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|pp=721–722}}

In ''Table Talk'', Hitler praised [[Julian the Apostate]]'s ''[[Libri tres contra Galileos|Three Books Against the Galilaeans]]'', an anti-Christian tract from [[Anno Domini|AD]] 362, in the entry dated 21 October 1941, stating: "When one thinks of the opinions held concerning Christianity by our best minds a hundred, two hundred years ago, one is ashamed to realise how little we have since evolved. I didn't know that Julian the Apostate had passed judgment with such clear-sightedness on Christianity and Christians. ... Originally, Christianity was merely an incarnation of Bolshevism the destroyer. Nevertheless, the Galilean, who later was called the Christ, intended something quite different. He must be regarded as a popular leader who took up His position against Jewry.... and it's certain that Jesus was not a Jew. The Jews, by the way, regarded Him as the son of a whore—of a whore and a Roman soldier. The decisive falsification of Jesus's doctrine was the work of St. Paul. He gave himself to this work with subtlety and for purposes of personal exploitation. For the Galilean's object was to liberate His country from Jewish oppression. He set Himself against Jewish capitalism, and that's why the Jews liquidated Him. Paul of Tarsus (his name was Saul, before the road to Damascus) was one of those who persecuted Jesus most savagely."{{sfn|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|p=76}}

Richard Carrier made some isolated comparisons of passages from the German, French and English editions of Table Talk, and found in each case that the English edition by Trevor-Roper was a translation of the French edition by Francois Genoud, rather than from the German editions; and also that the French translation contained significant distortions, which generally heightened the impression of Hitler's hatred for Christianity. Carrier concluded that "the Trevor-Roper edition is to be discarded as worthless." However, Carrier found that three German versions "have a common ancestor, which must be the actual bunker notes themselves", and recommended that scholars needed to work directly with the German editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carrier|first=Richard|date=2003|title=Hitler's Table Talk: Troubling Finds|jstor=1432747|journal=German Studies Review|volume=26|issue=3|pages=561–576|doi=10.2307/1432747|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his introduction to a 2013 edition of Trevor-Roper's Table Talk, Gerhard Reinberg agreed that the Trevor-Roper edition "derives from Genoud's French edition and not from either of the German texts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIbqZ_F5UhkC|title=Hitler's Table Talk 1941-1944: Secret Conversations|last=Trevor-Roper|first=Hugh Redwald|last2=Weinberg|first2=Gerhard L.|date=2013-10-18|publisher=Enigma Books|isbn=9781929631667|page=xi|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After examining Trevor-Roper's personal correspondence and papers, Mikael Nilsson concluded that Trevor-Roper was fully aware of the fact that his edition was based on the French text, but failed to reveal the problems in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nilsson|first=Mikael|date=2016-03-10|title=Hugh Trevor-Roper and the English editions of Hitler's Table Talk and Testament|url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-260927|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|language=en|pages=0022009415619689|doi=10.1177/0022009415619689|issn=0022-0094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goebbels on Hitler's religious beliefs===

The ''[[Goebbels Diaries]]'', written by Hitler's Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]], provide important insights into Hitler's thinking and actions.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw; Hitler 1889-1936 Hubris; Allen Lane/Penguin Press; 1998 p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; In a diary entry of 28 December 1939, Goebbels wrote that "the Fuhrer passionately rejects any thought of founding a religion. He has no intention of becoming a priest. His sole exclusive role is that of a politician."&lt;ref name="Fred Taylor Translation p.76"&gt;Fred Taylor Translation; ''The Goebbels Diaries 1939–41; Hamish Hamilton Ltd; London; 1982; {{ISBN|0-241-10893-4}}; p.76&lt;/ref&gt; In an 8 April 1941 entry, Goebbels wrote "He hates Christianity, because it has crippled all that is noble in humanity."&lt;ref name="Fred Taylor Translation pp. 304–305"&gt;Fred Taylor Translation; The Goebbels Diaries 1939–41; Hamish Hamilton Ltd; London; 1982; {{ISBN|0-241-10893-4}}; pp. 304 305: Goebbels wrote in 1941 that Hitler "hates Christianity" because it had made humans abject and weak, and also because the faith exalted the dignity of human life, while disregarding the rights and well-being of animals.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Goebbels noted Hitler's approval of anti-Christian propaganda and the show trials of clergy. Hitler's impatience with the churches, wrote Kershaw, "prompted frequent outbursts of hostility. In early 1937 he was declaring that 'Christianity was ripe for destruction', and that the Churches must yield to the "primacy of the state", railing against any compromise with "the most horrible institution imaginable".&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw pp. 295–297"/&gt; In his entry for 29 April 1941, Goebbels noted long discussions about the Vatican and Christianity, and wrote: "The Fuhrer is a fierce opponent of all that humbug".&lt;ref name="Fred Taylor Translation p.340"/&gt;

In 1939, Goebbels wrote that the Fuhrer knew that he would "have to get around to a conflict between church and state" but that in the meantime "The best way to deal with the churches is to claim to be a 'positive Christian'."&lt;ref name="Fred Taylor Translation p.76"/&gt;

In another entry, Goebbels wrote that Hitler was "deeply religious but entirely anti-Christian".&lt;ref&gt;Bonney, Richard (2009). ''Confronting the Nazi war on Christianity: the Kulturkampf newsletters, 1936–1939'' Bern, Switzerland: Peter Lang Pub., [https://books.google.com/books?id=KuiPXOje7EkC&amp;pg=PA20 p. 20.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Peter (2009). ''Adolf Hitler: The Definitive Biography''. New York: Anchor Books, p. 703.&lt;/ref&gt; Goebbels wrote on 29 December 1939:&lt;ref name="Goebbels diaries pp. 77"&gt;Fred Taylor Translation; The Goebbels Diaries 1939–41; Hamish Hamilton Ltd; London; 1982; {{ISBN|0-241-10893-4}}; p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

The Führer is a convinced vegetarian on principle.|[[Goebbels Diaries]], 29 December 1939}}

Goebbels notes in a diary entry in 1939 a conversation in which Hitler had "expressed his revulsion against Christianity. He wished that the time were ripe for him to be able to openly express that. Christianity had corrupted and infected the entire world of antiquity."&lt;ref&gt;Elke Frölich. 1997–2008. ''Die Tagebücher von Joseph Goebbels''. Munich: K. G. Sauer. Teil I, v. 6, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler, wrote Goebbels, saw the pre-Christian [[Augustus|Augustan Age]] as the high point of history, and could not relate to the Gothic mind nor to "brooding mysticism".&lt;ref name="Fred Taylor Translation pp. 304–305"/&gt;

The diaries also report that Hitler believed Jesus "also wanted to act against the Jewish world domination. Jewry had him crucified. But [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] falsified his doctrine and undermined ancient Rome."&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, Saul (2009). ''Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1933–1945''.

=== Ernst Hanfstaengl and Otto Strasser on Hitler's religious beliefs ===
Otto Strasser was a German politician and an early member of the Nazi Party, he together with his brother Gregor Strasser, was a leading member of the party's left-wing faction. During the conversation with his brother, he stated that he was disappointed with Hitler because&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hitler's Religion|last=Weikart|first=Richard|publisher=Regenery History|year=2016|isbn=9781621575009|location=|pages=XI}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

Ernst Hanfstaengl was a German-American businessman and intimate friend of [[Adolf Hitler]]. He eventually fell out of favour with Hitler, however, and defected from [[Nazi Germany]] to the [[United States]]. When he wrote down Hitler's religious views, he stated, like Otto Strasser, that Adof Hitler was an atheist&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=0xUnAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT60&amp;lpg=PT60&amp;dq=Ernst+Hanfstaengl+was+to+all+intents+and+purposes+an+atheist+by+the+time+I+got+to+know+him&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7ukdKTcSWC&amp;sig=oaUzZcjuCwRLwwd4BsgTd__3XNM&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiR5-C4zrHeAhUCVywKHQFvAfgQ6AEwAnoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Hitler: The Memoir of the Nazi Insider Who Turned Against the Fuhrer|last=Hanfstaengl|first=Ernst|publisher=Arcade Publishing; Reprint edition|year=2011|isbn=1611450551|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

===Other sources on Hitler's religious beliefs===

The [[Anschluss]] saw the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in early 1938. The Austrian chancellor, [[Kurt von Schuschnigg]], had traveled to Germany to meet Hitler, who, according to Schuschnigg's later testimony, went into a threatening rage against the role of Austria in German history, saying, "Every national idea was sabotaged by Austria throughout history; and indeed all this sabotage was the chief activity of the Habsburgs and the Catholic Church." This ended in Hitler's ultimatum to end Austrian independence and hand the nation to the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker &amp; Warburg; London; 1960; pp. 325–329.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1944 assassination attempt in the "[[20 July plot]]", Hitler credited his survival to fate in a radio broadcast the following day. German deputy press chief [[Helmut Suendermann]] declared, "The German people must consider the failure of the attempt on Hitler's life as a sign that Hitler will complete his tasks under the protection of a divine power".&lt;ref&gt;BBC News (1944-07-20) Hitler survives assassination attempt. http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/20/newsid_3505000/3505014.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a meeting with Hitler, Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]], a man who had "courageously criticized the Nazi attacks on the Catholic Church—went away convinced that Hitler was deeply religious", noted Kershaw.&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw p. 373"/&gt; In November 1936 the Roman Catholic prelate met Hitler at [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]] for a three-hour meeting. He left the meeting and wrote "The Reich Chancellor undoubtedly lives in belief in God. He recognises Christianity as the builder of Western culture".&lt;ref&gt;Hitler, Ian Kershaw, p. 373, 2008, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0-14-103588-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kershaw cites Faulhaber's case as an example of Hitler's ability to "pull the wool over the eyes of even hardened critics", demonstrating Hitler's "evident ability to simulate, even to potentially critical church leaders, an image of a leader keen to uphold and protect Christianity".&lt;ref name="Kershaw109"&gt;Kershaw, Ian (2001).

Adolf Hitler was raised in a Roman Catholic family in Habsburg Austria. However, reliable historical details on his childhood are scarce. According to Hitler historian [[Ian Kershaw]], the reflections Hitler provided on his own life in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' are "inaccurate in detail and coloured in interpretation", while information that was given during the Nazi period is "dubious", as can be the postwar recollections of family and acquaintances.&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw p.3"&gt;Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler a Biography''; 2008 ed; Norton; London; p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler was baptised as a Catholic in the same year he was born, 1889.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/267992/Adolf-Hitler Encyclopedia Online - ''Adolf Hitler'']&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's father [[Alois Hitler|Alois]], though nominally a [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]], was somewhat [[Religious skepticism|religiously skeptical]] and anticlerical,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Bradley  (1967).

Stanford: Hoover Institution Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=If67AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Closely+related+to+his+support+of%22 p. 27.] "Closely related to his support of education was his tolerant skepticism concerning religion. He looked upon religion as a series of conventions and as a crutch for human weakness, but, like most of his neighbors, he insisted that the women of his household fulfil all religious obligations. He restricted his own participation to donning his uniform to take his proper place in festivals and processions. As he grew older, Alois shifted from relative passivity in his attitude toward the power and influence of the institutional Church to a firm opposition to 'clericalism', especially when the position of the Church came into conflict with his views on education."&lt;/ref&gt; while his mother [[Klara Hitler|Klara]] was a devout practising Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Bradley  (1967).

Stanford: Hoover Institution Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=If67AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Alois+insisted+she+attend+regularly%22 p. 42.] "Alois insisted she attend regularly as an expression of his belief that the woman's place was in the kitchen and in church&amp;nbsp;... Happily, Klara really enjoyed attending services and was completely devoted to the faith and teachings of Catholicism, so her husband's requirements worked to her advantage."&lt;/ref&gt; [[A.N. Wilson|Wilson]] wrote: "Much is sometimes made of the Catholic upbringing of Hitler&amp;nbsp;... it was something to which Hitler himself often made allusion, and he was nearly always violently hostile.

Forty years afterwards he could still recall facing up to clergyman-teacher at his school when told how unhappy he would be in the afterlife: 'I've heard of a scientists who doubts whether there is a next world'. Hitler believed that all religions were now 'decadent'; in Europe it was the 'collapse of Christianity that we are now experiencing'. The reason for the crisis was science."&lt;/ref&gt; He attended several primary schools. For six months, the family lived opposite a Benedictine Monastery at Lambach, and on some afternoons, Hitler attended the choir school there.&lt;ref name=Toland9&gt;John Toland; ''Hitler''; Wordsworth Editions; 1997 Edn; p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler later wrote in ''Mein Kampf'' that at this time he dreamed of one day taking [[holy orders]].&lt;ref name="Shirer1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=William L.

By his account in ''Mein Kampf'' (which is often an unreliable source), he loved the "solemn splendor of the brilliant Church festivals". He held the abbot in very high regard, and later told Helene Hanfstaengl that one time as a small boy he had once ardently wished to become a priest. His flirtation with the idea apparently ended as suddenly as it began, however. (Ibid.)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hitler was [[confirmation (Catholic Church)|confirmed]] on 22 May 1904. According to Rissmann, as a youth Hitler was influenced by [[Pan-Germanism]] and began to reject the [[Catholic Church]], receiving [[confirmation (Catholic Church)|confirmation]] only unwillingly.&lt;ref name="Michael Rissmann 2001, pp. 94–96"&gt;Rissmann, Michael (2001). ''Hitlers Gott: Vorsehungsglaube und Sendungsbewußtsein des deutschen Diktators''. Zürich, München: Pendo, pp. 94–96; {{ISBN|978-3-85842-421-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[John Toland]] wrote of the 1904 ceremony at Linz Cathedral that Hitler's confirmation sponsor said he nearly had to "drag the words out of him... almost as though the whole confirmation was repugnant to him".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Rissmann notes that, according to several witnesses who lived with Hitler in a men's home in Vienna, Hitler never again attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or received the [[sacrament]]s after leaving home.&lt;ref name="Michael Rissmann 2001, pp. 94–96"/&gt; &lt;!-- Can we find an English source for this? --&gt; 

In 1909, Hitler moved to Vienna and according to [[Alan Bullock|Bullock]] his intellectual interests there vacillated and his reading included "[[Ancient Rome]], the [[Eastern religions]], [[Yoga]], [[Occult]]ism, [[Hypnosis|Hypnotism]], [[Astrology]], [[Protestantism]], each in turn excited his interest for a moment&amp;nbsp;... He struck people as unbalanced. He gave rein to his hatreds—against the Jews, the priests, the [[Social democracy|Social Democrats]], the Habsburgs—without restraint".&lt;ref name="Alan Bullock p11"&gt;Alan Bullock; ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]''; Harper Perennial Edition 1991; p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Percy Ernst Schramm]]'s "The Anatomy of a Dictator", which was based on an analysis of the transcripts of the "Table Talk" recordings, Hitler is quoted as saying that "after a hard inner struggle" he had freed himself from the religious beliefs of his youth, so that he felt "as fresh as a foal in the pasture".&lt;ref name=schramm&gt;[[Percy Ernst Schramm|Schramm, Percy Ernst]] (1978) "The Anatomy of a Dictator" in ''Hitler: The Man and the Military Leader''.

===Adulthood and political career===

====Hitler's public rhetoric and writings about religion====

Although personally skeptical, Hitler's public relationship to religion was one of opportunistic pragmatism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In religious affairs he readily adopted a strategy "that suited his immediate political purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Conway, John S. (1968). ''The Nazi Persecution of the Churches 1933–45''. p. 3, {{ISBN|978-0-297-76315-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He typically tailored his message to his audience's perceived sensibilities and Kershaw considers that few people could really claim to "know" Hitler, who was "a very private, even secretive individual", able to deceive "even hardened critics" as to his true beliefs.&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw p. 373"&gt;Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler: a Biography''; Norton; 2008 ed; p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Court2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Court|title=Hannah Arendt's Response to the Crisis of Her Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s8VaZd5KjwsC&amp;pg=PA97|accessdate=2013-04-22|year=2008|publisher=Rozenberg Publishers|isbn=978-90-361-0100-4|pages=97–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In private, he scorned Christianity, but when out campaigning for power in Germany, he made statements in favour of the religion.&lt;ref name="Paul Berben p. 138"&gt;Paul Berben; ''Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945''; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; {{ISBN|0-85211-009-X}}; p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler's public utterances were peppered with references to "God" and "Spirit".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy: The Dictators Hitler's Germany Stalin's Russia; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004.p.281&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hitler wusste selber durch die ständige Anrufung des Herrgotts oder der Vorsehung den Eindruck gottesfürchtiger Denkart zu machen." J. C. Fest. ''Hitler''. (German edition), p. 581.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]'', Bullock wrote that Hitler, like [[Napoleon]] before him, frequently employed the language of "[[divine providence]]" in defence of his own personal myth, but ultimately shared with the Soviet dictator [[Joseph Stalin]] "the same materialist outlook, based on the nineteenth century rationalists' certainty that the progress of science would destroy all myths and had already proved Christian doctrine to be an absurdity":&lt;ref name="Stalin pp.412"&gt;[[Alan Bullock]], ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]'', Fontana Press 1993, p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stalin pp.413"&gt;[[Alan Bullock]]; ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]''; Fontana Press; 1993; p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Hitler's own myth had to be protected, and this led him, like Napoleon, to speak frequently of Providence, as a necessary if unconscious projection of his sense of destiny which provided him with both justification and absolution. 'The Russians', he remarked on one occasion 'were entitled to attack their priests, but they had no right to assail the idea of a supreme force. It's a fact that we're feeble creatures and that a creative force exists'".|Excerpt from ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]'' by Alan Bullock}}

Hitler had an "ability to simulate, even to potentially critical Church leaders, an image of a leader keen to uphold and protect Christianity [from Bolshevism]" wrote Kershaw, which served to deflect direct criticism of him from Church leaders, who instead focused their condemnations on the known "anti-Christian party radicals".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kershaw|1987|p=109}}&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;"Hitler's evident ability to simulate, even to potentially critical Church leaders, an image of a leader keen to uphold and protect Christianity was crucial to the mediation of such an image to the church-going public by influential members of both major denominations. It was the reason why church-going Christians, so often encouraged by their 'opinion-leaders' in the Church hierarchies, were frequently able to exclude Hitler from their condemnation of the anti-Christian Party radicals, continuing to see in him the last hope of protecting Christianity from Bolshevism."&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Religion in ''Mein Kampf''=====
In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1924-25), which was written while he was in prison after his failed 1923 putsch, Hitler combined elements of autobiography with an exposition of his racist political ideology .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/373362/Mein-Kampf Encyclopædia Britannica Online - ''Mein Kampf'']; web 24 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The personal reflections contained within ''Mein Kampf'' are nevertheless inaccurate and unreliable.&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw p.3"/&gt; In the work, Hitler uses the words "God", "the Creator", "Providence" and "the Lord".&lt;ref name="Mein Kampf pp. 307"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mein Kampf pp. 65"&gt;Hitler, Adolf (1999) ''Mein Kampf''. Trans. Ralph Manheim. New York: Mariner Books, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mein Kampf pp. 562"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MeinKampf"/&gt;

[[Laurence Rees]] described the thrust of the work as "bleak [[nihilism]]" revealing a cold universe with no moral structure other than the fight between different people for supremacy: "What's missing from ''Mein Kampf''", wrote Rees—"and this is a fact that has not received the acknowledgement it should—is any emphasis on Christianity"—though Germany, Rees noted, had been Christian for a thousand years. So, concluded Rees, "the most coherent reading of ''Mein Kampf'' is that whilst Hitler was prepared to believe in an initial creator God, he did not accept the conventional Christian vision of heaven and hell, nor the survival of an individual "soul"&amp;nbsp;... we are animals and just like animals we face the choice of destroying or being destroyed."&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

Paul Berben wrote that insofar as the Christian denominations were concerned, Hitler declared himself to be neutral in Mein Kampf—but argued for clear separation of church and state, and for the church not to concern itself with the earthly life of the people, which must be the domain of the state.&lt;ref name="Paul Berben p. 138"/&gt; According to [[William Shirer]], Hitler "inveighed against political Catholicism in ''Mein Kampf'' and attacked the two main Christian churches for their failure to recognise the racial problem", while also warning that no political party could succeed in "producing a religious reformation".&lt;ref name="William L. Shirer p. 234"/&gt;

In ''Mein Kampf'' Hitler wrote that Jesus "made no secret of his attitude toward the Jewish people, and when necessary he even took the whip to drive from the temple of the Lord this adversary of all humanity, who then as always saw in religion nothing but an instrument for his business existence. In return, Christ was nailed to the cross."&lt;ref name="Mein Kampf pp. 307"&gt;Hitler, Adolf (1998). ''Mein Kampf''. Trans. Ralph Manheim. New York: Houghton Mifflin, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler wrote of the importance of a definite and uniformly accepted ''Weltanschauung'' (world view), and noted that the diminished position of religion in Europe had led to a decline in necessary certainties—"yet this human world of ours would be inconceivable without the practical existence of religious belief". The various substitutes hitherto offered could not "usefully replace the existing denominations".&lt;ref name="Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mein Kampf|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200601.txt|website=gutenberg.net.au|publisher=Project Gutenberg Australia|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The political leader should not estimate the worth of a religion by taking some of its shortcomings into account, but he should ask himself whether there be any practical substitute in a view which is demonstrably better. Until such a substitute be available, only fools and criminals would think of abolishing existing religion.|Adolf Hitler, ''[[Mein Kampf]]''}}

Examining how to establish a new order, Hitler argued that the greatness of powerful organizations was reliant on intolerance of all others, so that the greatness of Christianity arose from the "unrelenting and fanatical proclamation and defence of its own teaching". Hitler rejected a view that Christianity brought civilization to the Germanic peoples, however: "It is therefore outrageously unjust to speak of the pre-Christian Germans as barbarians who had no civilization. They never have been such." Foreshadowing his conflict with the Catholic Church over [[euthanasia in Nazi Germany]], Hitler wrote that the churches should give up missionary work in Africa, and concentrate on convincing Europeans that is more pleasing to God if they adopt orphans rather than "give life to a sickly child that will be a cause of suffering and unhappiness to all".&lt;ref name="Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf"/&gt; The Christian churches should forget about their own differences and focus on the issue of "racial contamination", he declared.&lt;ref name="Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf"/&gt;

{{quotation|The two Christian denominations look on with indifference at the profanation and destruction of a noble and unique creature who was given to the world as a gift of God's grace. For the future of the world, however, it does not matter which of the two triumphs over the other, the Catholic or the Protestant. But it does matter whether Aryan humanity survives or perishes.|Adolf Hitler, ''Mein Kampf''}}

When he arrived in [[Vienna]] as a young man, Hitler claimed, he was not yet anti-Semitic: "In the Jew I still saw only a man who was of a different religion, and therefore, on grounds of human tolerance, I was against the idea that he should be attacked because he had a different faith."&lt;ref&gt;Hitler, Adolf (1999) ''Mein Kampf''. Trans. Ralph Manheim. New York: Mariner Books, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that anti-Semitism based on religious, rather than racial grounds, was a mistake: "The anti-Semitism of the Christian-Socialists was based on religious instead of racial principles." Instead, Hitler argued that Jews should be deplored on the basis of their "race".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200601.txt Mein Kampf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to justify Nazi aggression, Hitler drew a parallel between [[militant (word)|militantism]] and Christianity's rise to power as the [[Roman Empire]]'s official [[state religion]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The individual may establish with pain today that with the appearance of Christianity the first spiritual terror entered into the far freer ancient world, but he will not be able to contest the fact that since then the world has been afflicted and dominated by this coercion, and that coercion is broken only by coercion, and terror only by terror. Only then can a new state of affairs be constructively created. Political parties are inclined to compromises; philosophies never. Political parties even reckon with opponents; philosophies proclaim their infallibility."&lt;ref&gt;Hitler, Adolf (1969). ''Mein Kampf''. McLeod, MN: Hutchinson, p. 562.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elsewhere in ''Mein Kampf,'' Hitler speaks of the "creator of the universe" and "eternal Providence".&lt;ref name="MeinKampf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=''[[Mein Kampf]]'' |author1=Ralph Manheim, ed. |author2=Adolf Hitler |location=New York |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1998 |isbn= 0395951054 |page=65 |quote=Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also states that the Aryan race was created by God, and that it would be a sin to dilute it through racial intermixing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The völkisch-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in his own denomination, of making people stop just talking superficially of God's will, and actually fulfill God's will, and not let God's word be desecrated. For God's will gave men their form, their essence and their abilities. Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the Lord's creation, the divine will."&lt;ref name="Mein Kampf pp. 562"&gt;Hitler, Adolf (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yaHtAAAAMAAJ ''Mein Kampf'']. Trans. Ralph Manheim. New York: Mariner Books, p. 562.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Mein Kampf, Hitler saw Jesus as against the Jews rather than one of them: "And the founder of Christianity made no secret indeed of his estimation of the Jewish people. When He found it necessary, He drove those enemies of the human race out of the Temple of God."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Manheim, ed. (1998). Mein Kampf. New York: Houghton Mifflin. {{ISBN|0-395-95105-4}}, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Hitler on Christianity and "Positive Christianity"=====

Article 24 of Hitler's [[National Socialist Programme]] of 1920 had endorsed what it termed "[[Positive Christianity]]", but placed religion below party ideology by adding the caveat that it must not offend "the moral sense of the German race".&lt;ref name="Richard Overy 2004. p.285"&gt;Richard Overy; ‘’The Dictators Hitler's Germany Stalin's Russia’’; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004. p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Non-denominational, the term could be variously interpreted, but allayed fears among Germany's Christian majority as to the oft expressed anti-Christian convictions of large sections of the Nazi movement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Laurence Rees; ''The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler''; Ebury Press; 2012; p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; It further proposed a definition of a "[[positive Christianity]]" which could combat the "Jewish-materialistic spirit".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005206 United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]; ''The German Churches and the Nazi State''; web 25 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, a decade before Hitler took power, former [[Prime Minister]] of [[Bavaria]], Count [[Hugo Graf von und zu Lerchenfeld auf Köfering und Schönberg|von Lerchenfeld-Köfering]] stated in a speech before the [[Landtag of Bavaria]], that his beliefs "as a man and a Christian" prevented him from being an anti-Semite or from pursuing anti-Semitic public policies. Hitler turned Lerchenfeld's perspective of Jesus on its head, telling a crowd in Munich:

{{quotation|"I would like here to appeal to a greater than I, Count Lerchenfeld. He said in the last session of the Landtag that his feeling 'as a man and a Christian' prevented him from being an anti-Semite. I say: My feeling as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded only by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was his fight against the Jewish poison. Today, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed his blood upon the Cross. As a Christian, I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice."&lt;ref name="Speech Munich 1922"&gt;Speech delivered at Munich 12 April 1922; from Norman H. Baynes, ed. (1942). ''The Speeches of Adolf Hitler: April 1922 – August 1939''. Vol. 1. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 1928 speech, he said: "We tolerate no one in our ranks who attacks the ideas of Christianity&amp;nbsp;... in fact our movement is Christian."&lt;ref&gt;Speech in Passau 27 October 1928 Bundesarchiv Berlin-Zehlendorf; from Richard Steigmann-Gall (2003). ''Holy Reich: Nazi conceptions of Christianity, 1919–1945''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of later developments, Rees notes, "The most persuasive explanation of [Hitler's] statements is that Hitler, as a politician, simply recognised the practical reality of the world he inhabited&amp;nbsp;... Had Hitler distanced himself or his movement too much from Christianity it is all but impossible to see how he could ever have been successful in a free election. Thus his relationship in public to Christianity—indeed his relationship to religion in general—was opportunistic. There is no evidence that Hitler himself, in his personal life, ever expressed any individual belief in the basic tenets of the Christian church".&lt;ref name="Laurence Rees p135"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Richard Evans considers that the gap between Hitler's public and private pronouncements was due to a desire not to cause a quarrel with the churches that might undermine national unity.&lt;ref name="Evans 2008 547–8" /&gt;

In 1932, Hitler came up with the name German Christians (''Deutsche Christen'') for a pro-Nazi group within Protestantism. "Hitler saw the relationship in political terms. He was not a praticising Christian, but had somehow succeeded in masking his own religious skepticism from millions of German voters", wrote [[Richard Overy|Overy]], who considered that Hitler found the arrangement useful for a time, but ultimately expected Christianity to wilt and die before "the advances of science".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy; ''The Dictators Hitler's Germany Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004. p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; In this early period, the "German Christian" movement sought to make the Protestant churches in Germany an instrument of Nazi policy.&lt;ref name="Christian Church 1960 pp. 235"&gt;"Confessing Church" in ''Dictionary of the Christian Church'', F.

This book is a Spanish translation corresponding to Michael Power, ''Religion in the Reich: the Nazi Persecution of Christianity, an Eye Witness Report'' (n.p.: Longman´s Green and Co. Ltd., 1939).&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler backed the formal establishment of the "[[German Christians]]" in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Power, ''La persecución Nazi contra el cristianismo'' (Buenos Aires: Editorial Difusión, 1941), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; It was nationalistic and anti-Semitic and some of its radicals called for repudiation of the Old Testament (the Hebrew Scriptures) and the [[Pauline epistles]] of the New Testament—because of their Jewish authorship.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/230654/German-Christian Encyclopædia Britannica Online - ''German Christian'']; web 25 Apr 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler's movement was not united on questions of religion. The consensus among historians is that Nazism as a whole was either unrelated to Christianity or actively opposed to it.&lt;ref name="SG"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity|last=Steigmann-Gall|first=Richard|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-521-82371-4|location=Cambridge|pages=abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the term "[[positive Christianity]]" in the [[National Socialist Program|Nazi Party Program]] of the 1920s is generally regarded as a tactical measure, rooted in politics rather than religious conviction. Author Steigmann-Gall has put forward a minority interpretation, that positive Christianity had an "inner logic" and been "more than a political ploy".&lt;ref name="pp. 13–50"/&gt; He believes Hitler saw [[Jesus]] as an [[Aryan]] opponent of the Jews.&lt;ref name="Steigmann-Gall 2003 26–7"&gt;{{cite book|last=Steigmann-Gall|first=Richard|title=The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-82371-4|pages=26–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="steigmann26"/&gt; Though anti-Christians later fought to "expunge Christian influence from Nazism" and the movement became "increasingly hostile to the churches", Steigmann-Gall wrote that even in the end, it was not "uniformly anti-Christian".&lt;ref name="pp. 13–50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steigmann-Gall 2003 257–260"&gt;{{Harvnb|Steigmann-Gall|2003|pp=257–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Samuel Koehne, a Research Fellow at the [[Deakin University|Alfred Deakin Research Institute]], working on the official Nazi views on religion, answers the question ''Was Hitler a Christian?'' thus: "Emphatically not, if we consider Christianity in its traditional or orthodox form: Jesus as the son of God, dying for the redemption of the sins of all humankind. It is nonsense to state that Hitler (or any of the Nazis) adhered to Christianity of this form."&lt;ref name="Koehne"&gt;Koehne, Samuel, [http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/04/18/3480312.htm Hitler's faith: The debate over Nazism and religion], ABC Religion and Ethics, 18 Apr. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Nazi seizure of power=====
[[File:Hitler with Catholic dignitaries.jpg|thumb|Hitler shaking hands with Catholic dignitaries in Germany in the 1930s]]
Prior to the Reichstag vote for the [[Enabling Act]] of 1933, under which Hitler gained the "temporary" dictatorial powers with which he went on to permanently dismantle the [[Weimar Republic]], Hitler promised the German Parliament that he would not interfere with the rights of the churches. However, with power secured in Germany, Hitler quickly broke this promise.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; W. W. Norton &amp; Company; London; pp. 281–283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bullock; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; pp. 146–149&lt;/ref&gt;

Through 1933 and into 1934, the Nazi leader required a level of support from groups like the German conservatives and the [[Catholic Centre Party]] in the Reichstag, and of the conservative [[Paul von Hindenburg|President von Hindenberg]], in order to achieve his takeover of power with the "appearance of legality".&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bullock; ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991&lt;/ref&gt; In a proclamation on February 1, 1933, Hitler stated, "The National Government will regard it as its first and foremost duty to revive in the nation the spirit of unity and co-operation. It will preserve and defend those basic principles on which our nation has been built. It regards Christianity as the foundation of our national morality, and the family as the basis of national life."&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hitler. (1941). ''My New Order''. New York: Reynal &amp; Hitchcock, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March 1933, the Reichstag assembled in the [[Garrison Church (Potsdam)|Potsdam Garrison Church]], to show the "unity" of National Socialism with the old conservative Germany of President von Hindenburg. Two days later, the Nazis secured passage of the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], granting Hitler dictatorial powers. Less than three months later all non-Nazi parties and organizations, including the Catholic Centre Party had ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/267992/Adolf-Hitler/10116/Dictator-1933-39 Encyclopedia Britannica Online - ''Adolf Hitler''; web 20 Apr 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hitler sought to gain the votes of the [[Catholic Centre Party]] and German conservatives for the Enabling Act with a mix of intimidation, negotiation and conciliation.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bullock; ''Hitler: A Study in Tyranny''; Harper Perennial 1991; ch ''The Months of Opportunity''&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 March 1933, just prior to the vote for the [[Enabling Act]], he described the Christian faiths as "essential elements for safeguarding the soul of the German people" and "We hold the spiritual forces of Christianity to be indispensable elements in the moral uplift of most of the German people."&lt;ref name="William L. Shirer p. 234"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Barton. (2006). ''[http://www.churchinhistory.org/pages/booklets/rise(n)-1.htm Hitler's Rise to Power]''. www.churchinhistory.org.&lt;/ref&gt; "With an eye to the votes of the Catholic Centre Party", wrote Shirer, he added that he hoped to improve relations with the Holy See.&lt;ref name="William L. Shirer p. 234"/&gt; 

The Centre Party asked for guarantees of the rights of the churches. Hitler promised that the institutions of the [[Weimar Republic]] and churches would be protected, and said his government saw the churches as "the most important factors for upholding our nationhood". Amid threats and talk of civil war, the Centre Party voted for the Act.&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw 1998, p.467"&gt;Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler 1889–1936: Hubris''; Allen Lane/Penguin Press; 1998, p.467&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bullock, 1991, pp. 147-48"&gt;Bullock, 1991, pp. 147–148&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's false promises of protection for the churches and institutions of the republic were never kept.&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw 1998, p.467"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bullock, 1991, pp. 147-48"/&gt;

In January 1934, Hitler angered the churches by appointing the neo-pagan [[Alfred Rosenberg]] as official Nazi ideologist. The Fuhrer launched an effort toward [[Gleichschaltung|coordination]] of German Protestants under a unified [[Protestant Reich Church]] under the ''[[Deutsche Christen]]'' movement, but the attempt failed—resisted by the [[Confessing Church]]. In ''The Aryan Jesus: Christian Theologians and the Bible in Nazi Germany'', [[Susannah Heschel]] noted that the ''Deutsche Christens'' differed from traditional Christians by rejecting the Hebrew origins of Christianity. In public statements made during his rule, Hitler continued to speak positively about a Nazi vision of [[Christian]] German culture,&lt;ref name="Speeches"&gt;Baynes, Norman H., ed. (1969). ''The Speeches of Adolf Hitler: April 1922 – August 1939''. New York: Howard Fertig. pp. 19–20, 37, 240, 370, 371, 375, 378, 382, 383, 385–388, 390–392, 398–399, 402, 405–407, 410, 1018, 1544, 1594.&lt;/ref&gt; and his belief in an [[Aryan]] [[Christ]]. Hitler added that [[Saint Paul]], as a Jew, had falsified Jesus' message—a theme Hitler repeated in private conversations, including,  in October 1941, when he made the decision to murder the Jews.&lt;ref name="Susannah Heschel 2008. pp 1&amp;ndash;10"&gt;Susannah Heschel, ''The Aryan Jesus: Christian Theologians and the Bible in Nazi Germany'', Princeton University Press, 2008. pp. 1–10&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Kershaw said that Hitler had lost interest in supporting the ''[[Deutsche Christen]]'' from around 1934.&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw pp. 295–297"/&gt; However, in a speech 26 June 1934, Hitler stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The National Socialist State professes its allegiance to positive Christianity. It will be its honest endeavour to protect both the great Christian Confessions in their rights, to secure them from interference with their doctrines (''Lehren''), and in their duties to constitute a harmony with the views and the exigencies of the State of today.&lt;ref&gt;Baynes, Norman H. ed. (1969). ''The Speeches of Adolf Hitler: April 1922 – August 1939''. Vol. 1. New York: Howard Fertig. p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1937, [[Hans Kerrl]], Hitler's Minister for Church Affairs, explained "Positive Christianity" as not "dependent upon the [[Apostle's Creed]]", nor in "faith in Christ as the son of God", upon which Christianity relied, but rather, as being represented by the [[Nazi Party]]: "The Fuehrer is the herald of a new revelation", he said.&lt;ref name="William L. Shirer pp 238"&gt;William L. Shirer; ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich''; Secker &amp; Warburg; London; 1960; pp. 238–239&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[propaganda]] machinery of the Nazi party actively promoted Hitler as a saviour of Christianity,&lt;ref name="The 'Hitler Myth': Image and Reality in the Third Reich"&gt;{{cite book|title=The 'Hitler Myth': Image and Reality in the Third Reich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W4sUi6omc3cC&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=2013-04-22|year=1987|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280206-4|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nazi propaganda supported the ''[[German Christians]]'' in their formation of a single national church that could be controlled and manipulated.&lt;ref name="Kershaw2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Kershaw|title=Hitler, 1889–1936: Hubris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nV-N10gyoFwC&amp;pg=PA489|accessdate=2013-04-22|year=2000|publisher=W W Norton &amp; Company Incorporated|isbn=978-0-393-32035-0|pages=489–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baynes 1969 p. 402"/&gt;}}

====Hitler on mysticism and occultism====

{{Main article|Nazism and occultism}}

According to Bullock, as an adolescent in Vienna, Hitler read widely, including books on [[Occult]]ism, [[Hypnosis|Hypnotism]], [[Astrology]]. However, his interest in these subjects was fleeting, and there is no evidence that he ever subscribed to any of these schools of thought.&lt;ref name="Alan Bullock p11" /&gt; Bullock found "no evidence to support the once popular belief that Hitler resorted to astrology" and wrote that Hitler ridiculed those like Himmler in his own party who wanted to re-establish pagan mythology, and Hess who believed in Astrology.&lt;ref name="Stalin pp.412" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bullock; ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Speer wrote that Hitler had a negative view toward Himmler and Rosenberg's mystical notions. Speer quotes Hitler as having said of Himmler's attempt to mythologize the SS:&lt;ref name="p. 94"/&gt;

{{quotation|What nonsense! Here we have at last reached an age that has left all mysticism behind it, and now [Himmler] wants to start that all over again. We might just as well have stayed with the church. At least it had tradition. To think that I may, some day, be turned into an SS saint! Can you imagine it? I would turn over in my grave&amp;nbsp;...|Adolf Hitler quoted in [[Albert Speer]]'s ''[[Inside the Third Reich]]''}}

In a 1938 speech in Nuremberg Hitler rejected any form of mysticism, but expressed his belief in God, and that the Nazi's work was to fulfill a divine will:

{{Quotation|We will not allow mystically-minded occult folk with a passion for exploring the secrets of the world beyond to steal into our Movement. Such folk are not National Socialists, but something else&amp;nbsp;– in any case, something which has nothing to do with us. At the head of our program there stand no secret surmisings but clear-cut perception and straightforward profession of belief. But since we set as the central point of this perception and of this profession of belief the maintenance and hence the security for the future of a being formed by God, we thus serve the maintenance of a divine work and fulfill a divine will - not in the secret twilight of a new house of worship, but openly before the face of the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;Speech in Nuremberg on 6 September 1938. ''The Speeches of Adolf Hitler, April 1922 – August 1939, Volume 1'' Edited by Norman Hepburn Baynes. University of Michigan Press, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Ron Rosenbaum]], some scholars believe the young Hitler was strongly influenced, particularly in his racial views, by an abundance of occult works on the mystical superiority of the Germans, like the occult and anti-Semitic magazine ''[[Ostara (magazine)|Ostara]]'', and give credence to the claim of its publisher [[Lanz von Liebenfels]] that Hitler visited him in 1909 and praised his work.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, Ron ''Explaining Hitler'' pp. xxxvii, 282 (citing Yehuda Bauer's belief that Hitler's racism is rooted in occult groups like Ostara), p. 333, 1998 Random House&lt;/ref&gt; John Toland wrote that evidence indicates Hitler was a regular reader of ''Ostara''.&lt;ref&gt;Toland, John [Adolf Hitler] p. 45, 1976 Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Toland also included a poem that Hitler allegedly wrote while serving in the German Army on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Toland|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seminal work on [[Ariosophy]], ''[[The Occult Roots of Nazism]]'' by [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], devotes its last chapter the topic of ''Ariosophy and Adolf Hitler''. Not at least due to the difficulty of sources, historians disagree about the importance of Ariosophy for Hitler's religious views. As noted in the foreword of ''The Occult Roots of Nazism'' by [[Rohan Butler]], Goodrick-Clarke is more cautious in assessing the influence of Lanz von Liebenfels on Hitler than [[Joachim Fest]] in his biography of Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|1985|p=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing him to [[Erich Ludendorff]], Fest writes: "Hitler had detached himself from such affections, in which he encountered the obscurantism of his early years, Lanz v. Liebenfels and the [[Thule Society]], again, long ago and had, in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', formulated his scathing contempt for that [[völkish]] [[romanticism]], which however his own cosmos of imagination preserved rudimentarily."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--"Hitler selber hatte sich von solchen Neigungen, in denen er dem Obskurantismus seiner frühen Jahre, Lanz v. Liebenfels und den Wahnbildern der Thulegesellschaft wiederbegegente, längst gelößt und in &gt;&gt;Mein Kampf&lt;&lt; seine beißende Verachtung für jenen völkischen Romantizismus formuliert, den seine eigene Vorstellungswelt gleichwohl rudimentär bewahrte."--&gt;{{Harvnb|Fest|1973|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fest refers to the following passage from ''Mein Kampf'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;"The characteristic thing about these people [modern-day followers of the early Germanic religion] is that they rave about the old Germanic heroism, about dim prehistory, stone axes, spear and shield, but in reality are the greatest cowards that can be imagined. For the same people who brandish scholarly imitations of old German tin swords, and wear a dressed bearskin with bull's horns over their heads, preach for the present nothing but struggle with spiritual weapons, and run away as fast as they can from every [[Communist]] blackjack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hitler|1926|loc=ch. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is not clear if this statement is an attack at anyone specific. It could have been aimed at [[Karl Harrer]] or at the [[Strasserism|Strasser group]]. According to Goodrick-Clarke, "In any case, the outburst clearly implies Hitler's contempt for conspiratorial circles and occult-racist studies and his preference for direct activism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|1985|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler also said something similar in public speeches.&lt;ref&gt;"We will not allow mystically-minded occult folk with a passion for exploring the secrets of the world beyond to steal into our Movement. Such folk are not National Socialists, but something else—in any case something which has nothing to do with us." (Speech in Nuremberg on 6 September 1938)&lt;/ref&gt;

Older literature states that Hitler had no intention of instituting worship of the [[Germanic paganism|ancient Germanic gods]] in contrast to the beliefs of some other Nazi officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gunther|1938|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Hitler's Table Talk]]'' one can find this quote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;"It seems to me that nothing would be more foolish than to re-establish the worship of [[Wodan|Wotan]]. Our old mythology ceased to be viable when Christianity implanted itself. Nothing dies unless it is moribund.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jackson Spielvogel]] and David Redles in an article published by the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] assert alleged influences of various portions of the teachings of [[H.P. Blavatsky]], the founder of The Theosophical Society with doctrines as expounded by her book "The Secret Doctrine", and the adaptations of her ideas by her followers, through Ariosophy, the [[Germanenorden]] and the Thule Society, constituted a popularly unacknowledged but decisive influence over the developing mind of Hitler.&lt;ref name="motlc.wiesenthal.com"&gt;Jackson Spielvogel and David Redles: [http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=gvKVLcMVIuG&amp;b=395043 ''Hitler's Racial Ideology: Content and Occult Sources''], The Simon Wiesenthal Center, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The scholars state that Hitler himself may be responsible for turning historians from investigating his occult influences.&lt;ref name="motlc.wiesenthal.com" /&gt; While he publicly condemned and even persecuted occultists, Freemasons, and astrologers, his nightly private talks disclosed his belief in the ideas of these competing occult groups—demonstrated by his discussion of [[reincarnation]], [[Atlantis]], [[Welteislehre|world ice theory]], and his belief that esoteric myths and legends of cataclysm and battles between gods and titans were a vague collective memory of monumental early events.&lt;ref name="motlc.wiesenthal.com" /&gt;

In his childhood, Hitler had admired the pomp of Catholic ritual and the hierarchical organization of the clergy. Later he drew on these elements, organizing his party along hierarchical lines and including [[Liturgy|liturgical]] forms into events or using phraseology taken from hymns.&lt;ref&gt;Rissmann, Michael (2001). ''Hitlers Gott''. Zurich, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these liturgical elements, Daim's claim of Hitler's Messiah-like status and the ideology's totalitarian nature, the Nazi movement, like other [[fascist]] movements and [[Communism]], is sometimes termed a "[[political religion]]" that is anti-ecclesiastical and anti-religious.&lt;ref&gt;Voegelin, Eric (1986). ''Political Religions''. New York: Edward Mellen Press. {{ISBN|978-0-88946-767-5}}.

Although Hitler expressed negative views towards the mystical notions of some of his senior Nazi underlings in private, he nevertheless appointed [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Alfred Rosenberg]] to senior positions in the Nazi movement.&lt;ref name="p. 94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; [[William Shirer]] wrote that, "under the leadership of Rosenberg, Bormann and Himmler—backed by Hitler—the Nazi regime intended to destroy Christianity in Germany, if it could, and substitute the old paganism of the early tribal Germanic gods with the new paganism of the Nazi extremists".&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Blainey wrote: "Nazism itself was a religion, a pagan religion, and Hitler was its high priest&amp;nbsp;... Its high altar [was] Germany itself and the German people, their soil and forests and language and traditions".&lt;ref name="Christianity pp. 495&amp;ndash;6"/&gt;

In 1924,  during his imprisonment, Hitler had chosen [[Alfred Rosenberg]] to lead the Nazi movement in his absence.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Rees; ''The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler''; Ebury Press 2012; p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; In his seminal 1930 work ''[[The Myth of the 20th Century]]'', Rosenberg wrote: "We now realize that the central supreme values of the Roman and the Protestant Churches [-] hinder the organic powers of the peoples determined by their Nordic race, [-] they will have to be remodeled". Hitler had called his book "derivative, pastiche, illogical rubbish!"&lt;ref&gt;The Face of the Third Reich, Joachim Fest, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; But in January 1934, Hitler appointed Rosenberg as the cultural and educational leader of the Reich - the official Nazi philosopher and ideologist. Rosenberg was notoriously anti-Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bonney; ''Confronting the Nazi War on Christianity: the Kulturkampf Newsletters, 1936–1939''; International Academic Publishers; Bern; 2009 {{ISBN|978-3-03911-904-2}}; pp. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Church officials were perturbed by Hitler's appointment of Rosenberg as Nazi philosopher as it apparently endorsed Rosenberg's anti-church and neo-pagan philosophy. The Vatican banned  ''Myth of the Twentieth Century'' in February, 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, 1994, see Chronology&lt;/ref&gt; During the War, Rosenberg outlined the future he envisioned for religion in Germany. Among its articles: the National Reich Church of Germany was to claim exclusive control over all churches; publication of the Bible was to cease; crucifixes, Bibles and saints were to be removed from altars; and Mein Kampf was to be placed on altars as "to the German nation and therefore to God the most sacred book"; and the Christian Cross was to be removed from all churches and replaced with the swastika. But Rosenberg was in the end, a marginalised figure in the Hitler regime.&lt;ref&gt;The Face of the Third Reich, Joachim Fest, pp. 247–264&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Hitler selected [[Heinrich Himmler]] to head the Nazi ''[[Schutzstaffel]]''  (SS) security forces. Himmler saw the main task of the SS to be that of "acting as the vanguard in overcoming Christianity and restoring a 'Germanic' way of living" in order to prepare for the coming conflict between "humans and subhumans":&lt;ref name="Peter Longerich p.265"&gt;Peter Longerich; ''Heinrich Himmler''; Translated by Jeremy Noakes and Lesley Sharpe; Oxford University Press; 2012; p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; He set about making his SS the focus of a "cult of the Teutons".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Longerich; ''Heinrich Himmler''; Translated by Jeremy Noakes and Lesley Sharpe; Oxford University Press; 2012; p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 he wrote that it was "the mission of the SS to give the German people in the next half century the non-Christian ideological foundations on which to lead and shape their lives. This task does not consist solely in overcoming an ideological opponent but must be accompanied at every step by a positive impetus: in this case that means the reconstruction of the German heritage in the widest and most comprehensive sense."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Longerich; ''Heinrich Himmler''; Translated by Jeremy Noakes and Lesley Sharpe; Oxford University Press; 2012; p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hitler on atheism====
{{Further information|Discrimination against atheists in Nazi Germany}}

During his career, and for a variety of reasons, Hitler made various comments [[Discrimination against atheists in Nazi Germany|against "atheistic" movements]]. He associated [[atheism]] with [[Bolshevik|Bolshevism]], [[Communism]], and "Jewish materialism".&lt;ref name="The Speeches of Adolf Hitler"&gt;Norman H. Baynes, ed., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PxZoAAAAMAAJ The Speeches of Adolf Hitler, April 1922 – August 1939]''. Vol. 1. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1942, pp. 240, 378, 386.&lt;/ref&gt; Overy writes of Hitler as skeptical of all religious belief, though not a thorough atheist:&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy; ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004. pp 281&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|"Hitler was politically prudent enough not to trumpet his scientific views publicly, not least because he wanted to maintain the distinction between his own movement and the godlessness of Soviet Communism. Nor was he a thorough atheist. His public utterances are peppered with references to 'God' and 'Spirit'. For Hitler the eschatological truths that he found in his perception of the race represented the real 'eternal will that rules the universe'; in the infinite value of the race and the struggle to sustain it men find what they might call God, an inner sense of the unity and purposiveness of nature and history&amp;nbsp;... What Hitler could not accept was that Christianity could offer anything other than false 'ideas' to sustain its claim to moral certitude."|Excerpt from ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'' by [[Richard Overy]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Overy|Overy, Richard]] (2004) ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin. p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] wrote that Hitler courted and benefited from fear among German Christians of militant Communist atheism.&lt;ref name="Christianity pp. 495&amp;ndash;6"/&gt; "The aggressive spread of atheism in the Soviet Union alarmed many German Christians", wrote Blainey, and with the National Socialists becoming the main opponent of Communism in Germany: "[Hitler] himself saw Christianity as a temporary ally, for in his opinion 'one is either a Christian or a German'. To be both was impossible."&lt;ref name="Christianity pp. 495&amp;ndash;6"/&gt; In early 1933, Hitler publicly defended National Socialism against charges that it was anti-Christian. Responding to accusations by [[Eugen Bolz]], the Catholic Centre Party [[List of Ministers-President of Baden-Württemberg|Staatspräsident]] of [[Württemberg]], that the National Socialist movement threatened the Christian faith, he said:

{{quotation|And now Staatspräsident [[Eugen Bolz|Bolz]] says that Christianity and the Catholic faith are threatened by us. And to that charge I can answer: In the first place it is Christians and not international atheists who now stand at the head of Germany. I do not merely talk of Christianity, no, I also profess that I will never ally myself with the parties which destroy Christianity. If many wish today to take threatened Christianity under their protection, where, I would ask, was Christianity for them in these fourteen years when they went arm in arm with atheism? No, never and at no time was greater internal damage done to Christianity than in these fourteen years when a [[Catholic Centre Party|party]], theoretically Christian, sat with those who denied God in one and the same Government.|[[Adolf Hitler]], ''Speech delivered at Stuttgart, 15 February 1933" &lt;ref name="Norman H. Baynes 1969 p. 240"&gt;from Norman H. Baynes, ed. (1969). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PxZoAAAAMAAJ The Speeches of Adolf Hitler: April 1922 – August 1939]''. 1. New York: Howard Fertig. p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hitler's speech referred to the political alliances of the Catholic aligned Centre Party with parties of the Left, which he associated with Bolshevism, and thus, atheism. Eugen Bolz was forced from office soon after the Nazis took power, and imprisoned for a time. Later he was executed by the Nazi regime.

During negotiations leading to the [[Reichskonkordat]] with the Vatican, Hitler said, "Secular schools can never be tolerated because such schools have no religious instruction, and a general moral instruction without a religious foundation is built on air; consequently, all character training and religion must be derived from faith."&lt;ref name="The German Churches Under Hitler"&gt;Ernst Helmreich, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=I6DYAAAAMAAJ The German Churches Under Hitler]''. Detroit: Wayne State Univ. Press, 1979, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Hitler consolidated his power, schools became a major battleground in the Nazi [[kirchenkampf|campaign against the churches]]. In 1937, the Nazis banned any member of the [[Hitler Youth]] from simultaneously belonging to a religious youth movement. Religious education was not permitted in the Hitler Youth and by 1939, clergymen teachers had been removed from virtually all state schools.&lt;ref name="The Third Reich p.157"&gt;[[Richard Overy]]; ''The Third Reich, A Chronicle''; Quercus; 2010; p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler sometimes allowed pressure to be placed on German parents to remove children from religious classes to be given ideological instruction in its place, while in elite Nazi schools, Christian prayers were replaced with Teutonic rituals and sun-worship.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/202210/fascism/219389/Identification-with-Christianity Encyclopedia Online – ''Fascism – Identification with Christianity''] web 20 Apr 2013&lt;/ref&gt; By 1939 all Catholic denominational schools had been disbanded or converted to public facilities.&lt;ref name="Evans, Richard J. 2005 pp. 245"&gt;Evans, Richard J. (2005). ''The Third Reich in Power''. New York: Penguin. {{ISBN|978-0-14-303790-3}}; pp. 245–246&lt;/ref&gt;

In a radio address October 14, 1933 Hitler stated, "For eight months we have been waging a heroic battle against the Communist threat to our Volk, the decomposition of our culture, the subversion of our art, and the poisoning of our public morality. We have put an end to denial of God and abuse of religion. We owe Providence humble gratitude for not allowing us to lose our battle against the misery of unemployment and for the salvation of the German peasant."&lt;ref name="Norman H. Baynes 1939. pp. 369–370"&gt;Norman H. Baynes, ed., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PxZoAAAAMAAJ The Speeches of Adolf Hitler, April 1922 – August 1939]''. Vol. 1. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1942, pp. 369–370.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech delivered in Berlin, October 24, 1933, Hitler stated: "We were convinced that the people needs and requires this faith. We have therefore undertaken the fight against the [[Communist Party of Germany|atheistic movement]], and that not merely with a few theoretical declarations: we have stamped it out."&lt;ref name="Norman H. Baynes 1939. p. 378"&gt;Norman H. Baynes, ed., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PxZoAAAAMAAJ The Speeches of Adolf Hitler]'', April 1922-August 1939. Vol. 1. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1942, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech delivered at [[Koblenz]], August 26, 1934 Hitler said: "There may have been a time when even parties founded on the ecclesiastical basis were a necessity. At that time [[Liberalism]] was opposed to the Church, while [[Marxism]] was anti-religious. But that time is past. National Socialism neither opposes the Church nor is it anti-religious, but on the contrary, it stands on the ground of a real Christianity. The Church's interests cannot fail to coincide with ours alike in our fight against the symptoms of degeneracy in the world of today, in our fight against the Bolshevist culture, against an atheistic movement, against criminality, and in our struggle for the consciousness of a community in our national life, for the conquest of hatred and disunion between the classes, for the conquest of civil war and unrest, of strife and discord. These are not anti-Christian, these are Christian principles."&lt;ref name="Norman H. Baynes 1939. p. 386"&gt;Norman H. Baynes, ed., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PxZoAAAAMAAJ The Speeches of Adolf Hitler, April 1922 – August 1939]''. Vol. 1. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1942, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hitler on Ancient Indian religions====

Hitler's choice of the [[Swastika]] as the Nazis' main and official symbol was linked to the belief in the [[Aryan]] cultural descent of the German people. They considered the early [[Aryan]]s to be the prototypical white invaders and the sign of the Swastika to be a symbol of the Aryan [[master race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4183467.stm|title=Origins of the swastika|date=2005-01-18|accessdate=2008-04-28|work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was inspired by the German archaeologist [[Gustaf Kossinna]],&lt;ref name="opqa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/indusrivercivilizations/a/aryans.htm|title=Who Were the Aryans?|author=K. Kris Hirst|date=|work=About.com Education|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that the ancient Aryans were a superior [[Nordic race]] from northern Germany who expanded into the steppes of Eurasia, and from there into India, where they established the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]].&lt;ref name="opqa"/&gt;

====Hitler on Islam====
{{see also|Relations between Nazi Germany and the Arab world}}

Hitler's views on Islam are a matter of controversy. On the one hand, Hitler privately demeaned ethnic groups he associated with Islam, notably Arabs, as racially inferior. On the other hand, he also made private and public statements expressing admiration for what he perceived to be the militaristic nature of Islam and the political sharpness of the [[Prophet Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/fall-2014-the-great-wars/the-swastika-and-the-crescent/|title=The Swastika and the Crescent|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1987-004-09A, Amin al Husseini und Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|right|Hitler meeting [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]], the then [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]. December 1941]]

Among eastern religions, Hitler described religious leaders such as "[[Confucius]], [[Buddha]], and [[Muhammad]]" as providers of "spiritual sustenance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Angebert|1974|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, Hitler's connection to [[Mohammad Amin al-Husseini]], who served as the [[Mufti]] of [[Jerusalem]] until 1937&amp;nbsp;– which included his asylum in 1941, with the honorary rank of an [[SS]] Major-General, and recognition as an "[[honorary Aryan]],"&amp;nbsp;–
has been interpreted by some as a sign of respect, while others characterize it as a relationship born out of political expediency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Angebert|1974|pp=275–276}} note 14&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1933, al-Husseini, who had launched a campaign to free various parts of the Arab region from British control and expel Jews from both Egypt and Palestine, became impressed by the Jewish boycott policies which the Nazis were enforcing in Germany, and hoped that he could use the anti-semitic views which many in the Arab region shared with Hitler's regime in order to forge a strategic military alliance that would help him eliminate the Jews from Palestine.&lt;ref name=klausmuslim&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus Gensicke|title=Der Mufti von Jerusalem Amin el-Husseini, und die Nationalsozialisten|location=Frankfurt/M. |year=1988|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite al-Husseini's attempts to reach out to Germany, Hitler refused to form such an alliance with al-Husseini, fearing that it would weaken relations with Britain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007666|title=Hajj Amin al-Husayni: Arab Nationalist and Muslim Leader|author=Holocaust Encyclopedia|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name=klausmuslim /&gt;

During the unsuccessful [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]], Husseini and his allies took the opportunity to strengthen relations with Germany and enforced the spread of Nazi customs and propaganda throughout their strongholds in Palestine as a gesture of respect.&lt;ref name=paulmuslim&gt;{{cite book|author=Ralf Paul Gerhard Balke|title=Die Landesgruppe der NSDAP in Palästina |location=Düsseldorf|year=1997|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt, the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] would follow al-Husseini's lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gudrun Krämer|title= Minderheit, Millet, Nation? Die Juden in Ägypten 1914–1952|location=Wiesbaden|year=1982|page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's influence soon spread throughout the region, but it was not until 1937 that the Nazi government agreed to grant al-Husseini and the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]'s request for financial and military assistance.&lt;ref name=klausmuslim /&gt;

According to Speer, Hitler wished that the Ottoman Empire had conquered Vienna in 1683: "The Mohammedan religion would have been much more compatible to us than Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness and flabbiness?"&lt;ref name="Speer1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Albert Speer|title=Inside the Third Reich: memoirs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XLSa_RIDHMUC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=2010-09-15|date=1 April 1997|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-82949-4|pages=96–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Hitler was transcribed as saying: "Had [[Charles Martel]] not been victorious at Poitiers&amp;nbsp;... then we should in all probability have been converted to Mohammedanism, that cult which glorifies the heroism and which opens up the seventh Heaven to the bold warrior alone. Then the Germanic races would have conquered the world."{{sfn|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|p=667}}

Notwithstanding Hitler's apparent admiration for Islam and Muhammad, and his willingness to work with Arab political leaders, he saw individual Muslims as racial and social inferiors. Nazi-era Minister of Armaments and War Production [[Albert Speer]] acknowledged that in private, Hitler regarded Arabs as an inferior race&lt;ref name="Speer1997" /&gt; and that the relationship he had with various Muslim figures was more political than personal.&lt;ref name="Speer1997" /&gt; During a meeting with a delegation of distinguished Arab figures, Hitler learned of how Islam motivated the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] during the [[Islamic invasion of Gaul|Islamic conquest of Gaul]] and was now convinced that "the world would be Mohammedan today" if the Arab regime had successfully taken France during the [[Battle of Tours]],&lt;ref name="Speer1997" /&gt; while also suggesting to Speer that "ultimately not Arabs, but Islamized Germans could have stood at the head of this Mohammedan Empire."&lt;ref name="Speer1997" /&gt; Hitler said that the Germans would have become heirs to "a religion that believed in spreading the faith by the sword and in subjugating all nations to that faith. Such a creed was perfectly suited to the German temperament."&lt;ref&gt;"Speer, 1970", pp. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted, Hitler was profoundly racist against the ethnic groups that practiced Islam. Regarding Hitler's wish that the Ottomans had conquered Europe, Speer notes that Hitler believed that their hegemony over Germans could not last, because of their racial inferiority, but that Islamized Germans would come to rule the world in their place.&lt;ref name="Speer1997"/&gt;  Hitler was also quoted in the early war years stating, "We shall continue to make disturbances in the [[Far East]] and in [[Arabia]].  Let us think as men and let us see in these peoples at best lacquered half-apes who are anxious to experience the lash."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stefan Wild | title = National Socialism in the Arab near East between 1933 and 1939 | journal = Die Welt des Islams, New Series | volume = 25 | year = 1985 | pages = 126–173 | quote = Wir werden weiterhin die Unruhe in Fernost und in Arabien schüren.

Wistrich|Wistrich, Robert S.]] (1985) ''Hitler's Apocalypse: Jews and the Nazi Legacy''. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. p. 59 {{isbn|0297787195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hitler on Judaism====

National Socialist ideology developed a racial hierarchy which placed minority groups&amp;nbsp;– most especially the Jews&amp;nbsp;– as subhuman. The categorization was based on the Nazi conception of race, and not on religion, thus Slavs and Poles (who were overwhelmingly Christian) were also grouped as inferior to the so-called "Aryan" peoples. Hitler espoused a ruthless policy of "negative eugenic selection", believing that world history consisted of a struggle for survival between races, in which the Jews plotted to undermine the Germans, and inferior groups like Slavs and defective individuals in the German gene pool, threatened the Aryan "master race".&lt;ref name="Richard J pp. 55–57"&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]]; ''In Search of German Social Darwinism: The History and Historiography of a Concept''; a chapter from ''Medicine &amp; Modernity: Public Health &amp; Medical Care in 19th and 20th Century Germany''; Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge; 1997; pp. 55–57&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hitler also had ideological objections to Judaism as a faith, and some of Hitler's antipathy towards Christianity flowed from its Jewish origins, as he saw Christianity as "indelibly Jewish in origin and character" and a "prototype of Bolshevism", which "violated the law of natural selection".&lt;ref name="Richard J 2009, p. 547"&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]]; ''The Third Reich at War''; Penguin Press; New York 2009, p. 547&lt;/ref&gt; 

Writing for the public in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler described the Jews as enemies of all civilization and as materialistic, unspiritual beings: "His life is only of this world, and his spirit is inwardly as alien to true Christianity as his nature two thousand years previous was to the great founder of the new doctrine."&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Adolf Hitler, ''Mein Kampf'', Ralph Mannheim, ed., New York: Mariner Books, 1999, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In the work, he also described a supposedly divine mandate for his anti-Semitism: "Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord."&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

During negotiations for the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] between the Catholic Church and Germany in 1933, Hitler said to Bishop Wilhelm Berning: "I have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in [[ghetto]]s, etc, because it recognised the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognised. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognise the representatives of this race as pestilant for the state and for the church and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions".&lt;ref&gt;Nazi Germany &amp; the Jews: The Years of Persecution 1933–39, [[Saul Friedländer]], p. 47, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-297-81882-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Secular versus religious influences====

Scholarly interest continues on the extent to which inherited, long-standing, cultural-religious notions of anti-Judaism in Christian Europe contributed to Hitler's personal racial anti-Semitism, and what influence a pseudo-scientific "primitive version of social-Darwinism", mixed with 19th century imperialist notions, brought to bear on his psychology. While Hitler's views on these subjects have often been called "[[social Darwinist]]", Hitler's grasp of the subject has been argued to have been incomplete,&lt;ref&gt;Zalampas, Sherree Owens. (1990). ''Adolf Hitler: A psychological interpretation of his views on architecture, art, and music''. Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green University Popular Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=t-tQ9V2--1kC&amp;pg=PA139 p. 139.].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Ellenberger|Ellenberger, Henri]] (1970). ''[[The Discovery of the Unconscious|The Discovery of the Unconscious: The history and evolution of dynamic psychiatry]]''. New York: Basic Books. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ke1jd_e7AyYC&amp;pg=PA235 p. 235.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sklair, Leslie (2003). ''The Sociology of Progress''. New York: Routledge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TMQ9a8H7QkEC&amp;pg=PA71 p. 71.] {{ISBN|978-0-415-17545-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Dietrich Bracher, The German Dictatorship, pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;  there is little agreement among historians as to what the term may mean, or how it transformed from its 19th-century scientific origins, to become a central component of a genocidal political ideology in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Richard J pp. 55–57"/&gt;

According to historian [[Lucy Dawidowicz]], anti-Semitism has a long history within Christianity, and the line of "anti-Semitic descent" from Luther to Hitler is "easy to draw". In her ''[[The War Against the Jews]], 1933–1945'', she writes that Luther and Hitler were obsessed by the "[[demonology|demonologized]] universe" inhabited by Jews. Dawidowicz states that the similarities between Luther's anti-Semitic writings and modern anti-Semitism are no coincidence, because they derived from a common history of ''Judenhass'' which can be traced to [[Haman (Bible)|Haman's]] advice to [[Ahasuerus]], although modern German anti-Semitism also has its roots in German [[nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;''The War Against the Jews, 1933–1945''. First published 1975; this Bantam edition 1986, p. 23. {{ISBN|978-0-553-34532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic historian [[José M. Sánchez]] argues that Hitler's anti-Semitism was explicitly rooted in Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;José M. Sánchez, ''Pius XII and the Holocaust; Understanding the Controversy'' (Washington, D.C: Catholic University of American Press, 2002), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers including [[Susannah Heschel|Heschel]] and [[John Toland (author)|Toland]], have drawn links between Hitler's Catholic background and his anti-Semitism.&lt;ref name="John Toland 1976 p. 703"&gt;John Toland. (1976). ''Adolf Hitler: The Definitive Biography''. New York: Anchor Books, p. 703.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laurence Rees]] in contrast, notes that there is little emphasis on Christianity in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', which presents a view of the universe conspicuously at odds with traditional Christians notions long established in Germany. Hitler's vision is ordered instead around principles of struggle between weak and strong.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Rees argues that Hitler's "bleak and violent vision" and visceral hatred of the Jews had been influenced by sources outside the Christian tradition. The notion of life as struggle Hitler drew from [[Social Darwinism]], the notion of the superiority of the "Aryan race" he drew from [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''The Inequality of the Human Races''; from events following Russia's surrender in World War One when Germany seized agricultural lands in the East he formed the idea of colonising the Soviet Union; and from [[Alfred Rosenberg]] he took the idea of a link between Judaism and Bolshevism, writes Rees.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Rees; ''The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler''; Ebury Press 2012; pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Richard J. Evans]] notes that Hitler "used his own version of the language of social Darwinism as a central element in the discursive practice of extermination...", and the language of Social Darwinism, in its Nazi variant, helped to remove all restraint from the directors of the "terroristic and exterminatory" policies of the regime, by "persuading them that what they were doing was justified by history, science and nature".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]]; ''In Search of German Social Darwinism: The History and Historiography of a Concept'', 1997 – (quoted by [[Richard Weikart]] in ''Hitler's Religion: The Twisted Beliefs that Drove the Third Reich''; Regnery; USA 2016; {{ISBN|978-1621575009}}; p. 352)&lt;/ref&gt; Fest considers that Hitler simplified de Gobineau's elaborate ideas of [[Survival of the fittest|struggle for survival]] among the different races, from which the Aryan race, guided by providence, was supposed to be the torchbearers of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Fest, Joachim (1974). ''Hitler''. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qnnlUEDZZIAC&amp;pg=PA56 56,] [https://books.google.com/books?id=qnnlUEDZZIAC&amp;pg=PA210 210.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his rhetoric{{when|date=April 2017}} Hitler fed on the old accusation of Jewish [[deicide]]. It has been speculated that Christian anti-Judaism influenced Hitler's ideas, especially such works as [[Martin Luther]]'s essay ''[[On the Jews and Their Lies]]'' and the writings of [[Paul de Lagarde]].{{CN|date=April 2017}} Others disagree with this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirer|1960|pp=91–236}} &lt;!-- Was cited earlier as the 1990 edition, if the information exists in the 1960 edition correct the pages, if not put the 1990 edition in references and correct the other reference --&gt; argues that Luther's essay was influential. This view was expounded by [[Lucy Dawidowicz]]. ({{Harvnb|Dawidowicz|1986|p=23}}) Uwe Siemon-Netto disputes this conclusion ({{Harvnb|Siemon-Netto|1995|pp=17–20}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler biographer [[John Toland (author)|John Toland]] offers the opinion that Hitler "carried within him its teaching that the Jew was the killer of God. The extermination, therefore, could be done without a twinge of [[conscience]] since he was merely acting as the avenging hand of God&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="John Toland 1976 p. 703"/&gt; Toland wrote that in 1941 Hitler was still "a member in good standing of the Church of Rome despite his detestation of its hierarchy" and "he carried within himself its teaching that the [[Jewish deicide|Jew was the killer of God]]. The extermination, therefore, could be done without a twinge of [[conscience]] since he was merely acting as the avenging hand of God—so long as it was done impersonally, without cruelty."&lt;ref&gt;John Toland.

==Hitler's policies towards religion==
{{Main article|Religion in Nazi Germany|}}

===Role of religion in the Nazi state===
[[Nazi ideology]] could not accept an autonomous establishment whose legitimacy did not spring from the government. It desired the subordination of church to state.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; {{ISBN|0-674-63680-5}}; p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Nazi Germany was not formally atheist, and, other than for Jews and Jehovah's Witnesses, religious observance was permitted.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Richard Overy; ''The Dictators Hitler's Germany Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004.p278&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julian Baggini]] wrote that Hitler's Germany was not a "straightforwardly atheist state", but one which "sacrilized" notions of blood and nation.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;[[Julian Baggini]]; ''Atheism a Very Short Introduction''; Oxford University Press, 2003, pp. 85–87&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hitler feared the results of overt attacks on the deep-rooted German churches, as around two thirds of Germans were Protestant and most of the rest were Roman Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy; ''The Dictators Hitler's Germany Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004. pp. 278–285&lt;/ref&gt; German conservative elements, such as the officer corps of the army, opposed Nazi efforts against the churches, and Hitler needed to show caution.&lt;ref name="Hitler p218"&gt;[[Alan Bullock]]; ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]''; Harper Perennial Edition 1991; p. 218"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Bullock]]; ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]''; Harper Perennial Edition 1991; p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Miner|2003|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomsett|1997|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christianity pp. 495&amp;ndash;6"&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; pp. 495–496&lt;/ref&gt; The Hitler regime responded to the ideological challenge of Christian morality using political repression and persecution and by challenging Christian teachings through education and propaganda.&lt;ref name="Richard Overy 2004. p.285"/&gt; 

====''Kirchenkampf'' Church Struggle====
{{See also|Kirchenkampf|Catholic Church and Nazi Germany|Confessing Church|Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R24391, Konkordatsunterzeichnung in Rom.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Vice-Chancellor Papen in Rome signs the [[Reich concordat]]. Hitler moved early to contain the churches, from whom he perceived a threat.]]

Hitler possessed radical instincts in relation to the Nazi conflict with the Churches, and though he occasionally spoke of wanting to delay a struggle and was prepared to restrain his anti-clericalism out of political considerations, Kershaw considers that his "own inflammatory comments gave his immediate underlings all the license they needed to turn up the heat in the 'Church Struggle{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw pp. 381&amp;ndash;382"/&gt;

Hitler "wanted to neutralise any political threat from organised religion", wrote Overy. "The first step was to reach agreement with the Roman Catholic Church, whose theology was not susceptible to the new nationalist trends&amp;nbsp;..." Hitler dispatched the Catholic conservative [[Franz von Papen]] to negotiate a [[Reich concordat|Concordat]] with the Vatican. He obtained an agreement that clergy would refrain from politics, in return for guarantees of Church rights.&lt;ref name="Richard Overy 2004. p 283-5"&gt;Richard Overy; ''The Dictators Hitler's Germany Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004. pp. 283–285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw p.290"/&gt; Hitler was delighted, and received the congratulations of German Catholic leaders.&lt;ref&gt;an Kershaw; ''Hitler 1889–1936 Hubris''; Allen Lane/Penguin Press; 1998, p.467&lt;/ref&gt; However, violations of the treaty began almost as soon as it was signed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; [[A Short History of Christianity]]; pp. 495–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; W. W. Norton &amp; Company; London; p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler promulgated the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring|sterilization law]], and began work to dissolve the Catholic Youth League. Clergy, nuns and lay leaders began to be targeted, leading to thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or "immorality".&lt;ref name="William L. Shirer p234-5"&gt;William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker &amp; Warburg; London; 1960; pp 234-235&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic publications were shut down. The [[Gestapo]] began to violate the sanctity of the confessional.&lt;ref name="William L. Shirer p. 234"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw pp. 381&amp;ndash;382"/&gt;

By early 1937, the church hierarchy in Germany, which had initially attempted to co-operate with Hitler, had become highly disillusioned and [[Pope Pius XI]] issued the ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' encyclical—accusing Germany of violations of the Concordat and of sowing the tares of "open fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church", and denounced the pagan myth of "blood and soil".&lt;ref name="William L. Shirer p. 234"/&gt; Hitler's invasion of the predominantly Catholic Poland in 1939 ignited the [[Second World War]]. Kerhsaw wrote that, in Hitler's scheme for the Germanization of the East, "There would, he made clear, be no place in this utopia for the Christian Churches".&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw p.661"/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14899, Jüterbog, Referendarlager.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hitler appointed [[Hanns Kerrl]] as Minister for Church Affairs in 1935. Kerrl rejected Christ as the basis of Christianity.&lt;ref name="William L. Shirer pp 238"/&gt;]]

On Protestantism, Hitler proposed to unite Germany's 28 Protestant churches into one [[German Evangelical Church|Reich Church]]. Steigmann-Gall wrote that Hitler demonstrated a preference for [[Protestantism]] over Catholicism, as Protestantism was more liable to reinterpretation and a non-traditional readings, more receptive to "[[positive Christianity]]", and because some of its liberal branches had held similar views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steigmann-Gall|2003|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a778861374&amp;fulltext=713240928|title=The Nazis' 'Positive Christianity': a Variety of 'Clerical Fascism'?|author=Steigmann-Gall, Richard|work=[[Kent State University]]|date=2007-06-01|accessdate=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's interest was opportunistic: "From Hitler's point of view, a national church was of interest purely from a point of view of control and manipulation", wrote Kershaw.&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw 1998, p.489-90"&gt;Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler 1889–1936: Hubris''; Allen Lane/Penguin Press; 1998, pp. 489–490&lt;/ref&gt; He installed his friend [[Ludwig Müller]] as leader of the movement and sought to establish a pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic unified Reich Church.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Shirer; ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich''; Secker &amp; Warburg; London; 1960; pp. 234–238.&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance quickly arose in the form of the [[Pastors' Emergency League]], led by [[Martin Neimoller]],  which had 40% of clergy by 1934 and founded the [[Confessing Church]], from which some clergymen opposed the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Scott Latourette, ''Christianity in a Revolutionary Age'' vol. IV ''The Twentieth Century in Europe'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1961), p. 259 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''German Christians'' called for rejection of the Bible as "Jewish superstition" and of the Christian calling to "love thy neighbour", the movement lost still further support. Hitler's move to have Müller elected Bishop failed&amp;nbsp;– despite intimidation. He then abandoned his efforts to unite the Protestant churches, appointed [[Hans Kerrl]] as Minister for Church Affairs in December 1934, and distanced himself permanently from the so-called "German Christians".&lt;ref name="Richard Overy 2004. p 283-5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poewe, Karla (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=rsR_Mrh2QSkC&amp;dq ''New Religions and the Nazis''.] Routledge, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Steigmann-Gall, he regretted that "the churches had failed to back him and his movement as he had hoped".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steigmann-Gall|2003|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler stated to Albert Speer, "Through me the Protestant Church could become the established church, as in [[Church of England|England]]."&lt;ref&gt;Speer, Albert (1970). ''Inside the Third Reich''. New York: [https://books.google.com/books?id=XLSa_RIDHMUC&amp;pg=PA95 p. 95.]&lt;/ref&gt; A relative moderate, Kerrl initially had some success but amid continuing protests by the Confessing Church against Nazi policies, he accused dissident churchmen of failing to appreciate the Nazi doctrine of "Race, blood and soil". Kerrl said Nazi Positive Christianity rejected the [[Apostle's Creed]] and Divinity of Christ as the basis of Christianity, and called Hitler the herald of a new revelation.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Shirer; ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich''; Secker &amp; Warburg; London; 1960; pp. 238–239&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler had Neimoller sent to the Concentration Camps in 1938, where he remained until war's end.&lt;ref name="Richard Overy 2004. p.286"&gt;Richard Overy; ''The Dictators Hitler's Germany Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004. p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler largely ignored Kerrl, who died in office in 1941 and was not replaced.

[[File:Toasting Polish Dachau.jpg|thumb|Dachau Concentration Camp had its own [[Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp|Priests' barracks]] for clerical enemies of the Hitler regime.]]

From the mid 1930s, the Nazi movement came increasingly to be led by vehement anti-Christians, whom Hitler appointed to key positions.&lt;ref name="pp. 13–50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steigmann-Gall 2003 257–260"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bundle7"&gt;
*[[William Shirer]]; ''Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany'', p. 240, Simon and Schuster, 1990: "under the leadership of Rosenberg, Bormann and Himmler—backed by Hitler—the Nazi regime intended to destroy Christianity in Germany, if it could, and substitute the old paganism of the early tribal Germanic gods and the new paganism of the Nazi extremists".
*[[Richard Overy]]: ''The Dictators Hitler's Germany Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004. p. 287 : "From the mid 1930s the regime and party were dominated much more by the prominent anti-Christians in their ranks&amp;nbsp;– Himmler, Bormann, Heydrich&amp;nbsp;– but were restrained by Hitler, despite his anti religious sentiments, from any radical programme of de-Chritianization.&amp;nbsp;... Hitler 'expected the end of the disease of Christianity to come about by itself once its falsehoods were self evident"
*Kershaw, Ian, ''Hitler, 1889–1936: Hubris'', pp. 575–576, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; As with the "Jewish question", the radicals pushed the Church struggle forward, especially in Catholic areas, so that by the winter of 1935–1936 there was growing dissatisfaction with the Nazis in those areas.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian, ''Hitler, 1889–1936: Hubris'', pp. 575–576, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Kershaw wrote that in early 1937, Hitler again told his inner circle that though he "did not want a 'Church struggle' at this juncture", he expected "the great world struggle in a few years' time". Nevertheless, wrote Kershaw, Hitler's impatience with the churches "prompted frequent outbursts of hostility. In early 1937 he was declaring that 'Christianity was ripe for destruction', and that the Churches must yield to the "primacy of the state", railing against any compromise with "the most horrible institution imaginable". Priests were frequently denounced, arrested and sent to concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Berben; ''Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945''; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; {{ISBN|0-85211-009-X}}; pp. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Dachau Concentration Camp|Dachau]], the regime established a dedicated [[Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp|Clergy Barracks]] for church dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica: ''Dachau'', by Michael Berenbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Berben; ''Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945''; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; {{ISBN|0-85211-009-X}}; pp. 276–277.&lt;/ref&gt; The Confessing Church seminary was banned. Its leaders, like [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] were arrested.

====Long term plans for the churches====

Overy wrote that Christianity was ultimately as incompatible with National Socialism as it was with Soviet Communism and that "Hitler expected the end of the disease of Christianity to come about by itself once the falsehoods were self-evident. During the war he reflected that in the long run 'National Socialism and religion will no longer be able to exist together'."&lt;ref name="Richard Overy 2004. p.286"/&gt; Other historians have written of a more active intent on the part of Hitler and the Nazi leadership.&lt;ref name="BundleEradicate"/&gt; Kershaw noted that Hitler's scheme for the Germanization of Eastern Europe saw no place for Christian churches and that Goebbels wrote from conversations with Hitler that there was an insoluble opposition between the Christian and a Germanic-heroic world-view which would need settling after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; WW Norton &amp; Company; London p.661&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Speer|Speer]] noted in his memoir that churches were not to receive building sites in Hitler's new Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Speer.

New York: Simon and Schuster, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XLSa_RIDHMUC&amp;pg=PA96 p. 177.]&lt;/ref&gt; Bullock wrote "once the war was over, Hitler promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian Churches".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Bullock]]; [[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p 219&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazi plan was to "de-Christianise Germany after the final victory", writes historian of German Resistance [[Anton Gill]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Anton Gill|Gill, Anton]] (1994). ''An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler''. Heinemann Mandarin. 1995 paperback {{ISBN|978-0-434-29276-9}}, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; "By the latter part of the decade of the thirties church officials were well aware that the ultimate aim of Hitler and other Nazis was the total elimination of Catholicism and of the Christian religion.

In its brief of evidence for the [[Nuremberg Trials]] concerning the Nazi persecution of the churches, the American [[Office of Strategic Services]] (a forerunner to the CIA) compiled a report entitled "The Nazi Master Plan" which examined the Nazi persecution of the churches and found that the Hitler regime had a plan to subvert and destroy German Christianity.&lt;ref name="sharkey1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sharkey|first=Joe|title=Word for Word/The Case Against the Nazis; How Hitler's Forces Planned To Destroy German Christianity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/13/weekinreview/word-for-word-case-against-nazis-hitler-s-forces-planned-destroy-german.html?pagewanted=all |accessdate=2011-06-07|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonney2001"&gt;Bonney, Richard ed.

{{quotation|"National Socialism was by its very nature hostile to Christianity and the Christian churches [...] Conflict was inevitable [...] Important leaders of the National Socialist party would have liked to meet this situation by a complete extirpation of Christianity and the substitution of a purely racial religion tailored to fit the needs of National Socialist policy. This radically anti-Christian position is most significantly presented in Alfred Rosenberg's ''[[Myth of the Twentieth Century]]''...generally regarded after ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' as the most authoritative statement of National Socialist ideology. [...] Thus in a declaration of 5 November 1934, [[Baldur von Schirach]], the German youth leader declared... 'the destruction of Christianity was explicitly recognised as a purpose of the National Socialist movement'. Considerations of expediency made it impossible, however to adopt this radical anti-Christian policy officially. Thus the policy actually adopted was to reduce the influence of the Christian churches as far as possible through use of every available means, without provoking the difficulties of an open war of extermination."|OSS; The Nazi Master Plan; Annex 4: The Persecution of the Christian Churches, 6 July 1945}}

According to Kershaw, in 1937 Goebbels noted Hitler was becoming more radical on the 'Church Question', and indicated that, though current political circumstances required waiting, his long term plan was to eventually dissolve the Reich concordat with Rome, detach the church entirely from the state and turn the entire force of the party to 'the destruction of the clerics', and end the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in a 'great world showdown'.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw; Hitler 1936-1945 Nemesis; WW Norton &amp; Company; 2000; pp.40-41&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, when Bishop [[August von Galen]] protested against Nazi Euthanasia and seizures of church properties, although Hitler's sympathies lay with the radicals who wanted Galen dead and church properties seized, he calculated that this would turn Catholic areas still further against the regime. "Only the need for peace in relation with the churches to avoid deteriorating morale on the home front determined his stance", wrote Kershaw, "Events in the Warthegau (where by 1941 94% of churches and chapels in the Posen-Gnesen diocese were closed, 11 % of the clergy were murdered, and most of the remainder thrust into prisons and concentration camps) showed the face of the future."&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw; Hitler 1936-1945 Nemesis; WW Norton &amp; Company; 2000; pp.428&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Socialist movement was not formally atheist, and generally allowed religious observance.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; [[Julian Baggini]] wrote that Hitler's Germany was not a "straightforwardly atheist state", but one which "sacrilized" notions of blood and nation.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; On October 13, 1933, [[Deputy Führer]] [[Rudolf Hess]] issued a decree stating: "No National Socialist may suffer any detriment on the ground that he does not profess any particular faith or confession or on the ground that he does not make any religious profession at all."&lt;ref&gt;Baynes, Norman H. ed.

When criticised for anti-Christian sentiments in February 1933, Hitler claimed that it was the Nazis not the Catholic Centre Party that had taken on atheist politics.&lt;ref name="Norman H. Baynes 1969 p. 240"/&gt; When negotiating the concordat with the Catholic Church, Hitler said he supported religious education in schools.&lt;ref name="The German Churches Under Hitler"/&gt; Once in office however, Hitler then pursued a policy of suppression of denominational schools and church youth organizations.&lt;ref name="Nazi trial documents made public"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1753469.stm Nazi trial documents made public], BBC, 11 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Clergymen teachers were removed from virtually all state schools.&lt;ref name="The Third Reich p.157"/&gt; By 1939 all denominational schools had been disbanded or converted to public facilities.&lt;ref name="Evans, Richard J. 2005 pp. 245"/&gt; In that year, Evans notes, some 95% of Germans still called themselves Protestant or Catholic, while only 3.5% "Deist" (''[[gottgläubig]]'') and 1.5% atheist. Most in these latter categories were "convinced Nazis who had left their Church at the behest of the Party, which had been trying since the mid 1930s to reduce the influence of Christianity in society".&lt;ref name="Richard J 2009, p. 546"&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]]; ''The Third Reich at War''; Penguin Press; New York 2009, p. 546&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John S. Conway (historian)|John Conway]] notes that the majority of the three million Nazi Party members continued to pay their church taxes and register as either [[Roman Catholic]] or [[German Evangelical Church Confederation|Protestant Christians]], "despite all Rosenberg's efforts."&lt;ref name="Churches p. 232"&gt;The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933–1945, by John S. Conway p. 232; Regent College Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Aggressive anti-Church radicals like [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Martin Bormann]] saw the ''[[kirchenkampf]]'' campaign against the Churches as a priority concern, and anti-church and [[anticlerical]] sentiments were strong among grassroots party activists.&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw p.381-382"&gt;Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler: A Biography''; 2008 Edn; W. W. Norton &amp; Co; London; pp. 381–82&lt;/ref&gt; From 1938, writes Overy, "Martin Bormann, head of the Party Chancellery and a prominent party atheist, took a leading role in trying to sever all state financial support for the churches, and to limit their legal status and activities, but the need to mobilise church support for the war effort from September 1939 led, as it did in the Soviet Union after 1941, to a limited political truce between church and state."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy; ''The Dictators Hitler's Germany Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004. p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Speer considered Bormann to be the driving force behind the regime's campaign against the churches and thought that Hitler approved of his aims, but wanted to "postpone this problem to a more favourable time":&lt;ref name="Albert Speer p.123"/&gt;

====Jehovah's Witnesses====

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] numbered around 30,000 at the start of Hitler's rule in Germany. For refusing to declare loyalty to the Reich, and refusing conscription into the army, they were declared to be enemies of Germany and [[Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany|persecuted]]. About 6,000 were sent to the concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
{{See also|The Holocaust|}}

Anti-Judaism as well as racial anti-Semitism were central planks of Hitler's philosophy. His regime perpetrated the [[Final Solution]] an effort to exterminate the Jews, which resulted in the deadliest genocide in history. Hitler's ideology presented the Jews as a biological challenge to the "purity" of German blood.

It was written after a study that had convinced him that although there were many books written to praise Lawrence and others written to discredit him, all of them exaggerated his part in the [[Arab Revolt]] and failed to do justice to the Arabs themselves.&lt;ref name="ysm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dustour"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawrence English."&gt;T.E Lawrence: An Arab View; by Suleiman Mousa| Preface| Oxford University Press, London and New York, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jordantimes.com/index.php?news=1851&amp;searchFor=suleiman%20al%20musa|title=King Receives Historian Suleiman Mousa|work= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="library"/&gt;

==Life==

===Youth===
Suleiman Mousa was born to a Christian family in the village of Al Rafeed, in 1919; the village  overlooks the [[Yarmouk River]] and is located 20&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Irbid]]. The early death of his father, an unwealthy man with a passion for reading and writing, came as a shock to him, his mother and sister while Mousa was just six years old.&lt;ref name="Early Life"/&gt;
Leaving them little but a cane basket containing several books, his mother took up the task of securing the family's needs. They lived a simple and spontaneous life as part of the village that depended mainly on [[agriculture]] for its survival.&lt;ref name="p.13-21"&gt;Steps on the Road; by Suleiman Mousa| خطوات على الطريق, سيرة قلم: تجربة كاتب | p. 13-21| {{ISBN|9953-36-015-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SuleimanMousa1972.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Mousa with his mother Farha Al-Nasser wearing traditional garb in August 1972.]]
[[File:Suleiman Mousa Jaffa.jpg|thumb|left|230px|With a group of intellectuals at the Al-Marbed Poetry Festival in [[Basra]], [[Iraq]] in 1988.]]
After receiving his [[elementary education]] from religious scholars, Mousa moved to a small school known as ''Al Ta'ifa'' for three years. As were his mother's ambitions, he was then sent to a governmental school in [[Al Husn]] (الحصن), where he resided at his relatives' until May 1934, when he was unable to continue into [[high school]] due to the family's limited income. A few months later, at the age of sixteen, he took up the profession of teaching at the School of Irbid.&lt;ref name="p.13-21"/&gt;

===Employment===
In 1936 he traveled to the city of [[Haifa]] in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] where he first began working. After returning to Irbid and resuming his profession as a teacher for a brief period, he decided to make the journey to [[Jaffa]] (يافا) by train, which interconnected it with [[Damascus]] and was part of the [[Hejaz Railway]] built by the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nabataea.net/hejaz.html|title=The Hejaz Railway|work= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This journey had a significant impact on his cultural life as it was then that he started borrowing and purchasing books and novels from neighbouring libraries and fulfilling his passion of reading. He gradually learnt English using dictionaries, and published many articles in [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] newspapers as well as several [[short stories]] in 1938. As time progressed, he found himself leaning closer towards books of literature and poetry and his fascination in history developed.&lt;ref name="p.13-21"/&gt;

He returned in 1939 to Al Rafeed where he continued working in the field of education before becoming an employee in the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] in [[Mafraq]]. In 1943 he fulfilled a substantial commitment and married ''Georgette Nuseir'' whom he had met on a visit to [[Nazareth]].&lt;ref&gt;Eighty: An Autobiography (Thamanun) p.68 {{ISBN|9953-441-11-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mousa spent fifteen years in [[Mafraq]] and his publications were put close to a halt due to the inappropriate and illiterate environment he went through although he managed to publish a few short stories, articles and translations.
[[File:Suleiman Mousa 1946.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Suleiman Mousa, 1946]]
A major transformation in his life occurred when Mousa moved to [[Amman]], the Jordanian capital, and began working in the ''Jordanian Broadcasting Company'' in 1957, turning to the work of the publications service and the ''Ministry of Information and Culture'' until 1984. During that period, he was the [[editor in chief|editor]] of the Jordanian magazine ''‘Resalat Al Ordon’'' (1966 to 1967). Later on, Suleiman Mousa spent more than four years as a cultural adviser in the [[Greater Amman Municipality]] (GAM), from 1984 to 1988.&lt;ref name="ysm"&gt;Suleiman Mousa: Simplified Biography in English, by Yazan Suheil Mousa&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writer and historian==
Mousa's first book ''Al Hussein Bin Ali and the Great Arab Revolt'' was published in 1957 where it was written when the author had been resident of [[Jaffa]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in early 1939, when he was a mere nineteen years of age.&lt;ref name="p.13-21"/&gt; The printing of this book occurred after nearly seventeen years of its writing.&lt;ref&gt;Thamanun: rehlat al ayyam wal a'wam| Eighty; An Autobiography, by Suleiman Mousa| pg 32| {{ISBN|9953-441-11-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most prominent works of Suleiman Mousa is ''[[Suleiman Mousa#T.E. Lawrence: An Arab View|T.E. Lawrence: An Arab View]]'', which has been translated into English, French and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;T.E Lawrence: An Arab View; By Suleiman Mousa (Japanese Edition) {{ISBN|4-12-203991-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a turning point for the author Mousa that has taken him to world fame. He showed the Arab's point of view about battles and events of The Great [[Arab Revolt]], and also came in response to the British book written by Lawrence himself,&lt;ref name="Lawrence English."/&gt; who did not give the Arabs their right to the full extent. The author shows that Arabs fought in large numbers in the combat revolt against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] rule for independence and freedom, and that they are the ones who fought and struggled, while Lawrence was merely an officer like any other in the [[British Army]].&lt;ref name="ysm"/&gt;

While the author was resident of Jaffa in 1937, his activities were expanded to English as well as Arabic history books and he purchased several books in English of which most important were ''[[The Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'' by Lawrence and ''[[The Arab Awakening]]'', by [[George Antonius]], which emerged in its first edition in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;''Steps on the Road'' (Khutwat Ala ALtareeq) p.16 {{ISBN|9953-36-015-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Mousa wrote in regard to his interest in English:
{{cquote|''An Arab writer must, with no doubt, know a language - in addition to his mother tongue - if he wishes to keep up with the course of world cultures and interact with them.''&lt;ref&gt;Steps on the Road (Khutwat Ala Altareeq) p.20 {{ISBN|9953-36-015-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''T.E. Lawrence: An Arab View''===
[[File:T.E.Lawrence-An Arab View.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Suleiman Mousa#T.E. Lawrence: An Arab View|T.E. Lawrence: An Arab View]], the only book that shows the Arab perspective on [[Lawrence of Arabia]].]]
Of the articles written by Suleiman Mousa in [[Jaffa]] that sparked widespread attention was an article published by the name "Lawrence on the balance" ({{lang|ar|لورنس في الميزان}}) in ''Al Adab'' ({{lang|ar|الآداب}}) magazine (November 1955) which discussed the book written by [[Richard Aldington]] called ''Lawrence of Arabia: A Biographical Inquiry'', which had appeared in Britain earlier that year.
The idea of writing a book discussing the matter in an integrated manner from an Arab's perspective was based on the success the eight-page article received.&lt;ref name="ysm"/&gt;

Five years later, the first Arabic edition of the book was published by the name ''T.E. Lawrence: An Arab View'' ({{lang|ar|لورنس والعرب: وجهة نظر عربية}}) followed by the translations into English in 1966, French in 1973 and Japanese in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;''Eighty: An Autobiography'' (Thamanun) p.80-81 {{ISBN|9953-441-11-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book was translated into English by Dr. Albert Boutros,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=T.E. Lawrence; by Historian Suleiman Mousa ; translated [from the Arabic] by Albert Butros|url=http://openlibrary.org/b/OL15120760M/T.-E.-Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt; a professor of English at the [[University of Jordan]]. Many Arab and [[Western world|Western]] references were used for its writing. Mousa was visited by senior Western writers, including professors [[Colin Wilson]] and [[Jeremy Wilson]]. To this day, his book remains the only one that shows the Arab viewpoint. It has left a deep impact on all researchers interested in Lawrence. Hence, the book has won global reputation, and became a reference to researchers about the subject of Lawrence and the [[Great Arab Revolt]].

Being taught in Arab and foreign universities including the [[University of Oxford]] in Britain is a sure sign of the success and attention this book has drawn. It was Professor Eugene Rogan from the University of Oxford who had remarked in a July 2000 speech:
{{cquote|''Suleiman Mousa drew the attention of Western readers when he published his famous book ‘T.E Lawrence: An Arab View'. Indeed, the professors in the history of the Middle East in Western countries consider Mousa's books valuable research material. The book ''Days unforgotten: Jordan in the 1948 war'' is considered the best book written in Arabic about the 1948 war ... I hope that Western researchers continue expressing their gratitude to Suleiman Mousa for the credit he has provided them with.''

''Beginning with his landmark history of Jordan, written in 1985 ... and running through a long list of books and scholarly articles written in Arabic and English, the Western historian of the region seldom embarks on a new subject without finding that Suleiman Mousa has been  there first. In this sense, we are all students of Suleiman Mousa ... And so, on behalf of my Western colleagues, I wish to extend this word of appreciation to the great master of Jordanian history.''}}

===Internationally and Locally===
:''Further information: [[Suleiman Mousa#Awards and honors|Awards and honors]]''

Suleiman Mousa, in addition to being a recognized researcher who achieved a breakthrough intellectually and in the [[Arab World]], was also a local ‘people's’ author.&lt;ref&gt;''Suleiman Mousa: Internationally and Locally'', by Issam Suleiman Mousa&lt;/ref&gt;
He wrote in four major themes: Biographies, [[history of Jordan]], history of Arab revolution and writings in literature and short stories, in addition to the translations of Arabic and several simplified books written for young people.
Mousa relied on many diverse Arab, British and foreign sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mousa was dependent on Arab as well as foreign sources/الموسى: اعتمدت في تأريخ الثورة العربية الكبرى على المصادر العربية والبريطانية/ Addustour News/ |url=http://www.addustour.com/ViewarchiveTopic.aspx?ac=\localandgover\2007\08\localnews_issue15566_day31_id282723.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Suleiman Mousa King Hussein.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Mousa (right) with [[Hussein bin Talal]] (middle), then King of Jordan]]
He went to the [[Public Record Office]] in the United Kingdom in 1974 and spent four months researching documents relating to Jordan. Therefore, his works are considered indispensable references for many students and researchers.

Mousa won many awards in recognition of his contributions to Jordanian and [[Arab history]] including: ''The Order of Independence in 1971, [[King Abdullah I]] Award for research in Islamic civilization in 1988, the State Incentive prize in 1990, the Order of Al Hussein distinguished first class in 2007'' and ''Medal of the Arab Author'' after his death in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=أبو دية|first1=سعد|title=سليمان الموسى: رجل وثائق أغرقت مؤلفاته المكتبات الأردنية|url=http://alghad.com/articles/712219-%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%89-%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%84-%D9%88%D8%AB%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%82-%D8%A3%D8%BA%D8%B1%D9%82%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%A4%D9%84%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9|accessdate=4 May 2018|work=al-Ghad|date=January 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Suleiman Mousa died on 9 June 2008, in [[Amman]], Jordan two days prior of his eighty-ninth birthday. He died of [[congestive heart failure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Historian, author Suleiman Mousa passes away|url=http://www.jordantimes.com/index.php?news=9279&amp;searchFor=suleiman%20mousa}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cultural officials participated in the funeral and [[wake_(ceremony)|wake]] as well as representatives of his majesty [[King Abdullah II]] of Jordan, the Ministry of Culture, the media and many more of whom have praised his contributions in various creative fields.&lt;ref name="dustour"&gt;{{cite news| title=Addustour News; Suleiman Mousa in Gods grace|url=http://www.addustour.com/ViewarchiveTopic.aspx?ac=\localandgover\2008\06\localandgover_issue246_day10_id57007.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous recognition==
Although Suleiman Mousa received numerous awards and honors during his lifetime, many projects have been launched posthumously in recognition of the contributions he has made to Jordanian, Middle Eastern and World history. The establishment of the [[Suleiman Mousa#Library of Suleiman Mousa|Library of Suleiman Mousa]] at the (GAM),&lt;ref name="library"/&gt; and the republishing of his complete [[Suleiman Mousa#Works|works]] in several stages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ammancity100.jo/en/content/news-and-media/intellectuals-and-officials-launched-project-republish-books-late-jordanian-h Amman Centennial, Intellectuals and officials launched a project to republish books by the late Jordanian historian Suleiman Musa]&lt;/ref&gt; with an ''"aim of introducing history to the new generation"'', are amongst the most prominent of these projects.&lt;ref name="library1"&gt;http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Greater+Amman+Municipality+Inaugurates+Sulaiman+Mousa+Library+Next...-a0209998096&lt;/ref&gt; Mousa was also awarded ''The Arab Author Medal'' in 2008 after his death.

===Library of Suleiman Mousa===
[[File:Suleiman Mousa Library.jpg|thumb|left|230px|''Library of Suleiman Mousa'' at Al Hussein Cultural Center of the [[Greater Amman Municipality]] (GAM).]]On 11 November 2009, a library dedicated for the [[history of Jordan]] under the name of Suleiman Mousa,&lt;ref name="library1"/&gt; located at Al Hussein Cultural Center of the GAM, was inaugurated on behalf of the former Mayor of Amman, [[Omar Maani]].&lt;ref name="library"&gt;http://www.ammancity.gov.jo/en/resource/snews.asp?id=1264&lt;/ref&gt;

The library is divided into several sections, one for the titles related to the history of Jordan in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], English and [[French language|French]]. Another is allocated for books and personal possessions of Suleiman Mousa,&lt;ref name="library1"/&gt; as well as some documents he had been collecting during his work in writing, which his family donated to the library. At the [[inauguration]], City Deputy Manager for Cultural, Social, and Sports Affairs, ''Haitham Jweinat'', referred to the uniqueness of the new library, and said that it will be open for all interested readers and researchers, noting that the GAM had taken the time to equip it with many facilities, including an internet [[local area network]] (LAN) and the availability of international magazines and newspapers.&lt;ref name="library"/&gt;&lt;ref name="libraryweb"&gt;http://www.ammanpl.gov.jo/solaiman.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The library regularly receives visitors from schools and universities to introduce them to [[History of the Middle East|Middle Eastern history]] through documentaries, photos and library resources.&lt;ref name="library1"/&gt; Several scientific seminars and conferences have already taken place at the library. Its goal is to become one of the important developmental and economical projects in Jordan, and the place to launch books related to [[Arab people#History|Arab history]] and the history of Jordan.&lt;ref name="library"/&gt;&lt;ref name="libraryweb"/&gt;

==Reviews of ''T.E. Lawrence: An Arab View''==

:''"Although many admirers of T.E. will prefer Lawrence's version of his part in the Arab Revolt, Mr. Mousa's obvious concern to be fair-minded and the weight of the evidence he produces makes his book one that must be studied by all who are interested in 'Lawrence of Arabia'. "'' - [[Oxford University Press]], 1966

:''"...and if only for this passionate and compassionate, rehearsal of the bitter betrayal of Arab hopes in the interests of European power politics, this book (T.E. Lawrence: An Arab View) is worth reading. For, after all, therein lies the root of distrust which has poised Arab relations with the west for the past five decades."'' - [[Anthony Nutting]], ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' News; 10 July 1966

:''"...However "nationalist" Mr. Mousa may be, he has been painstakingly, tediously thorough in examining this material and in assembling such evidence of Arab opinion as he could obtain..."'' - The ''Standard Times'', 12 March 1967

:''"...The book needed writing and deserves reading...He writes honestly, stating his evidence fairly, and his book merits the serious consideration it asks,"'' - ''[[Birmingham Post]]'', 9 July 1966

:''"...is the first scholarly account to give the Arab view, and it is a highly persuasive and thoroughly researched examination of the Lawrence story...Mousa is an intelligent and passionate advocate of the Arab view..."'' - ''[[Quarterly Review]]'', Summer 1967

:''"In T. E. Lawrence: An Arab View, Suleiman Mousa gathers a great variety of such details in an attempt to destroy the Lawrence myth. He is offended by Lawrence's egotism and has worked hard to restore the historical record to its proper proportions."''- ''[[Michigan Quarterly Review]]'', Summer 1969&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/mqrarchive/act2080.0008.003?node=act2080.0008.003:12&amp;view=text&amp;seq=73|title= A Man For All Seasons: T. E. Lawrence [Volume VIII, Issue: 3, Summer 1969, pp. 208-211, Author: Bailey, Richard W.
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''"Suleiman Mousa's work had a deep and lasting influence over T.E. Lawrence scholarship.  It showed how different those events looked through Arab eyes, and taught us to question the assumption that things happened - only, or indeed at all - because Lawrence wanted them to happen.''
:''I believe that, in the long run, Western and Arab historians will reach a common view of the history of the Arab Revolt, based on all the evidence that has survived. By challenging the accepted Western view, Suleiman Mousa played an important part in that process. For that he deserves lasting recognition.".''- British historian, [[Jeremy Wilson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.telstudies.org/2008/06/10/suleiman-mousa/|title=Suleiman Mousa - Jeremy Wilson|accessdate=2008-06-18 |work= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Flower of Gloster''''' is a 1911 book by [[E. Temple Thurston]] (23 September 1879 – 19 March 1933), an Anglo-Irish poet, playwright and author. Published by [[Williams and Norgate]],&lt;ref name="Times1911Oct20"&gt;{{cite newspaper The Times|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=hamlib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS135724372&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|articlename=The "Flower of Gloster"|section=Display Advertising|date=20 October 1911|page_number=8|issue=39721|accessdate=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; it sold well enough to merit a second edition two years later. A third unillustrated edition was published by [[Chapman and Hall]] in 1918, after which the book remained out of print for over half a century until being republished by [[David &amp; Charles]] in 1968. A year before that, ITV had broadcast a 13-part children's serial of the same name (loosely) based on Thurston's original narrative.&lt;ref name="Times1967Sep27"&gt;{{cite newspaper The Times|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=hamlib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS235105595&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|articlename=Television and radio programmes|section=Arts and Entertainment|date=27 September 1967|page_number=14|issue=57057|accessdate=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The book==
Themple Thurston's original book opens with the author dreaming of escape to the English countryside and trying to buy a narrowboat from which to see it. After meeting with scepticism and warnings about the unsavoury nature of canal people, he is advised to go to [[Oxford]] to view The Flower of Gloster. The boatyard owner, similarly sceptical, advises him to hire 'some decent fellar with an horse, what'll look after yer going through the locks.'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Temple Thurston |first=E.|title=The Flower of Gloster |chapter=Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduces him to Eynsham Harry who, after some protracted negotiations in The Nags Head, agrees to be Temple Thurston's guide and mentor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Temple Thurston |first=E.|title=The Flower of Gloster |chapter=Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their journey takes them first along the [[Oxford Canal]] to just north of [[Banbury]], where they join the sprawling network of [[The Midlands|Midlands]] canals. They head north through [[Warwick]] and [[Leamington Spa]], but as they near the heavily industralised landscape of the [[Black Country]] Temple Thurston begins to have some doubts about continuing and beseeches Eynsham Harry to turn the boat around – no easy task! - and head back via the [[Stratford-upon-Avon Canal]] to the pastoral landscapes they have so recently passed through.&lt;ref&gt;''Flower of Gloster''. Temple Thurston, E, Williams &amp; Norgate, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point in the journey, Temple Thurston abandoned the canal in order to walk along the [[River Avon, Warwickshire|River Avon]] to [[Evesham]] and [[Tewkesbury]], where het met up again with Eynsham Harry and The Flower of Gloster. According to David Viner's analysis of the text, the seemingly simple circuit of Oxford-Banbury-Warwick-Stratford-Tewkesbury-Oxford would not have been as straightforward as the author portrays it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Temple Thurston |first=E. |editor-last=Viner |editor-first=David |title=The Flower of Gloster |date=1984 |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viner questions whether the journey ever took place in its entirety, the story was a composite of several journeys or canalside visits made on separate occasions. Whatever the truth, Viner concluded that none of the doubts on the literal interpretation of the journey detract from the book's value as a 'good read', an example of Edwardian romanticism, or its influence on canal history which has now lasted over a century.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flower of Gloster'' (illustrated edition), Viner, David, Alan Sutton Publishing, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to be the last person to navigate the [[Thames and Severn Canal]].

==Influence==
Setting down his own experiences thirty years later in his book ''Narrow Boat'', historian [[L.T.C. Rolt]] referred to ''The Flower of Gloster'' with delight, saying that it held pride of place in his own tiny collection of canal literature, the only professional account to have appeared in the previous fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;''Narrow Boat'', Rolt, L.T.C., Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode, 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustrations==
The 1911 edition of Flower of Gloster included six watercolour scenes and numerous line drawings, all by Scottish artist W.R. Dakin and based on the author's photographs. The illustrations appear to have been a large part of the book's appeal and in its review of 'a delightful book' ''[[The Westminster Gazette]]'' said that the illustrations were 'among the sincerest, most spontaneous and charming ever seen in modern books'.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Westminster Gazette]]'', 1911 (exact date unknown)&lt;/ref&gt;'' [[The Scotsman]]'''s reviewer noted that the book's value was heightened by 'the excellent sketches by W.R. Dakin in black and white and colours'.&lt;ref&gt;'' [[The Scotsman]]'', 26 October 1911&lt;/ref&gt; Dakin was a contributor to [[The Bookman (London)|The Bookman]], a monthly review magazine. As editor of the 1968 David &amp; Charles edition, L.T.C. Rolt dropped Dakin's watercolours in favour of eight of Temple Thurston's original photographs. The photographs were kept for the 1984 book, mixed in with many more contemporary photographs which editor David Viner&lt;ref name="cotswoldarchaeology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldarchaeology.co.uk/mr-david-viner/|publisher=cotswoldarchaeology.co.uk|title=Mr David Viner : Cotswold Archaeology|accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; thought gave Temple Thurston's account a 'period feel' as it was a time of great activity for photographers recording social life and customs for use as postcards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Temple Thurston |first=E. |editor-last=Viner |editor-first=David |title=The Flower of Gloster |date=1984 |chapter=Commentary to the Illustrations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American edition==
An American edition was published by [[Dodd, Mead and Company]] in 1912. The US version was identical to the first British editions apart from the original ‘[[Art Deco]]’ cover, which was changed to include an illustration of a boat more in tune with the American concept of a canal barge

==TV serial==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Flower Of Gloster TVTimes 1967.jpg|thumb|right|Publicity shot for the TV series]] --&gt;In 1967, [[Granada TV]] broadcast a 13-part children's serial called ''The Flower of Gloster'', loosely based on Thurston's original. When their boatyard owner father is taken ill, his eldest son Dick, accompanied by siblings 10-year-old Michael and 12-year-old Elizabeth, volunteers to deliver a narrow-boat – The Flower of Gloster - to a buyer on his behalf. During their 220-mile trip south they make new friends, face dangers and difficulties, played out against the changing patterns of the British countryside. Their course winds its way from Wales, through the inland waterways of England to the Pool of London at Tower Bridge.

It was the first Granada TV series to be filmed in colour (though initially transmitted in black and white). Professional actors [[Richard O'Callaghan]] and [[Annette Robertson]], were cast alongside  real-life siblings Elizabeth and Mike Doherty playing the younger children. Also appearing were many of the real-life canal folk, by then an almost extinct as a breed.

The TV serial was followed a few years later by a book of the same name, authored by the  producer [[Bill Grundy]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Flower of Gloster''. Grundy, Bill, Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd, London, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Grundy intended the series to be educational as much as adventure, with information about geology and wildlife. He claimed to have got the idea after visiting a rally near his home in [[Marple, Greater Manchester|Marple]]&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Bill Grundy, ''TV Times'', 23–29 September 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodore Metochites''' ({{lang-el|Θεόδωρος Μετοχίτης}}; 1270–1332) was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] statesman, author, gentleman philosopher, and patron of the arts. From c. 1305 to 1328 he held the position of personal adviser (''[[mesazon|mesazōn]]'') to emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]].

== Life ==
Metochites was born in [[Constantinople]] as the son of the [[archdeacon]] [[George Metochites]], a fervent supporter of the [[Second Council of Lyons|union of the Orthodox and Catholic Churches]]. After the [[Council of Blachernae (1285)|Council of Blachernae]], his father was condemned and exiled, and Metochites seems to have spent his adolescence in the monastic milieux of [[Bithynia]] in [[Asia Minor]]. He devoted himself to studies of both secular and religious authors. When Andronicus II visited [[Nicaea]] in 1290/1291, Metochites made such an impression on him that he was immediately called to the court and made [[Logothete of the Herds]]. Little more than a year later, he was appointed a Senator. Besides carrying out his political duties (embassies to [[Cilicia]] in 1295 and to [[Serbia]] in 1299), Metochites continued to study and to write. In 1312/1313, he started learning astronomy from [[Manuel Bryennios]]; later he himself became the teacher of [[Nicephorus Gregoras]]. He was married with five sons and one daughter, Irene (spouse of [[List of Byzantine usurpers|John Komnenos Palaiologos]]).

Metochites’ political career culminated in 1321, when he was invested as [[Grand Logothete]]. He was then at the summit of his power, and also one of the richest men of his age. Some of the money was spent on restoring and decorating the [[Chora Church|church of the Chora monastery]] in the northwest of Constantinople, where Metochites’ [[donor portrait]] can still be seen in a famous [[mosaic]] in the [[narthex]], above the entrance to the nave.

Metochites’ fortunes were, however, linked with his emperor’s. After a few years of intermittent civil war, Andronicus II was overthrown in 1328 by his own grandson, [[Andronicus III Palaeologus]]. Metochites went down with him. He was deprived of his possessions and forced into exile in [[Didymoteicho]]n. In 1330, he was allowed to return to Constantinople. He then withdrew to Chora, where he died on 13 March 1332, having adopted the monastic name Theoleptos.

== Works ==
Metochites’ extant œuvre comprises 20 ''Poems'' in [[dactylic hexameter]], 18 orations (''Logoi''), ''Commentaries'' on [[Aristotle]]’s writings on [[natural philosophy]], an introduction to the study of [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] astronomy (''Stoicheiosis astronomike''), and 120 [[essay]]s on various subjects, the ''Semeioseis gnomikai''. Many of these works are still unedited.

Some say that the term means semi-naked, arguing that it is unlikely that a [[Jewish]] person would go completely unclothed in public, although others argue that fishermen in the Sea of Galilee did actually work naked.&lt;ref&gt;Neil, James.

According to legend, his wife [[Godgyfu]] begged him to reduce the tax, and he told her that she had to ride naked through the city's market before he would do it. Godgyfu, remembered as [[Lady Godiva]], accepted the challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/1507606.stm|title=Lady Godiva: The naked truth|publisher=[[BBC]] News|date=2001-08-24|accessdate=2006-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Kamakura period|Kamakura-period]] Japan (1185–1333), religious bathing was provided to the public free of charge, with no concept of gender segregation. After the collapse of free services, a for-pay system emerged which later evolved to become the modern day [[sentō]].

'''Timothy Webster''' (March 12, 1822 &amp;ndash; April 29, 1862), [[Allan Pinkerton|Pinkerton]] agent and [[American Civil War spies|Union spy]], was the first spy in the [[American Civil War]] to be executed.

==Early life==
Webster came to America with his parents in August 1830 and settled in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. He became a policeman in New York City sometime before 1850. He met Allan Pinkerton in 1853 and took a job with Pinkerton's private detective agency in 1856.&lt;ref name="Recko"&gt;Recko (2013) A Spy for the Union: The Life and Execution of Timothy Webster.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Webster married Charlotte Sprowles on October 23, 1841 in Princeton, New Jersey and the couple had four children, two of whom died young. Their son, Timothy Jr., born in 1843, joined the Union Army from Onarga, Illinois on July 30, 1862 and was wounded in the [[Battle of Brices Crossroads]] near [[Ripley, Mississippi]] on June 11, 1864, and taken to a Confederate prison in [[Mobile, Alabama]] where his leg was amputated. He subsequently died there on July 4, 1864. His body was transported north to Onarga, Illinois and buried in the Onarga Cemetery next to his grandfather, Timothy Webster Sr., who died in Onarga in 1860.&lt;ref name="Goff"&gt;&gt;Goff (2000) Timothy Webster the story of the Civil War spy and his family.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War==
In early 1861, Pinkerton sent Webster and [[Hattie Lawton]] to pose as a Southern gentleman and wife (Mrs. Webster) in the Baltimore area and became a member of a pro-Southern group in order to report on secessionists' plans and activities.&lt;ref name="Beymer"&gt;Beymer (1910) Timothy Webster:Spy.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the information provided by Webster gave support to Pinkerton's assertion that there was a [[Baltimore Plot]] to assassinate Lincoln as he moved through Baltimore on his way to his inauguration in 1861.

After the outbreak of war, Pinkerton began to provide agents to the Union armies under [[George B. McClellan]]. Webster continued to gather information on the Confederacy from 1861 through 1862 in southern Maryland and [[Richmond, Virginia]]. In Richmond in 1862 he was stricken with inflammatory rheumatism&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Intelligence in the Civil War, CIA Publication

https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/intelligence-history/civil-war/Intel_in_the_CW1.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; and was too ill to send reports back to Pinkerton. As a result, Pinkerton sent Pryce Lewis and John Scully to locate Webster.&lt;ref name="Beymer"/&gt; The two men were recognized as being Union spies&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and captured by the Confederacy. Scully eventually revealed information that caused Webster and Lawton to be arrested.&lt;ref name="Beymer"/&gt;
        
Confederate officers had trusted Webster many times with valuable documents and information and the Confederacy was extremely embarrassed by Webster's betrayal. While Lewis and Scully were eventually released, Webster was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death by hanging. Hattie Lawton was imprisoned and later released in an exchange of prisoners.

==Death==
When Pinkerton heard the news of the sentence, he and President Lincoln sent a message to the Confederacy threatening that if Webster was put to death, the Union would reciprocate by hanging a Confederate spy.&lt;ref name="Fishel"&gt;Fishel (1996). The Secret War for The Union.&lt;/ref&gt; Union policy had been to keep Confederate spies in jail and exchange them for Union prisoners. 

The Confederacy ignored the threat&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and on April 29, 1862, Timothy Webster climbed the gallows in Richmond, Virginia at Camp Lee.&lt;ref name="Fishel"/&gt; After the initial attempt to hang Webster failed, he was helped to the gallows again and was heard to say,  "I suffer a double death!" before being killed on the second attempt.&lt;ref name="Beymer"&gt;Beymer (1910) Timothy Webster:Spy.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was buried in Richmond, but in 1871, Pinkerton sent George Bangs and Thomas G. Robinson (Timothy's son-in-law) to Richmond to locate his body and bring it to [[Onarga, Illinois]] for burial. He was buried next to his father, Timothy Webster Sr., and his son, Timothy Webster Jr.&lt;ref name="Goff"/&gt;

The '''Tomb of the Diver''' is an  archaeological monument, built in about 470 BC and found by the Italian [[archaeologist]] Mario Napoli on 3 June 1968 during his excavation of a small [[necropolis]] about 1.5&amp;nbsp;km south of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city of [[Paestum]] in [[Magna Graecia]], in what is now southern [[Italy]]. The tomb is now displayed in the museum at Paestum.

It is a [[grave (burial)|grave]] made of five local [[limestone]] slabs forming the four lateral walls and the roof, the floor being excavated in the natural rock ground. The five slabs, accurately bonded with [[plaster]], formed a chamber sized — roughly – 215 × 100 × 80&amp;nbsp;cm (7.1 × 3.3 × 2.6&amp;nbsp;ft). All five slabs forming the monument were painted on the interior sides using a ''[[Fresco|true fresco]]'' technique. The paintings on the four walls depict a [[symposium]] scene, while the cover slab shows the famous scene that gives the tomb its name: a young man diving into a curling and waving stream of water.  Two masters have been distinguished, the south wall being by a less impressive artist than the others.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the tomb was discovered, these surprising frescos revealed its importance as they appear to be the "only example of Greek painting with figured scenes dating from the [[Orientalizing]], [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic]], or [[Classical Greece|Classical]] periods to survive in its entirety. Among the thousands of Greek tombs known from this time (roughly 700–400 BC), this is the only one to have been decorated with frescoes of human subjects."&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was presumably inspired by the many [[Etruscan art|Etruscan painted tombs]]; Paestum was at the time a few miles from the border of the Greek and Etruscan zones of influence at the [[River Sele]].  Wall-paintings in other types of building were common in the Greek world, but survivals are extremely rare.

The local [[Campanians]], who had taken control of Paestum by about 400 BC, left many painted tombs, mostly showing an obsession with horse and equine sport.  Several of these are also in the museum in Paestum.     

In the interior of the tomb, only a few objects were found: near the corpse (widely supposed to be a young man, despite the heavily deteriorated state of the skeleton) were a turtle shell,&lt;ref&gt;Probably part of a ''[[lyre]]'' whose wooden frame had rotted away.&lt;/ref&gt; two ''[[aryballos|arýballoi]]'' and an [[Attica|Attic]] ''[[lekythos]]''. This last object, in [[black-figure pottery|black-figure]] technique from about 480 BC, helped the discoverer and other scholars to date the tomb to about 470 BC.

The '''Trabancos''' is a river in Spain that flows between the Zapardiel and the Guareña rivers, and is a tributary of the [[Douro|Duero river]]. The source of the Trabancos is in [[Moraña]], a region in the north of the [[Ávila (province)|province of Ávila]], near Blascomillán. The Trabancos is at an elevation of approximately {{convert|1100|m|ft}}, is approximately {{convert|85|km|mi}} long and, although its [[Stream bed|river bed]] is stable, only has a constant water flow during and immediately after [[Extreme weather|torrential rains]].

==Fluvial geomorphology==
From its source in the province of Ávila, to its mouth in the village of Pollos ''("Village of Chickens" in Spanish)'' in the [[Valladolid (province)|Vallisoletana]] (''"confluence of waters"'') region, the course of the Trabancos is markedly affected by a [[geologic fault]] originating in the [[Tertiary|Tertiary era]]—likely pre-[[Pliocene]] that, like most of the observed [[Geologic fault|faults]] of that [[Geologic time scale|geological era]], follows a NNE-SSW direction. As shown in the graph below, the fault separates material laid down during the [[Oligocene]] epoch on the right margin, from material laid down during the [[Miocene]] epoch on the left margin. The surface level represents material deposited during the [[Quaternary]] period.

Archeological research in areas that surround the Trabancos River, between the villages of Castrejón and Pollos ([[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid province]]) have been compared with the specialized bibliography and the published geological charts (''infra''). This produced identified a sequence of [[river terrace]]s as follows, on the left hand margin of the chart: '''TT-1 platform''' (the most ancient, at +35/40 meters over the [[flood plain]]); the '''TT-2 platform''' (the second one at +25/30 meters); the '''TT-3 platform''' (at +15 meters over the [[floodplain]]); and the '''TT-4 platform''' (at +10 meters, the last and most recent).

The right hand margin of the designated chart depicts a ''gravel plateau'' present along the middle and final courses of the Trabancos River. The scientist Alfredo Pérez-Gonzalez named this formation ''"Superficie de Alaejos"'' ("The Plateau of Alaejos", after a nearby village). The Alaejos Plateau incorporates a number of different types of materials, including [[Alfisols|red argillic soil]] and a [[colluvium]] buildup of [[gravel]]s with rounded stones of [[quartz]] and [[quartzite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Pérez-González, A.|title = El Cuaternario de la región central de la Cuenca del Duero y sus principales rasgos geomorfológicos.| year = 1982| publisher = Actas de la 1ª Reunión Regional sobre la Geología de la Cuenca del Duero ([[Salamanca]] 1979)| volume = Temas Geológico-Mineros IV.| pages= 730–731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terraces of the Trabancos River only occur on the left hand side of the valley. Their sediments overlie [[miocene|Miocene sediments]]. This is the result of a hard slope in the opposite margin, where the terrain is heavily eroded, which renders the formation and maintenance of river terraces impossible.

[[File:Cross section Trabancos River.gif|thumb|left|463px|&lt;center&gt;Cross section, depicting the [[Geologic fault|fault]] that affects the middle and final courses of the Trabancos River&lt;br/&gt;as well as the sequence of its [[river terrace]]s&lt;/center&gt;]]

Of the previously mentioned river terraces, the one known as '''TT-4''' is only visible near ''Narros del Castillo'' ([[Avila (province)|Ávila]]). Terrace '''TT-3''' is the best preserved of the lot; although its height on the bed of the stream is not constant, it clearly stands out on the [[floodplain]]. Terrace '''TT-2''' is quite well preserved as well, although it has been more heavily sculptured by other small tributaries of the Trabancos River. By contrast, terrace '''TT-1''' is greatly eroded; although some sections survive to the south of the municipality of ''Alaejos'' ([[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]]), they are very difficult to differentiate from the [[colluvium]] floor that covers the ''Superficie de Alaejos''. Entering into land in the municipality of ''Pollos'', the stream stops to form river terraces, cutting traversely and lowering enough (between 40 and 60 meters) to meet the terrace deposits of the [[Duero River]].

The TT-3 platform features a very compact and thick [[Miocene]] epoch [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] formed of [[pebble|river-smoothed pebbles]] of [[quartzite]], most likely cut by the Trabancos River ages ago, and cemented together by [[chalk]] and [[sandstone]] materials. While this Miocene conglomerate emerges from the banks of each river terrace, the quartzite in the conglomerate on the TT-2 platform, just northwest of the municipality of Siete Iglesias de Trabancos, likely derives from the action of the Duero River rather than the Trabancos River, as a slope in the terrain is thought to have caused the formation of an [[alluvial fan]] that deposited quartzite on the fluvial fossil river bed of the Trabancos.

The fact that the river terraces of the Trabancos River cut and cross some terraces of the Duero River indicates the affected Duero River terraces are younger than those not formed from activity of the waters of this river. The ''"superficie de Alaejos"'' carve-out intrudes 4 to 6 meters into the Duero River terrace designated TD-7 (+74/80 m) to the northwest of Siete Iglesias de Trabancos village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Pérez-González, A.| title = El Cuaternario de la región central de la Cuenca del Duero y sus principales rasgos geomorfológicos.| year = 1982| publisher = Actas de la 1ª Reunión Regional sobre la Geología de la Cuenca del Duero ([[Salamanca]] 1979)| volume = Temas Geológico-Mineros IV.| pages =733 and cuadro 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the TT-2 fluvial terrace of Trabancos cuts some Duero River terraces. Since the previously mentioned Duero River terrace named TD-7 has been dated by Alfredo Pérez-González (op.cit.) to the beginning of the [[Middle Pleistocene]], meaning the river terraces of Trabancos River are younger than the  "Superficie de Alaejos", it appears plausible that this postdates the creation of Trabancos valley: the proposed date could, thus, be halfway through the [[Middle Pleistocene]] or later.

Although the eastern portion of the river is of insignificant ''[[hydrography|hydrographic]]'' importance, at least until the 13th century, it played an important role in the history of the North Spanish Plateau.

===Prehistoric era===
Evidence of [[prehistoric]] human habitation has been unearthed in hillsides in some areas of ''[[List of municipalities in Ávila|Narros del Castillo]]'' ([[Ávila (province)|Ávila]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Santonja, Manuel y Pérez González, Alfredo| title = Las industrias paleolíticas de la Maya I en su ámbito regional (E.A.E.).| year = 1984| publisher = [http://www.mcu.es/index.jsp Ministerio de Cultura], [http://www.mcu.es/jsp/plantilla_wai.jsp?area=organizacion&amp;id=904 Dirección General de Bellas Artes y Archivos]| isbn = 84-505-0620-4|pages= 90–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[List of municipalities in Valladolid|Siete Iglesias de Trabancos]]'' ([[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Benito Álvarez, José-Manuel y Benito Álvarez, Félix| title = Investigaciones arqueológicas en el curso medio/final del valle del río Trabancos| year = 1982| publisher = III&lt;sup&gt;er&lt;/sup&gt; Encuentro Internacional de Jóvenes Investigadores, [[Salamanca]], 1982| volume = Cuadernos del [http://www.inice.org/ I. N. I. C. E.] de Investigación Juvenil| ISSN= 0211-5875 |pages=17–18, 208–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; dating from the Quaternary period, and have been further pinpointed as originating in the lower [[Paleolithic]] era. At both sites, collections of lithic stone artifacts [[Flintknapper|knapped]] during the  [[Acheulean|Acheulean period]] are found on the surface (not as a result of archeological excavation), including centripetally knapped [[lithic core]]s, others displaying non-arranged [[lithic reduction]], as well as [[lithic flake]]s characteristic of both the [[Levallois technique|Levallois]] and Kombewa techniques, [[chopping tool]]s, and [[handaxe]]s.

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;small&gt;Lithic artifacts and tools from the [[Acheulean]] culture found in the fluvial quaternary terraces of Trabancos&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Only ambiguous archaeological evidence has been found dating from the [[Hispania#Roman Hispania|late Roman period]]. It has been suggested by some that this is a result of the severity of the land and weather in the Trabancos valley and its surrounding regions. Possibly, during the [[Hispania#Prehistory and Early History|pre-Roman period]] the territory was a no-man's-land between the Hispanic tribes of the [[Vaccei]] and [[Vettones|Vettoni]].

Some archaeological remains have been found in the municipality of ''Siete iglesias de Trabancos'' ([[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]]), but they are not well preserved, having been situated on the surface of the terrain. Such remains consist of, for instance, broken pieces of comb-decorated pottery that appear to date from Spain's [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Palol, P. y Wattemberg, F.| title = Carta arqueológica de España: Valladolid.| year = 1974| publisher = [http://www.diputaciondevalladolid.es/presentacion.shtml Diputación de Valladolid]| id = Página 143}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are few other examples of prehistoric findings directly along the Trabancos river. However, in the surrounding regions, such as the municipality of ''Alaejos'' ([[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]]), archaeological investigation has unearthed several human [[inhumation|burial]]s sites that have been dated to the Bronze Age. In addition, some prehistoric remains have been found near the mouth of the Trabancos River, in ''Pollos'' village that originated from the [[Duero River]]. These include relics of the [[Urnfield#Pottery|Spanish Bronze Age]] classified as ''[[w:es:Las Cogotas|Cogotas]]'' pottery, as well as ''Proto-Cogotas'' pottery, both featuring incised decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Mañanes, Tomás| title = Arqueología Vallisoletana (I): La Tierra de Campos y el Sur del Duero.| year = 1979| publisher = Institución cultural Simancas ([[Valladolid]])| isbn = 84-500-3299-7| pages= 83–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman times===
The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] likely came to the Trabancos region in the 2nd century, during the campaigns of [[Lucius Licinius Lucullus (consul 151 BC)|Lucius Licinius Lucullus]] (152 BC), but the area was peripheral to the regions of principal occupation, as well as to the creation of early towns and more importantly, [[trade routes]]: most travel routes were in the east of this region, which followed the river Eresma from the town of Coca (''Cauca'', in Roman times) and Matapozuelos village (''Nivaria'' in Roman times), up to [[Simancas]] (''Septimanca''); and at the west, for the "[[Roman road#Spain|Vía de la Plata]]" ("[[silver]] road"), the most important Roman route in [[Lusitania]] Province. Nevertheless, it is known that in the Vallisoletan area, there was several villages that probably are of pre-Roman origin. In fact, the [[etymology]] of the word 'Trabancos' suggests a name originating before the Roman occupation.

At the ''Lavachicha'' site (municipality of Castrejón, [[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]]) several pieces of typical Roman pottery named [[Samian ware|terra sigillata hispanica]] have been unearthed and there was also an archaeological excavation in the 1980s that revealed a [[necropolis]] from [[Late Antiquity|late Roman times]] or, perhaps, from [[Visigoth]]ic times. Similar remains of late Roman pottery, have been found in Carpio ([[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]]), but only at ground level, and not from archaeological excavation. Another municipality crossed by the Trabancos River is Nava del Rey (a small town located in [[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]]), where, once again, are found superficial pieces of [[Samian ware|terra sigillata hispanica]] and a striking plate fragment with red gloss, resembling those that were carried by [[Legionary|Roman legionaries]] on [[military campaign]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Mañanes, Tomás| title = Arqueología Vallisoletana (I): La Tierra de Campos y el Sur del Duero.| year = 1979| publisher = Institución cultural Simancas ([[Valladolid]])| isbn = 84-500-3299-7| pages= 72–73 and 82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Middle Ages===
In the [[Middle Ages]], the area remained a zone of little interest. No written documents exist prior to the 12th century that mention the region. It is known, however, that between 711 and 740 AD the [[Berber people|Berbers]] had stationed troops in the valley of the [[Duero]], but the majority of these peoples left the area because of a severe [[drought]] that occurred sometime between 750 and 753 AD. Only the most important centers of habitation survived ([[Medina del Campo]], Olmedo, [[Alcazarén]], [[Tordesillas]], etc.).

During the [[Reconquista|Christian conquest]], little emphasis was placed on resettling the region, as it was essential for the sovereigns of the time to consolidate more strategic zones (in the 11th century, priority was placed on the south of the [[Sistema Central]], a mountain range located in the center of the [[Iberian peninsula]]), which is why [[Medina del Campo]] remained intact into the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Villar García |author2=Luis Miguel | title = La Extremadura Castellano-Leonesa: guerreros, clérigos y campesinos| year = 1986| publisher = [http://www.jcyl.es/ Junta de Castilla y León] ([[Valladolid]])| isbn = 84-505-3723-1|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Tomas Mañanes, a professor at the [[University of Valladolid]], who investigated the Trabancos valley and Guareña area, found numerous defensive [[turret]]s or "Torrejones" (according to the local [[dialect]]) that were dated to the 11th century; that is to say, previous to any official resettlement. Specifically, more than ten defensive structures of various sizes were verified along the course of the Trabancos River in the province of Valladolid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Mañanes, T. y Valbuena, F| title = Torres y fortalezas medievales al sur del Duero en la provincia de Valladolid.| year = 1977| publisher = Boletín del seminario de Arte y Arqueología| volume = XLIII| pages= 111–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fortalezas del Trabancos.gif|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Map showing distribution of medieval forts in the border region between the Kingdoms of Castile and León in the 12th century&lt;/center&gt;]]

====Character and purpose of the Torrejones====
Almost all the torrejones are in areas now uninhabited (except those in Castrejón and Alaejos, both of which were turned into castles, in later history). The torrejones were relatively simple [[square (geometry)|square]] or [[egg-shaped]] structures, with several floors, built of [[limestone]] or [[brick]]. At least two categories of torrejones can be identified: The first have small peepholes in their walls and are built in regions that were in isolated areas at the time of use, and the other are small castles located in what were rural farming villages (though today they are [[Deserted medieval village|deserted]]).

Nevertheless, the typological similarity of the structures and the relatively short distance between them (ideal for visual communication), has led some to think that they were on opposite sides of the frontier line between the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of León|León]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] (in [[Salamanca]] there is a town names ''Zorita de la Frontera'' ("Zorita on the Border") in memory of those times). These [[fortress]]es were reinforced in the 12th and 13th centuries due to conflicts between the two kingdoms; but it appears that they are more plentiful on the [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian]] side (near the Trabancos) than on the Leonese side (near the River Guareña). This has been seen as indicative of a certain independence on the part of the militia of the Community of Medina del Campo and surrounding areas, which was thereby forced to defend itself without outside help, while the Leonese side would have been able to rely on the help of [[Monarchy|Royal]] troops, and the [[Knights Hospitaller]] of the ''Order of Saint John of Jerusalem'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Ruiz Asencio, J.M.| title = Medina del Campo en la Alta Edad Media| year = 1986| publisher = Historia de Medina del Campo y su tierra| volume = I| isbn = 84-505-4412-2| pages =  150}}&lt;/ref&gt; billeted in Castronuño and Torrecilla de la Orden.&lt;ref&gt;In old Spanish, both, ''Torrecilla'' and ''Castro-Nuño'' were referred to different sorts of fortress: ''Castro-'' was a [[fortification|stronghold]] founded by a knight named Nuño; and ''Torrecilla'' was a [[keep]]. Consequently, the name  ''Torrecilla de la Orden'' is referred to a keep that belonged to a [[Military order (society)|military order]], specifically to the [[Knights of St John|Order of the Hospital of St. John]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trabancos River area becomes strategically important====
As indicated at the start of the discussion of the area during the [[Middle Ages]], despite its history as a fortified border from the tenth century, the area was unimportant until the thirteenth. The King of the (now united) Kingdom of Castile and Leon, [[Alphonso VII of Castile|Alphonse VII]] (1126–1157), made a series of internal territorial changes that transferred Leonese territories to the Crown of Castille: specifically, The Tierra de Campos to the north of the Duero, an area valued at the time for its riches, and the ''alfoz de Medina del Campo'' (to the south of the Duero), a poor and sparsely populated zone, although it possessed a certain strategic value in terms of the defense of the passes of the Duero valley. During the time of the union of the two crowns, the question of who owned these areas was of little importance; however, upon the death of Alphonse VII and the division of his possession amongst his sons, continuous conflicts arose over the control of the area, especially ''Tierra de Campos'', but also, though less importantly, over the area of [[Medina del Campo]].

The wars over the area intensified between 1178 and 1181. The Leonese ''Alfoz de Toro'' was heavily defended, thanks to the Fortress of [[List of municipalities in Valladolid|Castronuño]], with a vicious battle taking place even on the shores of the Trabancos River itself. Of particular note is an encounter in 1179 between Leonese and Castilian forces, just outside the Fortress of ''Cast'cam'' (Castrejón), which led to the signing of a [[peace treaty]] between Alphonse VIII of Castille and [[Ferdinand II of León]]. But in fact peace came to a swift end in the year 1183, when the Kings of Castille and Leon made camp on the outskirts of the towns of [[Carpio, Valladolid|Carpio]] and Fresno el Viejo (both towns in the Province of Valladolid) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Ruiz Asencio, J.M.| title = Medina del Campo en la Alta Edad Media| year = 1986| publisher = Historia de Medina del Campo y su tierra| volume = I| isbn = 84-505-4412-2| pages =  148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Ferdinand II, fighting resumed (interspersed with a short truce in 1204 thanks to the marriage of [[Alfonso IX of León|Alphonse IX]] of León to his niece, Berenguela of Castile); but the marriage was annulled by her father because of the close [[consanguinity|blood-relationship]] of the spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Martín |author2=José Luis | title = La Península en la Edad Media| year = 1984| publisher = [http://www.editorialteide.es/ Editorial Teide] ([[Barcelona]])| isbn = 84-307-7346-0| pages= 360–362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the Crowns of both kingdoms were taken by [[Ferdinand III of Castile|King Ferdinand III of Castile]].

The logical conclusion of these events was that the border was heavily militarized, involving the building of castles and reinforcements of troops in the areas surrounding the Trabancos River, with some [[castle]]s being erected in the west, such as in Alaejos. Paradoxically, the wars increased the value of the region, and for the first time there began to appear documents recording the area in the files of the [[cathedral]]s of [[Zamora (Spain)|Zamora]], [[Salamanca]] and [[Segovia]] including documents regarding: ''Siete Iglesias de Trabancos'' ("Seven Churches at Trabancos") in 1178, Alaejos (''Falafeios'') in 1167, and in 1180, ''Eván de Arriba, Eván de Abajo, Valdefuentes'' and ''Pedroso'' (which are now [[Deserted medieval village|deserted villages]]), together with ''Nava del Rey'' in 1265, among others.

This last date, 1265, corresponds to a document found in the 'Book of Loans' of Salamanca cathedral,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Martin Martín, J.L.; Villar García, L.M.; Marcos Rodríguez, F y Sánchez Rodríguez, M: |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Documentos del archivo catedralicio y diocesano de Salamanca (siglos XI y XII)| year = 1977| publisher = [http://www.usal.es/ Universidad de Salamanca]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which records the result of a new conflict: the battle between the [[dioceses]] of Salamanca and Segovia for the possession of the [[parishes]] to the east of the Trabancos; an area that hitherto had been accorded little worth. Salamanca had made use of the [[frontier]] struggles to take possession of the towns of Medina del Campo, provoking a conflict of interest since the region was under [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] rule, and Salamanca belonged to the crown of León. In fact, the Salmantinos created new parishes, like ''Siete Iglesias de Trabancos'' in 1167, and Alaejos in 1185.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Martín |author2=José Luis | title = Historia de Castilla y León, vol IV: La afirmación de los Reinos (siglos XI-XIII)| year = 1985| publisher= Ámbito ediciones, www.ambitoediciones.com ([[Valladolid]]) |isbn= 84-86047-51-X |location= Barcelona}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trabancos River area today===
Looking at the Trabancos today and at a time when it is dry, it might seem preposterous that at one time it held a position of strategic importance for the [[Medina del Campo|town of Medina del Campo]], and also, for the so-called ''"Extremadura Catellana"'' (the wildest border of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]]). However, the area's archaeological heritage is fast disappearing.

==ZEPA designation==
[[File:ZEPA Tierra de Campinias (CyL).jpg|thumb|250px|left|&lt;center&gt;Map showing the ZEPA SPA designated territory. The red-colored area corresponds to the province of [[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]], and the orange corresponds to [[Salamanca]] and [[Ávila (province)|Ávila]].&lt;/center&gt;]]  
The middle and final course of the river Trabancos has been included in the ''ZEPA'' (Zona Especial de Protección para las Aves &lt;nowiki&gt;[Special Zone for Protection of Birds]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) ''Tierra de Campiñas'' (''"Land of champaigns"''; [[Special Protection Area]] ("SPA")).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Sanz-Zuasti, Joaquín; Arranz Sanz, José Ángel; Molina García, Ignacio y Sánchez, Carlos |lastauthoramp=yes | title = La red de zonas de especial protección para las aves (ZEPA) de Castilla y León|  year = 2004| publisher = [http://wwwnayade.es Náyade Producciones] para la [http://www.jcyl.es Junta de Castilla y León]| isbn = 84-9718-227-8| pages= 308–313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ZEPA SPAs, are catalogued by the [[List of European Union member states|member states]] of the [[European Union]] as natural zones of special interest for the [[Conservation status|conservation]] of bird species threatened with extinction, in accordance with the criteria established by the community board [https://web.archive.org/web/20060410100947/http://europa.eu.int/comm/images/language/lang_en3.gif Birds Directive 79/409/CEE] and subsequent modifications by the (Directiva de Aves) ''"Aviary Regulation Board"'' of the EU.

Although the designation also includes a portion of the Guareña River's course to the west, and the Zapardiel River's course to the east, the Trabancos River ZEPA SPA designated area is the largest in the [[Castile-Leon|Autonomous Community of Castile and León]], since it covers almost 1,400 square kilometres, including the Campo de Peñaranda (in [[Salamanca]]), the Moraña (in Ávila) and, especially, a large part of the Tierra de [[Medina del Campo]]. In all, 73% of the territory of the Trabancos ZEPA SPA corresponds to the province of Valladolid.

The designated region is largely uninhabited —97% of the area is agricultural land, with an emphasis on [[cereal crops]] and other  [[Irrigation|irrigation farming]] purposes. The areas of ecological interest are found in the remaining 3% percent of the terrain. The region is characterized by tilled land and pastures, small [[pine]] [[Forest|woods]] and [[holm oak]] [[Forest|woods]], with interspersed wasteland areas covered in [[halophile]] bushes. There are also many small [[ephemeral]] ponds; a characteristic of Spanish [[steppe]]s, which are only water-filled during the winter. From a conservation standpoint, such ponds, like nearby segments of the Trabancos River's banks, are in a precarious [[ecological]] state. Nevertheless, the areas are still capable of sustaining the [[flora]] and [[faun]]a commensurate with a natural riverside environment.

The Trabancos region stands out for its concentration of [[great bustard]]s (more than 2000); as well as having the largest reproductive concentration of [[black-bellied sandgrouse]]s (''Pterocles orientalis'') in Castile and León (with more than 200 mating pairs). It is also the winter season nesting ground of more than 1,500 [[red kite]]s (''Milvus milvus''). There are also numerous [[bird of prey|birds of prey]]; the most abundant are [[Montagu's harrier]]s (''Circus pygargus'', 50 mating pairs) and [[lesser kestrel]]s (''Falco naumanni''; almost 150 mating pairs), but there are also [[hawk]]s, [[northern goshawk|goshawk]]s, [[falcon]]s, [[owl]]s, and others. The region is also host to numerous [[Game (food)|gamebirds]], including the [[red-legged partridge]] (''Alectoris rufa'').

Despite their importance, the population of [[little bustard]] (''Tetrax tetrax'') in the region appear to be diminishing. Although not all the species protected in this ZEPA SPA can be listed, the protected area is a migratory crossing site and wintertime nesting area that, along with the Riberas de Castronuño (Valladolid) nature reserve, is frequented by many waterfowl ([[Crane (bird)|cranes]], [[geese]], etc.), some of which even take advantage of the area [[ephemeral]] ponds for nesting during humid winters.

[[File:Yaacov Oved.jpg|250px|thumb|Yaacov Oved, 2014]]
'''Yaacov Oved''' (born 19 February 1929) is a [[historian]] and Professor Emeritus in the Department of History at [[Tel Aviv University]], member of [[Kibbutz]] Palmachim, research fellow at Yad Tabenkin: the institute of research and documentation of the [[kibbutz movement]], researcher of the history of communes in the world and co- founder of the International Communal Studies Association.

== Biography ==
Yaacov Varsano-Oved was born on 19 February 1929 in Haskovo, Bulgaria. When he was eight years old, he immigrated to Israel with his parents, Ovadia and Bella Varsano and brother Eliyahu. The family resided in Tel Aviv. Yaacov went to Echad Haam School and Gymnasia Herzliya High School and joined the Scouts youth  movement. In 1946 he enlisted in the "Hagana" organization and was a member of the Palmach unit and was assigned by it to be a leader in the Scouts Movement in 1947. In 1949 he was part of a Palmach core-group that established Kibbutz Palmachim. In 1941-1954 he was sent  by Hakibbutz Hameuchad to Argentina to work as educator emissary in the youth movement "Hanoar Hechalutz  iBorochovy Hakibbutz Hameuchad". In 1951, he married Tehila Kiriaty and the couple made their home in Palmachim, where their son and three daughters were born and educated. In 1954-1959 he worked in agriculture on the kibbutz, and from 1959 to 1961 he studied in the  two-year higher education course in the Hakibbutz Hameuchad Seminar  at Efal. Later he began teaching at the high school in kibbutz Palmachim. In 1967 he set out on a brief mission to Argentina. On this occasion he changed his surname to the Hebrew name Oved.

In the 1950s he published several articles about Latin American affairs in Israeli journals. In 1958, in one of the articles about Cuba, he predicted that Fidel Castro would overthrow the dictatorship  of Batista and start a Socialist revolution.  In 1960 he joined the Israel-Cuba Friendship League and in 1964 was part of the League's delegation to Cuba. In the course of his visit he witnessed several facets of the regime that he did not regard favorably, and after the visit he left the League.

In 1959-1961 he studied in the Higher Education Course of social sciences run by Hakibbutz Hameuchad in Efal. Later he became a teacher  at the Kibbutz Palmachim High School. In 1969 he started  to study at the Departments of History  and Philosophy at Tel Aviv University and graduated with "Summa cum Laude". In 1971, he started his PhD at Oxford University. His dissertation was on Anarchism and the Workers’ Movement in Argentina in the Early Twentieth Century. It was supervised  by Professor Michael Confino of Tel Aviv University and Professor Ezequiel Gallo of the University of Buenos Aires.

After his thesis was approved in 1975 by the Senate of Tel Aviv University, Oved was appointed as a lecturer in the Tel Aviv University's Department of History.
At the same time he  joined Yad Tabenkin, the Institute for Study and Documentation of the Kibbutz Movement, as a teacher and research associate. It was in this institute that he began to study the history of communes  around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=2f850076-4969-43ec-b7fb-1ca9fd18f932%40sessionmgr4004&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=128 Yaacov Oved, Communities Directory: A Guide to Cooperative Living (Book Review). Utopian Studies. 1997, Vol. 8 Issue 1, p154. 2p.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, while on  a research  journey to investigate communes' archives  in the United States, he participated in a conference of the American National Historic Communal Studies Association in Omaha Nebraska. In the meeting with the association's  president, Donald E Pitzer, he raised the idea of holding an international conference  of commune and kibbutz researchers in Israel. Yad Tabenkin undertook the initiative and  in 1985, under its auspices, the first international conference of kibbutz and commune scholars took place. At the end of the conference, the International Communal Studies Association was founded. Prof. Oved elected to serve as its Executive Director, a position which he continued to fill until 2004. Since its founding, the association has held 11 tri-annual international conferences in different universities and commune venues around the world. During that period, Yaacov Oved served as the acting chairman of the association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yadtabenkin.org.il/eng/ YadTabenkin website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Yaacov Oved was nominated full professor at Tel Aviv University, retiring in 1998. During the years that followed, he was dedicated  to the Yad Tabenkin Communes Department. In this framework he cultivated relations with commune researchers from around the world and with many communes including the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]] communes in the USA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ic.org/directory/bruderhof/|title=Bruderhof - Fellowship for Intentional Community|work=Fellowship for Intentional Community|access-date=2017-05-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Findhorn in Scotland, Damanur in Italy, Zegg in Germany, Riverside in New Zealand, Twin Oaks in the USA and others. These relationships deepened  the  ties between the Kibbutz Movement and the world communes. Prof. Oved was devoted also to enlarging the Yad Tabenkin scientific  library on communes, whose collection on communes and kibbutz publications has earned a high reputation among scholars of  these fields.&lt;ref&gt;Dalia Halperin, “Communes: Yaacov Oved’s Tours of Communes”, Maariv, 21 May 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific activities ==
Yaacov Oved’s  PhD  thesis on anarchism in the Argentine labor movement in the early 20th century was published as a book in Spanish in 1978 by Siglo XXI Publishing and an extended second edition was printed in 2013 by Imago Mundi, Buenos Aires.

In 1986, Yaacov Oved published his comprehensive book Two Hundred Years of American Communes, and subsequently published additional books on contemporary communes. In addition to his books about communes, Prof. Oved has published books and articles about anarchism, utopian anarcho-communist philosophy and anarchistic communes in the Spanish Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Avner Ben Ner, "Home of the Free and the Collective", in: Foundation News, September 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, he published an article about independent kibbutz high education that reviews the history of the Efal high education courses in which Yaacov Oved was both a student and a teacher.

'''Yele Sambat''' (Devanagari: येले संबत् ) is the [[lunar calendar]] used by the [[Kirat]] community of [[Nepal]]. The Yele Sambat calendar is named after the first Kirat king [[Yalambar]]. The [[Limbu]]s call it ''Yele Tangbe'', the [[Rai people|Rais]] call it ''Yele Dong'', and the [[Sunuwar]]s call it ''Yele Thoche''.

On 15 November 2009, [[Subash Chandra Nembang]], Chairperson of the Constituent Assembly (CA) stressed the need for the Government of Nepal to recognize Kirant Yele Sambat and ensure that it would be included in the constitution as annex. On 15 January 2010, the Government of Nepal stated that it would formally recognise Yele Sambat. It is said that this calendar started when the Kirat king [[Yalambar]] defeated the Gopal dynasty in the [[Kathmandu Valley]]. The Yele Sambat calendar begins on 15 January. This new year day is also celebrated as [[Maghe Sankranti]] in Nepal when people eat sweet potato and various kinds of [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]s and [[sel roti]].

==History==
According to ''Gopal Vamsawali'', 32 Kirat kings ruled the Kathmandu valley for 1963 years and 8 months (see: किरात येले संवत अभिलेख, किरात येले संवत अध्ययन समन्वय समिति, २०१०, पृष्ठ १३ र पृष्ठ २२७ को प्याराग्राफ १). The Kirat rule ended and the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavi]] rule was started by Jaya Varma in [[Shaka era|Saka Sambat]] 107. 78 years of time period is added to convert Saka Sambat into [[Anno Domini|AD]], i.e., Saka Sambat 107 + 78 years = 185 AD. The Kirat kings ruled for 1963 years and 8 months. Deducting 185 from 1963 years and 8 months = 1779.8 AD, which is the starting ruling year of the first Kirat king Yalambar. In 2018, adding 1779.8 AD and 2017 AD, the Yele Sambat year comes out to be 3797 years and 8 months.

'''Young Vienna''' (''Jung-Wien'') was a society of ''[[fin de siècle]]'' writers who met in Vienna's [[Café Griensteidl]] and other nearby coffeehouses in the late nineteenth century. &lt;ref name="Schorske"/&gt;

The group turned away from the prevailing [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] of the time and experimented with various facets of [[Modernism]], including [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Impressionism (literature)|Impressionism]].  In his review of turn of the century Vienna, historian [[Carl Schorske]] wrote of the movement that they "challenged the moralistic stance of nineteenth century literature in favor of sociological truth and psychological - especially sexual - openness."&lt;ref name="Schorske"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl E. Schorske|title=Fin-De-Siecle Vienna: Politics and Culture|year=1981|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-394-74478-0|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hermann Bahr]] was considered the group's spokesman. Other members included [[Arthur Schnitzler]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Felix Dörmann|de}}, [[Peter Altenberg]],  [[Richard Beer-Hofmann]], [[Felix Salten]], [[Raoul Auernheimer]],  [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]], and [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]].&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gabrielle H.

After the café's demolition the group (sans Kraus) continued to meet at the nearby Café Central. &lt;ref name="RoughGuide"&gt;{{cite book|last=Humphries|first=Rob|title=The Rough Guide to Vienna|year=2001|publisher=Rough Guides, ltd|location=London|isbn=978-1-85828-725-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
