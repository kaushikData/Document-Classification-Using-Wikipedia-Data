'''Aleksei Aleksandrovich Gubarev''' ({{lang-ru|Алексе́й Алекса́ндрович Гу́барев}}; 29 March 1931 – 21 February 2015) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[astronaut|cosmonaut]] who flew on two [[manned space mission|space flights]]: [[Soyuz 17]] and [[Soyuz 28]].

== Biography ==
Gubarev graduated from the [[Soviet Naval Aviation School]] in 1952 and went on to serve with the [[Soviet Air Force]]. He undertook further studies at the [[Gagarin Air Force Academy]] before being accepted into the space programme.

He was originally trained for the Soviet lunar programme and for military [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz]] flights before training for [[Salyut]] missions. His next mission, in 1978, was Soyuz 28, the first [[Interkosmos]] flight, where he was accompanied by [[Vladimír Remek]] from [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/cosmonauts/english/gubarev_aleksei.htm Biographies of USSR / Russian Cosmonauts: Gubarev]. Spacefacts.de&lt;/ref&gt;

He resigned as a cosmonaut in 1981 and took up an administrative position at the [[Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre]].

In the 1980s he worked at the [[30th Central Scientific Research Institute, Ministry of Defence (Russia)]].

His awards includes the [[Gagarin Gold Medal]], which was bestowed upon him twice.   He was an honorary citizen of [[Kaluga]], [[Arkalyk]], [[Tselinograd]], and [[Prague]].

Gubarev published a book, ''The Attraction of Weightlessness'', in 1982.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27808">The '''Allee effect''' is a phenomenon in [[biology]] characterized by a correlation between [[population size]] or density and the mean individual [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] (often measured as ''[[per capita]]'' [[population growth rate]]) of a population or species.&lt;ref name=book1&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Courchamp F, Berec J, Gascoigne J |year=2008 |title=Allee effects in ecology and conservation |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, New York, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background==
{{Main|Warder Clyde Allee}}

Although the concept of Allee effect had no title at the time, it was first described in the 1930s by its namesake, [[Warder Clyde Allee]]. Through experimental studies, Allee was able to demonstrate that goldfish grow more rapidly when there are more individuals within the tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Allee WC, Bowen E |year=1932 |title=Studies in animal aggregations: mass protection against colloidal silver among goldfishes |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology |volume=61 |pages=185–207 |doi=10.1002/jez.1400610202 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led him to conclude that aggregation can improve the survival rate of individuals, and that cooperation may be crucial in the overall evolution of social structure. The term "Allee principle" was introduced in the 1950s, a time when the field of ecology was heavily focused on the role of competition among and within species.&lt;ref name=book1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author =Odum EP |year=1953 |title=Fundamentals of Ecology |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical view of population dynamics stated that due to competition for resources, a population will experience a reduced overall growth rate at higher density and increased growth rate at lower density. In other words, individuals in a population would be better off when there are fewer individuals around due to a limited amount of resources (see [[Logistic function#In ecology: modeling population growth|logistic growth]]). However, the concept of the Allee effect introduced the idea that the reverse holds true when the population density is low. Individuals within a species often require the assistance of another individual for more than simple reproductive reasons in order to persist. The most obvious example of this is observed in animals that hunt for prey or defend against predators as a group.

==Definition==

The generally accepted definition of Allee effect is positive density dependence, or the positive correlation between population density and individual fitness. It is sometimes referred to as "undercrowding" and it is analogous (or even considered synonymous by some) to "[[depensation]]" in the field of [[fishery science]]s.&lt;ref name=book1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Stephens PA, Sutherland WJ, Freckleton RP |year=1999 |title=What is the Allee effect? |journal=Oikos |volume=87 |pages=185–190 |doi=10.2307/3547011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Listed below are a few significant subcategories of the Allee effect used in the ecology literature.

===Component vs. demographic Allee effects===
The '''component Allee effect''' is the positive relationship between any measurable component of individual fitness and population density. The '''demographic Allee effect''' is the positive relationship between the overall individual fitness and population density.

The distinction between the two terms lies on the scale of the Allee effect: the presence of a demographic Allee effect suggests the presence of at least one component Allee effect, while the presence of a component Allee effect does not necessarily result in a demographic Allee effect. For example, cooperative hunting and the ability to more easily find mates, both influenced by population density, are component Allee effects, as they influence individual fitness of the population. At low population density, these component Allee effects would add up to produce an overall demographic Allee effect (increased fitness with higher population density). When population density reaches a high number, negative density dependence often offsets the component Allee effects through resource competition, thus erasing the demographic Allee effect.&lt;ref name=kramer&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Kramer AM, Dennis B, Liebhold AM, Drake JM |year=2009 |title=The evidence for Allee effects |journal=Population Ecology |volume=51 |pages=341–354 |doi=10.1007/s10144-009-0152-6 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that Allee effects might occur even at high population density for some species.&lt;ref name=book1 /&gt;

===Strong vs. weak Allee effects===
[[File:A graph showing the difference between strong and weak Allee effects.svg|thumb|right|Allee effects are classified by the nature of density dependence at low densities. If the population shrinks for low densities, there is a strong Allee effect. If the proliferation rate is positive and increasing then there is a weak Allee effect. The null hypothesis is that proliferation rates are positive but decreasing at low densities.]]

The '''strong Allee effect''' is a demographic Allee effect with a critical population size or density. The '''weak Allee effect''' is a demographic Allee effect without a critical population size or density.

The distinction between the two terms is based on whether or not the population in question exhibits a [[extinction threshold|critical population size or density]]. A population exhibiting a weak Allee effect will possess a reduced per capita growth rate (directly related to individual fitness of the population) at lower population density or size. However, even at this low population size or density, the population will always exhibit a positive per capita growth rate. Meanwhile, a population exhibiting a strong Allee effect will have a critical population size or density under which the population growth rate becomes negative. Therefore, when the population density or size hits a number below this threshold, the population will be destined for extinction without any further aid. A strong Allee effect is often easier to demonstrate empirically using time series data, as one can pinpoint the population size or density at which per capita growth rate becomes negative.&lt;ref name=book1 /&gt;

==Mechanisms==

Due to its definition as the positive correlation between population density and average fitness, the mechanisms for which an Allee effect arises are therefore inherently tied to survival and reproduction. In general, these Allee effect mechanisms arise from cooperation or facilitation among individuals in the species. Examples of such cooperative behaviors include better mate finding, environmental conditioning, and group defense against predators. As these mechanisms are more easily observable in the field, they tend to be more commonly associated with the Allee effect concept. Nevertheless, mechanisms of Allee effect that are less conspicuous such as [[inbreeding depression]] and [[sex ratio]] bias should be considered as well.

===Ecological mechanism===
Although numerous ecological mechanisms for Allee effects exist, the list of most commonly cited facilitative behaviors that contribute to Allee effects in the literature include: mate limitation, cooperative defense, cooperative feeding, and environmental conditioning.&lt;ref name=kramer /&gt; While these behaviors are classified in separate categories, note that they can overlap and tend to be context dependent (will operate only under certain conditions – for example, cooperative defense will only be useful when there are predators or competitors present).

;Mate limitation: Mate limitation refers to the difficulty of finding a compatible and receptive mate for sexual reproduction at lower population size or density. This is generally a problem encountered by species that utilize passive reproduction and possess low mobility, such as [[plankton]], plants and sessile invertebrates.&lt;ref name="Berec L 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Berec L, Angulo E, Courchamp F |year=2007 |title=Multiple Allee effects and population management |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=22 |pages=185–191 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2006.12.002 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, wind-pollinated plants would have a lower fitness in sparse populations due to the lower likelihood of pollen successfully landing on a conspecific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Davis HG, Taylor CM, Lambrinos JG, Strong DR |year=2004 |title=Pollen limitation causes an Allee effect in a wind-pollinated invasive grass (''Spartina alterniflora'') |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=101 |pages=13804–13807 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0405230101 |issue=38|bibcode = 2004PNAS..10113804D |pmid=15317944 |pmc=518837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Cooperative defense: Another possible benefit of aggregation is to protect against predation by group anti-predator behavior. Many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, thus reducing the fitness of an individual living in smaller groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Mooring MS, Fitzpatrick TA, Nishihira TT, Reisig DD |year=2004 |title=Vigilance, predation risk, and the Allee effect in desert bighorn sheep |journal=Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=68 |pages=519–532 |doi=10.2193/0022-541X(2004)068[0519:VPRATA]2.0.CO;2 |editor1-last=Hall |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One striking example of such shared vigilance is exhibited by [[meerkat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Clutton-Brock TH, Gaynor D, McIlrath GM, MacColl AD, Kansky R, Chadwick P, Manser M, Skinner JD, Brotherton PN |year=1999 |title=Predation, group size and mortality in a cooperative mongoose, ''Suricata suricatta'' |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |volume=68 |pages=672–683 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2656.1999.00317.x |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, other species move in synchrony to confuse and avoid predators such as schools of [[sardines]] and flocks of [[starlings]]. The confusion effect that this herding behavior would have on predators will be more effective when more individuals are present.&lt;ref name=book1 /&gt;

;Cooperative feeding: Certain species also require group foraging in order to survive. As an example, species that hunt in packs, such as the [[African wild dog]]s, would not be able to locate and capture prey as efficiently in smaller groups.&lt;ref name="Berec L 2006"/&gt;

;Environmental conditioning / habitat alteration: Environmental conditioning generally refers to the mechanism in which individuals work together in order to improve their immediate or future environment for the benefit of the species. This alteration could involve changes in both abiotic (temperature, turbulence, etc.) or biotic (toxins, hormones, etc.) environmental factors. [[Pacific salmon]] present a potential case of such component Allee effects, where the density of spawning individuals can affect the survivability of the following generations. Spawning salmon carry marine nutrients they acquired from the ocean as they migrate to freshwater streams to reproduce, which in turn fertilize the surrounding habitat when they die, thus creating a more suitable habitat for the juveniles that would hatch in the following months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Rinella DJ, Wipfli MS, Stricker CA, Heintz RA, Rinella MJ |year=2012 |title=Pacific salmon (''Oncorhynchus'' spp.) runs and consumer fitness: growth and energy storage in stream-dwelling salmonids increase with salmon spawner density |journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences |volume=69 |pages=73–84 |doi=10.1139/f2011-133}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While compelling, this case of environmental conditioning by salmon has not been rigorously supported by empirical evidence.

=== Human induced ===
Classic economic theory predicts that human exploitation of a population is unlikely to result in species extinction because the escalating costs to find the last few individuals will exceed the fixed price one achieves by selling the individuals on the market. However, when rare species are more desirable than common species, prices for rare species can exceed high harvest costs. This phenomenon can create an "anthropogenic" Allee effect where rare species go extinct but common species are sustainably harvested.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Courchamp|first=Franck|last2=Angulo|first2=Elena|last3=Rivalan|first3=Philippe|last4=Hall|first4=Richard J.|last5=Signoret|first5=Laetitia|last6=Bull|first6=Leigh|last7=Meinard|first7=Yves|date=2006-11-28|title=Rarity Value and Species Extinction: The Anthropogenic Allee Effect|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040415|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=4|issue=12|pages=e415|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040415|issn=1545-7885}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropogenic Allee effect has become a standard approach for conceptualizing the threat of economic markets on endangered species.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=McDonald-Madden|first2=Eve|date=2017-09-21|title=High prices for rare species can drive large populations extinct: the anthropogenic Allee effect revisited|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519317302916|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=429|pages=170–180|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.06.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the original theory was posited using a one dimensional analysis of a two dimensional model.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  It turns out that a two dimensional analysis yields an Allee curve in human exploiter and biological population space and that this curve separating species destined to extinction vs persistence can be complicated. Even very high population sizes can potentially pass through the originally proposed Allee thresholds on predestined paths to extinction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Genetic mechanisms ===
Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to [[genetic diversity|genetic variation]]'s role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this [[population bottleneck|genetic bottleneck]] is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of [[genetic drift]], as well as [[inbreeding depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author =Frankham R |year=1996 |title=Relationship of genetic variation to population size in wildlife- a review |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=10 |pages=1500–1508 |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1996.10061500.x |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of [[Mutation#Harmful mutations|deleterious mutations]] throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed ([[genetic drift]]). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.&lt;ref name=book1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author =Gillespie JH |year=2004 |title=Population genetics: a concise guide |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore, Maryland, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author =Reed DH |year=2010 |title=Albatrosses, eagles and newts, Oh My!: exceptions to the prevailing paradigm concerning genetic diversity and population viability? |journal=Animal Conservation |volume=13 |pages=448–457 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-1795.2010.00353.x |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such case was observed in the endangered [[Florida panther]] (''Puma concolor coryi''). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ~ 25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |year=2010 |title=Genetic restoration of the Florida panther |journal=Science |volume=329 |pages=1641–1645 |bibcode=2010Sci...329.1641J |last1=Johnson|first1=WE|last2=Onorato |first2=DP|last3=Roelke |first3=MW|last4=Land |first4=ED|last5=Cunningham |first5=M|last6=Belden |first6=RC|last7=McBride |first7=R|last8=Jansen |first8=D|last9=Lotz |first9=M|displayauthors=8|doi=10.1126/science.1192891 |pmid=20929847 |issue=5999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led to the reduction in the prevalence of the defects previously associated with inbreeding depression. Although the timescale for this inbreeding depression is larger than of those more immediate Allee effects, it has significant implications on the long-term persistence of a species.

===Demographic stochasticity===
Demographic stochasticity refers to variability in population growth arising from sampling random births and deaths in a population of finite size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198525257.003.0001|title=Demographic and environmental stochasticity|last=Lande|first=Russell|last2=Engen|first2=Steinar|last3=SÆther|first3=Bernt-Erik|pages=1–24|language=en|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198525257.003.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In small populations, demographic stochasticity will decrease the population growth rate, causing an effect similar to the Allee effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lande R | year = 1998 | title = Demographic stochasticity and Allee effect on a scale with isotropic noise | url = | journal = Oikos | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 353–358 | doi=10.2307/3546849}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will increase the risk of population extinction. Whether or not demographic stochasticity can be considered a part of Allee effect is somewhat contentious however. The most current definition of Allee effect considers the correlation between population density and mean individual fitness. Therefore, random variation resulting from birth and death events would not be considered part of Allee effect as the increased risk of extinction is not a consequence of the changing fates of individuals within the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Bessa-Gomes C, Legendre S, Clobert J |year=2004 |title=Allee effects, mating systems and the extinction risk in populations with two sexes |journal=Ecology Letters |volume=7 |pages=802–812 |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00632.x |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Meanwhile, when demographic stochasticity results in fluctuations of sex ratios, it arguably reduces the mean individual fitness as population declines. For example, a fluctuation in small population that causes a scarcity in one sex would in turn limit the access of mates for the opposite sex, decreasing the fitness of the individuals within the population.

Recent results based on spatio-temporal models show that the Allee effect can also promote genetic diversity in expanding populations.&lt;ref name=Roq12&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Roques L, Garnier J, Hamel F, Klein EK |year=2012 |title=Allee effect promotes diversity in traveling waves of colonization |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA |doi=10.1073/pnas.1201695109 |volume=109 |issue=23 |pages=8828–33 |pmid=22611189 |pmc=3384151|bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.8828R }}&lt;/ref&gt; These results counteract commonly held notions that the Allee effect possesses net adverse consequences. Reducing the growth rate of the individuals ahead of the colonization front simultaneously reduces the speed of colonization and enables a diversity of genes coming from the core of the population to remain on the front. The Allee effect also affects the spatial distribution of diversity. Whereas spatio-temporal models which do not include an Allee effect lead to a vertical pattern of genetic diversity (i.e., a strongly structured spatial distribution of genetic fractions), those including an Allee effect lead to a "horizontal pattern" of genetic diversity (i.e., an absence of genetic differentiation in space).&lt;ref name=Roq12 /&gt;

==Mathematical models==

A simple mathematical example of an Allee effect is given by the cubic growth model
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt} = r N \left( \frac{N}{A} - 1 \right) \left( 1 - \frac{N}{K} \right),&lt;/math&gt;
where the population has a negative growth rate for &lt;math&gt; 0&lt; N &lt; A &lt;/math&gt;, and 
a positive growth rate for &lt;math&gt; A &lt; N &lt; K &lt;/math&gt; (assuming &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; A &lt; K &lt;/math&gt;).
This is a departure from the [[logistic function|logistic growth equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt} = r  N \left( 1- \frac{N}{K} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:N = population size;
:r = [[Population dynamics|intrinsic rate of increase]];
:K = [[carrying capacity]];
:A = critical point; and
:dN/dt = rate of increase of the population.

After dividing both sides of the equation by the population size N, in the logistic growth the left hand side of the equation represents the per capita population growth rate, which is dependent on the population size N, and decreases with increasing N throughout the entire range of population sizes. In contrast, when there is an Allee effect the per-capita growth rate increases with increasing N over some range of population sizes [0, N].&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|pQTNFYPgDdEC|Essentials of Ecology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spatio-temporal models can take Allee effect into account as well. A simple example is given by the reaction-diffusion model
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial N}{\partial t} =D \frac{\partial^2 N}{\partial x^2}+ r N \left( \frac{N}{A} - 1 \right) \left( 1 - \frac{N}{K} \right),&lt;/math&gt;
where
: D=[[diffusion coefficient]]; 
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}&lt;/math&gt; = one-dimensional [[Laplace operator]].

When a population is made up of small sub-populations additional factors to the Allee effect arise.

If the sub-populations are subject to different environmental variations (i.e. separated enough that a disaster could occur at one sub-population site without affecting the other sub-populations) but still allow individuals to travel between sub-populations, then the individual sub-populations are more likely to go extinct than the total population. In the case of a catastrophic event decreasing numbers at a sub-population, individuals from another sub-population site may be able to repopulate the area.

If all sub-populations are subject to the same environmental variations (i.e. if a disaster affected one, it would affect them all) then [[population fragmentation|fragmentation]] of the population is detrimental to the population and increases extinction risk for the total population. In this case, the species receives none of the benefits of a small sub-population (loss of the sub-population is not catastrophic to the species as a whole) and all of the disadvantages ([[inbreeding]] depression, loss of [[genetic diversity]] and increased vulnerability to environmental instability) and the population would survive better unfragmented.&lt;ref name=Gar12 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Minimum viable population size |vauthors=Traill LW, Brook BW, Bradshaw CJ |date=6 March 2010 |work=Ecology Theory |publisher=The Encyclopedia of Earth |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Minimum_viable_population_size |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allee principles of aggregation==

Clumping results due to individuals aggregating in response to: 1) local habitat or landscape differences, 2) daily and seasonal weather changes, 3) reproductive processes, or 4) as the result of social attractions.

Two [[star]]s that lie on the same almucantar have the same [[Altitude (astronomy)|altitude]]. 
[[:wikt:almucantar|The term]] was introduced into [[History of astronomy#Medieval Western Europe|European astronomy]] by [[monk|monastic]] astronomer [[Hermann Contractus]] of [[Reichenau Island|Reichenau]], Latinized from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''{{transl|ar|al-muqanṭarah}}'' ("the almucantar, sundial", plural: ''{{transl|ar|al-muqanṭarāt}}''), derived from ''{{transl|ar|qanṭarah}}'' ("arch, bridge")&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|almucantar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MW&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|almucantar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Almucantar staff==

An '''almucantar staff''' is an instrument chiefly used to determine the time of [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]], in order to find the amplitude and consequently the variations of the [[compass]].  Usually made of [[pear]] tree or [[boxwood]], with an arch of 15° to 30°,&lt;ref name="may"&gt;May, William Edward, ''A History of Marine Navigation'', G. T. Foulis &amp;amp; Co. Ltd., Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, 1973, {{ISBN|0-85429-143-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is an example of a [[backstaff]].
[[Image:Almucantar-staff.png|left|thumb|This is a drawing of an almucantar staff. There are three vanes - the horizon vane (A), the shadow vane (B) and the sighting vane (C).]]
The sun casts that shadow of a vane (B in the adjacent image) on a ''horizon vane'' (A).  The horizon vane has a slit or hole to allow the observer to see the horizon in the distance.  The observer aligns the horizon and shadow so they show at the same point on the horizon vane and sets the ''sighting vane'' (C) to align his line of sight with the horizon.  The altitude of the sun is the angle between the shadow vane and the sighting vane.

==Solar almucantar==
The almucantar plane that contains the Sun is used to characterize multiple [[scattering]] of [[aerosols]]. Measurements are carried out rapidly at several angle at both sides of the Sun using a [[spectroradiometer]] or a [[photometer]]. There are several models to obtain aerosol properties from the solar almucantar. The most relevant were developed by [[Oleg Dubovik]] and used in the NASA [[AERONET]] network and by [[Teruyuki Nakajima]] (named SkyRad.pack).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pen.agbi.tsukuba.ac.jp/~RStiger/hiki2/?Skyrad.pack SkyRad.pack] {{link language|ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bridgman–Stockbarger technique''' is named after Harvard physicist [[Percy Williams Bridgman]] (1882-1961) and MIT physicist [[Donald C. Stockbarger]] (1895–1952).  The technique includes two similar but distinct methods primarily used for growing [[boule (crystal)|boules]] (single crystal ingots), but which can be used for solidifying [[polycrystalline]] ingots as well.

The methods involve heating polycrystalline material above its melting point and slowly cooling it from one end of its container, where a [[seed crystal]] is located.  A single crystal of the same crystallographic orientation as the seed material is grown on the seed and is progressively formed along the length of the container. The process can be carried out in a horizontal or vertical orientation, and usually involves a rotating crucible/ampoule to stir the melt.&lt;ref name="ScheelCapper2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hans J. Scheel|author2=Peter Capper|author3=Peter Rudolph|title=Crystal Growth Technology: Semiconductors and Dielectrics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jq9t9QE0LNwC&amp;pg=PA177|date=25 October 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-3-527-32593-1|pages=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bridgman method is a popular way of producing certain [[semiconductor]] crystals such as [[gallium arsenide]], for which the [[Czochralski process]] is more difficult. The process can reliably produce single crystal ingots, but does not necessarily result in uniform properties through the crystal.&lt;ref name="ScheelCapper2010" /&gt;

Stockbarger's modification of the Bridgman technique allows for better control over the temperature gradient at the melt/crystal interface.

When seed crystals are not employed as described above, polycrystalline ingots can be produced from a feedstock consisting of rods, chunks, or any irregularly shaped pieces once they are melted and allowed to re-solidify.  The resultant [[microstructures|microstructure]]  of the ingots so obtained are characteristic of directionally solidified metals and alloys with their aligned grains.

A variant of the technique known as the '''horizontal directional solidification method''' or '''HDSM''' developed by Khachik Bagdasarov starting in the 1960s in the Soviet Union uses a flat-bottomed crucible with short sidewalls rather than an enclosed ampoule, and has been used to grow various large oxide crystals including [[Yttrium aluminium garnet|Yb:YAG]] (a laser host crystal),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arzakantsyan|first1=M.|last2=Ananyan,|first2=N.|last3=Gevorgyan|first3=V.|last4=Chanteloup|first4=J.-C.|title=Growth of large 90 mm diameter Yb:YAG single crystals with Bagdasarov method|journal=Optical Materials Express|date=2012|volume=2|issue=9|pages=1219–1225}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sapphire]] crystals 45&amp;nbsp;cm wide and over 1 meter long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montgomery|first1=Matthew|last2=Blockburger|first2=Clark|editor1-last=Zelinski|editor1-first=Brian J.|title=18 x 36 x 1.5 inch sapphire panels for visible and infrared windows|journal=Proc.

'''Bulk purchasing''' is the purchase of much larger quantities than the usual, for a [[unit price]] that is lower than the usual.

[[Wholesaling]] is [[selling]] goods in large quantities at a low [[unit price]] to retail merchants. The wholesaler will accept a slightly lower sales price for each unit, if the retailer will agree to purchase a much greater quantity of units, so the wholesaler can maximize profit.  A wholesaler usually represents a factory where goods are produced.  The factory owners can use [[economy of scale]] to increase profit as quantities sold soars.

[[Retailing]] is [[buying]] goods in a wholesale market to sell them in small quantities at higher prices to [[consumers]].  Part of this profit is justified by [[logistics]], the useful distribution function of the retailer, who delivers the goods to consumers and divides those large quantities of goods into many smaller units suitable for many transactions with many small parties of consumers.  Retailers can also benefit from [[economy of scale]] to increase profit, just like a wholesaler does.

'''Bulk purchasing''' is when a consumer captures part of the benefits of [[economy of scale]] by doing with the retailer what the retailer does with the wholesaler: paying a lower price per unit in exchange for purchasing much larger quantities.  This allows the consumer to satisfy more of his or her demands at a lower total cost by acquiring more [[use value]] per dollar spent.

Consumer demand for savings by bulk purchase has led to the success of [[big-box store]]s. Although effected by [[marginal cost]], the total cost does not increase.

==In popular culture==
In the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch ''The [[Coneheads]]'', the Coneheads engage in bulk purchasing and then "consume mass quantities".

'''Cabalzarite''' is a rare [[arsenate mineral]] with formula: (Ca(Mg,Al,Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[AsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·2(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O,OH). It is a member of the [[tsumcorite]] group. It crystallizes in the [[monoclinic]] system and typically occurs as clusters of crystals or granular aggregates.&lt;ref name=Webmin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

It was first described for samples from an abandoned [[manganese]] mine in Falotta, [[Graubünden]], [[Switzerland]] and named for Swiss amateur mineralogist Walter Cabalzar. It was approved as a new mineral by the [[International Mineralogical Association|IMA]] in 1997. It has also been reported from the Aghbar mine in [[Ouarzazate Province]], [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

A '''cervical fracture''', commonly called a '''broken neck''', is a catastrophic [[fracture]] of any of the seven [[cervical vertebrae]] in the [[neck]]. Examples of common causes in humans are traffic collisions and diving into shallow water. Abnormal movement of neck bones or pieces of bone can cause a [[spinal cord injury]] resulting in loss of sensation, [[paralysis]], or usually instant death.

==Causes==
Considerable force is needed to cause a cervical fracture. Vehicle collisions and falls are common causes.  A severe, sudden twist to the neck or a severe blow to the head or neck area can cause a cervical fracture.

Sports that involve violent physical contact carry a risk of cervical fracture, including [[American football]], [[association football]] (especially the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]), [[ice hockey]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], and [[wrestling]]. Spearing an opponent in football or rugby, for instance, can cause a broken neck. Cervical fractures may also be seen in some non-contact sports, such as [[gymnastics]], [[skiing]], [[Diving (sport)|diving]], [[surfing]], [[powerlifting]], [[equestrianism]], [[mountain biking]], and motor racing.

Certain penetrating neck injuries can also cause cervical fracture which can also  cause internal bleeding among other complications.

[[Hanging]] also causes a cervical fracture which kills the victim.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Cervical fracture dislocation C6-C7.jpeg|thumb|Sagittal reconstruction of a CT scan showing a cervical fracture with dislocation at the level of C6/7]]
[[File:TreadropfractureC3CTMarked.png|thumb|Teardrop fracture of C3 (sagittal CT)]]
[[File:TreadropfractureC3.png|thumb|Teardrop fracture of C3 (lateral X ray)]]

Severe pain will usually be present at the point of injury. Pressure on a [[nerve]] may also cause pain from the neck down the shoulders and/or arms. Bruising and swelling may be present at the back of the neck. A neurological exam will be performed to assess for spinal cord injury. [[X-ray]]s will be ordered to determine the severity and location of the fracture. CT ([[computed tomography]]) scans may be ordered to assess for gross abnormalities not visible by regular X-ray. MRI ([[magnetic resonance imaging]]) tests may be ordered to provide high resolution images of soft tissue and determine whether there has been damage to the [[spinal cord]], although such damage is usually obvious in the conscious patient because of the immediate functional consequences of numbness and paralysis in much of the body.

It is also common for imaging (either a plain film [[X-ray]] or [[CT scan]]) to be completed when assessing a cervical injury. This is the most common way to diagnose the location and severity of the fracture. To decrease the use C-spine scans yielding negative findings for fracture, thus unnecessarily exposing people to radiation and increase time in the hospital and cost of the visit, multiple clinical decision support rules have been developed to help clinicians weigh the option to scan a patient with a neck injury. Among these are the [[Canadian C-spine rule]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Stiell IG, Wells GA | display-authors=etal | title=The Canadian C-spine rule for radiography in alert and stable trauma patients.| journal=JAMA | year=2001 | volume= 286| issue=15 | pages=1841–8| doi= 10.1001/jama.286.15.1841| pmid=11597285}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the NEXUS criteria for C-Spine imaging,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Hoffman JR, Wolfson AB, Todd K, Mower WR | title=Selective cervical spine radiography in blunt trauma: methodology of the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS).| journal=Ann Emerg Med | year=1998 | volume=32 | issue=4| pages=461–9| doi= 10.1016/s0196-0644(98)70176-3| pmid=9774931}}&lt;/ref&gt; which both help make these decisions from easily obtained information. Both rules are widely used in emergency departments and by paramedics.

===Surgery indication===
The indication to surgically stabilize a cervical fracture can be estimated from the ''Subaxial Injury Classification'' (SLIC). In this system, a score of 3 or less indicates that [[conservative management]] is appropriate, a score of 5 or more indicates that surgery is needed, and a score of 4 is equivocal.&lt;ref name=Brockmeyer2016&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=r_gTDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94 Page 94] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=r_gTDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126 Page 126] in: {{cite book|title=Adult and Pediatric Spine Trauma, An Issue of Neurosurgery Clinics of North America|volume=28|issue=1|author=Douglas L. Brockmeyer, Andrew T. Dailey|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=2016|isbn=9780323482844}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score is the sum from 3 different categories: morphology, discs and ligaments, and neurology:&lt;ref name=Brockmeyer2016/&gt;

==Treatment==
Complete immobilization of the head and neck should be done as early as possible and before moving the patient. Immobilization should remain in place until movement of the head and neck is proven safe. ''In the presence of severe head trauma, cervical fracture must be presumed until ruled out.'' Immobilization is imperative to minimize or prevent further [[spinal cord injury]]. The only exceptions are when there is imminent danger from an external cause, such as becoming trapped in a burning building.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications ([[NSAIDs]]), such as [[aspirin]] or [[ibuprofen]], are contraindicated because they interfere with bone healing. Tylenol ([[acetaminophen]]) is a better option. Patients with cervical fractures will likely be prescribed medication for pain control.

In the long term, [[physical therapy]] will be given to build strength in the muscles of the neck to increase stability and  better protect the cervical spine.

[[cervical collar|Collars]], traction and surgery can be used to immobilize and stabilize the neck after a cervical fracture.

===Cervical collar===
Minor fractures can be immobilized with a [[cervical collar]] without need for traction or surgery. A soft collar is fairly flexible and is the least limiting but can carry a high risk of further neck damage in patients with [[osteoporosis]]. It can be used for minor injuries or after healing has allowed the neck to become more stable.

A range of manufactured rigid collars are also used, usually comprising a firm plastic bi-valved shell secured with [[Velcro]] straps and removable padded liners.  The most frequently prescribed are the [[Aspen collar|Aspen]], Malibu, Miami J, and Philadelphia collars. All these can be used with additional chest and head extension pieces to increase stability.

===Rigid braces===
Rigid braces that support the head and chest are also prescribed.&lt;ref&gt;{{URL | http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/314921-overview | Shantanu S Kulkarni, DO and Robert H Meier III, "Spinal Orthotics", '''Medscape Reference'''}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples include the  Sterno-Occipital Mandibular Immobilization Device (SOMI), Lerman Minerva and Yale types. Special patients, such as very young children or non-cooperative adults, are sometimes still immobilized in medical plaster of paris casts, such as the [[Orthopedic cast#Other casts|Minerva cast]].

===Traction===
[[Traction (orthopedics)|Traction]] can be applied by free weights on a pulley or a [[Halo (medicine)|Halo]] type brace. The [[Halo (medicine)|Halo brace]] is the most rigid  cervical brace, used when limiting motion to the minimum that is essential, especially with unstable cervical fractures. It can provide stability and support during the time (typically 8–12 weeks) needed for the cervical bones to heal.

===Surgery===
Surgery may be needed to stabilize the neck and relieve pressure on the spinal cord. A variety of surgeries are available depending on the injury. Surgery to remove a damaged [[intervertebral disc]] may be done to relieve pressure on the spinal cord. The discs are cushions between the vertebrae. After the disc is removed, the vertebrae may be fused together to provide stability. Metal plates, screws, or wires may be needed to hold vertebrae or pieces in place.

==History==
Arab physician and surgeon [[Ibn al-Quff]] (d. 1286 CE) described a treatment of cervical fractures through the oral route in his book ''Kitab al-ʿUmda fı Ṣinaʿa al-Jiraḥa'' (Book of Basics in the Art of Surgery).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aciduman |first1=Ahmet |last2=Belen |first2=Deniz |title=An Early Description of Using Oral Route for the Management of Cervical Vertebra Fracture by Ibn al-Quff in the Thirteenth Century |journal=World Neurosurgery |date=December 2018 |volume=120 |pages=476–484 |doi=10.1016/j.wneu.2018.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1760">A '''chiral shift reagent''' is a [[reagent]] used in [[analytical chemistry]] for determining the [[optical purity]] of a sample.  Some analytical techniques such as [[HPLC]] and [[NMR]], in their most commons forms, cannot distinguish [[enantiomer]]s within a sample, but can distinguish diastereomers.  Therefore, converting a mixture of enantiomers to a corresponding mixture of diastereomers can allow analysis.

One method involves the reaction of a [[chiral derivatizing agent]] (CDA) with a mixture of enantiomers to produce diasteromers via [[covalent]] attachment.  One of the most common CDA is [[Mosher's acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jo01261a013| title = α-Methoxy-α-trifluoromethylphenylacetic acid, a versatile reagent for the determination of enantiomeric composition of alcohols and amines| journal = The Journal of Organic Chemistry| volume = 34| issue = 9| pages = 2543–2549| year = 1969| last1 = Dale| first1 = James A| last2 = Dull| first2 = David L| last3 = Mosher| first3 = Harry S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method involves non-covalent interactions.  NMR shift reagents such as [[EuFOD]] and [[TRISPHAT]] take advantage of the formation of diastereomeric complexes between the shift reagent and the analytical sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1016/B978-044451010-5/50024-9| chapter = Lanthanide Nmr Shift Reagents| title = Modern Aspects of Rare Earths and Their Complexes| pages = 779–843| year = 2003| last1 = Sastri| first1 = V.S| last2 = Bünzli| first2 = Jean-Claude| last3 = Rao| first3 = V.

'''CANDELS''', the '''Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey''', is the largest [[Astronomical project|project]] in the history of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], with 902 assigned orbits (about two months) of observing time. It was carried out between 2010 and 2013 with two cameras on board Hubble – [[Wide Field Camera 3|WFC3]] and [[Advanced Camera for Surveys|ACS]] – and aims to explore [[Galaxy|galactic]] evolution in the early [[Universe]], and the very first seeds of cosmic structure at less than one billion years after the [[Big Bang theory|Big Bang]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1315/ '''Hubble explores the origins of modern galaxies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science goals==

The Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey is designed to document the first third of [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galactic evolution]] – on the [[redshift]]s from 8 to 1.5 – via [[Deep field|deep imaging]] of more than 250,000 galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;Another goal is to find the first [[Type Ia supernova|Type Ia]] [[Supernova|SNe]] beyond z &gt; 1.5 and establish their accuracy as [[standard candle]]s for [[cosmology]].&lt;br/&gt;Plus some "daytime" [[Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph|UVIS]] exposures in [[GOODS]]-N to exploit the [[Continuous Viewing Zone|CVZ]] opportunity in that field.&lt;!--IDK what that means exactly. I tried!--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://candels.ucolick.org/survey/Science_Goals.html CANDELS Science Goals]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- For further detalisation of the objectives in lower subsection: http://candels.ucolick.org/survey/Science_Goals.html --&gt;

==Facility and instruments==
CANDELS' main instrument is the [[WFC3|Wide Field Camera 3]], a  [[near-infrared]] camera, installed on Hubble in May 2009. WFC3 works in pair with the visible-light [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]], which together gives unprecedented panchromatic coverage of galaxies from optical wavelengths to the near-IR.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://candels.ucolick.org/About.html About CANDELS]"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crop rotation''' is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar or different types of [[crop]]s in the same area in sequenced [[season]]s. It is done so that the [[soil]] of farms is not used for only one set of nutrients.
It helps in reducing [[soil erosion]] and increases [[soil fertility]] and [[crop yield]].

Growing the same [[agriculture|crop]] in the same place for many years in a row ([[monocropping]]) disproportionately depletes the [[soil]] of certain [[nutrient]]s. With rotation, a crop that leaches the soil of one kind of nutrient is followed during the next growing season by a dissimilar crop that returns that nutrient to the soil or draws a different ratio of nutrients.  In addition, crop rotation mitigates the buildup of [[pathogen]]s and pests that often occurs when one species is continuously cropped, and can also improve [[soil structure]] and [[Soil fertility|fertility]] by increasing [[biomass]] from varied [[root (plant)|root]] structures.

Crop cycle is used in both conventional and [[organic farming]] systems.

== History ==
Agriculturalists have long recognized that suitable rotations—such as planting spring crops for livestock in place of grains for human consumption—make it possible to restore or to maintain a productive soil. Middle Eastern farmers practiced crop rotation in 6000 BC without understanding the chemistry, alternately planting legumes and cereals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} In the Bible, chapter 25 of the [[Book of Leviticus]] instructs the [[Israelites]] to observe a "[[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] of the Land". Every seventh year they would not till, prune or even control insects.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 | url = http://www.ecclesia.org/truth/sabbath-land.html
 | title = Sabbath of the Land
 | access-date = 2016-09-06
 | quote = It is a well-established agricultural fact that resting the land every seven years is best for the soil and that much-improved crops result from doing so. During this scriptural practice, there was to be no pruning or planting in the sabbath year, nor any attempt to kill the insects, or otherwise interfere with natural processes in the field. The fruit had to remain in the field, except for what passerby[sic], servants, or owners plucked to eat; no real harvesting was permitted, only eating.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Two-field system ===
Under a two-field rotation, half the land was planted in a year, while the other half lay [[wikt:fallow#Adjective|fallow]]. Then, in the next year, the two fields were reversed. From the times of [[Charlemagne]] (died 814), farmers in Europe transitioned from a two-field crop rotation to a three-field crop rotation.

=== Three-field system ===
{{main|Three-field system}}
From the end of the [[Middle Ages]] until the 20th century, Europe's farmers practised [[three-field rotation]], dividing available lands into three parts. One section was planted in the autumn with [[rye]] or winter [[wheat]], followed by spring [[oat]]s or [[barley]]; the second section grew crops such as peas, lentils, or beans; and the third field was left fallow. The three fields were rotated in this manner so that every three years, a field would rest and be fallow. Under the two-field system, if one has a total of {{convert|600|acre|km2}} of fertile land, one would only plant 300 acres. Under the new three-field rotation system, one would plant (and therefore harvest) 400 acres. But the additional crops had a more significant effect than mere quantitative productivity. Since the spring crops were mostly legumes, they increased the overall nutrition of the people of Northern Europe.

=== Four-field rotation ===
{{see also|Norfolk four-course system}}
Farmers in the region of [[Waasland]] (in present-day northern Belgium) pioneered a four-field rotation in the early 16th century, and the [[United Kingdom|British]] agriculturist [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]] (1674–1738) popularised this system in the 18th century. The sequence of four crops ([[wheat]], [[turnip]]s, [[barley]] and [[clover]]), included a [[fodder crop]] and a grazing crop, allowing [[livestock]] to be bred year-round. The four-field crop rotation became a key development in the [[British Agricultural Revolution]]. The rotation between arable and ley is sometimes called [[ley farming]].

=== Modern developments ===
[[George Washington Carver]] (1860s–1943) studied crop-rotation methods in the [[United States]], teaching [[Southern United States|southern]] farmers to rotate soil-depleting crops like cotton with soil-enriching crops like [[peanut]]s and [[pea]]s.

In the [[Green Revolution]] of the mid-20th century the traditional practice of crop rotation gave way in some parts of the world to the practice of supplementing the chemical inputs to the soil through [[topdressing]] with [[fertilizer]]s, adding (for example) [[ammonium nitrate]] or [[urea]] and restoring soil [[pH]] with [[Lime (mineral)|lime]]. Such practices aimed to increase yields, to prepare soil for specialist crops, and to reduce waste and inefficiency by simplifying planting and harvesting.

==Crop choice==
A preliminary assessment of crop interrelationships can be found in how each crop: (1) contributes to [[soil organic matter |soil organic matter (SOM)]] content, (2) provides for [[pest management]], (3) manages deficient or excess nutrients, and (4) how it contributes to or controls for soil erosion.&lt;ref name="NRCS"&gt;{{Cite report |date= July 2009 |title=Organic Production: Using NRCS Practice Standards to Support Organic Growers |publisher=[[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] |accessdate= May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crop choice is often related to the goal the farmer is looking to achieve with the rotation, which could be [[weed management]], increasing available [[nitrogen]] in the soil, controlling for erosion, or increasing soil structure and biomass, to name a few.&lt;ref name="dufourNCAT"&gt;{{Cite report |author=Dufour, Rex |date= July 2015 |title=Tipsheet: Crop Rotation in Organic Farming Systems |url=https://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/summaries/summary.php?pub=521 |publisher=[[National Center for Appropriate Technology]] |accessdate= May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing crop rotations, crops are classified in different ways depending on what quality is being assessed: by family, by nutrient needs/benefits, and/or by profitability (i.e. cash crop versus cover crop).&lt;ref name="baldwinCEFS"&gt;{{cite report|author=Baldwin, Keith R.|date=June 2006 |url=http://www.cefs.ncsu.edu/resources/organicproductionguide/croprotationsfinaljan09.pdf|title=Crop Rotations on Organic Farms|publisher=Center for Environmental Farming Systems |access-date= May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, giving adequate attention to plant family is essential to mitigating pests and pathogens. However, many farmers have success managing rotations by planning sequencing and cover crops around desirable cash crops.&lt;ref name="johnson2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Johnson, Sue Ellen |author2=Charles L. Mohler, |title=Crop Rotation on Organic Farms: A Planning Manual, NRAES 177 |publisher=National Resource, Agriculture, and Engineering Services (NRAES) |place=Ithica, NY |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-933395-21-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a simplified classification based on crop quality and purpose.

===Row crops===
Many crops which are critical for the market, like [[vegetable]]s, are row crops (that is, grown in tight rows).&lt;ref name=baldwinCEFS/&gt; While often the most profitable for farmers, these crops are more taxing on the soil.&lt;ref name=baldwinCEFS/&gt; Row crops typically have low biomass and shallow roots: this means the plant contributes low residue to the surrounding soil and has limited effects on structure.&lt;ref name="coleman2012"&gt;{{cite report|author=Coleman, Pamela|date=November 2012 |url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Guide%20for%20Organic%20Crop%20Producers_0.pdf|title=Guide for Organic Crop Producers|publisher=[[National Organic Program]] |access-date= May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With much of the soil around the plant exposed to disruption by rainfall and traffic, fields with row crops experience faster break down of organic matter by microbes, leaving fewer nutrients for future plants.&lt;ref name=coleman2012/&gt;

In short, while these crops may be profitable for the farm, they are nutrient depleting. Crop rotation practices exist to strike a balance between short-term profitability and long-term productivity.&lt;ref name="johnson2009"/&gt;

===Legumes===
A great advantage of crop rotation comes from the interrelationship of [[nitrogen fixing]]-crops with nitrogen demanding crops. Legumes, like alfalfa and clover, collect available nitrogen from the soil in nodules on their root structure.&lt;ref name=lamb2010/&gt; When the plant is harvested, the biomass of uncollected roots breaks down, making the stored nitrogen available to future crops. Legumes are also a valued [[green manure]]: a crop that collects nutrients and fixes them at soil depths accessible to future crops.&lt;ref name="RHS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=373|title=Green Manures|publisher=[[Royal Horticultural Society]]|access-date= May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, legumes have heavy tap roots that burrow deep into the ground, lifting soil for better tilth and absorption of water.

===Grasses and cereals===
Cereal and grasses are frequent cover crops because of the many advantages they supply to soil quality and structure. The dense and far-reaching root systems give ample structure to surrounding soil and provide significant biomass for [[soil organic matter]].

Grasses and cereals are key in weed management as they compete with undesired plants for soil space and nutrients.

===Green manure===
[[Green manure]] is a crop that is mixed into the soil. Both nitrogen-fixing legumes and nutrient scavengers, like grasses, can be used as green manure.&lt;ref name="lamb2010"&gt;{{Cite report |author1=Lamb, John |author2=Craig Sheaffer |author3=Kristine Moncada  |last-author-amp=yes |date= 2010 |chapter=Chapter 4 Soil Fertility |title=Risk Management Guide for Organic Producers |publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] |accessdate= May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green manure of legumes is an excellent source of nitrogen, especially for organic systems, however, legume biomass doesn't contribute to lasting [[soil organic matter]] like grasses do.&lt;ref name=lamb2010/&gt;

==Planning a rotation==
There are numerous factors that must be taken into consideration when planning a crop rotation. Planning an effective rotation requires weighing fixed and fluctuating production circumstances: market, farm size, labor supply, climate, soil type, growing practices, etc.&lt;ref name="bailey1907"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=L. H. Bailey |title=Chapter 5, "Crop Management," |encyclopedia=Cyclopedia of American Agriculture |pages=85–88 |year=1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a crop rotation must consider in what condition one crop will leave the soil for the succeeding crop and how one crop can be seeded with another crop.&lt;ref name=bailey1907/&gt; For example, a nitrogen-fixing crop, like a legume, should always precede a nitrogen depleting one; similarly, a low residue crop (i.e. a crop with low biomass) should be offset with a high biomass cover crop, like a mixture of grasses and legumes.&lt;ref name=NRCS/&gt;

There is no limit to the number of crops that can be used in a rotation, or the amount of time a rotation takes to complete.&lt;ref name=coleman2012/&gt; Decisions about rotations are made years prior, seasons prior, or even at the very last minute when an opportunity to increase profits or soil quality presents itself.&lt;ref name="johnson2009"/&gt; In short, there is no singular formula for rotation, but many considerations to take into account.

==Implementation==
Crop rotation systems may be enriched by the influences of other practices such as the addition of livestock and manure,&lt;ref name="NCATweb"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Gegner, Lance  |author2=George Kuepper |url=https://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/viewhtml.php?id=66|title=Organic Crop Production Overview|publisher=[[National Center for Appropriate Technology]]|date=August 2004 |access-date= May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[intercropping]] or [[multiple cropping]], and organic management low in pesticides and synthetic fertilizers.

===Incorporation of livestock===
Introducing [[livestock]] makes the most efficient use of critical [[sod]] and [[cover crops]]; livestock (through [[manure]]) are able to distribute the nutrients in these crops throughout the soil rather than removing nutrients from the farm through the sale of hay.&lt;ref name=coleman2012/&gt;

In Sub-Saharan Africa, as animal husbandry becomes less of a nomadic practice many herders have begun integrating crop production into their practice. This is known as mixed farming, or the practice of crop cultivation with the incorporation of raising cattle, sheep and/or goats by the same economic entity, is increasingly common. This interaction between the animal, the land and the crops are being done on a small scale all across this region. Crop residues provide animal feed, while the animals provide manure for replenishing crop nutrients and draft power. Both processes are extremely important in this region of the world as it is expensive and logistically unfeasible to transport in synthetic fertilizers and large-scale machinery. As an additional benefit, the cattle, sheep and/or goat provide milk and can act as a cash crop in the times of economic hardship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Powell, J.M. |author2=William, T.O. |title=An overview of mixed farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa |journal=Livestock and Sustainable Nutrient Cycling in Mixed Farming Systems of Sub-Saharan Africa: Proceedings of an International Conference, International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) |volume=2 |pages=21–36 |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organic farming===
Crop rotation is a required practice in order for a farm to receive [[organic certification]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="CFR"&gt;{{Cite web |title=§205.205 Crop rotation practice standard. |publisher=CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS |url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=bb1b055be7cb998ecf03fe5d32653807&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se7.3.205_1205&amp;rgn=div8 |accessdate=May 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The “Crop Rotation Practice Standard” for the [[National Organic Program]] under the [[Code of Federal Regulations|U.S. Code of Federal Regulations]], section §205.205, states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Farmers are required to implement a crop rotation that maintains or builds soil organic matter, works to control pests, manages and conserves nutrients, and protects against erosion. Producers of perennial crops that aren’t rotated may utilize other practices, such as cover crops, to maintain [[soil health]].&lt;ref name=coleman2012/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In addition to lowering the need for inputs by controlling for pests and weeds and increasing available nutrients, crop rotation helps organic growers increase the amount of biodiversity on their farms.&lt;ref name=coleman2012/&gt; Biodiversity is also a requirement of organic certification, however, there are no rules in place to regulate or reinforce this standard.&lt;ref name=coleman2012/&gt; Increasing the biodiversity of crops has beneficial effects on the surrounding ecosystem and can host a greater diversity of fauna, insects, and beneficial microorganism in the soil.&lt;&lt;ref name=coleman2012/&gt; Some studies point to increased nutrient availability from crop rotation under organic systems compared to conventional practices as organic practices are less likely to inhibit of beneficial microbes in soil organic matter.&lt;ref name="mader2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mäder, Paul |title=Arbuscular mycorrhizae in a long-term field trial comparing low-input (organic, biological) and high-input (conventional) farming systems in a crop rotation |journal=Biology and Fertility of Soils |volume=31 |pages=150–156 |year=2000 |doi=10.1007/s003740050638|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[multiple cropping]] and [[intercropping]] benefit from many of the same principals as crop rotation, they do not satisfy the requirement under the [[National Organic Program|NOP]].&lt;ref name=coleman2012/&gt;

===Intercropping===
[[Multiple cropping]] systems, such as [[intercropping]] or [[companion planting]], offer more diversity and complexity within the same season or rotation, for example the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|three sisters]]. An example of companion planting is the inter-planting of corn with pole beans and vining squash or pumpkins. In this system, the beans provide nitrogen; the corn provides support for the beans and a "screen" against squash vine borer; the vining squash provides a weed suppressive canopy and a discouragement for corn-hungry raccoons.&lt;ref name=dufourNCAT/&gt;

Double-cropping is common where two crops, typically of different species, are grown sequentially in the same growing season, or where one crop (e.g. vegetable) is grown continuously with a cover crop (e.g. wheat).&lt;ref name=NRCS/&gt; This is advantageous for small farms, who often cannot afford to leave cover crops to replenish the soil for extended periods of time, as larger farms can.&lt;ref name="johnson2009"/&gt; When multiple cropping is implemented on small farms, these systems can maximize benefits of crop rotation on available land resources.&lt;ref name="johnson2009"/&gt;

== Benefits ==
Agronomists describe the benefits to yield in rotated crops as "The Rotation Effect". There are many found benefits of rotation systems: however, there is no specific scientific basis for the sometimes 10-25% yield increase in a crop grown in rotation versus monoculture. The factors related to the increase are simply described as alleviation of the negative factors of monoculture cropping systems. Explanations due to improved nutrition; pest, pathogen, and weed stress reduction; and improved soil structure have been found in some cases to be correlated, but causation has not been determined for the majority of cropping systems.

Other benefits of rotation cropping systems include production cost advantages. Overall financial risks are more widely distributed over more diverse production of crops and/or livestock. Less reliance is placed on purchased inputs and over time crops can maintain production goals with fewer inputs. This in tandem with greater short and long term yields makes rotation a powerful tool for improving agricultural systems.

===Soil organic matter===
The use of different species in rotation allows for increased soil organic matter (SOM), greater soil structure, and improvement of the chemical and biological soil environment for crops. With more SOM, water infiltration and retention improves, providing increased drought tolerance and decreased erosion.

Soil organic matter is a mix of decaying material from biomass with active [[microorganism]]s. Crop rotation, by nature, increases exposure to biomass from sod, green manure, and a various other plant debris. The reduced need for intensive [[tillage]] under crop rotation allows biomass aggregation to lead to greater nutrient retention and utilization, decreasing the need for added nutrients.&lt;ref name=baldwinCEFS/&gt; With tillage, disruption and oxidation of soil creates a less conducive environment for diversity and proliferation of microorganisms in the soil. These microorganisms are what make nutrients available to plants. So, where "active" soil organic matter is a key to productive soil, soil with low microbial activity provides significantly fewer nutrients to plants; this is true even though the quantity of biomass left in the soil may be the same.

Soil microorganisms also decrease [[pathogen]] and [[pest (agriculture)|pest]] activity through competition. In addition, plants produce root exudates and other chemicals which manipulate their soil environment as well as their weed environment. Thus rotation allows increased yields from nutrient availability but also alleviation of [[allelopathy]] and competitive weed environments.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Carbon sequestration===
Studies have shown that crop rotations greatly increase [[soil carbon|soil organic carbon (SOC)]] content, the main constituent of [[soil organic matter]].&lt;ref name="triberti2016"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Triberti, Loretta |author2=Anna Nastri |author3=Guido Baldoni  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Long-term effects of crop rotation, manure fertilization on carbon sequestration and soil fertility |journal=European Journal of Agronomy |volume=74 |pages=47–55 |year=2016 |doi=10.1016/j.eja.2015.11.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon, along with hydrogen and oxygen, is a macronutrient for plants. Highly diverse rotations spanning long periods of time have shown to be even more effective in increasing SOC, while soil disturbances (e.g. from tillage) are responsible for exponential decline in SOC levels.&lt;ref name=triberti2016/&gt; In Brazil, conversion to no-till methods combined with intensive crop rotations has been shown an SOC sequestration rate of 0.41 tonnes per hectare per year.&lt;ref name="victoria2012"&gt;{{Cite report |author= Victoria, Reynaldo |date= 2012 |chapter=The Benefits of Soil Carbon |title=Risk Management Guide for Organic Producers |publisher=[[United Nations Environment Programme]] |accessdate= May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to enhancing crop productivity, sequestration of [[atmospheric carbon]] has great implications in reducing rates of [[climate change]] by removing carbon dioxide from the air.

===Nitrogen fixing===
Rotating crops adds nutrients to the soil. [[Legume]]s, plants of the family [[Fabaceae]], for instance, have nodules on their [[root]]s which contain [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[bacterium|bacteria]] called [[rhizobium|rhizobia]]. During a process called nodulation, the rhizobia bacteria use nutrients and water provided by the plant to convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, which is then converted into an organic compound that the plant can use as its nitrogen source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~teloynac/354n2fix.pdf|title=Nitrogen Fixation by Forage Legumes|last=Loynachan|first=Tom|date=December 1, 2016|website=Iowa State University|publisher=Department of Agrology|access-date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore makes good sense agriculturally to alternate them with cereals (family [[Poaceae]]) and other plants that require [[nitrate]]s. How much nitrogen made available to the plants depends on factors such as the kind of legume, the effectiveness of rhizobia bacteria, soil conditions, and the availability of elements necessary for plant food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.foragebeef.ca/$Foragebeef/frgebeef.nsf/all/frg90/$FILE/fertilitylegumefixation.pdf|title=Nitrogen Fixation and Inoculation of Forage Legumes|last=Adjei et. al|first=M. B.|date=December 1, 2016|website=Forage Beef|publisher=University of Florida|access-date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pathogen and pest control===
Crop rotation is also used to control pests and diseases that can become established in the soil over time. The changing of crops in a sequence decreases the population level of pests by (1)       interrupting pest life cycles and (2) interrupting pest habitat.&lt;ref name="johnson2009"/&gt; Plants within the same [[taxonomic family]] tend to have similar pests and pathogens. By regularly changing crops and keeping the soil occupied by cover crops instead of lying fallow, pest cycles can be broken or limited, especially cycles that benefit from overwintering in residue.&lt;ref name=moncada2010/&gt; For example, [[root-knot nematode]] is a serious problem for some plants in warm climates and sandy soils, where it slowly builds up to high levels in the soil, and can severely damage plant productivity by cutting off circulation from the plant roots. Growing a crop that is not a host for root-knot nematode for one season greatly reduces the level of the nematode in the soil, thus making it possible to grow a susceptible crop the following season without needing soil [[fumigation]].

This principle is of particular use in [[organic farming]], where [[biological pest control|pest control]] must be achieved without synthetic pesticides.&lt;ref name="NCATweb"/&gt;

===Weed management===
Integrating certain crops, especially [[cover crops]], into crop rotations is of particular value to [[weed control|weed management]]. These crops crowd out weed through competition. In addition, the sod and compost from cover crops and green manure slows the growth of what weeds are still able to make it through the soil, giving the crops further competitive advantage. By removing slowing the growth and proliferation of weeds while cover crops are cultivated, farmers greatly reduce the presence of weeds for future crops, including shallow rooted and row crops, which are less resistant to weeds. Cover crops are, therefore, considered conservation crops because they protect otherwise fallow land from becoming overrun with weeds.&lt;ref name="moncada2010"&gt;{{Cite report |author1=Moncada, Kristine  |author2=Craig Sheaffer |date= 2010 |chapter=Chapter 2 Rotation |title=Risk Management Guide for Organic Producers |publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] |accessdate= May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This system has advantages over other common practices for weeds management, such as [[tillage]]. Tillage is meant to inhibit growth of weeds by overturning the soil; however, this has a countering effect of exposing weed seeds that may have gotten buried and burying valuable crop seeds. Under crop rotation, the number of viable seeds in the soil is reduced through the reduction of the weed population.

In addition to their negative impact on crop quality and yield, weeds can slow down the harvesting process. Weeds make farmers less efficient when harvesting, because weeds like bindweeds, and knotgrass, can become tangled in the equipment, resulting in a stop-and-go type of harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://potatoes.ahdb.org.uk/sites/default/files/publication_upload/Weed%20Control%20in%20Potatoes.pdf|title=Weed Control in Potatoes|last=Davies|first=Ken|date=March 2007|website=|publisher=British Potato Council|access-date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventing soil erosion===
Crop rotation can significantly reduce the amount of soil lost from [[erosion]] by water. In areas that are highly susceptible to erosion, farm management practices such as zero and reduced tillage can be supplemented with specific crop rotation methods to reduce raindrop impact, sediment detachment, [[sediment transport]], [[surface runoff]], and soil loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Unger PW, McCalla TM |title=Conservation Tillage Systems |journal=Advances in Agronomy |volume=33 |pages=2–53 |year=1980 |doi=10.1016/s0065-2113(08)60163-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protection against soil loss is maximized with rotation methods that leave the greatest mass of crop stubble (plant residue left after harvest) on top of the soil. Stubble cover in contact with the soil minimizes erosion from water by reducing overland flow velocity, stream power, and thus the ability of the water to detach and transport sediment.&lt;ref&gt;Rose CW, Freebairn DM. "A mathematical model of soil erosion and deposition processes with application to field data".&lt;/ref&gt; Soil Erosion and Cill prevent the disruption and detachment of soil aggregates that cause macropores to block, infiltration to decline, and runoff to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Loch RJ, Foley JL |title=Measurement of Aggregate Breakdown under rain: comparison with tests of water stability and relationships with field measurements of infiltration |journal=Australian Journal of Soil Research |volume=32 |pages=701–720 |year=1994 |doi=10.1071/sr9940701}}&lt;/ref&gt; This significantly improves the resilience of soils when subjected to periods of erosion and stress.

When a forage crop breaks down, binding products are formed that act like an adhesive on the soil, which makes particles stick together, and form aggregates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soilcc.ca/ggmp_fact_sheets/pdf/Forages%20in%20rotation.pdf|title=Forages in Rotation|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=Saskatchewan Soil Conservation Association|access-date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of soil aggregates is important for erosion control, as they are better able to resist raindrop impact, and water erosion. Soil aggregates also reduce wind erosion, because they are larger particles, and are more resistant to abrasion through tillage practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soilquality.org/indicators/aggregate_stability.html|title=Aggregate Stability|last=|first=|date=2011|website=|publisher=Natural Resources Conservation Centre|access-date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of crop rotation on erosion control varies by climate. In regions under relatively consistent climate conditions, where annual rainfall and temperature levels are assumed, rigid crop rotations can produce sufficient plant growth and soil cover. In regions where climate conditions are less predictable, and unexpected periods of rain and drought may occur, a more flexible approach for soil cover by crop rotation is necessary. An opportunity cropping system promotes adequate soil cover under these erratic climate conditions.&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carroll C, Halpin M, Burger P, Bell K, Sallaway MM, Yule DF |title=The effect of crop type, crop rotation, and tillage practice on runoff and soil loss on a Vertisol in central Queensland |journal=Australian Journal of Soil Research |volume=35 |pages=925–939 |year=1997 |doi=10.1071/s96017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an opportunity cropping system, crops are grown when soil water is adequate and there is a reliable sowing window. This form of cropping system is likely to produce better soil cover than a rigid crop rotation because crops are only sown under optimal conditions, whereas rigid systems are not necessarily sown in the best conditions available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Littleboy M, Silburn DM, Freebairn DM, Woodruff DR, Hammer GL |title=PERFECT. A computer simulation model of Productive Erosion Runoff Functions to Evaluate Conservation Techniques |journal=Queensland Department of Primary Industries. Bulletin QB89005 |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crop rotations also affect the timing and length of when a field is subject to fallow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang M, Shao M, Zhang L, Li Y |title=Water use efficiency and sustainability of different long-term crop rotation systems in the Loess Plateau of China |journal=Soil &amp; Tillage Research |volume=72 |pages=95–104 |year=2003 |doi=10.1016/s0167-1987(03)00065-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is very important because depending on a particular region's climate, a field could be the most vulnerable to erosion when it is under fallow. Efficient fallow management is an essential part of reducing erosion in a crop rotation system. Zero tillage is a fundamental management practice that promotes crop stubble retention under longer unplanned fallows when crops cannot be planted.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; Such management practices that succeed in retaining suitable soil cover in areas under fallow will ultimately reduce soil loss. In a recent study that lasted a decade, it was found that a common winter cover crop after potato harvest such as fall rye can reduce soil run-off by as much as 43%, and this is typically the most nutritional soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.peicanada.com/island_farmer/article_1f8f774a-ea1d-11e5-b9b4-2314cedac479.html|title=Cover crops have major role to play in soil health|last=Walker|first=Andy|newspaper=peicanada.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing the biodiversity of crops has beneficial effects on the surrounding ecosystem and can host a greater diversity of fauna, insects, and beneficial microorganisms in the soil.&lt;ref name=coleman2012/&gt; Some studies point to increased nutrient availability from crop rotation under organic systems compared to conventional practices as organic practices are less likely to inhibit of beneficial microbes in soil organic matter, such as arbuscular mycorrhizae, which increase nutrient uptake in plants.&lt;ref name="mader2000"/&gt; Increasing biodiversity also increases the resilience of agro-ecological systems.&lt;ref name=baldwinCEFS/&gt;

===Farm productivity===
Crop rotation contributes to increased yields through improved soil nutrition. By requiring planting and harvesting of different crops at different times, more land can be farmed with the same amount of machinery and labour.

===Risk management===
Different crops in the rotation can reduce the risks of adverse weather for the individual farmer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://permaculturenews.org/2016/06/15/crop-rotation-a-vital-component-of-organic-farming/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1334&amp;context=agronomyfacpub]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
While crop rotation requires a great deal of planning, crop choice must respond to a number of fixed conditions (soil type, topography, climate, and irrigation) in addition to conditions that may change dramatically from year to the next (weather, market, labor supply).&lt;ref name="johnson2009"/&gt; In this way, it is unwise to plan crops years in advance. Improper implementation of a crop rotation plan may lead to imbalances in the soil nutrient composition or a buildup of pathogens affecting a critical crop.&lt;ref name="johnson2009"/&gt; The consequences of faulty rotation may take years to become apparent even to experienced soil scientists and can take just as long to correct.&lt;ref name="johnson2009"/&gt;

Many challenges exist within the practices associated with crop rotation. For example, [[green manure]] from legumes can lead to an invasion of snails or slugs and the decay from green manure can occasionally suppress the growth of other crops.&lt;ref name="RHS"/&gt;

'''Crystal optics''' is the branch of [[optics]] that describes the behaviour of [[light]] in ''[[anisotropic]] media'', that is, media (such as [[crystal]]s) in which light behaves differently depending on which direction the light is [[Wave propagation|propagating]]. The index of refraction depends on both composition and crystal structure and can be calculated using the [[Gladstone–Dale relation]]. Crystals are often naturally anisotropic, and in some media (such as [[liquid crystal]]s) it is possible to induce anisotropy by applying an external electric field.

==Isotropic media==

Typical transparent media such as [[glass]]es are ''[[isotropic]]'', which means that light behaves the same way no matter which direction it is travelling in the medium. In terms of [[Maxwell's equations]] in a [[dielectric]], this gives a relationship between the [[electric displacement field]] '''D''' and the [[electric field]] '''E''':

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{D} = \varepsilon_0  \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P}  &lt;/math&gt;

where ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[permittivity]] of free space and '''P''' is the electric [[polarization (electrostatics)|polarization]] (the [[vector field]] corresponding to [[electric dipole moment]]s present in the medium). Physically, the polarization field can be regarded as the response of the medium to the electric field of the light.

===Electric susceptibility===

In an [[isotropic]] and [[linear]] medium, this polarization field '''P''' is proportional and parallel to the electric field '''E''':

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P}  = \chi \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E}  &lt;/math&gt;

where χ is the ''[[electric susceptibility]]'' of the medium. The relation between '''D''' and '''E''' is thus:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{D}  =   \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E}  +  \chi \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E}   
=  \varepsilon_0  (1 + \chi)  \mathbf{E}   =  \varepsilon   \mathbf{E}  &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon =  \varepsilon_0  (1 + \chi) &lt;/math&gt;

is the [[dielectric constant]] of the medium.  The value 1+χ is called the ''relative permittivity'' of the medium, and is related to the [[refractive index]] ''n'', for non-magnetic media, by

:&lt;math&gt;  n = \sqrt{ 1 + \chi}  &lt;/math&gt;

==Anisotropic media==

In an anisotropic medium, such as a crystal, the polarisation field '''P''' is not necessarily aligned with the electric field of the light '''E'''. In a physical picture, this can be thought of as the dipoles induced in the medium by the electric field having certain preferred directions, related to the physical structure of the crystal. This can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P} = \varepsilon_0 \boldsymbol{\chi} \mathbf{E} .&lt;/math&gt;

Here '''χ''' is not a number as before but a [[tensor]] of rank 2, the ''electric susceptibility tensor''. In terms of components in 3 dimensions:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} P_x \\ P_y \\ P_z \end{pmatrix} = \varepsilon_0
\begin{pmatrix} \chi_{xx} &amp; \chi_{xy} &amp; \chi_{xz} \\ \chi_{yx} &amp; \chi_{yy} &amp; \chi_{yz} \\ \chi_{zx} &amp; \chi_{zy} &amp; \chi_{zz} \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} E_x \\ E_y \\ E_z \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

or using the summation convention:

:&lt;math&gt; P_i = \varepsilon_0 \sum_{j\in\{x,y,z\}}\chi_{ij} E_j \quad.&lt;/math&gt;

Since '''χ''' is a tensor, '''P''' is not necessarily colinear with '''E'''.

In nonmagnetic and transparent materials, χ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = χ&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. the '''χ''' tensor is real and [[symmetric tensor|symmetric]].&lt;ref&gt;Amnon Yariv, Pochi Yeh. (2006). Photonics optical electronics in modern communications (6th ed.). Oxford University Press. pp. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with the [[spectral theorem]], it is thus possible to [[Matrix diagonalization|diagonalise]] the tensor by choosing the appropriate set of coordinate axes, zeroing all components of the tensor except χ&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt;, χ&lt;sub&gt;yy&lt;/sub&gt; and χ&lt;sub&gt;zz&lt;/sub&gt;. This gives the set of relations:

:&lt;math&gt; P_x = \varepsilon_0 \chi_{xx} E_x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; P_y = \varepsilon_0 \chi_{yy} E_y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; P_z = \varepsilon_0 \chi_{zz} E_z&lt;/math&gt;

The directions x, y and z are in this case known as the ''principal axes'' of the medium. Note that these axes will be orthogonal if all entries in the '''χ''' tensor are real, corresponding to a case in which the refractive index is real in all directions.

It follows that '''D''' and '''E''' are also related by a tensor:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{D} = \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P} = \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \varepsilon_0 \boldsymbol{\chi} \mathbf{E} = \varepsilon_0 (I + \boldsymbol{\chi}) \mathbf{E} = \varepsilon_0 \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \mathbf{E} .&lt;/math&gt;

Here '''ε''' is known as the ''relative permittivity tensor'' or ''dielectric tensor''. Consequently, the [[refractive index]] of the medium must also be a tensor. Consider a light wave propagating along the z principal axis [[Polarization (waves)|polarised]] such the electric field of the wave is parallel to the x-axis. The wave experiences a susceptibility χ&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt; and a permittivity ε&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt;. The refractive index is thus:

:&lt;math&gt;n_{xx} = (1 + \chi_{xx})^{1/2} = (\varepsilon_{xx})^{1/2} .&lt;/math&gt;

For a wave polarised in the y direction:

:&lt;math&gt;n_{yy} = (1 + \chi_{yy})^{1/2} = (\varepsilon_{yy})^{1/2} .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus these waves will see two different refractive indices and travel at different speeds. This phenomenon is known as ''[[birefringence]]'' and occurs in some common crystals such as [[calcite]] and [[quartz]]. 

If χ&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt; = χ&lt;sub&gt;yy&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ χ&lt;sub&gt;zz&lt;/sub&gt;, the crystal is known as '''uniaxial'''.  (See [[Optic axis of a crystal]].) If χ&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ χ&lt;sub&gt;yy&lt;/sub&gt; and χ&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ χ&lt;sub&gt;zz&lt;/sub&gt; the crystal is called '''biaxial'''. A uniaxial crystal exhibits two refractive indices, an "ordinary" index (''n''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) for light polarised in the x or y directions, and an "extraordinary" index (''n''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) for polarisation in the z direction. A uniaxial crystal is "positive" if n&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; n&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; and "negative" if n&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; n&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. Light polarised at some angle to the axes will experience a different phase velocity for different polarization components, and cannot be described by a single index of refraction. This is often depicted as an [[index ellipsoid]].

==Other effects==

Certain [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] phenomena such as the [[electro-optic effect]] cause a variation of a medium's permittivity tensor when an external electric field is applied, proportional (to lowest order) to the strength of the field. This causes a rotation of the principal axes of the medium and alters the behaviour of light travelling through it; the effect can be used to produce light modulators.

In response to a [[magnetic field]], some materials can have a dielectric tensor that is complex-[[Hermitian]]; this is called a gyro-magnetic or [[magneto-optic effect]].  In this case, the [[Principal axis (crystallography)|principal axes]] are complex-valued vectors, corresponding to elliptically polarized light, and time-reversal symmetry can be broken.  This can be used to design [[optical isolator]]s, for example.

A dielectric tensor that is not Hermitian gives rise to complex eigenvalues, which corresponds to a material with gain or absorption at a particular frequency.

The most commonly used barcode region for animals and some [[protist]]s is a segment of approximately 600 [[base pair]]s of the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] gene [[Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I|cytochrome oxidase I]] (COI or [[Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I|COX1]]). This differs in the case of [[Fungus|fungi]], where part of [[Internal transcribed spacer|Internal Transcribed Spacer]] 2 ([[ITS2]]) between [[Ribosomal RNA|rRNA]] genes is used, and again in plants, where multiple regions are used.

Applications include, for example, identifying plant leaves even when flowers or fruit are not available, identifying [[Pollen DNA barcoding|pollen]] collected on the bodies of pollinating animals, identifying insect larvae (which may have fewer diagnostic characters than adults and are frequently less well-known), identifying the diet of an animal, based on its stomach contents or faeces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Soininen EM, Valentini A, Coissac E, Miquel C, Gielly L, Brochmann C, Brysting AK, Sønstebø JH, Ims RA, Yoccoz NG, Taberlet P | title = Analysing diet of small herbivores: the efficiency of DNA barcoding coupled with high-throughput pyrosequencing for deciphering the composition of complex plant mixtures | journal = Frontiers in Zoology | volume = 6 | pages = 16 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19695081 | pmc = 2736939 | doi = 10.1186/1742-9994-6-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and identifying products in commerce (for example, herbal supplements, wood, or skins and other animal parts).&lt;ref name="Kress"/&gt;

==Background==
Although the use of [[nucleotide]] sequence variations to investigate evolutionary relationships is not a new concept ([[Carl Woese]] used sequence differences in [[rRNA|ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) to discover [[archaea]], which in turn led to the redrawing of the [[evolutionary tree]], and [[Molecular marker|molecular markers]] (e.g., allozymes, rDNA, and mtDNA sequences) have been successfully used in molecular [[systematics]] for decades), the modern concept of DNA barcoding as a proposed standardized method for identifying species, as well as potentially allocating unknown sequences to higher taxa such as orders and phyla, originates from a 2003 paper by [[Paul D.N. Hebert]] and co-workers from the [[University of Guelph]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Hebert and his colleagues demonstrated the utility of a  648 base pair region of the cytochrome ''c'' oxidase I (COI) gene, first utilized by O. Folmer and co-workers at [[Rutgers University]] in 1994 as a tool for phylogenetic analyses at the species and higher taxonomic levels,&lt;ref name="pmid7881515"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Folmer O, Black M, Hoeh W, Lutz R, Vrijenhoek R | title = DNA primers for amplification of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I from diverse metazoan invertebrates | journal = Molecular Marine Biology and Biotechnology | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 294–9 | date = October 1994 | pmid = 7881515 | doi = | url = https://www.mbari.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Folmer_94MMBB.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a suitable discriminatory tool between metazoan animal species.&lt;ref name="Hebert2003" /&gt; The study authors created a COI "profile" for eight of the most diverse orders of [[insects]], based on a single representative from each of 100 different families, and showed that this profile assigned each of 50 newly analysed taxa to its correct order; they then created a COI profile for 200 closely allied species of the insect order [[Lepidoptera]], and employed the method to successfully assign 150 newly analysed individuals to species.

Calling the profiles "barcodes", Hebert ''et al.'' envisaged the development of a COI database that could serve as the basis for a "global bioidentification system", and wrote: "When fully developed, a COI identification system will provide a reliable, cost-effective and accessible solution to the current problem of species identification. Its assembly will also generate important new insights into the diversification of life and the rules of molecular evolution."&lt;ref name="Hebert2003" /&gt; In a follow-up paper, Hebert and different co-authors tested COI differences in congeneric species pairs (2,238 species) from 11 phyla of animals plus the four dominant orders of insects (Coleoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera) as well as "other insects" and concluded that species level discrimination was satisfactory using the proposed COI gene region in all the groups studied with the exception of Cnidaria, which they ascribed to the exceptionally low rates of mitochondrial evolution in the latter group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hebert PD, Ratnasingham S, deWaard JR | title = Barcoding animal life: cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 divergences among closely related species | journal = Proceedings.

Since that time, DNA barcoding has been widely adopted in numerous studies of animals in particular, using the initially proposed "Folmer region" of the COI gene, based on its patterns of variation at the DNA level, the relative ease of retrieving the sequence, and its characteristic of being sufficiently conserved within species, yet sufficiently variable between species to enable reliable identification of each taxon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pentinsaari M, Salmela H, Mutanen M, Roslin T | title = Molecular evolution of a widely-adopted taxonomic marker (COI) across the animal tree of life | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | pages = 35275 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27734964 | pmc = 5062346 | doi = 10.1038/srep35275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Global DNA barcoding was initially regarded as a "big science" programme&lt;ref name="Gregory2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gregory TR | title = DNA barcoding does not compete with taxonomy | journal = Nature | volume = 434 | issue = 7037 | pages = 1067 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15858548 | doi = 10.1038/4341067b }}&lt;/ref&gt; and even as the renaissance of taxonomy.&lt;ref name="miller2007" /&gt; However, the COI sequence, which has been developed as a universal barcode in animals, does not discriminate most [[plants]] or [[fungi]] because of a much slower mutation rate in those groups; barcoding of [[protists]] also presents some challenges, as documented by Pawlowski ''et al.'', 2012.&lt;ref name="Pawlowski_et_al"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pawlowski J, Audic S, Adl S, Bass D, Belbahri L, Berney C, Bowser SS, Cepicka I, Decelle J, Dunthorn M, Fiore-Donno AM, Gile GH, Holzmann M, Jahn R, Jirků M, Keeling PJ, Kostka M, Kudryavtsev A, Lara E, Lukeš J, Mann DG, Mitchell EA, Nitsche F, Romeralo M, Saunders GW, Simpson AG, Smirnov AV, Spouge JL, Stern RF, Stoeck T, Zimmermann J, Schindel D, de Vargas C | collaboration = CBOL Protist Working Group | title = Barcoding Eukaryotic Richness beyond the Animal, Plant, and Fungal Kingdoms | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 10 | issue = 11 | pages = e1001419 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23139639 | pmc = 3491025 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001419 | displayauthors = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coordination of global activities in DNA Barcoding is now managed via the [[Consortium for the Barcode of Life]] (CBOL). Vouchered DNA sequences are deposited in the publicly accessible [[Barcode of Life Data Systems]] (BOLD) database which, as of June 2017, contained nearly 5,500,000 barcode sequences from over 265,000 species of animals, plants, and fungi.

== Choice of locus ==
A desirable locus for DNA barcoding should be standardized (so that large databases of sequences for that locus can be developed),&lt;ref name="chase1993"/&gt; present in most of the taxa of interest and sequenceable without species-specific [[PCR primer]]s,&lt;ref name="chase1993"/&gt; short enough to be easily sequenced with current technology,&lt;ref name="kress2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kress WJ, Erickson DL | title = DNA barcodes: genes, genomics, and bioinformatics | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 8 | pages = 2761–2 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18287050 | pmc = 2268532 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0800476105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and provide a large variation between species yet a relatively small amount of variation within a species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lahaye R, van der Bank M, Bogarin D, Warner J, Pupulin F, Gigot G, Maurin O, Duthoit S, Barraclough TG, Savolainen V | title = DNA barcoding the floras of biodiversity hotspots | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 8 | pages = 2923–8 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18258745 | pmc = 2268561 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0709936105 | displayauthors = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several loci have been suggested, a common set of standardized regions were selected by the respective committees of COBOL:

For [[protists]], a final recommendation has not yet been made; a 2012 Working Group report suggests that a 2-stage approach will most likely be required, using a "pre-barcode" based on 18S rDNA followed by a yet to be defined second test according to the result of the first (additional details given below).

===Barcoding animals===
DNA barcoding of animals is based on a relatively simple concept. All [[eukaryote]] cells contain [[mitochondria]], and animal mitochondrial DNA ([[mtDNA]]) has a relatively fast [[mutation]] rate, resulting in the generation of diversity within and between populations over relatively short evolutionary timescales (thousands of generations). Typically, in animals, a single mtDNA genome is transmitted to offspring by each breeding female, and the genetic [[effective population size]] is [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the number of breeding females. This contrasts with the [[nuclear genome]], which is around 100 000 times larger, where males and females each contribute two full genomes to the [[gene pool]] and effective size is therefore proportional to twice the total population size. This reduction in [[effective population size]] leads to more rapid sorting of mtDNA gene lineages within and among populations through time, due to variance in [[fecundity]] among individuals (the principle of [[coalescence (genetics)|coalescence]]). The combined effect of higher mutation rates and more rapid sorting of variation usually results in divergence of mtDNA sequences among species and a comparatively small variance within species.

Exceptions, where mtDNA fails as a test of species identity, can occur through occasional recombination (direct evidence for recombination in mtDNA is available in some [[bivalve]]s such as ''Mytilus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ladoukakis ED, Zouros E | title = Direct evidence for homologous recombination in mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) mitochondrial DNA | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 1168–75 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11420358 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003904 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is suspected that it may be more widespread&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsaousis AD, Martin DP, Ladoukakis ED, Posada D, Zouros E | title = Widespread recombination in published animal mtDNA sequences | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 925–33 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15647518 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msi084 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and through occurrences of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Melo-Ferreira J, Boursot P, Suchentrunk F, Ferrand N, Alves PC | title = Invasion from the cold past: extensive introgression of mountain hare (Lepus timidus) mitochondrial DNA into three other hare species in northern Iberia | journal = Molecular Ecology | volume = 14 | issue = 8 | pages = 2459–64 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15969727 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02599.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Male-killing microorganisms,&lt;ref name=JohnstoneHurst&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnstone RA, Hurst GD |title=Maternally inherited male-killing microorganisms may confound interpretation of mitochondrial DNA variability |journal=Biol.

Occasional [[horizontal gene transfer]] (such as via cellular symbionts&lt;ref name=Hurstetal&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurst GD, Jiggins FM | title = Problems with mitochondrial DNA as a marker in population, phylogeographic and phylogenetic studies: the effects of inherited symbionts | journal = Proceedings.

A 2017 study by Rach ''et al.'' in the dragonflies and the damselflies ([[Odonata]]), a basal group of insects, found that the "standard" (Folmer) region of the COI gene was sub-optimal for species resolution in that group, and that a different portion of the same gene, which they termed COIB, showed higher success in discriminating sister taxa at different taxonomic levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rach J, Bergmann T, Paknia O, DeSalle R, Schierwater B, Hadrys H | title = The marker choice: Unexpected resolving power of an unexplored CO1 region for layered DNA barcoding approaches | journal = PLOS One | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = e0174842 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28406914 | pmc = 5390999 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0174842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors therefore suggested that a layered barcode approach, i.e. adding a second, a third or even more additional markers to enhance the discrimination potential, may be desirable, particularly in metabarcoding studies where the taxonomic composition within the samples may not be known in advance.

In [[Cnidaria]], where the COI gene has been found to be unsuitable on account of its slow rate of evolution in that group, more success has been reported using a combination of COI plus a short, adjacent intergenic region (igr1) plus a fragment of the octocoral‐specific mitochondrial protein‐coding gene, msh1 in octocorals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McFadden CS, Benayahu Y, Pante E, Thoma JN, Nevarez PA, France SC | title = Limitations of mitochondrial gene barcoding in Octocorallia | journal = Molecular Ecology Resources | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–31 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21429097 | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-0998.2010.02875.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 16S mitochondrial ribosomal RNA gene in pelagic forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindsay |first1=Dhugal J. |last2=Grossmann |first2=Mary M. |last3=Nishikawa |first3=Jun |last4=Bentlage |first4=Bastian |last5=Collins |first5=Allen G. | name-list-format = vanc |year=2015 |hdl=10088/29737 |title=DNA barcoding of pelagic cnidarians: current status and future prospects |journal=Bulletin of the Plankton Society of Japan |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=39–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sponges]], the other major non-[[Bilateria]]n animal group, congeneric species are difficult to amplify or separate with the standard COI barcoding fragment, and data compilation and study is presently focussed on the ribosomal RNA 28S C-Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.spongebarcoding.org/approach.php |website=The Sponge Barcoding Project |title=Approach |access-date=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barcoding flowering plants ===

The use of the COI sequence is not appropriate in plants because of slower rate of cytochrome c oxidase I gene evolution in higher plants than in animals.&lt;ref name="Kress"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kress WJ, Wurdack KJ, Zimmer EA, Weigt LA, Janzen DH | title = Use of DNA barcodes to identify flowering plants | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 23 | pages = 8369–74 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15928076 | pmc = 1142120 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0503123102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of experiments was conducted to find a more suitable region of the [[genome]] for use in the DNA barcoding of [[flowering plant]]s (or the larger group of [[land plant]]s).&lt;ref name="kress2008" /&gt; Nuclear [[internal transcribed spacer]] region and the plastid trnH-psbA intergenic spacer;&lt;ref name=Kress/&gt; other researchers advocated other regions such as [[Maturase K|matK]].&lt;ref name="kress2008" /&gt;

Two chloroplast genes, the combination of [[RuBisCO large subunit|rbcL]] and [[Maturase K|matK]] have been proposed as a barcode for plants.&lt;ref name="chase1993"/&gt; Adding the nuclear internal transcribed spacer ITS2 region was proposed to provide better resolution between species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen S, Yao H, Han J, Liu C, Song J, Shi L, Zhu Y, Ma X, Gao T, Pang X, Luo K, Li Y, Li X, Jia X, Lin Y, Leon C | title = Validation of the ITS2 region as a novel DNA barcode for identifying medicinal plant species | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = e8613 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20062805 | pmc = 2799520 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0008613 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chloroplast region ''ycf1'' may be a more suitable gene.&lt;ref name=Dong/&gt;

===Barcoding fungi===
As noted above, the current, officially approved barcoding locus for fungi is the ITS region, chosen from a group of six candidates (SSU, LSU, ITS, RPB1, RPB2, MCM7) as the most broadly applicable across major fungal lineages. However, the ITS region has been noted as not working well in some highly speciose genera such as ''[[Aspergillus]]'', ''[[Cladosporium]]'', ''[[Fusarium]]'', ''[[Penicillium]]'' and ''[[Trichoderma]]'', since these taxa have narrow or no barcode gaps in their ITS regions; it may therefore be necessary to sequence one or more single-copy protein-coding genes as a secondary barcode marker for certain fungal genera and/or lineages in order to obtain the most precise identifications at the species level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raja HA, Miller AN, Pearce CJ, Oberlies NH | title = Fungal Identification Using Molecular Tools: A Primer for the Natural Products Research Community | journal = Journal of Natural Products | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 756–770 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28199101 | pmc = 5368684 | doi = 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b01085 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stielow ''et al.''

===Barcoding protists===
The Protist Working Group (ProWG) of the Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL) reported that for [[protists]]—a "convenience" group of mainly single-celled eukaryotes representing many diverse lineages presently characterized as a range of "supergroups"—a 2-stage strategy is recommended: first, a preliminary identification using a universal eukaryotic barcode, called the pre-barcode, proposed to be the ∼500 base pair variable V4 region of 18S rDNA, followed by a second, group-specific barcode yet to be fully defined, for which stated possibilities include 28S rDNA, ITS rDNA, 18S rDNA, COI, rbcL, SL RNA and perhaps more.&lt;ref name="Pawlowski_et_al" /&gt;

==Vouchered specimens==
DNA sequence databases like GenBank contain many sequences that are not tied to vouchered specimens (for example, herbarium specimens, cultured cell lines, or sometimes images). This is problematic in the face of taxonomic issues such as whether several species should be split or combined, or whether past identifications were sound. Therefore, best practice for DNA barcoding is to sequence vouchered specimens.&lt;ref name="schander2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="miller2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller SE | title = DNA barcoding and the renaissance of taxonomy | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 12 | pages = 4775–6 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17363473 | pmc = 1829212 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0700466104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==

===Identification of birds===

In an effort to find a relationship between traditional species boundaries established by taxonomy and those inferred by DNA barcoding, Hebert and co-workers sequenced DNA barcodes of 260 of the 667 bird species that breed in [[North America]] (Hebert ''et al.'' 2004a&lt;ref name=HebertBirds&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hebert PD, Stoeckle MY, Zemlak TS, Francis CM | title = Identification of Birds through DNA Barcodes | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 10 | pages = e312 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15455034 | pmc = 518999 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). They found that every single one of the 260 species had a different COI sequence. 130 species were represented by two or more specimens; in all of these species, COI sequences were either identical or were most similar to sequences of the same species. COI variations between species averaged 7.93%, whereas variation within species averaged 0.43%. In four cases there were deep intraspecific divergences, indicating possible new species. Three out of these four [[Polytypic taxon|polytypic]] species are already split into two by some taxonomists. Hebert ''et al.'''s (2004a&lt;ref name=HebertBirds/&gt;) results reinforce these views and strengthen the case for DNA barcoding. Hebert ''et al.'' also proposed a standard sequence threshold to define new species, this threshold, the so-called "barcoding gap", was defined as 10 times the mean intraspecific variation for the group under study.

===Identification of fish===

An example is the possible identification of [[grouper]]s causing [[Ciguatera]] fish poisoning from meal remnants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schoelinck C, Hinsinger DD, Dettaï A, Cruaud C, Justine JL | title = A phylogenetic re-analysis of groupers with applications for ciguatera fish poisoning | journal = PLOS One | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = e98198 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25093850 | pmc = 4122351 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0098198 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception in 2005 [http://www.fishbol.org FISH-BOL] has been creating a valuable public resource in the form of an electronic database containing DNA barcodes for almost 10000 species, images, and geospatial coordinates of examined specimens.&lt;ref name=BeckerFishBOL&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Becker S, Hanner R, Steinke D | title = Five years of FISH-BOL: brief status report | journal = Mitochondrial DNA | volume = 22 Suppl 1 | pages = 3–9 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21271850 | doi = 10.3109/19401736.2010.535528 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The database contains linkages to voucher specimens, information on species distributions, nomenclature, authoritative taxonomic information, collateral natural history information and literature citations. FISH-BOL thus complements and enhances existing information resources, including the [http://research.calacademy.org/ichthyology/catalog Catalog of Fishes], [http://www.fishbase.org FishBase] and various genomics databases .

===Delimiting cryptic species===

The next major study into the efficacy of DNA barcoding was focused on the [[neotropical]] skipper butterfly, ''[[Astraptes fulgerator]]'' at the [[Area de Conservación Guanacaste World Heritage Site|Area de Conservación de Guanacaste]] (ACG) in north-western [[Costa Rica]]. This species was already known as a [[cryptic species complex]], due to subtle [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] differences, as well as an unusually large variety of [[caterpillar]] food plants. However, several years would have been required for taxonomists to completely delimit species. Hebert ''et al.'' (2004b&lt;ref name=HebertAstraptes&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hebert PD, Penton EH, Burns JM, Janzen DH, Hallwachs W | title = Ten species in one: DNA barcoding reveals cryptic species in the neotropical skipper butterfly Astraptes fulgerator | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 101 | issue = 41 | pages = 14812–7 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15465915 | pmc = 522015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0406166101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) sequenced the COI gene of 484 specimens from the ACG. This sample included "at least 20 individuals reared from each species of food plant, extremes and intermediates of adult and caterpillar color variation, and representatives" from  the three major ecosystems where ''Astraptes fulgerator'' is found. Hebert ''et al.'' (2004b&lt;ref name=HebertAstraptes/&gt;) concluded that ''Astraptes fulgerator'' consists of 10 different species in north-western Costa Rica. These results, however, were subsequently challenged by Brower (2006&lt;ref name=Brower&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brower AVZ |title=Problems with DNA barcodes for species delimitation: 'ten species' of ''Astraptes fulgerator'' reassessed (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) |journal=Systematics and Biodiversity |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=127–32 |year=2006 |doi=10.1017/S147720000500191X }}&lt;/ref&gt;), who pointed out numerous serious flaws in the analysis, and concluded that the original data could support no more than the possibility of three to seven cryptic [[taxa]] rather than ten cryptic species. This highlights that the results of DNA barcoding analyses can be dependent upon the choice of analytical methods used by the investigators, so the process of delimiting cryptic species using DNA barcodes can be as subjective as any other form of taxonomy.

A more recent example used DNA barcoding for the identification of cryptic species included in the ongoing long-term database of tropical caterpillar life generated by Dan Janzen and Winnie Hallwachs in Costa Rica at the ACG.&lt;ref name=caterpillar&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Janzen DH, Hallwachs W |url=http://janzen.sas.upenn.edu/caterpillars/database.lasso |title=Dynamic database for an inventory of the macrocaterpillar fauna, and its food plants and parasitoids |year=2009 |website=Area de Conservacion Guanacaste (ACG), northwestern Costa Rica |access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006 Smith ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Smith2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith MA, Woodley NE, Janzen DH, Hallwachs W, Hebert PD | title = DNA barcodes reveal cryptic host-specificity within the presumed polyphagous members of a genus of parasitoid flies (Diptera: Tachinidae) | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 103 | issue = 10 | pages = 3657–62 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16505365 | pmc = 1383497 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0511318103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; examined whether a COI DNA barcode could function as a tool for identification and discovery for the 20 morphospecies of ''[[Belvosia]]'' [https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=650659] [[parasitoid]] flies ([[Tachinidae]]) that have been reared from [[caterpillar]]s in ACG. Barcoding not only discriminated among all 17 highly host-specific morphospecies of ACG ''Belvosia'', but it also suggested that the species count could be as high as 32 by indicating that each of the three generalist species might actually be arrays of highly host-specific cryptic species.

In 2007 Smith ''et al.'' expanded on these results by barcoding 2,134 flies belonging to what appeared to be the 16 most generalist of the ACG tachinid morphospecies.&lt;ref name=Smith2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith MA, Wood DM, Janzen DH, Hallwachs W, Hebert PD | title = DNA barcodes affirm that 16 species of apparently generalist tropical parasitoid flies (Diptera, Tachinidae) are not all generalists | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 12 | pages = 4967–72 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17360352 | pmc = 1821123 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0700050104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They encountered 73 mitochondrial lineages separated by an average of 4% sequence divergence and, as these lineages are supported by collateral ecological information, and, where tested, by independent nuclear markers (28S and ITS1), the authors therefore viewed these lineages as provisional species. Each of the 16 initially apparent generalist species were categorized into one of four patterns: (i) a single generalist species, (ii) a pair of morphologically cryptic generalist species, (iii) a complex of specialist species plus a generalist, or (iv) a complex of specialists with no remaining generalist. In sum, there remained 9 generalist species classified among the 73 mitochondrial lineages analyzed.

However, also in 2007, Whitworth ''et al.'' reported that flies in the related family [[Calliphoridae]] could not be discriminated by barcoding.&lt;ref name=Whitworthetal/&gt; They investigated the performance of barcoding in the fly genus ''[[Protocalliphora]]'', known to be infected with the [[endosymbiotic]] bacteria ''[[Wolbachia]]''. Assignment of unknown individuals to species was impossible for 60% of the species, and if the technique had been applied, as in the previous study, to identify new species, it would have underestimated the species number in the genus by 75%. They attributed the failure of barcoding to the non-monophyly of many of the species at the mitochondrial level; in one case, individuals from four different species had identical barcodes. The authors went on to state: {{quote|The pattern of ''Wolbachia'' infection strongly suggests that the lack of within-species monophyly results from introgressive hybridization associated with ''Wolbachia'' infection. Given that ''Wolbachia'' is known to infect between 15 and 75% of insect species, we conclude that identification at the species level based on mitochondrial sequence might not be possible for many insects.&lt;ref name=Whitworthetal/&gt;}}

Mwabvu ''et al.'' (2013) observed a high level of divergence (19.09% for CO1, 520 base pairs) between two morphologically indistinguishable populations of ''Bicoxidens flavicollis'' [[millipede]]s in [[Zimbabwe]], and suggested the presence of cryptic species in ''Bicoxidens flavicollis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mwabvu T, Lamb J, Slotow R, Hamer M, Barraclough D | date = 2013 | title = Is millipede taxonomy based on gonopod morphology too inclusive?

Marine biologists have also considered the value of the technique in identifying cryptic and polymorphic species and have suggested that the technique may be helpful when associations with voucher specimens are maintained,&lt;ref name="schander2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schander C, Willassen E |title=What can Biological Barcoding do for Marine Biology? |journal=Marine Biology Research |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=79–83 |year=2005 |doi=10.1080/17451000510018962 |url=http://www.bolinfonet.org/pdf/schander&amp;willassen_2005.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620165057/http://www.bolinfonet.org/pdf/schander%26willassen_2005.pdf |archive-date=2006-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though cases of "shared barcodes" (e.g., non-unique) have been documented in [[cichlid]] fishes and [[cowries]]&lt;ref name =Meier/&gt;

===Cataloguing ancient life===

Lambert ''et al.'' (2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lambert DM, Baker A, Huynen L, Haddrath O, Hebert PD, Millar CD | title = Is a large-scale DNA-based inventory of ancient life possible? | journal = The Journal of Heredity | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 279–84 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15731217 | doi = 10.1093/jhered/esi035 | url = http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/96/3/279.pdf | format = PDF fulltext }}&lt;/ref&gt;) examined the possibility of using DNA barcoding to assess the past diversity of the Earth's [[biota (ecology)|biota]]. The COI gene of a group of extinct [[ratite]] birds, the [[moa]], were sequenced using 26 [[subfossil]] moa bones. As with Hebert's results, each species sequenced had a unique barcode and intraspecific COI sequence variance ranged from 0 to 1.24%. To determine new species, a standard sequence threshold of 2.7% COI sequence difference was set. This value is 10 times the average intraspecies difference of North American birds, which is inconsistent with Hebert's recommendation that the threshold value be based on the group under study. Using this value, the group detected six moa species. In addition, a further standard sequence threshold of 1.24% was also used. This value resulted in 10 moa species which corresponded with the previously known species with one exception. This exception suggested a possible complex of species which was previously unidentified. Given the slow rate of growth and reproduction of moa, it is probable that the interspecies variation is rather low. On the other hand, there is no set value of molecular difference at which populations can be assumed to have irrevocably started to undergo [[speciation]]. It is safe to say, however, that the 2.7% COI sequence difference initially used was far too high.

===The Moorea Biocode Project===

The [http://www.mooreabiocode.org/ Moorea Biocode Project] is a barcoding initiative to create the first comprehensive inventory of all non-microbial life in a complex tropical ecosystem, the island of [[Moorea]] in Tahiti. Supported by a grant from the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]], the Moorea Biocode Project is a 3-year project that brings together researchers from the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[UC Berkeley]], France’s [[CNRS|National Center for Scientific Research]] (CNRS), and other partners. The outcome of the project is a library of genetic markers and physical identifiers for every species of plant, animal and fungi on the island that will be provided as a publicly available database resource for ecologists and evolutionary biologists around the world.

The software back-end to the Moore Biocode Project is [[Geneious|Geneious Pro]] and two custom-developed plugins from the [[New Zealand]]-based company, [[Biomatters]]. The [http://software.mooreabiocode.org/index.php?title=Main_Page|Geneious Biocode LIMS and Genbank Submission] plugins have been made freely available to the public&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bio-itworld.com/2010/11/30/biomatters-moorea-LIMS.html |author=Allison Proffitt |date=November 30, 2010 |title=LIMS Made Freely Available to DNA Barcoding Community |website=Bio-IT World}}&lt;/ref&gt; and users of the free Geneious Basic software will be able to access and view the Biocode database upon completion of the project, while a commercial copy of Geneious Pro is required for researchers involved in data creation and analysis.

==Initial criticism and current status==
In the initial years following its proposal, DNA barcoding met with spirited reaction from scientists, especially [[systematics|systematists]], ranging from enthusiastic endorsement to vociferous opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rubinoff D, Cameron S, Will K | title = A genomic perspective on the shortcomings of mitochondrial DNA for "barcoding" identification | journal = The Journal of Heredity | volume = 97 | issue = 6 | pages = 581–94 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17135463 | doi = 10.1093/jhered/esl036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebach MC, Carvalho MR |year=2010 |title=Anti-intellectualism in the DNA Barcoding Enterprise |journal=Zoologia (Curitiba) |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=165–178 |url=http://scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1984-46702010000200003 |doi=10.1590/s1984-46702010000200003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, some stressed the fact that DNA barcoding does not provide reliable information above the species level{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}, while others opined that it was inapplicable at the species level, but may still have merit for higher-level groups.&lt;ref name = Whitworthetal/&gt; Others resented what they saw as a gross oversimplification of the science of taxonomy. And, more practically, some suggested that recently diverged species might not be distinguishable on the basis of their COI sequences.&lt;ref name="pmid18784793"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerr KC, Stoeckle MY, Dove CJ, Weigt LA, Francis CM, Hebert PD | title = Comprehensive DNA barcode coverage of North American birds | journal = Molecular Ecology Notes | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 535–543 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 18784793 | pmc = 2259444 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-8286.2007.01670.x | url = https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/21643/vz_men0007-0535.PMC2259444.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an early study, Funk &amp; Omland (2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Funk DJ, Omland KE |title=Species-level paraphyly and polyphyly: frequency, causes, and consequences, with insights from animal mitochondrial DNA |journal=Annu Rev Ecol Syst |volume=34 |pages=397–423 |year=2003 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132421 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) found that some 23% of animal species were [[polyphyletic]] if their mtDNA data were accurate, indicating that using an mtDNA barcode to assign a species name to an animal would be ambiguous or erroneous in those cases (see also Meyer &amp; Paulay, 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meyer CP, Paulay G | title = DNA barcoding: error rates based on comprehensive sampling | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 12 | pages = e422 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16336051 | pmc = 1287506 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030422 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Some studies with insects suggested an equal or even greater error rate, due to the frequent lack of correlation between the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear genome or the lack of a barcoding gap (e.g., Hurst and Jiggins, 2005,&lt;ref name=Hurstetal/&gt; Whitworth ''et al.'', 2007,&lt;ref name=Whitworthetal/&gt; Wiemers &amp; Fiedler, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiemers M, Fiedler K | title = Does the DNA barcoding gap exist? - a case study in blue butterflies (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) | journal = Frontiers in Zoology | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 8 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17343734 | pmc = 1838910 | doi = 10.1186/1742-9994-4-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Moritz and Cicero (2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moritz C, Cicero C | title = DNA barcoding: promise and pitfalls | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 10 | pages = e354 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15486587 | pmc = 519004 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020354 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;) questioned the efficacy of DNA barcoding by suggesting that other avian data is inconsistent with Hebert ''et al.'''s interpretation, namely, Johnson and Cicero's (2004&lt;ref name=JohnsonCicero&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson NK, Cicero C | title = New mitochondrial DNA data affirm the importance of Pleistocene speciation in North American birds | journal = Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume = 58 | issue = 5 | pages = 1122–30 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15212392 | doi = 10.1554/03-283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) finding that 74% of sister species comparisons fall below the 2.7% threshold suggested by Hebert ''et al.'' These criticisms are somewhat misleading considering that, of the 39 species comparisons reported by Johnson and Cicero, only 8 actually use COI data to arrive at their conclusions. Johnson and Cicero (2004&lt;ref name=JohnsonCicero/&gt;) have also claimed to have detected bird species with identical DNA barcodes, however, these 'barcodes' refer to an unpublished 723-bp sequence of ND6 which has never been suggested as a likely candidate for DNA barcoding.

The criticisms given above date from the first few years following Hebert's initial (2003) papers in which the method was proposed. Writing in 2016, with 13 years elapsed since their initial proposal, Hebert and co-workers wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[In animals,] DNA barcodes typically discriminate about 95% of known species; cases of compromised resolution involve sister taxa, often species that hybridize. In the many taxa where geographical variation in barcode sequences is small, a few records per species are sufficient to create an effective identification system. However, the analysis of more specimens is advantageous because it often reveals discordances that indicate misidentifications or cryptic taxa, and it also provides insights into the extent of geographical variation in barcode sequences. There are two animal phyla in which COI often fails to deliver species-level resolution, sponges and some benthic cnidarians, apparently because of their slowed rates of mitochondrial evolution. Barcoding also fails to distinguish a small fraction of species in other groups, typically sister taxa or those whose status is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hebert PD, Hollingsworth PM, Hajibabaei M | title = From writing to reading the encyclopedia of life | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume = 371 | issue = 1702 | pages = 20150321 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27481778 | pmc = 4971178 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2015.0321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a more recent (2018) review, M. Stoeckle and D. Thaler write:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The current field of COI barcodes is no longer fragile but neither is it complete. As of late 2016 there were close to five million COI barcodes between the GenBank and BOLD databases. Objections can now be seen in the cumulative light of these data and more than a decade’s experience. There is no longer any doubt that DNA barcodes are useful and practical. The agreement with specialists encompasses most cases in several important animal domains. Many cases where DNA barcodes and domain specialists do not agree reflect geographic splits within species or hybridization between species. Others upon further investigation been attributed to mislabeling or sequence error. Some may represent ''bona fide'' exceptions to the rule that mitochondrial sequence clusters coincide with species defined by other means. In the great majority of cases COI barcodes yield a close approximation of what specialists come up with after a lot of study. Birds are one of the best characterized of all animal groups and COI barcode clusters have been tabulated as agreeing with expert taxonomy for 94% of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stoeckle MY, Thaler DS | title = Why should mitochondria define species? | journal = Human Evolution | volume = 33 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 1–30 | date = 2018 |doi=10.14673/HE2018121037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As noted above, the current status of barcoding for vascular plants is presently both less settled and less effective than for animals. In a recent study covering most (96%) of the 5108 vascular plant species known from Canada, the three barcode markers tested (matK, ITS2 and rbcL) were all effective at discriminating genera (98%, 97% and 91%, respectively); at species level, matK delivered the highest discrimination (81%) followed by ITS2 (72%) and rbcL (44%), however the effectiveness of matK was also variable by biogeographic region, varying from 69%-87% according to the geographic origin of the plants concerned. Resolution also varied by family, with the poorest species discrimination within Canadian species of Salicaceae, Asteraceae and Fabaceae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Braukmann TW, Kuzmina ML, Sills J, Zakharov EV, Hebert PD | title = Testing the Efficacy of DNA Barcodes for Identifying the Vascular Plants of Canada | journal = PLOS One | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = e0169515 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28072819 | pmc = 5224991 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0169515 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of this study did not report on the combined efficacy of either any two, or all three markers, in part due to sampling limitations, but commented that although ITS2 showed slightly lower performance, it had two important advantages (its short length making it suitable for high-throughput sequencing (HTS)-based applications, and it is readily recovered from diverse taxa, including vascular plants and fungi), and looked forward to the development of more comprehensive reference libraries of both matK and ITS2 to further assist in the identification of unknown samples.

==Software==
Software for DNA barcoding requires integration of a field information management system (FIMS), laboratory information management system (LIMS), sequence analysis tools, workflow tracking to connect field data and laboratory data, database submission tools and pipeline automation for scaling up to eco-system scale projects. [[Geneious|Geneious Pro]] can be used for the sequence analysis components, and the two plugins made freely available through the Moorea Biocode Project, the [http://software.mooreabiocode.org/index.php?title=Main_Page|Geneious Biocode LIMS and Genbank Submission] plugins handle integration with the FIMS, the LIMS, workflow tracking and database submission.

The [[Barcode of Life Data Systems]] (BOLD) is a web based workbench and database supporting the acquisition, storage, analysis, and publication of DNA barcode records. By assembling molecular, morphological, and distributional data, it bridges a traditional bioinformatics chasm. BOLD is the most prominently used barcoding software and is freely available to any researcher with interests in DNA barcoding. By providing specialized services, it aids the assembly of records that meet the standards needed to gain BARCODE designation in the global sequence databases. Because of its web-based delivery and flexible data security model, it is also well positioned to support projects that involve broad research alliances.

'''''Die Knoff-Hoff-Show''''' was a comedy science TV show on the German public broadcaster [[ZDF]]. The original series was broadcast between 1986 and 1999; it returned as ''Die große Knoff-Hoff-Show'' in 2002–04. The name is a [[Cacography|joke German pronunciation]] of the English expression [[know-how]].

== Concept ==
The concept of the show was developed in the mid-1980s by {{Interlanguage link multi|Joachim Bublath|de}}, a TV presenter trained as a physicist. He was a presenter in all episodes. His co-presenters were {{Interlanguage link multi|Ramona Leiß|de}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Babette Einstmann|de}}, [[Monica Lierhaus]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Kim Fisher|de}}.

The show explained scientific concepts by means of simple experiments that anyone could replicate. In addition, hobbyists were given the opportunity to present their inventions; these included a [[pretzel]]-cutting machine and a foam-throwing machine. Each week, the show included some "crazy" experiments by Knoff-Hoff Professor Charlie (played by Egon Keresztes); these were so absurd, they frequently went wrong.

The ''Veterinary Street Jazz Band'' played the theme tune, an interpretation of the 1927 song "[[Ain’t She Sweet]]", first recorded by {{Interlanguage link multi|Lou Gold &amp; His Orchestra|de}}, at the start and end of the program, and also brief musical interludes between segments.

''Die Knoff-Hoff-Show'' rapidly became one of the most successful science shows on German television. It was [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in nine languages and shown on other continents.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== History ==
The show aired for the first time on February 16, 1986, and ended with Episode 79 on March 21, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drillingsraum.de/joachim_bublath/joachim_bublath_3.html "Interview Joachim Bublath – Die Knoff-Hoff-Show – Wie alles begann"], ''Drillingsraum'', December 29, 2008, page 3 of 6 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2002 ZDF broadcast a second series, titled ''Die große Knoff-Hoff-Show'' (The Big Knoff-Hoff Show); this ended in December 2004. According to Bublath, it was canceled because it proved impossible to keep up the pace of experiments ("a new experiment every minute").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drillingsraum.de/joachim_bublath/joachim_bublath_4.html "Interview Joachim Bublath – Die Knoff-Hoff-Show – Hinter den Kulissen"], ''Drillingsraum'', December 29, 2008, page 4 of 6: "wir haben jede Minute ein neues Experiment gestartet".&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also two special broadcasts in summer 2005 under the title ''Der Sommer mit Knoff-Hoff'' (Summer with Knoff-Hoff).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5627">'''Earth Expeditions''' is a global education and conservation program offering graduate courses worldwide. The program was created by Project ''Dragonfly'' at [[Miami University]] in Oxford, Ohio. Earth Expeditions courses also count toward a master's degree in global leadership, education, and environmental stewardship through the Global Field Program (GFP).

== Brief history and courses==

The "Earth Expeditions" program began in 2003 as a global education and conservation initiative from Miami University. Earth Expeditions graduate courses can be used toward a Master of Arts in Teaching in the Biological Sciences or a Master of Arts in Biology from Miami. Example Earth Expeditions graduate courses:&lt;ref&gt;Myers et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==

The mission of Earth Expeditions is to build an alliance of people with direct knowledge of inquiry-driven, community-based learning for the benefit of ecological communities, student achievement, and global understanding.
The image of people who merely transmit and receive knowledge from books is of limited usefulness in an era of rapid social, environmental and technological change. This program envisions each person as an ambassador who creates and transmits knowledge and who promotes authentic dialogue at all levels of society, inspiring others to do the same. With the adoption of participatory models of education, schools become centers of investigation, students engage more deeply in their studies, and communities achieve higher levels of self-determination.

== Project ''Dragonfly'' ==

Since its inception nearly 20 years ago, '''Project ''Dragonfly''''' has reached millions of children, parents and educators through [[science learning]] media, exhibits, and graduate programs. The project began in 1994 with the creation of the award-winning ''Dragonfly'' magazine, the first national magazine to feature the investigations and discoveries of children.  Created in 1994 at [[Miami University]], ''Dragonfly'' magazine was funded by NSF and published by the [[National Science Teachers Association]]. Through mid-2000, the magazine published young investigators alongside such adult researchers as Dr. [[Jane Goodall]].

Project ''Dragonfly'' pioneered the "Real Kids, Real Science" approach to learning and continues to work for inquiry-driven reform to increase public involvement in science and global understanding. In addition to Earth Expeditions, Project ''Dragonfly'' worked with [[Twin Cities Public Television|TPT]] Public Television to launch the Emmy-Award winning PBS children's television series ''[[DragonflyTV]]'', which led to the 2010 launch of the spinoff series ''[[SciGirls]]'', both produced by TPT Public Television.  Project ''Dragonfly'' also oversees two national exhibit projects: Wild Research and iSaveSpecies, which are creating public research stations at zoos and aquariums nationwide to engage families in science inquiry and conservation action. The [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) has called ''Dragonfly'' "A true innovation and a model of what active learning should be."

==  Founding partners ==

===  Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden ===

[[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden]] opened in 1875 and is the second oldest zoo in the nation. This national historical landmark hosts more than 500 animal species and 3,000 plant species. More than 1.2 million people visit the Cincinnati Zoo annually. A non-profit entity, the zoo is internationally known for its success in the protection and propagation of plants and animals in danger and engages in research and conservation projects around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5362">An '''empirical statistical law''' or (in popular terminology) a '''law of statistics''' represents a type of behaviour that has been found across a number of datasets and, indeed, across a range of types of data sets.&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher &amp; Salmon (2009) p.51&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these observances have been formulated and proved as statistical or probabilistic theorems and the term "law" has been carried over to these theorems. There are other statistical  and probabilistic theorems that also have "law" as a part of their names that have not obviously derived from empirical observations. However, both types of "law" may be considered instances of a [[scientific law]] in the field of [[statistics]]. What distinguishes an empirical statistical law from a formal statistical theorem is the way these patterns simply appear in natural distributions, without a prior theoretical reasoning about the data. 

== Examples ==
There are several such popular "laws of statistics". 

The [[Pareto principle]] is a popular example of such a "law". It states that roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes, and is thusly also known as the 80/20 rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/03/business/03juran.html|title=Joseph Juran, 103, Pioneer in Quality Control, Dies|last=Bunkley|first=Nick|date=2008-03-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-05|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In business, the 80/20 rule says that 80% of your business comes from just 20% of your customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/80-20-rule.asp|title=80-20 Rule|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2010-11-04|work=Investopedia|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In software engineering, it's often said that 80% of the errors are caused by just 20% of the bugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.crn.com/news/security/18821726/microsofts-ceo-80-20-rule-applies-to-bugs-not-just-features.htm?itc=refresh|title=Microsoft's CEO: 80-20 Rule Applies To Bugs, Not Just Features|last=Rooney|first=Paula|date=2002-10-03|work=CRN|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20% of the world creates roughly 80% of worldwide GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=1992 Human Development Report|last=|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=United Nations Development Program|year=1992|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 80% of healthcare expenses in the US are caused by 20% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 2006|title=Percent of Total Health Care Expenses Incurred by Different Percentiles of U.S. Population: 2002|url=https://archive.ahrq.gov/research/findings/factsheets/costs/expriach/expriach1.html|journal=Research in Action|volume=Issue 19|pages=Figure 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zipf's law]], described as an "empirical statistical law" of [[linguistics]],&lt;ref&gt;Gelbukh &amp; Sidorov (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; is another example. According to the "law", given some dataset of text, the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its frequency rank. In other words, the second most common word should appear about half as often as the most common word, and the fifth most common world would appear about once every five times the most common word appears. However, what sets Zipf's law as an "empirical statistical law" rather than just a theorem of linguistics is that it applies to phenomena outside of its field, too. For example, a ranked list of US metropolitan populations also follow Zipf's law,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gabaix|first=Xavier|date=2011|title=The Area and Population of Cities: New Insights from a Different Perspective on Cities|url=http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~xgabaix/papers/zipf.pdf|journal=American Economic Review|volume=vol 101(5)|pages=2205–2225}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even [[forgetting]] follows Zipf's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=John R.|last2=Schooler|first2=Lael J.|date=November 1991|title=Reflections of the Environment in Memory|url=http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/37JRA_LS_PS_1991.pdf|journal=Psychological Science|volume= 2| issue =  6|pages=396–408|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1991.tb00174.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act of summarizing several natural data patterns with simple rules is a defining characteristic of these "empirical statistical laws". 

Examples of empirically inspired statistical laws that have a firm theoretical basis include:
:*[[Statistical regularity]]
:*[[Law of large numbers]]
:*[[Law of truly large numbers]]
:*[[Central limit theorem]]
:*[[Regression towards the mean]]

Examples of "laws" with a weaker foundation include: 
:*[[Safety in numbers]]
:*[[Benford's law]]

Examples of "laws" which are more general observations than having a theoretical background:
:*[[Rank-size distribution]]

Examples of supposed "laws" which are incorrect include:
:*[[Law of averages]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2366">The '''enthalpy of neutralization''' ('''Δ''H''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''') is the change in [[enthalpy]] that occurs when one equivalent of an [[acid]] and one equivalent of a [[Base (chemistry)|base]] undergo a [[neutralization reaction]] to form [[water]] and a [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]. It is a special case of the [[enthalpy of reaction]]. It is defined as the energy released with the formation of 1 mole of water.

When a reaction is carried out under [[standard conditions]] at the temperature of 298 K (25 degrees Celsius) and 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] of pressure and one mole of water is formed it is called the ''standard enthalpy of neutralization'' ('''Δ''H''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;⊖&lt;/sup&gt;''').

The heat (''Q'') released during a reaction is
:&lt;math&gt; Q = mc_{p} \Delta T &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mass of the solution, ''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[specific heat capacity]] of the solution, and ∆''T'' is the [[temperature]] change observed during the reaction. From this, the standard enthalpy change (∆H) is obtained by division with the amount of substance (in [[mole (chemistry)|moles]]) involved.

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta H = - \frac{Q}{n} &lt;/math&gt;
When a [[strong acid]], HA, reacts with a [[strong base]], BOH, the reaction that occurs is
:&lt;chem&gt;H+ + OH^- -&gt; H2O&lt;/chem&gt;    
as the acid and the base are fully dissociated and neither the cation B&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; nor the anion A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are involved in the neutralization reaction. The enthalpy change for this reaction  is -57.62 kJ/mol at 25°C.

For weak acids or bases, the heat of neutralization is pH dependent. In the absence of any added mineral acid or alkali some heat is required for complete dissociation. The total heat evolved during neutralization will be smaller.

:e.g. &lt;math chem&gt;\ce{HCN + NaOH -&gt; NaCN + H2O};\ \Delta H = -12 \mathrm{kJ/mol}&lt;/math&gt; at 25°C

The heat of ionization for this reaction is equal to (–12 + 57.3) = 45.3 kJ/mol at 25°C.&lt;ref name="Community College of Rhode Island"&gt;{{cite web|title=Enthalpy of Neutralization|url=http://faculty.ccri.edu/aahughes/GenChemII/Lab%20Experiments/Enthalpy_of_Neutralization.pdf|publisher=Community College of Rhode Island|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause and significance==
[[Image:Kepler_Observatory_Linz_under_the_Stars.jpg|thumb|Sirius is the present star with the greatest [[apparent magnitude]] (after the sun) and one which is almost non-variable. The [[Pleiades]], a key feature of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] shown across [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] in the same photograph also experience an annual period of visibility ("rising and setting").]]
Relative to the other stars, the sun appears to drift eastward (about {{frac|1|365.24219}} of Earth's orbit—hence almost one degree—per solar day) along a path called the [[ecliptic]] (specifically appearing in front of 13 constellations considered the [[zodiac]] constellations from a total of [[88 modern constellations]]) which is, by definition, the plane of the earth's orbit.  While the sun appears in front of (or south or north of) a relatively small group of stars they can no longer be seen either before dawn, during daytime or after sunset{{efn|except as to those directly north and south of it can be observed in a full [[solar eclipse]] or other rare conditions e.g. near the poles in the very early or late day}} &amp;mdash; their appearance coincides with that of the sun above the [[horizon]].  Depending on the observer's latitude many stars are subject to annual heliacal risings and settings.  Rising means the local latitude of the earth has moved along its orbit such that the star, star cluster or galaxy emerges for part of the year to within months be visible for the whole night and then for the early portion of the night. Thus the star's first emergence, an annual rise, is immediately before dawn. The risen status of each star is easiest considered day-on-day in the [[tropics]] where the time of dawn varies less. The rising of a star which has had its annual rising ("heliacal rising"), typically over months, rises earlier at night and so at dawn figures more toward its annual highest point (meridian) and then in later dawns more toward the west all by about {{frac|1|182}}th of its arc (about {{frac|1|365}} of the circle) per day, until, observing the western sky after sunset, it has already disappeared. This is called the ''cosmical setting''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sizes.com/time/risesetstar.htm rising and setting of stars]&lt;/ref&gt; The same star will reappear in the eastern sky at dawn approximately one year after its previous rising. For zodiac and near-zodiac constellations (near the [[ecliptic]], the apparent daily path of the sun), Earth's [[precession of the equinoxes|precession]] means the date of their rising decreases gradually, completing one cycle in about 26,000 years (for example at the March Equinox, the position of the Sun relative the stars &amp;mdash; at which Right Ascension is calibrated as zero, the [[First Point of Aries]], is in the preceding constellation of Pisces.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeoastronomy.wordpress.com/2005/09/10/archaic-astronomy-and-heliacal-rising/ Archaic Astronomy and Heliacal Rising]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-application to circumpolar stars at extra-tropical latitudes==
Some stars, when viewed from [[latitude]]s outside of the tropics on Earth, do not rise or set. These are [[circumpolar star]]s, which are either always in the sky or never.  For example, the [[North Star]] (Polaris) is not visible in Australia and the [[Southern Cross]] is not seen in Europe, because they always stay below the respective horizons.  

The term ''circumpolar'' is somewhat localised as between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator, the Southern polar constellations have a brief spell of annual visibility (thus "heliacal" rising and "cosmic" setting) and the same applies as to the other polar constellations in respect of the reverse tropic.

== History ==
Constellations containing stars that rise and set were incorporated into early [[calendar]]s or [[zodiac]]s. The [[Sumer]]ians, [[Babylonia]]ns, [[ancient Egyptians|Egyptians]], and [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] all used the heliacal risings of various stars for the timing of agricultural activities.

Because of its position about 40° off the ecliptic, the heliacal risings of the bright star [[Sirius]] occur over a "Sothic year" almost exactly synchronized with the [[solar year]].{{efn|The [[Sothic year]] is about a minute longer than a [[solar year]].&lt;ref name=teacosy&gt;{{harvp|Tetley|2014|p=[http://www.egyptchronology.com/uploads/2/6/9/4/26943741/ch_3_investigating_ancient_egyptian_calendars.pdf 42]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Since the development of [[civilization]], this has occurred at [[Cairo]] on July 19 on the [[Julian calendar]].&lt;ref name=lavia/&gt;{{efn|The exact date varies with [[latitude]], so that Sirius's return is observed about 8–10 days later on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast than at [[Elephantine|Aswan]].&lt;ref name=teatime&gt;{{citation |last=Tetley |first=M. Christine |title=The Reconstructed Chronology of the Egyptian Kings, ''Vol. I'' |url=http://www.egyptchronology.com/vols-1--2.html |date=2014 |p=[http://www.egyptchronology.com/uploads/2/6/9/4/26943741/ch_3_investigating_ancient_egyptian_calendars.pdf 43] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Official observations were made at [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] or [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] near [[Cairo]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], and [[Elephantine]] near [[Aswan]].&lt;ref name=teatime/&gt; The date at any location also slowly varies within the [[Gregorian calendar]], owing to its omission of three leap years every four centuries. It presently occurs on 3 August.&lt;ref name=lavia&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.lavia.org/english/archivo/egyptiancalendaren.html |contribution=Ancient Egyptian Civil Calendar |title=La Via |url=http://www.lavia.org/indexIT.html |accessdate=8 February 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Its returns also roughly corresponded to the onset of the [[flooding of the Nile|annual flooding]] of the [[Nile]] before it was ended by the [[Aswan Low Dam|Aswan Low]] and [[Aswan High Dam|High Dams]]. The [[ancient Egypt]]ians appear to have constructed their 365-day [[Egyptian calendar|civil calendar]] at a time when Wep Renpet, its [[New Year]], corresponded with Sirius's return to the night sky.&lt;ref name=teacosy/&gt; Although this calendar's lack of [[leap year]]s caused the event to shift one day every four years or so, [[Egyptian astronomy|astronomical records]] of this displacement led to the discovery of the [[Sothic cycle]] and, later, the establishment of the more accurate [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Alexandrian calendar]]s.

The Egyptians also devised a method of telling the time at night based on the heliacal risings of 36 [[Decans|decan stars]], one for each 10° segment of the 360° circle of the zodiac and corresponding to the ten-day "weeks" of their civil calendar.

To the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]], the [[Pleiades]] are called [[Matariki]], and their heliacal rising signifies the beginning of the new year (around June). The [[Mapuche]] of [[South America]] called the Pleiades ''Ngauponi'' which in the vicinity of the ''[[we tripantu]]'' (Mapuche new year) will disappear by the west, ''lafkenmapu'' or ''ngulumapu'', appearing at dawn to the East, a few days before the birth of new life in nature. Heliacal rising of Ngauponi, i.e. appearance of the Pleiades by the horizon over an hour before the Sun approximately 12 days before the winter solstice, announced ''we tripantu''.

When a planet has a heliacal rising, there is a [[Conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] with the sun beforehand. Depending on the type of conjunction, there may be a [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]], [[eclipse]], [[Transit (astronomy)|transit]], or [[occultation]] of the sun.

==Rising at sunset==
The rising of a planet above the eastern horizon at [[sunset]] is called its ''acronychal rising'', which for a [[superior planet]] signifies an [[opposition (planets)|opposition]], another type of [[syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]]. 

When the Moon has an acronychal rising, it will occur near [[full moon]] and thus, in a small number of cases, a noticeable [[lunar eclipse]].

'''Herbert George Baker''' (February 23, 1920 – July 2, 2001) was a British-American [[botanist]] and [[evolutionary ecology|evolutionary ecologist]] who was an authority on [[pollination biology]] and breeding systems of [[angiosperms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett|first1=Spencer C.

Instead of analyzing the whole structure, hierarchy theory refers to the analysis of hierarchical levels, and the interactions between them.

For 3-dimensional crystals, it may be necessary to combine several views, taken from different angles, into a 3D map. This technique is called [[electron crystallography]].

One of the difficulties with HRTEM is that image formation relies on phase contrast. In [[phase-contrast imaging]], contrast is not necessarily intuitively interpretable, as the image is influenced by aberrations of the imaging lenses in the microscope. The largest contributions for uncorrected instruments typically come from defocus and astigmatism. The latter can be estimated from the so-called Thon ring pattern appearing in the Fourier transform modulus of an image of a thin amorphous film.

==Image contrast and interpretation==
[[File:Simulation GaN.png|thumb|Simulated HREM images for GaN[0001]]]

The contrast of a HRTEM image arises from the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] in the image plane of the [[Wave-particle duality|electron wave]] with itself. Due to our inability to record the phase of an electron wave, only the amplitude in the image plane is recorded. However, a large part of the structure information of the sample is contained in the phase of the electron wave. In order to detect it, the aberrations of the microscope (like defocus) have to be tuned in a way that converts the phase of the wave at the specimen exit plane into amplitudes in the image plane.

The interaction of the electron wave with the crystallographic structure of the sample is complex, but a qualitative idea of the interaction can readily be obtained. Each imaging electron interacts independently with the sample. Above the sample, the wave of an electron can be approximated as a plane wave incident on the sample surface. As it penetrates the sample, it is attracted by the positive atomic potentials of the atom cores, and channels along the atom columns of the crystallographic lattice (s-state model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geuens|first=P|author2=van Dyck, D|title=The S-state model: a work horse for HRTEM.|journal=Ultramicroscopy|date=Dec 2002|volume=3-4|pages=179–98|doi=10.1016/s0304-3991(02)00276-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;). At the same time, the interaction between the electron wave in different atom columns leads to [[Bragg diffraction]]. The exact description of dynamical scattering of electrons in a sample not satisfying the [[weak phase object approximation]] (WPOA), which is almost all real samples, still remains the holy grail of electron microscopy.  However, the physics of electron scattering and electron microscope image formation are sufficiently well known to allow accurate simulation of electron microscope images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v274/n5669/abs/274322a0.html |title=Computed crystal structure images for high resolution electron microscopy|author=O'Keefe, M. A., Buseck, P. R. and S. Iijima|volume=274|series=nature|year=1978|pages=322–324| doi= 10.1038/274322a0 | publisher=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | journal=Nature | issue=5669 | bibcode=1978Natur.274..322O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the interaction with a crystalline sample, the '''electron exit wave''' right below the sample ''φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''','''u''')'' as a function of the spatial coordinate '''''x''''' is a superposition of a plane wave and a multitude of diffracted beams with different in plane [[Spatial frequency|spatial frequencies]] '''''u''''' (spatial frequencies correspond to scattering angles, or distances of rays from the optical axis in a diffraction plane). The phase change ''φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''','''u''')'' relative to the incident wave peaks at the location of the atom columns. The exit wave now passes through the imaging system of the microscope where it undergoes further phase change and interferes as the '''image wave''' in the imaging plane (mostly a digital pixel detector like a CCD camera). It is important to realize, that the recorded image is NOT a direct representation of the samples crystallographic structure. For instance, high intensity might or might not indicate the presence of an atom column in that precise location (see simulation). The relationship between the exit wave and the image wave is a highly nonlinear one and is a function of the aberrations of the microscope. It is described by the ''contrast transfer function''.

===The phase contrast transfer function===

The phase [[contrast transfer function]] (CTF) is a function of limiting apertures and [[Aberration in optical systems|aberrations]] in the imaging lenses of a microscope. It describes their effect on the phase of the exit wave ''φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''','''u''')'' and propagates it to the image wave. Following ''Williams and Carter'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transmission electron microscopy: A textbook for materials science |last=Williams |first=David B. |author2=Carter, C. Barry |year=1996 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |isbn=0-306-45324-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; if we assume the WPOA holds (thin sample) the CTF becomes

: &lt;math&gt;CTF(u)=A(u)E(u)\sin(\chi(u))&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A('''u''')'' is the ''aperture function'', ''E('''u''')'' describes the attenuation of the wave for higher [[spatial frequency]] ''u'', also called ''envelope function''. ''χ('''u''')'' is a function of the aberrations of the electron optical system.

The last, sinusoidal term of the CTF will determine the sign with which components of frequency '''''u''''' will enter contrast in the final image. If one takes into account only spherical aberration to third order and defocus, χ is rotationally symmetric about the optical axis of the microscope and thus only depends on the modulus ''u'' = &amp;#124;'''''u'''''&amp;#124;, given by

: &lt;math&gt;\chi(u)=\frac{\pi}{2}C_s\lambda^3u^4-\pi \Delta f \lambda u^2&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the spherical aberration coefficient, ''λ'' is the electron wavelength, and Δ''f'' is the defocus. In TEM, defocus can easily be controlled and measured to high precision. Thus one can easily alter the shape of the CTF by defocusing the sample. Contrary to optical applications, defocusing can actually increase the precision and interpretability of the micrographs.

The ''aperture function'' cuts off beams scattered above a certain critical angle (given by the objective pole piece for ex), thus effectively limiting the attainable resolution. However it is the ''envelope function'' ''E('''u''')'' which usually dampens the signal of beams scattered at high angles, and imposes a maximum to the transmitted spatial frequency. This maximum determines the highest resolution attainable with a microscope and is known as the information limit. ''E('''u''')'' can be described as a product of single envelopes:

: &lt;math&gt;E(u)=E_s(u)E_c(u)E_d(u)E_v(u)E_D(u),\,&lt;/math&gt;
due to

:''E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;('''u''')'': angular spread of the source
:''E&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;('''u''')'': chromatic aberration
:''E&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;('''u''')'': specimen drift
:''E&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;('''u''')'': specimen vibration
:''E&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;('''u''')'': detector

Specimen drift and vibration can be minimized in a stable environment. It is usually the spherical aberration ''C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' that limits spatial coherency and defines ''E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;('''u''')'' and the chromatic aberration ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'', together with current and voltage instabilities that define the temporal coherency in ''E&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;('''u''')''. These two envelopes determine the information limit by damping the signal transfer in Fourier space with increasing spatial frequency ''u''

: &lt;math&gt;E_s(u) = \exp\left[-\left(\frac{\pi\alpha}{\lambda}\right)^2 \left(\frac{\delta\Chi(u)}{\delta u}\right)^2\right] = \exp\left[-\left(\frac{\pi\alpha}{\lambda}\right)^2(C_s\lambda^3u^3+\Delta f\lambda u)^2\right],&lt;/math&gt;

where α is the semiangle of the pencil of rays illuminating the sample. Clearly, if the wave aberration ('here represented by ''C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' and Δ''f'') vanished, this envelope function would be a constant one. In case of an uncorrected TEM with fixed ''C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', the damping due to this envelope function can be minimized by optimizing the defocus at which the image is recorded (Lichte defocus).

The temporal envelope function can be expressed as

: &lt;math&gt;E_c(u) = \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\pi\lambda\delta\right)^2u^4\right],&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, δ is the focal spread with the chromatic aberration ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' as the parameter:

: &lt;math&gt;\delta = C_c\sqrt{4\left(\frac{\Delta I_\text{obj}}{I_\text{obj}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\Delta E}{V_\text{acc}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\Delta V_\text{acc}}{V_\text{acc}}\right)^2},&lt;/math&gt;

The terms &lt;math&gt;\Delta I_\text{obj}/I_\text{obj}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta V_\text{acc}/V_\text{acc}&lt;/math&gt; represent instabilities in of the total current in the magnetic lenses and the acceleration voltage. &lt;math&gt;\Delta E/V_\text{acc}&lt;/math&gt; is the energy spread of electrons emitted by the source.

The information limit of current state-of-the-art TEMs is well below 1 Å. The '''[[Transmission Electron Aberration-corrected Microscope|TEAM]]''' project at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory resultet in the first TEM to reach an information limit of &lt;0.5 Å in 2009 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TEAM project web page |url=http://ncem.lbl.gov/team/TEAMpage/TEAMpage.html |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the use of a highly stable mechanical and electrical environment, an ultra-bright, monochromated electron source and double-[[Sextupole magnet|hexapole]] aberration correctors.

===Optimum defocus in HRTEM===

[[File:OAM CTF.png|thumb|right|CTF of the OAM microscope]]

Choosing the optimum defocus is crucial to fully exploit the capabilities of an electron microscope in HRTEM mode. However, there is no simple answer as to which one is the best.

In Gaussian focus one sets the defocus to zero, the sample is in focus. As a consequence contrast in the image plane gets its image components from the minimal area of the sample, the contrast is ''localized'' (no blurring and information overlap from other parts of the sample). The CTF now becomes a function that oscillates quickly with ''C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;u&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''. What this means is that for certain diffracted beams with a given spatial frequency ''u'' the contribution to contrast in the recorded image will be reversed, thus making interpretation of the image difficult.

====Scherzer defocus====
In Scherzer defocus, one aims to counter the term in ''u''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; with the parabolic term Δ''fu''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of ''χ''(''u''). Thus by choosing the right defocus value ''Δf'' one flattens ''χ''(''u'') and creates a wide band where low spatial frequencies ''u'' are transferred into image intensity with a similar phase. In 1949, Scherzer found that the optimum defocus depends on microscope properties like the spherical aberration ''C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the accelerating voltage (through ''λ'') in the following way:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta f_\text{Scherzer}=-1.2\sqrt{C_s\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where the factor 1.2 defines the extended Scherzer defocus. For the CM300 at [[National Center for Electron Microscopy|NCEM]], ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.6mm and an accelerating voltage of 300keV (''λ'' = 1.97 pm) ([http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/debrog2.html#c1 Wavelength calculation]) result in ''Δf&lt;sub&gt;Scherzer&lt;/sub&gt; = -41.25&amp;nbsp;nm''.

The point resolution of a microscope is defined as the spatial frequency ''u''&lt;sub&gt;res&lt;/sub&gt; where the CTF crosses the [[abscissa]] for the first time. At Scherzer defocus this value is maximized:

: &lt;math&gt;u_\text{res}(\text{Scherzer})=0.6\lambda^{3/4} C_s^{1/4},&lt;/math&gt;

which corresponds to 6.1&amp;nbsp;nm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; on the CM300. Contributions with a spatial frequency higher than the point resolution can be filtered out with an appropriate aperture leading to easily interpretable images at the cost of a lot of information lost.

====Gabor defocus====
Gabor defocus is used in electron holography where both amplitude and phase of the image wave are recorded. One thus wants to minimize crosstalk between the two. The Gabor defocus can be expressed as a function of the Scherzer defocus as

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta f_\text{Gabor}=0.56\Delta f_\text{Scherzer}&lt;/math&gt;

====Lichte defocus====
To exploit all beams transmitted through the microscope up to the information limit, one relies on a complex method called '''exit wave reconstruction''' which consists in mathematically reversing the effect of the CTF to recover the original exit wave ''φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''','''u''')''. To maximize the information throughput, Hannes Lichte proposed in 1991 a defocus of a fundamentally different nature than the Scherzer defocus: because the dampening of the envelope function scales with the first derivative of ''χ(u)'', Lichte proposed a focus minimizing the modulus of d''χ''(''u'')/d''u''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lichte |first=Hannes | year=1991 |title=Optimum focus for taking electron holograms  |journal=Ultramicroscopy |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=13&amp;ndash;22 |doi=10.1016/0304-3991(91)90105-F  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta f_\text{Lichte}=-0.75 C_s(u_\max\lambda)^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''u''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum transmitted spatial frequency. For the CM300 with an information limit of 0.8 Å Lichte defocus lies at &amp;minus;272&amp;nbsp;nm.

===Exit wave reconstruction===
[[File:Focal series reconstruction.png|thumb|Exit wave reconstruction through focal series]]

To calculate back to ''φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''','''u''')'' the wave in the image plane is back propagated numerically to the sample. If all properties of the microscope are well known, it is possible to recover the real exit wave with very high accuracy.

First however, both phase and amplitude of the electron wave in the image plane must be measured. As our instruments only record amplitudes, an alternative method to recover the phase has to be used. There are two methods in use today:
*'''[[Holography]]''', which was developed by [[Dennis Gabor|Gabor]] expressly for TEM applications, uses a prism to split the beam into a reference beam and a second one passing through the sample. Phase changes between the two are then translated in small shifts of the interference pattern, which allows recovering both phase and amplitude of the interfering wave.
* '''Through focal series method''' takes advantage of the fact that the CTF is focus dependent. A series of about 20 pictures is shot under the same imaging conditions with the exception of the focus which is incremented between each take. Together with exact knowledge of the CTF the series allows for computation of ''φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''','''u''')'' (see figure).

Both methods extend the point resolution of the microscope past the information limit, which is the highest possible resolution achievable on a given machine. The ideal defocus value for this type of imaging is known as Lichte defocus and is usually several hundred nanometers negative.

== Isotropic beacons and their relation to SETI ==
An isotropic beacon can be any transmitter that emits a uniform electromagnetic field. However, the term is most commonly used to describe a transmitter used by a civilization to call attention to itself over interstellar distances.{{cn|date=May 2018}} [[Project Cyclops]] is and was one of the first looks at the theoretical framework of what it would take to create such a device.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

'''Kinesiology''' is the scientific study of human or non-human body movement. Kinesiology addresses physiological, biomechanical, and psychological dynamic principles and mechanisms of movement. Applications of kinesiology to human health (i.e., '''human kinesiology''') include [[biomechanics]] and [[orthopedics]]; strength and conditioning; [[sport psychology]]; methods of rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy; and sport and exercise. Studies of human and animal motion include measures from motion tracking systems, [[electrophysiology]] of muscle and brain activity, various methods for monitoring physiological function, and other behavioral and cognitive research techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Bodo Rosenhahn, Reinhard Klette and Dimitris Metaxas (eds.). Human Motion - Understanding, Modelling, Capture and Animation. Volume 36 in ''Computational Imaging and Vision'', Springer, Dordrecht, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Elgammal, Bodo Rosenhahn, and Reinhard Klette (eds.) Human Motion - Understanding, Modelling, Capture and Animation. 2nd Workshop, in conjunction with ICCV 2007, Rio de Janeiro, ''Lecture Notes in Computer Science'', LNCS 4814, Springer, Berlin, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κίνησις}} ''kínēsis'', "movement" (itself from κινεῖν ''kineîn'', "to move"), and -λογία ''[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]'', "study".

== Basics ==
Kinesiology is the study of human and nonhuman animal-body movements, performance, and function by applying the sciences of [[biomechanics]], [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[psychology]], and [[neuroscience]]. Applications of kinesiology in human-health include physical education teacher, rehabilitation, health and safety, health promotion, workplaces, sport and exercise industries. A bachelor's degree in kinesiology can provide strong preparation for graduate study in biomedical research, as well as in professional programs, such as medicine.

Whereas the term "kinesiologist" is neither a licensed nor professional designation in the United States nor most countries (with the exception of Canada), individuals with training in this area can teach physical education, provide consulting services, conduct research and develop policies related to rehabilitation, human motor performance, [[ergonomics]], and occupational health and safety. In North America, kinesiologists may study to earn a [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Master of Science]], or [[Doctorate of Philosophy]] degree in Kinesiology or a [[Bachelor's degree#Kinesiology|Bachelor of Kinesiology]] degree, while in Australia or New Zealand, they are often conferred an Applied Science (Human Movement) degree (or higher). Many doctoral level faculty in North American kinesiology programs received their doctoral training in related disciplines, such as neuroscience, mechanical engineering, psychology, and physiology.

The world's first kinesiology department was launched in 1967 at the [[University of Waterloo]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahs.uwaterloo.ca/kin/|title=Home - Kinesiology|author=|date=20 August 2012|website=uwaterloo.ca|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021063436/http://www.ahs.uwaterloo.ca/kin/|archivedate=21 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neuroplasticity]] is also a key scientific principle used in kinesiology to describe how movement and changes in the brain are related. The human brain adapts and acquires new motor skills based on this principle, which includes both adaptive and maladaptive brain changes.

=== Motor redundancy ===
[[File:Motor Redundancy Animation.gif|300px|thumb|left|Animation illustrating the concept of motor redundancy: the motor action of bringing the finger in contact with a point in space can be achieved using a wide variety of limb configurations.]]

Motor redundancy is a widely used concept in kinesiology and [[motor control]] which states that, for any task the human body can perform, there are effectively an unlimited number of ways the nervous system could achieve that task.&lt;ref name=Bernstein1967&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bernstein|first=Nikolai|title=The Co-ordination and Regulation of Movement| year=1967|publisher=Permagon Press|location=Long Island City, NY|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; This redundancy appears at multiple levels in the chain of motor execution:

* [[kinematics|Kinematic]] redundancy means that for a desired location of the endpoint (e.g. the hand or finger), there are many configurations of the joints that would produce the same endpoint location in space.
* [[Muscle]] redundancy means that the same net joint [[torque]] could be generated by many different relative contributions of individual muscles.
* [[Motor unit]] redundancy means that for the same net muscle [[force]] could be generated by many different relative contributions of motor units within that muscle.

== Scope of practice ==
In Canada, kinesiology is a professional designation as well as an area of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oka.on.ca/ |title=Welcome to the Ontario Kinesiology Association |publisher=Oka.on.ca |accessdate=2009-07-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924214553/http://www.oka.on.ca/ |archivedate=2008-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the province of Ontario the scope has been officially defined as, "the assessment of human movement and performance and its rehabilitation and management to maintain, rehabilitate or enhance movement and performance" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_07k10_e.htm|title=Law Document English View|author=|date=24 July 2014|website=gov.on.ca|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403094418/http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_07k10_e.htm|archivedate=3 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinesiologists work in a variety of roles as health professionals. They work as rehabilitation providers in hospitals, clinics and private settings working with populations needing care for musculoskeletal, cardiac and neurological conditions. They provide rehabilitation to persons injured at work and in vehicular accidents. Kinesiologists also work as functional assessment specialists, exercise therapists, ergonomists, return to work specialists, case managers and medical legal evaluators. They can be found in hospital, long term care, clinic, work, and community settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hprac.org/en/reports/resources/New_Directions_April_2006_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628061020/http://www.hprac.org/en/reports/resources/New_Directions_April_2006_EN.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-28 |df= }}

&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, kinesiology is applied in areas of health and fitness for all levels of athletes, but more often found with training of elite athletes.

== Licensing and regulation ==

=== Canada ===
In Canada, Kinesiology has been designated a regulated health profession in [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name="hoffman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=S. J.|title=Introduction to Kinesiology|editor=Shirl J.

The [[College of Kinesiologists of Ontario]] achieved proclamation on April 1, 2013, at which time the professional title "Kinesiologist" became protected by law. In Ontario only members of the college may call themselves a Registered Kinesiologist.
Individuals who have earned degrees in kinesiology can work in research, the fitness industry, clinical settings, and in industrial environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cka.ca/kinesiology.php |title=CKA - Canadian Kinesiology Alliance - Alliance Canadienne de Kinésiologie |publisher=Cka.ca |accessdate=2009-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318005051/http://www.cka.ca/kinesiology.php |archivedate=2009-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also work in cardiac rehabilitation, health and safety, hospital and long-term care facilities and community health centers just to name a few.

== History of Kinesiology ==
[[File:NilsPosse.png|600px|thumb|In 1886, Swedish baron Nils Posse (1862-1895) introduced the term Kinesiology in the U.S.A., 1894 he wrote the book "The Special Kinesiology of Educational Gymnastics". Nils Posse was a graduate of the Royal Gymnastic Central Institute in Stockholm, Sweden and founder of the Posse Gymnasium, Boston, MA.]]

[[Royal Central Institute of Gymnastics]] ([[:sv:Gymnastik- och idrottshögskolan|sv]]) G.C.I. was founded 1813 in Stockholm, Sweden by [[Pehr Henrik Ling]]. It was the first [[Physiotherapy]] School in the world, training hundreds of medical gymnasts who spread the Swedish physical therapy around the entire world. 
In 1887, Sweden was the first country in the world to give a national state licence to physiotherapists/physical therapists.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ottosson|first=Anders|date=2010|title=The First Historical Movements of Kinesiology: Scientification in the Borderline between Physical Culture and Medicine around 1850|journal=The International Journal of the History of Sport|volume= 27| issue = 11|pages=1892–1919|doi=10.1080/09523367.2010.491618|pmid=20653114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish medical gymnast and [[kinesiologist]] [[Carl August Georgii]] ([[:sv:August Georgii|sv]]), Professor at the Royal Gymnastic Central Institute GCI in Stockholm, was the one who created and coined the new international word '''Kinesiology''' in 1854.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The term ''Kinesiology'' is a literal translation to Greek+English from the original Swedish word ''Rörelselära'', meaning "Movement Science". It was the foundation of the Medical Gymnastics, the original [[Physiotherapy]] and [[Physical Therapy]], developed during 100 years in Sweden (starting 1813).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
 
The new medical therapy created in Sweden was originally called [[Rörelselära]] ([[:sv:Rörelselära|sv]]), and later in 1854 translated to the new and invented international word "Kinesiology". 
The Kinesiology consisted of nearly 2,000 physical movements and 50 different types of massage therapy techniques. 
They were all used to affect various dysfunctions and even illnesses, not only in the movement apparatus, but also into the internal physiology of man. 
Thus, the original classical and Traditional Kinesiology was not only a system of rehabilitation for the body, or biomechanics like in modern Academic Kinesiology, but also a new therapy for relieving and curing diseases, by affecting the autonomic nervous system, organs and glands in the body.,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sjukgymnasten - vart tog han vägen?

In 1886, the Swedish Medical Gymnast [[Nils Posse]] (1862-1895) introduced the term kinesiology in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/NASSH_Proceedings/NP2005/np2005zq.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911234740/http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/NASSH_Proceedings/NP2005/np2005zq.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nils Posse was a graduate of the Royal Gymnastic Central Institute in Stockholm, Sweden and founder of the Posse Gymnasium in Boston, MA. He was teaching at [[Boston Normal School of Gymnastics]] BNSG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kinesiology.com/image/NilsPosse.png |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107034519/http://kinesiology.com/image/NilsPosse.png |archivedate=2017-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Special Kinesiology Of Educational Gymnastics'' was the first book ever written in the world with the word "Kinesiology" in the title of the book. It was written by Nils Posse and published in Boston, 1894-1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kinesiology.com/|title=Kinesiology.com - manual muscle testing MMT|first=Mac Pompeius Wolontis,|last=www.Kinesiology.com|date=|website=kinesiology.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107072051/http://www.kinesiology.com/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology in Kinesiology ==
Motion capture technology has application in measuring human movement, and thus kinesiology. Historically, motion capture labs have recorded high fidelity data.&lt;ref name="Motion capture"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-01-16|title=Motion capture|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Motion_capture&amp;oldid=820735073|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While accurate and credible, these systems can come at high capital and operational costs. Modern-day systems have increased accessibility to mocap technology.&lt;ref name="Motion capture"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10056">'''Knowledge spillover''' is an exchange of ideas among individuals.&lt;ref name="economy"&gt;Carlino, Gerald A. (2001) [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia|Business Review]] ''[http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/publications/business-review/2001/q4/brq401gc.pdf Knowledge Spillovers: Cities' Role in the New Economy.]'' Q4 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[knowledge management]] [[economics]], knowledge spillovers are [[Rivalry (economics)|non-rival]] [[knowledge market]] [[externality|costs incurred by a party not agreeing to assume the costs]] that has a [[spillover effect]] of stimulating technological improvements in a neighbor through one's own innovation.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe, Adam B.; Trajtenberg, Manuel; Fogarty, Michael S. (May, 2000) [[The American Economic Review]] ''[http://www.nber.org/sloan/jaffe.html Knowledge Spillovers and Patent Citations:Evidence from a Survey of Inventors.]'' Vol. 90, No. 2, Papers and Proceedings of the One Hundred Twelfth Annual Meeting of [[American Economic Association|the American Economic Association]], pp. 215-218.&lt;/ref&gt; Such innovations often come from specialization within an industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romer|first=Paul M.|date=May 1987|title=Growth Based on Increasing Returns Due to Specialization|url=|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=77|issue=2|pages=56–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent, general example of a knowledge spillover could be the collective growth associated with the [[research and development]] of online [[social networking]] tools like [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]], and [[Twitter]].  Such tools have not only created a [[positive feedback loop]], and a host of originally unintended benefits for their users, but have also created an explosion of new software, programming platforms, and conceptual breakthroughs that have perpetuated the development of the industry as a whole.  The advent of online marketplaces, the utilization of user profiles, the widespread democratization of information, and the interconnectivity between tools within the industry have all been products of each tool’s individual developments.  These developments have since spread outside the industry into the mainstream media as news and entertainment firms have developed their own market feedback applications within the tools themselves, and their own versions of online networking tools (e.g. [[CNN]]’s [[iReport]]).

There are two kinds of knowledge spillovers: internal and external. Internal knowledge spillover occurs if there is a positive impact of knowledge between individuals [[wiktionary:within|within]] an organization that produces goods and/or services.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; An external knowledge spillover occurs when the positive impact of knowledge is between individuals [[wiktionary:without|without]] or outside of a production organization.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; Marshall-Arrow-Romer (MAR) spillovers, Porter spillovers and Jacobs spillovers are three types of spillovers.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt;

==MAR spillover==
{{confusing|section|date=August 2015}}
[[Image:CabrilloBusinessPark-1.png|thumb|A business park in [[Santa Barbara County, California]] that may generate MAR spillover]]
MAR spillover has its origins in 1890, where the  [[England|English]] economist [[Alfred Marshall]] developed a theory of knowledge spillovers.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; Knowledge spillovers later were extended by economists [[Kenneth Arrow]] (1962) and [[Paul Romer]] (1986).  In 1992, [[Edward Glaeser]], [[Hedi Kallal]], [[José Scheinkman]], and [[Andrei Shleifer]] pulled together the &lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;arshall-&lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;rrow-&lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt;omer views on knowledge spillovers and accordingly named the view MAR spillover in 1992.&lt;ref name="cities"&gt;Glaeser et al., [http://gsi.adislab.net/docs/Plunket/glaeser92.pdf "Growth in Cities"], Journal of Political Economy, 1992 Vol. 100, No. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Marshall-Arrow-Romer (MAR) spillover view, the proximity of firms within a [[wiktionary:common|common]] industry often affects how well knowledge travels among firms to facilitate innovation and growth.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; The closer the firms are to one another, the greater the MAR spillover.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; The exchange of ideas is largely from employee to employee, in that employees from different firms in an industry exchange ideas about new products and new ways to produce goods.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; The opportunity to exchange ideas that lead to innovations key to new products and improved production methods.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt;

[[Business parks]] are a good example of concentrated businesses that may benefit from MAR spillover.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; Many [[Semiconductor industry|semiconductor firms]] intentionally located their research and development facilities in [[Silicon Valley]] to take advantage of MAR spillover.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; In addition, the [[film industry]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] and elsewhere relies on a geographic concentration of specialists ([[Film director|directors]], [[Film producer|producer]]s, [[screenwriter|scriptwriter]]s, and [[set designer]]s) to bring together narrow aspects of movie-making into a final product.

However, research on the Cambridge IT Cluster (UK) suggests that technological knowledge spillovers might only happen rarely and are less important than other cluster benefits such as labour market pooling.&lt;ref name="techspillovers"&gt;Huber, F., [http://joeg.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/02/01/jeg.lbq058.abstract "Do clusters really matter for innovation practices in Information Technology? Questioning the significance of technological knowledge spillovers "], Journal of Economic Geography, {{doi|10.1093/jeg/lbq058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Porter spillover==
Porter (1990), like MAR, argues that knowledge spillovers in specialized, geographically concentrated industries stimulate growth.  He insists, however, that local competition, as opposed to local monopoly, fosters the pursuit and rapid adoption of innovation.  He gives examples of Italian ceramics and gold jewellery industries, in which hundreds of firms are located together and fiercely compete to innovate since the alternative to innovation is demise.  Porter's externalities are maximized in cities with geographically specialized, competitive industries.&lt;ref name="cities"/&gt;

==Jacobs spillover==
Under the Jacobs spillover view, the proximity of firms from different industries affect how well knowledge travels among firms to facilitate innovation and growth.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; This is in contrast to MAR spillovers, which focus on firms in a common industry.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt; The [[diversity (business)|diverse]] proximity of a Jacobs spillover brings together ideas among individuals with different perspectives to encourage an exchange of ideas and foster innovation in an industrially diverse environment.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt;

Developed in 1969 by urbanist [[Jane Jacobs]] and  John Jackson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JohnJackson {{!}} Profile |url=http://media.cla.auburn.edu/economics/people/display.cfm?PersonID=2749 |work=Auburn University Department of Economics Staff Profile |accessdate=28 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501124426/http://media.cla.auburn.edu/economics/people/display.cfm?PersonID=2749 |archivedate= 1 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  the concept that [[Detroit]]’s shipbuilding industry from the 1830s was the critical antecedent leading to the 1890s development of the auto industry in Detroit since the [[gasoline engine]] firms easily transitioned from building gasoline engines for ships to building them for automobiles.&lt;ref name="economy"/&gt;

==Policy implications==
As information is largely [[Rivalry (economics)|non-rival]] in nature, certain measures must{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} be taken to ensure that, for the originator, the information remains a private [[asset]].  As the market cannot do this efficiently, public [[regulations]] have been implemented to facilitate a more appropriate [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]].

As a result, the concept of [[intellectual property rights]] have developed and ensure the ability of entrepreneurs to temporarily hold on to the profitability of their ideas through [[patent]]s, [[copyright]]s, and other governmental safeguards.  Conversely, such barriers to entry prevent the exploitation of informational developments by rival firms within an industry.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

On the other hand, when the research and development of a private firm results in a social benefit, unaccounted for within the market price, often greater than the private return of the firm’s research, then a [[subsidy]] to offset the underproduction of that benefit might be offered to the firm in return for its continued output of that benefit.  Government subsidies are often controversial, and while they might often result in a more appropriate social equilibrium, they could also lead to undesirable political repercussions as such a subsidy must come from taxpayers, some of whom may not directly benefit from the researching firm’s subsidized knowledge spillover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Harvey S.|title=Public Finance 9th Ed.|year=2010|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-07-351135-1|pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of knowledge spillover is also used to justify subsidies to [[foreign direct investment]], as foreign investors help diffuse technology among local firms.&lt;ref name="spillovers"&gt;Tomas Havranek and Zuzana Irsova, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinteco.2011.07.004 "Estimating vertical spillovers from FDI: Why results vary and what the true effect is"], Journal of International Economics, 2011 Vol. 85, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4902">'''Laser ignition''' is an alternative method for igniting mixtures of fuel and oxidiser. The phase of the mixture can be gaseous or liquid. The method is based on [[laser]] ignition devices that produce short but powerful flashes regardless of the pressure in the [[combustion chamber]]. Usually, high voltage [[spark plug]]s are good enough for automotive use, as the typical [[compression ratio]] of an [[otto cycle]] [[internal combustion engine]] is around 10:1 and in [[SkyActiv|some rare cases]] reach 14:1. However, fuels such as [[natural gas]] or [[methanol]] can withstand high compression without [[self ignition]].  This allows higher compression ratios, because it is economically reasonable, as the [[fuel efficiency]] of such engines is high. Using high compression ratio and high pressure requires special spark plugs that are expensive and their [[electrode]]s still wear out. Thus, even expensive laser ignition systems could be economical, because they would last longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photonics.com/Article.aspx?AID=51731 |title=Laser Car Ignition Dream Sparks Multiple Approaches |author=Marshall, Laura |date=September 2012 |website=Photonics Spectra |publisher=Laurin Publishing |accessdate=2014-04-07 |quote=“Laser plugs have no electrodes. Assuming replacement every 500 hours, this is $16,000 per year just in spark plug costs, compared to approximately $10,000 for the laser diode array. The usual advertised lifetime for laser diodes is over 10,000 hours, and, since the duty factor is 10 to 20 percent, they can potentially last for much longer.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="liv.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/researchintelligence/issue36/laserignition.htm |title=New way to get that vital spark - University of Liverpool |publisher=Liv.ac.uk |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2014-02-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110152513/http://www.liv.ac.uk/researchintelligence/issue36/laserignition.htm |archivedate=2014-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13160950&lt;/ref&gt;

India has launched 239 satellites for 28 different countries as of October, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Customer Satellites Launched|url=http://www.antrix.gov.in/business/international-customer-satellites-launched|website=www.antrix.gov.in|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial launches for foreign nations are negotiated through [[Antrix Corporation|Antrix]], the commercial arm of the [[Indian Space Research Organisation|Indian Space Research Organization]] (ISRO). All satellites were launched using the ISRO's [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle]] (PSLV) [[expendable launch system]]. Between 2013 and 2015, India launched 28 foreign satellites for 13 different countries earning a total revenue of US$101 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India says PSLV launches generated $101 million in commercial launch fees 2013-2015 - SpaceNews.com|url=http://spacenews.com/indias-government-says-pslv-launches-generated-101-million-in-commercial-launch-fees-2013-2015/|website=SpaceNews.com|accessdate=25 April 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISRO successfully launched 104 satellites on 15 February 2017, of which 3 satellites are Indian satellites while the remaining are foreign commercial satellites. Ninety-six satellites are from the United States, while the others come from Israel, the UAE, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.&lt;ref name="largest launch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/science/features/isro-launches-pslv-c37-rocket-heres-the-list-of-104-satellites-on-board-1659740|title=ISRO Launches PSLV-C37 Rocket: Here's the List of 104 Satellites on Board|website=NDTV Gadgets360|language=en|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest number of satellites launched on a single flight by any space agency.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7488">The following is a '''list of second moments of area''' of some shapes. The [[second moment of area]], also known as area moment of inertia, is a geometrical property of an area which reflects how its points are distributed with regard to an arbitrary axis. The [[physical unit|unit]] of dimension of the second moment of area is length to fourth power, [[Unit of length|L]]&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and should not be confused with the [[mass moment of inertia]]. If the piece is thin, however, the mass moment of inertia equals the area density times the area moment of inertia.

== Parallel axis theorem ==
[[Image:Parallel axis theorem.svg|thumb]]
{{main|Parallel axis theorem}}

The parallel axis theorem can be used to determine the second moment of area of a rigid body about any axis, given the body's moment of inertia about a parallel axis through the object's center of mass and the perpendicular distance (d) between the axes.

&lt;math&gt;I_{x'} = I_{x} + Ad^2&lt;/math&gt;

Since the year 2000, a number of [[Kuiper belt]] objects (KBOs) with diameters of between 500 and 1500&amp;nbsp;km (more than half that of Pluto) have been discovered. [[50000 Quaoar]], a classical KBO discovered in 2002, is over 1200&amp;nbsp;km across. {{dp|Makemake}} and {{dp|Haumea}}, both announced on 29 July 2005, are larger still. Other objects, such as [[28978 Ixion]] (discovered in 2001) and [[20000 Varuna]] (discovered in 2000) measure roughly 500&amp;nbsp;km across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Solar System Beyond The Planets |author1=Audrey Delsanti |author2=David Jewitt |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii |url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/papers/2006/DJ06.pdf |accessdate=2007-03-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129151907/http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/papers/2006/DJ06.pdf |archivedate=2007-01-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led gradually to the acceptance of [[Pluto]] as the largest member of the Kuiper belt.

The brightest known [[dwarf planet]]s and other KBOs (with [[absolute magnitude]]s &lt; 4.0), are:

'''Martin-de-Viviès''', or '''La Roche Godon''', formerly '''Camp Heurtin''', is a [[research station]] and the only settlement on the [[Île Amsterdam]] and [[Île Saint-Paul]] islands of the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]] in the southern [[Indian Ocean]].  It lies on the north coast of Amsterdam Island and houses about thirty people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=kuschk|title=Île Amsterdam: Isolated in the Indian Ocean|url=http://basementgeographer.com/ile-amsterdam-isolated-in-the-indian-ocean/|website=The Basement Geographer|accessdate=10 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220063334/http://basementgeographer.com/ile-amsterdam-isolated-in-the-indian-ocean/|archivedate=December 20, 2016|date=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was named after [[Paul de Martin de Viviès]] who, with ten others, spent the winter of 1949 on the island.

The station was originally named Camp Heurtin and has been in operation since 1 January 1981, superseding the first station, La Roche Godon.

The [[Global Atmosphere Watch]] is one of the programs that the station participates in.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

'''Michał Horodecki''' is a physicist at the [[University of Gdańsk]] working in the field of [[quantum information]] theory, notable for his work on entanglement theory.   

Together with [[Jonathan Oppenheim]] and [[Andreas Winter]], he discovered quantum [[state-merging]] and used this primitive to show that quantum information could be negative.  He also co-discovered the [[Peres-Horodecki criterion]] for testing whether a state is entangled, and used it to find [[bound entanglement]] together with his brother [[Paweł Horodecki]] and father [[Ryszard Horodecki]]. He co-discovered with Jonathan Oppenheim, [[Paweł Horodecki]] and Karol Horodecki that secret key can be drawn from some bound entangled states. Together with [[Fernando  Brandao]] he proved that every one-dimensional quantum state with a finite correlation length obeys an area law for entanglement entropy.

Fungi have been proven to be a very cheap, effective and environmentally sound way for helping to remove a wide array of toxins from damaged environments or [[wastewater]]. The toxins include [[heavy metals]], persistent organic pollutants, textile [[dyes]], [[leather tanning]] industry chemicals and wastewater, petroleum fuels, [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]], pharmaceuticals and personal care products, pesticides and herbicide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deshmukh|first1=Radhika|last2=Khardenavis|first2=Anshuman A.|last3=Purohit|first3=Hemant J.|date=2016|title=Diverse Metabolic Capacities of Fungi for Bioremediation|journal=Indian Journal of Microbiology|volume=56|issue=3|pages=247–264|doi=10.1007/s12088-016-0584-6|issn=0046-8991|pmc=4920763|pmid=27407289}}&lt;/ref&gt; in land, fresh water and marine environments. 
The byproducts of the remediation can be valuable materials themselves, such as enzymes (like [[laccase]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strong|first1=P. J.|last2=Burgess|first2=J.

Fungi, thanks to their non-specific enzymes, are able to break down many kinds of substances. They are used for pharmaceuticals and fragrances that normally are recalcitant to bacteria degradation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harms|first1=Hauke|last2=Schlosser|first2=Dietmar|last3=Wick|first3=Lukas Y.|title=Untapped potential: exploiting fungi in bioremediation of hazardous chemicals|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|date=2011|volume=9|issue=3|page=188|doi=10.1038/nrmicro2519|url=http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v9/n3/full/nrmicro2519.html?foxtrotcallback=true|accessdate=26 September 2017|language=en|issn=1740-1526|quote=municipal wastewater contains small concentrations of the ingredients of many consumer products and drugs.

Mycoremediation is one of the cheaper solutions to remediation, and it doesn't usually require expensive equipment. For this reasons it is often used also in small scale applications, such as [[mycofiltration]] of domestic [[wastewater]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molla|first1=Abul Hossain|last2=Fakhru'l-Razi|first2=Ahmadun|title=Mycoremediation--a prospective environmental friendly technique of bioseparation and dewatering of domestic wastewater sludge|journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research International|date=2012|volume=19|issue=5|pages=1612–1619|doi=10.1007/s11356-011-0676-0|language=en|issn=1614-7499|quote=Within 2-3 days of treatment application, encouraging results were achieved in total dry solids (TDS), total suspended solid (TSS), turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), specific resistance to filtration (SRF), and pH due to fungal treatment in recognition of bioseparation and dewaterability of wastewater sludge compared to control.|pmid=22134862}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to help with the decomposition process of a [[compost toilet]].

=== Metals ===
Pollution from metals is very common, as they are used in many industrial processes such as [[electroplating]], [[paint]] and [[leather]]. The wastewater from these industries is often used for agricultural purposes, so besides the immediate damage to the ecosystem it is spilled into, the metals can enter far away creatures and humans through the food chain. Mycoremediation is one of the cheapest, most effective and environmental-friendly solutions to this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshi|first1=P. K.|last2=Swarup|first2=Anand|last3=Maheshwari|first3=Sonu|last4=Kumar|first4=Raman|last5=Singh|first5=Namita|title=Bioremediation of Heavy Metals in Liquid Media Through Fungi Isolated from Contaminated Sources|journal=Indian Journal of Microbiology|date=October 2011|volume=51|issue=4|pages=482–487|doi=10.1007/s12088-011-0110-9|language=en|issn=0046-8991|quote=Wastewater particularly from electroplating, paint, leather, metal and tanning industries contain enormous amount of heavy metals. Microorganisms including fungi have been reported to exclude heavy metals from wastewater through bioaccumulation and biosorption at low cost and in eco-friendly way.|pmc=3209935|pmid=23024411}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many fungi are [[hyperaccumulators]], that means they are able to concentrate toxins in their fruiting bodies for later removal.

The capacity of certain fungi to extract metals from the ground also can be useful for [[bioindicator]] purposes, and can be a problem when the mushroom is an edible one. For example, the shaggy ink cap (''[[Coprinus comatus]]''), a common edible north-hemisphere mushroom, can be a very good bioindicator of mercury, and accumulate it in its body, which can also be toxic to the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Falandysz|first1=Jerzy|title=Mercury bio-extraction by fungus Coprinus comatus: a possible bioindicator and mycoremediator of polluted soils?|journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research International|date=2016|volume=23|issue=8|pages=7444–7451|doi=10.1007/s11356-015-5971-8|language=en|issn=1614-7499|quote=Eating them when foraged from the urban places can provide to a consumer Hg at relatively high dose, while unresolved question is absorption rate of Hg compounds contained in ingested mushroom meal.|pmid=26705753|pmc=4846694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dyes ===

[[Dye]]s are used in many industries, like paper printing or textile. They are often recalcitant to degradation and in some cases, like some [[azo dyes]], [[cancerogenic]] or otherwise toxic.

The mechanism the fungi degrade this dyes is their lignolytic enzymes, especially laccase, so white rot mushrooms are the most commonly used.

Mycoremediation has proven to be a cheap and effective remediation technology for dyes such as [[malachite green]], [[nigrosin]] and [[basic fuchsin]] with ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' and ''[[Phanerochaete chrysosporium]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rani|first1=Babita|last2=Kumar|first2=Vivek|last3=Singh|first3=Jagvijay|last4=Bisht|first4=Sandeep|last5=Teotia|first5=Priyanku|last6=Sharma|first6=Shivesh|last7=Kela|first7=Ritu|title=Bioremediation of dyes by fungi isolated from contaminated dye effluent sites for bio-usability|journal=Brazilian Journal of Microbiology|date=9 October 2014|volume=45|issue=3|pages=1055–1063|language=en|issn=1517-8382|quote=Aspergillus niger recorded maximum decolorization of the dye Basic fuchsin (81.85%) followed by Nigrosin (77.47%), Malachite green (72.77%) and dye mixture (33.08%) under shaking condition.

== Synergy with phytoremediation ==

[[Phytoremediation]] is the use of plant-based technologies to decontamination an area. Most of the plants can form a symbiosis with fungi, from which both the organisms get an advantage. This relationship is called [[mycorrhiza]].

Mycorrhizal fungi, especially [[arbuscular mycorrhiza|arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi]] (AMF), can greatly improve the phytoremediation capacity of some plants. This is mostly because the stress the plants suffer because of the pollutants is greatly reduced in presence of AMF, so they can grow more and produce more biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rabie|first1=Gamal H.|title=Role of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi in Phytoremediation of Soil Rhizosphere Spiked with Poly Aromatic Hydrocarbons|journal=Mycobiology|date=2005|volume=33|issue=1|pages=41–50|doi=10.4489/MYCO.2005.33.1.041|language=en|issn=1229-8093|quote=As consequence of the treatment with Am [Arbuscolar mycorrhize], the plants provide a greater sink for the contaminants since they are better able to survive and grow.|pmc=3774856|pmid=24049473}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fungi also provide more nutrition, especially [[phosphorus]], and promotes the overall health of the plant. The mycelium quick expansion also can greatly extend the rhizosphere influenze zone ([[hyphosphere]]), providing the plant with access to more nutrients and contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rajtor|first1=Monika|last2=Piotrowska-Seget|first2=Zofia|title=Prospects for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to assist in phytoremediation of soil hydrocarbon contaminants|journal=Chemosphere|date=2016|volume=162|pages=105–116|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.07.071|issn=1879-1298|quote=AMF have been considered to be a tool to enhance phytoremediation, as their mycelium create a widespread underground network that acts as a bridge between plant roots, soil and rhizosphere microorganisms. Abundant extramatrical hyphae extend the rhizosphere thus creating the hyphosphere, which significantly increases the area of a plant's access to nutrients and contaminants.|pmid=27487095}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the rhizosphere overall health also means a rise in the bacteria population, which can also contribute to the bioremediation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rabie|first1=Gamal H.|title=Role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in phytoremediation of soil rhizosphere spiked with poly aromatic hydrocarbons|journal=Mycobiology|date=2005|volume=33|issue=1|pages=41–50|doi=10.4489/MYCO.2005.33.1.041|issn=1229-8093|quote=Highly significant positive correlations were shown between of arbuscular formation in root segments (A)) and plant water content, root lipids, peroxidase, catalase polyphenol oxidase and total microbial count in soil rhizosphere as well as PAH dissipation in spiked soil.|pmid=24049473|pmc=3774856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social life''' is the least defined and least understood of the different ways of approaching [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]]. Social sustainability has had considerably less attention in public dialogue than economic and environmental sustainability.

There are several approaches to sustainability. The first, which posits a triad of environmental sustainability, [[economic sustainability]], and social sustainability, is the most widely accepted as a model for addressing sustainability.  The concept of "social sustainability" in this approach encompasses such topics as: [[social equity]], [[livability]], [[health equity]], [[community development]], [[social capital]], [[social support]], [[human rights]], [[labour rights]], [[placemaking]], [[social responsibility]], [[social justice]], [[cultural competence]], community resilience, and human adaptation.

A second, more recent, approach suggests that all of the domains of sustainability are social: including ecological, economic, political and cultural sustainability. These domains of social sustainability are all dependent upon the relationship between the social and the natural, with the "ecological domain" defined as human embeddedness in the environment. In these terms, social sustainability encompasses all human activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not just relevant to the focussed intersection of economics, the environment and the social.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2013 |author1=Liam Magee |author2=Andy Scerri |author3=Paul James |author4=James A.

==Definitions==

According to the Western Australia Council of Social Services (WACOSS):&lt;ref&gt;[http://auspsa.anu.edu.au/proceedings/publications/Partridgepaper.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ''"Social sustainability occurs when the formal and informal processes; systems; structures; and relationships actively support the capacity of current and future generations to create healthy and liveable communities. Socially sustainable communities are equitable, diverse, connected and democratic and provide a good quality of life."''

Another definition has been developed by Social Life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.social-life.co/ http://www.social-life.co]&lt;/ref&gt; a UK-based social enterprise specialising in place-based innovation. They define social sustainability as "''a process for creating sustainable, successful places that promote wellbeing, by understanding what people need from the places they live and work. Social sustainability combines design of the physical realm with design of the social world – infrastructure to support social and cultural life, social amenities, systems for citizen engagement and space for people and places to evolve''."&lt;ref name="social-life.co"&gt;[http://www.social-life.co/media/files/DESIGN_FOR_SOCIAL_SUSTAINABILITY_3.pdf S.Woodcraft et al (2011) Design for Social Sustainability, Social Life, London]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimensions==

Social Life have developed a framework for social sustainability&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.social-life.co/publication/Social-Sustainability/]&lt;/ref&gt;  which has four dimensions: amenities and infrastructure, social and cultural life, voice and influence, and space to grow.&lt;ref name="social-life.co"/&gt;

Nobel Laureate [[Amartya Sen]] gives the following dimensions for social sustainability:&lt;ref&gt;[http://integral-sustainability.net/wp-content/uploads/sas4-2-hodgson.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Equity''' - the community provides equitable opportunities and outcomes for all its members, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable members of the community
*'''Diversity''' - the community promotes and encourages diversity
*'''Interconnected/Social cohesions''' - the community provides processes, systems and structures that promote connectedness within and outside the community at the formal, informal and institutional level
*'''Quality of life''' - the community ensures that basic needs are met and fosters a good quality of life for all members at the individual, group and community level (e.g. health, housing, education, employment, safety)
*'''Democracy and governance''' - the community provides democratic processes and open and accountable governance structures.
*'''Maturity''' - the individual accept the responsibility of consistent growth and improvement through broader social attributes (e.g. communication styles, behavioural patterns, indirect education and philosophical explorations)

Also we can speak of Sustainable Human Development that can be seen as development that promotes the capabilities of present people without compromising capabilities of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, A.K. (2000) ‘The ends and means of sustainability’, keynote address at the International Conference on Transition to sustainability, Tokyo, May&lt;/ref&gt; In the human development paradigm, environment and natural resources should constitute a means of achieving better standards of living just as income represents a means of increasing social expenditure and, in the end, well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Anand, S. and Sen, A.K. (1996) ‘Sustainable human development: concepts and priorities’, Office of Development Studies Discussion Paper, No. 1, UNDP, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The different aspects of social sustainability are often considered in [[socially responsible investing]] (SRI). Social sustainability criteria that are commonly used by SRI funds and indexes to rate publicly traded companies include: community, diversity, employee relations, human rights, product safety, reporting, and governance structure.&lt;ref&gt;KLD Research.

== Application and Verification ==
The [[United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights|UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights]] state that countries have the obligation to “respect, protect, and fulfill human rights and fundamental freedoms” and that business enterprises are required to comply with all applicable laws and respect human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf|title=Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights|last=United Nations Human Rights, Office of the Commissioner|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations, New York and Geneva|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both production and procurement of goods and services should be documented to verify satisfaction of these international principles and laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/541/verifying-delivery-sustainable-products-services|title=Verifying Delivery of Sustainable Products and Services - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN Guiding Principles also include a reporting framework,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ungpreporting.org/|title=UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework|website=www.ungpreporting.org|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which teaches companies how to report their interaction with human rights issues. In addition resources like Free2Work,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.free2work.org/ Free2Work]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Global Reporting Initiative]], and [http://business-humanrights.org/ Business and Human Rights Resource Centre] all provide information on organizational disclosures and performance in social sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/545/social-sustainability|title=Social Sustainability - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certifications from internationally recognized and accredited organizations are available to aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services.

'''Tech Gate Vienna''' is a science and technology park in the City of [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], situated in the 22nd district [[Donaustadt]]. It was built between 1999 and 2005 following the plans from architects [[Wilhelm Holzbauer]] and [[Sepp Frank]] in an area called [[Donau City]].

Tech Gate Vienna consists of two buildings. The first, 26 meter high building was completed in 2001 and has 7 floors, with a total of 36,000 square meters of room. The second building was built from 2004 to 2005 and is 75 meters high with 18,000 square meters of room on 19 floors.

Aside many companies and start-ups, several technology labs are situated in Tech Gate Vienna buildings, such as the [[Austrian Institute of Technology]], the Telecommunications Research Center Vienna (FTW), and the [[VRVis]] Research Center. Four attractive stages are utilized for a variety of technology affine events.

'''''The Dorito Effect: The Surprising New Truth about Food and Flavor''''', by Mark Schatzker, is a book about two detrimental trends in modern [[food culture]].  The pursuit of maximum monetary gain by means of increased yield and [[pest resistance]] has involved the neglect of flavor in the [[Selective breeding|breeding]] process.  On the other hand, to provide the flavor missing from [[industrialized food]], [[food processing|food processors]] add [[flavor]]s which fool the body into believing that it is receiving the necessary [[nutrient]]s.  The book was published in 2015 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2355">The '''thermal Hall effect''' is the thermal analog of the [[Hall effect]]. Here, a thermal gradient is produced across a solid instead of an electric field. When a magnetic field is applied, an orthogonal temperature gradient develops.

For [[conductor (material)|conductors]], a significant portion of the thermal current is carried by the electrons. In particular, the '''Righi–Leduc effect'''&lt;ref&gt;After the Italian physicist [[Augusto Righi]] (1850–1920) and the French physicist [[Sylvestre Anatole Leduc]] (1856–1937), see: {{cite book

Measurements of the thermal Hall conductivity are used to distinguish between the electronic and lattice contributions to thermal conductivity. These measurements are especially useful when studying [[superconductors]].

The '''triune brain''' is a model of the [[evolution]] of the [[vertebrate]] [[forebrain]] and behavior, proposed by the American physician and [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]] [[Paul D. MacLean]]. MacLean originally formulated his model in the 1960s and propounded it at length in his 1990 book ''The Triune Brain in Evolution''.&lt;ref name="KHEPER"&gt;{{cite web| last = Kazlev| first = M. Alan| title = The Triune Brain.| work = KHEPER| date = 2003-10-19| url = http://www.kheper.net/topics/intelligence/MacLean.htm| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20031119214318/http://www.kheper.net/topics/intelligence/MacLean.htm| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2003-11-19| accessdate = 2007-05-25| display-authors = etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The triune brain consists of the [[Basal ganglia|reptilian complex]], the paleomammalian complex ([[limbic system]]), and the neomammalian complex ([[neocortex]]), viewed as structures sequentially added to the forebrain in the course of evolution. However, this hypothesis is no longer espoused by the majority of comparative neuroscientists in the post-2000 era.&lt;ref&gt;Kiverstein, J., &amp; Miller, M. (2015). The embodied brain: towards a radical embodied cognitive neuroscience. Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 9, 237. http://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00237&lt;/ref&gt; 
The triune brain hypothesis became familiar to a broad popular audience through [[Carl Sagan]]'s [[Pulitzer prize]] winning 1977 book ''[[The Dragons of Eden]]''. The theory has been embraced by some psychiatrists and at least one leading [[affective neuroscience]] researcher.&lt;ref&gt;Panksepp, J. (2003). Foreword to Cory, G. and Gardner, R. (2002) ''The Evolutionary Neuroethology of Paul MacLean: Convergences and Frontiers''. {{ISBN|978-0275972196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reptilian complex ==
The reptilian complex, also known as the R-complex or "reptilian brain" was the name MacLean gave to the [[basal ganglia]], structures derived from the floor of the forebrain during development. The term derives from the idea that comparative neuroanatomists once believed that the forebrains of reptiles and birds were dominated by these structures. MacLean proposed that the reptilian complex was responsible for species-typical instinctual behaviours involved in aggression, dominance, territoriality, and ritual displays. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Paleomammalian complex ==
The paleomammalian brain consists of the [[septum]], [[amygdalae]], [[hypothalamus]], [[hippocampus|hippocampal complex]], and [[cingulate cortex]]. MacLean first introduced the term "[[limbic system]]" to refer to this set of interconnected brain structures in a paper in 1952. MacLean's recognition of the limbic system as a major functional system in the brain was widely accepted among neuroscientists, and is generally regarded as his most important contribution to the field. MacLean maintained that the structures of the limbic system arose early in mammalian evolution (hence "paleomammalian") and were responsible for the motivation and emotion involved in feeding, reproductive behaviour, and parental behaviour.  {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Neomammalian complex ==
The neomammalian complex consists of the cerebral [[neocortex]], a structure found uniquely in higher mammals, and especially humans. MacLean regarded its addition as the most recent step in the evolution of the mammalian brain, conferring the ability for language, abstraction, planning, and perception. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Status of the model ==
MacLean originally formulated the triune brain hypothesis in the 1960s, drawing on comparative neuroanatomical work done by [[Ludwig Edinger]], [[Elizabeth C. Crosby]] and Charles Judson Herrick early in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reiner|first=A. |year=1990 |title=An Explanation of Behavior |journal=Science |volume=250 |pages=303–305 |doi=10.1126/science.250.4978.303-a|pmid=17797318|issue=4978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = PrinciplesBrainEvolution&gt;[[Georg F. Striedter|Striedter, G. F.]] (2005) ''Principles of Brain Evolution.'' Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s saw a rebirth of interest in comparative neuroanatomy, motivated in part by the availability of a variety of new neuroanatomical techniques for charting the circuitry of animal brains. Subsequent findings have refined the traditional neuroanatomical ideas upon which MacLean based his hypothesis.

For example, the basal ganglia (structures derived from the floor of the forebrain and making up MacLean's reptilian complex) were shown to take up a much smaller portion of the forebrains of reptiles and birds (together called [[sauropsids]]) than previously supposed, and to exist in [[amphibians]] and [[fish]] as well as [[mammals]] and sauropsids. Because the basal ganglia are found in the forebrains of all modern vertebrates, they most likely date to the common evolutionary ancestor of the vertebrates, more than 500 million years ago, rather than to the origin of reptiles.

Some recent behavioral studies do not support the traditional view of sauropsid behavior as stereotyped and ritualistic (as in MacLean's reptilian complex). Birds have been shown to possess highly sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as the toolmaking of the [[New Caledonian crow]] and the language-like categorization abilities of the [[grey parrot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Paul | last=Patton |title= One World, Many Minds: Intelligence in the Animal Kingdom |url= http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=one-world-many-minds |work= Scientific American |date= December 2008|accessdate=29 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structures of the limbic system, which MacLean proposed arose in early mammals, have now been shown to exist across a range of modern vertebrates. The "paleomammalian" trait of parental care of offspring is widespread in birds and occurs in some fishes as well.  Thus, like the basal ganglia, the evolution of these systems presumably dates to a common vertebrate ancestor.&lt;ref name = PrinciplesBrainEvolution /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Butler, A. B. and Hodos, W. Comparative Vertebrate Neuroanatomy: Evolution and Adaptation, Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, recent studies based on paleontological data or comparative anatomical evidence strongly suggest that the neocortex was already present in the earliest emerging mammals.&lt;ref name="PrinciplesBrainEvolution"/&gt; In addition, although non-mammals do not have a neocortex in the true sense (that is, a structure comprising part of the forebrain roof, or pallium,  consisting of six characteristic layers of neurons), they possess [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallial]] regions, and some parts of the pallium are considered homologous to the mammalian neocortex. While these areas lack the characteristic six neocortical layers, birds and reptiles generally possess three layers in the dorsal pallium (the homolog of the mammalian neocortex).&lt;ref name = PrinciplesBrainEvolution /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The [[telencephalon]] of birds and mammals makes neuroanatomical connections with other telecencephalic structures&lt;ref name = PrinciplesBrainEvolution /&gt; like those made by neocortex. It mediates similar functions such as perception, learning and memory, decision making, motor control, conceptual thinking.

== Lay interest ==
The triune model of the mammalian brain is seen as an oversimplified organizing theme by some in the field of comparative neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = CU | year = 2010 | title = The triune brain in antiquity: Plato, Aristotle, Erasistratus | url = | journal = [[Journal of the History of the Neurosciences]] | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 1–14 | doi = 10.1080/09647040802601605 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to hold public interest because of its simplicity. While technically inaccurate in many respects as an explanation for brain activity, it remains one of very few approximations of the truth we have to work with:  the "neocortex" represents that cluster of brain structures involved in advanced cognition, including planning, modeling and simulation; the "limbic brain" refers to those brain structures, wherever located, associated with social and nurturing behaviors, mutual reciprocity, and other behaviors and affects that arose during the age of the mammals; and the "reptilian brain" refers to those brain structures related to territoriality, ritual behavior and other "reptile" behaviors.  The broad explanatory value makes this approximation very engaging and is a useful level of complexity for high school students to begin engaging with brain research.
 
[[Howard Bloom]], in his book ''[[The Lucifer Principle]]'', references the concept of the triune brain in his explanations of certain aspects of human behavior. [[Arthur Koestler]] made MacLean's concept of the triune brain the centerpiece of much of his later work, notably ''[[The Ghost in the Machine]]''. English novelist [[Julian Barnes]] quotes MacLean on the triune brain in the foreword to his 1982 novel ''Before She Met Me''. Peter A. Levine uses the triune brain concept in his book ''Waking the Tiger'' to explain his [[somatic experiencing]] approach to healing trauma.

Glynda-Lee Hoffmann, in her book, "The Secret Dowry of Eve, Women's Role in the Development of Consciousness," references the triune theory explored by MacLean, and she goes one step further.  Her theory about human behavior and the problems we create with that behavior, distinguishes the prefrontal cortex as uniquely different from the rest of the neocortex.  The prefrontal cortex, with its agenda of integration, is the part of the brain that can get the other parts to work together for the good of the individual.  In many humans the reptilian cortex (agenda: territory and reproduction [in humans that translates to power and sex] is out of control and the amygdala stokes the fear that leads to more bad behavior.  The prefrontal cortex is the key to our future if we can harness its power.&lt;ref&gt;The Secret Dowry of Eve 2003, {{ISBN|0-89281-968-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Letharia vulpina closeup.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Letharia vulpina]]'', one of the species of lichen credited with having a cancer-inhibiting molecule in a fake manuscript.&lt;ref name="bohannon"/&gt;]]
"'''Who's Afraid of Peer Review?'''" is an article written by [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] correspondent [[John Bohannon]] that describes his investigation of [[peer review]] among [[Open access journal#Fee-based open access journals|fee-charging open-access journals]]. Between January and August 2013, Bohannon submitted fake scientific papers to 304 journals owned by as many fee-charging open access publishers. The papers, writes Bohannon, "were designed with such grave and obvious scientific flaws that they should have been rejected immediately by editors and peer reviewers", but 60% of the journals accepted them. The article and associated data were published in the 4 October 2013 issue of ''Science'' as open access.&lt;ref name="bohannon60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Who's Afraid of Peer Review: Data and Documents"/&gt;

==Background==
The first fee-charging open access scientific journals began appearing in 2000 with the creation of [[BioMed Central]] and then the [[Plos|Public Library of Science]]. Rather than deriving at least some of their revenue from subscription fees, fee-charging open access journals only charge the authors (or their funders) a [[Article Processing Charge|publication fee]]. The published papers are then freely available on the internet. This business model, [[gold open access]], is one of several solutions devised to make open access publishing sustainable.&lt;ref name="Open Access Overview"/&gt; The number of articles published open access, or made freely available after some time behind a paywall ([[delayed open access journal|delayed open access]]), has grown rapidly. In 2013 more than half of the scientific papers published in 2011 were available for free.&lt;ref name="Half of 2011 papers now free to read"/&gt;

In part because of the low barrier to entry into this market, as well as the fast and potentially large return on investment, many so-called "[[Predatory open access publishing|predatory publishers]]" have created low-quality journals that provide little to no peer review or editorial control, essentially publishing every submitted article as long as the publication fee is paid. Some of these publishers additionally deceive authors about publication fees, use the names of scientists as editors and reviewers without their knowledge, and/or obfuscate the true location and identity of the publishers.&lt;ref name="Some Online Journals Will Publish Fake Science, For A Fee"/&gt; The prevalence of these deceptive publishers, and what the [[scientific community]] should do about them, has been hotly debated.&lt;ref name="Investigating journals: The dark side of publishing"/&gt;

==Methods==

===Fake papers===
Bohannon used [[Python (programming language)|Python]] to create a "scientific version of [[Mad Libs]]".&lt;ref name="bohannon60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Inside Science Magazine's 'Sting' of Open Access Journals"/&gt; The paper's template is "Molecule X from [[lichen]] species Y inhibits the growth of cancer cell Z". He created a database of molecules, lichens, and cancer cells to substitute for X, Y, and Z. The data and conclusions were identical in every paper. The authors and their affiliations were also unique, and fake. The papers all described the discovery of a new cancer drug extracted from a lichen, but the data did not support that conclusion and the papers had intentionally obvious flaws.&lt;ref name="Science's Sokal moment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fake Cancer Study Spotlights Bogus Science Journals"/&gt;

===Publisher targets===
To build a comprehensive list of fee-charging open access publishers, Bohannon relied on two sources: [[Beall's List]] of predatory publishers and the [[Directory of Open Access Journals]] (DOAJ). After filtering both lists for open access journals published in English, that charge authors a publication fee, and that have at least one medical, biological, or chemical journal, the list of targets included 304 publishers: 167 from the DOAJ, 121 from Beall's list, and 16 that were listed by both. The investigation focused entirely on fee-charging open access journals. Bohannon did not include other types of open access journals or subscription journals for comparison because the turnaround time for reviews in traditional journals is too long. The study consequently makes no claim about the relative quality of the different types of journals.&lt;ref name="Science reporter spoofs hundreds of open access journals with fake papers"/&gt;

==Results==

===Acceptance versus rejection===
In total, 157 of the journals accepted the paper and 98 rejected it, with the other 49 not having completed their evaluation by the time Bohannon wrote his article.&lt;ref name="bohannon60"/&gt; Of the 255 papers that underwent the entire peer review process to acceptance or rejection, about 60% of the final decisions occurred with no sign of actual peer review. For rejections, that may possibly have reflected filtering at the editorial level, but for acceptance can only reflect a flawed process. Only 36 submissions generated review comments recognizing any of the paper's scientific problems. 16 of those 36 papers were nonetheless accepted, in spite of poor to damning reviews. Many of the journals that accepted the paper are published by prestigious institutions and publishing companies, including [[Elsevier#Who's Afraid of Peer Review|Elsevier]], [[Sage Publications|Sage]], [[Wolters Kluwer]] (through its subsidiary [[Medknow Publications|Medknow]]), and several universities.&lt;ref name="bohannon60"/&gt;

Among those that rejected the paper are journals published by [[Public Library of Science|PLOS]], [[BioMed Central]], and [[Hindawi Publishing Corporation|Hindawi]]. The peer review provided by ''[[PLOS ONE]]'' was reported to be the most rigorous of all, and it was the only journal that identified the paper's [[Research ethics|ethical problems]], for example the lack of documentation of how [[animal testing|animals were treated]] in the creation of the cancer cell lines.&lt;ref name="bohannon60"/&gt;

===DOAJ versus Beall's list===
Among the publishers on Beall's list that completed the review process, 82% accepted the paper. Bohannon stated "the results show that Beall is good at spotting publishers with poor quality control". According to [[Jeffrey Beall]], who created the list, this supports his claim to be identifying "predatory" publishers.&lt;ref name="Science Magazine Conducts Sting Operation on OA Publishers"/&gt; However, the remaining 18% of publishers identified by Beall as predatory rejected the fake paper, leading [[Science communication|science communicator]] Phil Davis to state "That means that Beall is falsely accusing nearly one in five".&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite web |last1=Davis |first1=Phil |url=http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/10/04/open-access-sting-reveals-deception-missed-opportunities/|title=Open Access "Sting" Reveals Deception, Missed Opportunities |work=[[The Scholarly Kitchen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the DOAJ publishers that completed the review process, 45% accepted the paper.&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt; According to a statement published on the DOAJ website, new criteria for inclusion in the DOAJ are being implemented.&lt;ref name="doaj"/&gt;

===Global map of journal fraud===
Along with the report, ''Science'' published a map that shows the location of publishers, editors, and their bank accounts, color-coded by acceptance or rejection of the paper. The locations were derived from IP address traces within the raw headers of e-mails, [[WHOIS]] registrations, and bank invoices for publication fees. India emerged as the world's largest base for fee-charging open-access publishing, with 64 accepting the fatally flawed papers and only 15 rejecting it.&lt;ref name="bohannon60" /&gt; The United States is the next largest base, with 29 publishers accepting the paper and 26 rejecting it. In Africa, Nigeria has the largest number, of which 100% accepted the paper.&lt;ref name="Peer review map"/&gt;

==Responses==

===Responses from the open-access academic publishing industry===
Since the story was released, publishers of three journals have stated that they are shutting them down.&lt;ref name="Fallout from Science's publisher sting: Journal closes in Croatia"/&gt; The DOAJ is reviewing its list and instituting tighter criteria for inclusion.&lt;ref name="Second response to the Bohannon article"/&gt; The [[Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association]] (OASPA) formed a committee to investigate the circumstances that led to the acceptance of the fake paper by three of its members.&lt;ref name="redhead"/&gt; On 11 November 2013, OASPA terminated the membership of two publishers ([[Dove Medical Press]] and Hikari Ltd.) who accepted the fake paper. Sage Publications, which also accepted a fake paper, was put "under review" for 6 months.&lt;ref name="oaspa"/&gt; Sage announced in a statement that it was reviewing the journal that accepted the fake paper, but that it would not shut it down.&lt;ref name="Statement by SAGE on the Journal of International Medical Research"/&gt;  Sage's membership was reinstated at the end of the review period following changes to the journal's editorial processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shaffi |first=Sarah |url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/oaspa-reinstates-sage-membership.html|title=OASPA reinstates Sage membership |work=[[The Bookseller]] |date=29 April 2014|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses from the scientific community===
Within hours of its publication, the ''Science'' investigation came under intense criticism by some supporters of the open-access movement.&lt;ref name="Critics Say Sting on Open-Access Journals Misses Larger Point"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Post Open Access Sting: An Interview With John Bohannon"/&gt;

The first substantial critique was posted by PLOS cofounder Michael Eisen on his blog. "To suggest – as ''Science'' (though not Bohannon) are trying to do – that the problem with scientific publishing is that open access enables internet scamming is like saying that the problem with the international finance system is that it enables Nigerian wire transfer scams. There are deep problems with science publishing. But the way to fix this is not to curtail open-access publishing. It is to fix peer review."&lt;ref name="I confess, I wrote the Arsenic DNA paper to expose flaws in peer-review at subscription based journals"/&gt; Eisen pointed out the irony of a subscription-based journal like ''Science'' publishing this report when its own peer review has failed so badly before, as in the 2010 publication of the [[GFAJ-1|arsenic DNA paper]].

In an exchange between Eisen and Bohannon in a discussion hosted by [[Peter Suber]], director of the Harvard Open Access Project, Eisen criticized the investigation for the bad publicity it generated for the open-access movement.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; "Your study exclusively targeted open access journals – [which] strongly suggested, whether you meant to suggest this or not, that open access journals are more likely to engage in shoddy peer review and therefore more deserving of scrutiny." Bohannon responded that this critique was equivalent to "[[shooting the messenger]]".

There have also been many statements of support for the investigation,&lt;ref name="Research paper publishing sting reveals lax standards of many open-access journals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt; and statements of concern about the publishing fraud that it revealed.&lt;ref name="Sting exposes 'wild west' of open-access publishing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dubious journal fear stalks India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lessons from the faux journal investigation"/&gt;
The [[Committee on Publication Ethics]] has responded that "There is no doubt that this 'sting' raises a number of issues ... though I'd argue they are not necessarily the ones that ''Science'' thinks are top priorities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicationethics.org/news/cope-response-science-paper-submission-fake-paper-virginia-barbour-behalf-cope-council|title=COPE response to Science paper submission of fake paper, by Virginia Barbour, on behalf of COPE council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
Some scientists have discussed a number of options for making [[Open peer review|peer review more transparent]].&lt;ref name="Transparency in peer review"/&gt; Doing so would make it harder to maintain a predatory journal that does no peer review, because the record of peer review would be lacking or would need to be faked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/information-culture/2014/11/26/is-this-peer-reviewed-predatory-journals-and-the-transparency-of-peer-review/|title=Is this peer reviewed? Predatory journals and the transparency of peer review.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another option is to more rigorously vet journals, for example by further empowering DOAJ or OASPA. DOAJ has recently tightened up its inclusion criteria, with the purpose of serving as a [[whitelist]], very much like [[Predatory journal|Beall's]] has been a [[blacklist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/512017a| title = Open-access website gets tough| journal = Nature| volume = 512| issue = 7512| pages = 17| year = 2014| last1 = Van Noorden | first1 = R.| pmid=25100463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Gurley''' (March 16, 1821 – January 11, 1887) co-founded what is now known as [[Gurley Precision Instruments]] with his brother, and served as vice president and, from 1886 to 1887, acting president of [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]].

Gurley was born in [[Troy, New York]], March 16, 1821, the son of Ephraim and Clarissa (Sharp) Gurley. He received the best education afforded by the schools in this vicinity, and choosing the profession of a civil engineer, attended the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], from which he graduated in 1839. He worked as a surveyor for a few years and then joined the firm of Oscar Hanks, who was a well-known maker of surveying instruments and church bells in Troy. He worked for Hanks for five years.

In 1845, Gurley established his own scientific instrument manufacturing business in partnership with James Phelps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc21620.htm|title = Gurley Family Papers, 1862-1915 (finding aid)|date = |access-date = 22 Feb 2016|website = New York State Library Website|publisher = [[New York State Library]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phelps had had his own shop since 1838. They called the business Phelps &amp; Gurley. In 1844, William Gurley's brother Lewis Ephraim Gurley joined Phelps' shop as an apprentice and he then attended [[Union College]] from 1847 to 1851. Lewis Gurley rejoined the firm in 1851, at which point it was renamed Phelps and Gurleys. In 1852, Phelps sold out his interest and the business was renamed W.&amp; L.E. Gurley. The firm still exists today as [[Gurley Precision Instruments]]. William Gurley was involved in several local organizations. For many years he was connected with the [[YMCA]], and in 1851 was elected its president. He served as [[alderman]] from 1860 to 1864, and as fire commissioner he helped to improve fire prevention systems in major cities. He was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] (Rensselaer Co., 1st D.) in [[90th New York State Legislature|1867]]. In 1868, he was appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury to serve on a commission with Prof. [[Joseph Henry]] and other scientific experts to examine the best meter devised for determining the products of distillation, to be subsequently adopted by the department.

Gurley was a long-time trustee of [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|Rensselaer]], having been elected to that position in 1855. He was secretary of the institution from 1861 to 1872, vice-president from 1872 to 1887 and acting president from 1886 to 1887. He died on January 11, 1887 in Troy.

The [[W. &amp; L. E. Gurley Building]] in Troy was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1983.

The '''World Psychiatric Association''' is an international umbrella organisation of psychiatric societies.

== Objectives and goals ==
Originally created to produce world psychiatric congresses, it has evolved to hold regional meetings, to promote professional education and to set ethical, scientific and treatment standards for [[psychiatry]].

== History ==
[[Jean Delay]] was the first president of the Association for the Organization of World Congresses of Psychiatry when it was started in 1950.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the World Psychiatric Association |website=World Psychiatric Association |url=http://www.wpanet.org/detail.php?section_id=5&amp;content_id=44 |access-date=26 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Ewen Cameron]] became president of the World Psychiatric Association at its formal founding in 1961.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=chronology/&gt; 

In February 1983, the Soviet All-Union Society of Neurologists and Psychiatrists resigned from the World Psychiatric Association. This resignation occurred as a preemptive action amid a movement to expel the Soviet body from the global organization due to [[political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Vera Rich, [https://www.nature.com/articles/301559a0.pdf Soviet psychiatry: pre-emptive resignation?], ''Nature'' (February 17, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan Wynn, [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(83)91514-3/abstract The Soviet Union and the World Psychiatric Association], ''The Lancet'' (February 19, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet body was conditionally readmitted into the World Psychiatric Association in 1989, following some improvements in human rights conditions,&lt;ref&gt;Masha Hamilton, [http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-02/news/mn-1416_1_amnesty-international Soviets Win Praise From Amnesty International], ''Los Angeles Times'' (April 2, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; and an intensive debate among the association's delegates, in which the acting secretary of the Soviet delegation issued a statement conceding that "previous political conditions in the U.S.S.R. created an environment in which psychiatric abuse occurred, including for nonmedical reasons."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Anastasi, [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/18/world/soviets-conditionally-readmitted-to-world-psychiatric-association.html Soviets Conditionally Readmitted To World Psychiatric Association], ''New York Times'' (October 18, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2017|post=,}} [[Helen Herrman]] is president, and Afzal Javed is president-elect.&lt;ref name=executive&gt;{{cite web |title=The Executive Committee |website=World Psychiatric Association |url=http://www.wpanet.org/detail.php?section_id=5&amp;content_id=46 |access-date=27 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
