__NOTOC__
Year '''455 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Vaticanus and Cicurinus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 299 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 455 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* [[Athens]], under Athenian general [[Tolmides]], sends 100 ships around the [[Peloponnesus]] and they set fire to the [[Sparta]]n naval base at [[Gythion]]. As a result, Athens gains the agreement of the [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaean]] cities to join the [[Delian League]]. Athenian forces then go on to attack the Spartan allies on the [[Corinthian Gulf]]. Athens is now able to confine Sparta to the southern Peloponnesus.
* The Athenians suffer a severe defeat in [[Egypt]] at the hands of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]]. After being cut off in the [[Nile Delta]], the Athenian fleet is defeated, and the Athenian army retreats across the [[Sinai Desert]] to [[Byblos]] before its remnants are rescued. The Egyptian rebel [[Inaros II|Inaros]] is crucified by the Persians. The Athenians decide against any further military activity in Egypt.

=== By topic ===
==== Literature ====
* [[Euripides]] presents his earliest known [[tragedy]], ''[[Peliades]]'', in the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[festival]] of [[Dionysia]].

Because of the large turnout of participation, drawing attendance from over 20 countries; numerous airlines, both domestic and foreign; and leading [[Africa]] hotel chains, attracting more than 10, 000 attendance,

With its growing popular demand and increased sales growth of exhibiting companies and participants from trade sales made from contacts during Akwaaba  African Travel Market, organizers have over the years maintain the vision of AFTM in sustaining economic growth in the [[ travel]] market in the [[Africa]] region.

 We are thinking about the return on investment. If the investor invests thousands of dollars coming to Akwaaba exhibition, we ask how much they make from the contacts generated at the exhibition. The return on investments for most of our exhibitors have been very high. We have changed from model of asking for the return of investment after 12 months to calculating the numbers of done deals'',said [[Ikechi Uko]], CEO Akwaaba African Travel Limited, describing the sales trade of exhibitors at Akwaaba African Travel Market.&lt;ref name="Oken-Ekong" /&gt;

The first Akwaaba African Travel Market (AFTM) was held in Lagos in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Yunus S. Saliu [http://archive.observer.gm/africa/gambia/article/2008/6/11/the-4th-edition-of-akwaaba-travel-market-lagos/ "The Fourth Edition of Akwaaba Travel Market Lagos'' ''[[The Daily Observer]]''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122005148/http://archive.observer.gm/africa/gambia/article/2008/6/11/the-4th-edition-of-akwaaba-travel-market-lagos/# |date=2015-11-22 }}, 11 July 2008. Retrieved on 21 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It came as a result of the rebranding of the name of the Travelers Awards and Exhibitions, which was launched in 2004. Subsequent editions have been held in Lagos.On why the name Akwaaba, Ikecji Uko, organizer, explained: ''We wanted a welcome name for Africa because we are hosting the event in Nigeria., so we chose a non- Nigerian word to represent Africa. We either had to choose JABAMA or AKWAABA. Akwaaba has its origin from [[Ghana]] and [[Cote d’Ivoire]]. It means welcome.'' 

In 2005- 2008 From the participation of two countries, Ghana and Sao Tome,  coming to Nigeria for the event in the debut year in 2005 to increasing number of active exhibitors and participants from other African countries in subsequent editions , Akwaaba African Travel Market is widely seen as the main designated travel market in Africa

In 2009 the 5th edition was held at the Eko Hotels and Suites in Lagos from 24th -25th  October with 15 participating African countries including Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Egypt and Gambia. Various organizations in the hospitality, travel and tourism sectors from these countries were exhibitors.

Dauda Jawara; former vice-president of Nigeria, Dr. Alex Ekweume;  the Director- General of Nigeria Tourism development Corporation (NTDC), Segun Runsewe and the governor of Cross River state, Senator LIyel Imoke.
The event was a platform for business networking, technical and practical knowledge towards development in the industry and trade sales worth millions were negotiated by the exhibitors and investors.

In 2010 the 6th edition  drew exhibitors from major airlines, travel agencies, hotels and tourism companies.  Africa Travel Association (ATA) and the World Bank also participated.

Danny Jardaan; the Secreatry- General of Egypt’s  Supreme Council of Antiquities, prof.

In 2017 the 13th edition revamped with new event features and awards category. Awards were given to one hundred African women in the travel industry. On why The Award was instituted, the organizer, Ikechi Uko said “Seventy percent of people working in the tourism are women, twenty percent are in the management position. Regrettably, only a paltry five percent of this huge figure could be found in the decision making positions. The Award is to encourage them to continue to strive for excellence in driving economic growth to Africa through tourism  and the travel industry’’.
Akwaaba chef challenge and Food fair 2017 were new event features during the 13th edition. The culinary event was aimed to promote culinary tourism from West Africa to the world.

'''''Bat Masterson''''' is an American [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[television series]] which showed a fictionalized account of the life of real-life marshal/gambler/dandy [[Bat Masterson]].  The title character was played by [[Gene Barry]] and the half-hour black-and-white shows ran on [[NBC]] from 1958 to 1961. The series was produced by [[Ziv Television Programs|Ziv Television Productions]]. ''Bat'' is a nickname for Masterson's first name, Bartholemew.

==Overview==
The show took a tongue-in-cheek outlook, with Barry's Masterson often dressed in expensive Eastern clothing and preferring to use his cane rather than a gun to get himself out of trouble. Masterson was also portrayed as a ladies' man who traveled the West looking for women and adventure.

The black derby, fancy decorative vest, black jacket, and elegant pearl-tipped cane were his trademarks. Miniaturized versions were marketed to children as [[tie-in]] products during the run of the show.&lt;ref&gt;http://sentimental-journeys.com/2010/02/08/bat-masterson-cane--derby-hat--comic-book-ad.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kevin Hagen]] appeared as Ace Williams in "The Fourth Man" (1961). [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] played the role of Rance Fletcher in "Bat Trap" (1961).

===Development===
The series was loosely based on Richard O'Connor's 1957 biography of Masterson.&lt;ref&gt;Robert K. Dearment. ''Bat Masterson: The Man and the Legend''. University of Oklahoma Press , 1989. p.9&lt;/ref&gt; This was highlighted by the book's front cover being shown at the end of the closing credits with an onscreen notation "based on".

From 1955 to 1959, [[Mason Alan Dinehart]] played a 20-something Bat Masterson in thirty-four episodes of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Desilu]] western series, ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'', starring [[Hugh O'Brian]] as the frontier peace officer [[Wyatt Earp]]. Dinehart left the series, and Barry was hence cast as a 40-something Masterson in a separate series on a different network. In the year 1958-1959 both actors were featured in the role of Masterson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047750/fullcredits#cast|title=Full Cast and Crew for ''The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp''|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Blind Faith''''' is a 1990 [[NBC]] [[miniseries]] based on the 1989 [[true crime]] [[Blind Faith (book)|book of the same name]] by [[Joe McGinniss]]. It follows the 1984 case in which American businessman [[Robert O. Marshall]] was charged with (and later convicted of) the [[contract killing]] of his wife, Maria. Adapted by [[John Gay (screenwriter)|John Gay]] and directed by [[Paul Wendkos]], the miniseries was originally broadcast in two parts with a total runtime of 190 minutes.

The cast includes [[Robert Urich]], [[Joanna Kerns]], [[Doris Roberts]], [[Johnny Galecki]], [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]] and [[Dennis Farina]].

== Plot ==
In [[Toms River, New Jersey]], the Marshalls — Rob (Urich) and Maria (Kerns), and their three sons, 18-year-old Roby (Barry Gray), 17-year-old Chris ([[Jay Underwood]]) and 12-year-old John ([[Johnny Galecki]]) — are an apparently happy family living the [[American Dream]]. But in September 1984, Maria is shot and killed, and Rob claims she was murdered by a robber while he was changing a flat tire. When the police commence their investigations, however, they discover unsettling truths about the Marshalls: Rob has secretly accumulated an enormous debt and has secured a [[second mortgage]] of $100,000 in Maria's name, and is having an affair with a married neighbor, Felice Richmond ([[Robin Strasser]]). Maria had known of the affair, and had considered divorce but decided to work on their marriage shortly before she was killed.

Felice gives the police a statement that Rob wanted to get rid of his wife to collect on her life insurance, and he immediately becomes the prime suspect. At first, Rob's friends and sons support him. But they begin to notice that he does not seem to be in mourning over Maria's death, and Rob's best friend Sal ([[Joe Spano]]) is angry that he is more interested in building a future with Felice. Rob is advised by his lawyer not to contact Felice because it could influence his image; this troubles Rob, who is deeply in love with her. Meanwhile, the police have expanded their list of suspects to include Andrew Meyers (Jake Dengel), a Louisiana shop clerk who had contact with Rob concerning his financial problems, and Arnie Eggers, a rumored hitman.

As all evidence seems to point to Rob, Felice breaks off their relationship, which leads him to unsuccessfully attempt suicide in a motel. By this point, Chris admits for the first time that he suspects his father might in fact be guilty. Roby and John are both shocked to hear this, strongly believing in their father's innocence. Rob admits to Sal that he hired Ferlin L'Heureux ([[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]]), a private detective, on the night his wife was killed to find out how he lost all of his money. Roby has trouble coping with a recent newspaper article in which his mother's personal life has been attacked. Upset, he is almost involved in a car accident. The police find an audio tape which Rob recorded shortly before he attempted to kill himself. On tape, he speaks about L'Hereux, who in turn claims that Ricky Dunlap ([[David Andrews (actor)|David Andrews]]) was the man hired to murder Maria. On Christmas Eve, Rob is arrested. Roby visits him in jail and is assured by his father that he is not guilty.

The trial begins at the Atlantic Courthouse in 1986. L'Hereux gives detailed testimony in which he claims that Rob hired him to murder Maria so that Marshall could collect on her insurance. L'Hereux states that he found her too beautiful to kill, and contacted Ricky Dunlap to finish the job. Under extreme pressure from the trial, Roby and John are unable to hide their emotions, and Chris turns into an angry young man wanting justice to be served. When the moment comes that Rob asks Roby to give false testimony which would provide him an alibi, it becomes clear to Roby that his father is not the person he thought him to be.

Dunlap is found not guilty. The entire blame goes to Rob, disparaged by prosecuting attorney Kelly ([[Dennis Farina]]) as "a legend in his own mind" whom he considers many times worse than Dunlap, even if he was not the one who performed the actual murder. Rob is sentenced to death by [[lethal injection]]. The narration reveals that, in 1990, Rob is on [[death row]], waiting for appeal; Roby finished college; Chris became a varsity swim coach; and John, who married at age 17, never stopped believing in his father's innocence.

'''''Born Free''''' is a 1966 [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] drama film starring [[Virginia McKenna]] and [[Bill Travers]] as [[Joy Adamson|Joy]] and [[George Adamson]], a real-life couple who raised [[Elsa the Lioness]], an orphaned lion cub, to adulthood, and released her into the wilderness of [[Kenya]]. The film was produced by Open Road Films Ltd. and [[Columbia Pictures]]. The screenplay, written by [[Hollywood Blacklist|blacklisted]] Hollywood writer [[Lester Cole]] (under the pseudonym "Gerald L.C. Copley"), was based upon Joy Adamson's 1960 non-fiction book ''[[Born Free (book)|Born Free]]''. The film was directed by [[James Hill (British director)|James Hill]] and produced by [[Sam Jaffe (producer)|Sam Jaffe]] and [[Paul Radin]].  ''Born Free'', and its [[Film score|musical score]] by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]], won numerous awards.

==Plot==
When George Adamson is forced to kill a [[lion]], after the lion kills a native villager, and then George kills a lioness out of self-defence, he brings home the three orphaned cubs she had been trying to protect. The Adamsons tend to the three orphaned lion cubs to young lionhood, and, when the time comes, the two largest are sent to the [[Diergaarde Blijdorp|Rotterdam Zoo]], while [[Elsa the Lioness]] (the smallest of the litter) remains with Joy. When Elsa is held responsible for stampeding a herd of elephants through a village, John Kendall, Adamson's boss, gives the couple three months to either rehabilitate Elsa to the wild, or send her to a zoo. Joy opposes sending Elsa to a zoo, and spends much time attempting to reintroduce Elsa to the life of a wild lion in a distant reserve. At last, she succeeds, and with mixed feelings and a breaking heart, she returns her friend to the wild. The Adamsons then depart for their home in England; a year later they return to Kenya for a week, hoping to find Elsa. They do, and happily discover she hasn't forgotten them and is the mother of three cubs. The Adamsons made an agreement not to handle the cubs, in contrast to the way they did with Elsa.

* [[Bill Travers]] as George Adamson

The film's credits list lions and lionesses Boy, Girl, Henrietta, [[Mara the Lioness|Mara]], Ugas, and "the Cubs".

==Production==

The film reunited the real life couple Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna as a couple first seen together in ''[[The Smallest Show on Earth]]'' in 1957.

George Adamson served as chief technical advisor on the film and discusses his involvement in his first autobiography, ''Bwana Game'' (UK title, 1968), known in the US as ''A Lifetime with Lions''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fatheroflions.org/Bibliography.html Bibliography – BooksFilmsMovies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ben Mankiewicz]], who introduces the film on [[Turner Classic Movies]], the production unit mainly used wild lions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The making of the film was a life-changing experience for actors [[Virginia McKenna]] and her husband [[Bill Travers]], who became [[animal rights]] activists and were instrumental in creating the [[Born Free Foundation]].

One of the lions in the film was played by a former [[mascot]] of the [[Scots Guards]], who had to leave him behind when they left Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=21AEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;q=scots%20guards%20%2B%20born%20free |title=LIFE – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.au |date=28 November 1969 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The producers also acknowledged the help received from Emperor [[Haile Selassie I|Haile Selassie]] of Ethiopia and the [[Uganda Game and Fisheries Department|Game Department of Uganda]].

==Critical response and box-office==
''Born Free'' received critical acclaim. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 92 percent of 12 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Born Free|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/born_free/|work=[[Flixster]]|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vincent Canby]] waxed enthusiastic about the film, writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Almost from the opening shot – a vast expanse of corn-coloured African plain where lions feed on the carcass of a freshly killed zebra – one knows that Joy Adamson's best-selling book ''Born Free'' has been entrusted to honest, intelligent filmmakers. Without minimising the facts of animal life or overly sentimentalising them, this film casts an enchantment that is just about irresistible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Canby|first=Vincent|title=The Screen: Honesty and Humor Make 'Born Free' a Fresh and Moving Film:Biography of Lion Has Documentary Flavor|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E01EFD61231E53ABC4B51DFB066838D679EDE|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=18 December 2012|date=23 June 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels and spinoffs==
The book ''Born Free'' (1960) was followed by two other books, ''Living Free'' (1961) and ''Forever Free'' (1963). In 1972, a film sequel entitled ''[[Living Free]]'' was released. While deriving its name from the second book, the film was based on the third book in the series. It starred [[Susan Hampshire]] and [[Nigel Davenport]] as Joy and George Adamson.

A documentary follow-up to ''Born Free'', entitled ''The Lions Are Free'', was released in 1969. The film follows ''Born Free''-actor [[Bill Travers]] as he journeys to a remote area in [[Kenya]] to visit [[George Adamson]], and several of Adamson's lion friends.

In 1974, a 13-episode American television series was broadcast by [[NBC]], entitled ''[[Born Free (TV series)|Born Free]]'', starring [[Diana Muldaur]] and [[Gary Collins (actor)|Gary Collins]] as Joy and George Adamson. The series was later followed by television film in 1996 called ''[[Born Free: A New Adventure]]'', with [[Linda Purl]] and [[Chris Noth]]. Joy and George Adamson do not appear as the main characters in the story.

''[[To Walk with Lions]]'' (1999) depicts the last years of George Adamson's life, as seen through the eyes of his assistant, [[Tony Fitzjohn]]. George is portrayed by [[Richard Harris]], and [[Honor Blackman]] makes a brief appearance as Joy.

The one-hour ''[[Nature (TV series)|Nature]]'' documentary ''Elsa's Legacy: The Born Free Story'' was released on [[PBS]] stations in January 2011. It includes a collection of archival footage and an exploration into the lives of Joy and George Adamson during the years following release of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ray|first=Rachel|title=Elsa's Legacy: The Born Free Story, Nature on PBS – US TV review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8246070/Elsas-Legacy-The-Born-Free-Story-Nature-on-PBS-US-TV-review.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=18 December 2012|date=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal law}}
At [[law]], '''cheating''' is a specific [[criminal offence]] relating to [[property]].

Historically, to cheat was to commit a [[misdemeanour]] at [[common law]].  However, in most [[jurisdiction]]s, the offence has now been codified into statute.&lt;ref&gt;In [[Florida]] cheating remains a criminal offence by virtue of Fla. Stat. § 775.01 which provides that [[English common law]] crimes are crimes in Florida, but a specific [[statutory penalty]] for cheating is supplied by Fla. Stat. § 817.29&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases the codified statutory form of cheating and the original common law offence are very similar, however there can be differences.  For example, under [[English law]] it was held in ''R. v. Sinclair''&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Sinclair'' [1968] 3 All 241&lt;/ref&gt; that "[t]o cheat and defraud is to act with deliberate dishonesty to the prejudice of another person's proprietary right."  However, at common law a great deal of authority suggested that there had to be contrivance, such that the public were likely to be deceived and that "common prudence and caution are not sufficient security against a person being defrauded thereby".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Halsbury's Laws of England]]'', 2nd ed., Vol IX, para 944 citing various older common law cases&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of cheating upheld by the courts have included fraudulently pretending to have power to discharge a soldier,&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Serlested'' (1627) Lat 202&lt;/ref&gt; using false weights or measures,&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Closs'' (1857) Dears &amp; B 460&lt;/ref&gt; and playing with false dice.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Maddocke'' (1619) 2 Roll Rep 107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
In relation to the common law offence, no judicial definition of the offence was ever laid down, but the description of the offence set down in ''[[Stephen's Criminal Digest]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Stephen's Criminal Digest'', 9th Ed., 362&lt;/ref&gt; is regarded as fairly comprehensive, and is cited as an authoritative definition by ''[[Stroud's Judicial Dictionary]]''.

{{quote|Every one commits the misdemeanour called cheating who fraudulently obtains the property of another by any deceitful practice not amounting to [[felony]], which practice is of such a nature that it directly affects, or may directly affect, the public at large.  But it is not cheating, within the meaning of this article, to deceive any person in any contract or private dealing by lies, unaccompanied by such practices as aforesaid.}}

==Other statutory uses==
A number of jurisdictions also have statutory offences relating to cheating in [[gambling]].  See for example section 42(3) of the [[Gambling Act 2005]].

==England and Wales==
The common law offence of cheating was abolished, except as regards offences relating to the [[public revenue]], by section 32(1)(a) of the [[Theft Act 1968]].

===Cheating the public revenue===
William Harkins said that "all frauds affecting the Crown and public at large are indictable as cheats at common law".&lt;ref&gt;William Hawkins. ''[[Hawkins' Treatise of Pleas of the Crown|Treatise of Pleas of the Crown]]''. Eighth Edition. Page 1322&lt;/ref&gt; This passage was cited in ''R. v. Mulligan''.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Mulligan'' [1990] Crim LR 427&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutions under the common law are still pursued in England and can result in heavy sentences – significantly in excess of the maximum available to the courts for corresponding statutory offences.&lt;ref&gt;David Winch, [http://www.accountingevidence.com/blog/2012/07/17-year-sentence-for-vat-carousel-fraud/ "17 Year sentence for VAT carousel fraud"] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The following cases are also relevant:
*''R v Hudson''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Hudson'', [1956] 2 QB 252, [1956] 2 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 914, [1956] 1 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 814, 40 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 55, [1956] [[Criminal Law Review|Crim LR]] 814&lt;/ref&gt;
*''R v Mavji''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Mavji'', [1987] 2 All ER 758, 84 Cr App R 34, [1987] Crim LR 39, CA&lt;/ref&gt;
*''R v Redford''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Redford'', 89 Cr App R 1, [1989] Crim LR 152, CA&lt;/ref&gt;
*''R v Hunt''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Hunt'', [1994] Crim LR 747, CA&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sentence====
See ''R v Regan'''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Regan'', 11 [[Criminal Appeal Reports (Sentencing)|Cr App R (S)]] 15, CA&lt;/ref&gt; ''Attorney General's References (Nos. 88, 89, 98 and 91 of 2006)'' and ''R v Meehan and others''.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Meehan and others'', [2006] [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] (D) 105&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cheating at play===
This offence was formally created by section 17 of the [[Gaming Act 1845]]. The current English legislation on cheating in betting is found in s42 Gambling Act 2005.

===Going equipped for cheat===
Before 15 January 2007, in section 25 of the [[Theft Act 1968]], the word "cheat" meant an offence under section 15 of that Act.&lt;ref&gt;Theft Act 1968, section 25(5)&lt;/ref&gt; The said section 15 created the offence of [[obtaining property by deception]].

The '''Clark-Naumann agreement''' between [[NATO]] and [[FR Yugoslavia]] (FRY) provided for the partial withdrawal of FRY forces (VJ) and Serbian forces (MUP) from [[AP Kosovo and Metohija]], the limitation of new forces, and deployment of [[OSCE]] verifiers (the [[Kosovo Verification Mission]]). NATO and FRY representatives met on 25 October 1998 to discuss steps for full compliance with [[UNSCR 1199]] (23 September 1998). It was signed by [[Nikola Šainović]], Vice Prime Minister of FRY government.

{{United Kingdom in the European Union}}
The '''2016 Conservative Party leadership election''' occurred as a result of [[David Cameron]]'s resignation as leader following the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|European Union membership referendum]], in which the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU. Cameron, who supported Britain's continued membership of the EU, made his announcement on 24 June, saying that he would step down by October. [[Theresa May]] won the contest on 11 July 2016, after the withdrawal of [[Andrea Leadsom]] left her as the sole candidate, succeeding Cameron as [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|leader]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].

Conservative MPs had voted initially in a series of ballots to determine which two candidates' names would go forward to a nationwide ballot of Conservative Party members, who would make the final decision. Five Conservative members of Parliament (MPs) put themselves forward as candidates: [[Secretary of State for Justice|Justice Secretary]] [[Michael Gove]], [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions|Work and Pensions Secretary]] [[Stephen Crabb]], former [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]] [[Liam Fox]], [[Department of Energy and Climate Change|Minister of State for Energy and Climate Change]] Andrea Leadsom, and [[Home Secretary]] Theresa May. Former [[Mayor of London]] [[Boris Johnson]], seen as the front runner by political analysts, surprised many commentators by choosing not to run after Gove withdrew his backing and announced his own candidacy.

In the first-round ballot, May, gaining the support of half of Conservative MPs, was placed first with Leadsom at second place. Fox was eliminated on the first ballot; Crabb withdrew later that day. Gove was eliminated in the second round of voting. Before the Conservative Party members were due to cast their votes, Leadsom withdrew from the contest on 11 July. May was appointed party leader later that day, and Prime Minister on 13 July. She appointed Johnson, Fox and Leadsom to her [[First May ministry|Cabinet]], respectively as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[Secretary of State for International Trade]], and [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]].

==Background==
During the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]] campaign, [[David Cameron]], then leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister, announced that he would not seek a third term; he was therefore expected to stand down before the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|following general election]]—at that time, expected to occur in 2020—although he spoke of serving a full term.&lt;ref name="Tele2020"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirkup|first1=James|title=By 2020, the Conservative Party leader will be... not who you expect|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/politics-blog/11492947/By-2020-the-Conservative-Party-leader-will-be-.-.-.-not-who-you-expect.html|date=25 March 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813155834/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/politics-blog/11492947/By-2020-the-Conservative-Party-leader-will-be-.-.-.-not-who-you-expect.html|archivedate=13 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a manifesto commitment, Cameron and the Conservative Party introduced legislation for a [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union]], which was held on 23 June 2016. Cameron and the Government supported a Remain vote, although the Conservative Party was officially neutral in the campaign and many Conservative politicians, including some Cabinet members, campaigned to Leave. There was speculation during the campaign as to whether Cameron would resign if Leave won, but on the day of the referendum, both Leave- and Remain-supporting Conservatives called for him to stay whatever the result.

A Leave win was announced on the morning of 24 June 2016, and Cameron announced shortly afterward that he would be stepping down. He said that he would continue in post while the leadership election was ongoing, with the new leader to be in place in time for the party conference in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Cameron announces his resignation – full statement|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/david-cameron-announces-his-resignation---full-statement/|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=29 June 2016|date=24 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629101002/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/david-cameron-announces-his-resignation---full-statement/|archivedate=29 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the way in which events unfolded resulted in his much earlier departure.

The campaign was framed by whether candidates had supported Remain or Leave; initial speculation by some analysts was that a Leave supporter would be more likely to win.&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Politics'', BBC, 26 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Based on media speculation, the front runners on 29 June were [[Boris Johnson]] (Leave) and [[Theresa May]] (Remain),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cooper |first=Charlie |date=29 June 2016 |title=Boris Johnson and Theresa May rally support for Tory leadership race |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-leadership-race-boris-johnson-theresa-may-new-prime-minister-7108171.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London, UK |access-date=29 June 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628231645/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-leadership-race-boris-johnson-theresa-may-new-prime-minister-7108171.html |archivedate=28 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Johnson the early favourite.

Gove, previously seen as a key ally of the Johnson campaign, announced his own candidacy three hours before nominations closed, stating that he had reluctantly come to the conclusion that Johnson could not "provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead."

By 5 July 2016, Gove was in a distant third place in the leadership race based on the number of endorsements received from other MPs. He was eliminated in the second MPs' ballot.

A post-contest analysis in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' noted that the £275,000 contributions to Theresa May's campaign "dwarfed her rivals", and Cameron's original honours list contained the names of two major Conservative party donors who supported her campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/04/theresa-may-pulled-in-21000-a-day-in-donations-to-her-successful/|title=Theresa May drawn into David Cameron honours row after she accepted £35,000 from Tory donors whose names were taken off list|work=Daily Telegraph|author=Christopher Hope|date=4 August 2016|accessdate=8 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916020445/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/04/theresa-may-pulled-in-21000-a-day-in-donations-to-her-successful/|archivedate=16 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign and key issues==
The initial days of the campaign remained overshadowed by the fallout from Gove's entry into the race and Johnson's departure. May gathered the most support from MPs early on. [[Gavin Williamson]]—later to be appointed [[Chief Whip of the Conservative Party|Chief Whip]] by May—was her parliamentary campaign manager and responsible for rallying this support, together with a small group of MPs including [[Julian Smith (politician)|Julian Smith]], [[Kris Hopkins]], [[Simon Kirby]], [[Karen Bradley]] and [[George Hollingbery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/entertainment/weekend/2016/07/18/interview-chief-whip-gavin-williamson-mp-on-his-factory-worker-beginnings-and-recent-promotion/|title=Interview: Chief Whip Gavin Williamson MP on his factory worker beginnings and recent promotion « Express &amp; Star|website=www.expressandstar.com|access-date=2016-09-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919225909/http://www.expressandstar.com/entertainment/weekend/2016/07/18/interview-chief-whip-gavin-williamson-mp-on-his-factory-worker-beginnings-and-recent-promotion/|archivedate=19 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the initial days of the campaign, Leadsom said that she would not rule out involving [[Nigel Farage]], then the leader of the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP), in Brexit negotiations; the May campaign criticised Leadsom for claimed UKIP links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-36570120 |title=Nigel Farage quits – and Conservative leadership race |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=4 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630001335/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-36570120 |archivedate=30 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leadsom had approached the Johnson campaign with a proposed deal not to run in exchange for being made one of his top three ministers. Johnson agreed to the deal, but was too late in communicating the decision, and Leadsom chose to run for leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/why-michael-gove-s-plotting-led-to-boris-johnsons-downfall-a3287406.html|title=Why Michael Gove's plotting led to Boris Johnson's downfall|date=4 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704123608/http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/why-michael-gove-s-plotting-led-to-boris-johnsons-downfall-a3287406.html|archivedate=4 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All five candidates for the Conservative leadership said that they would not call an early [[General elections in the United Kingdom|general election]], relying instead on the Conservative mandate secured at the 2015 election.&lt;ref name="5Questions"&gt;Tim Ross, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/02/tory-leadership-battle-five-questions-for-five-contenders---here/ Tory leadership battle: Five questions for five contenders – here's how they replied] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705152401/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/02/tory-leadership-battle-five-questions-for-five-contenders---here/ |date=5 July 2016 }}, ''The Daily Telegraph'' (2 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The five candidates also rejected the idea of calling a second referendum on British withdrawal from the EU, pledging to take the UK out of the Union, although on different timeframes.&lt;ref name="5Questions"/&gt;

Among the key issues that emerged during the Conservative leadership campaign were:

*The status of [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] living in the UK. The government stated following the EU referendum that the long-term status of EU nationals living in the UK and UK nationals living elsewhere in the EU would be a question for the next government, with the current government saying only that there would be "no immediate change" to EU nationals' status.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Walker, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/04/government-refuses-guarantee-eu-citizens-living-in-uk-can-stay Government refuses to guarantee EU citizens living in UK can stay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113221203/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/04/government-refuses-guarantee-eu-citizens-living-in-uk-can-stay |date=13 November 2016 }}, ''The Guardian'' (4 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36707573 Brexit: Rights of EU citizens living in UK sparks row] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705214143/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36707573 |date=5 July 2016 }}, BBC News (4 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; May suggested that the status of EU citizens living in the UK could be part of exit negotiations; the other four Conservative leadership candidates opposed this notion, saying that EU nationals living in the UK should not be "negotiating chips" and pledging to allow EU nationals to remain in the country if chosen as prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36701856 Andrea Leadsom: EU citizens in UK are not bargaining chips] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705132922/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36701856 |date=5 July 2016 }}, BBC News (5 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial in ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that the Brexit-dominated leadership campaign presented a danger that the next prime minister would be chosen on this basis at a time when several major domestic issues would also demand the prime minister's attention, such as the disputes between the government and unions representing teachers and [[junior doctor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/05/the-guardian-view-on-the-next-prime-minister-in-tray-much-more-than-brexit The Guardian view on the next PM's in-tray: much more than Brexit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706162942/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/05/the-guardian-view-on-the-next-prime-minister-in-tray-much-more-than-brexit |date=6 July 2016 }}, ''The Guardian'' (5 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election procedure==
The election process for selecting the [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|leader of the Conservative Party]] is overseen by the Conservative [[1922 Committee]], although election procedures are approved by the Board of the Conservative Party.&lt;ref name="WilkinsonElectionProcedure"&gt;Michael Wilkinson, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/who-will-be-our-next-prime-minister-as-david-cameron-resigns-fol/ Who will be our next Prime Minister as David Cameron resigns following EU Referendum defeat?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624152126/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/who-will-be-our-next-prime-minister-as-david-cameron-resigns-fol/ |date=24 June 2016 }}, ''The Daily Telegraph'' (24 June 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCWhoMight"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36618738 Conservative leader: Who might succeed David Cameron?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627023105/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36618738 |date=27 June 2016 }}, BBC News (24 June 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.conservatives.com/Members/Party-Structure-and-Organisation Party Structure and Organisation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005230159/https://www.conservatives.com/Members/Party-Structure-and-Organisation |date=5 October 2016 }}, Conservative and Unionist Party (accessed 24 June 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Nominations for the leadership are invited by the Chairman of the 1922 Committee ([[Graham Brady]] at the time), acting as Returning Officer for all stages of the election. Candidates must be proposed and seconded in writing, with names of the proposers and seconders being published. When nominations close, a list of valid nominations is published. If there is only one valid nomination, that person is declared elected. If only two valid nominations are received, both names go forward to the general membership of the Party. If more than two nominations are received, a ballot is held within the Parliamentary Party on the Tuesday immediately following the closing date for nominations. An [[exhaustive ballot]] system is used to select two candidates to go forward to the general membership of the Party.

A ballot paper is produced and issued to all Conservative Members in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], who indicate one choice from the candidates listed. [[Proxy voting|Proxy votes]] are possible. The ballot is conducted [[Secret ballot|in secret]]. If there are three candidates in the first ballot, the two who receive the most votes go forward to the general membership. If there are more than three, the candidate receiving the fewest votes is eliminated and a second ballot, under the same rules, is held the following Thursday. If there are no more than three candidates in the second ballot, the two receiving the most votes go forward to the general membership. If a third ballot is required, it is held the following Tuesday. This process is repeated as often as necessary, on alternate Tuesdays and Thursdays. When a ballot with only three candidates is reached, the two candidates who receive the highest number of votes go forward to the general membership. Candidates may withdraw their names at any time, "up to 24 hours of the opening of the ballot", but no new nominations will be accepted after the first ballot.

The two candidates selected by the Parliamentary Party are then put to the full membership of the Party (specifically, "all the members of the Conservative Party in good standing who have been members for not less than three months prior to the date of the announcement of the Vote of Confidence") in a postal ballot. Each Party member, on a "[[one member, one vote]]" basis, may vote for their preferred candidate. It is not explicitly stated in the rules from when the three months applies, in the eventuality of the leader resigning, but Rule 5 in the "Rules for the Election of the Leader" (which appears as Schedule 2 to the Constitution of the Conservative Party) gives this as "immediately prior to the close of the ballot for the election of the Leader".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN01366/SN01366.pdf|title=Leadership Elections: Conservative Party|last=Kelly|first=Richard|last2=Lester|first2=Paul|date=7 December 2005|website=|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|access-date=25 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820172114/https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN01366/SN01366.pdf|archivedate=20 August 2016|df=dmy-all}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chairman of the 1922 Committee consults with the Board of the Conservative Party to agree the closing date for the ballot, which will be "as soon as practicable" after the date of the last ballot in the Parliamentary Party. The chairman, as returning officer, shall agree with the Board who is responsible, under his direction, for the receipt and counting of the votes, and the chairman announces the results "as soon as practicable" to a meeting of the Parliamentary Party and representatives of the Conservative Party.

Should only a single candidate be nominated, or all but one candidate be eliminated or withdraw before the scheduled end of the election (set in this instance as 9 September 2016), that single (or remaining) candidate is elected effectively unopposed without—if applicable—the votes of the party membership being issued (or counted if the ballot papers have already been issued).

==Results==
The first ballot of MPs was held on 5 July. The results were announced at 18:30 by 1922 Committee chairman Graham Brady. May placed first, far ahead of her closest rival Leadsom. Fifth-placed candidate Fox was knocked out of the race, and Crabb withdrew following scandalous revelations about his private life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/stephen-crabbs-ambitions-derailed-sex-11595927|title=Stephen Crabb's ambitions may be derailed by sex texts scandal|last=Williamson|first=David|date=2016-07-11|work=walesonline|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;; both endorsed May.

However, on 11 July, Leadsom withdrew from the race, saying it is in the “best interests of the country”, leaving May as the only candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/conservative-leadership-andrea-leadsom-pulls-out-of-race|title=Andrea Leadsom pulls out of Conservative leadership race|last=|first=|date=11 July 2016|website=The Guardian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625061303/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/conservative-leadership-andrea-leadsom-pulls-out-of-race|archive-date=25 June 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=10 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative MP and Chairman of the 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, announced that May would be confirmed as Conservative Party leader as soon as the party's board had been consulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2016-07-11/theresa-may-set-to-be-confirmed-as-new-leader-of-conservative-party/ |title=May set to be confirmed as new leader of Tory Party |publisher=Itv.com |accessdate=11 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814225054/http://www.itv.com/news/update/2016-07-11/theresa-may-set-to-be-confirmed-as-new-leader-of-conservative-party/ |archivedate=14 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was confirmed as leader; David Cameron tendered his resignation as Prime Minister on 13 July, with May accepting the Queen's invitation to succeed him shortly afterwards. Having been appointed Prime Minister, she entered [[10 Downing Street]] with a speech emphasising the term Unionist in the name of the party, reminding all of "the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-36789572 |title=Theresa May: Word unionist 'very important to me' |date=13 July 2016 |publisher=BBC |access-date=14 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160714214126/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-36789572 |archivedate=14 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After she became Prime Minister, May's cabinet appointments tilted to the right, according to ''The Guardian''; but her speech clearly targeted the left, with a promise to combat the "burning injustice" in British society and create a union "between all of our citizens" and promising to be an advocate for the "ordinary working-class family" and not for the affluent in the UK. "The government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few but by yours. We will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives. ... When we take the big calls, we'll think not of the powerful, but you. When we pass new laws we'll listen not to the mighty, but to you. When it comes to taxes we'll prioritise not the wealthy but you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Heather |date=14 July 2016 |title=Theresa May appeals to centre ground but cabinet tilts to the right |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |access-date=14 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713235732/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister |archivedate=13 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic analysis ===
Analysis of the results of the second ballot by Jeffery et al., published in the journal ''[[Parliamentary Affairs]]'', have shown that Conservative MPs could be split into three electoral groups: Remain-backing Conservative MPs were more likely to support May, while Leave-backing MPs were split between socially-liberal Leave MPs, who were more likely to back Gove, and socially-conservative Leave MPs, who showed a greater propensity to vote for Leadsom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jeffery|first=David|last2=Heppell|first2=Tim|last3=Hayton|first3=Richard|last4=Crines|first4=Andrew|title=The Conservative Party Leadership Election of 2016: An Analysis of the Voting Motivations of Conservative Parliamentarians|url=https://academic.oup.com/pa/advance-article/doi/10.1093/pa/gsx027/4096453|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|doi=10.1093/pa/gsx027|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119131048/https://academic.oup.com/pa/advance-article/doi/10.1093/pa/gsx027/4096453|archivedate=19 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Copenhagen Puppet Festival''' is a biennial adult puppetry festival organized by Kulturanstalten, in the borough of [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]] in [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name="iam"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationalartsmanager.com/features/country-focus/denmark-copenhagen-puppet-festival.html|title=Denmark: Copenhagen Puppet Festival|last=Anderson|first=Andrew|date=3 July 2014|website=International Arts Manager|publisher=Lewis Business Media|access-date=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first [[Copenhagen]] [[Puppet]] Festival was held in 2006,&lt;ref Name="iam" /&gt; but Kulturanstalten have organized puppet events before this, such as ''[[Punch and Judy]] and the Brats'' in 2004, and ''Re:[[Frankenstein]]'' by Stuffed PuppetTheatre.

In 2006 four performances for young people and adults toured Kulturhuset [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]] (now Kulturanstalten), Kulturhuset [[Islands Brygge]], Vesterbro Bibliotek (Vesterbro Library, now Kulturanstalten), the [[Copenhagen Central Station|Central Train Station]], and bus 3A where they played a total of 12 shows. Among the performers were Moving People (UK/F). There was also a workshop aimed at teenagers, in collaboration with Teater Graense-Loes.

In 2007 the first Copenhagen Puppet Festival was organized, with a programme that included both adult and children performances. The festival presented performances from groups such as Pickled Image, Teater Graense-Loes, Garlic Theatre and La Cie Pairs et Fils. In addition Marcin Bikowskis performed at the Night Scene. The festival also presented talks, lectures and debates.

The festival was organized by Børnekulturstedet på Vesterbro (The Children's’ Culture Place in
Vesterbro), and in cooperation with Nordland Visual Theatre, Vesterbro Library, Teater Huset, and UNIMA Denmark.

In 2009 the festival had different focus on stage and off stage. The on stage focus was the good story told as simply as possible, and the visible puppeteer. The off stage programme focused on traditions and developments outside Denmark.

The performances was by groups such as Blind Summit Theatre, Stugu/Romme Produktioner, Ze Patrecathodics &amp; Cie, Vincent de Rooij, Compagnie Le Grand Manipule, Théâtre d’Ombre. The
Night Scene contributors were, among others, students from The London School of Puppetry and [[Ludwik Solski Academy for the Dramatic Arts]] in Cracow, Wroclaw Branch.

'''Counterfeit consumer goods''' are goods, often of inferior quality, made or sold under another's brand name without the brand owner’s authorization. Sellers of such goods may infringe on either the [[trademark]], [[patent]] or [[copyright]] of the brand owner by [[passing off]] its goods as made by the brand owner.&lt;ref name=Chaudhry&gt;Chaudhry, Peggy E., Zimmerman, Alan.

The term "knockoff" is often used interchangeably with "counterfeit", although their legal meanings are not identical. A "knockoff" is a colloquial term which describes products that copy or imitate the physical appearance of other products but which do not copy the brand name or logo of a trademark. They may still be illegal under trademark laws if they confuse consumers.&lt;ref name=intell&gt;[https://publish.illinois.edu/illinoisblj/2009/09/21/knock-off-the-knockoffs-the-fight-against-trademark-and-copyright-infringement/ "Knock-off the Knockoffs: The Fight Against Trademark and Copyright Infringement"], ''Illinois Business Law Journal'', Sept. 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Counterfeiters can include producers, distributors or retail sellers.&lt;ref name=intell/&gt; The term "pirated goods" refers to reproductions of copyrighted products without permission, such as music, movies or software.&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;''The Economic Impact of Counterfeiting and Piracy'', OECD (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|96}} Exact definitions are determined by the laws of various countries.

Growing over 10,000% in the last two decades, counterfeit products exist in virtually every industry sector, including food, beverages, apparel, accessories, footwear, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, electronics, auto parts, toys, and currency. The spread of counterfeit goods is worldwide, with the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC) in 2008 having estimated the global value of all counterfeit goods at $650 billion annually, increasing to $1.77 trillion by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Global Impacts Study {{!}} ICC - International Chamber of Commerce|url = http://www.iccwbo.org/Advocacy-Codes-and-Rules/BASCAP/BASCAP-Research/Economic-impact/Global-Impacts-Study/|website = www.iccwbo.org|access-date = 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries including the U.S., Italy and France are among the hardest hit, as their economies thrive on producing high-value products, protected by intellectual property rights and trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://financialtribune.com/articles/world-economy/88712/counterfeit-goods-shaving-billions-from-italian-economy "Counterfeit Goods Shaving Billions From Italian Economy"], ''Financial Tribune'', June 27, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; By 2017, the U.S. alone was estimated to be losing up to $600 billion each year to counterfeit goods, software piracy and the theft of copyrights and trade secrets.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;[https://www.inc.com/associated-press/counterfeiters-cost-600-billion-a-year.html "Counterfeit Goods Cost the U.S. $600 Billion a Year"], ''Inc'', AP, Feb. 27, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==General description==
According to ''[[Forbes]]'', in 2018 counterfeiting was the largest criminal enterprise in the world.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2018/03/29/meet-the-man-fighting-americas-trade-war-against-chinese-counterfeits/#37e412c61c0d "Meet The Man Fighting America's Trade War Against Chinese Counterfeits (It's Not Trump)"], ''Forbes'', March 29, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of counterfeit and pirated goods totals $1.7 trillion per year, which is more than drugs and human trafficking. It is expected to grow to $2.8 trillion and cost 5.4 million jobs by 2022.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; According to ''The Counterfeit Report'', "China produces 80% of the world's counterfeits and we're supporting China. Whether or not it's their intention to completely undermine and destroy the U.S. economy, we [in the United States] buy about 60% to 80% of the products."&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; It states:
{{quote|Companies spend millions or billions of dollars building brands, and building reputations and they're being completely destroyed by Chinese counterfeits. And when you take that across a universe of goods, Americans' confidence in their own products is nonexistent.

[[File:Counterfeits chart.jpg|thumb|Growth in seizures of counterfeit goods by the U.S.]]
The [[OECD]] states that counterfeit products encompass all products made to closely imitate the appearance of the product of another as to mislead consumers. Those can include the unauthorized production and distribution of products that are protected by intellectual property rights, such as copyright, trademarks, and trade names. Counterfeiters illegally copy trademarks, which manufacturers have built up based on marketing investments and the recognized quality of their products, in order to fool consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.zoll.de/english_version/d0_protection_property/a0_trademark/index.html|title=Combating trademark and product piracy|work= Zoll online|accessdate=2006-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any product that is protected by intellectual property rights is a target for counterfeiters.&lt;ref name=OECD-report/&gt; Piotr Stryszowski, a senior economist at OECD, notes that it is not only the scale of counterfeiting that is alarming, but its rapidly growing scope, which means that now any product with a logo can become a target.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/sale-fake-goods-hits-alarming-level "Sale of fake goods hits alarming level"], ''The Edge Markets'', April 2, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, different types of infringements overlap: unauthorized music copying mostly infringes copyright as well as trademarks; fake toys infringe design protection. The term "counterfeiting" therefore addresses the related issues of copying packaging, labeling, or any other significant features of the goods.&lt;ref name=OECD-report/&gt;

Among the leading industries that have been seriously affected by counterfeiting are software, music recordings, motion pictures, luxury goods and fashion clothes, sportswear, perfumes, toys, aircraft components, spare parts and car accessories, and pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name=OECD-report/&gt; Counterfeit pharmaceuticals are the most profitable sector of illegally copied goods, with lost revenues up to $217 billion per year. Fraudulent drugs are known to harm or kill millions around the world, thereby damaging the brand names and sales of major pharmaceutical manufacturers.&lt;ref name=Strategy&gt;[https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/reports/counterfeit-pharmaceuticals "Fighting counterfeit pharmaceuticals: New defenses for an underestimated - and growing - menace"], ''Strategy&amp;'', June 29, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Since counterfeits are produced illegally, they are not manufactured to comply with relevant safety standards. They will often use cheap, hazardous and unapproved materials or cut costs in some other manner. These unapproved materials can be hazardous to consumers, or the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Counterfeit goods: How to tell the real from the rip-off|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/05/counterfeit-goods-how-to-tell-real-from-ripoff/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growing problem===
It was estimated by the [[OECD]] that in 2013 counterfeit goods accounted for about $461 billion, or about 2.5% of total world trade. That estimate did not include either domestically produced and consumed products or digital products sold on the internet.&lt;ref name=OECD-report&gt;[https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/trade-in-counterfeit-and-pirated-goods_9789264252653-en#page68 "Trade in Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Mapping the Economic Impact"], OECD, April 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; That estimate rose from 1.8% of world trade in 2007. The OECD concluded that despite their improved interception technologies, "the problem of counterfeit and pirated trade has not diminished, but has become a major threat for modern knowledge-based economies."&lt;ref name=OECD-report/&gt;

In the U.S., despite coordinated efforts by [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] and [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) to stem the influx of counterfeit goods into the U.S, there was a 38% increase in counterfeits seized between 2012 and 2016.&lt;ref name=nextgov&gt;[https://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2018/03/us-customs-needs-share-more-info-counterfeits-online-retailers/146442/ "U.S. Customs Needs To Share More Info on Counterfeits With Online Retailers"], ''Nextgov'', March 6, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In a test survey by the [[GAO]] of various items purchased online of major brands, all of which stated they were certified by [[Underwriters Laboratories]], the GAO found that 43% were nonetheless fakes.&lt;ref name=nextgov/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-walmart-newegg-third-party-sellers-sell-counterfeits-report-gao/ "Popular goods sold through Amazon, Walmart and others are counterfeits: Government report"], ''CBS News'', Feb. 26, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The approximate cost to the U.S. from counterfeit sales was estimated to be as high $600 billion as of 2016.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;&lt;ref name=ipcommission&gt;[http://www.ipcommission.org/report/IP_Commission_Report_Update_2017.pdf "IP Commission Report"], The National Bureau of Asian Research, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 report by the [[Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property]], stated that China and Hong Kong accounted for 87 percent of counterfeit goods seized entering the United States,&lt;ref name=ipcommission/&gt; and claimed that the Chinese government encourages intellectual property theft.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;&lt;ref name=GAO-report&gt;[https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/689713.pdf "Intellectual Property: Agencies Can Improve Efforts to Address Risks Posed by Changing Counterfeits Market"], ''U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), January 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Utah Governor [[John A. Huntsman|Jon Huntsman]], who had served as U.S. ambassador to China, stated, "The vast, illicit transfer of American innovation is one of the most significant economic issues impacting U.S. competitiveness that the nation has not fully addressed. It looks to be, must be, a top priority of the new administration."&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;  In March 2017 President Trump signed an executive order to, among other things, ensure the timely and efficient enforcement of laws protecting Intellectual Property Rights holders from imported counterfeit goods.&lt;ref name=Whitehouse/&gt;

An Outside magazine article reminds us of the psychology of sales, and the role of gullible consumers, perhaps blindly ignoring warning signs of a "killer deal", somehow justifying buying an item they know is a fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.outsideonline.com/2078171/end-gear-counterfeiting-we-have-stop-lying-ourselves|title=RFID Tags Won’t Stop Counterfeiting|last=Lindsey|first=Joe|date=2016-05-10|work=Outside Online|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While manufacturers and vendors may offer legitimate good deals (factory seconds, product clearance or end-of-season discounts), consumers simply should not expect to buy quality name-brand goods for pennies on the dollar.

== Types ==
===Online sales===
In a report by the U.S. [[GAO]] in 2018, approximately 79 percent of the American population had bought products online.&lt;ref name=GAO-report/&gt; They found numerous products which were sold online by Amazon, Walmart, eBay, Sears and Newegg were counterfeit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Shop/video/warning-counterfeit-products-sold-online-53409156 "New warning of counterfeit products sold online"], ''ABC News'', Feb. 28, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; For 2017 it was estimated that online sales of counterfeit products amounted to $1.7 trillion.&lt;ref name=247wallst&gt;[https://247wallst.com/technology-3/2017/12/18/one-third-of-online-shoppers-victims-of-counterfeit-sales/ "One-Third of Online Shoppers Victims of Counterfeit Sales"], ''24/7 Wall St.'', Dec. 18, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pew Research Center]] states that worldwide such e-commerce sales are expected to reach over $4 trillion by 2020. [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|CBP]] has reported that with e-commerce, consumers often import and export goods and services which allows for more cross-border transactions which gives counterfeiters direct access to consumers.&lt;ref name=GAO-report/&gt; 

Internet sales of counterfeit goods has been growing exponentially, according to the [[International Trademark Association]], which lists a number of reasons why:
{{quote|Criminals prefer to sell counterfeits on the Internet for many reasons. They can hide behind the anonymity of the Internet—with the Dark Web even their IP addresses can be hidden. The Internet gives them the reach to sell to consumers globally—outside of the national limits of law enforcement. This international reach forces brand owners to prosecute cases outside of their local jurisdictions. Counterfeiters can display genuine goods on their site and ship counterfeit goods to the consumer. This makes it difficult for brand owners to even determine if a site is selling counterfeits without making costly purchases from the site. Criminal networks are involved with counterfeiting—which leads to hundreds of sites selling the same products on various servers. Making it an arduous task for the brand owner to stop them without working with authorities to take down the counterfeit rings.&lt;ref name=INTA&gt;[https://www.inta.org/Advocacy/Documents/2018/Addressing_the_Sale_of_Counterfeits_on_the_Internet_021518.pdf "Addressing the Sale of Counterfeits on the Internet"], International Trademark Association, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Buyers often know they were victimized from online sales, as over a third (34%) said they were victimized two or three times, and 11% said they had bought fake goods three to five times.&lt;ref name=247wallst/&gt; While many online sellers such as Amazon are not legally responsible for selling counterfeit goods, when items are brought to their attention by a buyer, they will apply a takedown procedure and quickly remove the product listing from their website.&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/04/amazon-may-have-a-counterfeit-problem/558482/ "Amazon May Have a Counterfeit Problem"], ''The Atlantic'', April 20, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/08/amazons-chinese-counterfeit-problem-is-getting-worse.html "Amazon's Chinese counterfeit problem is getting worse"], ''CNBC'', July 8, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In buying counterfeit goods directly from other smaller sellers, location is becoming less a factor, since consumers can purchase products from all over the world and have them delivered straight to their doors by regular carriers, such as USPS, FedEx and UPS. Whereas in previous years international counterfeiters had to transport most counterfeits through large cargo shipments, criminals now can use small parcel mail to avoid most inspections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobalipcenter.com/what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-about-counterfeit-goods-and-small-parcels/ "What We Know – and What We Don’t – About Counterfeit Goods and Small Parcels"], ''The Global IP Center'', March 7, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Rayban, Rolex, and Louis Vuitton are the most copied brands worldwide, with Nike being the most counterfeited brand globally according to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organization for Economic Co-operation and Developmen]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t (OECD). Counterfeit clothes, shoes, jewelry and handbags from designer brands are made in varying quality; sometimes the intent is only to fool the gullible buyer who only looks at the label and does not know what the real thing looks like, while others put some serious effort into mimicking fashion details.

Others realize that most consumers do not care if the goods they buy are counterfeit and just wish to purchase inexpensive products. The popularity of [[designer jeans]] in 1978, spurred a flood of knockoffs. Factories that manufacture counterfeit designer brand garments and watches are usually located in developing countries, with between 85-95% of all counterfeit goods coming from China.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; International tourists visiting [[Beijing]], China, may find a wide selection of counterfeit designer brand garments at the Silk Street. Expensive [[watch]]es are vulnerable to counterfeiting as well. 

In Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, authentic looking but poor quality watch fakes with self-winding mechanisms and fully working movements can sell for as little as USD $20 to good quality ones that sell for $100 and over. Also, some fakes' movements and materials are of remarkably passable quality &amp;ndash; albeit inconsistently so &amp;ndash; and may look good and work well for some years, a possible consequence of increasing competition within the counterfeiting community. 

Some counterfeiters have begun to manufacture their goods in the same factory as the authentic goods. &lt;u&gt;Yuandan goods&lt;/u&gt; is a term used to describe those fakes that are produced in the same factory as legitimate designer pieces without authorized permission to do so. These goods are made from scraps and leftover materials from the genuine products, produced illegally and sold on the black market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Thailand has opened a Museum of Counterfeit Goods displaying over 4,000 different items, in 14 different categories, which violate trademarks, patents, or copyrights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tilleke.com/firm/community/museum "Museum of Counterfeit Goods"], Tilleke &amp; Gibbins International, Thailand, accessed March 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest museum of this kind is located in Paris and is known as [[Musée de la Contrefaçon]].

In fashion, counterfeit goods are called knock offs. These counterfeit goods are usually sold on markets and street corners. Though purchasing goods might be seemingly harmless to those who are purchasing it knowingly, they are actually funding more dangerous organizations. The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau  in England, advices people not to buy counterfeit goods for three reasons,

* It funds drug dealing and or other types of organised crime

* contributes to job losses, as genuine manufacturers can not match the low prices of counterfeit goods. Though it may not seem like fashion houses are lacking in funds, but many houses fund their haute couture collections through selling their handbags are other accessories. Artisans and highly skilled workers that work at these ateliers are incredibly expensive and if customers choose to purchase knock offs instead of the real product, funds start to deplete and stores close down, and people are not hired, creating a high rate of unemployment in the economy.  

* genuine manufacturers are deprived of profits.

Another big problem in the counterfeit industry is that there are people who believe that they are buying the real deal, these people are the ones who need to be protected as they too have been frauded. They have paid for an item that they believe to be genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-36782724|title=What's wrong with buying fake goods?|last=Bell|first=Bethan|date=2016-07-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual property is a problem that seems to come up when talking about knock offs in fashion. There are alot of arguments that talk about how it is stealing the brands logo and prints. On the other side of this argument, many designers believe that counterfeiting is a form of flattery. Virgil Abloh of OFF WHITE famously said, “you can’t copy something that isn’t wanted”. Many fashion houses try and stop the knock offs from circulating, Louis Vuitton has an entire team that is just focused on stopping counterfeits. Gucci has adapted the counterfeit culture into its designs, changing the spelling of Gucci to Guccy for its spring summer 2018 collection and painting REAL all over the bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/2017/08/28/counterfeit-fashion-brands/|title=Is Counterfeiting Actually Good for Fashion? {{!}} Highsnobiety|date=2018-10-31|work=Highsnobiety|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a known fact that the even within the fashion industry there are counterfeits that happen. Intellectual property is a very funny thing in the fashion industry and the rule of thumb is to change the product you are copying 7 times for it to be considered different.

Counterfeit electronic components have proliferated in recent years, including [[integrated circuits]] (ICs), relays, circuit breakers, fuses, ground fault receptacles, and cable assemblies, as well as connectors. The value of counterfeit electronic components is estimated to total 2% of global sales or $460 billion in 2011.&lt;ref name=Hult/&gt; Counterfeit devices have been [[reverse-engineered]] (also called a Chinese Blueprint due to its prevalence in China) to produce a product that looks identical and performs like the original, and able to pass physical and electrical tests.&lt;ref name=Hult/&gt; 

Incidents involving counterfeit ICs has led to the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and [[NASA]] to create programs to identify bogus parts and prevent them from entering the supply chain.&lt;ref name=Hult/&gt; "A failed connector can shut down a satellite as quickly as a defective IC," states product director Robert Hult.&lt;ref name=Hult/&gt;

In some cases where the counterfeit media has packaging good enough to be mistaken for the genuine product, it is sometimes sold as such. Music enthusiasts may use the term "[[bootleg recording]]" to differentiate otherwise unavailable recordings from counterfeited copies of commercially released material.

In 2014, nearly 30% of the UK population was knowingly or unknowingly involved in some form of piracy, either through streaming content online or buying counterfeit DVDs, with such theft costing the UK audiovisual industries about £500m a year. Counterfeits are particularly harmful to smaller, independent film-makers, who may have spent years raising money for the film. As a result, the value of intellectual property becomes eroded and films are less likely to be made.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/17/digital-piracy-film-online-counterfeit-dvds "Movie piracy: threat to the future of films intensifies"], ''The Guardian'', July 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, U.S. agents seized more than 70,000 pirated copies of music and movies from a home in Fresno, California. Although it was a relatively small portion of all imported counterfeits, according to one expert:

{{quote|The United States government has made intellectual property protection a priority. It seems as if every week we see a new seizure of counterfeiting imports. These efforts are helpful and worthwhile, but U.S. officials and law enforcement can only do so much. Seizure of trademark and copyright infringing imports will hardly make a dent in the global piracy of intellectual property rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chester-law.com/1-million-worth-counterfeit-movies-music-seized/ "Nearly $1 Million Worth of Counterfeit Movies and Music Seized"], Chester Law, March 20, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;}}

China has been targeted by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) for distributing pirated movies and television shows. A selection of websites, internet newsgroups, peer-to-peer online networks and physical locations renowned for sharing illegal content, were presented to officials. Other countries were also listed as sources, including Russia, Brazil, Canada, Thailand and Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1342859/china-still-notorious-market-movie-and-tv-show-piracy-report-says "China is still a notorious market for movie and TV show piracy, report says"], ''South China Morning Post'', Oct. 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, it was reported that at least 22 fake [[Apple, Inc.|Apple Computer]] stores were operating in parts of China, despite others having been shut down in the past by authorities at other locations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-20091248-501465.html?tag=mncol;lst;10 "22 more fake Apple stores found in Kunming, China, says report"], CBS News, August 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, also in China, it was discovered that people were attempting to re-create the popular mobile game [[Angry Birds]] into a theme park without permission from its Finnish copyright or trademark owners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/09/16/scitech/main20107294.shtml "China steals "Angry Birds" for theme park"], CBS News, September 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===3D printed products===
Counterfeiting of countless items with either large or relatively cheap 3D printers, is a growing problem. The sophisticated printing material and the ever-expanding supply of digital CAD designs available online, will contribute to a black market in counterfeit goods. The [[Gartner Group]] estimated that intellectual property loss due to 3D printer counterfeiting could total $100 billion by 2018.&lt;ref name=Wired-3D&gt;[https://www.wired.com/insights/2015/02/illegal-immoral-and-here-to-stay-counterfeiting-and-the-3d-printing-revolution/ "Illegal, Immoral, and Here to Stay Counterfeiting and the 3D Printing Revolution"], ''Wired'', Feb. 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Among the technological fields that can be victimized by counterfeits will be auto and aircraft parts, toys, medical devices, drugs and even human organs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/Magazine/Issue/65/Country-correspondents/Counterfeiting-3D-printing-and-the-third-Industrial-Revolution "Germany: Counterfeiting, 3D printing and the third Industrial Revolution"], World Trademark Review'', Jan. 1, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; According to one intellectual property law firm:

{{quote|The democratization of manufacturing made possible by 3D printing has the potential to lead to counterfeiting on steroids. And, as 3D printers get better and better, faster and faster, and more and more consumer friendly, anyone can become a counterfeiter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.finnegan.com/en/insights/how-to-tell-what-s-real-and-what-s-fake-in-a-3d-printed-world.html "How to Tell What’s Real and What’s Fake in a 3D Printed World"], ''3D Printing Industry'', Feb. 5, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Along with making illicit parts for almost any major product, the fashion industry has become a major target of counterfeiters using 3D printing. The [[OHIM]] in 2017 found that approximately 10% of fashion products sold worldwide are counterfeits, amounting to approximately $28.5 billion of lost revenues per year in Europe alone. Industry leaders feared that budding counterfeiters would soon be creating bags, apparel and jewelry at a lower production cost after gaining access to pirated blueprints or digital files from manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/the-new-world-of-3d-printing-and-counterfeiting "The New World of 3D Printing … and Counterfeiting"], ''The Fashion Law'', March 28, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toys===
Counterfeit toys leave children exposed to potentially toxic chemicals and the risk of choking. An estimated 10 to 12 per cent of toys sold in the UK in 2017 were counterfeit, with the influx of counterfeit goods coming primarily from China. Trading Standards, a UK safety organization, seizes tens of thousands of toys every month to prevent children coming into contact with them, according to the British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA).&lt;ref&gt;[https://inews.co.uk/news/deluge-counterfeit-toys-leaving-children-exposed-toxic-chemicals-safety-experts-warn/ "A deluge of counterfeit toys is leaving children exposed to toxic chemicals, safety experts warn"], ''I News'', Jan. 23, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5410288/toys-warning-death-cancer-children-risk/ "Fake toys that can cause cancer and KILL are flooding into Britain"], ''The Sun'' (UK), Jan. 25, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian toy manufacturer [[Moose Toys]] have experienced problems with counterfeiting of their popular [[Shopkins]] toys in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/police-raid-chinese-toy-factory-moose-enterprise-and-local-police-seize-over-150000-counterfeit-shopkins-toys-in-china-300121778.html] PR Newswire, “Police Raid Chinese Toy Factory: Moose Enterprise and Local Police Seize Over 150,000 Counterfeit Shopkins Toys in China”, July 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fake+shopkins+guide] YouTube search for “fake shopkins guide”&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, five New York-based companies were accused of importing hazardous and counterfeit toys from China. Merchandise seized included knockoff toys featuring popular children's characters such as Winnie the Pooh, Dora the Explorer, SpongeBob SquarePants, Betty Boop, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, Spiderman, Tweety, Mickey Mouse and Pokemon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnn.com/2013/02/06/us/hazardous-toys/index.html "5 accused of importing counterfeit, hazardous toys"], ''CNN'', Feb. 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] seized $121,442 worth of counterfeit children’s toys that arrived into port from China and was destined for a North Carolina based importer.The shipment was found to contain multiple items bearing trademarks and copyrights registered to The [[Cartoon Network]], [[Apple Inc]]., [[Saban Brands]], and [[Danjaq]], LLC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/charleston-cbp-seizes-counterfeit-toys "Charleston CBP Seizes Counterfeit Toys"], U.S. Customs and Border Protection, July 26, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmaceuticals===
{{Main|Counterfeit medications}}
[[File:Counterfeit drugs.jpg|thumb|Counterfeit [[Viagra]]]]
According to the U.S. [[FBI]], the counterfeiting of pharmaceuticals accounts for an estimated $600 billion in global trade, and may be the "crime of the 21st century." They add that it "poses significant adverse health and economic consequences for individuals and corporations alike." The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates that over 30% of pharmaceuticals in developing countries are fake, stating that "Anyone, anywhere in the world, can come across medicines seemingly packaged in the right way but which do not contain the correct ingredients and, in the worst-case scenario, may be filled with highly toxic substances.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://publichealth.msu.edu/pph/pdf/certificates/counterfeit.pdf "Counterfeit Pharmaceuticals and Public Health"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708071510/http://publichealth.msu.edu/pph/pdf/certificates/counterfeit.pdf |date=July 8, 2013 }}, Michigan State Univ., Public Health dept]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/fake-pharmaceuticals-nigeria-s-drug-czarina-risks-death-to-take-on-counterfeiters-a-532066.html|title= Counterfeit drugs consist of pills, drops and ointments containing either incorrect active ingredients or none at all. Sometimes the active ingredients are so diluted that the drugs are completely ineffective.|work= [[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=2008-01-30|date= 2008-01-30|last1= Shafy|first1= Samiha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About one-third of the world's countries lack effective drug regulatory agencies, which makes them easy prey for counterfeiters. Globally, more than half of counterfeit pharmaceuticals sold are for life-threatening conditions, such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and cancer.&lt;ref name=Strategy/&gt; An estimated one million people die each year from taking toxic counterfeit medication.&lt;ref name=Strategy/&gt;

With the increase of internet sales, such fake drugs easily cross international boundaries and can be sold directly to unsuspecting buyers. In September 2017, Interpol, after a 10-year investigation, took down 3,584 websites in various countries, removed 3,000 online ads promoting illicit pharmaceuticals, and arrested 400 people.&lt;ref name=Interpol-2/&gt; 

The majority of online pharmacies taken down did not require a prescription to order the medicines and most sold potentially dangerous bogus versions of real drugs. One target for the operation was the illicit trade in opioid painkillers, especially [[fentanyl]], which is 50 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Counterfeit versions of other narcotics like [[OxyContin]] and [[Percocet]] also contain fentanyl as a key ingredient. Online pharmacies had flooded the US market and contributed to the [[opioid epidemic]],&lt;ref name=Interpol-2&gt;[https://www.securingindustry.com/pharmaceuticals/latest-interpol-led-pangea-op-nets-rogue-pharmacies/s40/a5754/#.W0vsFNVKjct "Latest Interpol-led Pangea op nets rogue pharmacies"], ''Securing Industry'', Sept. 26, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) claiming that sixty-six percent (66%) of the 63,600 overdose deaths in 2016 were caused by opioids, including fentanyl. The [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) found that "customers can purchase fentanyl products from Chinese laboratories online with powdered fentanyl and pill presses" which are then shipped directly to buyers via regular mail services such as USPS, DHL, FedEx, and UPS.&lt;ref name=HSGAC&gt;[https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Combatting%20the%20Opioid%20Crisis%20-%20Exploiting%20Vulnerabilities%20in%20International%20Mail1.pdf "Combatting the Opioid Crisis: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in International Mail"], Report of the Committee on Homeland Security, Jan. 24, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Buyers are attracted to rogue online pharmacies since they pose as legitimate businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=4105729 | pmid=25126373 | volume=7 | issue=4 | title=The health and economic effects of counterfeit drugs | year=2014 | journal=Am Health Drug Benefits | pages=216–24 | last1 = Blackstone | first1 = EA | last2 = Fuhr | first2 = JP Jr | last3 = Pociask | first3 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers are motivated by lower prices, and some are attracted by the ability to obtain prescription drugs without a prescription. Of the drugs bought online, however, 90 percent are found to come from a country different from one the website claims.&lt;ref name=Strategy/&gt; A 2018 report by the [[DHS]]

The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) describes counterfeit drugs as those sold under a product name without proper authorization:
:"Counterfeiting can apply to both brand name and generic products, where the identity of the source is mislabeled in a way that suggests that it is the authentic approved product. Counterfeit products may include products without the active ingredient, with an insufficient or excessive quantity of the active ingredient, with the wrong active ingredient, or with fake packaging."&lt;ref name=FDA&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm169898.htm "Counterfeit Drugs Questions and Answers"] FDA&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Economist]]'', between 15%-30% of [[antibiotic]] drugs in Africa and South-East Asia are fake, while the UN estimated in 2013 that roughly half of the [[antimalarial drugs]] sold in Africa—worth some $438m a year—are counterfeit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/may-2013/counterfeit-drugs-raise-africa%E2%80%99s-temperature "Counterfeit drugs raise Africa’s temperature"], ''AfricaRenewal'', U.N., May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2018 29 tons in counterfeit medicine were seized by [[Interpol]] in [[Niger]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/apxinterpol-raids-in-36-countries-yield-25m-in-fake-goods/ "Interpol: Raids in 36 countries yield $25M in fake goods"], ''Seattle Times'', July 12, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pfizer Pharmaceuticals]] has found fake versions of at least 20 of its products, such as [[Viagra]] and [[Lipitor]], in the legitimate supply chains of at least 44 countries. Pfizer also found that nearly 20% of Europeans had obtained medicines through illicit channels, amounting to $12.8 billion in sales. Other experts estimate the global market for fake medications could be worth between $75 billion and $200 billion a year, as of 2010.&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/16943895?story_id=16943895 "Poison pills"] ''Economist'' magazine, September 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prescription drugs that have been counterfeited are [[Plavix]], used to treat blood clots, [[Zyprexa]] for schizophrenia, [[Casodex]], used to treat prostate cancer, [[Tamiflu]], used to treat influenza, including [[2009 flu pandemic|Swine flu]], and [[Aricept]], used to treat [[Alzheimers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ice.gov/news/releases/0901/090115houston.htm "News Releases"] U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, January 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The EU reported that as of 2005 [[India]] was by far the biggest supplier of fake drugs, accounting for 75 percent of the global cases of counterfeit medicine. However, many drugs and other consumer products that were supposedly made in India, were actually made in China and imported into India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Customs-seize-Chinese-cargo-with-fake-made-in-India-products/articleshow/4787032.cms "Customs seize Chinese cargo with fake 'made-in-India' products"], ''The Times of India'', July 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Another 7% came from [[Egypt]] and 6% from [[China]]. Those involved in their production and distribution include "medical professionals" such as corrupt pharmacists and physicians, organized crime syndicates, rogue pharmaceutical companies, corrupt local and national officials, and terrorist organizations.&lt;ref name=OECD/&gt;

===Food===
Food fraud, "the intentional adulteration of food with cheaper ingredients for economic gain," is a well-documented crime that has existed in the U.S. and Europe for many decades. It has only received more attention in recent years as the fear of [[bioterrorism]] has increased. Numerous cases of intentional food fraud have been discovered over the last few years. As of 2013, the foods most commonly listed as adulterated or mislabelled in the [[United States Pharmacopeia]] Convention's Food Fraud Database were: milk, olive oil, honey, saffron, fish, coffee, orange juice, apple juice, black pepper, and tea.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cambriasoupcompany.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Food-Fraud-large.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
* In 2008, U.S. consumers were "panicked" and a "media firestorm" ensued when Chinese milk was discovered to have been [[2008 Chinese milk scandal|adulterated]] with the chemical [[melamine]], to make milk appear to have a higher protein content in government tests. It caused 900 infants to be hospitalized with six deaths.&lt;ref name=Newsweek/&gt;
* In 2007, the [[University of North Carolina]] found that 77 percent of fish labeled as [[red snapper (fish)|red snapper]] was actually [[tilapia]], a common and less flavorful species. The ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' tested fish at 17 sushi restaurants found that fish being sold as red snapper actually was mostly tilapia. Other inspections uncovered [[catfish]] being sold as [[grouper]], which normally sells for nearly twice as much as catfish.&lt;ref name=Newsweek/&gt; Fish is the most frequently faked food Americans buy, which includes "...selling a cheaper fish, such as pen-raised Atlantic salmon, as wild Alaska salmon." In one test, [[Consumer Reports]] found that less than half of supposedly "wild-caught" [[salmon]] sold in 2005-2006 were actually wild, and the rest were [[Aquaculture of salmon|farmed]].&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt;
* French [[Cognac (brandy)|cognac]] was discovered to have been adulterated with brandy, and their honey was mixed with cheaper sugars, such as [[high-fructose corn syrup]].&lt;ref name=Newsweek/&gt;
* In 2008, U.S. food safety officers seized more than 10,000 cases of counterfeit [[extra virgin olive oil]], worth more than $700,000, from warehouses in New York and New Jersey.&lt;ref name=Newsweek&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/02/07/the-fake-food-detectives.print.html|date=February 8, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021151003/http://www.newsweek.com/2010/02/07/the-fake-food-detectives.print.html|archivedate=October 21, 2010|title=The fake-food detectives|work=Newsweek|author=Jeneen Interlandi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olive oil is considered one of the most frequently counterfeited food products, according to the FDA, with one study finding that a lot of products labeled as "extra-virgin olive oil" actually contained up to 90% soybean oil.&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009-01-19-fake-foods_N.htm "Something fishy? Counterfeit foods enter the U.S. market"] ''USA Today'', January 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* From 2010 until 2012 the conservation group [[Oceana (a non-profit group)|Oceana]] analyzed 1,200 seafood samples from 674 retail outlets in 21 U.S. states. A third of the samples contained the DNA of a different type of fish to the one stated on the product label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.oceana.org/reports/oceana-study-reveals-seafood-fraud-nationwide|title=Oceana study reveals seafood fraud nationwide|date=February 2013|accessdate=2 May 2016|publisher=Oceana}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that fish with high levels of mercury such as [[tilefish]] and [[king mackerel]] were being passed off as relatively safe fish like [[grouper]]. [[Lutjanidae|Snapper]] (87%) and tuna (59%) were the most commonly mislabeled species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oceana.org/sites/default/files/National_Seafood_Fraud_Testing_Results_Highlights_FINAL.pdf|title=Oceana study reveals seafood fraud nationwide|date=February 2013|accessdate=2 May 2016|publisher=Oceana}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Genetic testing by the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' in 2011 found widespread mislabelling of fish served in area restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.boston.com/business/specials/fish_testing/ | title=Globe investigation finds widespread seafood mislabeling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Drug Administration]], the primary regulatory body for food safety and enforcement in the United States, admits that the "sheer magnitude of the potential crime" makes prevention difficult, along with the fact that food safety is not treated as a high priority. They note that with more than 300 ports of entry through which 13 percent of America's food supply passes, the FDA is only able to inspect about 2 percent of that food.&lt;ref name=Newsweek/&gt;

New U.S. seafood tracing regulations were announced by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/03/15/seafood/18hH7kvYZP1dHrmEdCZRGL/story.html|title=US aims to curb seafood fraud|author=David Abel|work=Boston Globe|date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Europe====
Food counterfeiting is a serious threat in Europe, especially for countries with a high number of trademark products such as Italy. In 2005, EU customs seized more than 75 million counterfeited goods, including foods, medicines and other goods, partly due to Internet sales. More than 5 million counterfeit food-related items, including drinks and alcohol products, were seized. According to the EU's taxation and customs commissioner, "A secret wave of dangerous fakes is threatening the people in Europe."&lt;ref name=Meatprocess&gt;[http://www.meatprocess.com/Financial/Counterfeit-food-a-serious-threat-says-EC "Counterfeit food a 'serious threat' says EC"] MeatProcess.com, November 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wine===
In China, counterfeit high-end wines are a growing beverage industry segment, where fakes are sold to Chinese consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2012) [http://orgprints.org/27565/7/27565.pdf "China fakes Australian premium organic wine"], Organic News, 26 June.&lt;/ref&gt; Knock-off artists refill empty bottles from famous chateaux with inferior vintages. According to one source, "Upwardly mobile Chinese, eager to display their wealth and sophistication, have since developed a taste for imported wine along with other foreign luxuries." In China, wine consumption more than doubled since 2005, making China the seventh-largest market in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/14/business/la-fi-china-counterfeit-wine-20120115 "Pricey counterfeit labels proliferate as China wine market booms"] ''Los Angeles Times'', January 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

The methods used to dupe innocent consumers includes photocopying labels, creating different and phony chateaux names on the capsule and the label. Sometimes authentic bottles are used but another wine is added by using a [[syringe]].
The problem is so widespread in China, the U.S. and Europe, that auction house [[Christie's]] has begun smashing empty bottles with a hammer to prevent them from entering the black market. During one sale in 2008, a French vintner was "shocked to discover that '106 bottles out of 107' were fakes." According to one source, counterfeit French wines sold locally and abroad "could take on a much more serious amplitude in Asia because the market is developing at a dazzling speed." Vintners are either unable or hesitant to fight such counterfeiters: "There are no funds. Each lawsuit costs 500,000 euros," states one French vintner. In addition, some vintners, like product and food manufacturers, prefer to avoid any publicity regarding fakes to avoid injuring their brand names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luxuo.com/wines-spirits/counterfeit-luxury-wines.html "After luxury bags, counterfeit luxury wines"], ''Luxuo.com'', November 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[wine fraud|Counterfeit wine]] is also found in the West, although primarily a problem for collectors of rare wine. Famous examples of counterfeiting include the case of [[Hardy Rodenstock]], who was involved with the so-called "Jefferson bottles,"&lt;ref name="New Y p2"&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/09/03/070903fa_fact_keefe?currentPage=2 The New Yorker, September 3, 2007: The Jefferson Bottles], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rudy Kurniawan]], who was indicted in March 2012 for attempting to sell faked bottles of [[La Tâche AOC|La Tâche]] from [[Domaine de la Romanée-Conti]] and [[Clos St. Denis]] from [[Domaine Ponsot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USA v. Kurniawan|url=http://winediarist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/RK-Indictment2.pdf|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the victims of the fraud were high-end wine collectors, including [[Bill Koch (businessman)|Bill Koch]], who sued both Rodenstock and Kurniawan over fake wines sold both at [[auction]] and privately.

=== Cosmetics ===
U.S. Customs and Border Protection suggest that the cosmetic industry is losing about $75 million annually based on the amount of imitation products that are smuggled into the U.S. each year. In addition to the lost revenue, cosmetics brands are damaged when consumers experience unhealthy side effects, such as eye infections or allergic reactions, from counterfeit products.&lt;ref name=makeup/&gt;

Customs agents seized more than 2,000 shipments of counterfeit beauty products in 2016, and noted that fake personal care items were more common than knockoff handbags. One of the biggest threats to beauty consumers is the risk that they are buying counterfeit products on familiar 3rd party retail platforms like Amazon.&lt;ref name=makeup&gt;[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fake-makeup-health-hazard-us-customs-and-border-protection/ "Fake makeup can be an easy buy – and a health hazard"], ''CBS'', Dec. 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cigarettes===
[[Illicit cigarette trade|Illicit cigarettes]] are an example of the multi-pronged threat of counterfeiting, providing hundreds of millions of dollars per year to entities such as [[Hamas]], [[Hezbollah]], [[al-Qaida]], [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] and the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=print_display&amp;article_id=226&amp;issue_id=22004 | title = Illicit cigarette tracking and the financing of organized crime | publisher = Police Chief magazine | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Counterfeit cigarettes cost [[taxpayer]]s in every nation billions in lost revenues while foisting on an unsuspecting public a product found to contain toxic substances like [[faeces]], [[asbestos]] and dead [[flies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2200633/Human-excrement-asbestos-dead-flies-The-ingredients-fake-cigarettes-Britain.html | title = Human excrement, asbestos and dead flies: the ingredients found in fake cigarettes that cost the taxpayer billions | publisher = Mail Online | year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The harm arising from this amalgam of [[contamination|contaminants]] sits on top of any baseline hazard ascribed to commercial [[tobacco]] products. With the sales of illicit cigarettes in Turkey, for example, exceeding 16.2 billion cigarettes per year, Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan labeled counterfeit tobacco as "more dangerous than terrorism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/economics/smoke-and-mirrors-in-turkey-with-illicit-cigarette-trade |title=Smoke and mirrors in Turkey with illicit cigarette trade |accessdate=2014-07-21 |publisher=Thenational.ae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military items===
According to a U.S. Senate committee report in 2012 and reported by ABC News, "counterfeit electronic parts from China are 'flooding' into critical U.S. military systems, including special operations helicopters and surveillance planes, and are putting the nation's troops at risk." The report notes that Chinese companies take discarded electronic parts from other nations, remove any identifying marks, wash and refurbish them, and then resell them as brand-new – "a practice that poses a significant risk to the performance of U.S. military systems.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/counterfeit-chinese-parts-slipping-us-military-aircraft-senate/story?id=16403599#.T7_YSbBQ6Ag "Counterfeit Chinese Parts Slipping Into U.S. Military Aircraft: Report"], ''ABC News'', May 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Senate&gt;[http://armed-services.senate.gov/press/SASC%20Counterfeit%20Electronics%20Report%2005-21-12.pdf "Senate Armed Services Committee Releases Report on Counterfeit Electronic Parts"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601035722/http://armed-services.senate.gov/press/SASC%20Counterfeit%20Electronics%20Report%2005-21-12.pdf |date=June 1, 2012 }}, U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Report, May 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==

===United States===
On November 29, 2010, the U.S. [[Department of Homeland Security]] seized and shut down 82 websites as part of a U.S. crackdown of websites that sell counterfeit goods, and was timed to coincide with "[[Cyber Monday]]," the start of the holiday online shopping season.&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;[https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/11/us-website-takedowns/ "U.S. Shutters 82 Sites in Crackdown on Downloads, Counterfeit Goods"] ''Wired'' magazine, November 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] announced that "by seizing these domain names, we have disrupted the sale of thousands of counterfeit items, while also cutting off funds to those willing to exploit the ingenuity of others for their own personal gain.”&lt;ref name=DOJ&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/November/10-ag-1355.html "Federal Courts Order Seizure of 82 Website Domains"] U.S. Dept. of Justice Press Release, November 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Members of Congress proposed a [[PROTECT IP Act]] to block access to foreign Web sites offering counterfeit goods.

Some U.S. politicians are proposing to fine those who buy counterfeit goods, such as those sold in New York's Canal Street market. In Europe, France has already created stiff sentences for sellers or buyers, with punishments up to 3 years in prison and a $300,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adnas.com/company-blog/french-warning-counterfeits-dont-sell-em-dont-buy-em "French warning on counterfeits: don't sell 'em, don't buy 'em"], Applied DNA Sciences, May 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Europe, non-profit organizations such as the [[European Anti-Counterfeiting Network]], fight the global trade in counterfeit goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.react.org/ |title=European Anti-Counterfeiting Network |publisher=REACT |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a counterfeit bust in New York in 2007, federal police seized $200 million in fake designer clothing, shoes, and accessories from one of the largest-ever counterfeit smuggling rings. Labels seized included [[Chanel]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Burberry]], [[Polo]], [[Ralph Lauren]] and [[Baby Phat]]. Counterfeit goods are a "...major plague for fashion and luxury brands," and numerous companies have made legal efforts to block the sale of counterfeits from China. Many of the goods are sold to retail outlets in [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://secondcitystyle.typepad.com/second_city_style/2007/12/counterfeit-lux.html "Counterfeit Luxury: Feds Bust Largest-Ever Counterfeit Smuggling Ring."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505011033/http://secondcitystyle.typepad.com/second_city_style/2007/12/counterfeit-lux.html |date=May 5, 2011 }} Second City Style, December 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

For trademark owners wishing to identify and prevent the importation of counterfeit goods, the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] agency supports a supplemental registration of trademarks through their Intellectual Property Rights e-Recordation program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apps.cbp.gov/e-recordations/docs/trademark_Application.pdf | title= U.S. Customs and Border Protection Intellectual Property Rights e-Recordation Application | publisher = U.S. Customs and Border Protection | year = 2006 | accessdate=11 February 2010  |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sheree Curry|title=Farewell, My Logo: A Detective Story - Counterfeiting Name Brands is Shaping Up as the Crime of the 21st Century.

====Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA)====
In October 2011, a bill was introduced entitled [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (SOPA). If the bill had been passed, it would have expanded the ability of U.S. [[law enforcement]] and copyright holders to fight online trafficking in copyrighted intellectual property and counterfeit goods. The bill would have allowed the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as copyright holders, to seek court orders against websites accused of enabling or facilitating copyright infringement. Opponents of the bill stated that it could have crippled the Internet through selective censorship and limiting free speech. In regards to the bill, the Obama administration stressed that "the important task of protecting intellectual property online must not threaten an open and innovative internet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/01/14/obama-administration-responds-we-people-petitions-sopa-and-online-piracy "Obama Administration Responds to We the People Petitions on SOPA and Online Piracy"], The White House Blog, January 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation was later withdrawn by its author, Rep. Lamar Smith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memeburn.com/2012/01/sopa-author-withdraws-controversial-anti-piracy-bill/ |title=SOPA author withdraws controversial anti-piracy bill |publisher=Memeburn.com |date=2012-01-23 |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
On October 1, 2011, the governments of eight nations including [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] signed the [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement]] (ACTA), which is designed to help protect intellectual property rights, especially costly copyright and trademark theft. The signing took place a year after diligent negotiations among 11 governments: Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland and the United States. The [[European Union|EU]], Mexico, Switzerland and China have not yet signed the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/10/01/uk-japan-trade-counterfeiting-idUKTRE79018620111001 "Anti-counterfeiting agreement signed in Tokyo"], ''Reuters'', October 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the latter, critics evaluated the agreement as insubstantial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1741186/acta-worthless-chinese-involvement "ACTA is worthless without Chinese involvement"], ''The Inquirer'', October 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/871/30976 "EU defends final Acta text on counterfeiting"], ''EUObserver.com'', October 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In China counterfeiting is so deeply rooted that crackdowns on shops selling counterfeit cause public protests during which the authorities are derided as "bourgeois puppets of foreigners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sharon |last=LaFraniere |authorlink=Sharon LaFraniere |title=Facing Counterfeiting Crackdown, Beijing Vendors Fight Back |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/world/asia/02piracy.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=1 March 2009 |accessdate=2 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Countries like [[Nigeria]] fight brand trademark infringement on a national level but the penalties are dwarfed by the earnings outlook for counterfeiters: "As grievous as this crime is, which is even worse than armed robbery, the penalty is like a slap on the palm, the most ridiculous of which is a fine of 50,000 naira ($307). Any offender would gladly pay this fine and return to business the next day."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nigerianhealthjournal.com/?p=1111 "Counterfeit drugs making nonsense of medical practice in Nigeria"], ''Nigerian Health Journal'', July 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2018 [[Interpol]] confiscated tonnes of fake products worth $25 million and arrested hundreds of suspects and broke up organized crime networks in 36 different countries on four continents. They raided markets, chemists, retail outlets, warehouses and border control points, where they seized among other things, pharmaceuticals, food, vehicle parts, tobacco products, clothing, and agrochemicals. Over 7.2 million counterfeit and illicit items weighing more than 120 tonnes were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2018-07/13/content_56534071.htm "Interpol seizes 25 mln USD fake goods in worldwide operations"], ''China.org'', July 13, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights laws===
Counterfeit products are often produced in violation of basic human rights and [[child labor]] laws and human rights laws, as they are often created in illegal [[sweatshops]].&lt;ref name=cnbc&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/38229835 "Counterfeiting: Many Risks and Many Victims"], ''CNBC'', July 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Clothing manufacturers often rely on sweatshops using children in what some consider "slave labor" conditions. According to one organization, there are some 3,000 such sweatshops in and around [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsnews.net/2015/05/garment-sweatshops-in-argentina-an-open-secret/ "Garment Sweatshops in Argentina an Open Secret"], Inter Press Service, May 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Dana Thomas]] described the conditions she witnessed in other country's sweatshops, noting that children workers are often smuggled into countries and sold into labor:

{{quote|I remember walking into an assembly plant in Thailand a couple of years ago and seeing six or seven little children, all under 10 years old, sitting on the floor assembling counterfeit leather handbags. The owners had broken the children's legs and tied the lower leg to the thigh so the bones wouldn't mend. [They] did it because the children said they wanted to go outside and play. . . I went on a raid in a sweatshop in Brooklyn, and illegal workers were hiding in a rat hole, [and] impossible to know how old the workers were.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Dana. ''Deluxe: How Luxury Lost Its Luster'', Penguin (2007) p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;}}

U.S. Supreme Court justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]], who has tried to prosecute counterfeiters, notes that major industries have suffered the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs due to the exploitation of child labor in sweatshops in New York and Asia. Those often produce dangerous merchandise, such as fake auto parts or toys, made of toxic and easily breakable materials.&lt;ref name=Felix&gt;Felix, Antonia. ''Sonia Sotomayor: The True American Dream'', Penguin (2010) e-book&lt;/ref&gt;

The profits often support [[terrorist groups]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/12/business/worldbusiness/12iht-fake.4569452.html | work=The New York Times | title=Counterfeit goods are linked to terror groups - Business - International Herald Tribune | date=February 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[drug cartels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Borunda |first=Daniel |url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_20429526/mexican-drug-cartels-tap-counterfeit-market |title=Mexican drug cartels tap counterfeit market |publisher=El Paso Times |date=2012-04-19 |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[people smuggler]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tulli.fi/en/finnish_customs/publications/annual_reports/intelligence_report_2008.pdf |title= According to the Spanish authorities, cases involving counterfeit products are often linked to the organisation of illegal immigration.|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[organized crime|street gangs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&amp;id=7489118 |title=Counterfeit goods fund violent gang activity &amp;#124; abc7.com |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI has found evidence that a portion of the financing of the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] came from a store selling counterfeit T-shirts.&lt;ref name=Felix/&gt; The same has been found surrounding many other organized crime activities. According to Bruce Foucart, director of US Homeland Security’s National Intellectual Property Coordination Centre, the sales of counterfeit goods funded the Charlie Hebdo attack of 2016 in Paris, which left 12 people dead and nearly a dozen more injured.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.esquire.com/style/news/a51777/counterfeit-designer-fashion-complex-documentary/|title=Counterfeit Fashion Is Funding Terrorism, Sweatshops, and Untold Human Misery|date=2016-12-21|work=Esquire|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of pirated CDs have been linked to funding the 2004 Madrid train bombing, and investigations firm Carratu connects money from counterfeit goods to Hezbollah, Al Qaeda, the Japanese Yakuza, the ETA, and the Russian Mob.

The crackdown on counterfeit goods has not only become a matter of human rights but one of national and international security in various countries. The FBI has called product counterfeiting "the crime of the 21st century."&lt;ref name="MSU"&gt;[http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2010/msu-launches-first-anti-counterfeiting-research-program/ "MSU LAUNCHES FIRST ANTI-COUNTERFEITING RESEARCH PROGRAM"], ''MSU Today'', Michigan State University, February 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet shopping sites===
Major Internet shopping sites, such as Amazon.com, ebay.com, and Alibaba.com, provide complaint pages where listings of counterfeit goods can be reported. The reporter must show that it owns the intellectual property (e.g. trademark, patent, copyright) being presented on the counterfeit listings. The shopping site will then do an internal investigation and if it agrees, it will take the counterfeit listing down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2013/09/25/the-power-of-policing-trademarks-and-design-patents/id=45369/ |title=Nowotarski, Mark, "The Power of Policing Trademarks and Design Patents", IPWatchdog, 25 September 2013 |publisher=Ipwatchdog.com |date= 2013-09-25|accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris |first=Dan |url=http://www.chinalawblog.com/2013/04/stopping_china_counterfeiting.html |title=Harris, Dan, "How to Stop China Counterfeiting, Or At Least Reduce It", ChinaLawBlog, 21 April 2013 |publisher=Chinalawblog.com |date=2013-04-21 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social media platforms ===
Besides, online market sites, the shift to digital for luxury and consumer goods have led to both promising opportunities and serious risks. The British government, released a study, ''Social Media and Luxury Goods Counterfeit'', stating 1/5 of all items tagged with luxury good brand names on Instagram are fakes, with 20% of the posts featured counterfeit goods from accounts, usually based in China, Russia, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Ukraine. ''It also highlights the scale, impact, and characteristics of infringement, and that sophistication from counterfeiters continues to grow through social media platforms.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Share and share alike: the challenges from social media for intellectual property rights|last=|first=|publisher=UK Government: Intellectual Property Office|year=2017|isbn=978-1-910790-30-4|location=|pages=1–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, in a span of 3-day period, Instagram has identified 20,892 fake accounts selling counterfeit goods, collectively responsible for 14.5 million posts, 146,958 new images and gaining 687,817 new followers, with Chanel (13.90%), Prada (9.69%) and Louis Vuitton (8.51%) being the top affected brands, according to ''Social Media and Luxury Goods Counterfeit: a growing concern for government, industry and consumers worldwide'' study from The Washington Post.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social media and luxury goods counterfeit: a growing concern for government, industry and consumers  worldwide|last=Stroppa|first=Andrea|publisher=The Washington Post|year=2016|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=1–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media and mobile applications have turned into ideal platforms for transactions and trades. Counterfeit users and sellers would set up online accounts on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook and post counterfeit or illicit products through ways of sponsored ads and deals. The consumer can easily contact buyers and purchase the counterfeit goods unknowingly, by email, WhatsApp, WeChat, and PayPal. As social media watchdogs and groups are working on cracking and shutting down accounts selling counterfeit goods, counterfeiters continue to operate 24 hours, with advanced systems in algorithms, artificial intelligence, and spambots, also tactics involving automatic account creation, avoid in detection and tax-and-duty-free law. It is advised by many that brands, tech platforms, governments and consumers require a comprehensive strategy and cross-sector collaboration to combat the multifaceted system enabling the international counterfeit market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/consumers/2016/05/27/luxury-goods-instagram-fake-counterfeit/85018328/|title=That Chanel bag on your Instagram feed may be fake|work=azcentral|access-date=2017-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So far, only United Kingdom, Scotland and Erie representatives have taken the initiatives by using law enforcement and criminal charges to fight against counterfeiting and piracy on social media accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/Intelligence/Online-Brand-Enforcement/2017/Chapters/New-trends-in-online-counterfeiting-require-updated-enforcement-policies/|title=New trends in online counterfeiting require updated enforcement policies - World Trademark Review|website=www.worldtrademarkreview.com|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concern still needs tremendous effort in updating its enforcement policies in online counterfeiting, below are some emerging solutions suggested by World Trademark Review:
* Social media surveillance – New technical filters and deploy further resources; engaging in open information sharing; and promoting broader awareness in public campaigns
* Continued enforcement measures – Rogue website actions; customs training and cooperation with law enforcement; and addressing counterfeit goods at the source
* Reinforce in postal service – advance data screening for mail parcels and shipments
* Adopting a set of best practices in payment processors
* Collaborate with third-party cooperation for reliance

==Anti-counterfeiting packaging==
[[Packaging]] can be engineered to help reduce the risks of [[package pilferage]] or the theft and resale of products: Some package constructions are more resistant to pilferage and some have pilfer indicating seals. Counterfeit consumer goods, unauthorized sales (diversion), material substitution and tampering can all be reduced with these anti-counterfeiting technologies. Packages may include [[authentication]] seals and use [[security printing]] to help indicate that the package and contents are not [[counterfeit]]; these too are subject to counterfeiting. Packages also can include anti-theft devices, such as dye-packs, [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] tags, or [[electronic article surveillance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/anti-shoplifting-device.htm How Anti-shoplifting Devices Work”], HowStuffWorks.com&lt;/ref&gt; tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and require specialized tools to deactivate. Anti-counterfeiting technologies that can be used with packaging include:
*2D barcodes - data codes that can be tracked
*Color shifting ink or film - visible marks that switch colors or texture when tilted
*[[Applied DNA Sciences|DNA tracking]] - genes embedded onto labels that can be traced
*Encrypted micro-particles - unpredictably placed markings (numbers, layers, and colors) not visible to the human eye
*Forensic markers
*[[Hologram]]s - graphics printed on seals, patches, foils or labels and used at point of sale for visual verification
*[[Kinetic diffraction grating]] images
*Micro-printing - second line authentication often used on currencies
*[[Near-field communication|NFC (Near Field Communication)]] tagging for authentication - short-range wireless connectivity that stores information between devices
*Overt and covert feature
*[[QR code]]
*Security pigments and inks - marks only visible under ultraviolet light and is not under normal lighting conditions
*Serialized [[barcode]]s
*Tactile prints - dots printed directly onto surface of the product, provide embossed finishes to highlight specific design features
*[[Tamper evident]] seals and tapes - destructible or graphically verifiable at point of sale
*[[Taggant]] fingerprinting - uniquely coded microscopic materials that are verified from a database
*[[Track and trace]] systems - use codes to link products to database tracking system
*Water indicators - become visible when contacted with water
With the increasing sophistication of counterfeiters techniques, there is an increasing need for designers and technologists to develop even more creative solutions to distinguish genuine products from frauds, incorporating unique and less obvious aspects of identification into the design of goods. One of the most impressive of techniques exploits anisotropic optical characteristics of conjugated polymers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Müller, Christian, Garriga, M. &amp; Campoy-Quiles, M.|year=2012|title=Patterned optical anisotropy in woven conjugated polymer systems|url=|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=101|issue=17|page=171907|via=|doi=10.1063/1.4764518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineers have developed specialized markings and patterns that can be incorporated within the designs of textiles that can only be detected under polarized lights. Similar to methods implemented in the production of currency, invisible threads and dyes are used to create unique designs within the weaves of luxury textiles that cannot be replicated by counterfeiters due to a unique set of fibres, anisotropic tapes, and polymer dyes used by the brand and manufacturer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Annual European Student Competition "Exploring the Ancient Greek Language and Culture"''' is an international [[competition]] held in [[Europe]] and in [[Mexico]]. It takes place yearly, and is to be considered among the most important high-school student competitions in classical languages held in Europe. &lt;br&gt;

== Organisation ==
This competition is organised by the ''Greek Ministry of National Education and [[Religion|Religious]] Affairs'', and more specifically the ''Directorate of International Relations in Education'' and the Pedagogical Institute. Co-organisors are the ''Hellenic Language Heritage'', the ''Society of Greek Philologists'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eephil.gr Society of Greek Philologists]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[European Cultural Centre of Delphi]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eccd.gr European Cultural Centre of Delphi]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Organization for the Internationalization of the [[Greek Language]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odeg.gr Organization for the Internalization of the Greek Language]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Pan-Hellenic Association of Teachers for the Greek Language and Civilization''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.p-e-f.gr Panhellenic Associations of Teachers for the Greek Language]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims of the competition ==
The aim of the annual competition is the promotion of [[classical studies]] among those students of high schools throughout Europe where the [[Ancient Greek Language]] is taught. Furthermore, the organisors' intention is to emphasize the importance of classical studies throughout the acquisition  and the study of the Ancient Greek world, to highlight the “European dimension” of ancient times, to emphasize the ties between the everlasting ideas and values of classical antiquity with the fundamental values of European history and civilization, to promote the Ancient Greek language as a means of expressing humanitarian ideas and values, in an era, when classical studies in Europe are declining, and last but not least to strengthen the classical studies in European schools by exchanging experiences between students and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ypepth.gr/en_ec_category6437.htm Greek Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs]&lt;/ref&gt;
The participants of the competition are students of the third grade of Greek Lyceums in all European countries, except Greece and Cyprus, and students of the last grade of High schools in all European countries, equivalent to the last (3rd) grade of Greek High schools, except Greece and Cyprus, as well as those of Mexico.&lt;br&gt;

== Prizes ==
The prizes are the following:
* 3. Certificate of Distinction        
* 2. Honorary Mention.
* 1. The best student from each participating country is invited to a journey through Greece lasting a whole week, which is organized by the ''Hellenic Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs''.

'''''Girl with Balloon''''' (also, '''''Balloon Girl''''' or '''''Girl and Balloon''''') is a 2002-started London series of [[Stencil graffiti|stencil murals]] by the graffiti artist [[Banksy]], depicting a young girl with her hand extended toward a red heart-shaped [[Toy balloon|balloon]] carried away by the wind. The first work was on [[Waterloo Bridge]], and other murals were around London, though none remain there. Banksy has several times used variants of this design to support social campaigns: in 2005 about the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|West Bank barrier]], in 2014 about the [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugee crisis]], and also about the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 UK election]]. A 2017 [[Samsung]] poll ranked ''Girl with Balloon'' as the United Kingdom's number one favourite artwork.

In 2018, a framed copy of the work spontaneously shredded during an auction, by way of a mechanical device Banksy had hidden in the frame. Banksy authenticated he was responsible for the shredding and gave the altered piece a new name, ''[[Love Is in the Bin]]''. Sotheby said it was "the first work in history ever created during a live auction."

==History==
[[File:BANKSY LONDON.jpg|thumb|right|This variation in London, seen above in 2006, was the last one in the city, painted over in 2007.]]
The first mural was in 2002 at the stairs for [[Waterloo Bridge]] on the [[South Bank]] side. A number of other mural versions were also created in London, though, mostly painted over, none of the works by Banksy are remaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hxb9BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT24|title=Banksy Locations &amp; Tours Volume 1: A Collection of Graffiti Locations and Photographs in London, England|last=Bull|first=Martin|date=2011-11-01|publisher=PM Press|isbn=9781604863208|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 version of the mural was at an east London shop in [[Shoreditch]], sold in 2007 for £37,200 at [[Sotheby's]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6340109.stm|title=Record price for Banksy bomb art|date=8 February 2007|accessdate=17 December 2015|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was removed by the Sincura Group in 2014 and sold for £500,000 in September 19 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-26022513 |title=London Banksy Girl and Balloon mural to be removed |last=McDermott |first=Josephine |date=7 February 2014 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several sets of [[Edition (printmaking)|limited edition prints]] of the work were produced, which became valuable over time. An initial set of 25 signed prints was produced in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/london/2018-03-08/banksy-girl-and-balloon-canvas-smashes-auction-estimate/|title=Banksy 'Girl and Balloon' canvas smashes auction estimate|work=ITV News|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/24744/lot/44/|title=Bonhams : Banksy (British, born 1975) Girl and Balloon 2003|website=www.bonhams.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a set of 150 signed prints and a set of 600 unsigned prints were produced in 2004/2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.picturesonwalls.com/|title=picturesonwalls|website=www.picturesonwalls.com|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.myartbroker.com/artist/banksy/girl-with-balloon/|title=Banksy Girl With Balloon (2004), Meaning &amp; Description, My Art Broker|work=My Art Broker|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, one of the signed set of 150 was auctioned for £56,250, more than twice its estimated value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/westcountry/2015-11-25/banksy-print-makes-more-than-a-picasso-at-auction/|title=Banksy print makes more than a Picasso at auction|work=ITV News|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 version was sprayed directly onto the cardboard backing of an [[IKEA|Ikea]] frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-17559526|title=Banksy artworks sell for £400,000|date=2012-03-30|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/20195/lot/237/|title=Bonhams : Banksy (b. 1975) Girl and Balloon 2009  signed and inscribed For Mike.

In August 2005, Banksy included it as part of a series of murals on the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|West Bank barrier]], a variation called ''Balloon Debate'' of the girl [[Cluster ballooning|floating above]] the wall while holding onto a bunch of balloons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20171215-how-a-balloon-can-be-an-emblem-of-hope|title=How a balloon can be an emblem of hope|last=Grovier|first=Kelly|date=2017-12-15|website=BBC|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/column/the-art-of-protest/article/2014/3/26/the-art-of-protest-banksy/|title=Banksy and the Wall|last=Kim|first=Adela H.|date=2014-03-26|website=The Harvard Crimson|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/opinion/banksy-sothebys-art-shredded-1368280|title=Can We Just Admit That Banksy's Art-Shredding Stunt Is Actually Really Good?|last=Davis|first=Ben|date=2018-10-10|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the third anniversary of the Syria conflict, Banksy reworked the painting to depict a Syrian refugee and added the [[hashtag]] #WithSyria. On 13 March, the image was projected on the [[Eiffel Tower]] and [[Nelson's Column]]. An animated video was released, featuring animation based on Banksy's work, narration by [[Idris Elba]], and music by [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/banksy-reworks-girl-with-heart-balloon-to-mark-third-anniversary-of-syria-conflict-9187047.html |title=Banksy reworks girl with heart balloon to mark third anniversary of Syria conflict |author=Jess Denham |date=12 March 2014 |work=The Independent |accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following weeks, the singer [[Justin Bieber]] got a tattoo based on the original art and posted a picture of it on Instagram before deleting it. Banksy posted this picture on his Facebook page with the comment "Controversial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/03/18/justin-bieber-banksy-tattoo-graffiti-artist_n_4984389.html |title=Justin Bieber's Banksy Tattoo Blasted By The Graffiti Artist, Sort Of |date=18 March 2014 |work=The Huffington Post UK |accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, a [[Samsung]] poll of 2,000 people from the United Kingdom asked participants to rank twenty pieces of British art. The poll's results listed ''Balloon Girl'' as the people's number one favourite artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-40717821 |title=Banksy's balloon girl chosen as nation's favourite artwork |date=26 July 2017 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===United Kingdom general election controversy===
In early June 2017 before the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|United Kingdom general election]], Banksy introduced a variant of ''Girl with Balloon'' with the balloon coloured with the [[Union Jack]] design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itv.com/news/2017-06-03/banksy-offers-free-art-print-to-those-who-vote-against-the-conservatives/ |title=Banksy risks breaking election law with offer of art prints for anti-Conservative voters |publisher=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] |date=3 June 2017 |accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banksy initially offered to send a free print of his art to registered voters in certain constituencies who could offer photographic proof they had voted against the [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]]. The offer included a disclaimer: "This print is a souvenir piece of campaign material, it is in no way meant to influence the choices of the electorate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Connor |first=Roisin |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/general-election-2017-banksy-free-print-vote-against-conservative-party-theresa-may-eu-brexit-a7772341.html |title=Banksy is offering free art to people who vote against the Tories |date=4 June 2017 |work=Independent |accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banksy cancelled this offer on 6 June 2017 after the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] warned him it could violate election [[bribery]] laws and invalidate the election's results in those constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Morris |first=Steven |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jun/06/bansky-free-election-artwork-bristol-withdrawn |title=Banksy forced to withdraw offer to send free artwork to non-Tory voters |date=6 June 2017 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shredding at auction===
{{Main|Love Is in the Bin}}
On 5 October 2018, a 2006 framed copy of the artwork was auctioned at Sotheby's selling for £1,042,000 – a record high for the artist.&lt;ref name=martinez/&gt; Moments after the closing bid, the artwork began to self-destruct by means of a hidden mechanical paper shredder that Banksy had built into the frame bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-45770028 |title=Banksy artwork shreds itself after £1m sale at Sotheby's |date=6 October 2018 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the lower half shredded. Banksy released an image of the shredding on Instagram with the words "Going, going gone..".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/06/banksy-sothebys-auction-prank-leaves-art-world-in-shreds-girl-with-balloon |title=Banksy auction prank leaves art world in shreds |first=Chris |last=Johnston|date= 6 October 2018 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sotheby's said "We have not experienced this situation in the past where a painting spontaneously shredded",&lt;ref name=martinez&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/apos-appears-just-got-banksy-144105925.html |title='It Appears We Just Got Banksy-ed.'

The woman who won the bidding at the auction decided to go through with the purchase. The partially shredded work has been given a new title, ''Love Is in the Bin'', and was authenticated by Banksy's authentication body Pest Control. Sotheby's released a statement that called it "the first artwork in history to have been created live during an auction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/11/woman-who-bought-shredded-banksy-artwork-will-go-through-with-sale |title=Woman who bought shredded Banksy artwork will go through with purchase |first=Mattha|last= Busby|date=11 October 2018|work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.artnet.com/market/banksy-re-authenticates-shredded-1-4-million-european-buyer-will-keep-1369852 |title=Banksy Authenticates and Renames His Shredded $1.4 Million Painting—Which the Buyer Plans to Keep|first=Eileen|last= Kinsella|date=11 October 2018 |work=artnet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Global Peace and Unity''' event/festival (often abbreviated as '''GPU''') is a recurring two-day conference held at the [[ExCeL London|ExCeL Exhibition Centre]] in [[Royal Victoria Dock]], [[London]], [[England]] and organized by the [[Islam Channel]]. It is the largest [[Muslim]], [[Interfaith dialog|interfaith]] and [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] event  of its kind in [[Europe]], having attracted over 55,000 visitors from five continents during the 2006 event.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Safdar|first=Anealla| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/dec/04/mondaymediasection1|title=The untold good news story about Muslims|work=Dispatches|location= |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=4 December 2006|accessdate=28 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been six conferences since its inception in the inaugural event held on 4 December 2005, with others in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2013. The conference includes an Islamic exhibition, an evening [[Anasheed|nasheed]] concert, as well as a series of talks, workshops, seminars and lectures from international speakers spanning the two days.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GPU07"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theglobalunity.com/|title=Global Peace &amp; Unity Event 2007 - 24th &amp; 25th November 2007|accessdate=27 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
According to the official website, the Global Peace and Unity event is designed to promote "global cohesion across all communities," as well as "break barriers and build bridges between the variety of cultures and groups that follow the Islamic faith."&lt;ref name="GPU07"/&gt; As well as giving Muslims the opportunity to enjoy themselves and provide a platform for them to learn more about their religion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Islam Channel]], The Global Peace &amp; Unity Event 2005 Special Collector's Edition DVD&lt;/ref&gt; The event aspires to spread peace and foster unity between like-minded representatives of communities in the UK and worldwide. It aims to bring together people from all spheres of the British society in order to inform and educate them about Islam and Muslims, and through this help to bridge the gaps between Muslims and non-Muslims and improve community relations.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="objectives"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theglobalunity.com/10/info/media/origin-and-values-menu|title=Global Peace &amp; Unity Event - Origin and Values|accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Khurram Mujtaba, director of operations of Islam Channel, "the event is a means through which to promote dialogue."&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; According to [[Mohamed Ali Harrath]], chairman of the event and Islam Channel’s CEO, "the event offers a crucial platform for demanding change through peaceful interfaith dialogue, and positive exchange of ideas and interaction towards fostering mutual understanding between people from every culture, faith and background in a bid for greater community cohesion in a multicultural society."&lt;ref name="ethnicnow"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnicnow.com/channels/arts-culture/press-release/5/861/the-global-peace-and-unity-event.html|title=Ethnic Now - The Global Peace and Unity Event 2006|accessdate=22 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chairman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ali|first=Mohamed |url=http://www.theglobalunity.com/10/info/media/message-from-chairman-menu|title=Message From Global Peace and Unity Event Chairman Ali|work= |location= |publisher=[[Islam Channel]]|date=22 October 2010|accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The event consists of three main parts. One is an exhibition which houses numerous stalls, selling Islamic gifts and serving cuisines emanating from a variety of cultures. Other stalls promote Islamic business, while yet others are reserved for the collection of [[Charity (practice)|charity]] donations for organizations like [[Muslim Aid]] and [[Islamic Relief]]. The other two parts of the event are composed of an evening concert on the first day and series of talks and lectures by international speakers on the second. Throughout both days artists provide entertainment on-stage in the form of nasheed pieces or comedy sketches.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chairman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mayet|first=Fahad|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1165994313617&amp;pagename=Zone-English-Youth/YTELayout|title=Global Peace and Unity Event, London|work=|location=|publisher=[[IslamOnline]]|date=21 December 2006|accessdate=27 October 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316193805/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1165994313617&amp;pagename=Zone-English-Youth%2FYTELayout|archivedate=16 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6227">'''Harry Samit''' is a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] [[Special Agent]] based at the [[List of FBI Field Offices|FBI Field Office]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. He is a former [[United States Navy]] [[Office of Naval Intelligence|Naval Intelligence]] Officer who participated in an aviation indoctrination course (he does not hold Naval Aviator wings).  Samit's aeronautical ratings consist of an Air Transport Canada (Canadian) certified [[private pilot|private pilot license.]]  Samit is most noted for arresting [[Zacarias Moussaoui]] on August 16, 2001.

Samit became aware of Moussaoui because of Clancy Prevost,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rakemag.com/2005/04/grounded-man/2/ The Grounded Man] ''Rake Magazine'' May 2005, retrieved Feb 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; a [[certified flight instructor]] at the Pan-Am International Flight Academy in [[Eagan, Minnesota]]. Moussaoui had enrolled for training in a [[747-400]] [[flight simulator]] at the school on August 13 but his behavior during instruction alarmed Prevost, who did not believe that Moussaoui was just a wealthy individual interested in flying [[Wide-body aircraft|jumbo jets]]. At Prevost's urging, the flight school contacted the Minneapolis FBI Field Office, and Samit was one of the special agents assigned to investigate Moussaoui.

Moussaoui was arrested by INS Special Agents for a [[Visa (document)|visa]] violation on August 16 but, because the arrest was effected outside the Residence Inn where Moussaoui had been staying, Samit had no legal right to search the hotel room and its contents without Moussaoui's consent. Moussaoui denied consent, so Samit could only search Moussaoui and his car. Samit found a small knife in Moussaoui's left pocket and another knife in the car.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ktwbtv.trb.com/la-na-moussa10mar10,0,7797069.story?coll=ktwb-home-5] ''KTWB-TV'', retrieved March 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a certified private pilot himself, Samit was suspicious, suspecting that Moussaoui was plotting an act of international [[terrorism]] against the [[United States]]. He therefore sought permission to search Moussaoui's belongings which were known to include several bags and suitcases, and a [[laptop computer]]. The first application to obtain a criminal [[search warrant]] was denied by FBI Headquarters on the ground of insufficient evidence. A second application to search was made under the ''[[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]]'' of 1978, but this was also denied. The FBI did obtain a search warrant for the belongings, but only after the [[September 11th attacks]]. The Minneapolis Field Office had received a report from Moussaoui's home government of [[France]] that linked him to [[Islamic terrorism]], but the FBI Headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] did not believe that evidence was sufficient to present to the FISA court for a search warrant.  On the question of using foreign government intelligence to validate a request for a domestic search warrant through the FISA court, it is unclear if the Field Office could have appealed administratively to the White House National Security Council.  Had the belongings been opened before September 11, knives, flight manuals, and other clues would have been found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-moussa21mar21,1,5398407.story?coll=la-headlines-frontpage Agent Faults FBI on 9/11] ''The Los Angeles Times'' March 21, 2006, retrieved March 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether these clues would have sparked a national emergency or simply been treated like the August 6 memo entitled ''[[Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US]]'' is subject to debate.

When FBI Headquarters denied both Samit's application for search powers, he initiated a process to notify the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) of his suspicions of possible [[aircraft hijacking]] attempts, but FBI Headquarters censored the memo. Relying on personal contacts, Samit then met with a Minneapolis FAA official, but that official did not pursue Samit's leads.

"I am so desperate to get into his computer, I'll take anything,"&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10373766"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=2&amp;ObjectID=10373766 |title=September 11 alert was ignored, says FBI agent |date=March 22, 2006 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samit wrote in an e-mail on September 10, 2001.

In March 2006, during Moussaoui's death sentence trial, Samit testified that he had spent the time between August 16 and September 11 trying to warn U.S. officials about the possibility of terrorist actions involving the hijacking of aircraft. Four such actions occurred in the United States on September 11, 2001. Samit testified under oath that "[[criminal negligence]], [[obstruction of justice|obstruction]] and careerism" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/content/news/crime/story/14232880p-15054935c.html Moussaoui alerts ignored, agent says]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''The Sacramento Bee'' March 21, 2006, retrieved March 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; by superiors at FBI Headquarters in [[Washington, DC]] thwarted an opportunity to prevent the [[September 11th attacks]].

The '''Hillsborough disaster''' was a fatal [[human crush]] during an [[1988–89 FA Cup|FA Cup]] semi-final match between [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] at [[Hillsborough Stadium]] in [[Sheffield]], England, on 15 April 1989. With 96 fatalities and 766 injuries, it was the worst disaster in British sporting history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/15/newsid_2491000/2491195.stm|title=1989: Football fans crushed at Hillsborough|date=15 April 1989|publisher=BBC|access-date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crush occurred in the two standing-only central pens in the Leppings Lane stand, allocated to Liverpool supporters. Shortly before kick-off, in an attempt to ease overcrowding outside the entrance [[turnstile]]s, the police match commander, [[chief superintendent]] David Duckenfield, ordered exit gate C to be opened, leading to an influx of even more supporters to the already overcrowded central pens.&lt;ref name="Myths dispelled"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-35473732|title=Five Hillsborough myths dispelled by inquests jury|first=Richard |last=Turner |publisher=BBC News|access-date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days and weeks following the disaster, police fed false stories to the press suggesting that hooliganism and drinking by Liverpool supporters were the root causes of the disaster. Blaming of Liverpool fans persisted even after the [[Taylor Report]] of 1990, which found that the main cause of the disaster was a failure of control by [[South Yorkshire Police]] (SYP).&lt;ref name="Tragedy to truth"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/timelines/zpdc7hv|title=Hillsborough Disaster: From tragedy to truth|publisher=BBC News|access-date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Taylor report, the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]] (DPP) ruled there was no evidence to justify prosecution of any individuals or institutions.&lt;ref name="Tragedy to truth" /&gt; The disaster also led to a number of safety improvements in the largest English football grounds, notably the elimination of fenced [[Terrace (stadium)|standing terraces]] in favour of [[all-seater stadium]]s in the top two tiers of English football.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/04/26/the-legacy-of-hillsborough---how-football-has-changed/|title=The legacy of Hillsborough – how football has changed|website=The Telegraph|access-date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/13/liverpool-hillsborough-disaster-anniversary|title=Out of the ashes of Hillsborough, modern football was born, writes Owen Gibson|last=Gibson|first=Owen|date=12 April 2009|website=The Guardian|access-date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first coroner's inquests into the Hillsborough disaster, completed in 1991, ruled all deaths that occurred that day to be [[Accidental death|accidental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/dec/19/hillsborough-high-court-quashes-inquest-verdicts|title=High court quashes Hillsborough inquest verdicts|last=Gibson|first=Owen|date=19 December 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Families strongly rejected the original coroner's findings,&lt;ref name="Tragedy to truth" /&gt; and their fight to have the matter re-opened persisted, despite [[Murray Stuart-Smith|Lord Justice Stuart-Smith]] concluding in 1997 there was no justification for a new inquiry.&lt;ref name="Tragedy to truth" /&gt; [[Private prosecution]]s brought by the Hillsborough Families Support Group against Duckenfield and his deputy Bernard Murray failed in 2000.&lt;ref name="Tragedy to truth" /&gt;

==Before the disaster==
[[File:The Leppings Lane Stand at Hillsborough in 1991 - geograph.org.uk - 2807209.jpg|right|thumb|The West Stand of Sheffield Wednesday's [[Hillsborough Stadium]], where the disaster unfolded, seen two years later in 1991.]]

===Venue===
Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, the home of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], was selected by [[the Football Association]] (FA) as a neutral venue to host the FA Cup semi-final between [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] football clubs. Kick-off was scheduled for 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm on 15 April, and fans were advised to take up positions 15 minutes beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-35473732|title=Five Hillsborough Myths Dispelled by Inquests Jury |publisher=BBC News |date=28 April 2016 |accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the disaster, most English football stadiums had high steel fencing between the spectators and the playing field in response to both friendly and hostile [[pitch invasion]]s. [[Football hooliganism|Hooliganism]] had affected the sport for some years, and was particularly virulent in England.&lt;ref name="Before Hillsborough"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Before Hillsborough fans were seen as terrace fodder.

A report by Eastwood &amp; Partners for a safety certificate for the stadium in 1978 concluded that although it failed to meet the recommendations of the ''[[Green Guide]]'', a guide to safety at sports grounds, the consequences were minor. It emphasised the general situation at Hillsborough was satisfactory compared with most grounds.&lt;ref name="hip_report"/&gt;{{rp|67}}

Risks associated with confining fans in pens were highlighted by the ''Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds'' (the [[Oliver Popplewell|Popplewell]] inquiry) after the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] in May 1985. It made recommendations on the safety of crowds penned within fences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Daniel|title=How Bradford fire neglect left Hillsborough doomed to disaster|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/sep/15/hillsborough-bradford-daniel-taylor|work=The Guardian Sports Blog |accessdate=15 September 2012|date=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including that "all exit gates should be manned at all times ... and capable of being opened immediately from the inside by anyone in an emergency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cmd 9710: Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds Final Report|year=1986|publisher=The Stationery Office, London|page=62|url=http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/HWP000000170001.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Previous incidents====
Hillsborough hosted five FA Cup semi-finals in the 1980s. A crush occurred at the Leppings Lane end of the ground during the 1981 semi-final between [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] after hundreds more spectators were permitted to enter the terrace than could safely be accommodated, resulting in 38 injuries, including broken arms, legs and ribs.&lt;ref name="taylor 21"&gt;Taylor (1989), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Police believed there had been a real chance of fatalities had swift action not been taken, and recommended the club reduce its capacity. In a post-match briefing to discuss the incident, Sheffield Wednesday chairman [[Bert McGee]] remarked: "Bollocks—no one would have been killed".&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Witness. [http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/docs/SWF000001370001.pdf Assistant Chief Constable Robert Goslin] 14 August 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Conn|first= David|url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/19/hillsborough-families-sheffield-wednesday-manslaughter-charge |title=Safety failings that contributed to death of 96 Liverpool fans were foreseeable|newspaper=The Guardian|date= 19 September 2012|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident nonetheless prompted Sheffield Wednesday to alter the layout at the Leppings Lane end, dividing the terrace into three separate pens to restrict sideways movement.&lt;ref name="hip_report" /&gt; This 1981 change and other later changes to the stadium invalidated the stadium's safety certificate. The safety certificate was never renewed and the stated capacity of the stadium was never changed.&lt;ref name="hip_report" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/local/sheffield-licensing-officer-from-time-of-hillsborough-disaster-still-works-for-council-1-4929787|title=Sheffield licensing officer from time of Hillsborough disaster still works for council|work=Sheffield Star|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terrace was divided into five pens when the club was promoted to the First Division in 1984, and a [[crush barrier]] near the access tunnel was removed in 1986 to improve the flow of fans entering and exiting the central enclosure.

After the crush in 1981, Hillsborough was not chosen to host an FA Cup semi-final for six years until 1987.&lt;ref name="hip_report" /&gt; Serious overcrowding was observed at the 1987 quarter-final between Sheffield Wednesday and [[Coventry City]]&lt;ref name="cov_obs1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Carpente|first= Steve|url=http://www.coventryobserver.co.uk/2012/09/20/news-Sky-Blues-fans-recall-Hillsborough-choas-50631.html|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BPbJQpWX?url=http://www.coventryobserver.co.uk/2012/09/20/news-Sky-Blues-fans-recall-Hillsborough-choas-50631.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 October 2012|title=Sky Blues fans recall Hillsborough choas|newspaper=Coventry Observer|date=19 September 2012|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again during the semi-final between Coventry City and [[Leeds United]] at Hillsborough.&lt;ref name="cov_obs2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bates|first= Matthew|url=http://www.coventryobserver.co.uk/2012/09/12/news-Hillsborough-warning-signs-were-there-in-1987---report-50174.html|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AhvAyZIM?url=http://www.coventryobserver.co.uk/2012/09/12/news-Hillsborough-warning-signs-were-there-in-1987---report-50174.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 September 2012|title=Hillsborough warning signs were there in 1987|newspaper=Coventry Observer|date= 12 September 2012|accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leeds were assigned the Leppings Lane end. A Leeds fan described disorganisation at the turnstiles and no steward or police direction inside the stadium, resulting in the crowd in one enclosure becoming so compressed he was at times unable to raise and clap his hands.&lt;ref name="cov_obs2" /&gt; Other accounts told of fans having to be pulled to safety from above.&lt;ref name="hip_report" /&gt;

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest met in the semi-final at Hillsborough in 1988, and fans reported crushing at the Leppings Lane end. Liverpool lodged a complaint before the match in 1989. One supporter wrote to the Football Association and [[Minister for Sport and the Olympics|Minister for Sport]] complaining, "The whole area was packed solid to the point where it was impossible to move and where I, and others around me, felt considerable concern for personal safety".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross |first=Sam |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/911825-david-bernstein-makes-unreserved-apology-for-hillsborough-disaster |title=David Bernstein makes unreserved apology for Hillsborough disaster |work=Metro |date=13 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AhxlVdrj?url=http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/911825-david-bernstein-makes-unreserved-apology-for-hillsborough-disaster |archivedate=16 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yorkshire police command changes ===
Police presence at the previous year's FA Cup semi-final (also between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest and also at Hillsborough Stadium) had been overseen by Chief Superintendent Brian L. Mole.&lt;ref name="Brian Mole"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/docs/SYP000067080001.pdf|title=Witness statement of Chief Superintendent Brian Mole, South Yorkshire Police|last=Hillsborough Independent Panel|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mole had supervised numerous police deployments at the stadium in the past. In October 1988 a probationary PC in Mole's F division, South Yorkshire was handcuffed, photographed, and stripped by fellow officers in a fake robbery, as a [[hazing]] prank. Four officers resigned and seven were disciplined over the incident. Chief Superintendent Mole himself was to be transferred to the Barnsley division for "career development reasons". The transfer was to be done with immediate effect on 27 March 1989.&lt;ref name="transfer"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/07/most-experienced-police-commander-prank-transfer-hillsborough-disaster|title=Hillsborough inquest hears of police commander's transfer before match|last=Conn|first=David|date=7 July 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Hillsborough was accepted as the FA Cup semi-final venue on 20 March 1989 by the Football Association.&lt;ref name="Brian Mole" /&gt; The first planning meeting for the semi-final took place on 22 March and was attended by newly promoted Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield, not by Mole. No known minutes exist of this meeting.&lt;ref name="transfer" /&gt; Although Mole could have been assigned the semi-final match's planning despite his transfer, that was not done. This left planning for the semi-final match to Duckenfield, who had never commanded a sell-out football match before, and who had "very little, if any" training or personal experience in how to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/30/hillsborough-police-officer-david-duckenfield-training-1989-fa-cup-barrister|title=Hillsborough police officer in command 'had little training' for 1989 FA Cup|last=Conn|first=David|date=30 June 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disaster==
[[File:Hillsborough west side 1989.png|thumb|360px|right|Leppings Lane was the sole access point for Liverpool supporters. The approach has been described as a "bottleneck" in which attendees had to fill two sides of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last= Conn| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-inquiry-anatomy-of-a-disaster-video|title= Hillsborough: anatomy of a disaster|newspaper= The Guardian|date= 26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Build-up===
As is common at domestic matches in England, opposing supporters were segregated. Nottingham Forest supporters were allocated the South Stands and [[Spion Kop (stadiums)|Spion Kop]]{{efn |Several British stadiums have a stand called "Spion Kop" or "The Kop". The name, originally that of a hill in South Africa, usually refers to an unusually steep stand.}} on the east end, with a combined capacity of 29,800, reached by 60 turnstiles spaced along two sides of the ground. Liverpool supporters were allocated the North and West ends (Leppings Lane), holding 24,256 fans, reached by 23 turnstiles from a narrow concourse. Turnstiles numbered 1 to 10, 10 in all, provided access to 9,700 seats in the North Stand; a further 6 turnstiles (numbered 11 to 16) provided access to 4,456 seats in the upper tier of the West Stand. Finally, 7 turnstiles (lettered A to G) provided access to 10,100 standing places in the lower tier of the West Stand. Although Liverpool had more supporters, Nottingham Forest was allocated the larger area, to avoid the approach routes of rival fans crossing. As a result of the stadium layout and segregation policy, turnstiles that would normally have been used to enter the North Stand from the east were off-limits and all Liverpool supporters had to converge on a single entrance at Leppings Lane. On match day, radio and television advised fans without tickets not to attend. Rather than establishing crowd safety as the priority, clubs, local authorities and the police viewed their roles and responsibilities through the 'lens of hooliganism'.&lt;ref&gt;Scraton, P., 2004. 4 Death on the Terraces: The Contexts and Injustices of the 1989 Hillsborough Disaster. Soccer &amp; Society, 5(2), pp.183–200.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Timeline ===
Three [[Football Specials|chartered trains]] transported Liverpool supporters to Sheffield for a match fixture{{efn |name=fixture}} in 1988, but only one such train ran in 1989. The 350 passengers arrived on the grounds about 2:20&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name="taylor 9"&gt;Taylor (1989), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Many supporters wished to enjoy the day and were in no hurry to enter the stadium too early. Some supporters were delayed by roadworks while crossing the [[Pennines]] on the [[M62 motorway]] which resulted in minor traffic congestion. Between 2:30&amp;nbsp;pm and 2:40&amp;nbsp;pm, there was a build-up of supporters outside the turnstiles facing Leppings Lane, eager to enter the stadium before the game began.&lt;ref name="taylor 34"/&gt; At 2:46&amp;nbsp;pm, the BBC's football commentator [[John Motson]] had already noticed the imbalance of distribution of people in the Leppings Lane pens. While rehearsing for the match off-air, he suggested a nearby cameraman look as well.&lt;ref name="Panorama"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaBnY-SnwxA|title=BBC Panorama 2013: Hillsborough Disaster. How They Buried the Truth.|publisher=YouTube|access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "There's gaps, you know, in parts of the ground. Well, if you look at the Liverpool end, to the right of the goal, there's hardly anybody ''on'' those steps...that's it. Look down there."&lt;ref name="Panorama" /&gt;

Outside the stadium, a bottleneck developed with more fans arriving than could be safely filtered through the turnstiles before 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm. People presenting tickets at the wrong turnstiles and those who had been refused entry could not leave because of the crowd behind them but remained as an obstruction. Fans outside could hear cheering as the teams came on the pitch ten minutes before the match started, and as the match kicked off, but could not gain entrance. A police constable radioed control requesting that the game be delayed, as it had been two years before, to ensure the safe passage of supporters into the ground. The request to delay the start of the match by 20 minutes&lt;ref name="heard the crowd"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bruce-grobbelaar-heard-crowd-hillsborough-3417682|title=Bruce Grobbelaar: I heard the crowd at Hillsborough cry 'Please help us..'|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|date=6 April 2009|access-date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was declined.&lt;ref name="taylor 11"&gt;Taylor (1989), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

With an estimated 5,000 fans trying to enter through the turnstiles and increasing safety concerns, the police, to avoid fatalities outside the ground, opened a large exit gate (Gate C) that ordinarily permitted the free flow of supporters departing the stadium. Two further gates (A and B) were subsequently opened to relieve pressure. After an initial rush, thousands of supporters entered the stadium "steadily at a fast walk".&lt;ref name="taylor 12"&gt;Taylor (1989), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Hillsborough disaster outside.jpg|right|thumb|The scene outside the ground as the disaster began]]

===Crush===
BBC television cameras were at the ground to record the game for ''[[Match of the Day]].'' As the disaster unfolded, the events were relayed live to the Saturday sports show, ''[[Grandstand (BBC)|Grandstand]]''. In Ireland, [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] also showed the disaster unfolding, as it was covering the match live through its programme ''[[Sports Stadium]]''.

When the gates were opened, thousands of fans entered a narrow tunnel leading to the rear of the terrace into two overcrowded central pens (pens 3 and 4), creating pressure at the front. Hundreds of people were pressed against one another and the fencing by the weight of the crowd behind them. People entering were unaware of the problems at the fence; police or stewards usually stood at the entrance to the tunnel and, when the central pens reached capacity, directed fans to the side pens, but on this occasion, for reasons not fully explained, they did not.&lt;ref name="BBC 14 April 2009"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7992845.stm |title= How the Hillsborough disaster happened |publisher=BBC News |date=14 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[BBC TV]] news report conjectured that if police had positioned two police horses correctly, they would have acted as [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] directing many fans into side pens, but on this occasion, it was not done.

The match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest began as scheduled at 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm. Fans were still streaming into pens 3 and 4 from the rear entrance tunnel as the match began. For some time, problems at the front of the Liverpool central goal pens went largely unnoticed except by those inside it, and by a few police at that end of the pitch. Liverpool's goalkeeper, [[Bruce Grobbelaar]], reported fans from behind him pleading to him for help as the situation worsened.&lt;ref name="heard the crowd" /&gt; The police at first attempted to stop fans from spilling out of the pens, some believing this to be a pitch invasion. At approximately 3:05&amp;nbsp;pm in match action, [[Peter Beardsley]] kicked a shot which struck Nottingham Forest's goal bar. Possibly connected to the excitement, a surge in pen 3 caused one of its metal crush barriers to give way,&lt;ref name="BBC 14 April 2009" /&gt; thrusting people forward on top of one another, and into the pen's front fences.

South Yorkshire Police Superintendent Greenwood (the ground commander) realised the situation, and ran on the field to gain referee [[Ray Lewis (referee)|Ray Lewis]]'s attention. Lewis stopped the match at 3:05:30&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2009/04/03/hillsborough_timeline_feature.shtml|title=Timeline to disaster|publisher=BBC|access-date=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as fans climbed the fence in an effort to escape the crush and went onto the track. By this time, a small gate in the fence had been forced open and some fans escaped via this route, as others continued to climb over the fencing. Other fans were pulled to safety by fans in the West Stand above the Leppings Lane terrace. The intensity of the crush broke more crush barriers on the terraces. Holes in the perimeter fencing were made by fans desperately attempting to rescue others.&lt;ref name="BBC 14 April 2009" /&gt;

The crowd in the Leppings Lane Stand overspilled onto the pitch, where the many injured and traumatised fans who had climbed to safety congregated.&lt;ref name="BBC 14 April 2009" /&gt; Football players from both teams were ushered to their respective dressing rooms, and told that there would be a 30-minute postponement.&lt;ref name="heard the crowd" /&gt; Those still trapped in the pens were packed so tightly that many victims died of [[compressive asphyxia]] while standing. Meanwhile, on the pitch, police, stewards and members of the [[St John Ambulance]] service were overwhelmed. Many uninjured fans assisted the injured; several attempted [[CPR]] and others tore down advertising [[billboard|hoardings]] to use as stretchers.&lt;ref name="BBC 14 April 2009"/&gt; Chief Superintendent John Nesbit of South Yorkshire Police later briefed [[Michael Shersby]] MP that leaving the rescue to the fans was a deliberate strategy, and is quoted as saying "We let the fans help so that they would not take out their frustration on the police" at a Police Federation conference.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, Page 360, Section 2.12.161&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hillsborough disaster.jpg|right|thumb|Liverpool fans desperately try to climb the fence onto the safety of the pitch while being stopped by the police.]]
As events unfolded, some police officers were still deployed making a cordon three-quarters of the way down the pitch to prevent Liverpool supporters reaching the opposing supporters. Without public address announcements to explain the situation, many Nottingham Forest fans on the other end were chanting for their team and whistled their anger at what they saw as a pitch invasion, incensing some of the Liverpool supporters. Some fans tried to break through the cordon simply to ferry injured fans to waiting ambulances on the Nottingham Forest end but were forcibly turned back.

====SYMAS response to the crush====
The agreed upon protocol for the [[South Yorkshire Ambulance Service|South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service]] (SYMAS) was that ambulances were to queue at the entrance to the gymnasium, termed the ''casualty reception point'', or CRP.&lt;ref name=HIP/&gt;{{rp|145}} Any individuals within the stadium in need of medical attention were to be delivered expeditiously by police and paramedics to the CRP.&lt;ref name=HIP&gt;{{Cite report

The system of ferrying injured ''from'' any location within the stadium ''to'' the CRP required a formal declaration to be made by those in charge for it to take effect.&lt;ref name=HIP/&gt;{{rp|137,138}} As this declaration was not immediately performed, confusion reigned over those attempting to administer aid on the pitch. This confusion migrated to the first responders waiting in ambulances at the CRP, a location which quickly deteriorated into an ambulance parking lot.&lt;ref name=HIP/&gt;{{rp|143}} Some crews were hesitant to leave their vehicles, unsure of whether patients were coming to them, or vice versa.&lt;ref name=HIP/&gt;{{rp|138–140}} Others who did leave their vehicles were then faced with the obstacles inherent in placing distance between oneself and one's equipment. As the Panel explained in their report: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The equipment was no use on the ambulance vehicle when critical early resuscitation was taking place some distance away on the pitch, behind the Leppings Lane end and in the gymnasium. Some ambulance crew did take equipment when they left their vehicle, but there was no systematic direction to do so, not all did, and none initially had been given any information about the situation inside the stadium."&lt;ref name=HIP/&gt;{{rp|146}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; A total of 42 ambulances arrived at the stadium.&lt;ref name=HIP/&gt;{{rp|149}} Out of this number, two managed of their own accord to make their way onto the pitch — while a third ambulance made its way onto the pitch at the direction of DCAO Hopkins, who felt its visibility might allay crowd concerns.&lt;ref name=HIP/&gt;{{rp|149}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ESPN Staff|title=Key Hillsborough Evidence Backed By TV Footage|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/208215.html|website=ESPN.co.uk|publisher=ESPN Sports Media Ltd.|accessdate=5 July 2017|date=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barlow|first1=Eleanor|title=Ambulanceman's Struggle to Live with Decisions Made on Pitch at Hillsborough|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/ambulance-officer-tells-hillsborough-inquests-8572035|accessdate=5 July 2017|work=liverpoolecho|publisher=Trinity Mirror Merseyside|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Hayden|title=Hillsborough: New Probe Backs Crucial Evidence|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/05/20/hillsborough-off-duty-pcs-crucial-evidence-finally-backed-after-analysis-of-footage-3801532/|accessdate=5 July 2017|work=Metro|publisher=Associated Newspapers Limited|date=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weston|first1=Alan|title=Ambulances Got 'Stuck' As They Tried to Enter Hillsborough Stadium, Inquests Hear|publisher=Trinity Mirror Merseyside|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/ambulances-stuck-tried-enter-hillsborough-8543150|accessdate=5 July 2017|work=liverpoolecho|date=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining 39 ambulances were collectively able to transport approximately 149 people to either [[Northern General Hospital]], [[Royal Hallamshire Hospital]], or [[Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust|Barnsley Hospital]] for treatment.&lt;ref name=HIP/&gt;{{rp|149}}

The adverse comments of two doctors regarding the emergency response appeared in the media.

===Reactions===
Condolences flooded in from across the world, led by [[Queen Elizabeth II|the Queen]]. Other messages came from [[Pope John Paul II]], US President [[George H. W. Bush]], and the chief executive of [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] (fans of Liverpool and Juventus were involved in the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]) amongst many others.&lt;ref name="Herald3"/&gt;

Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Home Secretary]] [[Douglas Hurd]] visited Hillsborough the day after the disaster and met survivors.&lt;ref name="Herald1"/&gt; [[Anfield Stadium]] was opened on the Sunday to allow fans to pay tribute to the dead.

At [[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral]], a requiem mass attended by 3,000 people was held by the Catholic [[Archbishop of Liverpool]], [[Derek Worlock]]. The first reading was read by Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar. Liverpool players [[Ronnie Whelan]], [[Steve Nicol]], and former manager [[Joe Fagan]] carried the [[Eucharist|communion]] bread and wine.&lt;ref name="Herald2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Thousands unite in grief at cathedral|page=1 | newspaper = Glasgow Herald |date=17 April 1989 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&amp;dat=19890417&amp;printsec=frontpage}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Sheppard]], the Anglican Bishop of Liverpool, on holiday on the Scottish island of [[Barra]] on the day of the disaster, was airlifted by RAF helicopter to attend.

The FA chief executive [[Graham Kelly (football)|Graham Kelly]], who had attended the match, said the FA would conduct an inquiry into what had happened. Speaking after the disaster, Kelly backed all-seater stadiums, saying "We must move fans away from the ritual of standing on terraces".&lt;ref name="Herald1"/&gt; Standing on terraces and the use of perimeter fencing around the pitch, the use of [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]], the timing of football matches and policing of sporting events were factors for a subsequent inquiry to consider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MPs urge Hurd to introduce safety gates into 'killer cages'|page=9 | newspaper = Glasgow Herald |date=17 April 1989|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&amp;dat=19890417&amp;printsec=frontpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UEFA]] President [[Jacques Georges]] caused controversy by describing the Liverpool supporters as "beasts",&lt;ref name="news.google"&gt;{{cite news|title=Head of UEFA must quit says club|page=7 | newspaper = Glasgow Herald |date=18 April 1989|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19890418&amp;id=gDNAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RFkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3690,378298%3D}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrongly suggesting that hooliganism was the cause of the disaster, which had occurred less than four years after the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. His remarks led to Liverpool F.C. calling for his resignation, but he apologised on discovering hooliganism was not the cause.&lt;ref name="news.google" /&gt;

At the [[1989 FA Cup Final]] between Liverpool and local rivals [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], held just five weeks after the Hillsborough disaster, the players from both participating teams wore [[Armband#Mourning|black armbands]] as a gesture of respect to the victims,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live4liverpool.com/2012/05/the-liverpool-way/liverpool-fcs-top-five-fa-cup-finals/|title=Liverpool FC's Top Five FA Cup Finals|publisher=live4liverpool.com|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a minute's silence also observed.

During the [[Liverpool F.C. 0–2 Arsenal F.C. (26 May 1989)|final match]] of the 1988–89 English Football League season, contested on 26 May 1989 between Liverpool and second-place [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], the Arsenal players presented flowers to fans in different parts of Anfield in memory of those who had died in the Hillsborough disaster.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/mar/29/arsenal-liverpool-1989-football | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jason | last=Cowley | title=The night football was reborn | date=29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1717/editorial/2009/05/26/1285463/its-up-for-grabs-now-the-20th-anniversary-of-anfield-1989|title=Feature: It's Up For Grabs Now – The 20th Anniversary Of Anfield 1989|publisher=Goal.com|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disaster appeal fund===
A disaster appeal fund was set up with donations of £500,000 from the Government, £100,000 from Liverpool F.C. and £25,000 each from the cities of Liverpool, Sheffield and Nottingham.&lt;ref name="Herald1"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Police to face inquiry as questions go unanaswered|page=1 | newspaper = Glasgow Herald|location=Glasgow|date=19 April 1989|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&amp;dat=19890417&amp;printsec=frontpage|postscript="."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool donated the share of the money they would have received for the game.&lt;ref name="Herald3"/&gt; Within days donations had passed £1&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name="Herald4"/&gt; swelled by donations from individuals, schools and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/LCA000000010001.html|title=A random sample of letters from public, schools and clubs reflecting the nature of donations to the disaster appeal fund|publisher=Hillsborough Independent Panel|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fund raising activities included a [[Factory Records]] benefit concert and several fundraising football matches. [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], the teams involved in the Bradford City stadium fire, met for the first time since the 1985 disaster in a game which raised £25,000. When the appeal closed the following year, it had raised over £12&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Charity fund-raising and the public interest: an Anglo-American legal perspective|year=1990|publisher=Avebury|page=127|isbn=9781856280167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the money went to victims and relatives of those involved in the disaster and provided funds for a college course to improve the hospital phase of emergency care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcseng.ac.uk/media/medianews/CollegecoursedevelopedfromHillsboroughDisasterAppealFund|title=College course developed with funds from the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Fund goes from strength to strength|publisher=RCS|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1989, a charity version of the [[Gerry and the Pacemakers]] song "[[Ferry Cross the Mersey]]" was released in aid of those affected. The song featured Liverpool musicians [[Paul McCartney]], [[Gerry Marsden]] (of the Pacemakers), [[Holly Johnson]], and [[The Christians (band)|the Christians]], and was produced by [[Stock Aitken Waterman]]. It entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number 1 on 20 May, remaining at the top for a total of three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/search-results-album/_/Ferry+Cross+The+Mersey#single|title=The Official Charts Company – Ferry Cross The Mersey by Gerry Marsden, Paul McCartney, Holly Johnson, The Christians and Stock Aitken Waterman Search |date=6 May 2013|publisher=The Official Charts Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Gerry and the Pacemakers' earlier hit "[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]" had stronger ties to Liverpool FC, it was not used because it had recently been rerecorded for the Bradford City stadium fire appeal.&lt;ref name="Davis2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Sharon|title=80s Chart-Toppers: Every Chart-Topper Tells a Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v_IyT35pJCgC&amp;pg=PT501|date=6 January 2012|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|isbn=9781780574110|page=501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MurphyRees-Jones2007"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Murphy|editor-first1=Michael|editor-last2=Rees-Jones|editor-first2=Deryn|last=du Noyer|first=Paul |title=Writing Liverpool: Essays and Interviews|year=2007|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=9781846310744|chapter=Subversive Dreamers: Liverpool Songwriting from the Beatles to the Zutons Paul du Noyer|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on survivors===
By the disaster's 10th anniversary in 1999, at least three people who survived were known to have committed suicide. Another survivor had spent eight years in psychiatric care. There were cases of alcoholism, drug abuse, and collapsed marriages involving people who had witnessed the events. The lingering effects of the disaster were seen as a cause, or contributary factor, in all of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/may/08/weekend7.weekend |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=Those who were left behind |date=8 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==
A total of 96 people died as a result of injuries incurred during the disaster. 94, aged from 10 to 67 years old, died on the day, either at the stadium, in the ambulances, or shortly after arrival at hospital.&lt;ref name="liverpooldailypost.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/hillsborough/hillsborough-96/ |title=Hillsborough 96 |publisher=Liverpooldailypost.co.uk |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=7 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927005155/http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/hillsborough/hillsborough-96/|archive-date=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 766 people were reported to have suffered injuries, although less than half required hospital treatment.

This followed a legal challenge in the [[High Court]] by his family to have his treatment withdrawn, a landmark challenge which succeeded in November 1992.

Andrew Devine, aged 22 at the time of the disaster, suffered similar injuries to Tony Bland and was also diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state. In March 1997—just before the eighth anniversary of the disaster—it was reported he had emerged from the condition and was able to communicate using a touch-sensitive pad, and he had been showing signs of awareness of his surroundings for up to three years before. He is still alive {{as of|2015|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/hillsborough-survivor-awakes-1275031.html |title=Hillsborough survivor 'awakes' |work=The Independent |location=London |date=26 March 1997 |accessdate=7 May 2011 |first=Matthew |last=Brace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two sisters, three pairs of brothers, and a father and son were among those who died,&lt;ref name="liverpooldailypost.co.uk"/&gt; as were two men about to become fathers for the first time: 25-year-old Steven Brown of [[Wrexham]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jo |last=Kelly |url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/hillsborough/hillsborough-96/2009/04/15/steven-brown-25-100252-23391311/ |title=Steven Brown, 25 – Hillsborough 96 – Hillsborough Remembered |work=Liverpool Daily Post |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 30-year-old Peter Thompson of [[Widnes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Luke |last=Traynor |url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/hillsborough/hillsborough-96/2009/04/15/peter-thompson-30-100252-23388674/ |title=Peter Thompson, 30 – Hillsborough 96 – Hillsborough Remembered |work=Liverpool Daily Post |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon-Paul Gilhooley, aged 10, was the youngest person to die. His cousin, [[Steven Gerrard]], then aged 8, went on to become Liverpool F.C.'s captain.

Stephen Whittle is considered by some to be the 97th victim of Hillsborough, as due to work commitments, he had sold his ticket to a friend (whom he and his family chose not to identify), who then died in the disaster; the resulting feeling of [[survivor guilt]] is believed to be the main reason for his suicide in February 2011.&lt;ref name="theboltonnews.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/northwest/14458298.Hillsborough_s__97th_victim__remembered/ | work=The Bolton News | title=Hillsborough's '97th victim' remembered | date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of victims that lost their lives were from [[Liverpool]] (37) and [[Liverpool City Region|Greater Merseyside]] (20). A further 20 were from counties adjacent to Merseyside. An additional 3 victims came from Sheffield with 2 more living in counties adjacent to South Yorkshire. The remaining 14 victims lived in other parts of England.

===Ages===
Of those who died, 78 were aged under 30, 38 of whom were under 20, and all but three of the victims were aged under 50.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26765007 | publisher=BBC News | title=Hillsborough inquests: The 96 who died | date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1989-91 coroner's hearing==
[[Inquest]]s into the deaths were opened and adjourned immediately after the disaster.

Resumed on 19 November 1990,&lt;ref name="hillsborough.independent.gov.uk"/&gt; they proved to be controversial. South Yorkshire coroner Dr Stefan Popper limited the main inquests to events up to 3:15&amp;nbsp;pm on the day of the disaster – nine minutes after the match was halted and the crowd spilled onto the pitch. Popper said this was because the victims were either dead, or brain dead, by 3:15&amp;nbsp;pm. The decision angered the families, many of whom felt the inquests were unable to consider the response of the police and other emergency services after that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Conn |first=David |title=Hillsborough: how stories of disaster police were altered |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/13/hillsborough-disaster-police-south-yorkshire-liverpool |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inquests returned verdicts of accidental death on 26 March 1991, much to the dismay of the bereaved families, who had been hoping for a verdict of unlawful killing or an open verdict, and for manslaughter charges to be brought against the officers who had been present at the disaster. Trevor Hicks, whose two daughters had been killed, described the verdicts as 'lawful' but 'immoral'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/timeline-27-year-fight-truth-11224792|title=Timeline of a 27 year fight for the truth after the Hillsborough disaster|first=Paddy|last=Shennan|date=26 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popper's decision regarding the cut-off time was subsequently endorsed by the Divisional Court who considered it to have been justified in the light of the medical evidence available to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/HOM000038090001.html |title=Judgement of Divisional Court, 5 November 1993 application to quash the Inquest verdicts of six of the Hillsborough victims &amp;#124; Hillsborough Independent Panel |publisher=Hillsborough.independent.gov.uk |date=5 November 1993 |accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatives later failed to have the inquests reopened to allow more scrutiny of police actions and closer examination of the circumstances of individual cases.

Families believed that Popper was 'too close' to the police. After the verdicts Barry Devonside, who had lost his son, witnessed Popper hosting a celebration party with police officers.&lt;ref name="assets.publishing.service.gov.uk"&gt;https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/656130/6_3860_HO_Hillsborough_Report_2017_FINAL_updated.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the individual cases where the circumstances of death were not fully resolved was that of Kevin Williams, the fifteen-year-old son of [[Anne Williams (activist)|Anne Williams]]. Anne Williams, who died in 2013, rejected the coroner's decision that the Hillsborough victims, including her son, had died before 3:15&amp;nbsp;pm, citing witness statements that described him showing signs of life at 4:00&amp;nbsp;pm. She unsuccessfully appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2009/03/31/european-court-blow-for-mother-of-hillsborough-victim-92534-23272563/ European court blow for mother of Hillsborough victim] ''Liverpool Daily Post'', 31 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Hillsborough Independent Panel considered the available evidence and stated that "the initial pathologist's opinion appeared definitive, but further authoritative opinions raised significant doubts about the accuracy of that initial opinion."&lt;ref name="hip_report"/&gt;{{rp|313}}

Popper had excluded the witness evidence of two qualified Merseyside doctors (Drs Ashton and Phillips) who had been inside the stadium on the day and who had been critical of the chaotic emergency response.&lt;ref&gt;http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/docs/HOM000037950001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The views of both were dismissed by the Taylor report. They both gave evidence at the [[Hillsborough disaster#Second coroner's hearing|2016 Warrington inquests]].&lt;ref name="vindication"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/two-doctors-who-criticised-hillsborough-11249313|title=Two doctors who criticised Hillsborough ambulance response speak of "vindication" after inquests|last=Barlow|first=Eleanor|date=27 April 2016|publisher=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phillips, stated that the exclusion of their evidence was a 'serious error of judgement' by Popper. He expressed that he 'could not fathom why he didn't call us, other than he specifically did not want to hear our evidence, in which case the first inquests were coloured and flawed before they even started'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/two-doctors-who-criticised-hillsborough-11249313|title=The two doctors who criticised the Hillsborough ambulance response|first=Eleanor|last=Barlow|date=27 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashton and Phillips were not the only doctors present at the disaster not to be called to give evidence to the Popper inquests. The only one called was the Sheffield Wednesday club doctor.&lt;ref&gt;http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/docs/SPP000001790001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taylor Inquiry==
{{Main|Taylor Report}}
After the disaster, [[Peter Taylor, Baron Taylor of Gosforth|Lord Justice Taylor]] was appointed to conduct an inquiry into the events. The Taylor Inquiry sat for a total of 31 days (between 15 May and 29 June 1989) and published two reports: an interim report (1 August 1989) which laid out the events of the day and immediate conclusions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Taylor |first=Lord Justice |authorlink=Peter Taylor, Baron Taylor of Gosforth |date=August 1989 |title=Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry – Interim Report |url=http://www.southyorks.police.uk/sites/default/files/Taylor%20Interim%20Report.pdf |accessdate=18 September 2012 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619160223/http://www.southyorks.police.uk/sites/default/files/Taylor%20Interim%20Report.pdf |archivedate=19 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the final report (19 January 1990) which outlined general recommendations on football ground safety. This became known as the Taylor Report.

Taylor concluded that policing on the day "broke down" and "the main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control".&lt;ref name="taylor 49"/&gt; Attention was focused on the decision to open the secondary gates; moreover, the kick-off should have been delayed, as had been done at other venues and matches.

Sheffield Wednesday was also criticised for the inadequate number of turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end and the poor quality of the crush barriers on the terraces, "respects in which failure by the Club contributed to this disaster".&lt;ref name="taylor 52"&gt;Taylor (1989), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police control===
Taylor found there was "no provision" for controlling the entry of spectators into the turnstile area. He dismissed the claim by senior police officers that they had no reason to anticipate problems, since congestion had occurred at both the 1987 and 1988 semi-finals.&lt;ref name="taylor 36"&gt;Taylor (1989), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; He said that "the Operational Order and police tactics on the day failed to provide for controlling a concentrated arrival of large numbers should that occur in a short period. That it might so occur was foreseeable".&lt;ref name="taylor 47"&gt;Taylor (1989), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure by the police to give the order to direct fans to empty areas of the stadium, was described by Taylor as "a blunder of the first magnitude".&lt;ref name="taylor 40"&gt;Taylor (1989), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no means for calculating when individual enclosures had reached capacity. A police officer ordinarily made a visual assessment before guiding fans to other pens.&lt;ref name="taylor 23"&gt;Taylor (1989), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the day of the disaster, "by 2.52&amp;nbsp;pm when gate C was opened, pens 3 and 4 were over-full [...] to allow any more into those pens was likely to cause injuries; to allow in a large stream was courting disaster".&lt;ref name="taylor 32"&gt;Taylor (1989), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report noted that the official capacity of the central pens was 2,200, that the [[Health and Safety Executive]] found this should have been reduced to 1,693 due to crush barriers and perimeter gates,&lt;ref name="taylor 24"&gt;Taylor (1989), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; but actually an estimated 3,000 people were in the pens around 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm. The report said "When spectators first appeared on the track, the immediate assumption in the control room was that a pitch invasion was threatened. This was unlikely at the beginning of a match. It became still less likely when those on the track made no move towards the pitch. ... [T]here was no effective leadership either from control or on the pitch to harness and organise rescue efforts. No orders were given for officers to enter the tunnel and relieve pressure".&lt;ref name="taylor 44"&gt;Taylor (1989), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Further that: "The anxiety to protect the sanctity of the pitch has caused insufficient attention to be paid to the risk of a crush due to overcrowding".&lt;ref name="taylor 46"&gt;Taylor (1989), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Taylor regarded spectator allocation as irrelevant to the disaster. "I do not consider choice of ends was causative of the disaster. Had it been reversed, the disaster could well have occurred in a similar manner but to Nottingham supporters".&lt;ref name="taylor 49"&gt;Taylor (1989), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Taylor noted with regard to the performance of the senior police officers in command that "...neither their handling of the problems on the day nor their account of it in evidence showed the qualities of leadership to be expected of their rank" &lt;ref name="taylor 49"/&gt;

===Behaviour of fans===
Lord Taylor concluded that the behaviour of Liverpool fans, including accusations of drunkenness, were secondary factors, and said that most fans were: "not drunk, nor even the worse for drink". He concluded that this formed an exacerbating factor&lt;ref name="taylor 34"&gt;Taylor (1989), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; but that police, seeking to rationalise their loss of control, overestimated the element of drunkenness in the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/docs/HWP000000180001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The report dismissed the theory, put forward by South Yorkshire Police, that fans attempting to gain entry without tickets or with forged tickets were contributing factors.&lt;ref name="taylor 36"/&gt;

===Emergency response===
Taylor concluded that in responding to the disaster there had been no fault on the part of the emergency services (St Johns Ambulance, South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service and fire brigade).&lt;ref name="taylor 53"&gt;Taylor (1989), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police evasion===
Taylor concluded his criticism of South Yorkshire Police by describing senior officers in command as "defensive and evasive witnesses" who refused to accept any responsibility for error: "In all some 65 police officers gave oral evidence at the Inquiry. Sadly I must report that for the most part the quality of their evidence was in inverse proportion to their rank".&lt;ref name="taylor 49"/&gt; Further stating: "South Yorkshire Police were not prepared to concede they were in any respect at fault in what occurred. ... [T]he police case was to blame the fans for being late and drunk, and to blame the Club for failing to monitor the pens. ... Such an unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether lessons have been learnt".&lt;ref name="taylor 50"&gt;Taylor (1989), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on stadiums in Britain===
[[File:The_New_Den_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1143517.jpg|thumb|[[The Den]], opened in 1993, became the first new stadium fully compliant with the safety recommendations of the [[Taylor Report]].]]
The Taylor Report had a deep impact on safety standards for stadiums in the UK. Perimeter and lateral fencing was removed and many top stadiums were converted to [[All-seater stadium|all-seated]].&lt;ref name="A hard lesson to learn"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/318497.stm |title=A hard lesson to learn |date=15 April 1999 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=4 August 2007 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purpose-built stadiums for [[Premier League]] and most [[Football League]] teams since the report are all-seater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.millwall-history.co.uk/the_den5.htm |title=The Architects Journal:Building Study (September 1993) |publisher=Millwall-history.co.uk |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chester City F.C.]]'s [[Deva Stadium]] was the first English football stadium to fulfil the safety recommendations of the Taylor Report, with [[Millwall F.C.]]'s [[The Den]] being the first new stadium to be built that fulfilled the recommendations.

In July 1992, the government announced a relaxation of the regulation for the lower two English leagues (known now as League One and League Two). The Football Spectators Act does not cover Scotland, but the [[Scottish Premier League]] chose to make all-seater stadiums a requirement of league membership.&lt;ref&gt;SPL rules&lt;/ref&gt; In England and Wales all-seating is a requirement of the Premier League&lt;ref&gt;Premier League rules&lt;/ref&gt; and of the Football League for clubs who have been present in the Championship for more than three seasons.&lt;ref&gt;Football League rules&lt;/ref&gt;
Several campaigns have attempted to get the government to relax the regulation and allow standing areas to return to Premiership and Championship grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Stand Up Sit Down – A Choice to Watch Football. Peter Caton 2012. Troubador. {{ISBN|978-1-78088-177-5}} Chapters 23 – 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stuart-Smith scrutiny==
In May 1997, when the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] came into office, Home Secretary [[Jack Straw]] ordered an investigation. It was performed by [[Murray Stuart-Smith|Lord Justice Stuart-Smith]].&lt;ref name="scrutiny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contrast.org/hillsborough/history/stuartsmith.shtm |title=The Stuart Smith Scrutiny – Hillsborough Football Disaster |publisher=Contrast.org |accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment of Stuart-Smith was not without controversy. At a meeting in Liverpool with relatives of those involved in Hillsborough in October 1997, he flippantly remarked "Have you got a few of your people or are they like the Liverpool fans, turn up at the last minute?"&lt;ref name="scrutiny"/&gt; He later apologised for his remark, saying it was not intended to offend.&lt;ref name="scrutiny"/&gt; The terms of reference of his inquiry were limited to "new evidence", that is "...evidence which was not available or was not presented to the previous inquiries, courts or authorities."&lt;ref name="scrutiny"/&gt; Therefore, evidence such as witness statements which had been altered were classed as [[admissible evidence|inadmissible]].
When he presented his report in February 1998, he concluded that there was insufficient evidence for a new inquiry into the disaster. In paragraph 5 of his summary, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have come to the clear conclusion that there is no basis upon which there should be a further Judicial Inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor's Inquiry. There is no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act 1988. I do not consider that there is any material which should be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken. Nor do I consider that there is any justification for setting up any further inquiry into the performance of the emergency and hospital services. I have considered the circumstances in which alterations were made to some of the self-written statements of South Yorkshire Police officers, but I do not consider that there is any occasion for any further investigation.&lt;ref name="Stuart-Smith Review"&gt;Stuart-Smith, Murray. [http://www.southyorks.police.uk/sites/default/files/STUART%20SMITH%20ENQUIRY%20REPORT.pdf Scrutiny of Evidence Relating to the Hillsborough Football Stadium Disaster] London, The Stationery Office, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Importantly, Stuart-Smith's report supported the [[coroner]]'s assertion that evidence after 3.15&amp;nbsp;pm was inadmissible as "that by 3.15&amp;nbsp;pm the principal cause of death, that is, the crushing, was over."&lt;ref name="HansardMay98"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo980508/debtext/80508-01.htm|title=8 May 1998 : Column 941|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was controversial as the subsequent response of the police and emergency services would not be scrutinised. Announcing the report to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], Home Secretary Jack Straw backed Stuart-Smith's findings and said that "I do not believe that a further inquiry could or would uncover significant new evidence or provide any relief for the distress of those who have been bereaved."&lt;ref name="HansardMay98"/&gt; However the determination by Stuart-Smith was heavily criticised by the Justice Minister, [[Charles Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton|Lord Falconer]], who stated "I am absolutely sure that Sir Murray Stuart-Smith came completely to the wrong conclusion".&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15433324|title=Hillsborough inquiry by Blair government criticised|publisher=BBC News|date=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falconer added: "It made the families in the Hillsborough disaster feel after one establishment cover-up, here was another."&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

==Hillsborough Independent Panel==
The Hillsborough Independent Panel was instituted in 2009 by the British government to investigate the Hillsborough disaster, to oversee the disclosure of documents about the disaster and its aftermath and to produce a report. On 12 September 2012, it published its report and simultaneously launched a website containing 450,000 pages of material&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/ |title=Hillsborough Independent Panel |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2012 |website=Hillsborough Independent Panel: Disclosed Material and Report |access-date=27 April 2016 |quote=Over 450,000 pages reviewed – Documents and other material from the contributing organisations including reports, minutes of meetings, transcripts, witness statements, letters and memos, records of telephone calls.}}&lt;/ref&gt; collated from 85 organisations and individuals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/contributors/ |title=Organisations and people whose material has been reviewed |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2012 |website=Hillsborough Independent Panel: Disclosed Material and Report |access-date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; over two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Conn |first=David |date=12 September 2012 |title=Hillsborough panel set to publish report on 1989 disaster |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-panel-publish-report |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
In the years after the disaster, the Hillsborough Family Support Group, had campaigned for the release of all relevant documents into the public domain. After the disaster's 20th anniversary in April 2009, supported by the [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport|Culture secretary]], Andy Burnham, and [[Ministry of Justice|Minister of State for Justice]], [[Maria Eagle]], the government asked the [[Home Office]] and [[Department of Culture, Media and Sport]] to investigate the best way for this information to be made public.&lt;ref name="Hansard1209"/&gt; In April 2009, the Home Secretary [[Jacqui Smith]] announced she had requested secret files concerning the disaster be made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/8006744.stm |title=Hillsborough files may be opened |publisher=BBC News |date=19 April 2009 |accessdate=19 April 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Home Secretary [[Alan Johnson]] said the Hillsborough Independent Panel's remit would be to oversee "full public disclosure of relevant government and local information within the limited constraints set out in the disclosure protocol" and "consult with the Hillsborough families to ensure that the views of those most affected by the disaster are taken into account".&lt;ref name="Hansard1209"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/wmstext/91215m0004.htm|title=Parliamentary business|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|date=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An archive of all relevant documentation would be created and a report produced within two years explaining the work of the panel and its conclusions.

The panel was chaired by [[James Jones (bishop)|James Jones]], the [[Bishop of Liverpool]]. Other members were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news//tm_headline=who-are-the-members-of-the-hillsborough-independent-panel%26method=full%26objectid=31815017%26siteid=100252-name_page.html|title=Who are the members of the Hillsborough Independent Panel?|work=Liverpool Echo|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Findings===
On 12 September 2012, the Hillsborough Independent Panel&lt;ref&gt;[http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/ Home Page] Hillsborough Independent Report&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that no Liverpool fans were responsible in any way for the disaster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Page 14 – Hillsborough Independent Panel|url=http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/report/Section-1/summary/page-14/|work=Hillsborough Independent Panel Report|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that its main cause was a "lack of police control". Crowd safety was "compromised at every level" and overcrowding issues had been recorded two years earlier. The panel concluded that "up to 41" of the 96 who perished might have survived had the emergency services' reactions and co-ordination been improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-inquest-prosecutions-report |title=Hillsborough disaster: new inquest likely after damning report|work= The Guardian|date=13 September 2012|accessdate=22 March 2013|first1=Owen|last1=Gibson|first2=David|last2=Conn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number is based on post-mortem examinations which found some victims may have had heart, lung or blood circulation function for some time after being removed from the crush. The report stated that placing fans who were "merely unconscious" on their backs rather than in the [[recovery position]], would have resulted in their deaths due to [[airway obstruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tozer |first=James |title=41 could have survived stadium crush|newspaper= [[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |date=14 September 2012 |page= 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their report was in 395 pages and delivered 153 key findings.

The findings concluded that 164 witness statements had been altered. Of those statements, 116 were amended to remove or change negative comments about South Yorkshire Police. South Yorkshire Police had performed blood alcohol tests on the victims, some of them children, and ran computer checks on the [[Police National Computer|national police database]] in an attempt to "impugn their reputation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-report-panel-released-live|title=Hillsborough disaster report published |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=12 September 2012 |first=Haroon |last=Siddique}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report concluded that the then Conservative MP for [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]], [[Irvine Patnick]], passed inaccurate and untrue information from the police to the press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/hillsborough-files-calls-to-strip-sir-irvine-patnick-of-knighthood-over-hillsborough-role-1-2522157 Hillsborough files: Calls to strip Sir Irvine Patnick of knighthood] ''The Scotsman''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hillsborough: The Report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel'', pages 350–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel noted that, despite being dismissed by the Taylor Report, the idea that alcohol contributed to the disaster proved remarkably durable. Documents disclosed confirm that repeated attempts were made to find supporting evidence for alcohol being a factor, and that available evidence was significantly misinterpreted. It noted "The weight placed on alcohol in the face of objective evidence of a pattern of consumption modest for a leisure event was inappropriate. It has since fuelled persistent and unsustainable assertions about drunken fan behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/report/Section-1/summary/page-5/ |title=Page 4 &amp;#124; Home Office |publisher=Hillsborough.independent.gov.uk |date=15 April 1989 |accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence it released online, included altered police reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-report-panel-released-live|title=Hillsborough Disaster Report Published – Wednesday 12 September|access-date=8 March 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===
Subsequent apologies were released by Prime Minister David Cameron on behalf of the government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-19543964 | title = Hillsborough papers: Cameron apology over "double injustice" | date = 12 September 2012 | accessdate =12 September 2012 |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ed Miliband]] on behalf of the [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|opposition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hillsborough statement: Cameron and Miliband apologise|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/house_of_commons/newsid_9750000/9750850.stm|work=BBC Democracy Live|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 September 2012|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, South Yorkshire Police, and former editor of ''The Sun'', Kelvin MacKenzie, who apologised for making false accusations under the headline "The Truth".&lt;ref name=mackenzie&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.itv.com/news/update/2012-09-12/kelvin-mckenzie-offers-profuse-apologies-over-hillsborough/ | title = Kelvin MacKenzie offers 'profuse apologies' over Hillsborough | publisher = [[ITV.com]] | date = 12 September 2012 | accessdate = 12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacKenzie said he should have written a headline that read "The Lies", although this apology was widely discredited by the Hillsborough Family Support Group and Liverpool fans, as it was seen to be "shifting the blame once again."&lt;ref name=mackenzie/&gt;

After publication, the Hillsborough Families Support Group called for new inquests for the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Press Association|title=Hillsborough families demand new inquests be held|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/17/hillsborough-families-seek-new-inquest|accessdate=5 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also called for prosecutions for unlawful killing, corporate manslaughter and perversion of the course of justice in respect of the actions of the police both in causing the disaster and covering up their actions; and in respect of Sheffield Wednesday FC, Sheffield Council and the Football Association for their various responsibilities for providing, certifying and selecting the stadium for the fatal event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gibson|first=Owen|title=New Hillsborough inquest likely after damning report|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-inquest-prosecutions-report|accessdate=5 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 September 2012|first2=David |last2=Conn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 October 2012, Norman Bettison resigned with immediate effect as Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police, after [[Maria Eagle]] MP on the floor of the House and protected by [[Parliamentary privilege]], accused him of boasting about concocting a story that all the Liverpool fans were drunk and police were afraid they were going to break down the gates and decided to open them.&lt;ref name="hansard"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eagle|first=Maria|title=22 Oct 2012 : Column 765|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102226000184|work=Hansard|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dodd|first=Vikram|title=Hillsborough: Norman Bettison resigns from West Yorkshire police|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/24/norman-bettison-resigns-hillsborough-west-yorkshire|accessdate=24 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Conn|first=David|title=Hillsborough: police chief 'boasted' of role in smearing fans|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/23/hillsborough-police-chief-bettison-eagle|accessdate=24 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bettison denied the claim, and other allegations about his conduct, saying: "Fans' behaviour, to the extent that it was relevant at all, made the job of the police, in the crush outside Leppings Lane turnstiles, harder than it needed to be.

==Second coroner's hearing==
Following an application on 19 December 2012 by the [[Attorney General]] [[Dominic Grieve]], the High Court quashed the verdicts in the original inquests and ordered fresh inquests to be held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BAILII|accessdate=12 November 2015|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2012/3783.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Goldring|Sir John Goldring]] was appointed as Assistant Coroner for South Yorkshire (East) and West Yorkshire (West) to conduct those inquests. The inquests hearings started on Monday 31 March 2014 at [[Warrington]]. Transcripts of the proceedings and evidence that was produced during the hearings were published at the Hillsborough Inquests official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hillsboroughinquests.independent.gov.uk/|title=Hillsborough Inquests|accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April 2016, the nine jurors were sent out to consider their verdicts.

On the day after the verdicts were reached the Home Secretary, [[Theresa May]], made a statement to Parliament which included the verdicts of the jury to the fourteen questions they had been asked regarding the roles of South Yorkshire police, the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service, Sheffield Wednesday football club and Hillsborough stadium's engineers and two specific questions specific relating to the time and cause of death for each of the dead. In addition to the "unlawful killing" verdict, the jury concluded that "errors or omissions" by police commanding officers, Sheffield Wednesday, the ambulance service and the design and certification of the stadium had all "caused or contributed" to the deaths, but that the behaviour of football supporters had not. In all but one case, the jury recorded the time of death as later than the 3.15 pm cut-off point adopted by the coroner at the original inquests.&lt;ref name="Hansard27416"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-04-27/debates/16042756000001/Hillsborough|title=Hillsborough - Statement|date=27 April 2016|work=[[Hansard]] volume 608|publisher=UK Parliament|pages=Column 1433|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] also responded to the April 2016 verdict by saying that it represented a "long overdue" but "landmark moment in the quest for justice", adding "All families and survivors now have official confirmation of what they always knew was the case, that the Liverpool fans were utterly blameless in the disaster that unfolded at Hillsborough."&lt;ref name="Morris April 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Nigel|title=Hillsborough inquest suggests police 'should be prosecuted'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/hillsborough-police-should-be-prosecuted-for-role-in-the-disaster-inquest-says-a7002126.html|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=The Independent|date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] described the handling of the Hillsborough disaster as the "greatest miscarriage of justice of our times", with Labour MPs [[Andy Burnham]] and [[Steve Rotheram]] calling for accountability and the prosecution of those responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Joshua|title=Calls for prosecutions after 'greatest miscarriage of justice of our times'|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/hillsborough-greatest-miscarriage-justice-times-11243404|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=Liverpool Echo|date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Labour Party: 'Greatest miscarriage of justice of our times'|url=http://www.itv.com/news/granada/2016-04-26/labour-party-greatest-miscarriage-of-justice-of-our-times/|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=ITV News|date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] MP [[John Pugh]] called for David Cameron to make a formal apology in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to the families of those killed at Hillsborough and to the city of Liverpool as a whole.&lt;ref name="Morris April 2016" /&gt;

During the inquests, Maxwell Groome – a police constable at the time of the disaster – made allegations of a high-level "conspiracy" by [[Freemasons]] to shift blame for the disaster onto Superintendent Roger Marshall, also that junior officers were pressured into changing their statements after the disaster, and told not to write their accounts in their official police pocketbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conn|first1=David|title=Freemason police officers tried to 'shift blame' after Hillsborough disaster, inquest told|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/17/hillsborough-disaster-police-masonic-conspiracy|accessdate=2 June 2016|work=The Guardian|date=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groome also claimed that match commander Duckenfield was a member of the "highly influential" Dole lodge in Sheffield (the same lodge as Brian Mole, his predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barlow|first1=Eleanor|title=Hillsborough: David Duckenfield was in same Masons lodge as officer he replaced|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/hillsborough-commander-david-duckenfield-same-8124374|accessdate=2 June 2016|work=Liverpool Echo|date=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Coroner Sir John Goldring warned the jury that there was "not a shred of evidence" that any Masonic meeting actually took place, or that those named were all Freemasons,&lt;ref name=MtrMsn&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nagesh|first1=Ashitha|title=Hillsborough tragedy: Did the Freemasons influence the Police?|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/04/26/hillsborough-tragedy-did-the-freemasons-influence-the-police-5842965/|accessdate=2 June 2016|work=Metro|date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; advising the jury to cast aside "gossip and hearsay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pilling|first1=Kim|title=Did Freemasons influence police over Hillsborough?|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/did-freemasons-influence-police-over-hillsborough-1-4111564|accessdate=2 June 2016|work=The Scotsman|publisher=Johnston Press|date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the inquests, Duckenfield confirmed that he became a Freemason in 1975 and became [[Worshipful Master]] of his local lodge in 1990, a year after the disaster; following this revelation, Freemasons were forbidden to take part in the IPCC investigation and Operation Resolve as civilian investigators to prevent any perceived bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/hillsborough-freemason-cops-banned-working-2366200|title=Hillsborough: Freemason cops banned from working on criminal probe into cover-up|first=Justin|last=Penrose|date=13 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kay2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kay|first1=Dan|title=Freemasons barred from investigation into alleged Hillsborough 'cover-up'|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/freemasons-barred-investigation-alleged-hillsborough-10684791|accessdate=2 June 2016|work=Liverpool Echo|date=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crowcroft2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crowcroft|first1=Orlando|title=Hillsborough disaster: Why have freemasons been banned from the 1989 tragedy 'cover up' probe?|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hillsborough-disaster-why-have-freemasons-been-banned-1989-tragedy-cover-probe-1536829|accessdate=2 June 2016|work=International Business Times UK|date=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation===
Following the inquests verdicts, South Yorkshire police announced it would refer the actions of its officers to the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Laville|first=Sandra|title=South Yorkshire police to ask IPCC to investigate Hillsborough officers' conduct|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/13/hillsborough-south-yorkshire-police-ippcc|accessdate=5 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Yorkshire Police announced it would refer its Chief Constable, [[Norman Bettison]], to the IPCC in mid September.

The IPCC announced on 12 October 2012 that it would investigate the failure of the police to declare a major incident, failure to close the tunnel to the stands which led to overcrowded pens despite evidence it had been closed in such circumstances in the past; changes made to the statements of police officers; actions which misled Parliament and the media; shortcomings of previous investigations; and the role played by Norman Bettison.

By 22 October 2012, the names of at least 1,444 serving and former police officers had been referred to the IPCC investigation. In its announcement, the IPCC praised the tenacity of the Hillsborough families' campaign for truth and justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gibson|first=Owen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/12/hillsborough-disaster-new-evidence-ipcc|title=Hillsborough disaster: the new evidence under IPCC investigation|accessdate=2 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gibson|first=Owen|title=Hillsborough disaster: watchdog to launch biggest ever inquiry into police|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/12/hillsborough-disaster-biggest-inquiry-police|accessdate=12 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Conn|first=David|title=IPCC Hillsborough inquiry is another vindication for families|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/12/ipcc-hillsborough-inquiry-vindication-families|accessdate=12 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hillsborough probe 'to be UK's biggest into police conduct'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19922092|accessdate=12 October 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hillsborough: 1,444 police names passed to IPCC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20035472|accessdate=24 October 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 October 2012, the Attorney General announced in Parliament he had applied to have the original inquests verdicts quashed, arguing it proceeded on a false basis and evidence now to hand required this exceptional step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hillsborough: Application for new inquests|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-19960279|accessdate=16 October 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 July 2013, it was reported that the IPCC had found that in addition to the now 164 police statements known to have been altered, a further 55 police officers had changed their statements. Deborah Glass, deputy chair of the IPCC said, "We know the people who have contacted us are the tip of the iceberg." That was after the IPCC's Hillsborough Contact team had received 230 pieces of correspondence since October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Documents/publications/Hillsborough_update_July_2013.PDF |title=Hillsborough Investigation Update: Independent Police Complaints Commission |publisher=ipcc.gov.uk |date=11 July 2013 |accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPCC is also investigating the actions of [[West Midlands Police]], who in 1989 had been tasked with investigating South Yorkshire Police's conduct for both the original inquests and also the Taylor independent inquiry.&lt;ref name="IPCC19"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/02/hillsborough-disaster-ipcc-inquiry-west-midlands-police|title=Hillsborough: 19 people refuse to help IPCC inquiry|date=2 June 2016|work=The Guardian|agency=Press Association|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-23290122 |publisher=BBC News |title=Hillsborough probe finds more police statements changed |date=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] announced that it would consider bringing charges against both individuals and corporate bodies once the criminal investigation by the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] – Operation Resolve – had been completed.&lt;ref name=CPS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cps.gov.uk/news/latest_news/cps_statement_following_hillsborough_inquest_verdict/ |title=Statements from the CPS, IPCC and Operation Resolve following Hillsborough inquests verdict |publisher=Crown Prosecution Service |accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==='The patronising disposition of unaccountable power' report===

Commissioned by the Home Secretary Theresa May, a report was published on 1 November 2017 by the Right Reverend James Jones titled ''The patronising disposition of unaccountable power : A report to ensure that the pain and suffering of the Hillsborough families is not repeated''.&lt;ref name="assets.publishing.service.gov.uk"/&gt;

==Criminal and civil cases==

===Prosecutions===
In February 2000, a [[private prosecution]] was brought against [[Chief Superintendent]] David Duckenfield and another officer, Bernard Murray. The prosecution argued that the crush was "foreseeable" hence the defendants were "grossly negligent".&lt;ref name="Tragedy to truth" /&gt; Prosecutor Alun Jones told the court that Duckenfield gave the order to open the gates so that hundreds of fans could be herded on to the already crowded terraces at the stadium. Jones stated that minutes after the disaster, Duckenfield "deceitfully and dishonestly" told senior FA officials that the supporters had forced the gate open. Duckenfield admitted he had lied in certain statements regarding the causes of the disaster. The prosecution ended on 24 July 2000, when Murray was acquitted and the jury was unable to reach a verdict in the case of Duckenfield. On 26 July 2000, the judge refused the prosecution's application for a re-trial of Duckenfield.&lt;ref name="Tragedy to truth" /&gt;

Police disciplinary charges were abandoned when Duckenfield retired on health grounds and, because he was unavailable, it was decided it would be unfair to proceed with disciplinary charges against Bernard Murray. Duckenfield took medical retirement on a full police pension.&lt;ref name="Straw"&gt;{{cite news |title=Straw backs Hillsborough officer |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/209499.stm |date=6 November 1998 |accessdate=11 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Police blame fans"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hillsborough police 'blamed fans' |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/788990.stm|date=13 June 2000|accessdate=11 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jury"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hillsborough jury discharged |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/848798.stm |date=24 July 2000 |accessdate=11 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Home Secretary [[Theresa May]] announced on 18 December 2012 that a new police enquiry would be initiated to examine the possibility of charging agencies other than the police over the Hillsborough deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Doyle |first=Mario Ledwith, Jack, |title=Fresh hopes for prosecutions over Hillsborough Disaster as police launch new investigation and High Court quashes accidental death inquest verdicts on 96 fans |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2250534/Police-launch-new-investigation-Hillsborough-Disaster-High-Court-quashes-accidental-death-inquest-verdicts-96-fans.html |work=Daily Mail |accessdate=22 December 2012 |date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enquiry was headed by former Durham Chief Constable Jon Stoddart.

On 28 June 2017, it was announced that six people were to be charged with offences in relation to the disaster. Former Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield, in charge of the match, faces 95 counts of [[manslaughter|manslaughter by gross negligence]]. He faces no charge in respect of the death of Tony Bland, who died four years after the disaster. Former Chief Inspector Sir Norman Bettinson faces four counts of [[misconduct in public office]]. Former Sheffield Wednesday F.C. Club Secretary Graham Mackrell faces a charge of breaching the Safety at Sports Ground Act 1975. Solicitor Peter Metcalf, former Chief Superintendent Donald Denton and former Detective Chief Inspector Alan Foster were all charged with [[perverting the course of justice]].&lt;ref name=BBC40419819&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-40419819 |title=David Duckenfield faces 95 Hillsborough manslaughter charges |publisher=BBC News Online |accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IPCCtweet&gt;{{cite tweet |number=880007924696965120 |title=(untitled) |user=IPCCNews |author=[[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] |date=28 June 2017 |accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August, all except Duckenfield appeared at [[Warrington]] Magistrates Court. Mackrell pleaded not guilty to the charge against him. No formal pleas were taken from the other four defendants. All five were bailed to appear at the [[Crown Court]] on 6 September. Duckenfield was not required to appear as the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS) needed to apply to the High Court to lift a court order before he can be prosecuted on the manslaughter charges.&lt;ref name=BBC40877811&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-40877811 |title=Hillsborough disaster accused appear in court |publisher=BBC News Online |accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 June 2018, a ruling was made that Duckenfield would be prosecuted on the manslaughter charges.&lt;ref name=Sky11420746&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.sky.com/story/hillsborough-match-commander-david-duckenfield-can-face-trial-11420746 |title=Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield can face trial |publisher=Sky News |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, it was announced that a police officer and a [[farrier]] would not be prosecuted over allegations that they fabricated a story about a police horse being burned with cigarettes at Hillsborough. Although there was enough evidence to charge the farrier with perverting the course of justice, it was felt not to be in the public interest to charge him. There was insufficient evidence against the police officer to charge him with the offence.&lt;ref name=BBC42365516&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-42365516 |title=Hillsborough officer not charged over horse burn claims |publisher=BBC News Online |accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 August 2018, it was announced that all charges against Bettison were being dropped as the CPS felt that there was insufficient evidence to have a realistic chance of a conviction. The death of two witnesses and contradictions in the evidence of others was cited as part of the reason for the decision. Representatives of the 96 victims of the disaster stated that they would be asking for an independent review of the decision under the Right to Review Scheme.&lt;ref name=BBC45258766&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-45258766 |title=Hillsborough charges against Sir Norman Bettison dropped |publisher=BBC News Online |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 2018, at a trial preparation hearing at Preston Crown Court, Duckenfield pleaded not guilty to all 95 charges against him. Mackrell pleaded not guilty to the two charges against him. A provisional trial date of 14 January 2019 was set.&lt;ref name=BBC45471339&gt;{{cite we |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-45471339 |title=Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield denies manslaughter |publisher=BBC News Online |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various negligence cases were brought against the police by spectators who had been at the ground but had not been in the pens, and by people who watched the incident unfolding on television (or heard about it on the radio). A case, ''[[Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police]]'' [1992] 1 A.C. 310, was eventually appealed to the Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]] and was an important milestone in the law of claims of secondary victims for negligently inflicted psychiatric injury. It was held that claimants who watched the disaster on television/listened on radio were not '[[wikt:proximal|proximal]]' and their claims were rejected.

Another psychiatric injury claim was brought to the House of Lords, ''[[White v Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police]]'' [1999] 2 A.C. 455. It was brought by police officers on duty against the Chief Constable who was said to have been vicariously liable for the disaster. Their claims were dismissed and the Alcock decision was upheld. It affirmed the position of the courts once again towards claims of psychiatric injuries of secondary victims.

A third legal case which resulted from the Hillsborough disaster was ''Airedale N.H.S. Trust v Bland'' [1993] A.C. 789, a landmark [[House of Lords]] decision in [[English criminal law]], that allowed the life-support machine of [[Tony Bland]], a Hillsborough victim in a persistent vegetative state, to be switched off.

In April 2016, a private prosecution was launched on behalf of victims' relatives against both SYP and the West Midlands Police force (who had investigated the actions of SYP), alleging a concerted cover-up designed to shift blame away from the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Halliday |first1=Josh |last2=Bowcott |first2=Owen |date=28 April 2016 |title=Hillsborough families to sue police for 'abuse on industrial scale' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/28/hillsborough-families-to-sue-police-for-abuse-on-industrial-scale |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorial ceremonies===
The disaster has been acknowledged on 15 April each year by the community in Liverpool and football in general. An annual memorial ceremony is held at Anfield and at a church in Liverpool. The 10th and 20th anniversaries were marked by special services to remember the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/feb/18/uefa-liverpool-hillsborough-disaster-memorial-service|title=Uefa to help Liverpool Avoid Hillsborough Clash |newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 February 2009|access-date=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/04/99/hillsborough/319303.stm|title=Hillsborough 10 Years On|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2007, there was a Hillsborough Memorial service held at [[Spion Kop (hill)|Spion Kop]], KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa annually. The ceremony is held on the [[Spion Kop Battlefield]] which gave its name to the [[Spion Kop (stadiums)|Kop Stand]] at Anfield. There is a permanent memorial to the 96 fans who died, in the form of a bench in view of the battlefield at a nearby lodge. Dean Davis and David Walters, South African Liverpool supporters, are responsible for the service and the bench was commissioned by Guy Prowse in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/south-african-reds-to-hold-memorial|title=South African Reds to Hold Memorial|publisher=liverpoolfc.tv|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following on from, and out of respect for the Hillsborough families decision to conclude official memorials at Anfield {{as of|2016|lc=y}}; there will be no further Memorials held at Spion Kop. The Memorial bench remains at Spion Kop Lodge.

In 2014, the FA decided all FA Cup, Premier League, Football League and Football Conference matches played between 11–14 April, would kick-off seven minutes later than originally scheduled with a six-minute delay and a [[one-minute silence]] tribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2014/mar/hillsborough-kick-off-tribute-210314|title=Football to remember Hillsborough disaster |work=The FA |location=UK |date=21 March 2014 |accessdate=12 April 2014 |first=FA |last=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===10th anniversary===
In 1999, Anfield was packed with a crowd of around 10,000 people ten years after the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/a-minutes-silence-to-remember-hillsborough-1086572.html|title=A minute's silence to remember Hillsborough |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=11 April 1999 |accessdate=15 April 2009 |first=Lousie |last=Jury}}&lt;/ref&gt; A candle was lit for each of the 96 victims. The clock at the Kop End stood still at 3:06&amp;nbsp;pm, the time that the referee had blown his whistle in 1989 and a minute's silence was held, the start signalled by match referee from that day, Ray Lewis. A service led by the Right Reverend James Jones, the Bishop of Liverpool, was attended by past and present Liverpool players, including [[Robbie Fowler]], [[Steve McManaman]] and [[Alan Hansen]]. According to the BBC report: ''"The names of the victims were read from the memorial book and floral tributes were laid at a plaque bearing their names."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/319927.stm |title=Plea for Hillsborough justice |publisher=BBC News |date=15 April 1999 |accessdate=15 April 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A gospel choir performed and the ceremony ended with a rendition of "[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]". The anniversary was also marked by a minute's silence at the weekend's league games and FA Cup semi-finals.

===20th anniversary===
[[File:Hillsborough anniversary.JPG|thumb|Liverpool fans unfurl a banner displaying the names of the deceased on the 20th anniversary of the disaster]]
In 2009, on the 20th anniversary of the disaster, Liverpool's request that their [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League#Quarter-finals|Champions League quarter-finals return leg]], scheduled for 15 April, be played the day before was granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/liverpool-avoid-hillsborough-anniversary-clash-1650267.html |title=Liverpool avoid Hillsborough anniversary clash |date=20 March 2009 |agency=Reuters |work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was remembered with a ceremony at Anfield attended by over 28,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espnstar.com/football/fa-cup/news/detail/item247176/Reds-united-in-demanding-justice/ |title=Reds united in demanding justice |publisher=ESPN Star |date=16 April 2009 |accessdate=7 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721090718/http://www.espnstar.com/football/fa-cup/news/detail/item247176/Reds-united-in-demanding-justice/ |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liverpool 2009 tribute"&gt;{{cite news |title=Thousands flock to Anfield as Liverpool marks 20th anniversary of Hillsborough |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/hillsborough/hillsborough-news/2009/04/15/no-headline-100252-23393125/ |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kop, Centenary and Main Stands were opened to the public before part of the Anfield Road End was opened to supporters. The memorial service, led by the Bishop of Liverpool began at 14:45 [[British Summer Time|BST]] and a [[two-minute silence]] (observed across Liverpool and in Sheffield and Nottingham, including public transport coming to a stand-still)&lt;ref name="Nottingham tribute"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/homenews/Forest-flag-half-mast-ahead-Hillsborough-remembrance/article-903206-detail/article.html |title=Hundreds mark Hillsborough anniversary in city |work=Nottingham Post |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheffield Tribute"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sheffield's Hillsborough tribute |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/7999413.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=15 April 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held at the time of the disaster twenty years earlier, 15:06 BST. Sports Minister [[Andy Burnham]] addressed the crowd but was heckled by supporters chanting ''"Justice for the 96"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/liverpool/5160448/Liverpool-fans-turn-on-Andy-Burnham-at-Hillsborough-memorial.html |title=Liverpool fans turn on Andy Burnham |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=15 April 2009 |first=Jim |last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony was attended by survivors of the disaster, families of victims and the Liverpool team, with goalkeeper [[Pepe Reina]] leading the team and management staff onto the pitch. Team captain Steven Gerrard and vice-captain [[Jamie Carragher]] handed the [[freedom of the city]] to the families of all the victims. Candles were lit for each of the 96 people who died. [[Kenny Dalglish]], Liverpool's manager at the time of the disaster, read a passage from the Bible, "Lamentations of Jeremiah". The Liverpool manager, [[Rafael Benítez]], set 96 balloons free. The ceremony ended with 96 rings of church bells across the city and a rendition of "You'll Never Walk Alone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7999279.stm |title=Fans remember Hillsborough |publisher=BBC News |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other services took place at the same time, including at Liverpool's [[Liverpool Cathedral|Anglican]] and [[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral|Catholic Cathedrals]]. After the two minutes' silence, bells on civic buildings rang out throughout [[Merseyside]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southport.tv/page.php?id=Hillsborough-20th-Anniversary-Se |title=Southport.TV |publisher=Southport.TV |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A song was released to mark the 20th anniversary, entitled "[[Fields of Anfield Road]]" which peaked at No. 14 in the UK charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7957988.stm |title=Hillsborough tribute CD released |publisher=BBC News |date=22 March 2009 |accessdate=19 April 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liverpool, Chelsea, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] players showed respect by wearing black armbands during their [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League#Quarter-finals|Champions League matches]] on 14 and 15 April.

On 14 May, more than 20,000 people packed Anfield for a match held in memory of the victims. The Liverpool Legends, comprising ex-Liverpool footballers beat the All Stars, captained by actor [[Ricky Tomlinson]], 3–1. The event also raised cash for the Marina Dalglish Appeal which was contributed towards a radiotherapy centre at University Hospital in Aintree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2009/05/15/kenny-s-king-as-legends-triumph-100252-23632614/ |title=Kenny's king as Legends triumph |date=15 May 2009 |work=Liverpool Echo |accessdate=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/8051595.stm |title=Match marks Hillsborough tragedy |date=15 May 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=21 May 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the imminent release of police documents relating to events on 15 April 1989, the Hillsborough Family Support Group launched Project 96, a [[fundraising]] initiative on 1 August 2009. At least 96 current and former Liverpool footballers are being lined up to raise £96,000 by auctioning a limited edition (of 96) signed photographs.

On 11 April 2009, Liverpool fans sang "You'll Never Walk Alone" as a tribute to the upcoming anniversary of the disaster before the home game against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] (which ended in Liverpool winning 4–0) and was followed by former Liverpool player, [[Stephen Warnock]] presenting a memorial wreath to the Kop showing the figure '' 96 '' in red flowers.

===Other tributes===
The Hillsborough disaster touched not only Liverpool, but clubs in England and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Soccer Resumes, Sadly |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/23/sports/soccer-resumes-sadly.html |work=The New York Times |date=23 April 1989 |accessdate=29 December 2008 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], Liverpool's traditional local rivals, were affected, many of them having lost friends and family. Supporters laid down flowers and blue and white scarves to show respect for the dead and unity with fellow Merseysiders.

On 19 April 1989, the Wednesday after the disaster, the [[1988–89 European Cup#Semi-finals|European Cup semi-final]] tie between [[A.C. Milan]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] was played. The referee blew his whistle two minutes into the game to stop play and hold a minute's silence for those who lost their lives at Hillsborough.&lt;ref name="Milan - Real Madrid 19 April 1989 full match"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMRyFdrO8d8#t=0m05s|title=Milan vs Real Madrid |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halfway through the minute's silence, the A.C.

The occasion was the first in which the two teams had met since the 1985 Bradford City stadium fire that had claimed 56 lives at [[Valley Parade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redimps.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10440~1498199,00.html |title=We've Met (Bradford) Before |publisher=Redimps.co.uk |accessdate=26 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226000421/http://www.redimps.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10440~1498199%2C00.html |archivedate=26 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 1989, a match organised by [[Celtic F.C.]] was played at [[Celtic Park]], Glasgow between the home club and Liverpool, the proceeds going to the Hillsborough fund. Liverpool won the match by four goals to nil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecelticwiki.com/page/1989-04-30%3A+Celtic+0-4+Liverpool,+Hillsborough+Memorial+Match|title=1989-04-30: Celtic 0–4 Liverpool, Hillsborough Memorial Match}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the disaster, Liverpool's scheduled [[Liverpool 0–2 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|fixture against Arsenal]]{{efn| name=fixture |[British] a sports event that takes place on a particular date}} was delayed from 23 April until the end of the season and eventually decided the [[1988–89 Football League|league title]]. At this fixture, Arsenal players brought flowers onto the pitch and presented them to the Liverpool fans around the stadium before the game commenced.

During a 2011 debate in the House of Commons, the Labour MP for [[Liverpool Walton]], [[Steve Rotheram]], read out a list of the victims and, as a result, the names were entered into ''[[Hansard]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15345240 |title=MP's tearful tribute to Hillsborough 96 |publisher=BBC News |date=17 October 2011 |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2011/10/18/hillsborough-debate-full-transcript-read-everything-mps-said-in-the-house-of-commons-100252-29614413/ |title=Hillsborough debate full transcript: Read everything MPs said in the House of Commons – link to full video now added |work=Liverpool Echo |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

=== Media portrayal ===
Initial media coverage – spurred by what [[Phil Scraton]] calls in ''Hillsborough: The Truth'' "the [[Heysel Stadium disaster|Heysel factor"]] and [[Football hooliganism in the United Kingdom|"hooligan hysteria"]] – began to shift the blame onto the behaviour of the Liverpool fans at the stadium, making it a [[public order]] issue.&lt;ref name="Scraton2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Phil|last= Scraton|title=Hillsborough – The Truth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=whDM5Z2OuOMC&amp;pg=PA116|date=13 May 2011|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|isbn=978-1-78057-041-9|pages=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as ''The Sun''{{'}}s 19 April 1989 "The Truth" article (see below) other newspapers published similar allegations; the ''[[Daily Star (British newspaper)|Daily Star]]'' headline on the same day reported "Dead fans robbed by drunk thugs"; the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' accused the Liverpool fans of being "drunk and violent and their actions were vile", and ''[[The Daily Express]]'' ran a story alleging that "Police saw 'sick spectacle of pilfering from the dying'." Peter McKay in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' wrote that the "catastrophe was caused first and foremost by violent enthusiasm for soccer and in this case the tribal passions of Liverpool supporters [who] literally killed themselves and others to be at the game"&lt;ref name="Hillsborough and me" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hillsborough Report Chapter 12" /&gt; and published a front-page headline "Police attack 'vile' fans" on 18 April 1989, in which police sources blamed the behaviour of a section of Liverpool fans for the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|work=London Evening Standard|date=18 April 1989|page=1|title=Police attack 'vile' fans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Liverpool local journalist John Williams of the ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]'' wrote in an article titled "I Blame the Yobs"&lt;ref name="Contrast.org media react" /&gt; that "The gatecrashers wreaked their fatal havoc ... Their uncontrolled fanaticism and mass hysteria ... literally squeezed the life out of men, women and children ... yobbism at its most base ... Scouse killed Scouse for no better reason than 22 men were kicking a ball".&lt;ref name="Hillsborough and me"&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Kelvin|title=Hillsborough and me|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2012/09/hillsborough-and-me/|accessdate=30 April 2016|work=The Spectator|date=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hillsborough Report Chapter 12" /&gt;

In other regional newspapers, the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' wrote that the "Anfield Army charged on to the terrace behind the goal – many without tickets", and the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]'' wrote that the "trampling crush" had been started by "thousands of fans" who were "latecomers ... forc[ing] their way into the ground".&lt;ref name="Scraton2011" /&gt; The ''[[Sheffield Star]]'' published similar allegations to ''The Sun'', running the headline "Fans in Drunken Attacks on Police".&lt;ref name="Contrast.org media react"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contrast.org/hillsborough/history/media.shtm |title=The Immediate Aftermath – The Media Reaction – Hillsborough Football Disaster |publisher=Contrast.org |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the more serious allegations – such as stealing from the dead and assault of police officers and rescue workers – appeared on 18 April,&lt;ref name="Scraton2011" /&gt; although several evening newspapers published on 15 April 1989 also gave inaccurate reporting of the disaster, as these newspapers went to press before the full extent or circumstances of the disaster had been confirmed or even reported. This included the [[Wolverhampton]]-based ''[[Express &amp; Star]]'', which reported that the match had been cancelled as a result of a "pitch invasion in which many fans were injured". This article was presumably published before there were any reports that people had been killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/is-it-time-to-forgive-and-forget-kelvin-mackenzie-and-the-sun-over-the-lies-they-told-about-hillsborough-8190107.html|title=Is it time to forgive and forget Kelvin Mackenzie and the Sun over the lies they told about Hillsborough?|first=Ian |last=Herbert|date=28 September 2012|work=The Independent|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These media reports and others were examined during the 2012 Hillsborough Independent Panel report.&lt;ref name="Hillsborough Report Chapter 12"&gt;{{cite report|title=''The Truth''|url=http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/report/main-section/part-2/chapter-12/page-3/index.html|accessdate=30 April 2016|publisher=Hillsborough Independent: Panel Disclosed Material and Report|page=3|chapter=Chapter 12: Behind the headlines: the origins, promotion and reproduction of unsubstantiated allegations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''The Sun'' ====
[[File:Hillsborough disaster Sun.jpg|thumb|upright|The false allegations on the front page of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' on 19 April 1989]]
On 19 April, four days after the disaster, [[Kelvin MacKenzie]], editor of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', ordered "The Truth" as the front-page headline, followed by three sub-headlines: "Some fans picked pockets of victims", "Some fans urinated on the brave cops" and "Some fans beat up PC giving [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation|kiss of life]]". Mackenzie reportedly spent two hours deciding on which headline to run; his original instinct being for "You Scum" before eventually deciding on "The Truth".&lt;ref name="scraton 118"&gt;Scraton (1999), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As MacKenzie's layout was seen by more and more people, a collective shudder ran through the office (but) MacKenzie's dominance was so total there was nobody left in the organisation who could rein him in except Murdoch. (Everyone in the office) seemed paralysed—"looking like rabbits in the headlights"—as one hack described them. The error staring them in the face was too glaring. It obviously wasn't a silly mistake; nor was it a simple oversight. Nobody really had any comment on it—they just took one look and went away shaking their heads in wonder at the enormity of it. It was a 'classic smear'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After ''The Sun''{{'}}s report, the newspaper was boycotted by most newsagents in Liverpool and many readers cancelled their orders and refused to buy it from newsagents; and from then afterwards many in Liverpool refer to ''The Sun'' newspaper as ''The Scum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/18/hillsborough-anniversary-sun-newspaper|title=Hillsborough: 20 years on, Liverpool has still not forgiven the newspaper it calls 'The Scum'|first1=Owen|last1=Gibson|first2=Helen|last2=Carter|date=17 April 2009|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some even refuse to say the name or spell it as ''The S*n.''

MacKenzie explained his actions in 1993. Talking to a House of Commons National Heritage [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]], he said: "I regret Hillsborough. It was a fundamental mistake. The mistake was I believed what an [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] said. It was a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory]] MP.

''The Sun'' apologised for its treatment of the Hillsborough disaster "without reservation" in a full page [[Editorial|opinion piece]] on 7 July 2004, saying it had "committed the most terrible mistake in its history" by publishing it. The apology angered some Liverpudlians further. The ''Liverpool Echo'' called the apology, "shabby" and "an attempt, once again, to exploit the Hillsborough dead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Sun has lost the plot again|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sun-lost-plot-again-3541732|accessdate=26 April 2016|work=The Liverpool Echo|date=7 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September 2012, after the publication of the report exonerating the Liverpool fans, MacKenzie issued the following statement:
{{quote|Today I offer my profuse apologies to the people of Liverpool for that headline. I too was totally misled. Twenty-three years ago I was handed a piece of copy from a reputable news agency in Sheffield, in which a senior police officer and a senior local MP were making serious allegations against fans in the stadium. I had absolutely no reason to believe that these authority figures would lie and deceive over such a disaster. As the prime minister has made clear, these allegations were wholly untrue and were part of a concerted plot by police officers to discredit the supporters thereby shifting the blame for the tragedy from themselves. It has taken more than two decades, 400,000 documents and a two-year inquiry to discover to my horror that it would have been far more accurate had I written the headline The Lies rather than The Truth. I published in good faith and I am sorry that it was so wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19569749|title=Hillsborough files: Reaction to release of government papers|date=13 September 2012|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response, Trevor Hicks, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, rejected MacKenzie's apology as "too little, too late", calling him "[[Low-life|lowlife]], clever lowlife, but lowlife".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9538782/Hillsborough-Kelvin-MacKenzie-offers-profuse-apologies-to-the-people-of-Liverpool.html |title=Hillsborough: Kelvin MacKenzie offers 'profuse apologies to the people of Liverpool' |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=12 September 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A press conference held by families of the victims also banned all ''Sun'' reporters from entering, with a sign on the door reading "NO ENTRY TO SUN JOURNALISTS".&lt;ref name=AllegrettiHarris/&gt; Sales of ''The Sun'' remain poor in Merseyside and a boycott is still practised.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9540181/Hillsborough-The-Sun-profoundly-sorry-over-false-fan-conduct-reports.html "Hillsborough: The Sun 'profoundly sorry' over false fan conduct reports"], ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London), 13 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, its average circulation in Liverpool was 12,000 copies a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Burrell |first=Ian |title=An own goal?

Following the April 2016 verdict of unlawful killing, ''The Sun'' and the first print edition of the ''Times'' (both owned by [[News UK|News International]]), did not cover the stories on their front pages, with ''The Sun'' relegating the story to pages 8 and 9. An apology appeared on page 10, reiterating previous statements that the 1989 headline had been an error of judgement.&lt;ref name="Sommers27April" /&gt;

====''The Times''====
The journalist [[Edward Pearce (journalist)|Edward Pearce]] was criticised for writing a controversial article in the aftermath of the disaster, at a time when a number of victims' funerals were taking place. His column in ''The Sunday Times'' on 23 April 1989, included the text:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"For the second time in half a decade a large body of Liverpool supporters has killed people ... the shrine in the Anfield goalmouth, the cursing of the police, all the theatricals, come sweetly to a city which is already the world capital of self-pity. There are soapy politicians to make a pet of Liverpool, and Liverpool itself is always standing by to make a pet of itself. 'Why us? Why are we treated like animals?' To which the plain answer is that a good and sufficient minority of you behave like animals."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=moYLgQT35G0C&amp;lpg=PA67 ''Pies and Prejudice: In Search of the North''], Stuart Maconie, Random House, 2008, page 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pearce went on reflect that if South Yorkshire Police bore any responsibility, it was "for not realising what brutes they had to handle."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=20CfjILnQ9cC&amp;lpg=PA180 ''Liverpool – Wondrous Place: From the Cavern to the Capital of Culture''], Paul Du Noyer
Random House, 2012, page 180&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Phil Scraton described Pearce's comments as amongst the "most bigoted and factually inaccurate" published in the wake of the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;"No Last Rites: The Denial of Justice and The Promotion of Myth in The Aftermath of The Hillsborough Disaster;" Scraton et al., 1995&lt;/ref&gt; A number of complaints were made to the [[Press Council (UK)|Press Council]] concerning the article, but the Council ruled that it was unable to adjudicate on comment pieces, though the Council noted that tragedy or disaster is not an occasion for writers to exercise gratuitous provocation.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/docs/HOM000003280001.pdf Hillsborough Inquiry" Press Commission], 30 July 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 2016, ''[[The Times|Times]]'' staffers in the sports department expressed their outrage over the paper's decision to cover 26 April inquest, which ruled that the 96 dead were unlawfully killed, only on an inside spread and the sports pages, with some in the newspaper claiming there was a "mutiny" in the sports department.&lt;ref name="Martinson 27 April 16"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martinson|first1=Jane|title=Times front page omitting Hillsborough changed after staff revolt|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/27/times-hillsborough-protest-front-page-twitter|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=The Guardian|date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' later tweeted that "We made a mistake with the front page of our first edition, and we fixed it for our second edition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=TheTimes|number=725286275817836545 |date=27 April 2016 |title= We've been criticised today for not having Hillsborough on our first edition front page.

==== ''FHM'' ====
The November 2002 edition of the men's lifestyle magazine ''[[FHM]]'' in Australia was swiftly withdrawn from sale soon after its publication, and a public apology made in the Australian and British editions, because it contained jokes mocking the disaster.&lt;ref name="brandrepublic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/161663/FHM-Australia-pulled-Hillsborough-comments/ |title=FHM Australia, pulled after Hillsborough comments |work=Brand Republic |date=22 October 2002 |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Emap]] Australia, who owned ''FHM'' at the time, pledged to make a donation to the families of the victims.&lt;ref name="pressgazette"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=21703&amp;sectioncode=1 |title=FHM faces a boycott after Hillsborough 'joke' |work=Press Gazette |date=25 October 2002 |accessdate=7 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616185839/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=21703&amp;sectioncode=1 |archivedate=16 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original apology was not printed in the magazine as it was not considered "serious enough",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Byrne|first1=Ciar|title=FHM bungles Hillsborough apology|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/oct/28/pressandpublishing|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=The Guardian|date=28 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; its Australian editor, Geoff Campbell, released a statement: "We deeply regret the photograph captions published in the November issue of the Australian edition of ''FHM'', accompanying an article about the Hillsborough disaster of 1989. The right course of action is to withdraw this edition from sale – which we will be doing. We have been in contact with the Hillsborough Family Support Group and the Hillsborough Justice Campaign to express our deep regret and sincere apologies."&lt;ref name="brandrepublic" /&gt; The British edition disassociated itself from the controversy, stating: "''FHM'' Australia has its own editorial team and these captions were written and published without consultation with the UK edition, or any other edition of ''FHM''."&lt;ref name="pressgazette"/&gt;

The vice-chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Philip Hammond, said he wanted all football fans to boycott the magazine, saying, "I am going to write to every fanzine in the country – including Liverpool F.C.'s – telling them to ban ''FHM.'' People are very upset by it. I think there will be a real boycott." He added it would be like making jokes about the [[2002 Bali bombings]], in which eight fewer Australians were killed. The publication was finally discontinued in 2016, for unrelated reasons.&lt;ref name="pressgazette" /&gt;

==== ''The Spectator'' ====
''[[The Spectator]]'' was criticised for an editorial which appeared in the magazine on 16 October 2004 following the death of British hostage [[Kenneth Bigley|Kenneth John "Ken" Bigley]] in Iraq, in which it was claimed that the response to Bigley's killing was fuelled by the fact he was from Liverpool, and went on to criticise the "drunken" fans at Hillsborough and call on them to accept responsibility for their "role" in the disaster:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The extreme reaction to Mr Bigley's murder is fed by the fact that he was a Liverpudlian. Liverpool is a handsome city with a tribal sense of community. A combination of economic misfortune—its docks were, fundamentally, on the wrong side of England when Britain entered what is now the European Union—and an excessive predilection for welfarism have created a peculiar, and deeply unattractive, psyche among many Liverpudlians. They see themselves whenever possible as victims, and resent their victim status; yet at the same time they wallow in it. Part of this flawed psychological state is that they cannot accept that they might have made any contribution to their misfortunes, but seek rather to blame someone else for it, thereby deepening their sense of shared tribal grievance against the rest of society. The deaths of more than 50 Liverpool football supporters at Hillsborough in 1989 was undeniably a greater tragedy than the single death, however horrible, of Mr Bigley; but that is no excuse for Liverpool's failure to acknowledge, even to this day, the part played in the disaster by drunken fans at the back of the crowd who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground that Saturday afternoon. The police became a convenient scapegoat, and the ''Sun'' newspaper a whipping-boy for daring, albeit in a tasteless fashion, to hint at the wider causes of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Bigley's fate |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2004/10/bigleys-fate/ |magazine=The Spectator |location=London |publisher=Press Holdings |date=16 October 2004 |access-date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the then-editor [[Boris Johnson]] did not write this piece,&lt;ref name=indy100&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doré|first1=Louis|title=The truth about that awful Boris Johnson 'quote' on Hillsborough|url=http://indy100.independent.co.uk/article/the-truth-about-that-awful-alleged-boris-johnson-quote-on-hillsborough--Z1SY2Me2WW|accessdate=29 April 2016|work=indy100|date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; journalist [[Simon Heffer]] alleged he had written the first draft of the article "at Mr Johnson's request", and offered to apologise for its publication after it attracted "a furore in the city [of Liverpool]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heffer|first1=Simon|title=Profoundly flawed, but that won't stop Teflon Boris's bid for Dave's job|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2180025/Profoundly-flawed-won-t-stop-Teflon-Boris-s-bid-Dave-s-job.html|accessdate=29 April 2016|work=Daily Mail|date=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson apologised at the time of the article, travelling to Liverpool to do so,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Hillsborough: Boris Johnson apologises for slurs in 2004 Spectator article |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/hillsborough-boris-johnson-apologises-slurs-3334849 |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=13 September 2012 |access-date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again following the publication of the report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel in 2012; however, Johnson's apology was rejected by Margaret Aspinall, chairperson of the Hillsborough Families Support Group, whose son James, 18, died in the disaster:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What he has got to understand is that we were speaking the truth for 23 years and apologies have only started to come today from them because of yesterday. It's too little, too late. It's fine to apologise afterwards. They just don't want their names in any more sleaze. No, his apology doesn't mean a thing to me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Hillsborough papers: Boris Johnson apologises over article |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19589039 |publisher=BBC News |date=13 September 2012 |access-date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Spectator''{{'s}} comments were widely circulated following the April 2016 verdict by the Hillsborough inquest's second hearing proving [[unlawful killing]] of the 96 dead at Hillsborough.&lt;ref name=indy100 /&gt;

===''EastEnders''===
In November 2007, the BBC soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' caused controversy when the character [[Minty Peterson]] (played by [[Cliff Parisi]]) made a reference to the disaster. During the episode car mechanic Minty said: "Five years out of Europe because of Heysel, because they penned you lot in to stop you fighting on the pitch and then what did we end up with? Hillsborough." This prompted 380 complaints and the BBC apologised, saying that the character was simply reminding another character, former football hooligan [[Jase Dyer]], that the actions of hooligans led to the fencing-in of football fans. [[Ofcom]] also received 177 complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/nov/16/bbc.television1 |title=EastEnders attracts 1,000 complaints |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=16 November 2007 |accessdate=18 November 2007 |first=Caitlin |last=Fitzsimmons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Itandje===
Liverpool goalkeeper [[Charles Itandje]] was accused of having shown disrespect towards the Hillsborough victims during the 2009 remembrance ceremony, as he was spotted on camera "smiling and nudging" teammate [[Damien Plessis]]. He was suspended from the club for a fortnight and many fans felt he should not play for the club again. He was omitted from the first team squad and never played for the club in any capacity again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/8005039.stm |title=Club probes Hillsborough 'insult' |publisher=BBC News |date=18 April 2009 |accessdate=19 April 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jeremy Hunt===
On 28 June 2010, following England's departure from the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] competition in South Africa, the UK's Culture and Sport Secretary [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]] praised the England fans for their behaviour during the competition, saying "I mean, not a single arrest for a football-related offence, and the terrible problems that we had in Heysel and Hillsborough in the 1980s seem now to be behind us." He later apologised and said "I know that fan unrest played no part in the terrible events of April 1989 and I apologise to Liverpool fans and the families of those killed and injured in the Hillsborough disaster if my comments caused any offence." Margaret Aspinall, chairperson of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, asked for a face to face meeting with Hunt before deciding if she would accept the apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/10434714.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Apology over Hillsborough claims |date=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fans' chants===
Fans of rival football clubs such as Manchester United&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/170378.html|title=United fans want to end Hillsborough chants|publisher=ESPN|date=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been known to mention the Hillsborough disaster at fixtures{{efn |name=fixture}} to upset Liverpool fans. Following the findings of the Independent Panel in September 2012, [[Alex Ferguson]] and two Manchester United fan groups called for an end to the "sick chants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United fan groups want end to sick chants |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19666181 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leeds United chairman [[Ken Bates]] endorsed this call in the club programme and stated, "Leeds have suffered at times [[2000 UEFA Cup semi-final violence|with reference to Galatasaray]]; some of our so-called fans have also been guilty as well, particularly in relation to [[Munich air disaster|Munich]]." This is a reference to the deaths of eight Manchester United players in the Munich air disaster of 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Leeds United v Hull City official matchday programme|publisher=Leeds United A.F.C.|first=Ken|last=Bates|authorlink=Ken Bates|date=18 September 2012|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oliver Popplewell===
In October 2011, [[Oliver Popplewell|Sir Oliver Popplewell]], who chaired the public inquiry into the 1985 Bradford City stadium fire at [[Valley Parade]] that killed 56 people, called on the families of the Hillsborough victims to look at the "quiet dignity and great courage relatives in the West Yorkshire city had shown in the years following the tragedy". He said: "The citizens of Bradford behaved with quiet dignity and great courage. They did not harbour conspiracy theories. They did not seek endless further inquiries. They buried their dead, comforted the bereaved and succoured the injured. They organised a sensible compensation scheme and moved on. Is there, perhaps, a lesson there for the Hillsborough campaigners?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hillsborough disaster: Sir Oliver Popplewell outrages campaigners with comments|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/8835870/Hillsborough-disaster-Sir-Oliver-Popplewell-outrages-campaigners-with-comments.html|date=19 October 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=31 October 2012|first=Matthew|last=Holehouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popplewell was criticised for the comments, including a rebuke from a survivor of the Bradford fire. Labour MP [[Steve Rotheram]], commented: "How insensitive does somebody have to be to write that load of drivel?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former judge tells Hillsborough families to drop 'conspiracy theories'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/oct/19/judge-hillsborough-families-conspiracy-theories|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=19 October 2011 |agency=Press Association|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Crompton===

A formal complaint was made against David Crompton, South Yorkshire's chief constable, over internal emails relating to the Hillsborough disaster. In 2013 Crompton sent an email in which he said the families' "version of certain events has become 'the truth' even though it isn't". In September, David Crompton had emailed the force's assistant chief constable Andy Holt and head of media Mark Thompson on 8 September, just four days before the Hillsborough Independent Panel Report was published. The email came to light as the result of a Freedom of Information request. South Yorkshire's police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright has appointed chief constable Simon Parr of Cambridgeshire Constabulary to head the investigation. Wright said: "The request has been submitted by a firm of solicitors in Liverpool acting on behalf of a number of individuals affected by the event."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-22910241 |publisher=BBC News |title=Hillsborough disaster: Probe into South Yorkshire police email |date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, Crompton announced that he would retire in November. On 26 April 2016, after the inquest jury delivered a verdict affirming all the charges against the police, Crompton "unequivocally accepted" the verdicts, including unlawful killing, said that the police operation at the stadium on the day of the disaster had been "catastrophically wrong", and apologised unreservedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Joe|title=Hillsborough disaster inquests verdict finds Liverpool fans unlawfully killed|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/hillsborough-verdict-finds-liverpool-fans-11243132|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=27 April 2016|date=26 April 2016|quote=The jury at the inquests today delivered a set of damning verdicts placing the responsibility for the disaster directly in the hands of the police, ambulance service and structural engineers who worked on the Leppings Lane end.

===Civil servant===
{{main|Hillsborough Wikipedia posts}}
In June 2014, an unnamed 24-year-old British civil servant was sacked for posting offensive comments about the disaster on Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/17/civil-servant-sacked-wikipedia-edits-hillsborough |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Civil servant sacked for offensive Wikipedia edits on Hillsborough |first=Mark | last=Tran |date=17 June 2014 |accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steven Cohen===

In 2009, nearly twenty years to the day after the disaster, [[Steven Cohen (soccer)|Steven Cohen]], a presenter on Fox Soccer Channel and Sirius satellite radio in the United States (an Englishman and Chelsea fan), stated on his radio show that Liverpool fans "without tickets" were the "root cause" and "perpetrators" of the disaster. A boycott of advertisers by American Liverpool fans eventually brought about an apology from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/q038a-foxs-steven-cohen-on-the-advertiser-boycott-over-his-remarks-on-soccer-stadium-deaths/|title=Q&amp;A: Fox's Steven Cohen on the Advertiser Boycott Over His Remarks on Soccer Stadium Deaths|date=24 June 2009|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldsoccertalk.com/2009/05/18/steven-cohen-apologizes-for-inaccurate-hillsborough-claims/|title=Steven Cohen Apologizes For Inaccurate Hillsborough Claims|work=World Soccer Talk|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this he was replaced as presenter of Fox Football Fone-in.

===Bernard Ingham===

In 1996, [[Bernard Ingham|Sir Bernard Ingham]], former press secretary to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, caused controversy with his comments about the disaster. In a letter addressed to a victim's parent, Ingham wrote that the disaster was caused by "tanked up yobs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2013/01/17/hillsborough-mum-tells-of-sir-bernard-ingham-s-hurtful-letters-100252-32617713 |title=Hillsborough mum tells of Sir Bernard Ingham's "hurtful" letters |first=David |last=Bartlett |date=17 January 2013 |accessdate=26 April 2013 |newspaper=Liverpool Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another letter written to a Liverpool supporter, also written in 1996, Ingham remarked that people should "shut up about Hillsborough".&lt;ref name=BelfestTelegraphHillsborough&gt;{{cite news|title=Bernard Ingham, who called Liverpool fans 'tanked up yobs', still refuses to apologise to Hillsborough families despite inquest findings|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/bernard-ingham-who-called-liverpool-fans-tanked-up-yobs-still-refuses-to-apologise-to-hillsborough-families-despite-inquest-findings-34661783.html|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=The Belfast Telegraph|date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LiverpoolEchoHillsborough"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bagot|first1=Martin|title=Ingham STILL refuses to say sorry for blaming Liverpool fans over Hillsborough|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/bernard-ingham-still-refuses-say-11244412|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=Liverpool Echo|date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of the inquest verdict, Ingham refused to apologise or respond to the previous comments he made, telling a reporter, "I have nothing to say."&lt;ref name=BelfestTelegraphHillsborough /&gt;&lt;ref name="LiverpoolEchoHillsborough" /&gt; There have since been calls to have Ingham stripped of his knighthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Belger|first1=Tom|title=Petition to strip Bernard Ingham of his knighthood for blaming fans|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/bernard-ingham-hillsborough-thatcher-blame-11252213|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=Liverpool Echo|date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topman===
In March 2018, British clothing retailer [[Topman]] marketed a T-shirt which was interpreted by members of the public, including relatives of Hillsborough victims, as mocking the disaster. The T-shirt was red with white details like a Liverpool shirt, and had the number 96 on the back like a football shirt, with the text "Karma" and "What goes around comes back around", and a white rose, as associated with Yorkshire. Topman stated that the T-shirt was in reference to a Bob Marley [[Bob Marley and the Wailers discography#1990s|song re-released in 1996]] and apologised and withdrew the item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Joe|title=Why the people of Liverpool are totally justified in holding Topman to account|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/people-liverpool-totally-justified-holding-14421408|accessdate=16 March 2018|work=Liverpool Echo|date=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio, television and theatre==

===1989: ''After Dark''===

On 20 May 1989, a week after the disaster, [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'' programme broadcast a live discussion ''[[After Dark (TV series)#Hillsborough and "Football – The Final Whistle?"|Football – The Final Whistle?]]'' Bereaved parent Eileen Delaney was a guest, along with her husband James. Extracts from what she said can be read [http://www.contrast.org/hillsborough/history/gym.shtm here] and in ''Hillsborough – The Truth'' by Phil Scraton (Mainstream Publishing 2016).

===1996 drama===
{{main|Hillsborough (1996 film)}}
A television drama film, based on the disaster and subsequent events, titled simply [[Hillsborough (1996 film)|''Hillsborough'']], was produced by [[Granada Television]]. It was highly praised and won the BAFTA Award for Best Single Drama in 1997. [[Christopher Eccleston]], Ricky Tomlinson and [[Mark Womack (British actor)|Mark Womack]] were among the cast of the film. It was aired for the first time in 1996, and has been aired four times since then, in 1998, 2009, in September 2012 on the weekend following the release of the findings of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, and again on 1 May 2016 on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/granada/update/2016-05-01/1996-hillsborough-drama-repeated-on-itv-tonight-at-10-20pm/|title=Hillsborough Drama Shown Again on ITV Tonight at 10:20&amp;nbsp;pm|publisher=itv.com|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 ''The Reunion''===

In 2009 BBC Radio 4 transmitted "The Reunion": on the 20th anniversary Sue MacGregor brought together a group of people who were involved in the disaster to talk about the events of that day at a time when they were still in the midst of their fight for justice. This programme was repeated at the end of the week in which the Hillsborough inquest found that the 96 Liverpool football died unlawfully. The programme can be heard [https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00jlxjp here].

===2014/2016 documentary===
{{main|Hillsborough (2014 documentary)}}
The American sports network [[ESPN]], as part of its ''[[30 for 30]]'' series of sports films (under a new "Soccer Stories" subdivision), aired the documentary ''[[Hillsborough (2016 documentary)|Hillsborough]]'' as a co-production with the BBC. Directed by [[Daniel Gordon (film director)|Daniel Gordon]], the 2-hour film chronicles the disaster, the investigations, and their lingering effects; it also included interviews with survivors, victims' relatives, police officers and investigators. ''Hillsborough'' aired the first time on 15 April 2014, the 25th anniversary of the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=hillsborough Web page for ''30 for 30'': ''Hillsborough'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/arts/television/30-for-30-soccer-stories-on-espn-revisits-hillsborough.html|title=When a game turned into a disaster|newspaper=The New York Times|date= 14 April 2014|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary was unable to be shown in Great Britain upon initial release due to the 2012 High Court inquest still being in progress.

===Stage plays===
Two British stage plays also dealt with the disaster with different view points:
* [[Jonathan Harvey (playwright)|Jonathan Harvey]]'s ''Guiding Star'' showed a father coming to terms with what had happened some years later.
* [[Lance Nielsen]] wrote ''Waiting For Hillsborough'' about two Liverpool families waiting for news of their missing loved ones on the day, which leads to discussion of football safety and the culture of blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonscreenwritersfestival.com/speakers/lance-nielsen|title=Speakers – Lance Nielsen |work=[[London Screenwriters' Festival]]|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nielsen's play won him an award at the 1999 Liverpool Arts and Entertainment awards and was highly praised by the Liverpool press.

'''Hungry ghost''' is a concept in [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[Chinese traditional religion]] representing  beings who are driven by intense emotional needs in an [[Animals in Buddhism|animalistic]] way.
The term  {{lang|zh|[[:wikt:餓鬼|餓鬼]]}} ''{{lang|pny|èguǐ}}'', literally "'''hungry ghost'''", is the Chinese translation of the term ''[[preta]]'' in [[Buddhism]].
"Hungry ghosts" play a role in [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]] as well as in [[Chinese folk religion]].
The term is not to be confused with the generic term for "[[Ghosts in Chinese culture|ghost]]", {{lang|zh|[[:wikt:鬼|鬼]]}} ''{{lang|pny|guǐ}}'' (i.e. the spirit of a deceased ancestor). The understanding is that all people become such a regular ghost when they die,&lt;ref name="sixteen"&gt;Venerable Yin-shun. ''The Way to Buddhahood''. Massachusetts: Wisdom Publications: 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and would then slowly weaken and eventually die a second time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfnn.org/book/article2/1323.htm 目次：冥報記白話]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eleven"&gt;Eberhard, Stephen F. ''The Ghost Festival in Medieval China''. New Jersey: Princeton University Press: 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Hungry ghosts, by contrast, are a much more exceptional case, and would only occur in very unfortunate circumstances, such as if a whole family were killed or when a family no longer venerated their ancestors.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

With the rise in popularity of [[Buddhism]], the idea became popular that [[soul]]s would live in space until reincarnation.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt; In the [[Taoism|Taoist]] tradition it is believed that hungry ghosts can arise from people whose deaths have been violent or unhappy. Both Buddhism&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt; and Taoism&lt;ref name="fourteen"&gt;Oldstone-Moore, Jennifer. ''Taoism''. USA: Oxford University Press: 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; share the idea that hungry ghosts can emerge from neglect or desertion of ancestors. According to the [[Flower Garland Sutra|Hua-yen Sutra]] evil deeds will cause a soul to be reborn in one of six different realms.&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;Baroni, Helen J. Ph.D. ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism''. New York: The Rosen Publishing Group, Incorporated: 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest degree of evil deed will cause a soul to be reborn as a denizen of [[Diyu|hell]], a lower degree of evil will cause a soul to be reborn as an animal, and the lowest degree will cause a soul to be reborn as a hungry ghost.&lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;Gregory, Peter N., ed. ''Inquiry Into the Origin of Humanity''. Hawaii: University of Hawaii Press: 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the tradition, evil deeds that lead to becoming a hungry ghost are killing, stealing and sexual misconduct. Desire, greed, anger and ignorance are all factors in causing a soul to be reborn as a hungry ghost because they are motives for people to perform evil deeds.&lt;ref name="sixteen" /&gt;

==Myths of origin ==
[[File:Hungry Ghosts Scroll Kyoto 2.jpg|right|thumb|500px|Image from a Japanese scroll which describes the realm of the hungry ghosts and how to placate them. Currently housed at the [[Kyoto National Museum]], artist unknown.]]
There are many legends regarding the origin of hungry ghosts. In the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition there are stories from ''Chuan-chi po-yuan ching'' ("Sutra of One Hundred Selected Legends") that is from the early third century.&lt;ref name="fifteen"&gt;Eberhardt, Wolfram. ''Chinese Festivals''. New York: Abelard-Schuman Ltd.: 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of these stories are as follows:

One story is of a rich man who traveled selling [[sugar-cane]] juice. One day a [[Buddhist monk|monk]] came to his house looking for some juice to cure an illness. The man had to leave, so he instructed his wife to give the monk the drink in his absence. Instead of doing this, she secretly urinated in the monk's bowl, added sugar cane juice to it and gave it to the monk. The monk was not deceived, he poured out the bowl and left. When the wife died she was reborn as a hungry ghost.&lt;ref name="fifteen" /&gt;

Another such tale is of a man who was giving and kind. One day he was about to leave his house when a monk came by begging. The man instructed his wife to give the monk some food. After the man left his house his wife was overcome with greed. She took it upon herself to teach the monk a lesson, so she locked the monk in an empty room all day with no food. She was reborn as a hungry ghost for innumerable lifetimes.&lt;ref name="fifteen" /&gt;

Most times the legends speak of hungry ghosts who in a previous lifetime were greedy women who refused to give away food.&lt;ref name="fifteen" /&gt; Other stories in the Buddhist tradition come from ''Kuei wen mu-lien ching'' ("The Sutra on the Ghosts Questioning Mu-lien"). One of the stories tells of a man who was a diviner who constantly misled people due to his own avarice and is now a hungry ghost.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt; There is another story in "The Legend of Mu-lien Entering the City and Seeing Five Hundred Hungry Ghosts". The story is about five hundred men that were sons of elders of the city they lived in. When monks came begging to the city for food, the sons denied them because they thought the monks would keep coming back and eventually take all their food. After the sons died they were reborn as hungry ghosts.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

==Celebrations and practices ==
[[File:Ghost Festival in Ping Chou.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Offerings are prepared for hungry ghosts during [[Ghost Festival|Ghost month]] in [[Hong Kong]].]]
{{see also|Ghost Festival}}
In Chinese [[ancestor worship]]  鬼法界, 鬼界 is "the realm of hungry ghosts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://buddhism-dict.net/ddb/indexes/term-en.html Buddhism-dict.net] (accessed: October 18, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; There is a belief of the [[oral tradition]] of Chinese villagers that the ghosts of the ancestors may be granted permission to return to the world of the living at a certain time of the year, hungry and ready to take what they can from there, if these spirits had not been given sufficient offerings by their living relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Martin | first = Emily | author2 = Emíly M. Ahern | title = The cult of the dead in a Chinese village| publisher = Stanford University Press | year = 1973 | pages = | isbn =9780804708357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[festival]] called the [[Ghost Festival|Hungry Ghost Festival]] (TC: 盂蘭盆, SC: 盂兰盆 Yúlánpén) is held to honor the hungry ancestor ghosts and food and drink is put out to satisfy their needs.
The Hungry Ghost Festival is celebrated during the 7th month of the [[Chinese calendar]]. It also falls at the same time as a full moon, the new season, the fall harvest, the peak of monastic asceticism, the rebirth of ancestors, and the assembly of the local community.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;[[Stephen F. Teiser]]. ''The Ghost Festival in Medieval China''. Princeton University Press, 1996 .&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, during this month, the gates of [[Diyu|hell]] are opened up and the hungry ghosts are free to roam the earth where they seek food and entertainment.  These ghosts are believed to be ancestors of those who have forgotten to pay tribute to them after they died. They have long thin necks because they have not been fed by their families. Tradition states that families should offer prayers to their deceased relatives and burn "[[hell money]]". It is believed that "hell money" is a valid currency in the underworld and helps ghosts to live comfortably in the afterlife. People also burn other forms of [[joss paper]] such as paper houses, cars and televisions to please the ghosts.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;"Hungry Ghost Festival". Essortment, 2002. Retrieved Oct 20, 2008. [http://www.essortment.com/all/hungryghostfes_opi.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

Families also pay tribute to other unknown wandering ghosts so that these homeless souls do not intrude on their lives and bring misfortune.  A big feast is held for the ghosts on the 15th day of the 7th month, where people bring samples of food and place them on the offering table to please the ghosts and ward off bad luck. Live shows are also put on and everyone is invited to attend. The first row of seats is always empty as this is where the ghosts are supposed to sit to better enjoy the live entertainment. The shows are always put on at night and at high volumes, so that the sound attracts and pleases the ghosts.&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;[http://www.chinese-culture.net/html/hungry_ghost_festival.html "Chinese Culture: Hungry Ghost Festival"]&lt;/ref&gt;  These acts were better known as "Merry-making".&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;"Ghost Festival" ChinaVoc 2001-2007 , {{cite web |url=http://www.chinavoc.com/festivals/ghost.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608143719/http://www.chinavoc.com/festivals/ghost.htm |archivedate=2009-06-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief [[Taoism|Taoist]] priest of the town wears an ornate crown of five gold and red panels, a practice borrowed from [[Buddhism]]. This represented the five most powerful deities (The [[Jade Emperor]], [[Guan Yu]], [[Tu Di Gong]], [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]] and [[Xi Wangmu]]). He is believed to become their voice on earth.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

A sacrificial altar and a chair are built for a priest either at a street entrance or in front of the village. The [[Bodhisattva]] Ksitigarbha sits in front of the chair. Under the chair are plates of rice flour and peaches. Sitting on the altar are three spirit tablets and three funeral banners. After noon, sheep, pigs, chicken, fruits, and cakes are donated by families that are displayed on the altar. A priest will put a triangular paper banner of three colors with special characters on every sacrifice. After the music begins to play, the priest hits the bell to call the hungry ghosts back to the table. He then throws the rice and peaches into the air in all directions to distribute them to the ghosts.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

During the evening, [[incense]] is burnt in front of the doors of households. Incense stands for prosperity, the more incense burnt, the greater one's prosperity.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;  During the festival, shops are closed to leave the streets open for the ghosts. In the middle of each street stands an altar of incense with fresh fruit and sacrifices displayed on it. Behind the altar,  monks will sing songs that it is believed only the ghosts can understand. This rite is called ''shi ge'r'', meaning "singing ghost songs".&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

Fifteen days after the feast, to make sure all the hungry ghosts find their way back to [[Diyu|hell]], people float lanterns on water and set them outside their houses. These lanterns are made by setting a lotus flower-shaped lantern on a piece of board. Hungry ghosts are believed to have found their way back when the lanterns go out.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

==Types of spirits ==
{{see also|List of supernatural beings in Chinese folklore|Ghosts in Chinese culture#Types of ghosts}}

It is believed that the [[soul]] contains elements of both [[yin and yang]]. The yin is the ''[[Kui (Chinese mythology)|kui]]'', or demon part, and the yang is the ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'', or spirit part. When death occurs, the ''kui'' should return to earth, and the ''shen'' to the grave or family shrine. If a ghost is neglected, it will become a ''kui''. The ''shen'', or ancestral spirit watches over its descendants, and can bring good fortune if properly worshipped.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;"Zhongyua Festival - Hungry Ghost Festival". China Daily. 2004 Aug 30. Retrieved 2008 Oct 20. [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-08/30/content_370126.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hungry ghosts are different from the [[Ghosts in Chinese culture|ghosts of Chinese traditions]], which all people are believed to become after death. According to the [[Buddha Dharma]], there are three main groups of hungry ghosts: those with no wealth, those with a little and those with a lot.&lt;ref name="sixteen" /&gt;  Those with no wealth are broken into three groups: the torch or flaming mouths, in which food and drink become flames; the needle mouths, whose throats are so tiny that food cannot pass through; and the vile mouths, whose mouths are so decomposed and smelly that they cannot ingest anything. The ghosts with a little wealth are able to eat small amounts. The ghosts with great wealth also have three subgroups: the ghosts of sacrifices, who live off sacrifices offered by humans and are similar to spirits described in China; the ghosts of losses, who live off lost objects from the human world; and the ghosts of great powers, like ''[[yaksha]]s'' and ''[[rakshasa]]s'', who are the powerful rulers of ghosts. The ghosts of sacrifices and losses sometimes suffer from hunger and thirst, whereas the ghosts of great powers have pleasures close to those of divine beings. Among hungry ghosts, however, most have little or no wealth and are extremely hungry.

Sixteen hungry ghosts are said to live in [[Diyu|hell]] or in a region of hell. Unlike other hell dwellers, they can leave hell and wander. They look through garbage and human waste on the outskirts of human cities. They are said to be invisible during the daylight hours but visible at night. Some hungry ghosts can only eat corpses, or their food is burnt up in their mouths, sometimes they have a big belly and a neck as thin as a needle (this image is the basic one for hungry ghosts in [[Buddhism in Asia|Asian Buddhism]]).&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

==Folk beliefs and customs ==
[[File:GhostFestivalsMalaysia002.jpg|thumb|300px|A performance held during [[Ghost Festival|Ghost month]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]. People are not supposed to sit in the red chairs at the front because they are reserved for the "hungry ghosts."]]
There are many folk beliefs and taboos surrounding the [[Ghost Festival|Hungry Ghost Festival]]. Spirits are thought to be dangerous, and can take many forms, including snakes, moths, birds, foxes, wolves, and tigers. Some can even use the guise of a beautiful man or woman to seduce and possess. One story refers to a ghost which takes the form of a pretty girl and seduces a young man until a priest intervenes and sends the spirit back to hell. It is believed that [[Demonic possession|possession]] can cause illness and/or mental disorders.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

During the 7th month of the [[Chinese calendar]] children are advised (usually by an elder in the family) to be home before dark, and not to wander the streets at night for fear a ghost might possess them. Swimming is thought to be dangerous as well, as spirits are believed to have drowned people. People will generally avoid driving at night, for fear of a "collision", or spiritual offence, which is any event leading to illness or misfortune.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;DeBernardi, Jean Elizabeth, and Jean DeBernardi. ''Rites of Belonging: Memory, Moderninity &amp; Identity in a Malaysian Chinese Community''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  While "ghost" is a commonly used term throughout the year, many people use the phrase "backdoor god" or "good brother" instead during the 7th month, so as not to anger the ghosts.  Another thing to avoid is sampling any of the food placed on the offering table, as doing this can result in "mysterious illness".  Any person attending a show at indoor entertainment venues (''[[getai]]s'') will notice the first row of chairs is left empty. These seats are reserved for the spirits, and it is considered bad form to sit in them. After an [[Joss paper|offering]] has been burnt for the spirits, stepping on or near the burnt area should be avoided, as it is considered an "opening" to the spirit world and touching it may cause the person to be possessed.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The English term has often been used metaphorically to describe the insatiable craving of an addict.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Mark Epstein]] in '' Thoughts Without a Thinker'', pp. 29, 30, {{ISBN|0-465-08585-7}}, of the compulsive [[infidelity]] of a patient.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with Buddhism outside China==
The [[desire realm#Preta Realm|World of the Hungry Ghosts]] ''(preta)'' is one of the six domains of the [[desire realm]] of Buddhism.

===Tibetan Buddhism===
{{Main|Preta}}
In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] Hungry Ghosts (Tib. ཡི་དྭགས་, Wyl. yi dwags, {{lang-sa|[[pretas]]}}) have their own realm depicted on the [[Bhavacakra]] and are represented as teardrop or [[Paisley (design)|paisley]]-shaped with bloated stomachs and necks too thin to pass food such that attempting to eat is also incredibly painful. Some are described as having "mouths the size of a needle's eye and a stomach the size of a mountain". This is a metaphor for people futilely attempting to fulfill their illusory physical desires.

According to the [[History of Buddhism]], as elements of Chinese Buddhism entered a dialogue with Indian Buddhism in the [[Tibetan Plateau]], this synthesis is evident in the compassion rendered in the form of blessed remains of food, etc., offered to the ''pretas'' in rites such as [[Ganachakra]].  {{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion|date=December 2008}}

===Japanese Buddhism===
[[File:Hungry Ghosts Scroll Kyoto 1.tif|thumb|475px|Section of the Hungry Ghosts Scroll depicting one of the thirty-six types of hungry ghosts who constantly seeks water to drink and explaining how those who have been born as such are saved by the offerings of the living. Kyoto Museum]]
In [[Japanese Buddhism]], two such creatures{{Ambiguous|date=November 2016}} exist: the '''gaki''' and the '''[[jikininki]]'''.  Gaki (餓鬼) are the [[spiritual being|spirit]]s of [[jealousy|jealous]] or greedy people who, as punishment for their mortal vices, have been cursed with an insatiable hunger for a particular substance or object. Traditionally, this is something repugnant or humiliating, such as human [[corpse]]s or [[feces]], though in more recent legends, it may be virtually anything, no matter how bizarre. Jikininki (食人鬼 "people-eating ghosts") are the spirits of greedy, [[selfishness|selfish]] or [[impiety|impious]] individuals who are cursed after death to seek out and eat human corpses. They do this at night, scavenging for newly dead bodies and food offerings left for the dead. They sometimes also loot the corpses they eat for valuables. Nevertheless, jikininki lament their condition and hate their repugnant cravings for dead human flesh. {{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion|date=December 2008}}

The Hungry Ghosts Scroll kept at the [[Kyoto National Museum]] depicts the world of the hungry ghosts, the suffering of these creatures and contains tales of salvation of these ghosts. The whole scroll has been designated as National Treasure of Japan and it was possibly part of a set of scrolls depicting the six realms which was kept at [[Sanjūsangen-dō]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hungry_Ghosts_Scroll_Kyoto_1.tif Hungry Ghosts Scroll Kyoto 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The music and some of the lyrics for ''King Kong'' were written by [[Todd Matshikiza]]. The lyrics were by Pat Willams and the book by [[Harry Bloom]].&lt;ref&gt;Todd Matshikiza, Harry Bloom, &amp; Pat Williams, ''King Kong – The African Jazz Opera'', London: Collins, 1961. {{OCLC|2399779}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The musical was directed by Leon Gluckman with orchestration and arrangements by pianist Sol Klaaste, tenor saxophonist Mackay Davashe, alto saxophonist [[Kippie Moeketsi]] and composer [[Stanley Glasser]]. ''King Kong'' was choreographed by Arnold Dover.

The decor and costumes were designed by [[Arthur Goldreich]], a [[Jewish]] [[communist]] architect and [[visual designer]] (who was later arrested during an apartheid clampdown).

''King Kong'' had an all-black cast. The musical portrayed the life and times of a heavyweight boxer, [[Ezekiel Dlamini]], known as "King Kong". Born in 1921, after a meteoric boxing rise, his life degenerated into drunkenness and gang violence. He knifed his girlfriend, asked for the death sentence during his trial and instead was sentenced to 14 years' hard labour. He was found drowned in 1957 and it was believed his death was suicide. He was 36.

After being a hit in South Africa, touring for two years during which it was seen by more than a quarter of a million people, of whom two-thirds were white, the musical played at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre|Prince's Theatre]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] of [[London]] in 1961. The liner notes for the London cast recording state: "No theatrical venture in South Africa has had the sensational success of King Kong. This musical, capturing the life, colour, and effervescence -- as well as the poignancy and sadness -- of township life, has come as a revelation to many South Africans that art does not recognize racial barriers. King Kong has played to capacity houses in every major city in the Union [of South Africa], and now, the first export of indigenous South African theatre, it will reveal to the rest of the world the peculiar flavour of township life, as well as the hitherto unrecognized talents of its people. The show, as recorded here, opened at the Princes Theatre, London, on February 23, 1961."

The song "Sad Times, Bad Times" was considered a reference at the time to the infamous South African [[Treason Trial]] in [[Pretoria]], which had begun in 1956 and lasted for more than four years before it collapsed with all the accused acquitted. Among the defendants were [[Albert Luthuli]] ([[African National Congress]] president), secretary [[Walter Sisulu]], [[Oliver Tambo]] and [[Nelson Mandela]]. According to [[John Matshikiza]], ''King Kong''′s first night was attended by Mandela, who at the interval congratulated Todd Matshikiza "on weaving a subtle message of support for the Treason Trial leaders into the opening anthem".&lt;ref&gt;John Matshikiza, "An incomplete masterpiece" (5 February 1999), in Todd Matshikiza &amp; John Matshikiza, ''With the Lid Off: South African Insights from Home and Abroad 1959-2000'', Milpark: M&amp;G Books, 2000; pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Lewis Nkosi]] wrote: "The resounding welcome accorded to the musical at Wits University Great Hall, in Johannesburg, on Feb 2nd 1959, was not so much for the jazz musical as a finished artistic product as it was applause for an idea which had been achieved by pooling together resources from both black and white artists in the face of impossible odds."&lt;ref name=BBC3 /&gt;

==Cast==
''King Kong'' launched the international career of [[Miriam Makeba]], who played the [[shebeen]] queen of the Back of the Moon, a popular shebeen of the time in [[Sophiatown]].

The male lead was Nathan Mdledle of the [[Manhattan Brothers]]. There was a cast of 72, among them [[Caiphus Semenya]], [[Sophie Mgcina]], [[Letta Mbulu]] and [[Benjamin Masinga]].&lt;ref name=Maverick&gt;Marianne Thamm, [https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2017-01-10-king-kong-lives-again-iconic-1950s-musical-revival-set-to-be-highlight-on-sa-2017-cultural-calendar/#.WYjV5oTyvIU "King Kong lives again: Iconic 1950s musical revival set to be highlight on SA 2017 cultural calendar"], ''Daily Maverick'', 10 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''From the London cast recording liner notes (no indication of copyright):''

In the dim light of early morning the township people set out for work ("Sad Times, Bad Times"). As Pauline, the washerwoman, leaves to deliver a bundle of washing a boy picks out a tune on a penny whistle—the "Little Kong" song, which has become a great favourite with the children. This sets the group reminiscing about the life of King Kong, who has become something of a legend in the township. And so we see the great King Kong in his heyday, surrounded by photographers, journalists and an excited township crowd ("Marvelous Muscles"). There is a big fight coming off, and everybody is confident it will be a pushover for the Champ ("King Kong"). King wins the fight and takes his friends to celebrate in Back of the Moon, the township's most famous shebeen ("Kwela Kong").

Joyce, who is the "shebeen queen", falls for King ("Back of the Moon"). Their love affair goes off at a hot pace, which is unlucky for Petal, who has a secret passion for the prizefighter ("The Earth Turns Over"). It is also bad news for Lucky, the fast and fancy leader of the Prowlers gang, who had previously been Joyce's man. Later, Lucky and his gang corner Popcorn, King Kong's friend and second, and King and his crowd arrive just in time to save him. In the ensuing brawl, King kills one of the gangsters with his fists, and Lucky swears to get even with him ("Damn Him!").

King spends ten months in the cells awaiting trial and Joyce finds new male company. King's trainer, Jack, signs up a new heavyweight, and continues with his pursuit of Nurse Miriam Ngidi. With King out of the picture, the Prowlers have it all their own way in the township. Then one Sunday when the streets are full of people ("Gumboot Dance") King Kong returns home acquitted. Everybody is overjoyed to see him and although King's pleasure sours a little when he learns about the new heavyweight, he is reassured by the tribal welcome home given him by the whole township ("King King").

Act Two opens with children playing in the township streets. Popcorn warns the children against boxing and tells of trouble in King Kong's camp ("Be Smart, Be Wise"). Lights go out, the township turns in for the night, then suddenly—crash! It is another snatch and grab raid by the Prowlers. Things are going badly for King. With Lucky and his gang exerting pressure on any prospective opponents, he can get no proper fights. The best Jack can do is to sign him up with Greb Mabisa, a middleweight. Lucky lets this fight go, knowing it will make a fool of King. Meanwhile, the ex-champ has laid off training, is making no attempt to get fit, and has fallen out with Joyce. But she agrees to give King one more chance, on condition that he never hits another man outside the ring. In the atmosphere of reconciliation, Jack at last announces that he and Nurse Miriam Ngidi are getting married ("Quickly in Love").

King loses the fight against Greb. The township is incredulous, and King experiences the scorn and mockery of the early morning bus queue the day after the fight ("In the Queue"). Lucky and his gang taunt him unmercifully. Enraged, he hits at the people in the queue, and Joyce, in disgust, walks out on him forever.

The whole town comes to Jack and Miriam's wedding ("Wedding Hymn") and in the middle of the ceremony King arrives, demanding "Where's Joyce?" A few minutes later Joyce comes in with Lucky, and in that moment King sees not only his own downfall, but Joyce's tragic return to the tough life of the shebeen keeper and gangster's girl. In blind fury, he kills Joyce. At his trial, a showman and eccentric to the end, King dismisses his lawyer, pleads guilty and asks the judge to sentence him to death ("Death Song"). He is given fifteen years imprisonment, but two weeks later drowns himself in a dam at the farm prison to which he was committed. As the show ends, it is evening in the township yard and the people are streaming back from work.

'''''Kinky Boots''''' is a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Cyndi Lauper]] and a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]]. 

Based on the 2005 British film ''[[Kinky Boots (film)|Kinky Boots]]'', written by [[Geoff Deane]] and [[Tim Firth]] and inspired by true events, the musical tells the story of Charlie Price. Having inherited a shoe factory from his father, Charlie forms an unlikely partnership with cabaret performer and [[drag queen]] Lola to produce a line of [[Kinky boots|high-heeled boots]] and save the business. In the process, Charlie and Lola discover that they are not so different after all.

Following the show's conception in 2006, the creative team was assembled by 2010. The original production of ''Kinky Boots'' premiered at the [[Bank of America Theatre]] in [[Chicago]] in October 2012, with both direction and choreography by [[Jerry Mitchell]], and starring [[Stark Sands]] and [[Billy Porter (entertainer)|Billy Porter]] as Charlie and Lola, respectively. It made its [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut at the [[Al Hirschfeld Theatre]] on April 4, 2013, following previews that began on March 3, 2013. The musical began its US tour in 2014.

Having initially been less well received by theatre critics and at the box office than another 2013 Broadway production, ''[[Matilda the Musical]]'', ''Kinky Boots'' entered the 2013 awards season as an underdog. However, less than a month after opening, ''Kinky Boots'' surpassed this rival with audiences in weekly box office gross and later enjoyed a post-Tony boost in advance sales.  The production earned a season-high 13 nominations and 6 Tony wins, including [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]] and [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Score]] for Lauper in her first outing as a Broadway songwriter, making her the first woman to win alone in that category. The musical's cast album premiered at number one on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] Cast Albums Chart and number fifty-one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. In 2016, it won three [[Laurence Olivier Awards]], including [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical|Best New Musical]].

==Synopsis==

===Act I===

Charlie Price grows up as the fourth-generation "son" in his family business, Price &amp; Son, a shoe factory in [[Northampton]]. Another young boy, growing up in [[London]], is as fascinated by shoes as Charlie is bored by them, but in this case, it is a pair of red women's heels that have attracted his attention, aggravating his strict father. Years pass. Charlie's father is aging and hopes that Charlie will take over the factory, but Charlie is eager to move to London with his status-conscious fiancée, Nicola, and pursue a career in real estate ("The Most Beautiful Thing").

Charlie has barely made it into his new flat in London when his father dies suddenly. Charlie hurries home for the funeral, where he finds the factory near bankruptcy. The factory makes good quality men's shoes, but they are not stylish and not cheap, and the market for them is drying up. Charlie is determined to save the factory and his father's legacy, though he has no desire to run Price &amp; Sons himself. The workers, many of whom have known Charlie his entire life, do not understand why Charlie had moved away in the first place, and many are hostile and skeptical of the new management.

Returning to London, Charlie meets his friend and fellow shoe salesman Harry, in a pub, to ask for help with the factory. Harry can only offer a temporary solution and advises Charlie not to fight the inevitable ("Take What You Got"). Leaving the pub, Charlie witnesses a woman being accosted by two drunks. He intervenes and is knocked unconscious. He comes to in a seedy nightclub, where the woman he attempted to rescue is revealed to have been the club's [[drag queen]] headliner, Lola, who performs with her backup troupe of drag dancers, the "angels" ("Land of Lola"). Recuperating from his ordeal in Lola's dressing room, an uncomfortable Charlie notices that the performers' high-heeled boots are not designed to hold a man's weight, but Lola explains that the expensive and unreliable footwear is an essential part of any drag act.

Charlie returns to the factory and begins reluctantly laying off his workers. Lauren, one of the women on the assembly line, explodes at Charlie when given her notice, and stubbornly tells him that other struggling shoe factories have survived by entering an "underserved niche market". This gives Charlie an idea ("Land of Lola" reprise), and he invites Lola to come to the factory to help him design a women's boot that can be comfortable for a man ("Charlie's Soliloquy"/"Step One").

Lola and the angels arrive at the factory, and she is immediately unsatisfied with Charlie's first design of the boot. Quickly getting the women of the factory on her side, she draws a quick design of a boot, explaining the most important factor is by far the sex appeal ("The Sex is in the Heel").  George, the factory manager, realizes a way to make her design practical, and an impressed Charlie begs Lola to stay until a prestigious footwear show in Milan in three weeks' time, to design a new line of "kinky boots" that could save the factory. Lola is reluctant, since she is already receiving crass comments from Don, the factory foreman and some of the other factory workers but is flattered by Charlie's praise, and finally agrees.

Charlie announces that the factory will be moving ahead with production on the boots. He thanks Lauren for giving him the idea and offers her a promotion. She accepts and is horrified but thrilled to realize she is falling for him ("The History of Wrong Guys").

The next day, Lola shows up in men's clothes and is mocked by Don and his friends. An upset Lola takes refuge in the bathroom, and Charlie attempts to comfort her. Lola explains that her father trained her as a boxer, but disowned her when she showed up for a match in drag. The two discover their similarly complex feelings toward their fathers, and Lola introduces herself by her birth name: Simon ("Not My Father's Son").

Nicola arrives from the city of London and presents Charlie with a plan for the factory that her boss Richard Bailey has drawn up: closing it and converting it into condominiums. Charlie refuses but is shocked to discover that his father had agreed to this plan before he died, presumably because Charlie was not there to run it. He refuses to sell, and soon the workers are celebrating as the first pair of "kinky boots" is finished ("Everybody Say Yeah").

===Act II===

Many of the factory workers are not enthusiastic about the radical change in their product line.  Some of them, especially the intimidating Don, make Lola feel very unwelcome. Lola taunts him back, enlisting the help of the female factory workers to prove that Lola is closer to a woman's ideal man than Don ("What a Woman Wants"). Lola presents Don with a unique wager to see who is the better "man": Lola will do any one thing that Don specifies if Don will do one thing that Lola specifies. Don's challenge is for Lola to fight him in a boxing match at the pub. Charlie, remembering Lola's background, is horrified. Lola easily scores against Don in the ring but ultimately lets Don win the match ("In This Corner"). Afterwards, in private, Don asks why she let him win, and Lola replies that she could not be so cruel as to humiliate Don in front of his mates. She gives him her part of the challenge: "accept someone for who they are."

Charlie is pouring his own money into the factory to ensure it will be ready in time for Milan, and he is getting frantic that the product is not right, angrily forcing his staff to redo what he considers to be shoddy work. Nicola arrives, fed up with Charlie's obsession over the factory, and breaks up with him. Lola has been making some decisions about production and preparations without consulting Charlie. When he discovers that she has decided to have her angels wear the boots on the runway rather than hiring professional models, an overwhelmed Charlie lashes out at her, humiliating her in front of the other workers. Lola storms out, and the factory workers go home. Alone, Charlie struggles with the weight of his father's legacy and what it means to be his own man ("Soul of a Man").

Lauren finds Charlie and tells him to come back to the factory. It is revealed that Don has persuaded all the workers to return to work and to sacrifice a week's pay to ensure the boots can be finished in time for Milan. Charlie is astonished and grateful, and asks if Don has paid up on his wager by accepting Lola. Lauren explains that the person that Don has accepted is Charlie himself.

As he heads to the airport for Milan, Charlie leaves a heartfelt apology on Lola's voicemail.  Meanwhile, Lola performs her act at a nursing home in her home town. After she leaves the stage, she speaks to her now wheelchair-bound father, who is dying in the home, and reaches a sense of closure ("Hold Me in Your Heart").

Charlie and Lauren arrive in Milan, but without models Charlie is forced to walk the runway himself. Lauren is thrilled by his dedication ("The History of Wrong Guys (Reprise)") but the show threatens to be a disaster. Just as all seems lost, Lola and her angels arrive to save the day. Lauren and Charlie share their first kiss, and the whole company celebrates the success of the "Kinky Boots" ("Raise You Up/Just Be").

In Lauper's first effort at writing for the stage, she found that it required a sustained effort to write songs for the different characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/music/2013/05/14/cyndi-lauper-she%E2%80%99s-still-so-unusual|title=Cyndi Lauper: She’s Still So Unusual|accessdate=November 12, 2013|date=May 14, 2013|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|author=Peeples, Jase}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lauper joked about the difficulty of writing her first score: "How much of a stretch is it for me to write songs about fashion, funny relationships, people changing their minds and shoes?"&lt;ref name=CLwotkiKB/&gt; The first song that Lauper wrote was the opening number, which included a wide range of voices.&lt;ref name=KBfLaFtaT/&gt; Her process was to conceive a song and sing it into her [[iPhone]], and orchestrator Stephen Oremus would write it down.&lt;ref name=CLwotkiKB/&gt; Oremus would then "'blow up' the vocal line into harmonies, create the [[incidental music]] that linked scenes and songs" and orchestrate the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/arts/index.ssf/2013/03/livingston_native_stephen_orem.html|title=Livingston Native Stephen Oremus Learns 'Lauper-ese' For ''Kinky Boots''|accessdate=November 12, 2013| date=March 17, 2013|publisher=[[NJ.com]]|author=Reich, Ronni}}&lt;/ref&gt; The songs range in style "from pop to funk to new wave to tango, with highly personal lyrics".&lt;ref name=SUfaTT/&gt;  ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic Melena Ryzik wrote: "Though there are plenty of hooky, rousing numbers, the emotional heart of ''Kinky Boots'' is several ballads about the weight of parental expectations."&lt;ref name=SUfaTT/&gt; The musical uses a twelve-piece orchestra consisting of keyboards, percussion, bass, guitars, reeds, violin, viola, cello, trumpet, and trombone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=493287 |title=''Kinky Boots'' |publisher= [[Internet Broadway Database]] |accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ItP&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/Whos_who/13982/33306/Kinky-Boots | title=Inside the Playbill: ''Kinky Boots'' Opening Night at Al Hirschfeld Theatre | publisher=[[Playbill]] | work=playbillvault.com | accessdate=June 7, 2013 | page=4 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919210623/http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/Whos_who/13982/33306/Kinky-Boots | archivedate=September 19, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLane was impressed with the "series of conveyor belts that came apart, moved around, and fit the context of the story" in order to accentuate the choreography of "a troupe of men in four-inch heels". With respect to the conveyor belts, he said, "They've never been used as dynamically as this, creating a series of surprises, with the kind of wild athleticism that actually looks dangerous. It's one of the more thrilling combinations of stage design and choreography that I can recall."&lt;ref name=CR/&gt;

==Critical reaction==
Upon its October 2012 Chicago opening, ''Chicago Tribune'' critic Chris Jones described the show as a "warm, likable, brassy, sentimental, big-hearted and modestly scaled" production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/theaterloop/chi-kinky-boots-review-chicago,0,6703372.column|title=''Kinky Boots'' Kicks Up Its Colorful Heels In Pre-Broadway Premiere| accessdate=March 14, 2013| date=October 17, 2012|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Jones, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another reviewer praised the score, book, direction and, particularly, Porter, before suggesting that, before opening on Broadway, it could use a more effective opening number, better pacing in Act 2 and "the budding romance between Charlie and coworker Lauren ... needs more lead-in. In other words, give Ashford, a clear crowd favorite, more to do".&lt;ref name=Bullen/&gt;

The musical's Broadway debut received mixed to positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.didhelikeit.com/shows/kinky-boots-reviews.html_| title=Did he like it|accessdate=August 7, 2015|date=August 7, 2015|work=[[DidHeLikeIt.com]]| author=DidHeLikeIt.com}}{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was awarded a "Critic's Pick" designation by ''The New York Times, Time Out New York'' and ''New York Magazine'', and was included in ''Entertainment Weekly'' magazine's "Must See" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Kinky Boots'' Musical Website| url=http://kinkybootsthemusical.com|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Brantley]] of ''The New York Times'' gave a warm review, calling it "inspired" and comparing the work to other successful recent Broadway musicals: "Like ''[[The Full Monty (musical)|The Full Monty]]'' (choreographed by Mr. Mitchell) and ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical]]'', it is set in a hard-times British factory town, where jobs are in jeopardy and spirits need lifting. Like ''La Cage aux Folles'' and ''[[Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (musical)|Priscilla Queen of the Desert]]'', it presents drag queens as the show’s official spirit lifters. And like ''Hairspray'', the musical this production most resembles in tone, ''Kinky Boots'' is about finding your passion, overcoming prejudice and transcending stereotypes."&lt;ref name=HSHH/&gt; Brantley wrote that Lauper's "love- and heat-seeking score" wowed with her "trademark ... mix of sentimentality and eccentricity", and that the costumes and boots courtesy of Gregg Barnes made for "big red scene stealers". He also praised “Raise You Up/Just Be,” as "one of the best curtain numbers since '[[You Can't Stop the Beat]]' sent ''Hairspray'' audiences dancing out of the theater.” Brantley, however, did not extend his praise to Fierstein's script, writing that his "sticky, sermonizing side" comes through in the second half, where "all the clichés stand naked before you."&lt;ref name=HSHH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/theater/reviews/kinky-boots-the-harvey-fierstein-cyndi-lauper-musical.html|title=High Spirits, Higher Heels: ''Kinky Boots'', the Harvey Fierstein-Cyndi Lauper Musical| accessdate=April 29, 2013| date=April 4, 2013|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Brantley, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{further|History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi}}

===Leadership===
[[Muammar Gaddafi]] was the head of the Free Officers, a group of Arab nationalists that deposed [[Idris of Libya|King Idris I]] in 1969 in a "bloodless coup."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Qaddafi Is No Mubarak as Regime Overthrow May Trigger a 'Descent to Chaos' |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-23/qaddafi-is-no-mubarak-overthrow-may-mean-descent-to-chaos-.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226160548/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-23/qaddafi-is-no-mubarak-overthrow-may-mean-descent-to-chaos-.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 February 2011 |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2011 |work=Bloomberg L.P. |author=Viscus, Gregory |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He abolished the [[Constitution of Libya (1951)|Libyan Constitution of 1951]], considering it a neocolonial document. From 1969 until 1975 standards of living, life expectancy and literacy grew rapidly. In 1975 he published his manifesto ''[[The Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)|The Green Book]]''. He officially stepped down from power in 1977, and subsequently claimed to be merely a "symbolic figurehead" until 2011, with the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libyan government]] up until then also denying that he held any power.&lt;ref name="telegraph_gaddafi"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wynne-Jones|first=Jonathan|title=Libyan minister claims Gaddafi is powerless and the ceasefire is 'solid'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8393285/Libyan-minister-claims-Gaddafi-is-powerless-and-the-ceasefire-is-solid.html|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=22 October 2011|date=19 March 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jazeera_gaddafi"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaddafi: Libya dignity under attack|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/03/201132113120236750.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=22 October 2011|date=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Gaddafi, Libya was theoretically a decentralized, [[direct democracy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robbins|first=James|title=Eyewitness: Dialogue in the desert|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6425873.stm|accessdate=22 October 2011|date=7 March 2007|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; state run according to the philosophy of Gaddafi's ''The Green Book'', with Gaddafi retaining a ceremonial position. Libya was officially run by a system of people's committees which served as local governments for the country's subdivisions, an indirectly elected [[General People's Congress (Libya)|General People's Congress]] as the legislature, and the [[Cabinet of Libya|General People's Committee]], led by a Secretary-General, as the executive branch. According to [[Freedom House]], however, these structures were often manipulated to ensure the dominance of Gaddafi, who reportedly continued to dominate all aspects of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&amp;year=2010&amp;country=7862 |title=Libya|work=Country Report |publisher=[[Freedom House]] |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WikiLeaks]]' [[United States diplomatic cables leak|disclosure of confidential US diplomatic cables]] revealed US diplomats there speaking of Gaddafi's "mastery of tactical maneuvering".&lt;ref name="Whitlock 02/22"&gt;{{Cite news |author=Whitlock, Craig |title=Gaddafi Is Eccentric But the Firm Master of His Regime, Wikileaks Cables Say |work=The Washington Post |date=22 February 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/22/AR2011022207298.html|accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While placing relatives and loyal members of [[Qadhadhfa|his tribe]] in central military and government positions, he skillfully marginalized supporters and rivals, thus maintaining a delicate balance of powers, stability and economic developments. This extended even to his own sons, as he repeatedly changed affections to avoid the rise of a clear successor and rival.&lt;ref name="Whitlock 02/22"/&gt;

Both Gaddafi and the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]], however, officially denied that he held any power, but said that he was merely a symbolic figurehead.&lt;ref name="telegraph_gaddafi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jazeera_gaddafi"/&gt; While he was popularly seen as a [[demagogue]] in the West, Gaddafi always portrayed himself as a [[wikt:statesman|statesman]]-[[philosopher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bazzi|first=Mohamad|title=What Did Qaddafi's Green Book Really Say?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/books/review/what-did-qaddafis-green-book-really-say.html|accessdate=28 October 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to several Western media sources, Gaddafi feared a military coup against his government and deliberately kept Libya's military relatively weak. The [[Libyan Army (1951-2011)|Libyan Army]] consisted of about 50,000 personnel. Its most powerful units were four crack brigades of highly equipped and trained soldiers, composed of members of Gaddafi's tribe or members of other tribes loyal to him. One, the [[Khamis Brigade]], was led by his son [[Khamis Gaddafi|Khamis]]. Local militias and Revolutionary Committees across the country were also kept well-armed. By contrast, regular military units were poorly armed and trained, and were armed with largely outdated military equipment.&lt;ref name="KFMBChannel8"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/14084125/clampdown-in-libyan-capital-as-protests-close-in|title=Qaddafi Survival Means Weak Army, Co-Opted Tribes |agency=Associated Press|work=KFMB-TV|date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/03/10/134404618/gadhafis-military-muscle-concentrated-in-elite-units |title=Gadhafi's Military Muscle Concentrated In Elite Units |publisher=[[NPR]] |date= 10 March 2011 |accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Article/201009115955467 |title=Video Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi's Forces Facing Modern Firepower From RAF |publisher=Sky News |date=18 March 2011 |accessdate=2 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322213900/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Article/201009115955467 |archivedate=22 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development and corruption===
By the end of Gaddafi's 42-year rule, Libya's population had a per capita income of $14,000, though a third was estimated to still live below the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S.

Much of the state's income came from [[Oil reserves in Libya|its oil production]], which soared in the 1970s.

Libya's economy is structured primarily around the nation's energy sector, which generates about 95% of export earnings, 80% of GDP, and 99% of government income. Libya's GDP per capita ([[purchasing power parity|PPP]]), [[human development index]], and literacy rate were better than in Egypt and Tunisia, whose [[Arab Spring]] revolutions preceded the outbreak of protests in Libya.&lt;ref name = "Maleki 02/09"&gt;{{cite web| title=Uprisings in the Region and Ignored Indicators| author=Maleki, Ammar| date=9 February 2011| publisher=[[Rooz]] (via Payvand)| url=http://www.payvand.com/news/11/feb/1080.html|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libya's [[corruption perception index]] in 2010 was 2.2, ranking 146th out of 178 countries, worse than that of [[Egypt]] (ranked 98th) and [[Tunisia]] (ranked 59th).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2010 Results| work=[[Corruption Perceptions Index]]| publisher=[[Transparency International]]| accessdate=22 February 2011| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5tmOICe1G?url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results|archivedate=27 October 2010| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; One paper speculated that such a situation created a broader contrast between good education, high demand for democracy, and the government's practices (perceived corruption, political system, supply of democracy).&lt;ref name="Maleki 02/09"/&gt;

An estimated 13% of Libyan citizens were unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4515919.stm | publisher=BBC News | first=Rana | last=Jawad | title=Libya grapples with unemployment | date=5 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 16% of families had no members earning a stable income, and 43.3% had just one.

Despite this, Libya's [[Human Development Index]] in 2010 was the highest in [[Africa]] and greater than that of [[Saudi Arabia]]. Libya had [[welfare]] systems allowing access to [[free education]], [[free healthcare]], and financial assistance for housing, and the [[Great Manmade River]] was built to allow free access to fresh water across large parts of the country.&lt;ref name="dailynews"&gt;{{cite web|last=Azad |first=Sher |title=Gaddafi and the media |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2011/10/22/fea02.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025194842/http://www.dailynews.lk/2011/10/22/fea02.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 October 2011 |work=[[Daily News (Sri Lanka)|The Daily News]] |accessdate=22 October 2011 |date=22 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the worst economic conditions were in the eastern parts of the state, once a breadbasket of the ancient world, where Gaddafi extracted oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18290470 |title=A Civil War Beckons|date=3 March 2011 |work=The Economist |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Economist"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18239900 |title=Building a New Libya|date=24 February 2011 |work=The Economist |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for housing improvements and the Great Manmade River, little infrastructure was developed in this region for many years.&lt;ref name="dailynews"/&gt;  For example, the only sewage facility in Benghazi was over 40 years old, and untreated sewage has resulted in environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2056521,00.html | title=Dispatch from Libya: Why Benghazi Rebelled | work=Time | date=3 March 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312051122/http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2056521,00.html | archivedate=12 March 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several foreign governments and analysts have stated that a large share of the business enterprise was controlled by Gaddafi, his family, and the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/04/idUS108205791820110304 | title=Lesson from Libya: Despotism, Poverty and Risk |agency=Reuters| date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leaked US diplomatic cable said that the Libyan economy was "a [[kleptocracy]] in which the government – either the Gaddafi family itself or its close political allies – has a direct stake in anything worth buying, selling or owning".&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; According to US officials, Gaddafi amassed a vast personal fortune during his 42-year leadership.&lt;ref name=risen&gt;{{cite news |author1=Risen, James |author2=Lichtblau, Eric | date=9 March 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/world/africa/10qaddafi.html|title=Hoard of Cash Lets Qaddafi Extend Fight Against Rebels |work=The New York Times |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' pointed to Gaddafi's relatives adopting lavish lifestyles, including luxurious homes, Hollywood film investments, and private parties with American pop stars.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/world/africa/24qaddafi.html| title=Shady Dealings Helped Qaddafi Build Fortune and Regime |work=The New York Times | date=24 March 2011 | first1=Eric | last1=Lichtblau | first2=David | last2=Rohde | first3=James | last3=Risen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/04/libya | title=One reason Qaddafi might fold |work=The Economist | date=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddafi said that he planned to combat corruption in the state by proposing reforms where oil profits are handed out directly to the country's five million people&lt;ref name="reuters_handout"/&gt; rather than to government bodies, stating that "as long as money is administered by a government body, there would be theft and corruption."&lt;ref name="bbc_handout"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaddafi 'to hand out oil money'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7591458.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 October 2011|date=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi urged a sweeping reform of the government [[bureaucracy]], suggesting that most of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] system should be dismantled to "free Libyans from red tape" and "protect the state's budget from corruption". According to Western diplomats, this move appeared to be aimed at putting pressure on the government to speed up reforms.&lt;ref name="reuters_handout"&gt;{{cite news|title=Libya's Gaddafi tells govt to hand out oil money|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/05/08/libya-oil-gaddafi-idUKL0829452920080508|accessdate=30 October 2011|date=8 May 2008|agency=Reuters UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, Gaddafi proposed plans to dissolve the country's existing administrative structure and disburse oil revenue directly to the people. The plan included abolishing all [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]] except those of defence, internal security, and foreign affairs, and departments implementing strategic projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=19968&amp;prog=zgp&amp;proj=zdrl,zme#news |title=Libya: Ministries Abolished |publisher=[[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the ministries were failing to manage the country's oil revenues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaddafi threatens to abolish government ministries|url=http://www.meed.com/sectors/economy/gaddafi-threatens-to-abolish-government-ministries/850614.article|accessdate=29 October 2011|date=3 March 2008|work=[[MEED]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that his "dream during all these years was to give power and wealth directly to the people".&lt;ref name="reuters_oil"/&gt;

A national vote on Gaddafi's plan was held in 2009, where Libya's people's congresses, collectively the country's highest authority, voted to delay implementation. The [[General People's Congress (Libya)|General People's Congress]] announced that, of 468 [[Basic People's Congress (country subdivision)|Basic People's Congress]]es, 64 chose immediate implementation while 251 endorsed implementation "but asked for (it) to be delayed until appropriate measures were put in place". Some top government officials opposed the plan, saying that it would "wreak havoc" in the economy by "fanning [[inflation]] and spurring [[capital flight]]". Gaddafi acknowledged that the scheme, which promised up to 30,000 [[Libyan dinar]]s ($23,000) annually to about a million of Libya's poorest, may "cause chaos before it brought about prosperity," but said "do not be afraid to experiment with a new form of government" and that "this plan is to offer a better future for Libya's children".&lt;ref name="reuters_oil"&gt;{{cite news|title=Libyan congresses delay Gaddafi's oil shareout plan|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/03/03/libya-oil-idUKL359112620090303|accessdate=30 October 2011|date=3 March 2009|agency=Reuters UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libya delays Gaddafi oil plan|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2009/03/200933183343913989.html|accessdate=30 October 2011|date=3 March 2009|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 and 2011, the [[Freedom of the Press (report)|Freedom of the Press Index]] rated Libya the most-censored state in the Middle East and North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/fop/2009/FreedomofthePress2009_tables.pdf |title=Freedom of the Press 2009&amp;nbsp;– Table of Global Press Freedom Rankings |publisher=[[Freedom House]] |year=2009 |format=PDF; 696 KB |accessdate=13 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804224233/http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/fop/2009/FreedomofthePress2009_tables.pdf |archivedate=4 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of the Press 2011 |url=http://freedomhouse.org/images/File/fop/2011/FOTP2011GlobalRegionalTables.pdf |publisher=[[Freedom House]] |accessdate=17 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515162314/http://freedomhouse.org/images/File/fop/2011/FOTP2011GlobalRegionalTables.pdf |archivedate=15 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a January 2011 report of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], on which the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] sat prior to the uprising, released a month before protests began, praised certain aspects of the country's human rights record, including its [[Women in Libya|treatment of women]] and improvements in other areas.&lt;ref name="ohchr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/16session/A-HRC-16-15.pdf|work=[[Universal Periodic Review]]|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=26 October 2011|date=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya's delegation to the United Nations issued a report about human rights in Libya. The report said that the country was founded on direct people's democracy that guaranteed direct exercise of authority by all citizens through the people's congresses. Citizens were said to be able to express opinions to the congresses on political, economic, social, and cultural issues. In addition, the report stated that there were information platforms such as newspapers and TV channels for people to express their opinions through. Libyan authorities also argued that no one in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya suffered from extreme poverty and hunger, and that the government guaranteed a minimum of food and essential needs to people with low incomes. In 2006, an initiative was adopted for providing people with low incomes investment portfolios amounting to $30,000 to be deposited with banks and companies.&lt;ref name="lib.ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session9/LY/A_HRC_WG.6_9_LBY_1_Libya_E.pdf |title=U.N.

The Revolutionary Committees occasionally kept tight control over internal dissent; reportedly, 10% to 20% of Libyans worked as informants for these committees, with surveillance taking place in the government, in factories, and in the education sector.&lt;ref name="Mohamed Eljhami"/&gt; The government sometimes executed dissidents through public hangings and mutilations and re-broadcast them on [[public television]] channels.&lt;ref name="Mohamed Eljhami"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/878/libya-and-the-us-qadhafi-unrepentant|title=Libya and the U.S.: Qadhafi Unrepentant|work=The Middle East Quarterly|author=Mohamed Eljahmi|year=2006|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis 1990"&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the mid-1980s, Libya's [[intelligence]] service conducted assassinations of Libyan dissidents around the world.&lt;ref name="Mohamed Eljhami" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff (2002).

In December 2009, Gaddafi reportedly told government officials that Libya would soon experience a "new political period" and would have elections for important positions such as minister-level roles and the National Security Advisor position (a Prime Minister equivalent). He also promised that international monitors would be included to ensure fair elections. His speech was said to have caused a stir. These elections were planned to coincide with the Jamahiriya's usual periodic elections for the Popular Committees, [[General People's Committee|Basic People's Committees]], [[Basic People's Congress (country subdivision)|Basic People's Congress]]es, and [[General People's Congress (Libya)|General People's Congresses]], in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/wikileaks-files/libya-wikileaks/8294906/AL-QADHAFI-SUGGESTS-LIBYAN-ELECTIONS-MAY-BE-IN-THE-OFFING.html |title=Al-Qadhafi Suggests Libyan Elections May Be In The Offing |work=The Daily Telegraph|publisher=WikiLeaks |date=31 January 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissent was illegal under Law 75 of 1973, and in 1974, Gaddafi asserted that anyone guilty of founding a [[political party]] would be executed.&lt;ref name="Mohamed Eljhami"/&gt; With the establishment of the [[Jamahiriya]] ("state of the masses") system in 1977, he established the [[General People's Committee|Revolutionary Committees]] as conduits for raising political consciousness, with the aim of [[Direct democracy|direct]] [[Participatory democracy|political participation]] by all Libyans rather than a traditional party-based [[Representative democracy|representative system]].&lt;ref name="ham_40_1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ham|first=Anthony|title=Libya|year=2007|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|location=Footscray, Victoria|isbn=1-74059-493-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lPaNiy3YisIC|edition=2nd|pages=40–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, some of the Revolutionary Committees had eventually evolved into self-appointed, sometimes zealous, enforcers of revolutionary orthodoxy.&lt;ref name="ham_40_1"/&gt; During the early 1980s, the Revolutionary Committees had considerable power and became a growing source of tension within the Jamihiriya,&lt;ref name="vandewalle_124"/&gt; to the extent that Gaddafi sometimes criticized their effectiveness and excessive repression,&lt;ref name="ham_40_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vandewalle_124"/&gt; until the power of the Revolutionary Committees was eventually restricted in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="vandewalle_124"/&gt;

''[[The Green Book (Libya)|The Green Book]]'', which Gaddafi authored in the 1970s, was for years the principal text of political education. BBC cited a Libyan who said that teachers who called it "rubbish" could face [[capital punishment|execution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13235981|title=What now for Colonel Gadaffi's Green Book?|date=29 April 2011|accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Great Green Document on Human Rights treats the right to life as an individual human right and calls for abolition of the [[death sentence]], except in the case of persons whose lives endanger or corrupt society."&lt;ref name="lib.ohchr.org"/&gt;

In 1988, Gaddafi criticized the "excesses" he blamed on the Revolutionary Councils, stating that "they deviated, harmed, tortured" and that "the true revolutionary does not practise repression."&lt;ref name="ham_40_1"/&gt; That same year, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya issued the ''Great Green Document on Human Rights'', in which Article 5 established laws that allowed greater [[freedom of expression]]. Article 8 of The Code on the Promotion of Freedom stated that "each citizen has the right to express his opinions and ideas openly in [[General People's Congress (Libya)|People's Congresses]] and in all [[mass media]]."&lt;ref name="ohchr"/&gt; A number of restrictions were also allegedly placed on the power of the Revolutionary Committees by the Gaddafi government, leading to a resurgence in the Libyan state's popularity by the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="vandewalle_124"&gt;{{cite book | last=Vandewalle | first=Dirk J. | title=A history of modern Libya | location=Cambridge| publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2006 | isbn=0-521-85048-7| url=https://books.google.com/?id=R1Z2m6RTAp0C | accessdate=26 August 2011 | page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, however, Libya posted a $1&amp;nbsp;million bounty for journalist and governmental critic Ashur Shamis, under the allegation that he was linked to [[Al-Qaeda]] and terror suspect [[Abu Qatada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bright, Martin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/mar/28/politics.libya |title=Gadaffi Still Hunts 'Stray Dogs' in UK|work=The Guardian|date=28 March 2004|accessdate=13 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late January, Jamal al-Hajji, a writer, political commentator and accountant, "call[ed] on the Internet for demonstrations to be held in support of greater freedoms in Libya" inspired by the [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian]] revolutions.

The protests, unrest and confrontations began in earnest on 2 February 2011. They were soon nicknamed the Libyan Revolution of Dignity by the protesters and foreign media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1215/01903659-1506283 | volume=39 | issue=1 | title=A Revolution of Dignity and Poetry | year=2012 | journal=Boundary 2 | pages=137–165 | last1 = Omri | first1 = Mohamed-Salah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign workers and disgruntled minorities protested in the main square of Zawiya, Libya against the local administration. This was succeeded by race riots, which were squashed by the police and pro-Gaddafi loyalists. On the evening of 15 February, between 500 and 600 demonstrators protested in front of Benghazi's police headquarters after the arrest of human rights lawyer [[Fathi Terbil]]. Crowds were armed with petrol bombs and threw stones. Marchers hurled [[Molotov cocktail]]s in a downtown square in Benghazi, damaging cars, blocking roads, and hurling rocks. Police responded to crowds with tear gas, water cannon, and rubber bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--[if IE 6]&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt; |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/02/16/137834.html |title=Clash breaks out as Libya braces for 'day of anger' |publisher=Alarabiya.net |date=16 February 2011 |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 38 people were injured, including 10 security personnel.&lt;ref name=erupts15Feb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=William |title = Violent Protests Rock Libyan City of Benghazi |url = http://www.france24.com/en/20110216-libya-violent-protests-rock-benghazi-anti-government-gaddafi-egypt-tunisia-demonstration|work=[[France 24]]|date=16 February 2011|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Idris Al-Mesmari]] was arrested hours after giving an interview with [[Al Jazeera]] about the police reaction to protests.&lt;ref name=erupts15Feb&gt;{{cite news| title=Libyan Police Stations Torched|date=16 February 2011|publisher=Al Jazeera|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/02/20112167051422444.html |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement released after clashes in Benghazi, a Libyan official warned that the Government "will not allow a group of people to move around at night and play with the security of Libya". The statement added: "The clashes last night were between small groups of people – up to 150. Some outsiders infiltrated that group. They were trying to corrupt the local legal process which has long been in place. We will not permit that at all, and we call on Libyans to voice their issues through existing channels, even if it is to call for the downfall of the government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12477275 | publisher=BBC News | title=Libya protests: Second city Benghazi hit by violence | date=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rap]], [[hip hop]] and traditional music, alongside other genres, played a big role in encouraging dissent against Gaddafi's government. Music has been controlled and dissenting cultural figures have been arrested or tortured in [[Arab Spring]] countries, including Libya.&lt;ref name="FreeMuse 20042011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemuse.org/sw41490.asp|title=Hip-hop is a soundtrack to the North African revolt|date=20 April 2011|work=Free Muse – Freedom of Musical Expression|publisher=Freemuse, Copenhagen, Denmark|accessdate=13 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926200332/http://www.freemuse.org/sw41490.asp|archivedate=26 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music provided an important platform for communication among demonstrators. It helped to create moral support and encouraged a spirit of revolt against the governments.&lt;ref name="FreeMuse 20042011"/&gt;

An anonymous hip hop artist called [[Ibn Thabit (Libyan musician)|Ibn Thabit]] gave a voice to "disenfranchised Libyans looking for a non-violent way to express their political will".&lt;ref name="Lane 30 March 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lane|first=Nadia|date=30 March 2011|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-582738|title=Libyan Rap Fuels Rebellion|publisher=CNN|accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aslanmedia.com/music/306-music-artist-profile/3065-ibn-thabit-the-beat-behind-libyas-revolution |title=Ibn Thabit: The Beat Behind Libya's Revolution |date=8 August 2011 |publisher=Aslan Media |accessdate=13 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909082334/http://www.aslanmedia.com/music/306-music-artist-profile/3065-ibn-thabit-the-beat-behind-libyas-revolution |archivedate=9 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On his website, Ibn Thabit said that he "has been attacking Gaddafi with his music since 2008" when he posted his first song on the internet, titled "Moammar – the coward".&lt;ref name="Lane 30 March 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsignificance.com/2011/06/22/top-five-arab-spring-hip-hop-songs/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120918083916/http://www.thenewsignificance.com/2011/06/22/top-five-arab-spring-hip-hop-songs/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 September 2012 |title=Top Five Arab Spring Hip-Hop Songs |publisher=NPR |date=22 June 2011 |work=The New Significance (webzine) |accessdate=13 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrics of a song 'Al-Soo'al' released by Ibn Thabit on YouTube on 27 January 2011, weeks before the riots began in Libya were indicative of the rebel sentiment.&lt;ref name="FreeMuse 20042011"/&gt;

Some groups, such as a rock band from Benghazi called the "Guys Underground", used [[metaphor]]s to cloak the censure of the authorities. The group released a song just before the uprising entitled "Like My Father Always Says" to ridicule an autocratic fictional male head of a family which was a veiled reference to Colonel Gaddafi.&lt;ref name="FreeMuse 20042011"/&gt;

==State response==
{{further|Muammar Gaddafi's response to the Libyan Civil War}}
In the days leading up to the conflict, Gaddafi called for a rally against the government that was to be held on 17 February. The [[International Crisis Group]] believes this to have been a political manoeuvre to divert attention away from himself and the [[Jamahiriya]] political system towards government officials currently in power.&lt;ref name="crisisgroup"/&gt;

Later in February, Gaddafi stated that the rebels were influenced by [[Al-Qaeda]], [[Osama Bin Laden]], and [[hallucinogenic drugs]] put in drinks and pills. He specifically referred to substances in milk, coffee, and [[Nescafé]], and said that Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda were distributing these hallucinogenic drugs. He also blamed [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]].&lt;ref name="dailymail_gaddafi"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Williams, Davis |author2=Greenhill, Sam |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1360343/Libya-Gaddafi-blames-Osama-bin-Laden-hallucinogenic-pills-Nescafe-uprising.html |title=Now Gaddafi Blames Hallucinogenic Pills Mixed with Nescafe and bin Laden for Uprisings...

He also said that he had been receiving "thousands" of phone calls from Benghazi, from residents who were being held hostage and who wanted to be rescued. Gaddafi said in a speech addressed to Benghazi on 17 March 2011 that the rebels "can run away, they can go to Egypt...Those who would surrender their weapons and would join our side, we are the people of Libya. Those who surrender their weapons and would come without their arms, we would forgive them, and would have amnesty for those who put down their weapons.

Libya's ambassador in Malta addressed that "many people instigating unrest were arrested. Libya will show that these belonged to Al Qaeda. Some young protestors were also misled. The government is ready to dialogue with them." He cited reports from the Libyan Foreign Ministry that up to 2,500 al-Qaeda foreign operatives have been working in eastern Libya and were mostly responsible for "stirring up trouble." He concluded, "What we saw in Tahrir Square, and in Tunisia, was a clear situation. But in Libya, there is something different."&lt;ref name="maltatoday.com.mt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Balzan |first=Saviour |url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/national/Unrest-caused-by-Al-Qaeda-insurgents-govt-right-in-using-force-Ambassador |title=– Malta's news portal |publisher=Maltatoday.com.mt |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He called himself a "warrior", and vowed to fight on and die a "martyr", and urged his supporters to leave their homes and attack rebels "in their lairs". Gaddafi said that he had not yet ordered the use of force, and threatened that "everything will burn" when he did. Responding to demands that he step down, he stated that he could not step down, as he held a purely symbolic position like [[Elizabeth of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]], and that the people were in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/02/201122216458913596.html |title=Defiant Gaddafi Vows To Fight On|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence===
Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, in an interview with ABC on 17 March, stated that the rebels in Benghazi engaged in terror against the population. He stated, "You know, the armoured militia yesterday, they killed four young boys in Benghazi. Why? Because they were against them. Everybody is terrified because of the armed militia.

In the eastern city of Bayda, anti-government forces hanged two policemen who were involved in trying to disperse demonstrations. In downtown Benghazi, anti-government forces killed the managing director of al-Galaa hospital.

On 19 February, several days after the conflict began, [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] announced the creation of a commission of inquiry into the violence, chaired by a Libyan judge, as reported on [[state television]]. He stated that the commission was intended to be "for members of Libyan and foreign organizations of human rights" and that it will "investigate the circumstances and events that have caused many victims."&lt;ref name="ladepeche_libya"&gt;{{cite news|title=Libye: de nouveaux morts lors d'une opération des forces libyennes|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2011/02/19/1019008-libye-de-nouveaux-morts-lors-d-une-operation-des-forces-libyennes.html|accessdate=30 October 2011|work=[[La Dépêche du Midi]]|date=19 February 2011|language=French|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the month, he went on state television to deny allegations that the government had launched airstrikes against Libyan cities and stated that the number of protesters killed had been exaggerated.&lt;ref name="dailymail_gaddafi"/&gt;

The organization stated that "It is reasonable to fear that he has, in fact, decided to largely eliminate, wherever he still can, Libyan citizens who stood up against his regime and furthermore, to systematically and indiscriminately repress civilians. These acts can be characterized as [[crimes against humanity]], as defined in Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.fidh.org/Libya-Strategy-of-scorched-earth-desire-for |title=Libya: Strategy of Scorched Earth, Desire for Widespread and Systematic Elimination |publisher=International Federation for Human Rights |date=24 February 2011|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) chief prosecutor [[Luis Moreno-Ocampo]] estimated that 500–700 people were killed by security forces in February 2011, before the rebels took up arms. According to Moreno-Ocampo, "shooting at protesters was systematic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/world/africa/05nations.html| work=The New York Times | first1=Marlise | last1=Simons | first2=Neil | last2=MacFarquhar | title=Libyan Officials' Arrests Sought by Court in Hague | date=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, a more detailed investigation by Amnesty International found that many of the allegations against Gaddafi and the Libyan state turned out to be false or to lack any credible evidence, saying that rebels at times appeared to have knowingly made false claims or manufactured evidence.&lt;ref name="AmnestyRape"/&gt;

In July 2011, [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] had an interview with [[Russia Today]] in which he denied the ICC's allegations that he or his father [[Muammar Gaddafi]] ordered the killing of civilian protesters. He said that he was not a member of the government or the military and therefore had no authority to give such orders. He also said that his father made recorded calls to General [[Abdul Fatah Younis]], who later defected to the rebel forces, in order to request not to use force against protesters, to which he said Fatah Younis responded that protesters were attacking a military site and soldiers were acting in self-defense.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Gaddafi's son claims Nato wants deal with Libya|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/01/gaddafi-son-nato-libya-deal|accessdate=29 October 2011|work=The Guardian|date=1 July 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison sites and torture===
Gaddafi reportedly imprisoned thousands or tens of thousands residents in Tripoli, with Red Cross denied access to these hidden prisons. One of the most notorious is a prison which was set up in a tobacco factory in Tripoli where inmates are reported to have been fed just half a loaf of bread and a bottle of water a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McElroy |first=Damien |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8436286/Libya-two-British-businessmen-held-in-brutal-Libyan-prison.html |title=Libya: two British businessmen held in brutal Libyan prison |work=The Daily Telegraph |date= 8 April 2011|accessdate=21 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April, [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] [[Susan Rice]] alleged that soldiers loyal to Gaddafi were given Viagra and encouraged to commit rapes in rebel-held or disputed areas. The allegations surfaced in an ''[[Al Jazeera]]'' report the previous month from Libya-based doctors, who claimed to have found Viagra in the pockets of government soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/29/diplomat-gaddafi-troops-viagra-mass-rape |location=London |work=The Guardian| first=Ewen | last=MacAskill | title=Gaddafi 'supplies troops with Viagra to encourage mass rape', claims diplomat | date=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights groups and aid workers had previously documented rapes by loyalist fighters during the war.

In Misrata, a rebel spokesman said that government soldiers had committed a string of sexual assaults in Benghazi Street before being pushed out by rebels. A doctor said that two young sisters were raped by five Black African mercenaries after their brothers joined the rebels. According to aid workers, four young girls were abducted and held for four days, and were possibly sexually assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1380364/Libya-Gaddafis-troops-rape-children-young-eight.html |location=London |work=Daily Mail| title=Fuelled 'by Viagra', Gaddafi's troops use rape as a weapon of war with children as young as EIGHT among the victims | date=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a questionnaire 259 refugee women reported that they had been raped by Gaddafi's soldiers, however the accounts of these women could not be independently verified as the psychologist who conducted the questionnaire said that "she had lost contact with them".&lt;ref name="AmnestyRape"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/amnesty-questions-claim-that-gaddafi-ordered-rape-as-weapon-of-war-2302037.html|title=Amnesty questions claim that Gaddafi ordered rape as weapon of war|date=24 June 2011|work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=26 June 2011|first=Patrick|last=Cockburn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Libyan government alleged that the armed rebellion was composed of "criminal gangs and mercenaries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/03/13/libya.civil.war/index.html | publisher=CNN | title=Gadhafi forces retake rebel town, state TV claims | date=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Libyan official reported to Libyan television that security forces arrested Tunisians and Egyptians that were "trained to sow chaos."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/africa/2011/02/22/live-blog-libya-feb-23 |title=Live Blog – Libya Feb 23 – Al Jazeera Blogs |publisher=Blogs.aljazeera.net |date= |accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Libyan Government authorities, mercenaries from Turkey, Egypt, and Tunisia entered Libya to fight on the side of the rebels.

Initially, Qatari Prime Minister [[Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani|Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani]] declared that the country was supporting the rebels by sending "defensive weaponry" only.&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/libya/2011-09-28/behind-qatars-intervention-libya|title=Behind Qatar's Intervention In Libya|first=David|last=Roberts|date=28 September 2011|publisher=|journal=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by Sam Dagher, Charles Levinson, and Margaret Coker published by ''The Wall Street Journal'' on 17 October 2011 challenged those statements, and posited that "Qatar provided anti-Gadhafi rebels with what Libyan officials now estimate are tens of millions of dollars in aid, military training and more than 20,000 tons of weapons."&lt;ref name="wsj.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204002304576627000922764650|title=Tiny Kingdom's Huge Role in Libya Draws Concern|first1=Sam|last1=Dagher|first2=Charles|last2=Levinson|first3=Margaret|last3=Coker|date=17 October 2011|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three columnists reported anonymous sources described as "people familiar with the shipments" who confirmed that 18 weapons shipments were delivered to rebel forces between spring and summer 2011, mostly independently from the mediation of the National Transitional Council. In fact, most shipments for which Qatar paid went directly to the rebels.&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt;

According to NTC-allied officials interviewed by ''The Wall Street Journal'', a few key figures facilitated Qatar's weapons and aid to flow directly to the rebels.&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt; Cleric Ali al-Sallabi allegedly served as a primary "conduit for Qatari humanitarian aid, money and arms" and helped to direct more than a dozen of the Qatari shipments.&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt; His brother Ismail al-Salabi, leader of the Islamist "February 17 Katiba" rebel faction, was believed to be financially backed from Qatar.&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs.com"/&gt;

Abdel Hakim Belhaj, the leader of Tripoli Military Council who had previously served as the leader of the 2004 U.S. terrorist-designated [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group]] (LIFG), was among the privileged recipients of shipments from Qatar.&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard, Christopher 2009 P.16"&gt;Blanchard, Christopher. (2009). ''Libya: Background and U.S. Relations''. Congressional Research Service.

Over ten ammunition shipments sponsored by Qatar were allegedly delivered to anti-Gaddhafi forces via Sudan.&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt; Dagher, Levinson, and Coker also wrote that some government officials in Tripoli claimed that Ghaddafi's fall did not cause those shipments to be suspended. Weapons allegedly continued to be delivered to Islamist groups also in September 2011, after the removal of Libya's government.&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/qatar/11110931/How-Qatar-is-funding-the-rise-of-Islamist-extremists.html|title=How Qatar is funding the rise of Islamist extremists|first=David Blair and Richard|last=Spencer|date=20 September 2014|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reuters had reported in May 2011 that rebels from eastern Libya – where Ghaddafi's rule had ended in early February – were negotiating with Qatari banks to "facilitate international money transfers in rebel-held areas, a move aimed at recapitalising banks and boosting the economy through trade."&lt;ref name="wikileaks.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/13/1374177_-os-libya-qatar-econ-libyan-rebels-reach-out-to-qatar-for.html|title=The Global Intelligence Files - [OS] LIBYA/QATAR/ECON - Libyan rebels reach out to Qatar for 	banking lifeline|website=wikileaks.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qatari banks involved in talks with delegates from the National Transitional Council were [[Qatar Islamic Bank]] and [[Qatar National Bank]].&lt;ref name="wikileaks.org"/&gt; According to the Reuters report, Qatar was already marketing crude petroleum from oil fields in the territories controlled by the rebels and had sent "gasoline, diesel and liquefied petroleum gas" in the same areas.&lt;ref name="wikileaks.org" /&gt;

Qatar also provided training to fighters based both in eastern Libya and in the Nafusa Mountains, in the Tripoli area. David Roberts reported that Libyan fighters were even brought back to Doha for special training. Finally, on 24 August 2011, "Qatari special forces" were involved in the final assault on [[Bab al-Azizia]] compound.&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs.com" /&gt;

After clashes between Government and anti-government forces, allegations arose of the Libyan Gaddafi using foreign mercenaries. The Libyan Government's ambassador to India Ali al-Essawi said that the defections of military units had indeed led to such a decision.&lt;ref name="Jamestown 23 February 2011"/&gt; Video footage purporting to show this started to leak out of the country.&lt;ref name="Jamestown 23 February 2011"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=37551&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=f0b3ef8200af7c3a039bc6f593c6ffc6 |title=Special Commentary: Can African Mercenaries Save the Libyan Regime?|date=23 February 2011 |publisher=The Jamestown Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi's former Chief of Protocol Nouri Al Mesmari said in an interview with the Al Jazeera that [[Niger]]ien, [[Mali]]an, [[Chad]]ian and [[Kenya]]n mercenaries were among foreign soldiers helping fight the uprising on behalf of Gaddafi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Namunane, Bernard|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201102250009.html| title=Kenya: 'Dogs of War' Fighting for Gaddafi|work=AllAfrica|date=25 February 2011| accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chadian sources repudiated allegations that mercenaries from Chad were involved in the fighting in Libya. The Chadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement said that "Chadians are not sent or recruited in Chad to serve as mercenaries in Libya," and that allegations about Chadian mercenaries were "likely to cause serious physical and material harm to Chadians residing in Libya."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/37490 |title=afrol News – Libya, Chad row over "mercenaries" |publisher=Afrol.com |date= |accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to African Union chairman [[Jean Ping]], the "NTC seems to confuse black people with mercenaries,". Ping said that for the rebels, "All blacks are mercenaries. If you do that, it means (that the) one-third of the population of Libya, which is black, is also mercenaries.

Reports by EU experts stated that Gaddafi's government hired between 300 and 500 European soldiers, including some from EU countries, at high wages. According to Michel Koutouzis, who does research on security issues for the EU institutions, the UN and the French government, "In Libyan society, there is a taboo against killing people from your own tribal group.

A witness stated that mercenaries were more willing to kill demonstrators than Libyan forces were, and earned a reputation as among the most brutal forces employed by the government. A doctor in Benghazi said of the mercenaries that "they know one thing: to kill whose in front of them. Nothing else.

On 7 April, Reuters reported that soldiers loyal to Gaddafi were sent into refugee camps to intimidate and bribe black African migrant workers into fighting for the Libyan state during the war.

In June 2011, [[Amnesty International]] said it found no evidence of foreign mercenaries being used, saying the [[Black people|black Africans]] said to be "mercenaries" were in fact "sub-Saharan migrants working in Libya," and described the use of mercenaries as a "myth" that "inflamed public opinion" and led to lynchings and executions of black Africans by rebel forces.&lt;ref name="AmnestyRape"/&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] has countered that while many foreign migrants were erroneously accused of fighting with Gaddafi, there were also genuine mercenaries from several nations who participated in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2012/country-chapters/libya|title=World Report 2012: Rights Trends in World Report 2012: Libya|date=22 January 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A campaign in Serbia has organized people to spread pro-Gaddafi messages on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rferl.org/content/serb_ultranationalists_rally_for_qaddafi/2348963.html| title=Ultranationalist Serbs Organize Pro-Qaddafi Campaign | publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty | date=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddafi's aides also organized tours for foreign journalists in Tripoli. ''[[The Economist]]'' correspondent in Tripoli noted "The picture presented by the regime often falls apart, fast. Coffins at funerals have sometimes turned out to be empty. Bombing sites are recycled. An injured seven-year-old in a hospital was the victim of a car crash, according to a note passed on surreptitiously by a nurse. Journalists who point out such blatant massaging of facts are harangued in the hotel corridors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2011/07/reporting-libya | title=Reporting from Libya – Close your window |work=The Economist | date=1 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' described journalism in Gaddafi's Libya as "[[North Korea]] with palm trees". Journalist were not allowed to go anywhere, or talk to anyone, without authorization from Gaddafi's officials who always followed them. Journalists who did not report events the way Gaddafi's officials instructed faced problems and sudden deportations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/13/foreign-journalists-rixos-hotel-tripoli | title=No freedom for foreign press at Tripoli's Rixos hotel |work=The Guardian |location=London | date=14 April 2011| first=Harriet | last=Sherwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, [[Amnesty International]] criticized "Western [[Media bias|media coverage]]" which "has from the outset presented a very one-sided view of the logic of events, portraying the protest movement as entirely peaceful and repeatedly suggesting that the regime's security forces were unaccountably massacring unarmed demonstrators who presented no security challenge."&lt;ref name="AmnestyRape"/&gt;

===Human shields===
Gaddafi forces reportedly surrounded themselves with civilians to protect themselves and key military sites like the [[Bab al-Azizia]] compound in Tripoli from air strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Haynes, Deborah | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/muammar-gaddafi-using-civilians-to-protect-key-sites/story-e6frg6so-1226025907998 |title=Muammar Gaddafi Using Civilians To Protect Key Sites |work=The Australian|date=22 March 2011 | accessdate =11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International cited claims that Gaddafi had placed his tanks next to civilian facilities, using them as shields.&lt;ref name="amnesty1"/&gt;

According to Libyan state television, the rebels used human shields in Misrata.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-03-06/libyan-rebels-battle-qaddafi-s-forces-for-control-of-cities.html Businessweek – Business News, Stock market &amp; Financial Advice&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324215403/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-03-06/libyan-rebels-battle-qaddafi-s-forces-for-control-of-cities.html |date=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jamahiriya News Agency reported on a speech delivered by Leader Gaddafi to Misrata Tribes in Tripol, in which he said that the rebels "used children and women as human shields.

In June 2011, Muammar Gaddafi and his son [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi|Saif al-Islam]] announced that they were willing to hold elections and that Gaddafi would step aside if he lost. Saif al-Islam stated that the elections could be held within three months and transparency would be guaranteed through international observers.

In July 2011, Saif al-Islam accused NATO of bombing Libyan civilians, including his family members and their children, under the false pretence that their homes were military bases. He also stated that NATO offered to drop the ICC charges against him and his father if they accept a secret deal, an offer they rejected. He thus criticized the ICC as "a fake court" that is controlled by the NATO nations.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name=rt_interview&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaddafi's son: Libya like McDonald's for NATO – fast war as fast food|url=http://rt.com/news/interview-gaddafi-libya-usa/|accessdate=25 October 2011|date=1 July 2011|work=[[Russia Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Battle of Tripoli (2011)}}

Heads of the rebellion reported on 21 August that Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam, was under arrest and that they had encircled the leader's compound, suggesting that the war had reached its endgame with an imminent rebel victory. By 22 August, rebel fighters had gained entrance into Tripoli and occupied Green Square, which was promptly renamed [[Martyrs' Square, Tripoli|Martyrs' Square]] in memory of those who had died fighting in the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/libyan-rebels-converging-on-tripoli/2011/08/21/gIQAbF3RUJ_story.html|title=Gaddafi's rule crumbling as rebels enter heart of Tripoli | work=The Washington Post|location=Tripoli|first1=Thomas|last1=Erdbrink|first2=Liz|last2=Sly|accessdate=25 January 2012 | date=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on 23 August, Saif al-Islam appeared at the Gaddafi-controlled [[Rixos Hotels|Rixos Hotel]] in central Tripoli and boasted his father was still in control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Qaddafi's Son Taunts Rebels in Tripoli|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/world/africa/23libya.html|accessdate=23 August 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 August 2011|first1=David D.|last1=Kirkpatrick|first2=Kareem|last2=Fahim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same day, rebels blasted open the [[Bab al-Azizia]] compound in Tripoli through its north gates and stormed inside. Despite previous reports suggesting that Muammar Gaddafi may be inside, no members of the Gaddafi family were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/08/23/501364/main20096019.shtml |title=Libyan rebel forces penetrate Qaddafi's compound |publisher=CBS |date=23 August 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early the following day, 24 August, Gaddafi broadcast an address from a Tripoli local radio station in which he said the withdrawal from Bab al-Azizia had been a "tactical" move. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported rebel leaders as saying they believed the only areas still under Gaddafi's control, other than the immediate neighbourhood of Bab al-Azizia, were al-Hadhba and Abu Salim, the latter including the Rixos Hotel where a group of foreign journalists had been trapped for days. However, the report noted the rebels lacked a unified command and that Gaddafi loyalists and snipers remained at large in many areas of Tripoli. Local hospitals and clinics, even in areas considered under rebel control, were reporting hundreds of cases of gunshot wounds and the death toll was impossible to estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David D.|title=Qaddafi Defiant After Rebel Takeover|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/world/africa/24libya.html|accessdate=24 August 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late afternoon the journalists trapped at the Rixos Hotel had been released while heavy fighting continued in the Abu Salim region close to Bab al-Azizia and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rebels Hunt Qaddafi; Journalists in Hotel Are Free |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/world/africa/25libya.htm |accessdate=24 August 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=25 August 2011 |first1=Kareem |last1=Fahim |first2=Rick |last2=Gladstone |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114073604/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/world/africa/25libya.htm |archivedate=14 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebels were reported as estimating 400 people had been killed and a further 2,000 injured in the battle.&lt;ref name="guardian-2011-08-24"&gt;{{cite news|title=Street fighting rages in Tripoli as Gaddafi loyalists fight rearguard action|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/24/fighting-tripoli-gaddafi-libya|accessdate=25 August 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 August 2011|first1=Martin|last1=Chulov|first2=Luke|last2=Harding|first3=Julian|last3=Borger|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to mop up pro-Gaddafi forces in northwestern Libya and toward [[Sirte]] began even before the rebels fully consolidated control of Tripoli. Rebels took the city of [[Ghadames]] near the borders of Tunisia and Algeria on 29 August. Members of the Gaddafi family took flight to Algeria. In September, the Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid was besieged by rebels, who reported that Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam was hiding in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ian Black |author2=Chris Stephen |location=Misrata and Tripoli|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/19/gaddafi-son-spotted-bani-walid |title=Libya: Gaddafi son spotted in Bani Walid as heavy fighting continues|work=The Guardian |date= 19 September 2011|accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 September, the NTC captured the southern city of [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], and claimed to have found a large cache of [[chemical weapon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian Black|location= Tripoli |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/22/libyan-rebels-gaddafis-chemical-weapons |title=Libyan rebels discover Gaddafi's chemical weapons|work=The Guardian |date= 22 September 2011|accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns were raised over the danger of Gaddafi mounting an insurgency against the new authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/10/05/idINIndia-59724420111005|title=Gaddafi determined to avoid Saddam Hussein's fate|date=5 October 2011|agency=Reuters India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-October 2011, much of the city of [[Sirte]] had been taken by NTC forces, although [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|fierce fighting continued around the city center]], where many pro-Gaddafi fighters were encamped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/ferocious-fighting-in-sirte-as-ntc-tightens-grip |title=Ferocious fighting in Sirte as NTC tightens grip – Channel 4 News |publisher=Channel4.com |date=8 October 2011 |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NTC captured the whole of Sirte on 20 October 2011, and reported that Gaddafi himself had been killed in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE79J09O20111020|title=Libya forces capture Sirte|agency=Reuters Africa|date= 20 October 2011|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15389550|title=Muammar Gaddafi killed in Libya|work=BBC|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some civilian Gaddafi supporters remaining in the city reported that women and children had been killed in crossfire or fired upon by rebel forces. There were also reports of harassment and theft by rebels, however the rebel army indicated it would leave unarmed civilians "to their own devices", and had allowed families in the city access to supplies and medical assistance.&lt;ref name="telegraph_sirte"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherlock|first=Ruth|title=Gaddafi loyalists stranded as battle for Sirte rages|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8802302/Gaddafi-loyalists-stranded-as-battle-for-Sirte-rages.html|accessdate=28 October 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=2 October 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NTC fighters claim Bani Walid.jpg|thumb|Libyan rebels have entered the town of [[Bani Walid]]]]
Despite the defeat of Gaddafi's [[loyalists]], the capture of last loyalist cities and Gaddafi's death, Saif al-Islam, Gaddafi's son and successor, remained hiding in the southern region of Libya until his capture in mid-November. In addition, some loyalist forces crossed into Niger, though the escape attempts exploded into violence when detected by Nigerien troops.

Sporadic clashes between NTC and former loyalists also continued across Libya with low intensity. On 23 November 2011, seven people were killed in clashes at Bani Walid, five of them among the revolutionary forces and one Gaddafi loyalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/11/23/178863.html|title=Fresh clashes in Libya's Bani Walid; U.N. says 7,000 held in militia prisons|date=23 November 2011|accessdate=3 January 2012|publisher=Al Arabiya|agency=Agence France-Presse|location=Bani Walid and Tripoli|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104002523/http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/11/23/178863.html|archive-date=4 January 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on 3 January, Libya's government named a retired general from Misrata, Yousel al-Manquosh, as head of the country's armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cunningham|first=Erin|title=Will new army chief end the bloodshed in Libya?|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/the-casbah/libya-appoints-head-new-army|accessdate=6 January 2012|newspaper=GlobalPost|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bani Walid was captured by local tribal fighters on 23 January, due to the NTC's perceived inability to cooperate with them.&lt;ref name=norevolt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL5E8CO2HB20120124|title=UPDATE 1-Anger, chaos but no revolt after Libya violence|date=24 January 2012|accessdate=24 January 2012|agency=Reuters Africa|location=Bani Walid|first=Oliver|last=Holmes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aljazeera2401/&gt; The local forces were said to have used heavy weapons and numbered 100–150 men.&lt;ref name=aljazeera2401/&gt; Eight NTC fighters were killed and at least 25 wounded, with the rest fleeing the city.&lt;ref name=norevolt/&gt; Clashes were also reported in Benghazi and Tripoli.&lt;ref name=aljazeera2401/&gt;

The NTC has functioned as an interim legislature during the transitional period. In early May 2012, it passed its most sweeping measures to date, granting immunity to former rebel fighters for acts committed during the civil war and ordering that all detainees accused of fighting for Gaddafi should be tried or released by 12 July 2012. It also adopted Law 37, prohibiting the publication of "[[propaganda]]" criticising the revolution, questioning the authority of Libya's governing organs, or praising Muammar Gaddafi, his family, his government, or the ideas of the ''[[The Green Book (Libya)|Green Book]]''.&lt;ref name="immunity"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/05/03/211978.html|publisher=Al Arabiya|title=Libya grants immunity to 'revolutionaries'|date=3 May 2012|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A September 2013 report by ''[[The Independent]]'' shows that Libya had plunged into its worst political and economic crisis since the defeat of Gaddafi. The production of oil had almost completely stopped and the government had lost control of large areas of the country to the militias, while violence increased throughout the country.&lt;ref name="TheIndepenedentLawlessness"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/special-report-we-all-thought-libya-had-moved-on--it-has-but-into-lawlessness-and-ruin-8797041.html|title=Special report: We all thought Libya had moved on – it has, but into lawlessness and ruin|date=3 September 2013|accessdate=12 September 2013|location=London|work=The Independent|first=Patrick|last=Cockburn}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2014, conflicts between several factions in Libya had descended into a [[Libyan Civil War (2014–present)|second civil war]].

Independent numbers of dead and injured in the conflict have still not been made available. Estimates have been widely varied.

On 24 February, Libya's ambassador to Malta said that Gaddafi's government believed the number of dead to be about 300, including civilians, police officers, and soldiers.&lt;ref name="maltatoday.com.mt"/&gt; The exact same day, the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]] reported that the [[International Criminal Court]] estimated 10,000 had been killed.&lt;ref name="Irib"&gt;{{cite web|date=24 February 2011 |url=http://english.irib.ir/news/political/item/71535-death-toll-in-libyan-popular-uprising-at-10000 |title=Death Toll in Libyan Popular Uprising at 10,000 |work=[[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]] |accessdate=5 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728152435/http://english.irib.ir/news/political/item/71535-death-toll-in-libyan-popular-uprising-at-10000 |archivedate=28 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers of injured were estimated to be around 4,000 by 22 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/africa/2011/02/22/live-blog-libya-feb-22|title=Al Jazeera Live Blog Libya – February 22 |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=22 February 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated approximately 2,000 killed.

In June 2011, [[Amnesty International]] stated that earlier estimates of the initial clashes in February were exaggerated. It estimated that during the first few days of the conflict, 100 to 110 people were killed in Benghazi and 59 to 64 were killed in [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]].&lt;ref name="AmnestyRape"/&gt;

On 8 September, Naji Barakat, the Health Minister of the [[National Transitional Council]], stated that about half of an estimated 30,000 dead were believed to have been pro-Gaddafi fighters. War wounded were estimated as at least 50,000, of which about 20,000 were serious injuries, but this estimate was expected to rise.&lt;ref name=ap-20110908&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/9835879 |title=Libyan estimate: At least 30,000 died in the war |author=Karin Laub |agency=Associated Press |work=The Guardian |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=25 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was no independent verification of the Health Minister's statement and, one month later, the NTC reduced the estimated number of killed to 25,000.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/residents-flee-gaddafi-hometown-20111003-1l49x.html |title=Residents flee Gaddafi hometown |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=3 October 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011|agency=Agence France-Presse|first1=Rory|last1=Mulholland|first2=Jay|last2=Deshmukh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, the new Libyan government, based on figures still being checked, estimated the number of killed to be actually far lower than previous estimates, with 4,700 rebel supporters and a similar number of Gaddafi supporters killed during the conflict. An estimated 2,100 people on both sides were missing.&lt;ref name="revolutioncasualties"&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian Black, Middle East editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/08/libyan-revolution-casualties-lower-expected-government |title=Libyan revolution casualties lower than expected, says new government |publisher=Guardian |date= 8 January 2013|accessdate=2 October 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project]], which compiles a database of all reported fatalities due to political violence on the African continent, listed 6,109 fatalities from 15 February to 23 October 2011, of which 1,319 prior to NATO intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACLED Version 5 (1997–2014)|url=http://www.acleddata.com/data/version-5-data-1997-2014/|publisher=Armed Conflict Location and Event Dataset|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]], a public data resource that includes information on different types of organized violence (e.g. actors involved, casualties, date, location, etc.), reported that between 1,914 and 3,466 people were killed during the 2011 fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=95&amp;regionSelect=1-Northern_Africa# |title=Uppsala conflict data program, Libya, Libya: government (entire conflict), viewed April 2013 |publisher=Ucdp.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition their data shows that between 152 and 168 civilians were deliberately killed by the pro-Gaddafi forces in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=95&amp;regionSelect=1-Northern_Africa# |title=Uppsala conflict data program, Libya, 2011, viewed April 2013 |publisher=Ucdp.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no combat casualties amongst the coalition forces, although one RAF airman was killed in an accident in Italy.

===Legal qualification===
[[File:President Barack Obama speaking on the military intervention in Libya at the National Defense University 9.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] speaking on the military intervention in Libya at the National Defense University.]]
Legal qualification of an armed conflict determines which rules of [[international humanitarian law]] apply to the conduct of the parties during that conflict. In general, the normative framework applicable to international conflicts is broader and more detailed than the sum of rules that apply in conflicts not of an international character.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kolb, Robert and Hyde, Richard. ''An Introduction to the International Law of Armed Conﬂicts''. Hart Publishing, 2008, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The qualification of the Libyan conflict is the subject of some academic controversy. While most agree that the intensity of the fighting and the organization of the insurgents quickly rose to the level required for the existence of a non-international armed conflict under [[Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions|Common Article 3]] of the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]],&lt;ref name="Macak1"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=International Community Law Review |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=406–410 |title=The Applicability of International Humanitarian Law to the Conﬂict in Libya |author1=Macak, Kubo |author2=Zamir, Noam |doi=10.1163/18719732-12341238 |url= http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/18719732-12341238 |accessdate=15 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston1"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Conﬂict &amp; Security Law |year=2012 |volume=17 |pages=92–93 |title=Transformations of Conflict Status in Libya |author=Johnston, Katie A. |doi=10.1093/jcsl/krs009 |url= http://jcsl.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/1/81.abstract |accessdate=15 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the exact date when these conditions were considered fulfilled ranges from late February&lt;ref name="Macak2"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=International Community Law Review |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=4 |page=410 |title=The Applicability of International Humanitarian Law to the Conﬂict in Libya |author1=Macak, Kubo |author2=Zamir, Noam |doi=10.1163/18719732-12341238 |url= http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/18719732-12341238 |accessdate=15 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 10 March 2011.&lt;ref name="ICRC_10032011" /&gt;

It is generally accepted that the military intervention by a multi-state coalition acting under the [[Security Council]] mandate since 19 March 2011 occasioned an international armed conflict between Libya and the intervening states.&lt;ref name="Macak3"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=International Community Law Review |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=411–413 |title=The Applicability of International Humanitarian Law to the Conﬂict in Libya |author1=Macak, Kubo |author2=Zamir, Noam |doi=10.1163/18719732-12341238 |url= http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/18719732-12341238 |accessdate=15 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston2"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Conﬂict &amp; Security Law |year=2012 |volume=17 |page=95 |title=Transformations of Conflict Status in Libya |author=Johnston, Katie A. |doi=10.1093/jcsl/krs009 |url= http://jcsl.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/1/81.abstract |accessdate=15 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some academics believe that this intervention transformed the legal nature of the conflict as a whole, with the result that even the rebels should have been considered as one of the parties to an overarching international conflict spanning the whole Libyan territory.&lt;ref name="Johnston2" /&gt; Others doubt this on account of both legal and factual considerations.&lt;ref name="Macak4"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=International Community Law Review |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=413–415, 418–423 |title=The Applicability of International Humanitarian Law to the Conﬂict in Libya |author1=Macak, Kubo |author2=Zamir, Noam |doi=10.1163/18719732-12341238 |url= http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/18719732-12341238 |accessdate=15 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, it remains unsettled whether or not the rebels' overthrow of Gaddafi's government following the [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|fall of Tripoli]] in August 2011 changed the nature of the conflict again. Some academics believe that as the rebels were now the legitimate and effective government of the state of Libya, the conflict was "deinternationalised" and thus non-international in nature again.&lt;ref name="Milanovic"&gt;Milanovic, Marko and Hadzi-Vidanovic, Vidan.

Consequently, these authors would consider that the international nature of the conflict remained unchanged until the end of hostilities.&lt;ref name="Macak5"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=International Community Law Review |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=423–429 |title=The Applicability of International Humanitarian Law to the Conﬂict in Libya |author1=Macak, Kubo |author2=Zamir, Noam |doi=10.1163/18719732-12341238 |url= http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/18719732-12341238 |accessdate=15 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ongoing conflict (or conflicts) ended for the purposes of legal qualification with the conclusion of hostilities in Libya in the end of October 2011.&lt;ref name="Macak6"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=International Community Law Review |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=429–434 |title=The Applicability of International Humanitarian Law to the Conﬂict in Libya |author1=Macak, Kubo |author2=Zamir, Noam |doi=10.1163/18719732-12341238 |url= http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/18719732-12341238 |accessdate=15 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston4"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Conﬂict &amp; Security Law |year=2012 |volume=17 |page=115 |title=Transformations of Conflict Status in Libya |author=Johnston, Katie A. |doi=10.1093/jcsl/krs009 |url= http://jcsl.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/1/81.abstract |accessdate=15 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish government]] donated medical supplies and other humanitarian aid and the UN [[World Food Programme]] provided food. Turkey sent a hospital ship to Misrata and a Turkish cargo ship brought 141 tons of humanitarian aid.&lt;ref name="reliefweb1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihh.org.tr/ihh-dan-libya-ya-insani-yardim-gemisi/en/ |title=IHH Sends Humanitarian Aid Ship to Libya |publisher=IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507150720/http://www.ihh.org.tr/ihh-dan-libya-ya-insani-yardim-gemisi/en/ |archivedate=7 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the UN sanctioned military intervention has been implemented on humanitarian grounds, UN agencies seeking to ease the humanitarian crisis repeatedly rejected offers of support from the military to carry out the agencies' humanitarian operations.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Metcalfe, Victoria (2011). [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5747&amp;title=friend-foe-military-intervention-in-libya "Friend or Foe? Military Intervention in Libya"]. [[Overseas Development Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions under which such support may be accepted are outlined in the Guidelines on the Use of Military and Civil Defence Assets to Support United Nations Humanitarian Activities in Complex Emergencies (MCDA), whereby military support can be used but only temporarily and as a last resort.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Yet, there remains the concern that aid agencies' neutrality will be brought into question by accepting military support, putting aid staff at risk of being [[Attacks on humanitarian workers|attacked]] and causing some parties to prevent the agencies accessing all the areas they need to.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Furthermore, the military may not always have the technical skills required to assess the need for aid and to ensure its effective distribution.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Despite this, offers continue for the creation of an [[Humanitarian corridor|aid corridor]] and aid agencies have accepted military logistical support in the past, for instance in the [[2010 Pakistan floods]] response.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

The town of [[Tawergha]], which supported Gaddafi prior to its [[Battle of Tawergha|capture]] by anti-Gaddafi fighters in August, has been emptied of its mostly black inhabitants in what appeared to be a "major reprisal against supporters of the Gaddafi regime", according to an 11 September report from ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', and commanders of the [[Misrata Brigade]] are refusing to allow the displaced townspeople to return.

A provisional refugee camp set up at [[Ras Ajdir]] with a capacity for 10,000 was overflowing with an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 refugees. Many tens of thousands were still trapped on the Libyan side of the frontier. By 3 March, the situation was described as a logistical nightmare, with the [[World Health Organization]] warning of the risk of epidemics.&lt;ref&gt;Sayar, Scott; [[Alan Cowell|Cowell, Alan]] (3 March 2011).

To continue responding to the needs of people staying at the [[Ras Ajdir]] crossing point in Tunisia, the WFP and [[Secours Islamique-France]] were upgrading a kitchen that would provide breakfast for families. Separately, the ICRC advised it was handing over its operations at the Choucha Camp to the [[Tunisian Red Crescent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/update/2011/libya-update-2011-04-15.htm |title=Libya: More Aid To Reach Misrata and Other Areas |publisher= [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 24 March, the WFP supplied over 42,500 cooked meals for TCNs at the Saloum border.

''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' reported on 11 September that almost the entire population of [[Tawergha]], a town of about 10,000 people, had been forced to flee their homes by anti-Gaddafi fighters after their [[Battle of Tawergha|takeover of the settlement]]. The report suggested that Tawergha, which was dominated by [[black people|black]] Libyans, may have been the subject of [[ethnic cleansing]] provoked by a combination of [[racism]] and bitterness on the part of [[Misrata]]n fighters over the town's support for Gaddafi during the [[Battle of Misrata|siege of Misrata]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated11/&gt;

===Economic, religious and tribal===
Oil prices around the world increased during the Libyan conflict, due to [[oil reserves in Libya|the country's significant oil reserves]]. The [[Arabian Gulf Oil Company]], the second-largest state-owned oil company in Libya, announced plans to use oil funds to support anti-Gaddafi forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=11 March 2011|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL3E7EB03B20110311|title=Libya's Arabian Gulf Oil Co Hopes To Fund Rebels Via Crude Sales-FT|agency=Reuters Africa|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic leaders and clerics in Libya, notably the [[Network of Free Ulema – Libya]] urged all Muslims to rebel against Gaddafi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFLDE71K1TQ20110221 |title=Update 1-Libyan Islamic Leaders Urge Muslims To Rebel|agency=Reuters Africa|date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and [[Magarha]] tribes announced their support of the protesters.&lt;ref name=aljazeeradefiant/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-hussein-22-02-2011"/&gt; The [[Zuwayya]] tribe, based in eastern Libya, threatened to cut off oil exports from fields in its part of Libya if Libyan security forces continued attacking demonstrators.&lt;ref name="bbc-hussein-22-02-2011"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Hussein, Mohammed|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12528996|title = Libya Crisis: What Role Do Tribal Loyalties Play?|publisher=BBC News|date=21 February 2011|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many states and [[supranational]] bodies condemned Gaddafi's government over disputed allegations of air attacks on civilian targets within the country. Virtually all Western countries cut off diplomatic relations with Gaddafi's government over disputed reports of an aerial bombing campaign in February and March, and a number of other countries led by [[Peru]] and [[Botswana]] did likewise. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970]] was adopted on 26 February, freezing the assets of Gaddafi and ten members of his inner circle and restricting their travel. The resolution also referred the actions of the government to the [[International Criminal Court]] for investigation,&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt; and an arrest warrant for Gaddafi was issued on 27 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13927208 |title=Libya: Muammar Gaddafi Subject to ICC Arrest Warrant |publisher=BBC News|date=27 June 2011|accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by an arrest warrant issued by [[Interpol]] on 8 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/09/us-libya-gaddafi-interpol-idUSTRE7882D220110909 |agency=Reuters|first=John | last=Irish | title=Interpol issues arrest warrant for Muammar Gaddafi | date=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disputed allegations about the Libyan government's use of the [[Libyan Air Force (1951-2011)|Libyan Air Force]] to strike civilians led to the adoption of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]] to create a [[Libyan no-fly zone]] on 17 March, though several countries involved in the resolution's enforcement have also carried out regular strike missions to degrade the offensive capacity of the [[Libyan Army (1951-2011)|Libyan Army]] and destroy the government's [[command and control]] capabilities, effectively acting in ''[[de facto]]'' support of [[anti-Gaddafi forces]] on the ground. The later British parliament's [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]] inquiry concluded that by summer 2011 British policy had become one of [[regime change]].&lt;ref name=bbc-20160914&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37356873 |title=MPs attack Cameron over Libya 'collapse' |work=BBC News |date=14 September 2016 |accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hoc-libya&gt;{{cite report |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmfaff/119/119.pdf |title=Libya: Examination of intervention and collapse and the UK's future policy options |work=Foreign Affairs Committee (House of Commons) |publisher=UK Parliament |date=6 September 2016 |id=HC 119 |accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China and Russia, originally abstaining on [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]] due to the influence of the Arab League, pointed out that the implemented "no-fly-zone" had gone much further out of the originally agreed aims.&lt;ref name=tco-libya&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8393950/Libya-attacks-criticised-by-Arab-League-China-Russia-and-India.html |title=Libya: Libya attacks criticised by Arab League, China, Russia and India |date=21 March 2011|id=HC 119 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

100 countries recognized the anti-Gaddafi [[National Transitional Council]] as Libya's legitimate representative, with many of those countries explicitly describing it as the legal interim government of the country due to the perceived loss of legitimacy on the part of Gaddafi's government, though the National Transitional Council never obtained authority and security across all of Libya.&lt;ref name=hoc-libya/&gt;

Many states also either issued [[travel advisory|travel advisories]] or attempted evacuations. Some evacuations were successful to [[Malta]] or via land borders to [[Egypt]] or [[Tunisia]]; other attempts were hindered by tarmac damage at [[Benghazi]]'s airport or refusals of permission to land in [[Tripoli]]. There were also several solidarity protests in other countries that were mostly composed of Libyan [[expatriates]]. Financial markets around the world had adverse reactions to the instability with oil prices rising to a two-and-a-half year high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/oil-jumps-after-western-attacks-on-libya-20110319-1c101.html | work=Sydney Morning Herald | title=Oil jumps after Western attacks on Libya | date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=August 2017}}{{Redirect|Extirpation|the surgical term referring to removal of solid matter from the body|[[thrombectomy]], [[endarterectomy]], or [[choledocholithotomy]]}}

'''Local extinction''' or '''extirpation''' is the condition of a [[species]] (or other [[taxon]]) that ceases to exist in the chosen geographic area of study, though it still exists elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Ladle|editor1-first=Richard |editor2-first=Robert J. |editor2-last=Whittaker|title=Conservation Biogeography|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781444398113|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local [[extinction]]s are contrasted with global extinctions.

Local extinctions may be followed by a replacement of the species taken from other locations; [[wolf reintroduction]] is an example of this.

== Conservation ==

Local extinctions mark a change in the [[ecology]] of an area.

The area of study chosen may reflect a natural subpopulation, political boundaries, or both. The Cetacean Specialist Group of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] has assessed the threat of a local extinction of the [[Black Sea]] stock of [[Harbour Porpoise]] (''Phocoena phocoena'') that touches six different countries. [[COSEWIC]], by contrast, investigates wildlife only in Canada, so assesses only the risk of a Canadian local extinction even for species that cross into the United States or other countries. Other subpopulations may be naturally divided by political or country boundaries.

Many crocodilian species have experienced localized extinction, particularly the [[saltwater crocodile]] (''Crocodylus porosus''), which has been extirpated from Vietnam, Thailand, Java, and many other areas.

Often a subpopulation of a species will also be a [[subspecies]]. For example, the recent disappearance of the [[Black Rhinoceros]] (''Diceros bicornis'') from [[Cameroon]] spells not only the local extinction of rhinoceroses in Cameroon, but also the global extinction of the [[Western Black Rhinoceros]] (''Diceros bicornis longipes'').

In at least one case, scientists have found a local extinction useful for research: In the case of the [[Bay checkerspot butterfly]], scientists, including [[Paul R. Ehrlich]], chose not to intervene in a local extinction, using it to study the danger to the world population.&lt;ref name="Holsinger"&gt;Holsinger, Kent.  "[http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/eeb310/lecture-notes/checkerspot/node4.html Local extinction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311042359/http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/eeb310/lecture-notes/checkerspot/node4.html |date=2007-03-11 }}".  ''Population Viability Analysis:  Bay Checkerspot Butterfly''.  URL accessed August 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, similar studies are not carried out where a global population is at risk.

== IUCN subpopulation and stock assessments ==
While the [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) mostly only categorizes whole species or subspecies, assessing the global risk of extinction, in some cases it also assesses the risks to stocks and populations, especially to preserve genetic diversity. In all, 119 stocks or subpopulations across 69 species have been assessed by the IUCN in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[[IUCN Red List]], search for only stocks and subpopulations [http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/search.php?freetext=&amp;modifier=phrase&amp;criteria=wholedb&amp;taxa_stock=1&amp;Submit.x=0&amp;Submit.y=0&amp;redlistCategory%5B%5D=all&amp;redlistAssessyear%5B%5D=all&amp;country%5B%5D=all&amp;aquatic%5B%5D=all&amp;regions%5B%5D=all&amp;habitats%5B%5D=all&amp;threats%5B%5D=all]{{Dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of stocks and populations assessed by the IUCN for the threat of local extinction:
* [[Marsh deer]] (three subpopulations assessed)
* [[Blue whale]], North Pacific stock and North Atlantic stock
* [[Bowhead whale]], ''Balaena mysticetus'' (five subpopulations assessed), from Critically Endangered to [[LR/cd]]
* [[Lake sturgeon]], ''Acipenser fulvescens'', Mississippi &amp; Missouri Basins subpopulation assessed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]]
* Wild [[common carp]], ''Cyprinus carpio'' (River Danube subpopulation)
* [[Black-flanked rock-wallaby]] ''Petrogale lateralis'' (MacDonnell Ranges subpopulation and Western Kimberly subpopulation)

The IUCN also lists countries where assessed species, subspecies or subpopulations are found, and from which countries they have been extirpated or reintroduced.

The IUCN has only three entries for subpopulations that have become extinct&lt;ref&gt;[[IUCN Red List]], search for extinct stocks and populations: [http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/search.php?freetext=&amp;modifier=phrase&amp;criteria=wholedb&amp;taxa_stock=1&amp;Submit.x=0&amp;Submit.y=0&amp;redlistCategory%5B%5D=EX&amp;redlistCategory%5B%5D=EW&amp;redlistAssessyear%5B%5D=all&amp;country%5B%5D=all&amp;aquatic%5B%5D=all&amp;regions%5B%5D=all&amp;habitats%5B%5D=all&amp;threats%5B%5D=all]{{Dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;the [[Aral Sea]] stock of [[Ship sturgeon]] (''Acipenser nudiventris''); the [[Adriatic Sea]] stock of [[Beluga sturgeon|Beluga]] (''Huso huso''); and the [[Mexican wolf|Mexican]] subpopulation of [[Wolf]] (''Canis lupus''), which is extinct in the wild. No plant or fungi subpopulations have been assessed by the IUCN.

== Local extinction events ==

Major environmental events, such as volcanic eruptions, may lead to large numbers of local extinctions, such as with the [[1980 Mount St. Helens eruption]], which led to a [[fern spike]] extinction.

'''Christ's agony at Gethsemane''' is a passage in the [[Gospel of Luke]] (22:43–44), describing a prayer of [[Jesus]], after which he receives strength from an angel, on the Mount of Olives prior to his betrayal and arrest. It is one of several passages which appear in most versions of the [[New Testament]], but are absent in earlier manuscripts.

The situation of Jesus, prior to the completion of his ministry, begging weakness to God to perform the difficult task has been compared to [[Book of Exodus|Exodus 3]], wherein the prophet [[Moses]] speaks to God and pleads weakness when told to confront Pharaoh.&lt;ref&gt;Busse, Heribert. "Islam, Judaism and Christianity: Theological and Historical Affiliations", 1998. p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authenticity of the passage has been disputed by scholars since the second half of the 19th century. The verses are placed in double brackets in modern editions of the Greek text, and in a footnote in the [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]].

== Text ==
::'''Greek '''

; Relocate passage
Manuscripts of the textual family [[Family 13|''f''&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;]] transpose the passage after Matthew 26:39. Several lectionaries transpose Luke 22:43-45a after Matthew 26:39.

; Lacuna
[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]] (22:19-23:25) and [[Minuscule 33]] (Luke 21:38-23:26) lack the text for this passage.

; Individuals

[[Thomas Hartwell Horne]] (1856): "the reason for the omission of these verses in some manuscripts and for their being marked as suspected in others, is by some supposed to have been that they were rejected by some of the more timid, lest they should appear to favour the Arians: it may be that they were omitted in Luke from their being early read in a lesson containing part of Matt. XXVI."&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Tregelles, ''An Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures'' (London 1856),Vol 4 p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dean Burgon]] (1883) said that "These two Verses were excised through mistaken piety by certain of the orthodox, jealous for the honour of their LORD, and alarmed by the use which the impugners of His GOD head freely made of them. "He also cites Ephraem, who "puts... into the mouth of Satan, addressing the host of Hell" a statement of rejoicing over the Lord's agony.&lt;ref&gt;Burgon, ''The Revision Revised'', 1883&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Crawford Burkitt]] called this passage as "the Greater Interpolations".&lt;ref&gt;F. C. Burkitt, ''The Old Latin and the Itala'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Herman C. Hoskier]] it can be result of the influence of the [[Docetism|docetics]] of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;H. C. Hoskier, ''Codex B and its Allies'' (London 1914), vol. 1, p. 408&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joel B. Green]] and Scott McKnight (1992) wrote in ''The Dictionary of Jesus and the Gospels'', "Others, however, observe the impressive Lukan character of these verses, which speaks for their originality to the Third Gospel. In addition to (1) the inclusion of characteristic Lukan vocabulary (Green 1988, 56–57), one may also observe (2) the Lukan emphasis on the appearance of an angel (e.g., 1:11, 26; 2:13, 15; Acts 5:19; 7:30; 8:26; 10:3; 12:7), (3) Luke’s interest in simile (“his sweat was like drops of blood,” v. 44; cf. e.g., 3:22; 10:18; 11:44; 22:31) and (4) Luke’s fondness for physical manifestations (like sweat) accompanying extramundane events (e.g., 1:20; 3:22; Acts 2:2–3; 9:18). These data, along with the fact that the presence of these verses is of a piece with Luke’s interpretation of this scene as a whole, point clearly to the originality of 22:43–44. 
Moreover, it is not difficult to imagine a rationale for the early exclusion of these verses in the manuscript tradition. The portrait of Jesus contained therein—human, agonizing, needful, requiring angelic support—would have been problematic to some (cf. Gos. Nic. 20; Green 1988, 56). Accordingly, they may have been dropped for doctrinal reasons. There is thus good reason for taking these verses as original to Luke." &lt;ref&gt;p.266-67 Green, J. B., McKnight, S., &amp; Marshall, I. H. (1992). Dictionary of Jesus and the Gospels&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kurt Aland]] (1995): "These verses exhibit a conclusive clue to their secondary nature (like the Pericope Adulterae) in the alternative locations for its insertion. While the majority of the (now known) manuscripts place them at Luke 22:43-44, they are found after Matthew 26:39 in the minuscule family 13 and in several lectionaries. This kind fluctuation in the New Testament manuscript tradition is one of the surest evidences for the secondary character of a text."&lt;ref name=Aland&gt;{{Cite book

[[Bruce M. Metzger]] (2005): "These verses are absent from some of the oldest and best witnesses, including the majority of the Alexandrian manuscripts. It is striking to note that the earliest witnesses attesting the verses are three Church fathers – Justin, Irenaeus, and Hippolytus – each of whom uses the verses in order to counter Christological views that maintained that Jesus was not a full human who experienced the full range of human sufferings. It may well be that the verses were added to the text for just this reason, in opposition to those who held to a docetic Christology".&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration'' ([[Oxford University Press]]: 2005), p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Bart D. Ehrman]] (1993) these two verses disrupt the literary structure of the scene (the [[chiasmus]]), they are not found in the early and valuable manuscripts, and they are the only place in Luke where Jesus is seen to be in agony. Ehrman concludes that they were inserted in order to counter [[doceticism]], the belief that Jesus, as divine, only ''seemed'' to suffer. While probably not original to the text, these verses reflect first-century tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Bart D. Ehrman, ''The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture'' ([[Oxford University Press]]: 1993), pp. 187-194&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Melodifestivalen 2011''' was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] song contest held between February and March 2011. It selected Sweden's 51st song to represent [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest]], and was the 50th edition of [[Melodifestivalen]]. [[Eric Saade]], with the song "[[Popular (Eric Saade song)|Popular]]", won the contest and thus was selected to represent Sweden in the [[2011 Eurovision Song Contest]].

== Format ==
The 2011 edition of Melodifestivalen was similar to the previous year's arrangement, with four semi-finals, a second-chance round and a grand final. The four semi-finals were held in [[Luleå]] (5 February), [[Gothenburg]] (12 February), Linköping (19 February) and [[Malmö]] (26 February). The second chance round was held in [[Sundsvall]] on 5 March and the final in Stockholm was held on 12 March.&lt;ref name="Sweden1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/15994|title=Changes in Melodifestivalen 2011 announced|last=Yalcinkaya|first=Hakan|date=9 July 2010|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweden2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Juhas |first=Ervin |title=Sweden: Rules of Melodifestivalen 2011 |url=http://escdaily.com/articles/2387 |publisher=''ESCDaily'' |accessdate=12 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714021951/http://escdaily.com/articles/2387 |archivedate=14 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SVT presented the competing songs during autumn 2010.

As in 2010 and 2009, a maximum of eight people were allowed on stage, while only persons of 16 years or over would be eligible. (However, in accordance with Eurovision rules, only six people were allowed on stage for the Swedish entry at Eurovision.) The main singer(s) had to perform vocals live on stage, however other backing vocals could be pre-recorded along with the song's backing track.

There was a large change in the way that the 32 songs were selected. In 2010, 27 songs were selected by a selection panel, 4 songs were then selected by SVT in order to diversify the musical quality of the contest and one song was then selected through a "Web wildcard" competition. Members of the public were allowed to submit songs onto the SVT website, with the public selecting one song through SMS voting. For 2011, this was changed: only 15 songs were selected by the selection panel. The remaining 15 songs were then selected by SVT, from remaining submissions made to the selection panel, or from specially invited artists and songs. The web wildcard competition was expanded; instead of just one song was chosen, the public selected two songs.&lt;ref name="Sweden1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweden2" /&gt; The web wildcard competition began on 11 October, and ended with a live show on 8 November on [[SVT24]], held at the ''Golden Hits nightclub'' in Stockholm.&lt;ref name="webjoker1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=19993&amp;_t=Swedish+web+jokers+to+go+on+TV|title=Swedish web jokers to go on TV|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|date=9 September 2010|publisher=''Eurovision.tv''|accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webjoker2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Klier |first=Marcus |title=Sweden: Televised web joker selection on 8th November |url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/16107 |publisher=''ESCToday'' |accessdate=9 September 2010 |date=9 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911050743/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/16107 |archivedate=11 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webjoker3"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brunell |first=Lilian |title=Golden Hits hosts the wildcard selection |url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=9067 |publisher=''Oikotimes'' |accessdate=2 November 2010 |date=2 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229231302/http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=9067 |archivedate=29 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Other changes introduced to Melodifestivalen 2011 were revealed by SVT. For the first time, non-Swedish [[songwriter]]s were able to enter songs into the contest, as long as there is at least one Swedish songwriter also contributing. Solo singer-instrumentalists were now allowed to perform their instruments live during the TV broadcast.&lt;ref name="Sweden1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweden2" /&gt;

On 17 November, SVT announced [[Marie Serneholt]] and [[Rickard Olsson]] as the hosts for the semi-finals, the second chance and the final, but there was also a guest host in each program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.121594/1.2237287/marie_serneholt_och_rickard_olsson_leder_melodifestivalen_2011?lid=puff_2237276&amp;lpos=lasMer |title=Marie Serneholt och Rickard Olsson leder Melodifestivalen 2011 |date=17 November 2010 |publisher=''SVT'' |accessdate=17 November 2010 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612234504/http://svt.se/2.121594/1.2237287/marie_serneholt_och_rickard_olsson_leder_melodifestivalen_2011?lid=puff_2237276&amp;lpos=lasMer |archivedate=12 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/16240|title=Marie Serneholt and Rickard Olsson host Melodifestivalen 2011|last=Repo|first=Juha|date=17 November 2010|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* All entries were submitted via Melodifestivalen website instead of by post.
* The selection panel and SVT chose fifteen entries each, instead of the selection panel choosing twenty-seven and SVT four.
* Foreign songwriters could post entries, but only in combination with at least one Swedish author.
* Artists were able to play at least one instrument live on stage.
* In the regular selection process, it was the only established songwriters who could submit entries. The public were only allowed to submit entries to the web wildcard competition.
* As in previous years, the songs may be up to three minutes on stage, but a new rule is that they must be at least two minutes long.
* The whole voting in the final will be changed. The total value of the votes are 946 points, which means that tele-votes and jury-votes represent 50/50 each. If an entry is getting 10% of the tele-votes it will be equivalent to 47 points. The Swedish jury groups are replaced by 11 international groups. Each jury group gives their points according to the ESC-standard: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 points.  If two songs end up at the same position, the people’s votes will overrule the jury-votes.

==Entries==
32 songs competed in Melodifestivalen 2011. 15 of them were selected from a public call for songs, in which public songwriters and artists could send in songs to SVT, until 21 September 2010. The format for the contest remained the same from last year's, the same format that was introduced in 2002. The 32 songs were presented over 4 semi-finals. A public televote was held to select two songs to progress directly to the final, with the 3rd and 4th placed songs progressing to a Second Chance (''Andra Chansen'') round. The eight songs in the Second Chance round battled in duels until two songs are left, which also progress to the final. In the final, the votes of the public constituted 50% of the total vote, with the remaining 50% coming from the juries.

On 22 September, SVT announced that a record number of 3852 entries have been submitted. 424 of them were submitted to the web wildcard selection.&lt;ref name="Sweden4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/16142 |title=Sweden: Record numbers entering Melodifestivalen |last=Hondal |first=Victor |date=22 September 2010 |publisher=''Esctoday.com'' |accessdate=2010-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925235105/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/16142 |archivedate=25 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Web wildcards ===
From July to November 2010 SVT held the second Melodifestivalen web wildcard contest. From 9 July to 21 September musicians with no previous music contract could submit songs to the SVT Melodifestivalen website.

The remaining top four would battle again for a place in the final and ''Andra Chansen'' round - the 2nd placed song qualifying to the final, the 3rd and 4th placed songs progressing to Andra Chansen, and the song places fifth will be eliminated from the competition. However, SVT will not announce the vote result for each song until the final has been broadcast.

=== Second Chance ===
The Andra Chansen (''Second Chance'') round was held on 5 March in [[Nordichallen]], [[Sundsvall]]. Eight acts qualified for this round from the semi-finals - the songs that placed 3rd and 4th. A duel format was used, with each song battling against another in order to remain in the contest and qualify for the final on 12 March.

During the show, the on-screen graphics displayed the wrong phone numbers on the Radiohjälpen number during Duels 1, 2 and 3. SVT discounted all the votes to the Radiohjälpen number in these duels to declare the winning artist.&lt;ref name=votingscandal&gt;{{cite web|last=Waddell |first=Nathan |title=Results from Melodifestivalen 2011, Andra chansen, voting scandal resolved + running order for Finalen |url=http://escdaily.com/articles/15381 |publisher=escdaily |accessdate=6 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710201444/http://escdaily.com/articles/15381 |archivedate=10 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Melodifestivalen 2011 Results.png|thumb|right|230px|Official Results{{deletable image-caption|Friday, 22 April 2011}}]] --&gt;
The final of Melodifestivalen 2011 was held on 12 March 2011 at the Globe Arena in Stockholm. The two winners from each of the four semi-finals and the two ''Second chance'' winners qualified for the final, A total of 10 songs. The winner was decided by a mix of televoting/SMS voting and jury voting.

On 17 December 2010, Swedish newspaper ''[[Expressen]]'' announced that SVT planned to change the voting system in the Melodifestivalen Final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Folket förlorar makten i Melodifestivalen|url=http://www.expressen.se/noje/musik/1.2258372/folket-forlorar-makten-i-melodifestivalen|publisher=''Expressen''|accessdate=17 December 2010|language=Swedish|date=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 January 2011, SVT gave details about that. The value of the votes was 946 points, which meant that tele-votes and jury-votes represent 50/50 each. If an entry is getting 10% of the tele-votes, it would be equivalent to 47 points.

The Swedish jury groups were replaced by eleven international groups. Each jury group gave their points as follows: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 points.  If two songs end up at the same position, the people’s votes would overrule the jury-votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SWEDEN New voting rules in Melodifestivalen 2011 |url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=9555 |publisher=''Oikotimes.com'' |accessdate=10 January 2011 |date=10 January 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The running order for the Final was made immediately after the Second Chance round.&lt;ref name=votingscandal /&gt;

'''''Mortal Kombat: Live Tour''''' was a [[martial art]] [[theatre|theatrical]] stage show featuring ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' characters, sound, and [[Laser lighting display|laser light effects]] on stage. The plot was based on three fighters rescuing their friends and retrieving a magic [[amulet]] from the evil master of Outworld, [[Shao Kahn]], in order to save the Earth.

The show debuted at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in [[New York City]] on September 14, 1995, followed by a 200 city road trip into 1996. It replicated ''Mortal Kombat'' [[martial arts]] and [[video game]] moves on stage mixed with dancing and music. [[Lip synching]] were pre-recorded and used to demonstrate the official ''MK'' [[sound effects]], though there was no graphic violence or [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatalities]] visible in the show. The audience participated by yelling "Run!" or "Kick him!" as part of the live action.

==Production==
The lasers were produced by Laser Fantasy International of Seattle and operated by Dave Haskell and Chris Thornberry. A medium frame Spectra Physics and a 40 watt laser scope were used along with a custom fiber system for these effects. It was produced in part by "David Fishof Presents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidfishofpresents.com/ |title=David Fishof Presents |publisher=David Fishof Presents |date= |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/21420792.html?dids=21420792:21420792&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+24%2C+1995&amp;author=CHRIS+RIEMENSCHNEIDER&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=%60Kombat'+Set+to+Battle+New+Terrain-and+Critics&amp;pqatl=google |title=`Kombat' Set to Battle New Terrain-and Critics|author=Riemenschneider, Chris|publisher=Los Angeles Times|via=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=1995-08-24 |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hakim Alston (Jax) played an Outworld warrior who was defeated by [[Liu Kang]] ([[Robin Shou]]) in the original [[Mortal Kombat (film)|''MK'' movie]] a year earlier. Fight coordinator [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] also appeared in the movie as Shang Tsung.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4890">[[File:Richard Launcelot Maury.jpg|thumb|Richard Launcelot Maury, who developed the idea for the New Virginia Colony.]]
The '''New Virginia Colony''' was a colonization plan in central [[Mexico]], to resettle ex-[[Confederate States of America|Confederates]]&lt;ref&gt;Among those who "fled" to Mexico to save their lives from a revengeful Northern administration was [[Pendleton Murrah]], the recently-elected governor of Texas.&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[American Civil War]]. The largest settlement was Carlota, approximately midway between [[Mexico City]] and [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], although other settlements were planned near [[Tampico]], [[Monterrey]], [[Cuernavaca]], and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]].&lt;ref&gt;Andew Rolle, ''The Lost Cause: The Confederate Exodus to Mexico'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1965). {{ISBN|978-0-8061-1961-8}} (reprint, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

The venture was conceived by Commodore [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]]. Because of his work for the [[Confederate Secret Service]], Maury was unable to return home to [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lee Lewis, ''Matthew Fontaine Maury: The Pathfinder of the Seas'' (U.S. Naval Institute, 1927). {{ISBN|1-4366-7917-6}} (reprint, Kessinger Publishing, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Maury, as an internationally famous [[oceanographer]] and navy man, was a long-time friend of Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]] of Mexico and had been awarded a medal by Maximilian before the Civil War. Maximilian had also been head of the [[Austrian Navy]] and awarded Maury the medal for his work in oceanography.

Maximilian liked Maury and his idea of inviting Confederates and anyone else to resettle in Mexico and offered land grants to any who would come and stay. Slavery was banned in Mexican law however, so no settler could bring slaves into Mexico. He was also eagerly seeking settlers from [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[France]], as part of his strategy to rebuild and Europeanize Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Ridley, ''Maximilian and Juarez'' (Ticknor &amp; Fields, 1992). {{ISBN|1-84212-150-2}} (reprint, Phoenix Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Maury explained a network of planned settlements to Maximilian, who liked what was heard. They were to be primarily in the agricultural regions surrounding Mexico City but also in the northern areas around Monterrey and Chihuahua. American "colonization agents" were appointed to districts, and Maury began to prepare surveys for the proposed colonies. One of Maury's colleagues was explorer and archeologist [[William Marshall Anderson]], whose brother, U.S. Brevet Major General [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]], had commanded the Union soldiers at [[Fort Sumter]]. Two others had worked under Maury when he was the superintendent of the [[U.S. Naval Observatory]]. His eldest son, Col. Richard Launcelot Maury, had also emigrated to Mexico. Maury had plans for his entire family to eventually move there to a colony. Virginia was war-torn: "back to what? To poverty and misery . . ." declared Maury in a September 1865 letter. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite wikisource

Confederate generals such as Fighting [[Jo Shelby]], [[Edmund Kirby Smith]], [[John B. Magruder]], [[Sterling Price]], [[Thomas C. Hindman]], and [[Alexander W. Terrell]] made their way to Mexico after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Rolle, ''The Lost Cause''. Also see, ''An American in Maximilian's Mexico 1865-1866'' by [[William Marshall Anderson]], who was using the trip as an archeological expedition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the period, Maximilian's regime was under attack by Republican leaders [[Benito Juárez]] and [[Porfirio Díaz]]. From 1865 onward, Juárez and Díaz were covertly supplied from a US Army depot in [[El Paso, Texas]]. In 1866, [[Napoleon III]] withdrew the French troops that had been supporting Maximilian.&lt;ref&gt;Richard O'Connor, ''The Cactus Throne: The Tragedy of Maximilian and Carlotta'' (Putnam, 1971). {{ISBN|0-380-00641-3}} (reprint, Avon, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

When the French withdrew from Carlota in March 1867, the area was overrun by the forces of Juárez and the remaining New Virginia colonists fled the area. The New Virginia settlements were abandoned as the anti-Maximilian forces reached them. The survivors generally moved toward the coast. The imperial government collapsed in May 1867 and most of the settlers left Mexico.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22894">An '''occupational injury''' is bodily damage resulting from working. The most common [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s involved are the [[vertebral column|spine]], [[hand]]s, the [[Human head|head]], [[human lung|lung]]s, [[human eye|eye]]s, [[human skeleton|skeleton]], and [[human skin|skin]]. Occupational injuries can result from exposure to [[occupational hazard]]s ([[Physical hazard|physical]], [[Chemical hazard|chemical]], [[Biological hazard|biological]], or [[Psychosocial hazard|psychosocial]]), such as [[temperature]], [[noise]], [[Insect bites and stings|insect]] or [[animal bite]]s, [[Blood-borne disease|blood-borne pathogens]], [[aerosol]]s, [[Dangerous goods|hazardous chemicals]], [[radiation]], and [[occupational burnout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hazards.html|title=Hazards &amp; Exposures|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many prevention methods are set in place, injuries may still occur due to poor [[ergonomics]], [[manual handling]] of heavy loads, misuse or failure of equipment, exposure to general hazards, and inadequate safety training.

==Worldwide==
It has been estimated that worldwide there are more than 350,000 workplace fatalities and more than 270 million workplace injuries annually.&lt;ref&gt;Barling, J., &amp; Frone, M. R. (2004). Occupational injuries: Setting the stage. In J. Barling &amp; M. R. Frone (Eds.), The psychology of workplace safety. Washington, DC: APA.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 there were approximately 2.9 billion workers worldwide. Occupational injuries resulted in the loss of 3.5 years of healthy life for every 1,000 workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Concha-Barrientos|first=Marisol|last2=Nelson|first2=Deborah Imel|last3=Fingerhut|first3=Marilyn|last4=Driscoll|first4=Timothy|last5=Leigh|first5=James|date=2005-12-01|title=The global burden due to occupational injury|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|volume=48|issue=6|pages=470–481|doi=10.1002/ajim.20226|issn=0271-3586|pmid=16299709}}&lt;/ref&gt; 300,000 of the occupational injuries resulted in a fatality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takala|first=Jukka|last2=Hämäläinen|first2=Päivi|last3=Saarela|first3=Kaija Leena|last4=Yun|first4=Loke Yoke|last5=Manickam|first5=Kathiresan|last6=Jin|first6=Tan Wee|last7=Heng|first7=Peggy|last8=Tjong|first8=Caleb|last9=Kheng|first9=Lim Guan|date=2014-01-01|title=Global estimates of the burden of injury and illness at work in 2012|journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|volume=11|issue=5|pages=326–337|doi=10.1080/15459624.2013.863131|issn=1545-9632|pmc=4003859|pmid=24219404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==
===United States===
In the United States in 2012, 4,383 workers died from job injuries, 92% of which were men,&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. "Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries Charts, 1992-2012."&lt;/ref&gt; and nearly 3 million nonfatal workplace injuries &amp; illness were reported which cost businesses a collective loss of $198.2 billion and 60 million workdays.&lt;ref name="workplace-safety-by-the-numbers"&gt;[http://www.prudentialuniforms.com/blog/uniforms-and-apparel/workplace-safety-by-the-numbers Workplace Safety By The Numbers] - "U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics"&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, 5,488 workers died from job injuries, 92% of which were men,&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. "National census of fatal occupational injuries in 2007." Washington, DC: US Department of Labor; 2008. Retrieved at: [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/about.html About NIOSH]. Available at [http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cfoi.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; and 49,000 died from work-related injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Steenland K, Burnett C, Lalich N, Ward E, Hurrell J. Dying for work: the magnitude of U.S. mortality from selected causes of death associated with occupation. Am J Ind Med 2003;43:461--82.

Available at [http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/osh.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data from the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) and the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], an average of 15 workers die from traumatic injuries each day in the United States, and an additional 200 workers are hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/injury/|title=Traumatic Occupational Injuries|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study in the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], injured workers were followed for 14 years to determine the long term effects of work injury on employment. The work injuries resulted in an average of 1.06 years of lost productivity for each of the 31,588 allowed claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fulton-Kehoe|first=D.|last2=Franklin|first2=G.|last3=Weaver|first3=M.|last4=Cheadle|first4=A.|date=2000-06-01|title=Years of productivity lost among injured workers in Washington state: modeling disability burden in workers' compensation|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|volume=37|issue=6|pages=656–662|issn=0271-3586|pmid=10797509|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-0274(200006)37:6&lt;656::aid-ajim10&gt;3.0.co;2-c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dangerous sectors====
In the U.S. the Bureau of Labor Statistics makes available extensive statistics on workplace accidents and injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/iif|title=Injuries, Illnesses, and Fatalities|website=www.bls.gov|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

[[File:BLS US fatalities by industry 2010.png]]
[[File:BLS US fatal injuries by occupation 2010.png]]

====Common injuries====
As in the United Kingdom, slips, trips and falls are common and account for 20-40% of disabling occupational injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Courtney|first=T. K.|last2=Sorock|first2=G. S.|last3=Manning|first3=D. P.|last4=Collins|first4=J. W.|last5=Holbein-Jenny|first5=M.

In the United States, a high risk of [[Back injury|back injuries]] occurs in the [[Healthcare industry|health care industry]]. 25% of reported injuries in health care workers in the state of Pennsylvania are for back pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haladay|first=Douglas E.|last2=Blorstad|first2=Amanda L.|last3=McBrier|first3=Nicole M.|last4=Denegar|first4=Craig R.|last5=Lengerich|first5=Eugene J.|date=2012-01-01|title=Back pain among health care workers in Pennsylvania 2002-2006|journal=Work (Reading, Mass.)|volume=41|issue=1|pages=93–98|doi=10.3233/WOR-2012-1288|issn=1875-9270|pmid=22246309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[Nursing|nurses]], the prevalence of lower back pain may be as high as 72% mostly as a result of transferring patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schlossmacher|first=Roberta|last2=Amaral|first2=Fernando Gonçalves|date=2012-01-01|title=Low back injuries related to nursing professionals working conditions: a systematic review|journal=Work (Reading, Mass.)|volume=41 Suppl 1|pages=5737–5738|doi=10.3233/WOR-2012-0935-5737|issn=1875-9270|pmid=22317669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these injuries can be prevented with the availability of [[patient lift]]s, improved worker training, and allocation of more time to perform work procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D'Arcy|first=Laura P.|last2=Sasai|first2=Yasuko|last3=Stearns|first3=Sally C.|date=2012-04-01|title=Do assistive devices, training, and workload affect injury incidence?

Studies on a cohort of newly hired workers have thus far identified forceful gripping, repetitive lifting of &gt; 1&amp;nbsp;kg, and using vibrating power tools as high risk work activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evanoff|first=Bradley|last2=Dale|first2=Ann Marie|last3=Deych|first3=Elena|last4=Ryan|first4=Daniel|last5=Franzblau|first5=Alfred|date=2012-01-01|title=Risk factors for incident carpal tunnel syndrome: results of a prospective cohort study of newly-hired workers|journal=Work (Reading, Mass.)|volume=41 Suppl 1|pages=4450–4452|doi=10.3233/WOR-2012-0745-4450|issn=1875-9270|pmc=3752891|pmid=22317405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, noise exposure in the workplace can cause [[hearing loss]], which accounted for 14% of reported occupational illnesses in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/stats.html|title=Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many initiatives have been created to prevent this common workplace injury. For example, the [[Buy Quiet]] program encourages employers to purchase tools and machines that produce less noise and the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]] was created to recognize companies and program that excel in the area of hearing loss prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/|title=Buy Quiet|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeinsound.us/|title=Safe•in•Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award|website=www.safeinsound.us|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accidental injection or needlestick injuries are a common injury that plague agriculture workers and veterinarians. The majority of these injuries are located to the hands or legs, and can result in mild to severe reactions, including possible hospitalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buswell|first=ML.|last2=Hourigan|first2=M.|date=2015|title=Needlestick Injuries in Agriculture Workers and Prevention Programs|url=http://umash.umn.edu/publications/product/needlestick-injuries-ag-workers-prevention-programs/?|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|volume=21|issue=1|doi=10.1080/1059924X.2015.1106996|pmid=26478987|access-date=1 August 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the wide variety of biologics used in animal agriculture, needlestick injuries can result in bacterial or fungal infections, lacerations, local inflammation, vaccine/antibiotic reactions, amputations, miscarriage, and death.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buswell|first=M.|last2=Hourigan|first2=M.|date=9 June 2014|title=Needlestick Injuries in Livestock Workers and Prevention Programs|url=http://umash.umn.edu/publications/product/needlestick-injuries-livestock-workers-prevention-programs/?|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|volume=19|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=1 August 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to daily human-animal interactions, livestock related injuries are also a prevalent injury of agriculture workers, and are responsible for the majoriy of nonfatal worker injuries on dairy farms. Additionally, approximately 30 people die of cattle and horse-related deaths in the United States annually.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorge|first=U.S.|last2=Cherry|first2=C.|date=July 2014|title=Perception of the importance of human-animal interactions on cattle flow and worker safety on Minnesota dairy farms.|journal=Journal of Dairy Science|volume=97|issue=7|doi=10.3168/jds.2014-7971|pmid=24835968|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Employees at risk====
Perhaps the most important personal factor that predisposes to an increased risk is age.

Lack of proper education or training can also predispose an individual to an occupational injury. For example, there is limited needlestick injury awareness among agriculture workers, and there is a need for comprehensive programs to prevent needlestick injuries on livestock operations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Proper animal handling techniques and training, or stockmanship, can also decrease the risk of livestock injury. A handler's timing, positioning, speed, direction of movement, and sounds made will affect the behavior of an animal and consequently the safety of the handler.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The agriculture industry has begun to focus more on proper education and training, and has made a variety of resources available to producers. For example, organizations like the Upper Midwest Agriculture Safety and Health Center [http://www.umash.umn.edu (UMASH)] have a variety of informational fact sheets and training videos easily accessible online. Additionally, organizations like Beef Quality Assurance offers stockmanship training seminars and demonstrations.

====Regulation====
In the United States, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) sets and enforces national standards for occupational safety across all sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/about.html|title=About OSHA|website=United States Department of Labor|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom in 2013/2014, 133 people were killed at work. Of those 133 people, 89 were employed, while 44 were self-employed. In 2013/2014, an estimated 629,000 injuries occurred at work. Of these injuries 629,000 injuries, 203,000 led to more than 3 days absence from work. Of these, over 148,000 resulted in the victim being absent from work for more than 7 days.&lt;ref name="kentcompensation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kentcompensation.com/types-of-accident/accidents-at-work|title=Accident at Work Claims in Kent {{!}} Kent Compensation|website=www.kentcompensation.com|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dangerous sectors====
* Construction: 42 deaths&lt;ref name="kentcompensation"/&gt;
* Agriculture: 27 deaths&lt;ref name="kentcompensation"/&gt;
* Waste and Recycling: four deaths&lt;ref name="kentcompensation"/&gt;
* Other: 60 deaths

Of all the workplace accidents that resulted in death, the most common were falls from height, contact with moving machinery and being struck by a vehicle. These types of accidents resulted in over half of all recorded deaths.&lt;ref name="kentcompensation"/&gt;

====Common injuries====
Slips, trips and falls account for over a third of all injuries that happen at work. Incorrect handling of items was the most common cause of injuries that led to absences from work of more than 7 days.&lt;ref name="kentcompensation"/&gt; Upper limb injuries represented 47.3% of workplace injuries in 2010-2011, the most common area injured.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In all, over 1,900,000 working days were lost in 2013/2014 due to slips, trips and falls.&lt;ref name="kentcompensation"/&gt;

====Employees at risk====
Unsurprisingly, occupation is the biggest influence on the risk of workplace injuries. Workers new to the job are at a much higher risk of injury than more experienced staff, while shift workers and part-time staff also have a greater risk of being injured at work.&lt;ref name="kentcompensation"/&gt;

====Employer prosecutions====
The Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE) prosecuted 582 cases in 2013/2014, with at least one conviction secured in 547 cases (94%).&lt;ref name="kentcompensation"/&gt;

Local authorities prosecuted a total of 92 cases during the same period, with at least one conviction achieved in 89 cases (97%).&lt;ref name="kentcompensation"/&gt;

A total of 13,790 notices were issued by the HSE and local authorities, with over £16,700,000 issued in fines.&lt;ref name="kentcompensation"/&gt;

===Taiwan===
In [[Taiwan]], there were 14,261 occupational injuries recorded in 2010. 45% of these involved trauma to the upper limbs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Vocational rehabilitation for enhancing return-to-work in workers with traumatic upper limb injuries|journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date = 2013|issn = 1469-493X|pmid = 24122624|pages = CD010002|volume = 10|doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010002.pub2|first = Wen-Hsuan|last = Hou|first2 = Ching-Chi|last2 = Chi|first3 = Heng-Lien Daniel|last3 = Lo|first4 = Ken N.|last4 = Kuo|first5 = Hung-Yi|last5 = Chuang}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29210462|date = July 2018}}

==Prevention==
There are many methods of preventing or reducing industrial injuries, including anticipation of problems by [[risk assessment]], safety training, [[control banding]], [[personal protective equipment]] safety guards, mechanisms on machinery, and safety barriers. In addition, past problems can be analyzed to find their [[root cause]]s by using a technique called [[root cause analysis]]. A 2013 Cochrane review found low-quality evidence showing that inspections, especially focused inspections, can reduce work-related injuries in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mischke|first=Christina|last2=Verbeek|first2=Jos H.|last3=Job|first3=Jenny|last4=Morata|first4=Thais C.|last5=Alvesalo-Kuusi|first5=Anne|last6=Neuvonen|first6=Kaisa|last7=Clarke|first7=Simon|last8=Pedlow|first8=Robert I.|date=2013|title=Occupational safety and health enforcement tools for preventing occupational diseases and injuries|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=8|pages=CD010183|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010183.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=23996220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plymouth''' was the [[Capital (political)|capital]] city of the island of [[Montserrat]], an [[British Overseas Territories|overseas territory]] of the [[United Kingdom]] located in the [[Leeward Island]] chain of the [[Lesser Antilles]], [[West Indies]]. Constructed on historical lava deposits near the then-inactive [[Soufriere Hills volcano]], the town was evacuated when the volcano resumed erupting in 1995. Plymouth was abandoned permanently in 1997 after it was burnt and mostly buried by a series of [[pyroclastic flows]] and [[lahar]]s. For centuries, it had been the only port of entry to the island.

Plymouth is still the ''[[de jure]]'' capital city of Montserrat, making it the only [[ghost town]] that serves as the capital of a political territory.

==History==

===Volcano and abandonment===
[[File:Montserrat Plymouth Street Lamp.png|thumb|left|Ash piled as high as a streetlamp on the streets of Plymouth (1999)]]
[[File:Montserrat eruption.JPG|thumb|left|By 12 July 1997, [[pyroclastic flow]]s had burned much of what had not already been covered in ash]]
Beginning in July 1995, a series of huge eruptions at the [[Soufrière Hills volcano]] sent [[pyroclastic flows]] and ash falls across a wide area of southern Montserrat including the capital, Plymouth. It was immediately clear that the town was in grave danger. On 21 August 1995, [[tephra]] fell on Plymouth, and in December residents were evacuated as a precaution. 
Residents were allowed back a few months later, but on 25 June 1997, a massive eruption produced [[pyroclastic surge]]s that killed 19 people and reached nearly to the island's airport on the eastern side of the island. Plymouth was again evacuated.

Between 4–8 August a further series of large eruptions destroyed approximately 80% of the town, burying it under {{convert|1.4|m|ft|1}} of ash. This hot material burned many of the buildings, making habitation nearly impossible for many of the residents.

The pyroclastic flows, lava, ash and other volcanic rock types were mostly compact, having a density similar to that of concrete. The removal of the overburden would have required the use of explosives, bulldozers and other resources too expensive for widespread use. It was anticipated that the soil underneath the hardened mud and lava would have been scorched and left completely non-arable by the heat of the pyroclastic flows. Plymouth was abandoned and the entire southern half of the island was declared an [[exclusion zone]] because of the continuing volcanic activity at the Soufrière Hills. The government of the island was moved to [[Brades, Montserrat|Brades]], although Plymouth remains the ''[[de jure]]'' capital. {{As of|2013}}, a new port and capital are under construction at [[Little Bay, Montserrat|Little Bay]], on the island's northwest coast.

The destruction of Plymouth caused severe economic problems for the island of Montserrat. Plymouth had been by far the largest settlement on the island, with around 4,000 inhabitants. It had been the site of almost all the island's shops and services, in addition to having been its seat of government. Some of the lost facilities were subsequently rebuilt elsewhere on Montserrat, but this did not prevent emigration. More than two-thirds of the island's population was evacuated by the [[Royal Navy]]. Most of the evacuees have not returned.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

This is a partial list of notable '''[[price fixing]] and [[bid rigging]] cases'''.

==US==
A federal district court in February 1961 fined 29 electrical manufacturing companies and 45 individuals a total of $1,924,500 for violating the [[antitrust laws]] by fixing prices and rigging bids on heavy electrical equipment, some of which was sold to the Government.&lt;ref&gt;CQ almanac [http://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/document.php?id=cqal61-879-29203-1371699 Electrical Price Fixing Stirs Inquiry]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air travel===
On 1 August 2007 it was reported that [[British Airways]] has been fined £121.5 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title =  BA gets £121.5m price-fixing fine| publisher = BBC News | date = 8 January 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6925397.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; for price-fixing. The fine was imposed by the [[Office of Fair Trading]] (OFT) after BA admitted to the price-fixing of fuel surcharges on long haul flights. The allegation first came to light in 2006 when [[Virgin Atlantic Airways|Virgin Atlantic]] reported the events to the authorities after it found staff members from BA and [[Virgin Atlantic]] were colluding. Virgin Atlantic have since been granted immunity by both the OFT and the [[United States Department of Justice]] who have been investigating the allegations since June 2006. The US DOJ later announced that it would fine British Airways [[$]]300 million (£148 million) for price fixing.

The allegations are thought to be linked to the resignation of commercial director Martin George and communications chief Iain Burns. Although BA said fuel surcharges were "a legitimate way of recovering costs", in May 2007 it put aside £350 million for legal fees and fines.

===Beer===
On 18 April 2007 The [[European commission]] imposed fines on [[Heineken]]  €219.3m, [[Grolsch]] €31.65m and [[Bavaria Brewery (Netherlands)|Bavaria]]  €22.85m for operating a [[cartel|price fixing cartel]] in the [[Netherlands]], totalling €273.7m. [[InBev]], (formerly [[Interbrew]]), escaped without a penalty because it provided "decisive information" about the cartel which operated between 1996 and 1999 and others in the EU market. The brewers controlled 95% of the Dutch market, with [[Heineken]] claiming a half and the three others 15% each.&lt;ref name = 'beer'&gt;{{cite news | first= David| last= Gow| coauthors= | title=Heineken and Grolsch fined for price-fixing | date= 18 April 2007| publisher= | url =http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2059542,00.html | work =[[The Guardian]] | pages = | accessdate = 1 August 2007 | language = | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neelie Kroes]] said she was "very disappointed" that the collusion took place at the very highest (boardroom) level. She added, [[Heineken]], [[Grolsch]], [[Bavaria]] and [[InBev]] tried to cover their tracks by using code names and abbreviations for secret meetings to carve up the market for beer sold to [[supermarkets]], [[hotels]], [[restaurants]] and [[cafes]]. The [[price fixing]] extended to cheaper [[Store brand|own-brand]] labels and [[Rebate (marketing)|rebates]] for [[Bar (establishment)|bars]].&lt;ref name = 'beer'/&gt;

{{quote|This is simply unacceptable: that major beer suppliers colluded to up prices and to carve up markets among themselves.&lt;ref name = 'beer' /&gt;|[[EU Competition Commissioner]] [[Neelie Kroes]]}}

In December 2001 Interbrew, [[Danone]] (former owner of Kronenbourg), and two other smaller brewers were fined €91m for operating a cartel in [[Belgium]] while four Luxembourg companies were fined €448,000 the same month.&lt;ref name = 'beer' /&gt;

In 2004, [[Heineken]] and [[Kronenbourg]], the two dominant brewers in France, were fined €2.5m - with the penalty reduced for co-operating. A similar inquiry into an alleged Italian cartel was closed without proceedings while the British and German beer markets were specifically excluded.&lt;ref name = 'beer' /&gt;

===Switchgear===

In January 2007 [[Siemens]] was fined €396 million over its role in a [[collusion]] scandal. The [[European Commission]] handed out a massive €750 million in fines to Siemens, [[Alstom]], [[Areva]], [[Schneider Electric]] and Japanese firms [[Fuji Electric]], [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]], [[Mitsubishi Electric]], [[Toshiba]] and [[Japan AE Systems]]. Switzerland's [[ABB Group]] was a [[whistleblower]] and escaped without any fine from the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Vote call by Siemens shareholders  | date= 25 January 2007| publisher= | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6296985.stm | work =[[BBC]] | pages = | accessdate = 1 August 2007 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulators found that the companies [[bid rigging|rigged bids for contracts]] and [[price fixing|fixed prices]] in the market for [[Switchgear|gas-insulated switchgear]] - equipment is used to control the flow of energy in electricity grids. Siemens' fine was the biggest of the companies involved because it was a ringleader, the Commission said. About 30 business premises and private homes were searched as part of the investigation.

The cartel swapped information on offers from customers and operated a quota system for the division of work. Bids were rigged so that tenders went to whichever firm was due work under the quota system. "Code names were used for both companies and individuals. They relied on anonymous email addresses for communication and used [[encryption]] for sending messages," said the Commission.&lt;ref name=out-law&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Siemens hit with €396 million price fixing fine | date= | publisher= | url=http://www.out-law.com/page-7701 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 1 August 2007 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The General Court reduces the fines of certain members of the gas insulated switchgear cartel |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_CJE-11-5_en.pdf |format=PDF |location=Luxembourg |publisher=General Court of the European Union |agency= |date=3 March 2011 |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"The commission has put an end to a [[cartel]] which has cheated [[public utility]] companies and consumers for more than 16 years," said EU Competition Commissioner [[Neelie Kroes]].&lt;ref name=out-law/&gt;

==France==
In 2005,  [[Orange France]], [[SFR]] and [[Bouygues Telecom]] were found guilty and fined €534m for engaging in anti-competitive practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twobirds.com/en/news/articles/2006/french-cc-fine-mobile |title=French Competition Council imposes new record fine for mobile phone operators |publisher=Bird &amp; Bird |date=13 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Autorité de la concurrence]] handed out fines to [[Colgate-Palmolive]], [[Henkel]], [[Unilever]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Reckitt Benckiser]], [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]], [[SC Johnson]], Bolton Solitaire], [[Groupe Vendôme SA]], [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]], [[L'Oreal]], [[Beiersdorf]] and Vania totalling €948.9million in 2016 for price-fixing on personal hygiene products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.connexionfrance.com/court-appeal-price-fixing-fine-upheld-consumer-companies-gillette-loreal-procter-gamble-sc-johnson-18567-view-article.html |title=Huge price-fixing fine is upheld |publisher=The Connexion |date=28 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170209165431/http://www.connexionfrance.com/court-appeal-price-fixing-fine-upheld-consumer-companies-gillette-loreal-procter-gamble-sc-johnson-18567-view-article.html |archivedate=9 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dairy products===
On 7 December 2007, [[Sainsbury's]], [[Asda]], [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]], [[Dairy Crest]], [[Robert Wiseman Dairies]] and [[The Cheese Company]] have all admitted that they had secretly swapped information with each other to make shoppers pay more for milk and cheese in a £270m [[price-fixing]] conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=427337&amp;in_page_id=2&amp;ito=1565|title=Supermarkets fined £116m for price-fixing|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartel agreed in principle with the [[Office of Fair Trading]] that they conspired against the interests of consumers. In their defense, the corporations have publicly said they had been under pressure to help farmers hit by [[foot-and-mouth]], however, the OFT said "I think it is reasonable to say we don't doubt the purpose initially was to pass money back to farmers but, in general, there is no evidence that [[farm gate price]] increased as a result of the initiative. We don't know what happened to the money."

All the major UK store chains, with the exception of [[Waitrose]] and [[Marks &amp; Spencer]], are embroiled in the OFT inquiry into [[milk]] prices in 2002 and 2003 which has been ongoing since the beginning of 2004. It was accepted by [[Asda]], Sainsbury and Safeway that stores increased the price of milk as a result of collusion. [[Dairy Crest]] and [[Robert Wiseman Dairies|Wiseman]] allegedly acted as middle men, passing on sensitive information about prices to their supposed rivals. Britain's biggest store chain [[Tesco]], and [[Morrisons]], are accused of collusion too, but vigorously deny they took part. The allegations against Tesco involve [[cheese]] as well as [[milk]] and [[butter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/07/supermarkets?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront|title=OFT hands out £116m in fines for milk price fixing|first1=Fiona|last1=Walsh|first2=business|last2=editor|date=7 December 2007|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the OFT proves its case, the retailers could theoretically face fines of up to 10 per cent of their worldwide turnover, which in Tesco's case would amount to £4.3bn. The Office of Fair Trading told Sainsbury's, Asda, Safeway, Dairy Crest, Wiseman and The Cheese Company they faced maximum fines of £116m, though the final figure may be as low as £80m as a result of their co-operation. [[Sainsbury's]] told the [[London Stock Exchange]] that its fine was £26m. The fine for [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]] is thought to be between £8m and £10m; £9m for [[Dairy Crest]] and £6m for [[Robert Wiseman Dairies|Robert Wiseman]]. It is unclear who blew the whistle on the price-fixing but [[Arla Foods|Arla]], the dairy processor, will escape a fine after fully co-operating with authorities. Consumer advocate [[Which?]] Ltd complained that, despite overpaying £270m, [[consumer]]s would not receive any refunds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article3233342.ece|title=Milked! Supermarkets admit secret price-fixing|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706145752/http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article3233342.ece|archivedate=6 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
In April 2008, The [[Office of Fair Trading]] named 112 companies that it says colluded to inflate the cost of a wide range of contracts worth billions of pounds, including tenders for schools, universities and hospitals.&lt;ref name='building'/&gt;

The list includes several publicly listed companies, including [[Balfour Beatty]], [[Kier Group]] and [[Carillion]], with 80 of the firms have already admitted participating in some form of bid-rigging, or have applied for leniency in return for assisting the OFT. The allegations centre around "cover pricing", in which firms secretly agreed the prices they would submit during a tender process. A firm that did not want to win the contract would submit a price that was much too high. In some cases, the eventual successful bidder would then reward them with a secret payment. This bid rigging often involved false invoices. The OFT declined to comment on the value of the fraud.&lt;ref name='building'&gt;[http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2008/52-08 OFT issues statement of objections against 112 construction companies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420231329/http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2008/52-08 |date=20 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial===
In April 2003, The London office of [[ABN Amro]] was fined £900,000 for helping a US client, Oechsle International Advisers, to rig share prices. The fine was the [[Financial Services Authority|FSA]]'s fifth biggest, and is the largest involving market abuse on the [[London Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name='abm'/&gt;

ABN's then joint head of the UK equity trading desk, Michael Ackers, has been fined £70,000 for "market misconduct." The FSA decided that traders in ABN Amro Equities (UK), known as AAE, "accepted improper instructions whose apparent purpose was to push the closing market price of certain shares to a higher level than would otherwise have been the case". This happened on three separate occasions between April and October 1998 in respect of shares in Carlton Communications, British Biotech, Volkswagen and Metro. Angelo Iannone, the head of ABN's international sales trading desk in New York, had had a long-standing relationship with Oechsle and one of its fund managers, Andrew Parlin. They agreed to increase the price of the shares in question at the end of certain days' trading, to make the prices look better in clients' portfolios.&lt;ref name='abm'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/abn-fined-pound900000-for-price-rigging-595508.html|title=US|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}On 16 June 2012, during the setup at Toronto's [[Downsview Park]] for the final concert of [[Radiohead|Radiohead's]] North American tour, the roof of the temporary stage collapsed, killing drum technician Scott Johnson and injuring three others. Radiohead and artists including [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[White Lies (band)|White Lies]], [[Dan Snaith|Caribou]], and [[Elton John]] offered tributes and condolences.

In June 2013, [[Live Nation]] Canada Inc, two other organisations and an engineer were charged with 13 charges under Ontario health and safety laws. The hearing began in June 2015, but a mistrial was declared after the judge was appointed to [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice|Ontario Superior Court]] and lost [[jurisdiction]]. The case was dropped in September 2017 under the [[R v Jordan (2016)|Jordan ruling]], which puts time limits on cases. Radiohead condemned the decision. The chief coroner of Ontario is due to hold an inquest into Johnson's death.

== Collapse ==
On 16 June 2012, the English [[alternative rock]] band [[Radiohead]] were due to perform the final concert of their 2012 North American tour in support of their eighth album, ''[[The King of Limbs]]'', in [[Downsview Park]], Toronto.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The tour had extensive visual components and required 11 trucks to transport its equipment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Radiohead were due to have been on stage for the [[soundcheck]], but construction of the temporary stage was behind schedule.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/music/article-radioheads-return-to-toronto-why-theyre-still-angry-about-the-fatal/|title=Radiohead’s return to Toronto: Why they’re still angry about the fatal stage collapse that nearly caused them to call it quits|last=Dekel|first=Jonathan|date=16 July 2018|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|access-date=18 July 2018|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band was sequestered nearby while their [[road crew]] prepared equipment.&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/radiohead-drum-technician-death-1.4422702|title='I feel so let down by Canada': Radiohead and drum tech's parents demand answers in his Toronto death|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weather was calm, with light winds forecast.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2012/06/17/toronto-stage-collapse.html|title=Radiohead 'shattered' by crew member's death|date=17 June 2012|accessdate=21 June 2012|publisher=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 2pm, Radiohead’s business manager Ade Bullock noticed that scaffolding on the stage appeared to be drooping, and took a photograph, but thought: "What do I know about engineering?"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

At 4pm, an hour before the gates were due to open to concertgoers, the roof of the stage collapsed. Drummer [[Philip Selway]] recalled a sound "like an enormous cabinet of glasses falling over".&lt;ref name=":142" /&gt; Drum technician Scott Johnson was killed instantly by a falling video monitor weighing 2,270 kilograms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Three other members of Radiohead's crew were injured, one seriously.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18474835|title=Radiohead stage collapse 'kills one' in Canada|work=BBC News|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's light show and much of their musical equipment was also destroyed. The concert was cancelled and Radiohead's tour dates in Europe were postponed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2012/06/21/toronto-radiohead-concerts-postponed-after-stage-collapse.html|title=Radiohead postpones more shows after stage collapse|last=|first=|date=21 June 2012|work=|accessdate=21 June 2012|publisher=[[CBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Radiohead considered abandoning touring after the collapse. Selway said: "When we came away, it was, 'God, do we want to do this ever again?’ If it causes this, ''can'' we do it?"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They decided to continue the tour as a way of "working through the trauma".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At a vigil before their next performance three weeks later, Radiohead offered their crew the chance to leave without judgment; all chose to stay.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Tributes ==
Johnson, 33, from [[Doncaster]], South Yorkshire, had worked with acts including [[Robyn]], the [[The Killers|Killers]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]] and [[White Lies (band)|White Lies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-18479402|title=Radiohead stage fall victim named|last=|first=|date=18 June 2012|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=30 November 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1310-waiting-on-justice-for-the-radiohead-stage-collapse-that-killed-scott-johnson/|title=Waiting on Justice for the Radiohead Stage Collapse That Killed Scott Johnson|last=Marc|first=Hogan|date=3 October 2016|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the collapse, Selway wrote on Radiohead's website: "We have all been shattered by the loss of Scott Johnson, our friend and colleague. He was a lovely man, always positive, supportive and funny; a highly skilled and valued member of our great road crew. We will miss him very much. Our thoughts and love are with Scott's family and all those close to him."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tributes came from artists including Keane,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/keane-2-8-1276675|title=Keane pay tribute to Radiohead drum technician after stage collapse - NME|date=2012-06-18|work=NME|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; White Lies, and [[Dan Snaith|Caribou]], the Canadian band set to open for Radiohead.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Elton John]] called Johnson's family to offer his condolences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

All of Radiohead and their road crew attended Johnson's funeral.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In July, Radiohead paid tribute to Johnson at their first concert after the collapse, in [[Nîmes]], France, performing their single "[[Reckoner]]" as an [[encore]] while screens showed images of Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/radiohead-honor-late-drum-tech-at-first-show-since-stage-collapse-20120711|title=Radiohead Honor Late Drum Tech at First Show Since Stage Collapse &amp;#124; Music News|author=Rolling Stone|date=11 July 2012|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selway's second solo album, ''[[Weatherhouse (album)|Weatherhouse]]'' (2014), and Radiohead's ninth album, ''[[A Moon Shaped Pool]]'' (2016)'','' are dedicated to Johnson.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Johnson's parents used royalties from Keane's charity EP ''Upstairs At United - Vol. 5'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/carly-wilford/keane-recording_b_1932495.html|title=Exclusive - Keane Go Analogue For Legendary United Record Pressing in Nashville|date=2012-10-04|work=HuffPost UK|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with almost £3500 raised by Radiohead fans and £1200 of church and family donations, to create the Scott Johnson Bursary Fund. The fund distributes [[drum kit]]s to schools and teachers with help from [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] and the music shop where Johnson once worked. In 2015, Selway, [[Stephen Morris (musician)|Stephen Morris]] of [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and [[Guy Garvey]] of [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]] presented a drum kit in Johnson's honour to the [[Manchester Central Library]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Case ==
''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' described the collapse as part of a "sad streak of stage-related accidents", such as the 2011 [[Indiana State Fair stage collapse]], that had prompted "industry soul-searching".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In June 2013, after a year-long investigation, the [[Ministry of Labour (Ontario)|Ontario Ministry of Labour]] charged [[Live Nation]] Canada Inc, Live Nation Ontario Concerts GP Inc, Optex Staging &amp; Services Inc and the engineer who designed the stage, Domenic Cugliari, with 13 charges under Ontario health and safety laws.&lt;ref name=":142" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2013/06/07/toronto-live-nation-ontario-ministry-of-labour-optex.html|title=Live Nation, engineer charged in Radiohead stage collapse|date=7 June 2013|work=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutor Dave McCaskill sought to prove that Cugliari "miscalculated the total gross weight of the stage roof and its attachments" by approximately 7,260 kilograms.&lt;ref name=":142" /&gt; Live Nation issued a statement denying any wrongdoing and vowing to "vigourously defend" itself.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

The hearing was set to begin in June 2015, but was postponed to November as Optex had no lawyer; Optex president Dale Martin eventually represented himself.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; All defendants pleaded not guilty.&lt;ref name=":142" /&gt; After 15 days of hearings, during which Radiohead's managers and crew gave evidence,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; the court ordered another 15 days throughout 2016. Shortly before June, following the defence's request for more time to present its case, the court scheduled further dates in December and January.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In June 2016, the defence persuaded the judge, Shaun Nakatsuru, to drop two of the charges against Live Nation and one charge against Optex for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In June 2017, Nakatsuru declared a mistrial as he had been appointed to the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice|Ontario Superior Court]] and had lost [[jurisdiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2017/06/19/new-trial-ordered-in-deadly-stage-collapse-at-toronto-radiohead-concert.html|title=New trial ordered in deadly stage collapse at Downsview Radiohead concert  {{!}} The Star|work=thestar.com|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a new trial would not have begun until May 2018, the new judge, Ann Nelson, ruled in favour of the defendants' application to have the case dropped under the [[R v Jordan (2016)|Jordan ruling]], which rules that any person charged with an offence has the right to be tried within a "reasonable" timeframe. Nakatsuru had declined a previous application from the defence.&lt;ref name=":142" /&gt; Radiohead released a statement saying: "We are appalled by the decision … This is an insult to the memory of Scott Johnson, his parents and our crew. It offers no consolation, closure or assurance that this kind of accident will not happen again."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/radiohead-on-stalled-stage-collapse-case-we-are-appalled/|title=Radiohead on Stalled Stage Collapse Case: "We Are Appalled"|last=Monroe|first=Jazz|date=8 September 2017|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiohead's management and Johnsons's parents met British members of parliament, who wrote to the [[Canadian High Commissions|Canadian High Commission]] demanding the case be reopened.&lt;ref name=":142" /&gt;

In November 2017, it was announced that the chief coroner of Ontario, Dirk Huyer, will hold an inquest into Johnson's death.&lt;ref name=":142" /&gt; In a statement, Radiohead said: "While this is welcomed it does not bring those responsible for Scott's death to account, and it provides no justice for Scott and his family. We urge the Canadian authorities to look more closely into the treatment of the Downsview stage collapse and indeed all workplace deaths to ensure that accidents such as this can be prevented in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/radiohead-respond-to-inquest-into-stage-collapse-that-killed-a-drum-tech-2166951|title=Radiohead respond to inquest into stage collapse that killed their drum tech - NME|last=Levine|first=Nick|date=30 November 2017|work=[[NME]]|access-date=25 July 2018|language=en-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2018 no date had been set for the inquest.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/20/thom-yorke-addresses-stage-collapse-that-killed-radiohead-drum-technician|title=Thom Yorke addresses stage collapse that killed Radiohead's drum technician|last=Snapes|first=Laura|date=2018-07-20|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 19 July 2018, Radiohead performed at Toronto's [[Scotiabank Arena]], their first performance in Toronto since the collapse. On stage, Yorke condemned the lack of progress in the case and Radiohead held a [[Moment of silence|minute of silence]] before performing their final song, the 1997 single "[[Karma Police]]". ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' journalist Jill Krajewski noted the new meaning in the lyrics "Karma police / arrest this man".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xq8yd/radioheads-thom-yorke-calls-out-toronto-for-lack-of-action-after-stage-collapse|title=Radiohead’s Thom Yorke Calls Out Toronto for Lack of Action After Stage Collapse|last=Jill|first=Krajewski|date=20 July 2018|work=[[Vice (website)|Vice]]|access-date=22 July 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rey de Reyes 2005''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "King of Kings") was the ninth annual [[Rey de Reyes]] [[professional wrestling]] tournament and show, produced by the Mexican [[wrestling promotion]] [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]]. The event took place on March 11, 2005 in the Convention Center in [[Ciudad Madero]], [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]. The main focus of the 2005 Rey de Reyes show was the ninth annual Rey de Reyes tournament, which featured an elimination match with six men competing for the Rey de Reyes title. As in the previous year, [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|TNA]] representatives competed in the finals. The finalists did not have to qualify but were announced in the weeks leading up to the events. The finalists were: [[La Parka II|La Parka]], [[Latin Lover (wrestler)|Latin Lover]], [[Abismo Negro]], [[Chessman (wrestler)|Chessman]], [[Jeff Jarrett]],  [[Konnan]] and [[Cibernético]]. The undercard included a [[Kick Boxing]] match between Humberto Galanez Gabuz and Ty Landez. In the semi-main event [[Octagoncito (AAA)|Octagoncito]] faced [[Pequeño Black Warrior|Mini Psicosis]] in a ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'' where both men put their masks on the line.

==Production==
===Background===
Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican ''[[Lucha Libre]]'', or [[professional wrestling]], [[wrestling promotion|company]] [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] has held a [[Rey de Reyes]] (Spanish for "King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February,&lt;ref name="Rey1997"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#1997 | title = Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Rey de Reyes | accessdate = February 19, 2009 | date=February 21, 1997 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the [[eponym]]ious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's ''Rey''.&lt;ref name=YIR1997&gt;{{cite news|title=1997 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2332|date=January 7, 1998|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004&gt;{{cite news|title=Número Especial - Lo mejor de la lucha libre mexicana durante el 2004|work=SuperLuchas|id=Issue 91|date=January 24, 2005|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Four-man elimination match]] with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules.&lt;ref name="Rey1997"/&gt; There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004/&gt; The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the [[AAA Mega Championship]]. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual ''[[AAA Reina de Reinas Championship|Reina de Reinas]]'' ("Queen of Queens") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept.&lt;ref name=Reinas1999&gt;{{Cite book | author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter= Mexico: AAA Reina de Reinas | page= 400 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas12&gt;{{cite news | author = SuperLuchas staff | title = Lo Mejor de la Lucha Libre Mexicana 2008 | work =SuperLuchas | id = issue 296 | date =  January 6, 2008 | url=http://superluchas.net/?p=11145 | accessdate =  July 11, 2009| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas13&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2009/09/26/aaa-heroes-inmortales-homenaje-a-antonio-pena-resultados-en-vivo-26-septiembre-2009-%C2%BFque-pasara-con-la-lucha-entre-charly-manson-y-chessman-%C2%BFquien-sera-el-luchador-sorpresa/ | title= AAA- Héroes Inmortales III- (Resultados en vivo 26 septiembre 2009) – Cibernético gana el Trofeo Antonio Peña – Electroshock sustituye a Charly Manson contra Chessman – El luchador sorpresa fue Konan Big | author= Marquina, Alva | date= September 26, 2009 | accessdate= September 27, 2009 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine| language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 show was the ninth Rey de Reyes show in the series.

===Storylines===
The Rey de Reyes show featured six [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

The '''Rif Dimashq offensive (August–October 2012)''' ({{lang-ar|اشتباكات ريف دمشق}}) was a Syrian Army offensive in the [[Rif Dimashq Governorate]] during August–October 2012, as part of the [[Syrian Civil War]].

==Background==
After the military defeat of the rebels in the [[Battle of Damascus (2012)|Battle of Damascus]], sporadic clashes continued in some parts of the capital, where the rebellion was using guerilla tactics and hit-and-run attacks against the security forces. In early August 2012, the Syrian Army largely escalated its anti guerilla operations in order to restore the [[status quo ante bellum]] to the governorate.

==Al-Tall==
The city of [[Al-Tall, Syria|Al-Tall]] was known to be an important rebel base around Damascus. When the Battle of Damascus started, the rebels stormed two government buildings and reportedly detained 40 soldiers while seizing a quantity of weapons. The city was also one of the place where the rebel retreated after their defeat in Damascus. At the end of July, rebels were gathering and massing in Al-Tall to ready themselves for another attack on Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian rebels still hopeful as government regains initiative in Damascus |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/syrian-rebels-still-hopeful-as-government-regains-initiative-in-damascus/2012/07/23/gJQA3JLg4W_story.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=23 July 2012|accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of August, the Syrian Army started shelling the rebel positions more intensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Activists: Syria army shells the Damascus Suburbs |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/topic/syria/activists-syria-army-shells-damascus-suburbs |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city became completely besieged by the Army after the abduction of 3 Syrian state-controlled media journalists by the rebels near the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian army shells town after rebels seize TV crew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10386203 |last=Karam |first=Zeina |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=11 August 2012 |accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Syrian Army took control of the city and cleared it of rebel presence 17 August, while the Syrian National Council described the area a "sinister zone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clashes erupt near Damascus military airport: watchdog |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/topic/syria/clashes-erupt-near-damascus-military-airport-watchdog |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=17 August 2012 |accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three abducted journalists were freed by the Syrian Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria TV says govt troops free captive journalists |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501713_162-57494290/syria-tv-says-govt-troops-free-captive-journalists/ |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=16 August 2012 |accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies of 58 executed civilians were reportedly found in the town following the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/syriahroe/posts/270656626376016|title=Final death toll for 18/8/2012|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supportkurds.org/news/sunday-19-august-2012/|title=Sunday 19 August 2012|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Southern Damascus outskirts==
On '''17 August''', fighting broke out between the Syrian Army and rebel fighters near the Damascus Military Airport, near [[Mezzeh]] district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/topic/syria/clashes-erupt-near-damascus-military-airport-watchdog|title=Clashes erupt near Damascus military airport: watchdog|work=Al Jazeera Blogs|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On '''20 August''', activists in Damascus again reported battles between the Army and rebel fighters in the Mezzeh district of Damascus. Helicopters were bombarding the district, leading to at least 12 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/topic/syria/activists-clashes-near-airport-mazzeh|title=Activists: Clashes near airport in Mazzeh|work=Al Jazeera Blogs|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On '''22 August''', residents and activists reported heavy shelling in the southern Damascus districts of [[Kafr Sousa|Kfar Souseh]], [[Darayya]], [[Qadam]] and [[Nahr Aisha]]. At least 40 people were killed in the shelling, which was accompanied by attacks from helicopters, and in ensuing ground raids in southern Damascus. The target of the military raids were reportedly rebel [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] teams, which had been targeting the military airport at Mezzeh the previous days. According to one activist, at least 36 of those killed were rebel fighters. Maaz al-Shami, a member of the Damascus Media Office, a group of young opposition activists monitoring the clashes in Damascus, claimed that the rebels who retreated from the capital, after the battle the previous month, had started to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/08/20128229218818879.html|title=Syria resumes shelling on Damascus districts|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Syrian-forces-kill-at-least-31-in-Damascus-raids-3798926.php Syrian forces kill at least 31 in Damascus raids] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On '''23 August''', and in parallel of the [[Darayya]] operation, the Syrian Army launched an important operation in Damascus, in what an opponent described as an "attempt to crush the rebellion once for all" in the capital. Several districts were cut off by the army and several executions of rebels fighters in the city were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Damascus, "death is everywhere" |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/topic/syria/damascus-death-everywhere |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=23 August 2012 |accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of executed bodies were later found on 24 August.&lt;ref name=Chulov&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian regime hits back in Damascus as ill-equipped rebels struggle |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/syria-regime-hits-back-damascus |last=Chulov |first=Martin |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=24 August 2012 |accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The army also arrested several people in the Kfar Sousseh district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Military hits town near Damascus, 60 killed in Syria |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/8/23/worldupdates/2012-08-23T112847Z_249_BRE86H18C_RTROPTT_0_UK-SYRIA-CRISIS&amp;sec=Worldupdates |last=Oweis |first=Khaled Y |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=23 August 2012 |accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; State media reported that the Syrian Army discovered and killed the members of a rebel group in the Nair Aisha neighbourhood of the capital.

On '''7 September''', clashes broke out between rebels and the Syrian Army in Kazaz on the southern outskirts of Damascus, after a rebel attack on Army roadblocks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.aljazeera.com/topic/syria/clashes-reported-southern-neighbourhood-damascus "Clashes reported in southern neighbourhood of Damascus,"] Al Jazzera (7 September 2012).

Retrieved 5 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On '''12 September''', the military started shelling the town of [[Al-Hajar al-Aswad]], on the southern outskirts of Damascus. The town was regarded to be one of the last rebel strongholds on the southern fringes of the capital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/bre88a0wp-us-syria-crisis-damascus/ Assad's forces shell Damascus rebel stronghold, 4 killed]&lt;/ref&gt; The shelling continued until 19 September, when government troops advanced into al-Hajar al-Aswad, as well as the rebel-held al-Qadam and al-A'sali neighborhoods of Damascus, after the rebels retreated from the area during the morning. Army attacks on the south-western suburbs of Muadhamiya, [[Judaydat Artuz]] and [[Kanakir]] and [[Qudsaya]] to the north-west were also reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-09/19/c_131861173.htm|title=Street fighting ongoing in Syria, rebels retreat from restive district of capital|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19645269|title=Syria conflict: Damascus suburb sees heavy fighting|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fighting, the government reported that tens of rebels were killed in the counter-insurgency operation in al-Hajar al-Haswad. Three rebel technicals were also reportedly destroyed in the operation on 15 September.&lt;ref name="208.43.232.81"&gt;http://208.43.232.81/eng/21/2012/09/15/441772.htm{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On '''15 September''', state media reported that a qualitative operation took place in [[Al-Sbeineh]] city. The Syrian Army later found the corpses of 17 rebels who had been killed in the clashes and then burned by their comrades to avoid them being recognized.&lt;ref name="208.43.232.81"/&gt;

On '''23 September''', the military started shelling the rebel-held town of Al Thiabieh, 11 miles from Damascus. When the rebels from Al Thiabieh and the surrounding area launched a counter-attack the shelling became more fierce. After three days of bombardment, during which two rebel fighters were killed, FSA forces retreated from the town and the military entered on 26 September. According to opposition activists and rebels, the military than started raiding homes, killing 50 people. By the end of the day, the Army withdrew from Al Thiabieh, after completing their operation. An estimated 40 to 107 people were killed during the attack on the town in what was described as a massacre by the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/26/world/meast/syria-massacre/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|title=Witness: Scores killed in 'massacre' south of Damascus|date=26 September 2012|work=CNN|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=286293|title=Rights group: 300 people killed in one day in Syria|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The increase in the number of operations in [[Rif Dimashq Governorate|Rif Dimashq]] and Damascus by the Syrian Army and in their intensity is clear. The result is that the ability of rebels fighters to counter the army offensives in their former strongholds in the region seem to have tapered off.&lt;ref name=Chulov/&gt; This seem to be a result of the new and more violent tactic being adopted by the Syrian Army against rebel former strongholds. One resident of [[Midan]] told that everybody was being arrested or killed and that the army was making no difference between residents and identified gunmen contrary to the previous campaigns.&lt;ref name=Chulov/&gt;

[[Wissam Tarif]] from the opposition group [[Avaaz]] said that the Army strategy was to provoke intensively the Free Syrian Army into clashes in order to overstretch them, reporting that the operations of the Syrian Army have been intensive, going night and day for ten days. The Syrian Army has also completely locked down the border with Lebanon to prevent reinforcements and weapons to come from the south of Damascus.&lt;ref name=Chulov/&gt;

The number of reported execution has been described as unprecedented by the opposition activists and several of them see it as a punishment and an intimidation on the population who shelter the rebels near the capital. The activist claimed that the majority of the people killed, overwhelmingly men, are civilians. The death toll from the beginning of August until 24 August has been put at 730 by the same activists.&lt;ref name=Sly&gt;{{cite news|title=Gruesome killings mark escalation of violence in Syrian capital |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/gruesome-killings-mark-escalation-of-violence-in-syrian-capital/2012/08/23/597e09c4-ed57-11e1-b09d-07d971dee30a_story.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |last=Sly |first=Liz |date=24 August 2012 |accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The counter-insurgency operations of the Syrian Army have been more lethal than the [[Battle of Aleppo (2012)|Battle of Aleppo]], happening at the same moment in the north of Syria.&lt;ref name=Sly/&gt;

'''Rossini in Wildbad''' is a [[bel canto]] [[opera festival]] in [[Bad Wildbad]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], specialising in the lesser-known operas of [[Gioachino Rossini]] and his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rossini-in-wildbad.com/ Rossini in Wildbad Festival] website. Retrieved 25 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival commemorates a stay by Rossini at the town's spa in 1856, which apparently invigorated him enough to start composing again.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/arts/25iht-loomis25.html "Rossini and Contemporaries, Snuggly at Home in the Black Forest"], George Loomis, ''[[New York Times]]'', 24 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival was founded in 1989 by the conductor {{ill|Wilhelm Keitel (conductor)|de|Wilhelm Keitel (Dirigent)|lt=Wilhelm Keitel}}.

'''The inauguration of the [[President of Russia]]''' (Инаугурация президента России) is a ceremony to mark the start of the term of the President of Russia. The inauguration is carried out six years (formerly four years) after the inauguration of the previous president. In the case of extraordinary election, the inauguration is conducted thirty days after the announcement of the official election results by the Central Election Commission. Traditionally, inauguration takes place in the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]]. The inauguration ceremony of the Russian president has traditionally been accompanied by the festive prayer service of the [[Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus']], which dates back to 1498, when the first wedding took place for the reign of Prince [[Dmitry Ivanovich (grandson of Ivan III)|Dmitry Ivanovich]], the grandson of [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tass.ru/obschestvo/5180109|title=В день инаугурации президента России патриарх Кирилл совершит молебен|work=ТАСС|access-date=2018-05-08|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
The following people are usually present at the inauguration:
*Members of the [[Federation Council of Russia]]
*[[State Duma]] deputies
*The judges of the [[Constitutional Court of Russia|Constitutional Court]]
*Heads of diplomatic missions
*Representatives of the [[Government of the Russian Federation]] and federal authorities
*Diplomatic corps

The ceremony in the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] begins (since 2008) when the presidential [[military band]] from the [[Kremlin Regiment]] plays the ''[[Festival Coronation March]]'' by [[Tchaikovsky]].

==The Ceremony==
The inauguration proper starts with the outgoing President reviewing the [[Kremlin Regiment]] for one last time as President and Supreme Commander of the uniformed forces of the Federation in [[Cathedral Square, Moscow|Cathedral Square]] and he then walks towards the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]].

The President-elect's procession arrives at the Grand Kremlin Palace through the Spassky Gate. The President-elect passes through St. George's Hall and St. Andrews's Hall into Alexander Hall, which holds the flags of the Russian Standard of the President and the Emblem of the Russian president. The Chairman of the Constitutional Court and the Chairmen of both chambers of parliament sit at a raised platform where the President-elect joins them. The Chairman of the Constitutional Court places both Constitution and the President's Chain of Office on the rostrum. After the outgoing President makes his address, the Chairman of the Constitutional Court of Russia then asks President-elect to take the oath of office.

The president-elect places his right hand on the Constitution of the [[Russian Federation]] and recites the presidential oath. The Chairman of the Constitutional Court then gives the President the chain of office and proclaims the inauguration of a new President. After the new president is inaugurated the [[National anthem of Russia|Russian national anthem]] is played and the standard of the head of state is raised at the dome of the presidential residence. This is followed by the new President's speech and as the speech ends and the new President leaves the halls "Slavsya" by [[Mikhail Glinka]] from his first opera [[A Life for the Tsar]] is played by the military band as a [[21-gun salute]] is fired.

As the inauguration has been held every 4 and now 6 years on 7 May, the anniversary of the raising of the Kremlin Regiment, the ceremony ends in Cathedral Square with both the outgoing and incoming presidents attending the latter's 1st inspection of the regiment as the Supreme Commander of the armed and civil security forces of Russia, greeting it on its anniversary. It is then followed by the marchpart of the entire regiment assembled.

'''Sharon Rina Lopatka''' (September 20, 1961 – October 1996) was an Internet entrepreneur in [[Hampstead, Maryland]], United States, who was killed in a case of apparent [[consensual homicide]]. Lopatka was [[torture]]d and [[Strangulation|strangled to death]] on October 16, 1996, by Robert "Bobby" Frederick Glass, a computer analyst from [[North Carolina]]. The apparent purpose was mutual [[Paraphilia|sexual gratification]].  The case was reportedly the first where a police department arrested a murder suspect with evidence primarily gathered from email messages.&lt;ref name=bell5/&gt;

==Background==
Sharon Lopatka was the first of four daughters born to [[Orthodox Jewish]] parents Mr. and Mrs. Abraham J. Denburg.&lt;ref name=bell2&gt;Bell, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; They were members of the [[Beth Tfiloh Congregation]], Abraham being a [[cantor]] at the synagogue.&lt;ref name=bell2/&gt; Raised in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, Sharon was seen by her classmates "as normal as you can get", wrote ''[[The News &amp; Observer]]'', and was a part of sport teams and her school's choir club.&lt;ref name=bell2/&gt; Graduating from [[Pikesville High School]] in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aintnowaytogo.com/bdSuicid.htm "Take My Life"]. ''[[The News &amp; Observer]]''. Retrieved October 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Lopatka married construction worker Victor in [[Ellicott City, Maryland]], in 1991, and moved with him to a ranch-esque [[tract house]] in [[Hampstead, Maryland]], in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=bell2/&gt; The marriage was described by a classmate of Lopatka as a "way of breaking away", and her parents did not support it.&lt;ref name=bell2/&gt; 

In 1995 Lopatka started doing [[online advertising]] businesses from her Ellicott City home in order to make additional money.&lt;ref name=bell2/&gt;&lt;ref name=lybarger&gt;Lybarger, Jeremy (July 3, 2016). [http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/headline-story/16932/usenet-sharon-lopatka-consensual-murder/ "A death on Usenet: Sharon Lopatka and the strange case of "consensual murder""]. ''[[The Kernel]]''. Retrieved August 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The first website she hosted, "House of Dion", was for selling home decor guides by mail for seven dollars.&lt;ref name=lybarger/&gt; An advertisement on the website read, "Home decorating secrets seen in the posh homes from the New England states to the Hollywood homes can now be yours. Never published before! Quick easy ways to decorate your home."&lt;ref name=lybarger/&gt; 

She was paid $50 per advertisement rewriting [[ad copy]] her business titled "Classified Concepts".&lt;ref name=bell2/&gt; She ran several websites for distributing [[psychic reading]]s, also garnering a percentage of the money from sales of other services with [[premium-rate telephone number]]s advertised on her websites.&lt;ref name=bell2/&gt; 

In addition to her advertising and psychic reading business, Lopatka marketed pornographic content, under the alias Nancy Carlson, which depicted women who were unconscious from being drugged, hypnotized or chloroformed engaging in sex acts with each other. She sold her [[undergarment]]s, an advertisement for them reading, "Is there anyone out there interested in buying my worn panties..."&lt;ref name=bell2/&gt; She also used the Internet to fulfill her own sexual desires that were often considered irregular to society.&lt;ref name=bell2/&gt; Lopatka went under more pseudonyms and [[persona]]s when on pornographic [[chat rooms]] of sites like fetishfeet.com and sexbondage.com that had members with [[Sexual fetishism|fetishes]] such as [[necrophilia]], [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] and [[sadomasochism]].&lt;ref name=bell3&gt;Bell, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 50 messages that showed her sexual desire of being tortured to death were discovered by ''The News &amp; Observer''.&lt;ref name=bell3/&gt; Lopatka's character of Carlson, who was a [[disciplinarian]] [[dominatrix]] pornographic film actress who weighed 300 pounds, was one of the pseudonyms she used in the chats.&lt;ref name=bell3/&gt; This alarmed a [[sex workers' rights]] activist named Tanith who tried to stop Lopatka's behavior.&lt;ref name=bell3/&gt; Lopatka replied to Tanith that "I want the real thing. I did not ask for you preaching to me."&lt;ref name=bell3/&gt;

Robert "Bobby" Frederick Glass worked as a computer analyst for the government of [[Catawba County, North Carolina]], for nearly 16 years. His tasks included programming tax rolls and keeping track of the amount of vehicle gas consumption in the county.&lt;ref name=bell4&gt;Bell, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; For 14 years until May 1996, Glass was married to his wife Sherri, and the couple had two daughters and one son.&lt;ref name=bell4/&gt; Later in the marriage, Sherri noticed her husband was spending much more time on the computer than with her. Wary, she logged on to his email account and found several "raw, violent and disturbing" messages that he sent under the pseudonyms Toyman and Slowhand.&lt;ref name=bell4/&gt; As a result, the two separated.&lt;ref name=bell4/&gt; Lopatka first met Glass in August 1996 while in a pornographic chat room.&lt;ref name=bell5&gt; Bell, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Through email, Lopatka presented her fetish of being tortured to Glass, while he sent messages about how he would fulfill her fantasy.&lt;ref name=bell5/&gt; Close to 900 pages of emails between the two were discovered by police during the investigation of Lopatka's death.&lt;ref name=bell5/&gt;

==Death and investigation==
On the morning of October 13, 1996, Lopatka informed her husband she was going to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to meet acquaintances.&lt;ref name=bell5/&gt; She also left him a note that she would not be returning home and requested not to track down Glass. The note also read that "If my body is never retrieved, don't worry: know that I'm at peace."&lt;ref name=bell5/&gt; That morning, Lopatka drove her blue [[Honda Civic]] to [[Baltimore]]'s [[Pennsylvania Station (Baltimore)|Pennsylvania Station]] (a 45-minute drive)&lt;ref name=lybarger/&gt; and had arrived on an [[Amtrak]] train at [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], by 8:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name=lybarger/&gt;&lt;ref name=bell5/&gt; Glass drove with Lopatka in his pickup truck to his rural [[Lenoir, North Carolina]] mobile home, 80 miles from Charlotte.&lt;ref name=bell5/&gt; 

Lopatka's husband Victor found the note his wife left for him and notified the police, who found six weeks of email conversations between Lopatka and Glass.&lt;ref name="lybarger" /&gt; In her email correspondence with Glass, Lopatka had explicitly asked Glass to torture her to death.&lt;ref name="lybarger" /&gt;

Glass, interviewed later during his imprisonment, admitted to fulfilling Lopatka's torture fantasy, but also said that the death was an accident. As he recalled, "I don't know how much I pulled the rope&amp;nbsp;... I never wanted to kill her, but she ended up dead."&lt;ref name="bell5" /&gt; This was supported by the autopsy performed by Dr. John Butts, the chief state medical examiner of North Carolina, who stated that Lopatka was accidentally strangled to death three days after her arrival in North Carolina.&lt;ref name="bell5" /&gt; However, the police disagreed: their search warrant affidavits described the death as intentional, and that the emails proved it.&lt;ref name="bell5" /&gt; 

North Carolina police staked out Glass' home for several days,&lt;ref name="lybarger" /&gt; but did not see Lopatka. On October 25, 1996, Judge Beverly T. Beal issued a search warrant on the home, and inside the house, investigators discovered items belonging to Lopatka.&lt;ref name="bell5" /&gt; In addition, they also found drug and [[List of BDSM equipment|bondage equipment]], child pornography magazines, a [[.357 Magnum]] pistol, and several computer disks, as well as trash and toys outside the trailer.&lt;ref name="lybarger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bell5" /&gt; A police officer then noticed a mound of soil 75 feet away from the home, before finding some bodyparts buried two-and-a-half feet below.&lt;ref name="bell5" /&gt; Glass was arrested at work following this discovery, charged with [[first-degree murder]], and held without bond in the [[Caldwell County Jail]].&lt;ref name="bell5" /&gt; Glass was also hit with additional state and federal charges for the possession of child pornography.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-02-20/news/0202200038_1_glass-caldwell-county-lopatka|title=Killer of Carroll woman dies in N.C. prison|work=tribunedigital-baltimoresun|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; County investigator D. A. Brown said that Lopatka's body might have never been found had it been buried in the woods behind Glass' house.&lt;ref name="bell5" /&gt; 

Glass pleaded guilty to [[voluntary manslaughter]] and sexual exploitation charges on January 27, 2000, and was sentenced to 36–53 months in the Avery-Mitchell Correctional Institution. He was also sentenced to an additional 27 months for federal charges of second-degree minor exploitation, to be served consecutively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Glass was found dead of a [[heart attack]] in prison on February 20, 2002, one month before he was to finish his state sentence and begin his federal sentence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Influence==
The Lopatka case was reportedly the first where a murder suspect was put in custody by the police department mainly due to evidence from emails.&lt;ref name=bell5/&gt; A majority of the media coverage of Lopatka's killing mainly put their focus on the dangerous consequences of Internet-held meetings.&lt;ref name=bell5/&gt; Several people requested that a form of censorship should be created to better protect humans from killings like that of Lopatka's, while anti-censorship activists counter-argued that people could better express controversial beliefs in an open forum without the need of a real identity.&lt;ref name=bell5/&gt; Writers have labeled the situation as one of the earliest examples of what psychologists called Mardi Gras phenomenon, where one uses a variety of personalities to decrease their chances of having a consequence for their actions.&lt;ref name=bell5/&gt; Thanks to the popularity of the case, more psychologists increased their desire to have a better understanding of atypical sexual desires caused by [[Sadomasochism|sadism]], [[BDSM|masochism]] and [[asphyxia]].&lt;ref name="bell6"&gt;Bell, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
The case inspired a 2008 film, ''[[Downloading Nancy]]'', which premiered at Sundance Film Festival and had a wider release in 2009. Interviews with screenwriter Lee Ross indicate he was aware of the Lopatka case and found it "dark, horrible ... and intriguing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aivf.org/magazine/06/2009/dlnancyinterview |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104235003/http://www.aivf.org/magazine/06/2009/dlnancyinterview |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 4, 2010 |title=Q&amp;A with the writers of Downloading Nancy &amp;#124; The Independent |publisher=Aivf.org |date=June 9, 2009 |accessdate=August 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:spammed-mail-folder.png|thumb|An email box folder littered with spam messages]]
'''Spamming''' is the use of messaging systems to send an unsolicited message ('''spam'''), especially advertising, as well as sending messages repeatedly on the same site. While the most widely recognized form of spam is [[email spam]], the term is applied to similar abuses in other media: [[messaging spam|instant messaging spam]], [[Newsgroup spam|Usenet newsgroup spam]], [[spamdexing|Web search engine spam]], [[spam in blogs]], [[wiki spam]], [[classified advertising|online classified ads]] spam, [[mobile phone spam|mobile phone messaging spam]], [[Forum spam|Internet forum spam]], [[junk fax| junk fax transmissions]], [[social spam]], spam mobile apps,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/about/spam.html#spam|title=Developer Policy Center – Intellectual Property, Deception, and Spam|website=play.google.com|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; television [[advertising]] and file sharing spam. It is named after [[Spam (food)|Spam]], a luncheon meat, by way of a [[Spam (Monty Python)|Monty Python sketch]] about a restaurant that has Spam in every dish and where patrons annoyingly chant "Spam!" over and over again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spam |title=Spam | type = definition &amp; more | work = Merriam-Webster Dictionary | date=2012-08-31 | accessdate =2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Monty Python|title=Spam - Monty Python's The Flying Circus|date=2009-01-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_eYSuPKP3Y|accessdate=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spamming remains economically viable because advertisers have no operating costs beyond the management of their mailing lists, servers, infrastructures, IP ranges, and domain names, and it is difficult to hold senders accountable for their mass mailings. The costs, such as lost productivity and fraud, are borne by the public and by [[Internet service provider]]s, which have been forced to add extra capacity to cope with the volume. Spamming has been the subject of legislation in many jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.spamhaus.org/definition.html | work =The Spamhaus Project | title = The Definition of Spam | accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who creates spam is called a ''spammer''.&lt;ref name = Gyongyi&gt;{{Cite book | first = Zoltan | last = Gyöngyi | authorlink1 = Zoltan Gyöngyi | first2 = Hector | last2 = Garcia-Molina | authorlink2 = Héctor García-Molina | contribution = Web spam taxonomy | contribution-url = http://airweb.cse.lehigh.edu/2005/gyongyi.pdf | title = Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Adversarial Information Retrieval on the Web (AIRWeb), 2005 in The 14th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2005) May 10, (Tue) – 14 (Sat), 2005, Nippon Convention Center (Makuhari Messe), Chiba, Japan | year = 2005 | publisher = ACM Press | place = New York, NY | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | isbn = 1-59593-046-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''spam'' is derived from the 1970 [[Spam (Monty Python)|''Spam'']] [[sketch comedy|sketch]] of the [[BBC]] television comedy series ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''.&lt;ref name="tools.ietf.org"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2635 | title = RFC 2635 - DON\x27T SPEW A Set of Guidelines for Mass Unsolicited Mailings and Postings (spam*): | accessdate = 2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The sketch, set in a [[Cafe (British)|cafe]], has a waitress reading out a menu where nearly every item includes [[Spam (food)|Spam]] canned luncheon meat. As the waitress recites the Spam-filled menu, a chorus of [[Viking]] patrons drowns out all conversations with a song, repeating "Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam… Spammity Spam! Wonderful Spam!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thegoodword.co.uk/2010/09/20/the-origin-of-the-word-spam/| title = The Origin of the word 'Spam': | accessdate = 2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excessive amount of Spam mentioned references the preponderance of it and other imported canned meat products in the United Kingdom after World War II, as the country struggled to rebuild its agricultural base.

In the 1980s the term was adopted to describe certain abusive users who frequented [[Bulletin board system|BBSs]] and [[MUD]]s, who would repeat "Spam" a huge number of times to scroll other users' text off the screen.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.templetons.com/brad/spamterm.html |title=Origin of the term "spam" to mean net abuse |publisher=Templetons.com |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early chat rooms services like PeopleLink and the early days of Online America (later known as America Online or AOL), they actually flooded the screen with quotes from the Monty Python Spam sketch.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} This was used as a tactic by insiders of a group that wanted to drive newcomers out of the room so the usual conversation could continue. It was also used to prevent members of rival groups from chatting—for instance, ''Star Wars'' fans often invaded ''[[Star Trek]]'' chat rooms, filling the space with blocks of text until the ''Star Trek'' fans left.&lt;ref name="goldberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myshelegoldberg.com/the-origins-of-spam/ |title=The Origins of Spam |author= Goldberg, Myshele |accessdate=2014-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It later came to be used on [[Usenet]] to mean ''excessive multiple posting''—the repeated posting of the same message. The unwanted message would appear in many, if not all newsgroups, just as Spam appeared in nearly all the menu items in the Monty Python sketch. The first usage of this sense was by [[Joel Furr]]&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7322615.stm |title=Spam blights e-mail 15 years on |author=Darren Waters |date=31 March 2008 |work= |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use had also become established—to spam Usenet was flooding newsgroups with junk messages. The word was also attributed to the flood of "[[Make Money Fast]]" messages that clogged many newsgroups during the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} In 1998, the [[New Oxford Dictionary of English]], which had previously only defined "spam" in relation to the trademarked food product, added a second definition to its entry for "spam": "Irrelevant or inappropriate messages sent on the Internet to a large number of newsgroups or users."

There was also an effort to differentiate between types of newsgroup spam. Messages that were [[Crossposting|crossposted]] to too many newsgroups at once – as opposed to those that were posted too frequently – were called [[velveeta]] (after a cheese product). But this term didn't persist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/V/velveeta.html | contribution = velveeta | title = The [[Jargon File]] | edition = 4.4.7 | publisher = CatB}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Pre-Internet===
In the late 19th Century [[Western Union]] allowed telegraphic messages on its network to be sent to multiple destinations. The first recorded instance of a mass unsolicited commercial telegram is from May 1864, when some British politicians received an unsolicited telegram advertising a dentist.&lt;ref name="TheEconomist"&gt;{{cite news | title = Getting the message, at last | date = 2007-12-14 | url = http://www.economist.com/opinion/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=10286400 | work = The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The earliest documented spam (although the term had not yet been coined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/01/weekinreview/01ZELL.html | work=The New York Times | first=Tom | last = Zeller | title= Ideas &amp; Trends; Spamology | date=1 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a message advertising the availability of a new model of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] computers sent by Gary Thuerk to 393 recipients on [[ARPANET]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90160617 | title = At 30, Spam Going Nowhere Soon | type = interviews | first1 = Gary | last1 = Thuerk | first2 = Joel | last2 = Furr | publisher = NPR}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than send a separate message to each person, which was the standard practice at the time, he had an assistant, Carl Gartley, write a single mass email. Reaction from the net community was fiercely negative, but the spam did generate some sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.templetons.com/brad/spamreact.html |title=Reaction to the DEC Spam of 1978 |publisher= Templetons | accessdate = 2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = sfc&gt;{{cite news| title = A very unhappy birthday to spam, age 30 | first = Tom | last = Abate| work = San Francisco Chronicle | date = May 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spamming had been practiced as a prank by participants in [[multi-user dungeon]] games, to fill their rivals' accounts with unwanted electronic junk.&lt;ref name= sfc/&gt;

The first major commercial spam incident started on March 5, 1994, when a husband and wife team of lawyers, [[Laurence Canter and Martha Siegel]], began using bulk [[Usenet]] posting to advertise [[immigration]] law services. The incident was commonly termed the "[[United States Permanent Resident Card|Green Card]] spam", after the subject line of the postings. Defiant in the face of widespread condemnation, the attorneys claimed their detractors were hypocrites or "zealouts", claimed they had a [[free speech]] right to send unwanted commercial messages, and labeled their opponents "anti-commerce radicals". The couple wrote a controversial book entitled ''How to Make a Fortune on the Information Superhighway''.&lt;ref name=sfc /&gt;

An early example of [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[fundraising]] bulk posting via [[Usenet]] also occurred in 1994 on behalf of CitiHope, an [[NGO]] attempting to raise funds to rescue children at risk during the [[Bosnian War]]. However, as it was a violation of their terms of service, the ISP [[Panix (ISP)|Panix]] deleted all of the bulk posts from Usenet, only missing [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!search/citihope$20orphan$20bosnia three copies]{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}.

Within a few years, the focus of spamming (and anti-spam efforts) moved chiefly to email, where it remains today.&lt;ref name = "autogenerated2" /&gt; By 1999, Khan C. Smith, a well known hacker at the time, had begun to commercialize the bulk email industry and rallied thousands into the business by building more friendly bulk email software and providing internet access illegally hacked from major ISPs such as Earthlink and Botnets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conway|first1=Andrew|title=Twenty Years of Spam|url=https://blog.cloudmark.com/2014/04/11/twenty-years-of-spam/|website=Cloudmark|accessdate=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2009, the majority of spam sent around the World was in the [[English language]]; spammers began using automatic translation services to send spam in other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Danchev, Dancho. "[http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=3813&amp;tag=rbxccnbzd1 Spammers go multilingual, use automatic translation services]." ''[[ZDNet]]''. July 28, 2009. Retrieved on August 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In different media==

===Email===
{{Main |Email spam}}
Email spam, also known as unsolicited bulk email (UBE), or junk mail, is the practice of sending unwanted email messages, frequently with commercial content, in large quantities. Spam in email started to become a problem when the Internet was opened for commercial use in the mid-1990s. It grew exponentially over the following years, and by 2007 it composed some 80 to 85 percent of all e-mail, by a conservative estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.maawg.org/about/MAAWG20072Q_Metrics_Report.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071203010401/http://www.maawg.org/about/MAAWG20072Q_Metrics_Report.pdf |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2007-12-03 |title= Email Metrics Report |publisher= MAAWG |format= PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure to make email spam illegal has resulted in legislation in some jurisdictions, but less so in others. The efforts taken by governing bodies, security systems and email service providers seem to be helping to reduce the volume of email spam. According to "2014 Internet Security Threat Report, Volume 19" published by [[Symantec|Symantec Corporation]], spam volume dropped to 66% of all email traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-istr_main_report_v19_21291018.en-us.pdf |title=2014 Internet Security Threat Report, Volume 19 | format = PDF |publisher = Symantec Corporation | accessdate = 7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An industry of [[email address harvesting]] is dedicated to collecting email addresses and selling compiled databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.listdna.com/ |title=FileOn List Builder-Extract URL, MetaTags, Email, Phone, Fax from www-Optimized Webcrawler |publisher = List DNA |accessdate= 2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these address-harvesting approaches rely on users not reading the fine print of agreements, resulting in their agreeing to send messages indiscriminately to their contacts. This is a common approach in [[social networking spam]] such as that generated by the social networking site [[Quechup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Saul | last = Hansell | url = http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/13/your-former-boyfriends-mother-wants-to-be-your-friend/ | title = Social network launches worldwide spam campaign | newspaper = The New York Times | date = September 13, 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instant messaging===
{{Main|Messaging spam}}

Instant messaging spam makes use of [[instant messaging]] systems. Although less prevalent than its e-mail counterpart, according to a report from Ferris Research, 500 million spam IMs were sent in 2003, twice the level of 2002.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Newsgroup and forum===
{{Main|Newsgroup spam}}

Newsgroup spam is a type of spam where the targets are Usenet newsgroups. Spamming of Usenet newsgroups actually pre-dates e-mail spam. Usenet convention defines spamming as excessive multiple posting, that is, the repeated posting of a message (or substantially similar messages). The prevalence of Usenet spam led to the development of the [[Breidbart Index]] as an objective measure of a message's "spamminess".

{{Main|Forum spam}}

Forum spam is the creation of advertising messages on Internet forums. It is generally done by automated spambots. Most forum spam consists of links to external sites, with the dual goals of increasing search engine visibility in highly competitive areas such as weight loss, pharmaceuticals, gambling, pornography, real estate or loans, and generating more traffic for these commercial websites. Some of these links contain code to track the spambot's identity; if a sale goes through, the spammer behind the spambot earns a commission.

===Mobile phone===
{{Main|Mobile phone spam}}

Mobile phone spam is directed at the [[text messaging]] service of a [[mobile phone]]. This can be especially irritating to customers not only for the inconvenience, but also because of the fee they may be charged per text message received in some markets.
To comply with CAN-SPAM regulations in the US, SMS messages now must provide options of HELP and STOP, the latter to end communication with the advertiser via SMS altogether.

Despite the high number of phone users, there has not been so much phone spam, because there is a charge for sending SMS. Recently, there are also observations of mobile phone spam delivered via browser push notifications. These can be a result of allowing websites which are malicious or delivering malicious ads to send a user notifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lotsofways.de/en/is-this-website-allowed-to-send-you-notificationsno-caution-is-advised/ |title=Is this website allowed to send you notifications? NO! - caution is advised. |publisher=lotsofways.de |date=2018-10-18 |accessdate=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social networking spam===
{{Main|Social networking spam}}
Facebook and Twitter are not immune to messages containing spam links. Most insidiously, spammers hack into accounts and send false links under the guise of a user's trusted contacts such as friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmnews.com/marketers-need-to-build-trust-as-spam-hits-social-networks/article/242633/ "Marketers need to build trust as spam hits social networks"], Grace Bello, Direct Marketing News, June 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As for Twitter, spammers gain credibility by following verified accounts such as that of Lady Gaga; when that account owner follows the spammer back, it legitimizes the spammer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://twitter.mpi-sws.org/spam/pubs/twitterSpam_WWW2012.pdf Understanding and Combating Link Farming in the Twitter Social Network], Max Planck Centre for Computer Science&lt;/ref&gt;
Twitter has studied what interest structures allow their users to receive interesting tweets and avoid spam, despite the site using the broadcast model, in which all tweets from a user are broadcast to all followers of the user.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stanford.edu/~rezab/papers/precision.pdf On the Precision of Social and Information Networks]&lt;/ref&gt; Spammers, out of malicious intent, post either unwanted (or irrelevant) information or spread misinformation on social media platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Arushi|last2=Kaushal|first2=Rishabh|title=Improving spam detection in Online Social Networks|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7100738/|website=www.ieee.org|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social spam===
Spreading beyond the centrally managed social networking platforms, user-generated content increasingly appears on business, government, and nonprofit websites worldwide. Fake accounts and comments planted by computers programmed to issue social spam can infiltrate these websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itworld.com/it-managementstrategy/264648/social-spam-taking-over-internet|title=Social spam is taking over the Internet|author=Dan Tynan|date=3 April 2012|work=ITworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online game messaging===
Many online games allow players to contact each other via player-to-player messaging, chat rooms, or public discussion areas. What qualifies as spam varies from game to game, but usually this term applies to all forms of message flooding, violating the terms of service contract for the website. This is particularly common in MMORPGs where the spammers are trying to sell game-related "items" for real-world money, chiefly among them being in-game currency. In gameplay terms, spamming also refers to the repetitive use of the same combat skills as a cheap tactic (e.g. "to defeat the blue dragon, just spam fireballs").

===Blog, wiki, and guestbook===
{{Main|Spam in blogs}}
[[Blog spam]] is spamming on [[Blog|weblogs]]. In 2003, this type of spam took advantage of the open nature of comments in the blogging software [[Movable Type]] by repeatedly placing comments to various blog posts that provided nothing more than a link to the spammer's commercial web site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.03/google.html?pg=7 The (Evil) Genius of Comment Spammers] - ''Wired Magazine'', March 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar [[attack (computing)|attacks]] are often performed against [[wiki]]s and [[guestbook]]s, both of which accept user contributions.
Another possible form of spam in blogs is the spamming of a certain tag on websites such as Tumblr.

===Spam targeting video sharing sites===
[[File:Youtube Free Movie spam.png|thumb|200px|right|Screenshot from a spam video on YouTube claiming that the film in question has been deleted from the site, and can only be accessed on the link posted by the spambot in the video description (if the video were actually removed by YouTube, the description would be inaccessible, and the deletion notification would look different).]]
[[Video hosting service|Video sharing]] sites, such as [[YouTube]], are now frequently targeted by spammers. The most common technique involves spammers (or [[spambots]]) posting links to sites, on the comments section of random videos or user profiles. With the addition of a "thumbs up/thumbs down" feature, groups of spambots may constantly "thumbs up" a comment, getting it into the top comments section and making the message more visible.

Yet another kind is actual video spam, giving the uploaded movie a name and description with a popular figure or event that is likely to draw attention, or within the video has a certain image timed to come up as the video's [[thumbnail]] image to mislead the viewer, such as a still image from a feature film, purporting to be a part-by-part piece of a movie being pirated, e.g. ''Big Buck Bunny Full Movie Online - Part 1/10 HD'', a link to a supposed [[keygen]], trainer, ISO file for a [[video game]], or something similar. The actual content of the video ends up being totally unrelated, a [[Rickroll]], offensive, or simply on-screen text of a link to the site being promoted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcc.ufmg.br/~fabricio/download/sigirfp437-benevenuto.pdf Fabrício Benevenuto, Tiago Rodrigues, Virgílio Almeida, Jussara Almeida and Marcos Gonçalves. Detecting Spammers and Content Promoters in Online Video Social Networks. In ACM SIGIR Conference, Boston, MA, USA, July 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the link in question may lead to an online survey site, a password-protected archive file with instructions leading to the aforementioned survey (though the survey, and the archive file itself, is worthless and doesn't contain the file in question at all), or in extreme cases, [[malware]].&lt;ref name="ts3scam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webuser.co.uk/news/top-stories/492134/toy-story-3-movie-scam-warning|title=Toy Story 3 movie scam warning|work=Web User magazine|accessdate=23 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511114246/http://www.webuser.co.uk/news/top-stories/492134/toy-story-3-movie-scam-warning|archivedate=11 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others may upload videos presented in an [[infomercial]]-like format selling their product which feature actors and paid [[testimonial]]s, though the promoted product or service is of dubious quality and would likely not pass the scrutiny of a [[standards and practices]] department at a [[television station]] or [[cable network]].

===SPIT===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
[[VoIP spam|SPIT (SPam over Internet Telephony)]] is [[VoIP|VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)]] spam, usually using [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)]]. This is nearly identical to telemarketing calls over traditional phone lines. When the user chooses to receive the spam call, a pre-recorded spam message or advertisement is usually played back. This is generally easier for the spammer as VoIP services are cheap and easy to anonymize over the Internet, and there are many options for sending mass number of calls from a single location. Accounts or IP addresses being used for VoIP spam can usually be identified by a large number of outgoing calls, low call completion and short call length.

===Academic search===
[[List of academic databases and search engines|Academic search engines]] enable researchers to find [[academic literature]] and are used to obtain citation data for calculating performance metrics such as the [[H-index]] and [[impact factor]]. Researchers from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg|OvGU]] demonstrated that most (web-based) academic search engines, especially [[Google Scholar]], are not capable of identifying spam attacks.&lt;ref name=acspam&gt;Joeran Beel and Bela Gipp. Academic search engine spam and google scholar’s resilience against it. Journal of Electronic Publishing, 13(3), December 2010. [http://www.sciplore.org/publications/2010-Academic_search_engine_spam_and_Google_Scholars_resilience_against_it_-_preprint.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers manipulated the citation counts of articles, and managed to make Google Scholar index complete fake articles, some containing advertising.&lt;ref name=acspam /&gt;

===Mobile apps===
Spamming in mobile app stores  include (i) apps that were automatically generated and as a result do not have any specific functionality or a meaningful description; (ii) multiple instances of the same app being published to obtain increased visibility in the app market; and (iii) apps that make excessive use of unrelated keywords to attract users through unintended searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seneviratne|first1=Suranga|title=Spam Mobile Apps: Characteristics, Detection, and in the Wild Analysis|journal=ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB)|date=Apr 2017|volume=11|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noncommercial forms==
E-mail and other forms of spamming have been used for purposes other than advertisements. Many early Usenet spams were religious or political. [[Serdar Argic]], for instance, spammed Usenet with historical revisionist screeds. A number of [[evangelism|evangelists]] have spammed [[Usenet]] and e-mail media with preaching messages. A growing number of criminals are also using spam to perpetrate various sorts of fraud.&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Advance fee fraud]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical origins==
In 2011 the origins of spam were analyzed by [[Cisco Systems]]. They provided a report that shows spam volume originating from countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/vpndevc/security_annual_report_2011.pdf Cisco 2011 Annual Security Report ] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trademark issues==
[[Hormel Foods Corporation]], the maker of [[Spam (food)|SPAM]] luncheon meat, does not object to the Internet use of the term "spamming". However, they did ask that the capitalized word "Spam" be reserved to refer to their product and trademark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tmcases/hormel.htm | title = Hormel Foods Corp. v. Jim Henson Prods | id = 73 F.3d 497 (2d Cir. 1996) | publisher = Harvard University | accessdate = 2015-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; By and large, this request is obeyed in forums that discuss spam.

==Cost–benefit analyses==
The [[European Union]]'s Internal Market Commission estimated in 2001 that "junk email" cost Internet users €10 billion per year worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/01/154&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title= Data protection: "Junk" email costs internet users 10 billion a year worldwide – Commission study |publisher= Europa | accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The California legislature found that spam cost United States organizations alone more than $13 billion in 2007, including lost productivity and the additional equipment, software, and manpower needed to combat the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.spamlaws.com/state/ca.shtml |title=California business and professions code |publisher= Spamlaws |accessdate= 2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spam's direct effects include the consumption of computer and network resources, and the cost in human time and attention of dismissing unwanted messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.commtouch.com/spam-cost-calculator |title=Spam Cost Calculator: Calculate enterprise spam cost? |publisher=Commtouch |accessdate = 2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Large companies who are frequent spam targets utilize numerous techniques to detect and prevent spam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Shuman | last = Ghosemajumder | url = http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/using-data-to-help-prevent-fraud.html | title =Using data to help prevent fraud |author-link = Shuman Ghosemajumder |publisher=[[Google Blog]] |accessdate=12 August 2011 | date =18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost to providers of [[Web search engine|search engines]] is significant: "The secondary consequence of spamming is that search engine indexes are inundated with useless pages, increasing the cost of each processed query".&lt;ref name=Gyongyi/&gt; 
The costs of spam also include the collateral costs of the struggle between spammers and the administrators and users of the media threatened by spamming.&lt;!-- This is incomplete --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051220115414/http://linxnet.com/misc/spam/thank_spammers.html Thank the Spammers] - ''William R. James''
2003-03-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Email spam exemplifies a [[tragedy of the commons]]: spammers use resources (both physical and human), without bearing the entire cost of those resources.  In fact, spammers commonly do not bear the cost at all.  This raises the costs for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Journal of Economic Perspectives|url=https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.26.3.87|title=Economics of Spam}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some ways spam is even a potential [[threat (computer)|threat]] to the entire email system, as operated in the past.  Since email is so cheap to send, a tiny number of spammers can saturate the Internet with junk mail.  Although only a tiny percentage of their targets are motivated to purchase their products (or fall victim to their scams), the low cost may provide a sufficient conversion rate to keep the spamming alive. Furthermore, even though spam appears not to be economically viable as a way for a reputable company to do business, it suffices for professional spammers to convince a tiny proportion of gullible advertisers that it is viable for those spammers to stay in business.  Finally, new spammers go into business every day, and the low costs allow a single spammer to do a lot of harm before finally realizing that the business is not profitable{{cn|date=August 2018}}.

Some companies and groups "rank" spammers; spammers who make the news are sometimes referred to by these rankings.&lt;ref&gt;Spamhaus' [http://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/networks.lasso  "TOP 10 spam service ISPs"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/spammers.lasso |title = The 10 Worst ROKSO Spammers |publisher = Spamhaus | accessdate =2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General costs===
In all cases listed above, including both commercial and non-commercial, "spam happens" because of a positive [[cost-benefit analysis]] result; if the cost to recipients is excluded as an [[externality]] the spammer can avoid paying.

'''Cost''' is the combination of
* Overhead: The costs and overhead of electronic spamming include bandwidth, developing or acquiring an email/wiki/blog spam tool, taking over or acquiring a host/zombie, etc.
* [[Transaction cost]]: The incremental cost of contacting each additional recipient once a method of spamming is constructed, multiplied by the number of recipients (see [[CAPTCHA]] as a method of increasing transaction costs).
* Risks: Chance and severity of legal and/or public reactions, including [[damages]] and [[punitive damages]].
* Damage: Impact on the community and/or communication channels being spammed (see [[Newsgroup spam]]).

'''Benefit''' is the total expected profit from spam, which may include any combination of the commercial and non-commercial reasons listed above. It is normally linear, based on the incremental benefit of reaching each additional spam recipient, combined with the [[conversion rate]]. The conversion rate for [[botnet]]-generated spam has recently been measured to be around one in 12,000,000 for pharmaceutical spam and one in 200,000 for infection sites as used by the [[Storm botnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| last = Kanich | first = C. |author2=C. Kreibich |author3=K. Levchenko |author4=B. Enright |author5=G. Voelker |author6=V. Paxson |author7=S.

The authors of the study calculating those conversion rates noted, "After 26 days, and almost 350 million e-mail messages, only 28 sales resulted."

==In crime==
Spam can be used to spread [[computer virus]]es, [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horses]] or other malicious software. The objective may be [[identity theft]], or worse (e.g., [[advance fee fraud]]). Some spam attempts to capitalize on human greed, while some attempts to take advantage of the victims' inexperience with computer technology to trick them (e.g., [[phishing]]).

On May 31, 2007, one of the world's most prolific spammers, [[Robert Alan Soloway]], was arrested by US authorities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lombardi |first=Candace |url=http://www.news.com/Alleged-Seattle-Spammer-arrested/2100-7348_3-6187754.html |title=Alleged 'Seattle Spammer' arrested - CNET |publisher=News.com |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as one of the top ten spammers in the world, Soloway was charged with 35 criminal counts, including mail fraud, wire fraud, [[e-mail fraud]], aggravated identity theft, and money laundering.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Prosecutors allege that Soloway used millions of [[zombie computer|"zombie" computers]] to distribute spam during 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Claburn, Thomas.

InformationWeek.com [http://www.informationweek.com/spam-king-robert-alan-soloway-pleads-guilty/d/d-id/1065753?], 3/17/2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first case in which US prosecutors used identity theft laws to prosecute a spammer for taking over someone else's Internet domain name.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

In an attempt to assess potential legal and technical strategies for stopping illegal spam, a study  cataloged three months of online spam data and researched website naming and hosting infrastructures. The study concluded that: 1) half of all spam programs have their domains and servers distributed over just eight percent or fewer of the total available hosting registrars and autonomous systems, with 80 percent of spam programs overall being distributed over just 20 percent of all registrars and autonomous systems; 2) of the 76 purchases for which the researchers received transaction information, there were only 13 distinct banks acting as credit card acquirers and only three banks provided the payment servicing for 95 percent of the spam-advertised goods in the study; and, 3) a "financial blacklist" of banking entities that do business with spammers would dramatically reduce monetization of unwanted e-mails. Moreover, this blacklist could be updated far more rapidly than spammers could acquire new banking resources, an asymmetry favoring anti-spam efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~savage/papers/Oakland11.pdf |title = Click Trajectories: End-to-End Analysis of the Spam Value Chain |author = Levchenko, Kirill|author2= et. al.| work=2011 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy|date=2011|pages=431–446|doi=10.1109/SP.2011.24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political issues==
An ongoing concern expressed by parties such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] has to do with so-called "stealth blocking", a term for ISPs employing aggressive spam blocking without their users' knowledge. These groups' concern is that ISPs or technicians seeking to reduce spam-related costs may select tools that (either through error or design) also block non-spam e-mail from sites seen as "spam-friendly". Few object to the existence of these tools; it is their use in filtering the mail of users who are not informed of their use that draws fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url=http://www.anti-abuse.org/rbl-criticism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though it is possible in some jurisdictions to treat some spam as unlawful merely by applying existing laws against [[trespass]] and [[conversion (law)|conversion]], some laws specifically targeting spam have been proposed. In 2004, United States passed the [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]] that provided ISPs with tools to combat spam. This act allowed [[Yahoo!]] to successfully sue Eric Head who settled the lawsuit for several thousand U.S. dollars in June 2004. But the law is criticized by many for not being effective enough. Indeed, the law was supported by some spammers and organizations that support spamming, and opposed by many in the anti-spam community.

Earthlink won a $25 million judgment against one of the most notorious and active "spammers" Khan C.

In 2007, [[Robert Soloway]] lost a case in a federal court against the operator of a small Oklahoma-based Internet service provider who accused him of spamming. U.S. Judge Ralph G.

The judgment includes a statutory damages award of about $10 million under Oklahoma law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mortgagespam.com/soloway Braver v.

The trial, which began on June 5, was the first to include charges under the [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]], according to a release from the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].

Edna Fiedler, 44, of [[Olympia, Washington]], on June 25, 2008, pleaded guilty in a [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] court and was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment and 5 years of supervised release or [[probation]] in an Internet $1 million "Nigerian check scam." She conspired to commit bank, wire and mail fraud, against US citizens, specifically using Internet by having had an [[accomplice]] who shipped counterfeit checks and money orders to her from [[Lagos]], Nigeria, the previous November. Fiedler shipped out $609,000 fake check and money orders when arrested and prepared to send additional $1.1 million counterfeit materials. Also, the U.S. Postal Service recently intercepted counterfeit checks, lottery tickets and eBay overpayment schemes with a face value of $2.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2008/06/26/Woman_gets_prison_for_Nigerian_scam/UPI-73791214521169/ |title=Woman gets prison for 'Nigerian' scam |author= |work= |publisher=upi.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/147575/article.html |title=Woman Gets Two Years for Aiding Nigerian Internet Check Scam (PC World) |author= |work= |publisher=PC World |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 opinion, ''[[Gordon v. Virtumundo, Inc.]]'', 575 F.3d 1040, the Ninth Circuit assessed the standing requirements necessary for a private plaintiff to bring a civil cause of action against spam senders under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as well as the scope of the CAN-SPAM Act's federal preemption clause.&lt;ref name="Gordon2"&gt;{{Cite court |litigants=Gordon v.

===United Kingdom===
In the first successful case of its kind, [[Nigel Roberts]] from the [[Channel Islands]] won £270 against Media Logistics UK who sent junk e-mails to his personal account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/jersey/4562726.stm |title=Businessman wins e-mail spam case |date=27 December 2005 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, a Sheriff Court in Scotland awarded Mr. Gordon Dick £750 (the then maximum sum that could be awarded in a Small Claim action) plus expenses of £618.66, a total of £1368.66 against Transcom Internet Services Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotchspam.co.uk/transcom.html |title=Gordon Dick v Transcom Internet Service Ltd |publisher=Scotchspam.co.uk |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; for breaching anti-spam laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0058:EN:HTML |title=Article 13-Unsolicited communications |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transcom had been legally represented at earlier hearings, but were not represented at the proof, so Gordon Dick got his decree by default. It is the largest amount awarded in compensation in the United Kingdom since Roberts v Media Logistics case in 2005.

Despite the statutory tort that is created by the Regulations implementing the EC Directive, few other people have followed their example. As the Courts engage in active case management, such cases would probably now be expected to be settled by mediation and payment of nominal damages.

===New Zealand===
In October 2008, an international internet spam operation run from New Zealand was cited by American authorities as one of the world’s largest, and for a time responsible for up to a third of all unwanted e-mails. In a statement the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) named Christchurch’s Lance Atkinson as one of the principals of the operation. New Zealand’s Internal Affairs announced it had lodged a $200,000 claim in the High Court against Atkinson and his brother [[Shane Atkinson]] and courier Roland Smits, after raids in Christchurch. This marked the first prosecution since the Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act (UEMA) was passed in September 2007.
The FTC said it had received more than three million complaints about spam messages connected to this operation, and estimated that it may be responsible for sending billions of illegal spam messages. The US District Court froze the defendants’ assets to preserve them for consumer redress pending trial.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_675386"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/675386 |title=Kiwi spam network was 'World's biggest' |date=16 October 2008 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
U.S. co-defendant Jody Smith forfeited more than $800,000 and faces up to five years in prison for charges to which he pleaded guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/11/herbalkings.shtm |title=Court Orders Australia-based Leader of International Spam Network to Pay $15.15 Million |publisher=Ftc.gov |date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bulgaria===
While most countries either outlaw or at least ignore spam, [[Bulgaria]] is the first and until now{{when|date=May 2014}} only one {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}to legalize it. According to the Bulgarian E-Commerce act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lex.bg/bg/laws/ldoc/2135530547 |title=Закон За Електронната Търговия |publisher=Lex.bg |date=2011-08-14 |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Чл.5,6) anyone can send spam to mailboxes published as owned by a company or organization, as long as there is a "clear and straight indication that the message is unsolicited commercial e-mail" ("да осигури ясното и недвусмислено разпознаване на търговското съобщение като непоискано") in the message body.

This made lawsuits against Bulgarian ISP's and public e-mail providers with antispam policy possible, as they are obstructing legal commerce activity and thus violate Bulgarian antitrust acts. While there are no such lawsuits until now, several cases of spam obstruction are currently awaiting decision in the Bulgarian Antitrust Commission (Комисия за защита на конкуренцията) and can end with serious fines for the ISP's in question.{{when|date=May 2014}}{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The law contains other dubious provisions&amp;nbsp;— for example, the creation of a nationwide public electronic register of e-mail addresses that do not want to receive spam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kzp.bg/register/ |title=Регистър на юридическите лица, които не желаят да получават непоискани търговски съобщения |publisher=Kzp.bg |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually abused as the perfect source for [[e-mail address harvesting]], because publishing invalid or incorrect information in such a register is a criminal offense in Bulgaria.

[[File:SSWC logo 2011 mashup.png|thumb|[[Logo]] for Sweden Social Web Camp 2011]]
'''Sweden Social Web Camp''' (SSWC) is a Swedish user-generated conference (or [[unconference]]) held on the island of [[Tjärö]]. The event focuses on internet and web technology and use in the context of social media. The format is open, participatory workshop-events, the content which is provided by the participants. As anyone can decide to run a workshop during the event other, non-social web, subjects have of course turned up on the unconference grid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F_ZR7INykg #SSWC Hur en wall blir till] (How the grid is created), time laps video of unconference grid creation&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:SSWC 2011 - The “Save the world” workshop.jpg|thumb|right|Workshop at SSWC 2011]]
In 2009 [[Tomas Wennström]] and [[Kristin Heinonen]] told some friends via their blog that they were considering meeting up a few people on an island and talk about the social web. Within hours they had nearly a hundred replies from people who wanted to come and they decided that they should try to do something for a wider audience. Eventually 286 &lt;ref&gt;[http://commersen.lokaltidningen.se/article/20090825/ARTIKLER/209391054/2012 Revolution på Tjärö] (Revolution on Tjärö), Commersen, 25 August 2009, retrieved 16 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; people attended a two-day Sweden Social Web Camp in 2009 and workshops on about 60 different topics &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedensocialwebcamp.com/about-2/ About Sweden Social Web Camp], retrieved 16 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 409 people attended Sweden Social Web Camp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/teknik/camp-for-internetentusiaster Camp för internetentusiaster] (Camp for internet enthusiasts), DN.se, 13 August 2010, retrieved 16 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A book, SSWC-boken, was crowd sourced by Mattias Boström and 180+ essays making up 591 pages was printed and sold at the event. Many of the essays were also workshop topics at the event itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mattiasbostrom.se/2010/08/13/sswc-boken-2010-ladda-ned-eboken-och-bestall-pappersboken/ SSWC-boken] (The SSWC book), 13 August 2010, retrieved on 16 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 about 400 people attended &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/nyheter/kunskap-skapas-bast-genom-att-delta Kunskap skapas bäst genom att delta] (Knowledge is best created by participating),  DN.se, retrieved 16 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; an expanded format where an extra day was added and the agenda for the first day was crowd-sourced beforehand and voted on. By some, this year was considered the best year so far.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resume.se/nyheter/2011/08/15/vuxenhajk-for-webbnordar/ Vuxenhajk för webbnördar], (Field trip for grownup web nerds), Resume, retrieved 16 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
[[File:SSWC 2011 - Grid-Saturday.jpg|thumb|right|The unconference grid at SSWC 2011]]
The first two years (2009, 2010) was held as a traditional [[unconference]] where the content was decided by the participants on the spot, booking locations on the island using the [[unconference grid]].
The third year an extra day was added and the suggested topics were crowd-sourced beforehand and an online voting system was used to vote for the most popular topics. The 35 topics with the highest votes were allocated a slot on the first day.

Organised travel, called the Twittering buses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://internetworld.idg.se/2.1006/1.397711/twittrande-bussar-pa-vag-soderut Twittrande bussar på väg söderut] (Twittering buses on their way south), Internetworld, retrieved 16 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; contributes to the event and many consider travelling with the buses an essential part of the experience.

'''''The Ballad of Baby Doe''''' is an opera by the American composer [[Douglas Moore]] that uses an English-language libretto by [[John La Touche (musician)|John Latouche]]. It is Moore's most famous opera and one of the few American operas to be in the standard repertory. Especially famous are the title heroine's five arias: "Letter Aria," "Willow Song," "I Knew it Was Wrong", "Gold is a Fine Thing", and "Always Through the Changing."  Horace Tabor's "Warm as the Autumn Light" is also frequently heard. Distinguished sopranos who have portrayed Baby Doe include [[Beverly Sills]] (Moore's favorite interpreter of the role), [[Karan Armstrong]], [[Faith Esham]], and [[Elizabeth Futral]].

The opera's premiere took place at the [[Central City Opera]] in Colorado in 1956. [[Hanya Holm]] and Edwin Levy directed  the production, and sopranos [[Dolores Wilson]] and Leyna Gabriele alternated in the title role. The opera's New York premiere, directed by [[Vladimir Rosing]], was presented at the [[New York City Opera]] in 1958 in a revised version which added the gambling scene in Act 2 and an additional aria for Baby Doe. At the time, further revisions were being considered, but these were abandoned upon the sudden death of Latouche.

== Story ==

Based on the lives of actual historical figures [[Horace Tabor]], [[Baby Doe Tabor|Elizabeth "Baby" Doe Tabor]], and [[Augusta Tabor]], the opera  tracks their lives from Horace and Baby Doe's meeting to the death of Horace.  "Always Through the Changing" is a postscript ending foretelling Baby's death.

== Act I ==

Scene 1

The story begins by commenting on the riches of the Matchless Mine and on how Horace Tabor owns the whole town of [[Leadville, Colorado]].  Horace sings "It's a Bang Up Job" to the townspeople, praising his new opera house and sharing his disenchantment with his wife Augusta.  During intermission at a performance at the opera house, Augusta chides Horace for not acting in accordance to his station in life. Horace pleads with her not to insult the common people, equating the prostitutes' and bar girls' work to the work her committee did in helping build the opera house.  Near the end of intermission, a woman arrives, introduces herself to Horace and asks if he could direct her to her hotel.  He obliges her, and returns to the opera with Augusta.

Scene 2

Augusta retires for the evening, while Horace steps outside to smoke a cigar.  He overhears two women speaking about the woman and learns that her name is Baby Doe, and that she has a husband in Central City.  Horace hears Baby singing "The Willow Song" and applauds her—much to her surprise since she did not know he was listening.  He sings "Warm as the Autumn Light" to her.  Augusta's comments from upstairs stop the scene.

Scene 3
 
Several months later, Augusta goes through Horace's study and finds gloves and a love letter.  She thinks they are for her until she finally realizes that they are for Baby Doe.  The rumors have been true.  Horace comes in, they fight and Horace says he never meant to hurt her.

Scene 4

Baby Doe, at the hotel, realizes she must end her relationship with Horace and tells the hotel workers to find out when the next train leaves for [[Denver]].  The hotel workers go to find Horace so he can head her off.  She sings of her love for Horace in a letter to her mother (the "Letter Aria").  Augusta comes in and tells Baby to leave. She agrees, but pleads that she and Horace have done nothing they should be ashamed of ("I Knew It Was Wrong").  When Augusta leaves, Baby decides against leaving at the same time Horace comes in.  They sing of their love.

Scene 5

A year later, Tabor has left Augusta and is living with Baby Doe. Her friends inform Augusta, now living in Denver, that Horace plans to divorce her. She swears to ruin him.

Scene 6

Horace and Baby Doe's wedding party in [[Washington DC]].  Baby's mother praises the couple's riches, but the society wives deride Baby Doe. However, when the couple comes in they are well received.  The debate turns to the [[silver standard]] and Baby Doe sings "Gold is a Fine Thing".  Horace then presents Baby with [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]]'s diamond necklace.  Baby Doe's mother tells the [[Roman Catholic]] priest about Baby and Horace's divorces—which he didn't know of.  Scandal rocks the party, but is stopped when [[President of the United States]] [[Chester Arthur]] comes in and toasts the couple.

== Act II ==
Act II chronicles the disintegration of Baby and Horace's riches.  Augusta warns of the [[gold standard]], but Horace doesn't listen.  Horace politically backs [[William Jennings Bryan]] for president.  When Bryan loses, Horace is abandoned by his party.

In the final scenes, Horace asks to see the opera house he built so long ago, though he no longer owns it.  On the stage, he hallucinates and sees people from his past.  Augusta both taunts and pleads with him.  He is told that his one daughter will decry the name Tabor and that his other will become a prostitute.  Distraught, he collapses.  Baby Doe enters.  After he is convinced that she is not a hallucination, he tells her nothing will come between them and begs her to remember him.  He dies in her arms. In the last scene that takes place 30 years later, at the Matchless Mine, she finishes the opera with "Always Through the Changing."

The '''Theater in der Leopoldstadt''' (also: '''Leopoldstädter Theater''') was an opera house in Vienna, founded in 1781 by [[Karl von Marinelli]], following the ''Schauspielfreiheit'' (ending of the court's monopoly on entertainment) by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in 1776. The 19th-century summer stage called the Thaliatheater was also managed by the Leopoldstadt.

In its early years, the theatre staged [[Singspiel]]e and [[Posse mit Gesang|Possen mit Gesang]], notably by the theatre's [[Kapellmeister]] [[Wenzel Müller]] and his assistant [[Ferdinand Kauer]]. The dramatist [[Ferdinand Raimund]] worked with the theatre in the 1820s.

The theatre was eventually demolished and rebuilt in 1847, under the name of the [[Carltheater]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5540">{{Chinese salvationism}}
The '''doctrine of the Three Suns''' ({{zh|c=三阳|p=sānyáng}}) or '''three stages of the end-time''' ({{zh|c=三期末劫|p=sānqímòjié}}), or '''Three Ages''',&lt;ref&gt;Tay, 2010. p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[teleology|teleological]] and [[eschatology|eschatological]] doctrine found in some [[Chinese salvationist religions]] and schools of [[Confucianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Tay, 2010. p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the doctrine, the [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute principle]], in many salvationist sects represented as the [[Wusheng Laomu]], divides the [[end time]] into three stages, each of which is governed by a different Buddha sent by the Mother to save humanity: the "Green Sun" (''qingyang'') governed by [[Dīpankara Buddha]], the "Red Sun" (''hongyang'') by [[Gautama Buddha]], and the current "White Sun" (''baiyang'') by [[Maitreya]].&lt;ref&gt;Seiwert, 2003. p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; In different sects the three periods are known by slightly different names, variations originated by oral transmission of the teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Seiwert, 2003. p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine is especially important in the [[Xiantiandao]] group of sects, the most notable one being [[Yiguandao]].

==Origins==
The Three Suns doctrine places itself in a sect tradition ("Sanyangism", 三阳教 ''Sānyángjiào'', "teaching of the Three Suns") flourishing at least since the [[Ming dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Seiwert, 2003. p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; It can be traced back to a [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[Taoist schools|school]] named ''Hunyuan'', from the concept of ''hunyuan'' ("original chaos") that existed before ''[[hundun]]'' ("still chaos") and is the beginning of primordial ''[[qi]]'' (''yuanqi'') according to some Taoist cosmologies.&lt;ref&gt;Seiwert, 2003. p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible origins go back to the entry of [[Mileism|Maitreya beliefs]] into [[China]]. These concepts became part of the folk tradition and were incorporated in the sect ''milieu''.&lt;ref&gt;Seiwert, 2003. p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest sects of the Ming period, the Lord of Original Chaos (''Hunyuan Zhu'') represents the origin of the universe developing through three stages, ''yang'', or cosmic periods.&lt;ref&gt;Seiwert, 2003. p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest written evidence of this doctrine can be found in the ''Huangji jieguo baojuan'', published in 1430.&lt;ref&gt;Seiwert, 2003. p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; In this text the three stages are already associated to the three Buddhas: [[Dipankara]], [[Gautama]] and [[Maitreya]].&lt;ref&gt;Seiwert, 2003. p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; The Green Sun Assembly was held at the end of the first period, the Red Sun Assembly in the second one and the White Sun Assembly will be held in the third one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inspiration: The Organization and Ideology of White Lotus Sects|url=https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/5983/Part1.pdf?sequence=11|author=Naquin, Susan|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=1976|accessdate=6 February 2014}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confucian doctrine==
The doctrine of the Three Ages is discussed in [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] and [[New Confucianism|New Confucian]] teachings, the ''Gongyang Commentary'' and the ''Datong shu'' of [[Kang Youwei]].&lt;ref&gt;Tay, 2010. p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; The Confucian interpretation is comparable to the doctrine of the Spirit in [[Hegelian]] thought.&lt;ref&gt;Tay, 2010. p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]]'' ("humaneness", the essence of human being) develops and matures progressively to higher stages in history.&lt;ref&gt;Tay, 2010. p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Kang saw history as progressing from an Age of Disorder to the Age of Approaching Peace, and ending at the Age of Universal Peace.&lt;ref&gt;Tay, 2010. p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In the third age humankind attains ''Datong'', ''ren'' is fully realised as people transcend their selfishness and become one with "[[Tian|all under Heaven]]".&lt;ref&gt;Tay, 2010. p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yiguandao doctrine==
Currently, Yiguandao doctrine about Three Ages is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsgd.url.tw/e/page/e005.html 三期末劫與三曹普渡], 2009, Retrieved 6 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trần Hưng Đạo''' ({{IPA-vi|ʈə̂n hɨŋ ɗâːwˀ|lang}}; 1228&amp;ndash;1300), also known as Grand Prince Hưng Đạo, was an imperial prince, statesman and military commander of [[names of Vietnam|Đại Việt]] during the [[Trần Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Carine Lall, Edward Vickers ''Education As a Political Tool in Asia'' 2009 - Page 144 "... to the official national autobiography, the legends relating to the origins of the nation are complemented by other legends of heroes in order to constitute the Vietnamese nation's pantheon: Hai Bà Trưng, Lý Thường Kiệt, Trần Hưng Đạo, etc."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Lockhart, William J. DuikerThe A to Z of Vietnam p374 Trần Hưng Đạo&lt;/ref&gt;

Born Prince '''Trần Quốc Tuấn''' ([[wikt:陳|陳]][[wikt:國|國]][[wikt:峻|峻]]), he commanded the Đại Việt armies that repelled [[Mongol invasions of Vietnam|three major Mongol invasions]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/9.htm The Tran Dynasty and the Defeat of the Mongols]&lt;/ref&gt; His multiple victories over the [[Yuan Dynasty]] under [[Kublai Khan]] are considered among the greatest military feats in Vietnamese history. The Mongol forces were successful on land, but they struggled heavily with heat and disease; in addition to these factors, inexperience at naval warfare in 1287 rendered them incapable of occupying the country for good. Furthermore, General Trần Hưng Đạo’s military prowess has been reflected in many warfare treatises that he authored.

==Origins==
Prince Trần Quốc Tuấn was born right after the [[Trần Dynasty]] replaced the [[Lý Dynasty]] in 1225 AD, when the last Lý monarch [[Lý Chiêu Hoàng]] abdicated the throne in favour of her husband, [[Trần Thái Tông]]. Many in the Lý royal family accused the Trần family of usurpation, and in particular, the Imperial Regent [[Trần Thủ Độ]], who masterminded the overthrow of the Lý Dynasty. 

Trần Quốc Tuấn was born to Prince [[Trần Liễu]], the elder brother of the new child emperor, Trần Thái Tông. That same year, Trần Liễu-- the Empress Lý Chiêu Hoàng’s brother-in-law at the time-- was forced to defer his own wife (Trần Hưng Đạo’s mother) to his younger brother Emperor Thái Tông under pressure from Imperial Regent Trần Thủ Độ to solidify Trần clan’s dynastic stability. The brothers Trần Liễu and Emperor Trần Thái Tông harboured grudges against their uncle Trần Thủ Độ for the forced marital arrangement.

Trần Quốc Tuấn, his father Trần Liễu, and Emperor Trần Thái Tông had a very close relationship. Liễu would find great tutors to teach his son, Trần Quốc Tuấn, with the hope of one day becoming a great leader of Đại Việt and regain his family honour. On his deathbed, Liễu told his son to avenge what he felt was personal shame forced upon him and his brother, Trần Thái Tông, by the Imperial Regent Tran Thu Do.

==The first Mongol invasion==
{{Infobox Chinese
|vie= Trần Hưng Đạo
|hn= {{linktext|陳|興|道}}

In 1226 AD, Trần Thủ Độ arranged for Tran Canh to become Emperor (Queen Ly Chieu Hoang abdicated in favour of her husband, [[Trần Cảnh]]). The Trần Dynasty took the place of the Ly Dynasty and Trần Cảnh became Emperor Trần Thái Tông. Soon after assuming the imperial throne, the Trần Dynasty single-mindedly and systematically eliminated other political factions in the country and thereby further consolidated their power.&lt;ref name="The National Hero: General Trần Hưng Đạo"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the Mongols succeeded in conquering most of Central Asia and Eastern Europe; they marched south in order to invade [[Kingdom of Dali|Dali]] and Song. After the Mongols wiped out Dali in 1254 AD, they sent emissaries to Đại Việt (North Vietnam) to demand free passage through the country for their armies who en route to attack the Song.  The Trần Emperor, suspecting that the demand was a ruse for a Mongol invasion, refused. In 1257, the Mongols invaded Đại Việt, marking the first war between the two nations. According Việt official histories, Trần Hưng Đạo served in that war as an officer commanding troops on the frontier. The histories did not record the extent to which Trần Hưng Đạo influenced on the course of the war.

The Mongol general Uriyangkhadai invaded Đại Việt in 1257 at the head of a modest army while the main Mongol forces were invading Song China. Uriyangkhadai defeated the Đại Việt army at the battle of No Nguyen/Viet Tri, and won another victory during the pursuit at Phu Lo bridge. The bulk of the Việt army fled the imperial capital. Though Uriyangkhadai had won initial victories, his troops struggled with the tropical heat and diseases endemic to the region, critical reasons for later Mongol problems in Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, Việt forces were mainly intact. In early 1258, as the Mongols had been heavily weakened by heat, diseases and lack of supplies, Emperor Trần Thái Tông along with Crown Prince Trần Hoảng made an effective counterattack on Thăng Long. The Mongols fled to [[Yunnan]], suffering further casualties due to ambushes by ethnic minorities on border areas.&lt;ref&gt;Descending Dragon, Rising Tiger: A History of Vietnam By Vu Hong Lien, Peter Sharrock.&lt;/ref&gt; Having successfully repelling the Mongol invasion, the Đại Việt Emperor sent an embassy to send tribute to the Mongols in order to avoid larger and more destructive invasions.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Rossabi, Khubilai Khan: His Life and Times, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile,  Trần Hưng Đạo returned to his estate in Van Kiep.

==The second Mongol invasion==
In 1285, Kublai Khan demanded passage through Đại Việt for his Yuan army in order to invade of the Kingdom of [[Champa]] (in modern central Viet Nam). When the Đại Việt government refused, the [[Mongol]] army, led by [[Toghan (son of Kublai)|Prince Toghan]], attacked Đại Việt and captured the imperial capital Thăng Long (modern day [[Hanoi]]). The Emperor Emeritus [[Trần Thánh Tông]] and Emperor [[Trần Nhân Tông]] appointed Trần Hưng Đạo as the Commander-in-chief of the armies (''Quốc công tiết chế thống lĩnh chư quân''). The prince of Hưng Đạo initially built defensive lines the frontier areas, but those were rapidly broken by Toghan's armies. It was in that episode that his loyal servant, Yết Kiêu, saved him from being nearly captured by the Mongols. Then he retreated to [[Vạn Kiếp]], where he had a discussion with Emperor Trần Nhân Tông. The two agreed to call 200.000 troops from north-east areas to assemble in Vạn Kiếp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Ngô Sĩ Liên|authorlink=Ngô Sĩ Liên|title=[[Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư]]|edition=Nội các quan bản|year=1993|language=Vietnamese|publisher=Social Science Publishing House|location=Hanoi|pp=188-195.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, on 11 February 1285, Viet navy under the direct commander of the emperor and the prince of Hưng Đạo fought a huge battle with Toghan's fleet. The Yuan fleet suffered heavily but they managed to win the battle. Emperor Trần Nhân Tông and Prince of Hưng Đạo eventually retreated to the imperial capital, Thăng Long. The Yuan forces pursued to Thăng Long and broke its defenses; however, the prince of Hưng Đạo's troops kept the enemy at bay long enough for the two emperors to escape from the city with the imperial family and the bulk of the army. The prince of Hưng Đạo and other generals escorted the royal family, staying just ahead of the Mongol army in hot pursuit. The Yuan army effectively controlled most of Annam, and surrounded the remaining Dai Viet leadership on land; however the latter fled to an island. Despite their martial success, the Yuan forces struggled greatly with heat and disease. As a result, the Yuan forces again retreated to wait until colder weather.&lt;ref&gt;Descending Dragon, Rising Tiger: A History of Vietnam

==The third Mongol invasion==
In 1287, Kublai Khan this time sent one of his favorite sons, [[Toghan (son of Kublai)|Prince Toghan]] to lead another invasion campaign into Đại Việt with a determination to occupy and redeem the previous defeat. The Yuan Mongol and Chinese forces formed an even larger infantry, cavalry and naval fleet with the total strength estimated at 500,000 men according to the [need an original accounting of a source or book] original Viet history.

During the first stage of the invasion, the Mongols quickly defeated most of the Đại Việt troops that were stationed along the border. Prince Toghan's naval fleet devastated most of the naval force of General [[Trần Khánh Dư]] in Vân Đồn. Simultaneously, Prince Ariq-Qaya led his massive cavalry and captured Phú Lương and Đại Than garrisons, two strategic military posts bordering Đại Việt and China. The cavalry later rendezvous with Prince Toghan's navy in Vân Đồn. In response to the battle skirmish defeats at the hands of the Mongol forces, the Emperor Emeritus Trần Thánh Tông summoned General Trần Khánh Dư to be court-martialed for military failures, but the general managed to delayed reporting to the court and was able to regrouped his forces in Vân Đồn. The cavalry and fleet of Prince Toghan continued to advance into the imperial capital Thăng Long. Meanwhile, the trailing supply fleet of Prince Toghan, arriving at Vân Đồn a few days after General Trần Khánh Dư's had already occupied this strategic garrison, the Mongol supply fleet was ambushed and captured by General Trần Khánh Dư's forces. Khánh Dư was then pardoned by the Emperor Emeritus. The Mongol main occupying army quickly realized their support and supply fleet has been cut off.

The capture of the Mongol supply fleet at Vân Đồn along with the concurring news that General Trần Hưng Đạo had recaptured Đại Than garrison in the north sent the fast advancing Mongol forces into chaos. The Đại Việt forces unleashed guerrilla warfare on the weakened Mongol forces causing heavy casualties and destructions to the Yuan forces. However, the Mongols continued advancing into Thăng Long due to their massive cavalry strength, but by this time, the emperor decided to vacate Thăng Long to flee and he ordered the capital to be burned down so the Mongols wouldn't collect any spoils of war. The subsequent battle skirmishes between the Mongols and Đại Việt had mixed results: the Mongols won and captured Yên Hưng and Long Hưng provinces, but lost in the naval battles at Đại Bàng. Eventually, Prince Toghan decided to withdraw his naval fleet and consolidated his command on land battles where he felt the Mongol's superior cavalry would defeat the Đại Việt infantry and cavalry forces. Toghan led the cavalry through Nội Bàng while his naval fleet commander, Omar, directly launched the naval force along the [[Bạch Đằng River]] simultaneously.

===The Battle of Bạch Đằng River===
{{Main|Battle of Bạch Đằng (1288)}}

The Mongol naval fleet were unaware of the river's terrain. Days before this expedition, the Prince of Hưng Đạo predicted the Mongol's naval route and quickly deployed heavy unconventional traps of steel-tipped wooden stakes unseen during high tides along the Bạch Đằng River bed. When Omar ordered the Mongol fleet to retreat from the river, the Viet deployed smaller and more maneuverable vessels into agitating and luring the Mongol vessels into the riverside where the booby traps were waiting while it was still high tide. As the river tide on Bạch Đằng River receded, the Mongol vessels were stuck and sunk by the embedded steel-tipped stakes. Under the presence of the Emperor Emeritus Thánh Tông and Emperor Nhân Tông, the Viet forces led by the Prince of Hưng Đạo burned down an estimated 400 large Mongol vessels and captured the remaining naval crew along the river. The entire Mongol fleet was destroyed and the Mongol fleet admiral Omar was captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Ngô Sĩ Liên|authorlink=Ngô Sĩ Liên|title=[[Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư]]|edition=Nội các quan bản|year=1993|language=Vietnamese|publisher=Social Science Publishing House|location=Hanoi|pp=196-198.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cavalry force of Prince Toghan was more fortunate. They were ambushed along the road through [[Nội Bàng]], but his remaining force managed to escape back to China by dividing their forces into smaller retreating groups but most were captured or killed in skirmishes on the way back to the border frontier.

==Great loyalty==
Although the entire Trần army was under his control, he never showed any sign of defection from the Dynasty. One day, he wished to survey his trustworthy subordinates [[Dã Tượng]] and [[Yết Kiêu]]. He brought up the promises he made with his dying father [[Trần Liễu]] to usurp the throne of the Trần dynasty. His two loyal men responded:
:''"You may gain not only brief riches and luxury but also bad reputation for eternity. My Lord, have you not acquired enough riches and luxury? We would rather die as your lowly servants than live as unfaithful high rank officials."''

Quốc Tuấn was moved to tears and praised them. On another occasion, Quốc Tuấn asked his son Trần Quốc Hiền:
:''"A powerful man makes his name in history by seizing the entire country to pass it to his children, does my son have such ambition?" Tran Quoc Hien answered “Strangers should not do that, let alone people of the same bloodline.”''

Tran Quoc Tuan strongly agreed with his son. And one day, he asked his second child Trần Quốc Tảng the same thing. Trần Quốc Tảng said: 
:''"[[Emperor Wu of Liu Song|Emperor Gaozu of Song]] was a mere farmer, but he seized his opportunity and won the country for himself".'' 
Trần Quốc Tuấn was angered: 
:''"My own son is a rebellious subject".'' 
He drew his sword, ready to kill Quốc Tảng. Quốc Hiền begged for his brother's life. Quốc Tuấn spared Quốc Tảng, however ordered him to never see his father's face any more.

During the long retreat of the Viet army after heavy initial defeats in 1285, Trần Quốc Tuấn often escorted Emperor Emeritus [[Trần Thánh Tông]] and Emperor [[Trần Nhân Tông]]. People glared at his pointed staff and suspected that he might desire to harm the two Emperors. Quốc Tuấn then discarded the point and kept only the wooden staff. Historian [[Ngô Sĩ Liên]] wrote: 
{{cquote|''Man who bears great responsibility often are envied and suspected. He must remain loyal and be mindful of his situation, otherwise he would draw hostilities. Trần Quốc Tuấn was such a man.''}}

==Conferring titles==
[[File:Painting of Trần Hưng Đạo (1228 - 1300), Nguyễn dynasty, Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Painting of Trần Hưng Đạo, [[Nguyễn dynasty]].]]
Because he is greatly credited with having repelled three major Mongol invasions, the Emperor confers the position of Commander-in-chief of the armies on him and allows him to grant anyone titles as he wished. But Tran Quoc Tuan never used that privilege. When [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] forces attacked [[Đại Việt]], he asked rich people to provide provisions for his army but only rewarded them with nominal titles.

He recommended many men of great talents: Da Tuong, Yet Kieu, they were credited with killing Generals Omar and Sogetsu of Yuan army. Many other pillars of the Trần court: Phạm Ngũ Lão, Trần Thì Kiến, Trương Hán Siêu, Phạm Lãm, Trịnh Dũ, Ngô Sĩ Thường, Nguyễn Thế Trực, all of them were his former subordinates. They are all well known for their excellent skill in politics as well as intellects.

==Personality==
Being a member of the royal family, Trần Hưng Đạo was a man of intellect and was an accomplished poet. Poetry was his first and true passion. He would have pursued this course had not for the multiple Yuan Mongol invasion attempts into Đại Việt that spanned over sixty years during his lifetime.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Death==
In 1300 AD, he fell ill and died of natural causes at the age of 73. His body was cremated and his ashes were dispersed under his favorite oak tree he planted in his royal family estate near Thăng Long in accordance to his will. The Viet intended to bury him in a lavish royal mausouleum and official ceremony upon his death, but he declined in favour of a simplistic private ceremony. For his military brilliance in defending Đại Việt during his lifetime, The Emperor posthumously bestowed Trần Hưng Đạo the title of "Hưng Đạo Đại Vương" (Great Lord Hưng Đạo).

==Legacy==
Trần Hưng Đạo achieved his military success with an army largely constituted of poorly equipped volunteers and peasant conscripts against the mighty hordes of the Mongols who were at the apex of their power after conquering most of Asia.{{fact|date=March 2017}} His strategic brilliance had contributed much to this success.

Đại Việt's General Trần Hưng Đạo defeated the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] in two major campaigns. General Trần Hưng Đạo led an army of poorly equipped volunteers and peasant conscripts against the overstretched forces of the Mongol Empire. This, combined with losses against the Japanese in the [[Battle of Koan]], marked the end of the apex of Mongol power.{{fact|date=March 2017}} Trần Hưng Đạo defeated them with inventive military tactics by exploiting their traditional "raiding" style of warfare which relied on lightning-strike cavalry maneuverability. He is famous for arguably pioneering the "hit and run" warfare.{{fact|date=March 2017}} Trần Hưng Đạo was a master of strategic geographical war fighting, applying advantageous landscapes to stage battles in places such as dense forests or on waterfronts where enemy cavalry were mostly ineffective.

Most notable was his speech [[Proclamation to the Officers]], addressing his soldiers at the beginning of the Mongol Invasion in 1285.

His advice to Emperor Trần Anh Tông prior to his death in 1300 served several times as reference for most of Vietnamese in the struggle for independence:
"When the enemy advances roaring like fire and wind, it is easy to overcome them. If they use patience like the silkworm nibbling berry leaves without looking for a quick victory and without fleecing people, we need to have not only good generals but also an elaboration of adequate tactics like in a chess game. In any way, the army should be united, having only one heart like father and sons in a family, the people should be treated with humanity so we can guarantee deep roots and durable bases."
===Name of public venues===

The '''Vienna New Year's Concert''' ({{Lang|de|Neujahrskonzert der Wiener Philharmoniker}}) is an annual [[concert]] of [[classical music]] performed by the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] on the morning of [[New Year's Day]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].  The concert occurs at the [[Musikverein]] at 11:15.  The orchestra performs the same concert programme on 30 December, 31 December, and 1 January but only the last concert is regularly broadcast on radio and television.

==Music and setting==

The concert programmes always include pieces from the Strauss family—[[Johann Strauss I]], [[Johann Strauss II]], [[Josef Strauss]] and [[Eduard Strauss]].  On occasion, music principally of other Austrian composers, including [[Joseph Hellmesberger Jr.]], [[Joseph Lanner]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Otto Nicolai]] (the Vienna Philharmonic's founder), [[Emil von Reznicek]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Franz von Suppé]], and [[Karl Michael Ziehrer]] has featured in the programmes.  In 2009, music by [[Joseph Haydn]] was played for the first time, where the 4th movement of [[Symphony No. 45 (Haydn)|his "Farewell" Symphony]] marked the 200th anniversary of his death.  Other European composers such as [[Hans Christian Lumbye]], [[Jacques Offenbach]], [[Emile Waldteufel]], Richard Strauss, Verdi, and Tchaikovsky have been featured in recent programmes.

The announced programme contains approximately 14-20 compositions, and also three encores.  The announced programme includes [[waltz]]es, [[polka]]s, [[mazurka]]s, and [[march (music)|marches]].  Of the encores, the unannounced first encore is often a fast polka.  The second is Johann Strauss II's waltz ''[[The Blue Danube]]'', whose introduction is interrupted by applause of recognition and a New Year's greeting from the conductor and orchestra to the audience. The final encore is Johann Strauss I's [[Radetzky March]], during which the audience claps along under the conductor's direction. In this last piece, the tradition also calls for the conductor to start the orchestra as soon he steps onto the stage, before reaching the podium. The complete duration of the event is around two and a half hours.

[[File:Musikverein Wien3.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|"{{Lang|de|Goldener Saal}}" (Golden Hall) of the Musikverein]]
The concerts have been held in the "{{Lang|de|Goldener Saal}}" (Golden Hall) of the [[Musikverein]] since 1939. The television broadcast is augmented by [[ballet]] performances in selected pieces during the second part of the programme. The dancers come from the [[Vienna State Ballet]] and dance at different famous places in Austria, e.&amp;nbsp;g. [[Schönbrunn Palace]], [[Schloss Esterházy]], the [[Vienna State Opera]] or the Wiener Musikverein itself. In 2013, the costumes were designed by [[Vivienne Westwood]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/1385171398384/Tanz-das-Jahr---Das-Shooting Tanz das Jahr – Das Shooting], ''[[Der Standard]]'', 30 December 2013 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1980 until 2013, the flowers that decorated the hall were a gift from the city of [[Sanremo]], [[Liguria]], Italy. In 2014, the orchestra itself provided the flowers. Since 2014, the flowers have been arranged by the ''Wiener Stadtgärten''.  In 2017, the orchestra performed for the first time in new attire designed by [[Vivienne Westwood]] and [[Andreas Kronthaler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/arts/music/a-new-year-and-new-duds-for-the-vienna-philharmonic.html|title=A New Year, and New Duds, for the Vienna Philharmonic|date=29 December 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There had been a tradition of concerts on New Year's Day in Vienna since 1838, but not with music of the Strauss family. From 1928 to 1933 there were six New Years's concerts in the Musikverein, conducted by [[Johann Strauss III]]. These concerts were broadcast by the [[ORF (broadcaster)#Radio Verkehrs AG|RAVAG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ernsttheis.com/index.php?ILNKID=111&amp;iL=2&amp;State=12300&amp;ResetMI=1&amp;PHPSESSID=9uu6c6kjcdlidm7jkdeg0l2eu7|title=Ernst Theis|first=www.FaberMoldenhauer.de, Dresden,|last=Germany|date=15 February 2016|publisher=ernsttheis.com|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1939, [[Clemens Krauss]], with the support of Vienna Gauleiter [[Baldur von Schirach]], devised a New Years' concert which the orchestra dedicated to ''Kriegswinterhilfswerk'' ('Winter War Relief'), to improve morale at the front lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www1.wdr.de/stichtag/stichtag8814.html | title=31. Dezember 1939 – Erstes Neujahrskonzert der Wiener Philharmoniker | work=WDR | author= | date=31 December 2014 | accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After World War II, this concert survived, as the Nazi origins were largely forgotten, until more recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://diepresse.com/home/meinung/gastkommentar/4895204/Das-Neujahrskonzert-und-so-manch-unhaltbare-Legende | title=Das Neujahrskonzert und so manch unhaltbare Legende | work=Die Presse | author=Harald Walser | date=29 December 2015 | accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concert was first performed in 1939, and conducted by Clemens Krauss. For the first and only time, the concert was not given on New Year's Day, but instead on 31 December of that year. It was called then a special, or 'extraordinary' concert ({{Lang|de|Außerordentliches Konzert}}). Johann Strauss II was the only composer performed, in a modest program:
*"[[Morgenblätter]]", Op. 279, waltz
*"Annen-[[Polka]]", Op. 117, dedicated to [[Maria Anna of Savoy]]
*[[Csárdás]] from the opera ''[[Ritter Pázmán]]''
*"[[Kaiser-Walzer]]", Op. 437
*"[[Leichtes Blut]]", Polka schnell, Op. 319
*"Ägyptischer Marsch", Op. 335
*"[[G'schichten aus dem Wienerwald]]", Walzer, Op. 325
*"[[Pizzicato]]-Polka"
*"[[Perpetuum mobile]]", ein musikalischer Scherz, Op. 257
*Ouverture to the operetta ''[[Die Fledermaus]]''

=== Encores ===
There were no encores in 1939, and sources indicate that encores were not instituted until 1945. Clemens Krauss almost always included "Perpetuum mobile" either on the concert or as an encore. The waltz ''The Blue Danube'' was not performed until 1945, and then as an encore. The [[Radetzky March]] was first performed in 1946, as an encore. Until 1958, these last two pieces were often but not always given as encores. Since that year, their position as twin encores has become inviolable tradition, with two exceptions:
* In 1967, [[Willi Boskovsky]] made the ''Blue Danube'' part of his concert program.
* In 2005, [[Lorin Maazel]] and the orchestra concluded the program with the ''Blue Danube'', omitting the ''Radetzky March'' as a mark of respect to the victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]]. 
One unannounced encore is always placed before the ''Blue Danube'', and after the final announced work on the printed concert programme.

Boskovsky, [[concertmaster]] of the orchestra from 1936 until 1979, directed the Vienna New Year's concerts from 1955 to 1979. In 1980, [[Lorin Maazel]] became the first non-Austrian conductor of the concert. The orchestra subsequently changed practice, to choose a different conductor every year.  The first such choice was [[Herbert von Karajan]], for the 1987 concert.  Karajan's concert also featured the only invited guest artist in the history of the concert, [[Kathleen Battle]].

==Audience==
The concert is popular throughout Europe, and more recently around the world. The demand for tickets is so high that people have to pre-register one year in advance in order to participate in the drawing of tickets for the following year. Some seats are pre-registered by certain Austrian families and are passed down from generation to generation.

The event is televised by the Austrian national broadcasting service [[Österreichischer Rundfunk|ORF]] – from 1989 to 1993, 1997 to 2009, and again in 2011 under the direction of [[Brian Large]] – and relayed via the [[European Broadcasting Union]]'s [[Eurovision (network)|Eurovision]] network to most major broadcasting organizations in Europe. On 1 January 2013, for example, the concert was shown on [[ZDF]] in Germany, [[France 2]] in France, [[BBC Two]] in the United Kingdom, [[Rai 2]] in Italy (on some hours delay), [[RSI La 1]] in Switzerland, [[La 1 (Spain)|La 1]] in Spain, [[ČT2]] in the Czech Republic, [[RTP1]] in Portugal, and [[TVP2]] in Poland, among many other channels. The concert was again televised by ORF on 1 January 2015 and 1 January 2016. Estimated audience numbers are ~50 million, in 73 countries in 2012, 93 countries in 2017 and 95 countries in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derstandard.at/1324501441828/Konzertvorschau-Walzerenergie-fuer-den-Globus|title=Walzerenergie für den Globus|work=[[Der Standard]]|language=German|date=28 December 2011|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diepresse.com/home/kultur/klassik/4628139/Neujahrskonzert-2015_Jahr-der-Jubilaeen|title=Neujahrskonzert 2015: Jahr der Jubiläen|work=[[Die Presse]]|language=German|date=29 December 2014|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20171229_OTS0076/neujahrskonzert-der-wiener-philharmoniker-2018-orf-uebertraegt-zum-60-mal-live-im-tv|title=Neujahrskonzert der Wiener Philharmoniker 2018: ORF überträgt zum 60.

Outside Europe, the concert is also shown on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in the United States (beginning in 1985, as part of the performing arts anthology ''[[Great Performances]]'', in abridged form), [[China Central Television|CCTV]] in China since 1987, [[NHK]] in Japan since 1973, [[MetroTV]] in [[Indonesia]], [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] in South Korea, and [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] in Australia (on delay). Since 2006, the concert has also been broadcast to viewers in several African countries ([[Botswana]], [[Lesotho]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Namibia]], [[Swaziland]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]). In Latin America the concert is shown in Chile by [[La Red (Chilean TV channel)|La Red]], and in [[Guatemala]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Bolivia]]. Indonesia's [[MetroTV]] broadcasts the concert although it is delayed by 4 to 5 days.

The concert is also broadcast live by many radio stations in Europe, the United States, and around the world.

==Commercial recordings==

[[Decca Records]] made the first of the live commercial recordings, with the 1 January 1979 digital recording (their first digital LP releases) of the 25th anniversary of the New Year's Concert with Willi Boskovsky conducting the Vienna Philharmonic.

'''Wincon''' was a series of British [[science fiction]] conventions, initially envisaged as a one-off entry in the Unicon science fiction convention sequence (1980 onwards) but which subsequently took on a life of its own as an occasional event held at [[King Alfred's College]], [[Winchester]]. The first was held in 1988 (aka Unicon 9), the most recent in 1999. Guests have included [[Patrick Tilley]], [[Geoff Ryman]], [[Michael de Larrabeiti]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Josef Nesvadba]], [[Gwyneth Jones (novelist)|Gwyneth Jones]], [[Brian Stableford]], [[Colin Greenland]], [[Norman Spinrad]], [[James P. Hogan (writer)|Patrick Hogan]], [[Diana Wynne Jones]] and [[Warren Ellis]].

Although not officially the fourth Wincon, the 1997 [[Eastercon]] (held in Liverpool) was organised by most of the core group, which includes Phil Plumbly, John Richards, Peter Wright, [[Steve Green (science fiction activist)|Steve Green]], Andy Croft, Keith Cosslett and John Bark. Other committee members have included Mike Cheater, Joy Hibbert, Dave Rowley, Peter Cohen, Terry Hunt and Geoff Hill.

The guests at Intervention were [[Brian W Aldiss]], [[David Langford]], [[Octavia Butler]] and [[Jon Bing]]. The next instalment (back in St Alfred's College) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.emcit.com/emcit048.shtml#Wessex ''Emerald City #48'', August 1999: report on Wincon V by editor Cheryl Morgan: "It all began in a pub. Well, this is British fandom after all."&lt;/ref&gt; recognised this relationship by its title, "Wincon V"; it completed the circle by also being part of the Unicon cycle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cix.co.uk/~magician/unicon2000/programme.htm Comments on Wincon V, published on the website of Lexicon, the 2000 Unicon: "Last year's Unicon (Wincon V) had various quizzes, a cake competition and a great atmosphere in the bar (with several real ales on tap)".&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no current plans to revive the Wincon series, as many of the original organisers are now scattered across the UK, but it remains one of England's more significant regional [[science fiction conventions]].
