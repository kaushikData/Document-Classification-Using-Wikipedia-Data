'''Albert Venn Dicey''', [[Queen's Counsel|KC]], [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (4 February 1835 – 7 April 1922), usually cited as '''A. V.

The final revised edition was the 10th, 1959, edited by [[E. C. S. Wade]]: 
{{cite book|title=Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution|last=Dicey|first=A. V.|publisher=Macmillan|year=1959|edition=10|place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles it expounds are considered part of the uncodified [[British constitution]]. He became [[Vinerian Professor of English Law]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and a leading constitutional scholar of his day. Dicey popularised the phrase "[[rule of law]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Bingham|Bingham, Thomas]].  ''The Rule of Law'', p. 3 (Penguin 2010). See Dicey's ''An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'', p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; although its use goes back to the 17th century.

==Biography==
His father was Thomas Edward Dicey, [[senior wrangler]] in 1811 and proprietor of the ''Northampton Mercury'' and Chairman of the [[Midland Railway]]. His elder brother was [[Edward Dicey|Edward James Stephen Dicey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |publisher=Groom and Son
 |location=Bury St. Edmunds
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a cousin of [[Leslie Stephen]] and [[James Fitzjames Stephen]].

Dicey was educated at King's College School in London and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], graduating with Firsts in [[Classical Moderations|classical moderations]] in 1856 and in ''[[Literae Humaniores|literae humaniores]]'' in 1858. In 1860 he won a fellowship at [[Trinity College, Oxford]], which he forfeited upon his marriage in 1872.

He was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] by the [[Inner Temple]] in 1863, subscribed to the [[Jamaica Committee]] around 1865, and was appointed to the Vinerian Chair of [[English Law]] at Oxford in 1882. In his first major work, the seminal ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'' he outlined the principles of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] for which he is most known. He argued that the British Parliament was "an absolutely sovereign legislature" with the "right to make or unmake any law". In the book, he defined the term "[[constitutional law]]" as including "all rules which directly or indirectly affect the distribution or the exercise of the sovereign power in the state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=George |year=2010
 |title= Australian Constitutional Law and Theory
 |page=2
 |publisher=The Federation Press
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He understood that the freedom [[British subjects]] enjoyed was dependent on the [[sovereignty]] of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], the [[Judicial independence|impartiality of the courts]] free from governmental interference and the supremacy of the [[common law]]. In 1890, he [[Queen's Counsel|took silk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=26018 |date=28 January 1890 |page=475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later left Oxford and went on to become one of the first Professors of Law at the then new [[London School of Economics]]. There he published in 1896 his ''Conflict of Laws''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dicey |first=A.V. |title=A Digest of the Law of England with Reference to the Conflict of Laws; with Notes on American Cases by John Bassett Moore|place= London |publisher= Stevens and Sons Limited  |year= 1896|url=https://archive.org/stream/adigestlawengla01dicegoog#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate=April 6, 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}; {{cite book |last= Dicey |first=A.V. |title=A Digest of the Law of England with Reference to the Conflict of Laws |place= London |publisher= Stevens and Sons Limited  |edition= 2nd |year= 1908 |url=https://archive.org/stream/adigestlawengla00dicegoog#page/n3/mode/2up |accessdate=April 6, 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his death in 1922, [[Harold Laski]] memorialized him as "the most considerable figure in English jurisprudence since [[Frederic William Maitland|Maitland]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sugarman |first1=David |title=Review: The Legal Boundaries of Liberty: Dicey, Liberalism and Legal Science |journal=The Modern Law Review |date=1983 |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=102–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political position==
[[File:Albert Venn Dicey.jpg|thumb|upright|An undated photograph of Dicey from the [[Harvard Law School]] Library's Legal Portrait Collection]]

Dicey was receptive to [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s brand of individualist liberalism and welcomed the extension of the franchise in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Follett |first1=R. |title=Evangelicalism, Penal Theory and the Politics of Criminal Law: Reform in England, 1808-30 |date=2000 |publisher=Springer |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Saunders |first1=Robert |title=Democracy and the Vote in British Politics, 1848–1867: The Making of the Second Reform Act |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was affiliated with the group known as the "University Liberals" who composed the ''Essays on Reform'' and was not ashamed to be labeled a Radical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stapleton |first1=Julia |title=Political Intellectuals and Public Identities in Britain Since 1850 |date=2001 |publisher=Manchester University Press |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dicey held that "personal liberty is the basis of national welfare." He treated Parliamentary sovereignty as the central premise of the British constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weill |first1=Rivka |title=Dicey Was Not Diceyan |journal=The Cambridge Law Journal |date=2003 |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=474–493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dicey became a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]] and a vigorous opponent of [[Home Rule]] for [[Ireland]] and published and spoke against it extensively from 1886 until shortly before his death, advocating that no concessions be made to [[Irish nationalism]] in relation to the government of any part of Ireland as an integral part of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/60243925 Speech of Professor Dicey, at the Liberal Unionists' meeting, in the Music Hall, Birkenhead, 10 December 1887.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was thus bitterly disillusioned by the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] agreement in 1921 that [[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]] should become a self-governing [[dominion]] (the [[Irish Free State]]), separate from the United Kingdom.

Dicey was also vehemently opposed to [[women's suffrage]], [[proportional representation]] (while acknowledging that the existing [[first-past-the-post]] system wasn't perfect), and to the notion that citizens have the right to ignore unjust laws. Dicey viewed the necessity of establishing a stable [[legal system]] as more important than the potential injustice that would occur from following unjust laws. In spite of this, he did concede that there were circumstances in which it would be appropriate to resort to an armed rebellion but stated that such occasions are extremely rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontos04dicegoog|title=A.

The '''Accountable Capitalism Act''', 115th Congress (2017-2018) [https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3348/text S. 3348] is a proposed [[bill (United States Congress)|federal bill]] introduced by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Elizabeth Warren]] in August 2018. It would require that [[co-determination|employees elect]] 40% of a board of directors of any corporation with over $1 [[billion]] in tax receipts, and that 75% of shareholders and directors must approve any political spending. Corporations with revenue over $1 billion would be required to obtain a federal [[corporate charter]]. The Act contains a "[[constituency statute]]" that would give directors a duty of "creating a general public benefit" with regard to a corporations [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], including shareholders, employees, and the environment, and the interests of the enterprise in the long-term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Accountable%20Capitalism%20Act.pdf EHF18429 Accountable Capitalism Act] §§3, 5, 6, and 8. warren.senate.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
With the [[Reward Work Act]], the Accountable Capitalism Act is the second recent proposal to give employees a right to elect representatives on a company board of directors. The [[United States]] is in a minority of countries in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] that gives no representation of the workforce in [[corporate governance]].&lt;ref&gt;E McGaughey, 'Votes at Work in Britain: Shareholder Monopolisation and the ‘Single Channel’' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2432068 47(1) Industrial Law Journal 76], map of countries on page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill's explanatory document states that it seeks to borrow "from the successful approach in [[German labour law|Germany]] and other developed economies", by introducing that right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Accountable%20Capitalism%20Act%20One-Pager.pdf One-page explainer of the bill]. See also E McGaughey, 'The Codetermination Bargains: The History of German Corporate and Labour Law' (2016) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2579932 23(1) Columbia Journal of European Law 135]&lt;/ref&gt;

For years, Senator Warren endorsed the slogan "corporations are not people," in opposition to the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling. The Accountable Capitalism Act further distinguishes rights of individuals from those of corporations. The internet tabloid Vox wrote of Warren's proposal: "Warren's plan starts from the premise that [[corporate personhood|corporations that claim the legal rights of personhood]] should be legally required to accept the [[moral obligations]] of [[personhood]]."&lt;ref name=vox1/&gt; ([[Corporate social responsibility]] and more.) Also, "In the early 1980s, America's biggest companies dedicated less than half of their profits to shareholders and reinvested the rest in the company. But over the last decade, big American companies have dedicated 93% of earnings to shareholders - redirecting trillions of dollars that could have gone to workers or long-term investments. The result is that booming corporate profits and rising worker productivity have not led to rising wages."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-introduces-accountable-capitalism-act Warren Introduces Accountable Capitalism Act]. warren.senate.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Section 3 of the Act would establish an "Office of United States Corporations", with a director appointed by the President on consent of the Senate, at the [[Department of Commerce]] to grant charters to large federal corporations, and monitor compliance with the Act's requirements. Section 4 requires corporations with over $1 billion in tax receipts to obtain a federal charter.

Section 5(b)(2) requires US corporations to have the purpose of "creating a general public benefit", while section 5(c) requires that directors have a duty to consider the interests of shareholders, employees (including of subsidiaries and suppliers), customers, the community, environment, and the long-term. The section also recasts the limits of the [[business judgment rule]], and its enforcement.

Section 6(a) requires the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] in consultation with the [[National Labor Relations Board]] to issue rules on fair director elections. Section 6(b) requires that no less than 2/5 of the directors shall be elected by employees after one year from the introduction of the rules.

Section 8 requires that any political spending (or "electioneering communication" under the [[Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971]] §304(f)(3)) by a federal corporation over $10,000 has approval of both 75% of shareholders and directors before the spending is made.

==Reception==
The Accountable Capitalism Act was endorsed on August 15, 2018 by a group of 14 academic lawyers and economists, including [[Robert C. Hockett]] and [[William Lazonick]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Federal%20Corporate%20Charter%20Letter%20of%20Support.pdf Letter to Senator Warren from Cornell University Law School, August 15, 2018]. warren.senate.gov&lt;/ref&gt; In media coverage following [[Elizabeth Warren]]'s [[Wall St Journal]] op-ed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Warren |first1=Elizabeth |authorlink=Elizabeth Warren |title=Companies Shouldn’t Be Accountable Only to Shareholders |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=2018-08-14 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-shouldnt-be-accountable-only-to-shareholders-1534287687 |issn=0099-9660 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Bill was described as "a plan to save capitalism"&lt;ref name=vox1&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yglesias |first1=Matthew |authorlink=Matthew Yglesias |title=Elizabeth Warren has a plan to save capitalism |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |date=2018-08-15 |url=https://www.vox.com/2018/8/15/17683022/elizabeth-warren-accountable-capitalism-corporations |accessdate=2018-08-15 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "bold new plan to reshape American capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Durkin, Erin (August 15, 2018), [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/15/elizabeth-warren-accountable-capitalism-act-richest-companies "Elizabeth Warren unveils bold new plan to reshape American capitalism"]. The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to similar proposals in the [[Reward Work Act]] in April 2018, a Civis poll found people in the "lean Democrat" category voted 75% in favor of placing employees on boards of directors, and just 9% opposed. Around 43% of the "lean Republican" category supported the concept, while 31% opposed, and the pure Republican category saw 4% more opposed than in favor.&lt;ref&gt;Anzilotti, Eillie (April 6, 2018), [https://www.fastcompany.com/40555482/want-fairer-workplaces-give-employees-seats-on-the-board "Want Fairer Workplaces?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2993">'''Alguacil''' (in Spanish), '''Aguazil''' or '''Guazil''' (in Portuguese) is a title often to be encountered in stories and plays in [[English language|English]], derived from the Arabic "{{lang|ar|وزير}} (wazir)&lt;ref&gt;http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=alguacil&lt;/ref&gt;", meaning "minister", preceded by the [[Arabic definite article|article "al"]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alguazil|volume=1|page=656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alguacil among the early Spaniards was a judge, and sometimes the governor of a town or fortress, or the [[master at arms]] on a vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Reading material given as coursework by Prof. Bezis-Selfa, Wheaton College, Norton, MA. Reference to insubordinate person locked up by the shipboard ''alguacil'' of [[Hernán Cortés]]&lt;/ref&gt; In later times the office was gradually lowered to the rank of an officer of the court, who is trusted with the service of writs and certain police duties, but he is still of higher rank than the mere ''[[Corchete]]'' or arresting officer. The title has also been given to inspectors of weights and measures in marketplaces, and similar officials.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In modern Spanish usage it can also mean [[Sheriff]] [[Law enforcement officer]], especially in United States.  Also colloquially called Jerife, Cherif, and Sherif.
 
==Types==
There were two types of Aguacils: The ''Aguaciles Mayores'' (Chief Justice) and ''Aguaciles Menores'' (Justice).

The Aguacils of higher importance were the Aguaciles Mayores. These positions were held by the most prominent families, so they approximated the office of ''[[Regidores]]''. (At first they were also in charge of the local prison (jail), but this function was passed very soon to the responsibility of the ''[[Alcaide]]'' or warden.) Their function was to arrest people provided by the ''[[Inquisitor]]'' or investigators and the seizure of their property. To do this one had to be accompanied by the recipient, their family members and the ''Secretary (minister) of Arrests'' (sheriff). He could seek the support of civil authorities. It also ensured the safety of the detainees (defendants), because they had no communications with others except, of course, those authorized by the investigators. Among the junior officers, the Alguacil Mayor held the largest category with the ''Secret Notaries''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gabrielbernat.es/espana/inquisicion/ie/organizacion/alguacilmayor/alguacilmayor.html |title=Alguacil Mayor|language= Spanish|website=GabrielBernat.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The others functions of an Aguacil Mayor were:
* Execute the statements
* Imprison the criminals
* Resolve public order issues
* Appoint wardens of prisons
* Intervene in cases of relevant people

The Aguaciles Menores generally performed the duties on behalf of the Aguacil Mayor.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The '''European Union Divorce Law Pact''' or '''Rome III Regulation''', formally '''Council Regulation (EU) No. 1259/2010 of 20 December 2010 implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of the law applicable to divorce and legal separation''' is a regulation concerning the [[applicable law]] regarding [[divorce law|divorce]] valid in 17 countries. The regulation dictates which law should be used in [[International matrimonial law|cross-border divorces]], while which courts should be used is determined by the [[Brussels II]] Regulation, which is valid for all European Union countries, except Denmark. The agreement, approved by [[Council of the European Union]] on 20 December 2010, took effect in the 14 original contracting parties on 21 June 2012&lt;ref name="INFORCE"/&gt; and makes use of the [[enhanced co-operation]] mechanism which allows a minimum of nine [[Member State of the European Union|EU member states]] to establish advanced [[European integration|integration]] or cooperation in an area within [[Institutions of the European Union|EU structures]] but without all members being involved.&lt;ref name="EUO24"&gt;Vucheva, Elitsa (2008-07-24) [http://euobserver.com/9/26532/?rk=1 Divorce rules could divide EU states], EU Observer&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[European Union]] has been moving towards a common applicable law provisions for divorce law. The [[European Commission]] promulgated the [[Brussels II]] regulation in March 2001 to settle which court of an EU member state was competent to hear cases related to divorce between the members of the European Union. This regulation, amended in 2005, determines which courts will have jurisdiction over what matters.&lt;ref name="Aude Fiorini 2008"&gt;Aude Fiorini. “Rome III—Choice of Law in Divorce: Is the Europeanization of Family Law Going Too Far?” International Journal of Law Policy and the Family 22, (2008), 175-205.&lt;/ref&gt;  But this regulation, which binds all member states save Denmark, does not address which law EU courts should use, and due to the large diversity in divorce laws in the EU, the results may vary strongly depending on which law is used. As one legal scholar noted: “The substantive law pertaining to legal separation continues to differ widely between the Member States: from Maltese law where there is a prohibition of divorce to Finnish of Swedish law where no actual grounds of divorce are required.”&lt;ref name="Aude Fiorini 2008"/&gt;  In addition, the law and legal culture in these countries varies on issues of divorce and marital property. Observers note that the generosity of settlements and alimony differ from state to state.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune.com"&gt;Laurie Goering. “International Divorce a Murky Pit.” The Chicago Tribune. 14 November 2008. http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-europe-divorce_wrapnov14,0,4952502.story.&lt;/ref&gt;  With Brussels II holding that the first valid court to process a filing for divorce is the court that will have jurisdiction, and without a regulation on which law is used, it can matter a great deal where in the EU a ruling is made.&lt;ref name="Aude Fiorini 2008"/&gt;

==Enhanced co-operation==
With the rise in cross border [[divorce]] in the EU, common rules were put forward to settle the issue of where and under which law trans-national couples can divorce in the EU. However [[Sweden]] blocked the new rules,{{cn|date=August 2017}} fearing their impact on the applicability of its liberal divorce law (divorce law differs strongly, with [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] liberalism being in contrast to more conservative countries with more complicated procedures such as [[Malta]] which has only recently permitted it). In order to allow those willing states to proceed without Sweden, in July 2008 nine countries put forward a proposal to use [[enhanced cooperation]]: [[Austria]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Romania]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Spain]]. [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Portugal]] were considering joining them.&lt;ref name="two speed"/&gt;

At a meeting of the justice ministers on 25 July 2008, the nine states decided to formally seek the measure of enhanced cooperation; eight states (the nine states above minus France) formally requested it from the European Commission on 28 July 2008.&lt;ref name="two speed"&gt;[http://euobserver.com/9/26546/?rk=1 Two-speed Europe may emerge over divorce rules], EUobserver&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/221945,eu-members-look-to-marry-up-their-divorce-laws.html EU members look to marry up their divorce laws], Europe World]&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 March 2010, when the law was formally proposed by the commission, [[Bulgaria]] was the tenth state to join the aforementioned eight and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8585186.stm | work=BBC News | title=EU moves to clarify divorce laws | date=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belgium]], [[Germany]] and [[Latvia]] formally joined them on 28 May 2010, while [[Greece]] withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/justice-divorce.4xi/ |title=Three more EU Member States back cross-border divorce law pact — EUbusiness - legal, business and economic news from Europe and the EU |publisher=Eubusiness.com |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2011-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEP back"/&gt;

==Content==
The [[applicable law]] is determined based on a number of criteria. If a higher ranked criterion is not applicable the evaluation moves one lower. The main criteria for the choice of law are&lt;ref name="INFORCE"/&gt;
# The choice of the couple (choosing from the law of one of their nationalities or their (previous) place of residence, or the law of the court seized
# The place of their residence
# Their last place of residence (maximum 1 year ago, 1 of the spouses should still live there)
# Their nationality
# The law of the court seized ([[lex fori]])
In case a separation is not possible within the determined law according to the scheme (for example in case of divorce of a same sex couple), the law of the court seized applies. The regulation is also applicable to [[legal separation]] and conversion of [[legal separation]] to divorce.

'''Corroborating evidence''' (or '''corroboration''') is evidence that supports a proposition already supported by initial evidence, therefore confirming the original proposition. For example, W, a witness, testifies that she saw X drive his automobile into a green car.  Meanwhile, Y, another witness, testifies that when he examined X's car, later that day, he noticed green paint on its fender. There can also be corroborating evidence related to a certain source, such as what makes an author think a certain way due to the evidence that was supplied by witnesses or objects.&lt;ref&gt;For more information on this type of reasoning, see: [[Casuistry]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of corroborating evidence comes from using the [[Baconian method]], i.e. the  [[method of agreement]], [[Mill's Methods#Method of difference|method of difference]], and [[method of concomitant variations]].

These methods are followed in [[experimental design]]. They were codified by [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]], and developed further by [[John Stuart Mill]] and consist of controlling several [[Dependent and independent variables|variables]], in turn, to establish which variables are [[causality|causally]] connected. These principles are widely used intuitively in various kinds of proofs, demonstrations and investigations, in addition to being fundamental to experimental design.

In law, corroboration refers to the requirement in some jurisdictions, such as in [[Scots Law|Scotland]], that any evidence adduced be backed up by at least one other source (see [[Corroboration in Scots law]]).

==Corroboration broken down==
If one person says, “this is what I intended by the action I took,” and his friend agrees that his actions could have looked like what their friend intended. Then it can be generally agreed that is what happened.

If one person says, “this is what I meant by what I said,” and his friend agrees that was their understanding of what was meant by their friend. Then it can be generally agreed that is what was meant.

==An example of corroboration==
Defendant says "It was like what he/she (a witness) said and...". This is corroborative evidence from the defendant that the evidence the witness gave is true and correct.

Corroboration is not needed in certain instances. For example, there are certain statutory exceptions. In the [[Education (Scotland) Act]], it is only necessary to produce a register as proof of lack of attendance. No further evidence is needed.

==England and Wales==
'''Perjury'''

See section 13 of the [[Perjury Act 1911]].

'''Speeding offences'''

See section 89(2) of the [[Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984]].

'''Sexual offences'''

See section 32 of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]].

'''Confessions by mentally handicapped persons'''

See section 77 of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]].

'''Evidence of children'''

See section 34 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]].

'''Evidence of accomplices'''

See section 32 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.

[[File:Old Bailey Microcosm edited.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|A trial at the [[Old Bailey]] in [[London]] as drawn by Thomas Rowlandson and Augustus Pugin for Ackermann's Microcosm of London (1808–11).]]
A '''court''' is a [[tribunal]], often as a [[government]] [[institution]], with the [[authority]] to [[Adjudication|adjudicate]] [[legal dispute]]s between [[Party (law)|parties]] and carry out the [[administration of justice]] in [[Private law|civil]], [[Criminal law|criminal]], and [[Administrative law|administrative]] matters in accordance with the [[rule of law]].&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=David |title=The Oxford Companion to Law |place=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1980 |page=301 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4GgYAAAAIAAJ |isbn=0-19-866110-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; In both [[common law]] and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[legal system]]s, courts are the central means for [[dispute resolution]], and it is generally understood that all people have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the [[Rights of the accused|rights of those accused]] of a crime include the right to present a [[Criminal defense|defense]] before a court.

The system of courts that interprets and applies the [[law]] is collectively known as the [[judiciary]]. The place where a court sits is known as a [[Venue (law)|venue]]. The room where court proceedings occur is known as a [[courtroom]], and the building as a [[courthouse]]; court facilities range from simple and very small facilities in rural communities to large buildings in cities.

The practical authority given to the court is known as its [[jurisdiction]] ({{lang-la|jus dicere'|links=no}}) – the court's power to decide certain kinds of questions or petitions put to it. According to [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]],'' a court is constituted by a minimum of three parties: the ''actor'' or [[plaintiff]], who complains of an injury done; the ''reus'' or [[defendant]], who is called upon to make satisfaction for it, and the ''judex'' or judicial power, which is to examine the truth of the fact, to determine the law arising upon that fact, and, if any injury appears to have been done, to ascertain and by its [[Officer of the court|officers]] to apply a [[legal remedy]]. It is also usual in the superior courts to have barristers, and attorneys or counsel, as assistants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk3ch3.asp|title=Avalon Project - Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England - Book the Third - Chapter the Third : Of Courts in General|website=Avalon.law.yale.edu|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though, often, courts consist of additional barristers, [[bailiff]]s, [[reporter (law)|reporters]], and perhaps a jury.

The term "the court" is also used to refer to the [[Chairman|presiding officer]] or officials, usually one or more [[judge]]s. The judge or panel of judges may also be collectively referred to as "the [[Bench (law)|bench]]" (in contrast to [[Attorney at law|attorneys]] and [[barrister]]s, collectively referred to as "the [[Bar (law)|bar]]"). In the [[United States]], and other common law jurisdictions, the term "court" (in the case of U.S. federal courts) by law is used to describe the judge himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{usc|28|1}}: "The Supreme Court of the United States ''shall consist'' of a ''Chief Justice'' of the United States and ''eight associate justices'' [ . . . ]" (italics added); {{uscsub|28|43|b}}: "Each court of appeals ''shall consist'' of the ''circuit judges'' of the circuit in regular active service." (italics added); {{uscsub|28|132|b}} (in part): "Each district court ''shall consist'' of the ''district judge or judges'' for the district in regular active service." (italics added); {{usc|28|151}} (in part): "In each judicial district, the ''bankruptcy judges'' in regular active service ''shall constitute a unit of the district court'' to be known as the bankruptcy court for that district [ . . . ]" (italics added).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the legal authority of a court to take action is based on [[personal jurisdiction]] over the parties to the litigation and [[subject-matter jurisdiction]] over the claims asserted.

==Etymology==
The word ''court'' comes from the French ''cour'', an enclosed yard, which derives from the Latin form ''cortem'', the accusative case of ''cohors'', which again means an enclosed yard or the occupants of such a yard. The English word ''court'' is a cognate of the Latin word ''hortus'' from Ancient Greek χόρτος (khórtos) (meaning "garden", hence horticulture and orchard), both referring to an enclosed space.&lt;ref name=OEtD&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=court (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=court|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of a judicial assembly is first attested in the 12th century, and derives from the earlier usage to designate a sovereign and his entourage, which  met to adjudicate disputes in such an enclosed yard. The verb "to court", meaning to win favor, derives from the same source since people traveled to the sovereign's court to win his favor.&lt;ref name=OEtD /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/cour|title=COUR : Etymologie de COUR|website=Cnrtl.fr|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisdiction==
{{Main|Jurisdiction}}
The word ''jurisdiction'' comes from ''juris'' and ''dictio'' (a speaking and pronouncing of the law).&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:The Federalist Papers/No. 81|The Federalist No. 81]], footnote 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Jurisdiction is defined as the official authority to make legal decisions and judgements over an individual or materialistic item within a territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://civilprocedure.uslegal.com/jurisdiction/|title=Jurisdiction – Civil Procedure|first=US Legal,|last=Inc.|website=Civilprocedure.uslegal.com|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Whether a given court has jurisdiction to preside over a given case" is a key question in any legal action.&lt;ref name="WexJurisdiction"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/jurisdiction Jurisdiction], [[Legal Information Institute]], Cornell Law School.&lt;/ref&gt; Three basic components of jurisdiction are [[personal jurisdiction]] over an individual, jurisdiction over the particular subject matter ([[subject-matter jurisdiction]]) or thing (''res'') and territorial jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="WexJurisdiction"/&gt; Jurisdiction over a person refers to the full authority over a person regardless on where they live, jurisdiction over a particular subject matter  refers to the authority over the said subject of legal cases involved in a case, and lastly, territorial jurisdiction is the authority over a person within an x amount of space.

Other concepts of jurisdiction include [[general jurisdiction]], [[exclusive jurisdiction]], [[territorial jurisdiction]], [[appellate jurisdiction]], and (in the [[United States federal courts]]) [[diversity jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name="WexJurisdiction"/&gt;

==Trial and appellate courts==
[[Trial court]]s are courts that hold [[trial]]s. Sometimes termed "courts of first instance", trial courts have varying [[original jurisdiction]]. Trial courts may conduct trials with juries as the [[Trier of fact|finders of fact]] (these are known as [[jury trial]]s) or trials in which judges act as both finders of fact and [[Question of law|finders of law]] (in some jurisdictions these are known as [[bench trial]]s). Juries are less common in court systems outside the [[Anglosphere|Anglo-American]] common law tradition.

[[Appellate court]]s are courts that hear [[appeal]]s of lower courts and trial courts.

Some courts, such as the [[Crown Court]] in England and Wales may have both trial and appellate jurisdictions.

==Civil law courts and common law courts==
The two major legal traditions of the western world are the civil law courts and the common law courts. These two great legal traditions are similar, in that they are products of western culture although there are significant differences between the two traditions. Civil law courts are profoundly based upon Roman Law, specifically a civil body of law entitled "[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Corpus iuris civilis]]".&lt;ref name=LUS&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Mehren|first1=Arthur T.|last2=Murray|first2=Peter L.|title=Law in the United States|date=8 Jan 2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139462198|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9tpJlKdqVTsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory of civil law was rediscovered around the end of the eleventh century and became a foundation for university legal education starting in Bologna, Spain and subsequently being taught throughout continental European Universities.&lt;ref name="LUS"/&gt; Civil law is firmly ensconced in the French and German legal systems. Common law courts were established by English royal judges of the King's Council after the Norman Invasion of Britain in 1066.&lt;ref name=BurnLUS&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burnham,|first1=William|title=Introduction to the Law and Legal System of the United States|date=2006|publisher=Thomson-West|location=St. Paul (Minn.)|isbn=9780314158987|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The royal judges created a body of law by combining local customs they were made aware of through traveling and visiting local jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="BurnLUS"/&gt; This common standard of law became known as "Common Law". This legal tradition is practiced in the English and American legal systems. In most civil law jurisdictions, courts function under an [[inquisitorial system]]. In the common law system, most courts follow the [[adversarial system]]. [[Procedural law]] governs the rules by which courts operate: [[civil procedure]] for private disputes (for example); and [[criminal procedure]] for violation of the criminal law. In recent years international courts are being created to resolve matters not covered by the jurisdiction of national courts.  For example, The International Criminal Court, based in The Hague, in The Kingdom of The Netherlands.

==Court television shows==
Television show courts, which are not part of the judicial system and are generally [[arbitration|private arbitrators]], are depicted within the [[court show]] genre; however, the courts depicted have been criticized as misrepresenting real-life courts of law and the true nature of the legal system.&lt;ref name="GoogleBooksCourtroom"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7fOVPmlS4MC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=judge+judy+courtroom&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OC-wUMHTNeTW2gXVo4CgDA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=judge%20judy%20courtroom&amp;f=false |title=Judicial Process: Law, Courts, and Politics in the United States - David W.

In [[halakhah|Jewish law]], '''damages''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''nezikin'' נזיקין) covers a range of jurisprudential topics that roughly correspond in [[secular]] [[law]] to [[torts]]. Jewish law on damages is grounded partly on the Written Torah, the [[Hebrew Bible]], and partly on the [[Oral Torah]], centered primarily in the [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] Order of ''[[Nezikin]]''. Since at least of the time of the [[Mishnah]], Rabbinic culture developed and interpreted the laws of damages through communal courts, judges, and enforcement. While Jewish communities exercised relatively little authority over [[criminal law]] in the [[diaspora]], quasi-autonomous communal oversight of damages (tort law) continued to be extensive until the modern era. Today, observant Jews may voluntarily submit themselves to adjudication of damages disputes by rabbinic judges and courts (beit din). In addition, aspects of rabbinic law have been absorbed into tort law in [[Israel]].

Torts or "damages" include any wrongful act, neglect, or default whereby legal harm is caused to the person, property, or reputation of another. Damages usually give rise to some form of compensatory liability, though some exceptional damages may be prohibited (or merely deprecated) without concomitant liability. Under rabbinic law, there are important distinctions between damages caused by persons or by property, and between direct and indirect action. When people cause damage directly, they are covered by the rabbinic equivalent of either [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]], against another person, or [[trespass]] against another's property. When one's property causes damage, Jewish law may distinguish torts due to such factors as [[accident]]s, [[negligence]], [[fault (legal)|fault]] or wilful [[fraud]].

As a [[religious law]], Jewish law or [[halakhah]] characterize a variety of actions as damages, though these may not correspond to secular legal conceptions. Notably, Jewish law tends to go beyond secular law in prohibiting or regulating acts of hurtful speech, humiliation, betrayal, and self-injury.

== History and Literature ==
In rabbinic literature, '''damages''' law is articulated primarily in tractate  [[Bava Kamma]] of the aptly named Order Nezikin. In Bava Kamma, the Mishnah and [[Talmud]] set forth the framework for damages law and formulate numerous rules and key principles. In addition, law pertaining to damages appears in [[Bava Metzia]], [[Sanhedrin]] and other Talmudic tractates. After undergoing further expression during the [[Geonic period]], damages law was incorporated in the [[Halakhah|Jewish law codes]] of the medieval and early modern periods. In the [[Shulchan Aruch]] (16th century), the topic is codified primarily within [[Hoshen Mishpat]], the section (''Tur'') most similar to modern [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. The law of damages remained a popular and important topic throughout the history of rabbinic [[responsa]] literature, tapering off dramatically in the 19th century as European Jewish communities come under the jurisdiction of national legal systems.&lt;ref&gt;Elon&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accidents&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;  ==
In daily life, an accident is an unforeseen harm that befalls a person or property, usually through lack of care. The person injured or the owner of the things destroyed or depreciated is entitled to compensation and if necessary to seek redress in a civil court through litigation, which, in every system of jurisprudence, is governed by special laws.

=== The Four "Father Categories" of Damage ===
The Torah deals with the law of negligence in {{bibleverse||Ex|21:28-36|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Ex|22:4-5|HE}}, the leading cases being those of an ox goring a man or beast; an open, unprotected pit; fire spreading to a neighbor's property; also, to a certain extent, trespassing cattle. For the rules of {{bibleverse||Ex|22:6-14|HE}}, concerning the liability of a person lawfully possessed of another's goods for loss or destruction, see Bailments. In the language of the Mishnah the chief instances given in the Torah for a more broadly applicable law, such as those relating to the Goring Ox or those relating to any animal that inflicts unusual harm, or to the open pit or any similar inanimate thing, are called "fathers"; other instances derived from these are known as "descendants". The latter may be called "derivatives."

The ''Mishnah'' and the ''[[Tosefta]]'' treat the law of compensation for results of negligence in [[Bava Kamma]], i.-vi., commented on in the Babylonian Talmud, 2-62b, and in the Jerusalem Talmud, 2-5c. Maimonides, in his "Yad ha-Ḥazaḳah," treats the subject under the heading Damage to Property ("''Nizḳe Mamon''").

The "goring ox" with its derivatives is put aside, because full compensation for its acts can be demanded only when the master has been forewarned, and the treatise opens with the following four "fathers" for full compensation, under the technical names of "ox," "pit," "chewer," and "kindling." Here the "ox" means an animal allowed to trespass on a stranger's land and do injury with its foot; the "chewer," a like animal that does harm with its teeth. Both examples are derived from {{bibleverse||Ex|22:4|HE}}. The damage done may far surpass the gain to the owner of the animal. The "pit" refers to {{bibleverse||Ex|21:33|HE}}, the "kindling" to {{bibleverse||Ex|22:5|HE}}. It may be remarked that [[Abba Arika]], the eminent Babylonian authority, understands the "ox" among the "fathers" to embrace both the foot and tooth, and regards the word here rendered "chewer" as standing for man; for when a man himself commits an injury he is always mulcted in full damages (B. Ḳ. 3b).

=== Derivative Categories ===
Any tame animal permitted wilfully or carelessly to go on a neighbor's land, and which does mischief by knocking things over with its body, or by dragging them along by means of its hair, tail, harness, bridle, or yoke, or by the burden which it carries, or by rubbing against a post or wall, is a derivative of the "ox," while an animal breaking down a post or wall by rubbing against it, or defiling grain or grass with its excrements, is a derivative of the "chewer." But striking with the body, or malignantly biting, or crouching on something, or kicking, is treated on the same principle as "goring." Chickens, dogs, cats, and even hogs are named among the animals for which the owner is made liable. Derivatives of the "pit" are a stone, knife, burden, or a mound; in short, anything over which one can stumble or from which one can receive injury if left in (public domain); that is, on the highway or on common lands. Derivatives of the "kindling" are articles which the owner has left on his roof, whence the wind carries them off to the injury of person or property. For whatever damage arises indirectly, the ultimate author is liable to the extent of only half compensation. Thus, when the foot, in striking the ground, kicks up pebbles, and these cause an injury, or when the animal upsets any implements, which in turn fall upon other implements and break them, the damage is considered remote, and only half compensation is given. These remote damages, when caused by animals, are known generally as the "case of pebbles."

== Assault and Battery &lt;ref&gt;Text from the ''Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;==
"[[Assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]]" is the English law term for injury to the person (Hebrew: "khovel be-khavero"). In ancient law, redress for injuries to the body takes the form of compensation to the person wronged, not of punishment in the name of the state; and this principle is found throughout the Talmudic jurisprudence. Many nations of antiquity and the Germanic tribes as late as the earlier Middle Ages allowed even the guilt of the slayer to be atoned by the payment of "wergild"—that is, man-money—to the heirs of the slain; but here Jewish law calls a halt with its stern command, "Ye shall take no ransom for the life of a manslayer" (Num. xxxv. 31, R. V.).

=== The Law of Retaliation ===
The passages of Scripture from which the law of assault and battery is derived are Ex. xxi. 18, 19 and 22-25; Lev. xxiv. 19, 20; Deut. xix. 21 (indirectly), and xxv. 11, 12. According to the literal interpretation, these passages teach the law of retaliation: eye for eye, tooth for tooth, as the redress for mutilation or, technically speaking, mayhem; bruise for bruise, stripe for stripe, etc., as the redress for the infliction of pain; and cutting off the offender's hand as the punishment for disgracing another by violent means. It seems that the Sadducees, when in power, conformably to their love for the letter of the law in all matters, followed these passages literally. At least the Megillat Ta'anit (ch. iv.) ascribes this practise to the "Boethus men," with whom the Sadducees are often identified; and the varied efforts of many sages to give good Scriptural grounds for their own theory (B. Ḳ. 83b) indicate that there were some who dissented from the Pharisaic interpretation. The liability for bodily violence is stated in the Mishnah (B. Ḳ. viii. 1) as follows:

=== Five Grounds of Liability ===
In cases of injury to a person, Talmudic law identifies five categories of [[damages]]:
# damage proper (''nezek'');
# pain; (''tza'ar'')
# stoppage of work; (''shevet'')
# cost of cure; (''ripui'') and
# shame (''boshet'')

In dealing with these categories, the [[Gemara]] (BḲ 83b et seq.) first discusses why the literal rule of [[Eye for an eye|eye for eye]] must yield to the more humane law of [[compensatory damages]] in money. Referring to the passage in Lev. 24:17 et seq., where the smiting of a man is treated along with the smiting of an animal, it is argued that, as payment is made for the latter, so payment should be made for the former, except in the special case in which the man is killed, inasmuch as the Lawgiver says (Num. xxxv. 31), "Ye shall take no ransom for the life of a manslayer"; which shows that for the murderer there is no ransom or satisfaction, but that there is a ransom for him that takes anything less than life, as, for instance, the principal limbs, which, when removed, never grow again. Again, if a blind man put out the eyes of a man possessing sight, what can be done to the offender in the way of retaliation? Nevertheless, the Law says, "Ye shall have one manner of law" (Lev. xxiv. 22); hence redress must be adjudged in money against all alike. Further, stress is laid on the term "taḦat" (for, in place of) which is applied to animals, as, "he shall surely pay ox for ox" (Ex. xxi. 36), and again in the phrase "eye for [in place of] eye" (ib. 24); still greater stress is laid on the verb "natan" (to give), which is used in Ex. xxi. 22, where nothing but a money reward can be meant, and is again used in the rule in Lev. xxiv. 20, which literally translated reads, "as he giveth a blemish upon man, so shall it be given upon him."

Since the interpretation of "eye for eye" is established as monetary compensation, there is no reason for them to doubt that "bruise for bruise" means money for the pain suffered, and does not mean the infliction of like pain. However, the position is strengthened by the passage in Deut. xxii. 28, 29, where he who forcibly seizes a damsel not betrothed and lies with her, is mulcted in the sum of fifty shekels, because (taḦat asher) "he hath humbled her."

The separate elements of liability are:

==== Damage Proper (Nezek) and its Appraisal ====
How much should a person be compensated for injuries? The Mishnah says the damage is appraised by calculating the different of two values: how much the person injured would have been worth as a [[slave]] in the market before the infliction of the injury and how much the injured party is worth after it. This difference represents the liability for damage proper (nezek). But if the result of the injury has been to render its victim deaf, he is considered worth nothing whatsoever, and the damage is accordingly equal to the whole of his former value.

==== Pain ====
Pain, "as when he has singed him with a spit or spike, even on his finger-nail, where no mark is left." Here the question arises, should the judges ask themselves (a) how much money would "such a man"—that is, one as strong or as delicate as the injured man—be willing to take to submit to the pain, or rather (b) how much would he be willing to pay to forego the pain? The former measure, though named in the Mishnah, is in the Gemara deemed inadmissible; for many people would not take all the money in the world and willingly submit to the pain: the latter measure is held to be more reasonable. Where the pain is incident to a mutilation, the judges should say: "Suppose the wounded man to have been sentenced to have his hand cut off, how much would he be willing to pay to have it taken off under the influence of a drug [an anesthetic], rather than have it rudely hacked off; and this amount would serve to represent the damage" (B. Ḳ. 85a).

==== Stoppage of Work ====
The Mishnah allows to the injured man his wages only as a "watcher of cucumbers"—that is, such wages as he can earn in his disabled condition—"because he has already been paid the value of his eye or the value of his hand"; for the action might be brought at once when the injury was done, and the judges would estimate the loss of time beforehand. This estimate should be paid in full, though the injured man should recover sooner than was expected (B. Ḳ. 85b).

An example is put, where violence may bring about stoppage of work alone, without mutilation or pain or need for cure: it is in the case of unlawful imprisonment (ib.).

The Gemara specifies that where the injury is temporary and expected to heal completely, the injured man is paid the wages he earned at his profession. These are not included in the payment for "damage" as they are when the injury is permanent.  (B. K. 86a).

==== Cost of Cure ====
Talmudic law provided for a kind of health cost coverage, a liability imposed on whomever causes injury.

As the Scripture says, he "shall cause him to be thoroughly healed" (Ex. xxi. 19), the inference is that the guilty party shall pay for the services of a physician. He may not offer his own services, no matter what his skill may be; nor can he avoid the outlay of money by finding a physician that will do the healing work free of charge. Should ulcers arise in consequence of a wound, the cost of healing such ulcers also falls on the assailant; but if ulcers arise from other causes—for instance, because the wounded man disregards the orders of his physician—the cost of healing these is not to be assessed. The wound may disappear and break out again and again: the cost of cure will still rest on the assailant; but if it be once fully healed (literally, "to its full need"), the liability comes to an end (B. Ḳ. viii. 1). The occasion for cost of cure may exist without any of the other elements of damage; for instance, where one has forcibly thrown chemicals upon another, giving to his skin the whiteness of leprosy, it is his duty to pay the cost of having the skin restored to a healthy color (B. Ḳ. 85b).

==== Shame or Humiliation ====
For the sages, it was deemed of utmost importance to avoid shaming another person. Hence, they sought to impose liability for humiliating personal injury, regardless of the physical effects of the injury.

Here it is impossible to lay down hard and fast rules; for, as the Mishnah says, "it all depends on who is put to shame and who it is that puts him to shame." But for certain acts of violence that involve very little pain and no permanent disablement, but mainly disgrace, the sages fixed a scale of compensation, namely: for a stroke with the fist, one sela or shekel (nominally 60 cents); for a slap with the open hand, two hundred zuzin (1 zuz = 15 cents); for a back-handed slap, or for pulling a man's ear or hair, or tearing off his cloak or a woman's headgear, or spitting at a person if the spittle reaches his flesh, four hundred zuzin ($60 nominal) (B. Ḳ. viii. 6). A kick with the knee costs three selas; with the foot five selas; a stroke with an ass' saddle thirteen (B. Ḳ. 27b, Rashi l.c.). According to Maimonides (Yad ha-Ḥazaḳah, Ḥobel u-Mazziḳ, iii. 8-10), each slap, kick, or stroke counts separately. But he also says (following B. Ḳ. 36b) that these sums are not meant for the full-weight or Tyrian coins, but for the "country currency," worth only one-eighth of the Tyrian.

These liquidated damages cover only pain and shame: if sickness ensue, stoppage and cure have to be paid for separately.

=== Israelites to Be Treated as Free Persons ===
Although R. Meïr's opinion (B. Ḳ. 86a), that all Israelites are to be treated as freemen and as freewomen, as "the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," and are therefore entitled to the same compensation for disgrace, has not been accepted generally, yet where the sum has been fixed by the sages, as shown above, no reduction is made on account of the poverty or low degree or even of the lack of self-respect of the party insulted.

There is a sixth element (which arises, however, but rarely); namely, the "price of children" (Ex. xxi. 22): "If men strive together and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no mischief follow, . . . he shall pay as the judges determine." Something is to be paid over and above damage, pain, etc., which is hard to determine; for a woman delivered of her child is, generally speaking, not made the worse thereby; though in the special case she may be much debilitated. Her loss of health and strength would fall under the head of damage proper ("nezeḳ").

Another view is, however, expressed in the Mishnah to the effect that the "deme weladot," the price of the child or children that were destroyed by the miscarriage, should be paid to the husband of the woman by the man causing the damage. The standard authorities are almost silent on the subject (B. Ḳ. v. 4; Gemara, 49a).

=== Human Beings Are "Forewarned" ===
A human being is always "forewarned"; that is, he is, like a "forewarned ox," liable for full damage, whether awake or asleep, whether willing or unwilling. But if a man in his sleep or unwillingly (as by falling from a roof) hurt another person, he is not liable for the "disgrace" that might result, say, if such person's clothes should be torn from him; and if A hurt B by pure accident—for instance, if he be thrown upon him from a roof by a sudden gust of wind—he is liable only for damage, but not for pain, healing, or stoppage (B. Ḳ. viii. 1; Gemara 86b).

Deaf-mutes, insane persons, and infants are "pegi'atan ra'ah" (bad to meet); he who hurts them is liable for full compensation; but if they commit an assault, they are not liable at all (ib. viii. 4). However, no compensation for shame is made to the insane (ib. 86b). When an injury is done to an infant girl, the compensation for "damage" and loss of time is payable to her father (ib. 87a et seq.).

=== Persons "Bad to Meet" ===
A married woman or a slave is also "bad to meet," as full compensation must be paid for any injury done to either of them. According to the better opinion, the assailant of a slave must pay even for the disgrace put upon him. The compensation for injury to a married woman, for pain and shame, is paid to her; for loss of work and healing, to her husband; for damage proper, according to one opinion, to her, according to another, to her husband. For an injury to a slave the whole compensation goes to the master. When an injury is done to an infant boy still at the father's board, the compensation should be invested in land, of which the father will receive the rents and profits till the boy attains full age (thirteen). When a father injures his infant daughter, he pays pain, cure, and shame to her at once, but neither damage nor loss of time. A married woman is excused from payment only because she has no property under her own control; a slave, because he can not own property: hence, when the woman, by the death of her husband or by divorce, comes to her own, or when the slave is manumitted, she or he may be sued for the injury done while under disability (ib. viii. 4).

When a man does an injury to his own wife, he is bound to pay her for her damage, pain, and shame at once, in such a manner as to give her the free disposition of the money. He needs not pay for loss of work; and for her healing he is bound as her husband. The wife, if she injure her husband, is liable for full compensation (Maimonides, "Yad," Ḥobel u-Mazziḳ, iv. 16-18). For the manner of its collection see Ketubah.

A master is not responsible for assaults committed by his bondman or bondwoman, nor for injuries done by them to the property of another. A master injuring a Hebrew servant is liable for all the elementsof damage except that of stoppage of work, that being a loss to him only (B. Ḳ. viii. 3).

=== Self-Defense a Justification ===
Self-defense is a full justification for an assault that is not continued after the necessity has ceased. But if two men strike each other at the same time, each is liable to the other, and the excess in damages must be paid (ShulḦan 'Aruk, Ḥoshen Mishpaṭ, 421, 13).

Where one enters upon the grounds of another without his permission, the owner of the ground may order him off, and may even remove him by force; but if he strike him or harm him otherwise than in forcing him away, he is liable like any other assailant (B. Ḳ. 48a).

Should the injured party die before he recovers judgment for the assault, the right of action is cast upon his heirs; and in like manner if the assailant die before satisfaction is made or before it is adjudged, the action for the wrong done may be brought against the heirs, and it may be satisfied out of the estate descended to such heirs.

To this rule there is one very rare exception; namely, where one puts a disgrace upon a sleeping person (say, by exposing his nakedness), and the sleeper dies without finding it out, the action for the disgrace does not pass to his heirs (B. Ḳ. 86b).

The maxim of the common law, that a felony merges the civil remedy, was also known to the Rabbis. When a man strikes his father or mother so as to leave a mark ("Ḧabburah"), or when he wounds any one on the Sabbath, he can not be sued for compensation; for he is deserving of death. While it was very unlikely that the offender would be put to death—for long before the days of the Mishnah capital punishment under the Mosaic law had ceased —still this excuse of the lesser offense by the greater was held good. But where the act is punishable by stripes only, such as wounding a person on the Day of Atonement, the civil remedy is available (B. Ḳ. viii. 3, 5).

The payments for damage and for pain are in the nature of penalties, and can be adjudged only upon proof by witnesses. But in the absence of witnesses the assailant can, upon his own confession, be ordered to pay for loss of work and cost of cure—which elements are in the nature of a debt—and for the disgrace suffered, on the ground that by his own confession he publishes the humiliation of his victim (Maimonides, "Yad," Ḥobel u-Mazziḳ, v. 6, 7).

=== Procedure in Assault Cases ===
Only a court of "ordained" judges could try an action for injury to the person, according to the rules laid down above, and give judgment for a definite sum; and as judges could not be lawfully ordained, except in the Holy Land, judgments for damage and pain could not be collected, even in Babylonia (B. Ḳ. 84a). But, as a matter of necessity, a system was worked out which soon spread over all countries in which the Jews enjoyed any sort of autonomy. When parties complained of injuries, the judges, after hearing their allegations and the testimony of witnesses, indicated the sum that in their opinion the assailant should pay, and, upon his refusal, would threaten him with excommunication ("nidduy"); and this course would generally have the desired effect. But loss of time and cost of cure, being elements sounding in money, and not in the nature of penalties, can only be determined by judges having ordination (Maimonides, "Yad," Sanh. v. 10, 17).

Although the remedy for assaults was altogether pecuniary, yet to strike a fellow-Israelite was always deemed a sinful and forbidden action. As the Law strictly forbids the giving to a convicted criminal a single blow beyond the lawful number (Deut. xxv. 3), the sages concluded that a blow given to any one, except by authority of law, was forbidden by Scripture; and they held that, though the assailant had paid all damages, he should ask forgiveness from the injured party, and that it was the duty of the injured, when earnestly entreated, not vindictively to withhold his forgiveness (B. Ḳ. viii. 7).

When damages which usually follow a striking arise without actual contact with the body of the injured person—for instance, if one frighten his neighbor, or yell into his ears in such a way as to deafen him or otherwise make him ill—the wrong-doer is "free from human judgment," but liable to the punishment of heaven (B. Ḳ. 91a).

=== Gentiles and Women ===
Due to the [[midrash]]ic interpretation of Biblical law, laws of assault and battery were not applied to affairs in which either party was a [[gentile]]. Specifically, the [[Torah]] regulates interactions between persons and their fellow, the latter understood as a fellow Jew. Whatever redress was given in cases with gentiles by Jewish courts was only a matter of [[Justice|equity]], or, as the Rabbis say, by reference to Prov. iii. 17, "for the sake of the ways of peace" (''darchei shalom'').

The law of damages does cover women, both as plaintiff and defendant. (mB.K., ch.1)&lt;ref&gt;Bibliographic note: Nearly all of the Talmudic law collected here on assault and battery is to be found in the eighth chapter of Baba Kamma (83b to 93a). The subject is treated by [[Maimonides]] in [[Mishneh Torah|Yad ha-Hazakah]], Hovel u-Mazzik, in the [[Arba'ah Turim|Tur]], and in the Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat, under the title Chovel ba-chavero (ch. 420-424).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-Injury and Self-Endangerment ==
Owing largely to Jewish [[theology|religious principles]], [[halakhah]] forbids both injury to others as well as injury to one's self.

Why is self-injury prohibited? In rabbinic Judaism, human beings are not given unfettered autonomy over their bodies and actions; instead, God is considered the creator and owner, while each human serves as a [[stewardship|steward]] for their life. In addition, rabbinic Judaism places the utmost value on human life, including preservation of the living human body, and this value is applied to responsibility to one's self. By the same token, Jewish law forbids [[suicide]] and, generally speaking, [[self-mutilation]]. Furthermore, just as halakhah sets limits on how much one may place another person, or their property, in danger, so does the law restrict self-endangerment.

Principles of self-injury are applied to more than just one's self. It is noteworthy that a person may not request or hire an [[Agent (law)|agent]] to injure themselves: it is forbidden to waive the rule against self-injury or to abet self-injury to one's own body.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, [[Mishneh Torah]], ''Hilchot Khovel u-Mazik'' ch.5, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mishnah states: "If a person asks, 'Blind my eye', or 'cut off my hand' or 'break my leg,' anyone who does so is liable (for violating injury law) -- even if a person asking to be injured stipulates that anyone who does so would be exempt, the one who causes injury would still be liable. Likewise, if a person asks, 'Tear my clothes' or break my pitcher' then anyone who does so is liable; however, if a person asking for their property to be damages stipulates that anyone who does so would be exempt, then the exemption is valid." (''[[Bava Kamma]]'' 8:7)

Given the Jewish disregard for self-injury, rabbinic law also seeks to reduce the extent to which people put themselves into situations of potential danger. However, self-endangerment is difficult to regulate when the chances of harm are either very low, hard to assess, or commonly accepted. In the medieval period, rabbinic authorities differed on whether to restrict activities, such as [[bloodletting]] or [[circumcision]], at inauspicious (or [[superstitious]]) times. Rabbis eventually overturned such questionable self-endangerment precedents, as when they allowed marriage to a woman who had more than one previous husband die ([[isha katlanit]]). In the 20th century, Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] and other [[poskim]] examined whether [[Jewish law and history on smoking|Jewish law forbids cigarette smoking]] or whether smoking risks are so commonplace as to be permitted under the principle that "[[The Lord protects the simple]]".

Nonetheless, the laws of self-injury are complex because halakhah allows people to harm or endanger themselves in certain circumstances. In Jewish law, several quite different values may be called upon to justify self-injury. Notably, in some cases, people are allowed or even required to endanger themselves in order to save life. As stated in [[Leviticus]] 19:16, "Do not stand idly by" when one's fellow is in harm's way. Similarly, [[Jewish medical ethics]] expects patients to make an effort to receive adequate medical care, albeit with pain and risk. Furthermore, halakhah recognizes that there is [[no free lunch]] -- people must expose themselves to [[occupational health|occupational hazards]] in order to make a livelihood (''parnassah''). For example, the Bible mentions hazardous work&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Igrot Moshe on working in trees&lt;/ref&gt; and Talmudic literature sanctions jobs that require perilous sea crossings or caravan journeys. In the modern era, Rabbi [[Ezekiel Landau]] is cited for his limited approval of wild animal [[hunting]] for livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;Noda bi-Yehudah n.10&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, as in [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], Judaism makes exceptions for [[self-injury]] in cases of theological or communal crisis, even to the point of [[martyrdom]].

== Miscellaneous Torts and Damages&lt;ref&gt;Text from the ''Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; ==
=== Mesne Profits: In the Mishnah and Talmud ===
The income derived from land unlawfully held by the possessor, for which he is answerable to the true owner when the latter recovers the land from him by the judgment of a court. The Talmud speaks of the possessor of land without right as the "robber of the land" (in English law, "disseizor"); and he, or even a third person who takes fruits or branches from land thus withheld from the true owner, is considered as morally guilty of robbery (see the prohibition of an Israelite using, in the ritual thyrsus on the Feast of Booths, a palm-branch or citron taken from land held by a disseizor [Suk. iv. 1, 2]). The liability to pay mesne profits is implied and rather distantly indicated in the Mishnah (Giṭ. v. 2). Assuming that he who sells land with warranty is liable not only for the price of the land which he receives, but also for the mesne profits which the purchaser will have to pay after eviction to the true owner, it is here taught that from motives of public policy the warranty inserted in the deed of sale, though in the nature of a bond, is to be levied, as far as it secures the purchaser against this liability, only upon "free property," not on "subjected property," i.e., on lands which in the meanwhile have been given away, sold, or encumbered (for the distinction see Deed). The Gemara (B. M. 14a, b) discusses this matter fully in the light of the warranty, the liability of the unlawful possessor being taken for granted (see Maimonides, "Yad," Gezelah, ch. xiv.).

=== Depasturing ===
A liability for full damages is imposed by Ex. xxii. 4 (Hebr.). "If a man pastures on field or vineyard and sends his cattle to pasture in the field of another, he shall make it good with the best of his field and the best of his vineyard." When he pastures thus purposely, it is really a trespass; but the liability for "foot or tooth" is often as full when beasts go of themselves into the domain of another. Accidental injuries of this kind have been referred to under Accident. But when a beast eats the neighbor's produce, is the owner liable for the harm done, or only for his profit by its eating? In the case put in Scripture he is of course bound for the former. Other cases are thus put byMaimonides ("Yad," Nizḳe Mamon, iii. 6-12), who draws from B. Ḳ. 14-27 ''passim'':

=== Wilful and Accidental ===
Liability for damages varies depending on whether accidental damage may be anticipated. The following examples are instructive and serve as precedents.

When, from necessity, one's animal eats an unusual food, e.g., when a donkey eats fish, the owner pays full damage. (Liability applies on the grounds of the injured party; but if on the highway, the owner pays only the amount which he has profited). Where a beast of prey enters the grounds of the injured party and tears or devours a domestic animal, the owner of the beast is liable for full damage, because it is its nature to act in the manner as it did: but if a dog should trespass and eat lambs or a cat eat grown hens, only half damage is due; for this is unusual. When a donkey, finding bread in a basket, eats the bread and breaks the basket, the owner pays full damage for both. Where a beast, whether walking or standing, eats grass from the middle of a square, the owner pays what he profits: where it eats from the side he pays full damage. For what it eats out of the door of a shop, its owner is required to pay the equivalent of what he has profited thereby; from the interior of the shop, full damage. If, walking along the road, a beast eats off the back of another beast, only the saving in fodder is paid for; if it jumps out of its place, full damage is due. If one's beast glides or stumbles into another's garden and eats, etc., the owner owes only for what he profits, even if the beast goes from bed to bed, or stays in the garden all day; but if it walks into the garden in the regular way, there is liability for full damage. So, also, if it is pushed into the garden by a companion; for the owner should lead his herd in single file.

=== Unintentional Injury ===
Though "a man is always forewarned", that is, liable for his actions, asleep or awake, intentional or unintentional (see Assault and Battery, and authorities there cited), there is a broad exception to the rule; viz., when the mischief is done on the ground of the injuring party. For what a man does within his own domain, he is liable in damages only if it was done wilfully; but he is not liable if done either unconsciously or under compulsion. Where a man climbs a ladder, and a rung falls out under him and strikes another, he is liable if the rung was not strong enough or not well set; but if it was strong and well set, the harm done is regarded as providential, and he goes clear, even if it happened within the domain of the injured party; while on his own ground he would go clear in either case ("Yad," Ḥobel, iv. 3, 4, based on B. Ḳ. 28).

=== Betrayal: Informers ===
The man of violence ("annas," generally denoting an arbitrary or cruel official of the Gentile kingdom) is often mentioned in the Talmud and the codes. The most odious among torts was that of betraying the person or property of a fellow Israelite into the hands of the annas (see B. Ḳ. 5a, 114a; "Yad," Ḥobel, viii.; Shulḥan 'Aruḳ, Ḥoshen Mishpaṭ, 328). In the 'Aruk it is put thus: "He who [by informing] delivers up property into the hands of an annas, whether Gentile or Jew, is bound to make good, from the best part of his estate, whatever the annas has taken, though he has not handled the thing at all, but has only shown the way; and if he dies, the damage done is levied from his estate in the hands of his heirs." The informer is excused if he has given information under bodily duress; but if he has handled the property himself, he is liable even then; for a man has no right to save himself at the cost of another. Further on, a religious sanction is given to this civil liability: "He who delivers up an Israelite, either in his body or in his property, to the Gentile has no share in the world to come." And on the strength of a case reported in B. B. 116a it is also said that it is not only permissible but meritorious to kill an informer in order to put a stop to his villainous trade.

=== Slander and Insult: Elder "Put to Shame" ===
In ordinary Assault and Battery, an incidental insult or humiliation needs to be paid for separately. However, when there is only an insult and no physical assault, such as one spits at another person without reaching the body (even if it reaches the garment), there is no ground for recovery (BḲ 91a). Along these lines, a Palestinian amora recounts the tradition that "He who shames another by words is free from everything." But the Jerusalem Talmud (BḲ 6c) makes an exception in favor of the "elder," meaning a rabbi. Thus: "He who puts an elder to shame pays him the price of his shame. One Meshullam affronted R. Judah ben Ḥanina: the matter came before R. [[Simeon ben Laḳish]]; and he fined Meshullam a litra of gold." This precedent was carried into the Halakah; and all the Geonim followed it. They applied it to every scholar (), and thus the rule appears in the code of Maimonides ("Yad," Ḥobel, iii. 5), where the penalty is put at 35 denarii of gold (the weight of 8 8/4 shekels of gold); but he adds that in Spain many of the scholars waive their privilege. While others than scholars have no civil remedy for insult or slander, the act of "blanching a man's face in public" or that of "attaching a nickname to one's neighbor" is, as has been seen in Ona'ah, among the unpardonable sins punished in the future world. It is also found (Ket. 46a) that the sin of "bringing out an evil report" (slander) is fully recognized, on the strength of the text "Thou shalt not go up and down as a tale-bearer among the people" (Lev. xix. 16); but there is no civil remedy for the wrong done.

== History ==

DesignBuildBLUFF was founded in 2000 by University of Utah Professor, Hank Louis. The program is modeled on a [[design-build]] program at [[Auburn University]], known as the [[Rural Studio]], which was founded by [[Samuel Mockbee]]. In the Rural Studio model, students abandon the comforts of campus and home for a cooperative life, to learn about [[architecture]] through action. The design-build paradigm emphasizes experimentation, scale mock-ups, in-process design iterations, consensus-building through ideas and emotions, and juxtaposing diametrically opposed cultures.&lt;ref name=UoUweb/&gt;&lt;ref name=archrecord/&gt;&lt;ref name=inhabitat/&gt;

Since its inception Design Build Bluff has expanded to include The University of Colorado Denver in 2010, and more recently evolved from an independent non-profit to being formally housed within the University of Utah. Hank Louis has since passed leadership, and in 2013 the program welcomed new director, José Galarza, who came from the [[Yestermorrow Design/Build School]].

== Design and Construction ==
The program emphasizes the design and construction of homes using "green-build" techniques such as [[passive solar]], [[rainwater catchment]], [[permaculture]], [[earthen plaster]], [[rammed earth]], [[straw bale construction]], [[cellulose insulation]], Icynene foam (a green, water-based, open-celled building insulation product), and materials salvaged from the landscape of the reservation itself such as a substratum of natural clay, and reed from the local riverbed.&lt;ref name=UoUweb/&gt;

Design plans are formatted around donated and recycled materials such as lumber, windows, doors and appliances. Additionally, some of the homes are built from a unique material, FlexCrete, a new concrete block product made with fibrous aggregate from the surrounding soil, produced locally on the Navajo Nation, thereby further reducing the need to import building materials. The projects are completed on a modest cash budget, largely due to grant funding, and made possible by the generosity of the local design and construction community. Annual donors such as Big D Construction and 3Form have been involved in the projects for many years. Building sustainable, off-grid homes that have little impact on the environment accomplishes for the Navajo Nation the mission of respecting the landscape while providing adequate housing. As the program includes more community based projects it hopes to reinforce the relationship with the Navajo people, align with community goals, and maintain relevance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6361">The '''Dorothy Talbye Trial''' (1638) is an early [[United States|American]] example of a trial of an [[insanity|insane]] woman at a time when the insane were treated no differently from ordinary [[criminals]]. Talbye was [[hanged]] in 1639  for killing her three-year-old daughter because, she claimed, [[God]] told her to do so.&lt;ref name="jrank"/&gt;&lt;ref name="journal"/&gt;
Although [[Puritan]] Governor [[John Winthrop]] of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] saw Talbye as [[Demonic possession|possessed by Satan]], the penalty for [[murder]] was necessarily [[death penalty|death]].&lt;ref name="kill"/&gt;

==Circumstances==
Dorothy Talbye was a respectable member of the church in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] who became increasingly [[Psychotic depression|melancholic]], with fits of [[violence]]. Governor [[John Winthrop]] ascribed the woman's despondency  to [[delusion]]s or "trouble of mind", stemming from  "falling at difference with her husband, through melancholy or spiritual delusions [ ...so that] she sometimes attempted to kill him, and her children, and herself, by refusing meat, saying it was so revealed to her..." through [[revelation]]s he believes were from Satan. He described how church members tried to intervene.&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Talbye did not listen to admonishments  by the  [[Elder (Christianity)|church elders]] and was [[excomunication|cast out]] of the church.  She failed to appear before the Quarterly Court for [[assault]]ing her husband  as ordered in  April 1637. Therefore, she was ordered to be [[Physical restraint|bound]] and [[Stocks|chained to a post]] until her behavior changed. In July 1637 she was publicly [[Flagellation|whipped]] for [[infraction]]s against her husband.&lt;ref name="laurel"&gt;{{cite web

In  November 1638, she killed her daughter, named Difficulty, by breaking her neck, an act to which she freely confessed later and was charged with [[murder]].&lt;ref name="jrank"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At her trial Talbye was uncooperative, refusing to speak until John Winthrop threatened to pile stones on her chest, at which point she pleaded guilty. She refused to repent at her trial or at her execution, and, remaining uncooperative, she actively fought her execution. She removed the cloth covering her head and put it under the [[noose]] to lessen the pain and even as she was swinging from the noose, she attempted to grab at a ladder to save herself.&lt;ref name="journal"/&gt;

==Significance==
In 1637, American colonial law regarding murder followed English [[common law]], the basis of which was essentially biblical.&lt;ref name="kill"/&gt;  The [[Bible]] was clear that the [[punishment]] for murder was [[death]].  Massachusetts law followed [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]] and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], which offered no other alternative. Any person killing another in "anger or cruelty of passion" shall be [[capital punishment|put to death]].&lt;ref name="kill"/&gt; Massachusetts's common law made no distinction between insanity and criminal behavior. The only punishment legally available for Dorothy Talbye was the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1641, the [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] was written as a first step at developing a body of law for the Massachusetts Bay Colony. It codified the following, giving some allowance for special situations, although it might not have helped Dorothy Talbye: "Children, Idiots, Distracted persons, and all that are strangers, or new comers to our plantation, shall have such allowances and dispensations in any cause whether Criminal or other as religion and reason require."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''DuckDuckGo''' ('''DDG''') is an Internet [[web search engine|search engine]] that emphasizes protecting searchers' [[internet privacy|privacy]] and avoiding the [[filter bubble]] of personalized search results.&lt;ref name="Buys" /&gt; DuckDuckGo distinguishes itself from other search engines by not profiling its users and by deliberately showing all users the same search results for a given search term,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://dontbubble.us/|title = dontbubble.us|date = |accessdate = 2014-09-12|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and emphasizes returning the best results, rather than the most results, generating those results from over 400 individual sources, including [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] sites such as [[Wikipedia]], and other search engines like [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], [[Yahoo!

== Overview ==

DuckDuckGo's results are a compilation of "over 400" sources,&lt;ref name="Sources"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://duck.co/help/results/sources|title=Sources|last=|first=|date=July 22, 2018|work=|accessdate=July 22, 2018|publisher=DuckDuckGo Support Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Yahoo! Search BOSS]]; [[Wikipedia]]; [[Wolfram Alpha]]; [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]]; its own [[Web crawler]] (the ''DuckDuckBot''); and others.&lt;ref name="Buys" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sources" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2011/04/18/wolframalpha-and-duckduckgo-partner-on-api-binding-and-search-integration/|title=Wolfram Alpha and DuckDuckGo Partner on API Binding and Search Integration|date=April 18, 2011|publisher=Wolframalpha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also uses data from [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] sites, including Wikipedia, to populate "Zero-click Info" boxes – grey boxes above the results that display topic summaries and related topics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

DuckDuckGo positions itself as a search engine that puts privacy first and as such it does not store IP addresses, does not log user information, and uses cookies only when required. Weinberg states: "By default, DuckDuckGo does not collect or share personal information. That is our privacy policy in a nutshell." However, they do maintain logs of all search terms used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://duckduckgo.com/privacy.html "DDG Privacy"]. Duckduckgo.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weinberg has refined the quality of his search engine results by deleting search results for companies he believes are ''[[content farm|content mills]]'', like [[Demand Media]]'s [[eHow]], which publishes 4000 articles per day produced by paid freelance writers, which Weinberg says is, "...low-quality content designed specifically to rank highly in Google's search index." DuckDuckGo also filters pages with substantial advertising.&lt;ref name="Mims26Jul10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/post.aspx?bid=377&amp;bpid=25532|title=The Search Engine Backlash Against 'Content Mills'|last=Mims|first=Christopher|date=July 26, 2010|work=[[Technology Review]]|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Instant Answers ===
In addition to the indexed search results, DuckDuckGo displays relevant results, called Instant Answers, on top of the search page. These Instant Answers are collected from either 3rd party APIs or static data sources like text files. The Instant Answers are called ''zeroclickinfo'' because the intention behind these is to provide what the user is searching for on the search result page itself so that the user does not have to click any results to find what they are looking for. As of August 9, 2018, there are 1231 Instant Answers active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://duck.co/ia|title=DuckDuckGo Instant Answers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Instant Answers are open source&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/duckduckgo/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=zeroclickinfo-|title=Instant Answer repositories on GitHub|accessdate=Jul 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are maintained on GitHub, where anyone can build or work on them.

=== Tor hidden service ===
In August 2010, DuckDuckGo introduced anonymous searching, including an exit enclave, for its search engine traffic using [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor network]] and enabling access through a [[Tor hidden service]]. This allows anonymity by routing traffic through a series of encrypted relays. Weinberg stated: "I believe this fits right in line with our privacy policy. Using Tor and DDG, you can now be end to end anonymous with your searching. And if you use our encrypted homepage, you can be end to end encrypted as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2010/08/duckduckgo-now-operates-a-tor-exit-enclave.html|title=DuckDuckGo now operates a Tor exit enclave|last=|first=|date=13 Aug 2010|website=Gabriel Weinberg's Blog|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231132520/http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2010/08/duckduckgo-now-operates-a-tor-exit-enclave.html|archive-date=31 December 2010|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voice search ===
In 2011, DuckDuckGo introduced voice search for users of the [[Google Chrome]] [[voice search]] extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012225047/http://duckduckgo.com/tools.html|title=DuckDuckGo Tools|date=2011-10-12|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bangs ===
DuckDuckGo includes "!Bang" keywords, which give users the ability to search on specific third-party websites – using the site's own search engine if applicable.

== History ==
DuckDuckGo was founded by [[Gabriel Weinberg]] on February 29, 2008 in [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania|Valley Forge]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006201326/https://dukgo.com/help/en_US/company/history|title=History|date=2013-10-06|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg is an entrepreneur who previously launched [[Names Database]], a now-defunct social network. Initially self-funded by Weinberg, DuckDuckGo is [[advertising]]-supported, but the user has the option to disable ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chouprojects.com/duckduckgo-search-engine/|title=Duck Duck Go Startup Profile|last=Chou|first=Jacky|date=January 29, 2015|website=Chouprojects.com|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The search engine is written in [[Perl]]&lt;ref name="Perl"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo/wiki/DuckDuckGoPerl |title = DuckDuckGoPerl · duckduckgo/duckduckgo Wiki · GitHub |publisher=GitHub |accessdate = May 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and runs on [[nginx]], [[FreeBSD]], and [[Linux]].&lt;ref name="Buys"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://ostatic.com/blog/duckduckgo-a-new-search-engine-built-from-open-source|title = DuckDuckGo: A New Search Engine Built from Open Source|last = Buys|first = Jon|date = July 10, 2010|publisher = GigaOM OStatic blog|accessdate = March 19, 2013|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110317053629/http://ostatic.com/blog/duckduckgo-a-new-search-engine-built-from-open-source|archivedate = March 17, 2011|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Architecture"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://help.duckduckgo.com/customer/portal/articles/216392-architecture|title = Architecture|date=January 28, 2013 |publisher=DuckDuckGo.com |accessdate= June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; DuckDuckGo is built primarily upon search [[Application programming interface|APIs]] from various vendors&lt;!-- no need to call out one, if there are more than 50--&gt;.

He said of the origin of the name: "Really it just popped in my head one day and I just liked it.

In July 2010, Weinberg started a DuckDuckGo community website (duck.co) to allow the public to report problems, discuss means of spreading the use of the search engine, request features, and discuss [[Open-sourcing|open sourcing]] the code.&lt;ref name="Community"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://duck.co/|title=duck.co – The DuckDuckGo Community|last=Weinberg|first=Gabriel|date=July 2010|website=|accessdate=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DuckDuckGo was self-funded until [[Union Square Ventures]] and angel investors invested in DuckDuckGo in October 2011. Union Square partner Brad Burnham stated, "We invested in DuckDuckGo because we became convinced that it was not only possible to change the basis of competition in search, it was time to do it."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burnham13Oct11"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usv.com/blog/duck-duck-go|title=Duck Duck Go|last=Burnham|first=Brad|date=October 13, 2011|website=Union Square Ventures blog|accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Trisquel]], [[Linux Mint]], and the [[Midori (web browser)|Midori]] web browser switched to use DuckDuckGo as their default search engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trisquel.info/en/issues/2608#comment-8213|title=DuckDuckGo in Web Browser|author=Mithrandir|first=|date=November 25, 2010|website=|publisher=Trisquel.info|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2012, the search engine was attracting 1.5&amp;nbsp;million searches a day. Weinberg reported that it had earned {{US$|115000}} in revenue in 2011 and had three employees, plus a small number of contractors.&lt;ref name="Farivar16May12"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://arstechnica.com/business/2012/05/private-the-search-engines-that-make-money-by-not-tracking-users/|title = Private: some search engines make money by not tracking users|last = Farivar|first = Cyrus|date = May 16, 2012| work = [[Ars Technica]]|accessdate = May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Compete.com]] estimated 266,465 unique visitors to the site in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324100607/http://siteanalytics.compete.com/duckduckgo.com/?metric=uv|title=duckduckgo.com 266,465.0 UVs for February 2012 {{!}} Compete|date=2012-03-24|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 12, 2011, [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] reported a 3-month growth rate of 51%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alexa.com/siteinfo/duckduckgo.com |title=DuckDuckGo Analytics Profile |publisher=Alexa.com}}&lt;!-- get a WebCitation capture for each As of date --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; DuckDuckGo's own [[traffic statistics]] show that in August 2012 there were 1,393,644 visits per day, up from an average of 39,406 visits per day in April 2010 (the earliest data available).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://duckduckgo.com/traffic.html|title=DuckDuckGo Official traffic}}&lt;!-- get a WebCitation capture for each As of date --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In a lengthy profile in November 2012, [[The Washington Post|''The Washington Post'']] indicated that searches on DuckDuckGo numbered up to 45,000,000 per month in October 2012. The article concluded: "Weinberg's non-ambitious goals make him a particularly odd and dangerous competitor online. He can do almost everything that [[Google Search|Google]] or [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] can't because it could damage their business models, and if users figure out that they like the DuckDuckGo way better, Weinberg could damage the big boys without even really trying.

In July 2016, DuckDuckGo officially announced the extension of its partnership with [[Yahoo! Search|Yahoo!]] that brought new features to all users of the search engine, including date filtering of results and additional site links. It also partners with Bing, Yandex, and Wikipedia to produce results or make use of features offered. The company also confirmed that it does not share user information with partner companies, as has always been its policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghacks.net/2016/07/01/duckduckgo-yahoo-partnership/|title=DuckDuckGo extends Yahoo partnership|last=Brinkmann|first=Martin|date=July 1, 2016|website=[[gHacks]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/duckduckgo/comments/4lgda4/duckduckgo_is_using_yahoo_for_searches_now/|title=DuckDuckGo is using yahoo for searches now.|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 23, 2018, DuckDuckGo revamped its browser extension and mobile app in an effort to keep internet users safe “beyond the search box”. The revamped extension and app include a tool for rating websites based on their use of encryption and ad tracking networks as well as the ability to block ad tracking networks. The extension also provides [[Terms of service]] summaries from [[Terms of Service; Didn't Read]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16922508/private-search-engine-duckduckgo-browser-extension-app|title=Privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo wants to keep you safe around the web|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In a June 2011 article, Harry McCracken of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] commended DuckDuckGo, comparing it to his favorite hamburger restaurant, [[In-N-Out Burger]]:
{{quote|It feels a lot like early Google, with a stripped-down home page. Just as In-N-Out doesn't have lattes or Asian salads or sundaes or scrambled eggs, DDG doesn't try to do news or blogs or books or images. There's no auto-completion or instant results. It just offers core Web search—mostly the "ten blue links" approach that's still really useful, no matter what its critics say ... As for the quality, I'm not saying that Weinberg has figured out a way to return more relevant results than Google's mighty search team. But DuckDuckGo ... is really good at bringing back useful sites. It all feels meaty and straightforward and filler-free ...&lt;ref name="McCracken16Jun11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://techland.time.com/2011/06/16/duck-duck-go-the-in-n-out-burger-of-search-engines/#ixzz1PXPmPOeK|title=Duck Duck Go, the In-N-Out Burger of Search Engines|last=McCracken|first=Harry|date=June 14, 2011|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}} The barebones approach cited in his quote have since changed; DuckDuckGo now has auto-completion and instant results for example.

Thom Holwerda, who reviewed the search engine for ''[[OSNews]]'', praised its privacy features and shortcuts to site-specific searches as well as criticizing Google for "track[ing] pretty much everything you do", particularly because of the risk of such information being subject to a [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] subpoena.&lt;ref name="Holwerda21Jun11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/24867/DuckDuckGo_The_Privacy-centric_Alternative_to_Google|title=DuckDuckGo: The Privacy-centric Alternative to Google|date=June 21, 2011|last=Holwerda|first=Thom|publisher=[[OSNews]]|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, in response to accusations that it was a monopoly, [[Google]] identified DuckDuckGo as a competitor.

'''Early case assessment''' refers to estimating [[risk]] (cost of time and money) to [[prosecute]] or [[Lawyer|defend]] a [[legal case]].  Global organizations deal with [[legal discovery]] and [[Discovery (law)|disclosure]] requests for [[electronically stored information]] "ESI" and [[paper]] documents on a regular basis.

Over 90% of all cases settle prior to [[trial]].  Often an organization will spend significant time and money on a case only to find they want to settle for whatever reason.  [[Legal discovery]] costs are usually the most burdensome financially to both [[plaintiff]] and [[defendant]].  Often, and during cases in the [[United States]], an opposing party will strategize on how to make it as difficult as possible for you to comply with the discovery process, including time and cost to respond to discovery requests.  Because of this, organizations have a continued need to conduct early case assessment to determine their [[risks]] and  [[wikt:benefits|benefits]] of taking a case to trial without painful settlement discussions.

Many service organizations, law firms, and corporations refer to early case assessment differently.  Consultants hired by the corporation or law firm on a case manage cases on a risk basis. There also exist a number of software tools that assist in and help facilitate the process of early case assessment. Effective early case assessment might require the combination of professional expertise and software. This pairing, depending on the professional and tools used can provide various degrees of early case assessment review.  Early case assessment, as a managed process, often requires customization to each case and the client involved.

The early case assessment lifecycle will typically include all of the following:

The software approach to early case assessment typically includes the following:
#Determine the source files to analyze.
#Point the analysis tool to the files to be analyzed.
#Set parameters for the assessment.
#Allow the program to automatically scan and assess the data, which may be located on local hard drives, removable media, file servers, whole networks, etc.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10829">The '''Godesberg Memorandum''' is a document issued by [[Adolf Hitler]] in the early hours of 24 September 1938 concerning the [[Sudetenland]] and amounting to an [[ultimatum]] addressed to the government of [[Czechoslovakia]]. 

It was named after [[Bad Godesberg]], where Hitler had met [[Neville Chamberlain]] for long talks on 23 September continuing into the next day.

==Background==
{{Main|Sudeten Germans}}
At the time of the collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the [[Sudetenland]] was a German-speaking part of the Empire which fell to the new state of Czechoslovakia, itself dominated by the [[Czechs]]. Initially, many [[Sudeten Germans]] wished to become part of the new German-speaking state of [[Republic of German-Austria|German Austria]], and later they hoped to join [[Austria]]. However, the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] of 1919 confirmed the inclusion of the German-speaking territories within Czechoslovakia. By the beginning of 1938 most Sudetens aspired to be integrated into [[Nazi Germany]], which was fast advancing in economic success and international prestige.

Following an active [[propaganda]] campaign, Adolf Hitler began publicly to demand the "return" to Germany of a large part of the Sudetenland containing some three million German speakers.&lt;ref&gt;S. N. Sen, ''Contemporary World'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1938 [[France]] and the [[Soviet Union]] gave guarantees of military support to Czechoslovakia if Hitler began to use military force to seize the Sudetenland, but on 24 March [[Neville Chamberlain]] refused a French request to give the same pledge.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; 

In early September 1938, Chamberlain sent [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Lord Runciman]] to attempt to negotiate a settlement of the crisis between the Germans and the Czechs. On 7 September the Sudetens, led by [[Konrad Henlein]], broke off the talks with Runciman, and on 12 September Hitler publicly advised the Sudetens to stand firm for union with Germany. On 15 September Chamberlain flew to [[Berchtesgaden]] to meet Hitler, who demanded [[self determination]] for the Sudetenland. Upon his return to London after his Berchtesgaden summit, Chamberlain told his Cabinet that Hitler's aims were "strictly limited" to the Sudetenland, and he felt it was quite possible to avoid war provided everyone played their part.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Weinberg, ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II'', p. 438&lt;/ref&gt; He also had discussions with the French, in which he agreed with them a joint proposal to all parties for the gradual transfer to Germany of the areas which had a majority of Sudeten Germans.&lt;ref name=sen62&gt;Sen, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chamberlain returned to Germany, meeting Hitler on 22 September at [[Bad Godesberg]] to propose this solution.&lt;ref name=sen62/&gt; In presenting their peace plan for the transfer of the Sudetenland, the British delegation was most unpleasantly surprised to hear Hitler reject the terms he had himself presented at Berchtesgaden as now unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Middlemas]], ''Diplomacy of Illusion'' (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1972), p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler now demanded an immediate transfer, including occupation of the Sudetenland by German forces, and he quickly issued the "Godesberg Memorandum" to clarify his public position.&lt;ref name=sen62/&gt;

==Content==
In his Memorandum Hitler proposed a [[plebiscite]], without identifying the exact area for it, and provided for the plebiscite areas to be occupied by both German and Czech forces, pending the outcome of voting. German forces should enter the Sudetenland by 1 October.&lt;ref&gt;Terrance L. Lewis, ''Prisms of British Appeasement'' (2011), p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler demanded the Sudetenland be ceded to Germany no later than September 28, 1938 with no negotiations between Prague and Berlin and no international commission to oversee the transfer; no plebiscites to be held in the transferred districts until after the transfer; and he also declared that Germany would not abandon war as an option until all the claims against Czechoslovakia by Poland and Hungary had been satisfied. This was seen as a signal that Hitler had decided to put an end to Chamberlain’s peace-making efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt;  The arrangements for the transfer were to be decided bilaterally between the Germans and the Czechs and by no one else.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Chamberlain, ''In Search of Peace''&lt;/ref&gt;

The "memorandum" stated an ultimatum for Czech acceptance of it, expiring at 2 pm on 28 September 1938. If the Czech government would not agree to Hitler's demands by then, Germany would take the Sudetenland by force.&lt;ref&gt;''Life'' dated 26 April 1948, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Chamberlain protested about being presented with an ultimatum, to which Hitler replied that the document was entitled “Memorandum”, so could not be called an ultimatum.&lt;ref&gt;David Dilks, 'We Must Hope For The Best and Prepare For The Worse' from ''The Origins of The Second World War'' edited by Patrick Finney (London: Arnold, 1997), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response and outcome==
{{Main|Munich Agreement}}

The Czechs announced on 28 September that they rejected the Memorandum, and the French ordered the mobilization of 600,000 men. The [[Royal Navy]] was also mobilized the same day.&lt;ref name=sen62/&gt;

Although Hitler was angry at the rejection of his memorandum, he also feared a war against both Britain and France.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Thomsett, ''The German Opposition to Hitler: The Resistance, the Underground, ...'' (2007), p. 121: "Hitler was furious upon hearing that the British, French, and Czechs had all rejected his Godesberg memorandum. Hitler knew, however, that Germany's armed forces were no match for those of France and Britain."&lt;/ref&gt; He did not order an invasion on 28 September, having instead agreed to Chamberlain's proposal for a further meeting the next day, now at [[Munich]], between four heads of government, Chamberlain for Britain, Hitler for Germany, [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Édouard Daladier|Daladier]] for France and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] for Italy, with no Czech or Soviet participation. On 1 October, a pact was signed which provided for possession of the Sudeten Province to be transferred to Germany, with Britain and France seeking to sweeten this bitter pill for the Czechs by guaranteeing the new borders of Czechoslovakia. There was also a separate agreement between the British and the Germans that stated that all future disputes between them would be the subject of negotiation.&lt;ref name=sen62/&gt;

On 1 October, German troops marched into the Sudetenland, which was immediately incorporated into Germany. Some 115,000 Sudeten Czechs and 30,000 Sudeten Germans, including Social Democrats, Communists and Jews, fled to what was left of Czechoslovakia. By 1 March 1939, the number of refugees, as reported by the Institute for Refugee Assistance, stood at almost 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio.cz/en/article/46238 Forced displacement of Czech population under Nazis in 1938 and 1943] at radio.cz, accessed 27 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
* 10 September 1938 — In a speech at [[Nuremberg]], [[Hermann Göring]] calls the Czechs a "miserable pygmy race" who are "harassing the human race". That evening [[Edvard Beneš]], President of [[Czechoslovakia]], broadcasts an appeal for calm.
* 15 September — Chamberlain arrives in [[Berchtesgaden]] to begin negotiations with Hitler
* 17 September — Chamberlain returns to London to confer with his cabinet.
* 22 September — Chamberlain arrives in [[Bad Godesberg]] for further talks with Hitler over the crisis. Hitler demands a German occupation of all German Sudeten territories by 1 October. That night, after a telephone conference, Chamberlain reverses his position and advises the Czechoslovaks to mobilize for war.
* 23 September - At 22.30 The Czechoslovak Government orders general mobilization. By 30 September more than 1 million men were prepared to defend the country
* 24 September — At 1.30 am Hitler and Chamberlain conclude their talks and Chamberlain agrees to take Hitler's demands, codified in the Godesberg Memorandum, to the Czechoslovak Government himself.
* 25 September —  The Czechs, the British cabinet, and the French government, reject the demands in the Memorandum and the French order a partial mobilization of their army.
* 26 September — In a speech in Berlin, Hitler hints that war with Czechoslovakia will begin at any moment.
* 28 September — As his deadline of 1 October for a German occupation of the Sudetenland approaches, Hitler invites Chamberlain, Benito Mussolini of Italy, and Edouard Daladier of France, to a final conference in [[Munich]]. The Czechs are not invited. Royal Navy is mobilized for war.
* 29 September [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]] informs Colonel Graham Christie, assistant British military attaché in Berlin, that the mobilization of the Royal Navy has badly damaged the popularity of the Nazi regime, as Germans realize that ''[[Fall Grün (Czechoslovakia)|Fall Grün]]'' is leading towards war.
* 29 September — [[Munich Agreement]]: The German, Italian, British and French heads of government agree to the German demands regarding the annexation of the [[Sudetenland]]. Czechoslovakia is not a signatory to the agreement.
* 30 September — Neville Chamberlain returns to London and declares "[[Peace for our time]]".
* 1 October — German troops march into the Sudetenland. The Polish government gives the Czech government an ultimatum stating that [[Zaolzie]] region must be handed over within twenty-four hours. The Czechs have little choice but to comply. Polish forces occupy [[Zaolzie]].
* 5 October — In the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Winston Churchill]] calls the outcome of the crisis "A total and unmitigated defeat. France and Britain had to choose between war and dishonour. They chose dishonour. They will have war".
* 16 October — Germany expels 12,000 Polish Jews from Germany; Poland accepts 4,000 and refuses admission to the remaining 8,000, who are left in the "no-man's land" at the German-Polish frontier.
* 24 October — At [[Berchtesgaden]], foreign minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] tells [[Józef Lipski]], Polish ambassador to Germany, that the [[Free City of Danzig]] must return to Germany, the Germans must be given extraterritorial rights in the [[Polish Corridor]], and that Poland must sign the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2872">{{Politics of Guam}}

A '''two-part referendum ''' was held in [[Guam]] on 4 August 1979. A proposed new constitution was rejected by 82% of voters, whilst a law introducing the death penalty was rejected by 53% of voters.&lt;ref name=GEC&gt;[https://drive.google.com/a/gec.guam.gov/file/d/0B62DVqWtLI3yTVBOMzZHR09wdG8/edit?usp=sharing Election Comparative Analysis Report] Guam Election Commission, pp56–57&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1987 a [[Guamanian constitutional referendum, August 1987|referendum]] was held on another proposed constitution, with each chapter voted on separately. Two chapters (I and VII) were rejected by voters, resulting in a [[Guamanian constitutional referendum, November 1987|second referendum]] in November in which both were approved.

==Background==
On 21 October 1976 the [[United States Congress]] had approved the establishment of Constitutional Councils for Guam and the [[United States Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=gu011979 Guam (USA), 4 August 1979: Constitution] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;In December 1976 the [[Legislature of Guam|Guamanian Legislature]] decided to hold an [[Guamanian Constitutional Council election, 1977|election]] for the Council.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

In 1978 US President [[Jimmy Carter]] approved the proposed 14-chapter constitution, and a referendum was scheduled for 7 November.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; However, following a dispute over the [[Guamanian general election, 1978|gubernatorial election]], it was postponed until 1979.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

The '''Habeas Corpus Act 1679'''  is an [[Act of Parliament]] in England (31 Cha. 2 c. 2) during the reign of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]].&lt;ref name="BHO001"&gt;{{cite web |title=Charles II, 1679: An Act for the better secureing the Liberty of the Subject and for Prevention of Imprisonments beyond the Seas. |work=Statutes of the Realm: volume 5: 1628–80 (1819)| pages=935–938 |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=47484. |accessdate=6 March 2007 |publisher=British History Online }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was passed by what became known as the [[Habeas Corpus Parliament]] to define and strengthen the ancient prerogative writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', which required a court to examine the lawfulness of a prisoner's detention and thus prevent unlawful or arbitrary imprisonment.&lt;ref name="BBC20050309" /&gt;

==Earlier and subsequent history==
The Act is often wrongly described as the origin of the writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]''. But the writ of ''habeas corpus'' had existed in various forms in England for at least five centuries before and is thought to have originated in the 12th Century [[Assize of Clarendon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/medieval/assizecl.asp |title= Assize of Clarendon, 1166 |publisher=The Avalon Project |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was guaranteed, but not created, by [[Magna Carta#Clauses still in force|Magna Carta in 1215]], whose article 39 reads: "No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or disseised or exiled or in any way destroyed, nor will we go upon him nor will we send upon him except upon the lawful judgement of his peers or the law of the land."&lt;ref name="BBC20050309"&gt;{{cite news |title=A brief history of habeas corpus |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4329839.stm |accessdate=25 October 2014 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=9 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act of 1679 followed an earlier [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640|Habeas Corpus Act]] of [[List of Acts of the Parliament of England, 1603–41#1640 (16 Chas. 1)|1640]], which established that the command of the King or the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] was no answer to a petition of ''habeas corpus''. Further Habeas Corpus Acts were passed by the British Parliament in 1803, 1804, [[Habeas Corpus Act 1816|1816]], and 1862, but it is the Act of 1679 which is remembered as one of the most important statutes in English constitutional history. Though amended, it remains on the statute book to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Cha2/31/2/contents |title=Habeas Corpus Act 1679 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
In criminal matters other than treason and felonies, the act gave prisoners or third parties acting on their behalf the right to challenge their detention by demanding from the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Judiciary of England and Wales|Justices of the King's Bench]], and the [[Exchequer of Pleas|Barons of the Exchequer]] of the jurisdiction a judicial review of their imprisonment. The act laid out certain temporal and geographical conditions under which prisoners had to be brought before the courts. Jailors were forbidden to move prisoners from one prison to another or out of the country to evade the writ. In case of disobedience jailers would be punished with severe fines which had to be paid to the prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Acevedo|first1=John Filipe|editor1-last=Miller|editor1-first=Wilbur R.|title=The Social History of Crime and Punishment in America: An Encyclopedia|date=212|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd.|location=London, United Kingdom|page=729}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Documentary History of Human Rights| editor=Jon. E. Lewis. |place=New York |publisher= Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|year=2003 |page=267|quote=Habeas Corpus Act (1679). In 1660, the Stuarts re-ascended the throne of England. Old tendencies towards Catholicism and absolutism proved little diminished, however, and a prudently watchful parliament determined to pass an Act enshrining Habeas Corpus. This was an ancient English right that, if a man was imprisoned by a local lord, his friends could request the king to issue a writ commanding the man who "have the body" (''Habeas Corpus'') of the prisoner to bring the prisoner before a magistrate for a proper trial. Under a tyrannous king, such as Charles I, the process could be wilfully ignored. In 1679, Parliament passed the ''Habeas Corpus'' Act against future abuse. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The following are the main provisions: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whereas great delays have been used by sheriffs... to whose custody any of the king’s subjects have been committed for criminal or supposed criminal matters... by other shifts to avoid their yielding obedience to [writs of ''Habeas Corpus''], contrary to their duty and the known laws of the land, whereby many of the king's subjects have been... long detained in prison in such cases where by law they are bailable... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; II For the prevention whereof and the more speedy relief of all persons imprisoned for any such criminal or supposed criminal matters; be it enacted by the king's most excellent Majesty, by and with the consent of the lords... that whensoever any person or persons shall bring any ''habeas corpus'' directed to any sheriff... that the said officer... shall within three days... bring or cause to be brung the body of the party so committed... before the lord chancellor... unless the commitment of the said party by in any place beyond the distance of twenty miles from the place or places where such court of person is or shall be residing, and if beyond the distance of twenty miles and not above one hundred miles then within the space of ten days of such delivery and not longer...  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; V And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that if any officer or officers... shall neglect or refuse to make the returns aforesaid... [he]shall for the first offence forfeit to the prisoner or party grieved the sum of one hundred pounds...  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; VI ... be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that no person or persons, which shall be delivered or set at large upon any ''habeas corpus'', shall at any time hereafter again be imprisoned or committed for the same offence ... other than by the legal order and process of such [appropriate] court... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; X Provided also, and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall and may be lawful to and for any prisoner and prisoners as aforesaid to move and obtain his or their ''habeas corpus'' as well out of the high court of chancery or court of exchequer as out of the court of king's bench or common pleas...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parliamentary history==
The Act came about because [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|the Earl of Shaftesbury]] encouraged his friends in the Commons to introduce the Bill where it passed and was then sent up to the House of Lords. Shaftesbury was the leading [[Exclusion Bill|Exclusionist]]—those who wanted to exclude Charles II's brother [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]] from the succession—and the Bill was a part of that struggle as they believed James would rule arbitrarily. The Lords decided to add many [[wrecking amendment]]s to the Bill in an attempt to kill it; the Commons had no choice but to pass the Bill with the Lords' amendments because they learned that the King would soon end the current [[parliamentary session]].

The Bill went back and forth between the [[List of Parliaments of England#Parliaments of Charles II|two Houses]], and then the Lords voted on whether to set up a conference on the Bill. If this motion was defeated the Bill would stay in the Commons and therefore have no chance of being passed. Each side—those voting for and against—appointed a [[Teller (elections)|teller]] who stood on each side of the door through which those Lords who had voted "aye" re-entered the House (the "nays" remained seated). One teller would count them aloud whilst the other teller listened and kept watch to know if the other teller was telling the truth. Shaftesbury's faction had voted for the motion, so they went out and re-entered the House. [[Gilbert Burnet]], one of Shaftesbury's friends, recorded what then happened:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lord Grey and Lord Norris were named to be the tellers: Lord Norris, being a man subject to vapours, was not at all times attentive to what he was doing: so, a very fat lord coming in, Lord Grey counted him as ''ten'', as a jest at first: but seeing Lord Norris had not observed it, he went on with this misreckoning of ten: so it was reported that they that were for the Bill were in the majority, though indeed it went for the other side: and by this means the Bill passed.&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;Quoted in J. E. Powell, ''Great Parliamentary Occasions'' 1966: The Queen Anne Press. p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[clerk (position)|clerk]] recorded in the minutes of the Lords that the "ayes" had fifty-seven and the "nays" had fifty-five, a total of 112, but the same minutes also state that only 107 Lords had attended that sitting.&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt;

The King arrived shortly thereafter and gave [[Royal Assent]] before proroguing Parliament. The Act is now stored in the [[Parliamentary Archives]].

The '''Hasba bill''' ([[Urdu]]: '''حسبہ قانون'''; ''accountability bill'') was [[bill (proposed law)|legislation]] proposed by members of the provincial assembly of the [[North-West Frontier Province, Pakistan]], which  borders [[Afghanistan]]. The political party in power in the province at that time was the [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]] (MMA), which was an alliance of six religious parties endorsing a system of Islamic justice ([[sharia]]). In 2003 the Hasba Bill (Sharia implementation Bill) was approved by the same assembly; which mandates sharia in the province. The Hasba bill sought official recognition for the implementation of sharia ([[hisbah]]); hence the name of the bill. 

The Hasba bill was blocked by the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]]. Chief Justice [[Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry]] declared it to be unconstitutional.

'''''In re Estate of Gardiner''''', [[case citation|42 P.3d 120]] (Kan. 2002), is a case in which the [[Kansas Supreme Court]] voided the marriage of a man and a [[trans woman]], holding that the latter was considered male under Kansas law, and thus the state's prohibition on [[same-sex marriage]] precluded the legal validity of the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strasser|first=Mark|year=2003|title=Harvesting the Fruits of Gardiner: On Marriage, Public Policy, and Fundamental Interests|journal=George Washington Law Review|volume=71|page=179|ssrn=439524}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SteeghSteegh2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oliphant|first1=Robert E.|last2=Steegh|first2=Nancy Ver|title=Examples &amp; Explanations: Family Law, 2nd Ed.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0pa0KOsvroC&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=13 November 2012|date=2007-03-07|publisher=Aspen Publishers Online|isbn=9780735562899|pages=45–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2002/03/22/kansas_ruling/|title=Same-sex marriage, with a twist|last=Link|first=David|date=March 22, 2002|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|accessdate=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J'Noel Ball married Marshall G. Gardiner in [[Oskaloosa, Kansas|Oskaloosa]], [[Jefferson County, Kansas]] in September 1998. Marshall, who had previously twice served in the [[Kansas House of Representatives]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB962922787664677618|title=Double Bind: Why a Woman in Missouri  Is a Man in Kansas, and Why It Matters|last=Spurgeon|first=Devon|date=July 7, 2000|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; died in August of the following year, [[Intestacy|without having left a will]]. Marshall's son, Joe, challenged the disposition of the $2.5 million [[estate (law)|estate]], arguing that J'Noel was legally male and therefore that the marriage was invalid. The district court agreed with the son, at appeal, the [[Kansas Court of Appeals]] reversed the district court, and the Supreme Court reversed the appellate court in part and [[Appeal#Results|affirmed]] the district court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83829345.html|title=Kansas Supreme Court rules against transsexual (subscription required)|last=Lamoy|first=Annie|author2=Stacy Downs|date=March 15, 2002 |work=Knight Ridder / Tribune News Service|accessdate=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NorgrenNorgren2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norgren|first1=Jill|last2=Norgren|first2=Serena Nanda, Jill|title=American Cultural Pluralism And Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cnKyJOfVQgwC&amp;pg=PA200|accessdate=13 November 2012|date=2006-07-30|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275986995|pages=200–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MyersMyers2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myers|first1=Gordon Brown, Scott|last2=Myers|first2=Scott|title=Administration of Wills, Trusts, and Estate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-TtzVLWuqUC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=13 November 2012|date=2008-06-16|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781428321762|pages=85–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] denied [[certiorari]] on October 7, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;''Gardiner v. Gardiner'', 537 U.S. 825 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling has also been described as "de-sex"ing transgender people, based on the court statement that the "words 'sex,' 'marriage,' 'male,' and 'female' in everyday understanding do not encompass transsexuals."&lt;ref name="CurrahJuang2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Currah|first1=Paisley|last2=Juang|first2=Richard M.|last3=Minter|first3=Shannon Price|title=Transgender Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUwOKayHVwcC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=13 November 2012|year=2006|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816643127|pages=37–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because J'Noel was born in [[Wisconsin]], and the laws of that state allowed her to change the sex on her [[birth certificate]], the ruling has been criticized for as violating the [[full faith and credit]] clause of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gebhardt|first=Shawn|year=2009|title=Full Faith and Credit for Status Records: A Reconsideration of Gardiner|journal=California Law Review|volume=97|pages=1419–|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1124&amp;context=californialawreview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==References==
{{Reflist}}12 Although Marshall and J'Noel Gardiner were humanists, the Kansas Supreme Court, all Christian, ruled that as she was incapable of bearing a child, she was not a full woman
13As a result of the ruling, the administration of Professor Gardiner's employer, Park University, dismissed her after nine years of service.  She filed a Missouri EEO claim for religious discrimination and investigator, Mary Shepard, told her since she, Gardiner was white, she had not claim.  When Gardiner insisted it was a religious claim, Shepard changed the gender in her report to "he."
14Gardiner's US Passport, civilian military I.D., Wisconsin birth certificate, and other legal forms were disregarded by the Kansas courts and when J'Noel Gardiner traveled to other theocratic countries and states within the United States, fears arrest at immigration points, using public restrooms, etc.
14J'Noel Gardiner took her life in 2014 leaving a note saying she the Kansas courts and Park University destroyed her professionally and personally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9971">"'''Information wants to be free'''" is an expression that means all people should be able to access information freely. It is often used by technology activists to criticize laws that limit transparency and general access to information. People who criticize [[Intellectual property#Criticisms|intellectual property]] law say the system of such government granted monopolies conflicts with the development of a public domain of information. The expression is often credited to [[Stewart Brand]], who was recorded saying it at a hackers conference in 1984.&lt;ref name="R. Polk Wagner"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.law.upenn.edu/fac/pwagner/wagner.control.pdf | title = Information wants to be free: intellectual property and the mythologies of control| first = R Polk | last = Wagner | publisher = University of Pennsylvania | format = [[PDF]] essay}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The iconic phrase is attributed to [[Stewart Brand]],&lt;ref name="R. Polk Wagner"/&gt; who, in the late 1960s, founded the [[Whole Earth Catalog]] and argued that technology could be liberating rather than oppressing.&lt;ref name="Ronald J. Baker"&gt;{{citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O5E_k2u7enkC&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=information%20wants%20to%20be%20free&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q=information%20wants%20to%20be%20free&amp;f=false | title = Mind over matter: why intellectual capital is the chief source of wealth | first = Ronald J | last = Baker | page = 80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded occurrence of the expression was at the first [[The Hackers Conference|Hackers Conference]] in 1984. Brand told [[Steve Wozniak]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge338.html | title = Edge 338 | journal = Edge | number = 338 | accessdate = 2011-04-23}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |On the one hand information wants to be expensive, because it's so valuable.  The right information in the right place just changes your life.  On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time.  So you have these two fighting against each other.&lt;ref name = "clarke"&gt;{{citation | first = Roger | last = Clarke | title = Information Wants to be Free | url = http://www.rogerclarke.com/II/IWtbF.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Brand's conference remarks are transcribed in the ''[[Whole Earth Review]]'' (May 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;49) and a later form appears in his ''The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at MIT'':&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | authorlink = Stewart Brand | first = Stewart | last = Brand | title = The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at MIT | publisher = Viking Penguin | year = 1987 | ISBN = 0-14-009701-5 | page = 202}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |Information Wants To Be Free.  Information also wants to be expensive.  ...That tension will not go away.&lt;ref name="clarke"/&gt;}}

According to historian Adrian Johns, the slogan expresses a view that had already been articulated in the mid-20th century by [[Norbert Wiener]], [[Michael Polanyi]] and [[Arnold Plant]], who advocated for the free communication of scientific knowledge, and specifically criticized the [[patent]] system. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Johns | first = Adrian | title = Piracy. The Intellectual Property Wars from Gutenberg to Gates | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | year = 2009 | ISBN = 978-0-226-40118-8 | page = 429 | quote = We still live amid the legacies of these mid-century debates about science and society. We inherit their terms, and the culture of science that shapes our world is the one left to us by them. If we think ‘information wants to be free,’ then we voice a sentiment championed by Wiener, Polanyi and Plant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Gratis'' versus ''Libre''==
{{Main|Gratis versus Libre}}
The various forms of the original statement are ambiguous: the slogan can be used to argue the benefits of propertied information, of liberated, free, and open information, or of both. It can be taken amorally as an expression of a fact of information-science: once information has passed to a new location outside of the source's control there is no way of ensuring it is not propagated further, and therefore will naturally tend towards a state where that information is widely distributed.  Much of its force is due to the [[pathetic fallacy|anthropomorphic metaphor]] that imputes desire to information.  In 1990 [[Richard Stallman]] restated the concept normatively, without the anthropomorphization:

Stallman's reformulation incorporates a political stance into Brand's [[Value judgment|value-neutral]] observation of social trends.

==Cyberpunks==
{{Main|Cyberpunk}}
Brand's attribution of will to an abstract human construct (information) has been adopted within a branch of the [[cyberpunk]] movement, whose members espouse a particular political ([[anarchist]]) viewpoint. The construction of the statement takes its meaning beyond the simple judgmental observation, "Information ''should'' be free" by acknowledging that the internal force or [[entelechy]] of information and knowledge makes it essentially incompatible with notions of [[proprietary software]], copyrights, patents, [[subscription service]]s, etc. They believe that information is dynamic, ever-growing and evolving and cannot be contained within (any) [[ideological]] structure.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

According to this philosophy, [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]], [[Software cracking|cracker]]s, and [[phreaker]]s are liberators of information which is being held hostage by agents demanding money for its release. Other participants in this network include [[Cypherpunk|cypherpunks]] who educate people to use [[public-key cryptography]] to protect the privacy of their messages from corporate or governmental snooping and [[programmer]]s who write free software and [[open source]] [[code]]. Still others create [[Free-Net]]s allowing users to gain access to computer resources for which they would otherwise need an account. They might also break copyright law  by swapping music, movies, or other copyrighted materials over the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

[[Chelsea Manning]] is alleged to have said "Information should be free"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/06/wikileaks-chat/ |title=‘I Can’t Believe What I’m Confessing to You’: The Wikileaks Chats |author=KEVIN POULSEN AND KIM ZETTER |work=Wired.com |date=6 October 2013 |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Adrian Lamo]] when explaining a rationale for US government documents to be released to [[WikiLeaks]]. The narrative goes on with Manning wondering if she is a "'hacker', 'cracker', 'hacktivist', 'leaker' or what".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nymag.com/news/features/bradley-manning-2011-7/index6.html |title=How Bradley Manning Became One of the Most Unusual Revolutionaries in American History |author=[[Steve Fishman]] |work=[[New York Magazine]] |date=3 July 2011 |accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary usage==
In the "[[The Star Fraction|Fall Revolution]]" series of [[Science fiction|science-fiction]] books, anarchist sci-fi author [[Ken Macleod]] riffs and puns on the expression by writing about entities composed of information actually "wanting", as in desiring, freedom and the scheming of several human characters with differing political and ideological agenda, to facilitate or disrupt these entities' quest for freedom.

In the cyberpunk world of [[Technological singularity|post-singularity]] transhuman culture described by [[Charles Stross]] in his books like ''[[Accelerando (novel)|Accelerando]]'' and ''[[Singularity Sky]]'', the wish of information to be free is a law of nature.&lt;ref name="accelerando"&gt;{{citation | url = http://trashotron.com/agony/reviews/2005/stross-accelerando.htm | title = Stross Accelerando | publisher = Trashotron | accessdate = 2011-04-23 | format = review | year = 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Singularity Sky"&gt;{{citation | last = Stross | first = Charles | date = 2010-04-01 | url = http://heliologue.com/2010/04/01/singularity-sky/ | title = Singularity Sky – A Modest Construct | publisher = Heliologue | accessdate = 2011-04-23}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for International Law of Peace and Armed Conflict''' (IFHV) at [[Ruhr University Bochum]] (Germany) is one of the leading research institutes on [[humanitarian law]] and [[humanitarian studies]] in Europe.

It was founded in 1988 on the initiative of Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. Knut Ipsen, then rector of Ruhr University Bochum, as a means to conduct research on international conflicts and provide solutions to resolve them. The IFHV’s research is highly interdisciplinary with a focus on international humanitarian studies from a legal and social-scientific perspective.

The Institute also provides high-level academic and professional training for the next generation of personnel in the area of humanitarian action. The IFHV’s interdisciplinary angle is put into practice through its Joint Master’s Programme in International Humanitarian Action, part of the [[European University Network on Humanitarian Assistance]] (NOHA).

Since 2014, the Institute is headed by Prof. Dr. Pierre Thielbörger, M.PP. ([[Harvard]]). Its staff consists of about 25 employees (including student research assistants) and about 10 PhD students.

Current professors involved in the Institute’s work are: 
* Prof. Dr. Dennis Dijkzeul (IFHV)
* Prof. Dr. Horst Fischer (IFHV)
* Prof. Dr. Hans-Joachim Heintze (IFHV)
* Prof. Dr. Pierre Thielbörger, M.PP. (Harvard) (IFHV &amp; Faculty of [[Law]]; Managing Director)
* Prof. Dr. Markus Kaltenborn (Faculty of Law)
* Prof. Dr. Adelheid Puttler, LL.M. ([[University of Chicago|Chicago]]) (Faculty of Law)
* Prof. Dr. Ludger Pries (Faculty of [[Social Science]])
* Prof. Dr. Stefan Wohnlich (Faculty of [[Geosciences]]) 
* Prof. Dr. Michael Wilhelm (Faculty of [[Medicine]])

==Research==

The Institute’s research programme is based on four pillars:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ifhv/2-research/2-index.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Extensive research projects, often leading to major academic publications
# Research seminars, conferences and summer schools
# Postdoctoral research
# Doctoral research

Some significant current and former research areas include 
* questions of international and non-international [[armed conflicts]]
* the [[right to water]] in relation to armed conflicts
* [[climate change]] and [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian action]]
* questions of [[minority rights]] and [[self-determination]] 
* problems of humanitarian operations conducted by [[international organisations]]

==NOHA Master==

The European University Network on Humanitarian Assistance (NOHA) is an international association of universities that aims at enhancing professionalism in the humanitarian sector, by promoting humanitarian values through higher education. Its flagship Joint Master’s Programme in International Humanitarian Action was created in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nohanet.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=105&amp;Itemid=650&amp;lang=en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121145159/http://www.nohanet.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=105&amp;Itemid=650&amp;lang=en |archivedate=2015-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its European partner universities are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nohanet.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=102&amp;Itemid=663&amp;lang=en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121144835/http://www.nohanet.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=102&amp;Itemid=663&amp;lang=en |archivedate=2015-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

The Institute maintains a significant range of different publication series in [[international law]] in order to provide information about long-term subjects as well as contemporary issues.

===Journal of International Law of Peace and Armed Conflict (JILPAC)===

The [[Journal of International Law of Peace and Armed Conflict]] is the leading German journal for research on [[international humanitarian law]], [[human rights]] and [[peacekeeping]] law. It is published quarterly by the Institute in cooperation with the German Red Cross.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ifhv/6-publications/6-huvi-index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bochumer Faxe (‘Bofaxe’)===

[[Bofaxe]] deal with current events related to international humanitarian law. Usually making up not more than one page, Bofaxe are an instrument to provide comprised analysis on pressing matters of international concern.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ifhv/6-publications/6-bofaxe.html&lt;/ref&gt; They are an opportunity for acclaimed experts as well as younger legal researchers to share their views on events shaping the world.

===IFHV Working Papers===

Since 2010, the IFHV and the Ruhr University Bochum regularly release the [[IFHV Working Papers]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ifhv/6-publications/6-workingpapers.html&lt;/ref&gt; It offers researchers the opportunity to bring their academic work on humanitarian issues to the attention of a broader audience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2995">'''IPI''' (''Interested party information'') is a unique identifying number assigned by the [[Confédération Internationale des Sociétés d´Auteurs et Compositeurs|CISAC]] database to each ''Interested Party'' in [[collective rights management]]. It is used worldwide by more than 120 countries and three million right holders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisac.org/What-We-Do/Information-Services/IPI Confédération Internationale des Sociétés d´Auteurs et Compositeurs - IPI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two type of IPI-numbers exist:&lt;ref&gt;https://cwr-dataapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/other/ipi_number.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==IPI Name Number==
The IP Name Number is the code for a name or pseudonym related to an entity (natural person or a legal entity). One entity can have several names. [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] for example has the IPI-codes
00045620792 (Nelson Prince Rogers), 00052210040 (Prince) and 00334284961 (Nelson Prince R).

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bic.org.uk/files/pdfs/namenumbers.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The IPI Name Number is composed of eleven numeric digits.

==IPI Base Number==
The IPI Base Number is the code for a natural person or a legal entity. It has the pattern H-NNNNNNNNN-C.
* H: header (a single letter)
* N: identification number (nine numeric digits)
* C: [[check digit]] (a single number)

For example [[Pablo Picasso]] has the IP Base Number I-001068130-6.

==History==
In October 2001, the IPI database replaced the [[CAE number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisac.org/web%5Ccontent.nsf/Popup?ReadForm&amp;Page=Article&amp;Lang=EN&amp;Alias=ACT-CIS-POP-02] {{dead link|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation with ISWC-numbers==
IPI codes are connected with [[International Standard Musical Work Code]]s (ISWC). For example, one of the songs called ''Ernie'', which has an [[International Standard Musical Work Code|ISWC]] number of T-010.171.314-7, has just one interested party, that of [[Benny Hill]] whose IPI number is 00014107338. This IPI number can then be used to find all other works by him.

===Roles===
In relation to ISWC each party has at least one role. Roles can be:&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.cisac.org/CisacPortal/cisacDownloadFile.do?docId=22243 CISAC AVIndex and AVR Lookup Table] p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The standards describe the person who adapts music as an arranger, and the person who adapts the text of a musical work to be an adapter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/iso/tc46sc9/docs/sc9n298.pdf Report of Voting on ISO Draft International Standard 15707 (International Standard Musical Work Code)], [[National Library of Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="941">'''Invited error''' refers to a trial court's [[error (law)|error]] against which a party cannot complain to an [[appellate court]] because the party encouraged or prompted the error by its own conduct during the trial. The original goal of the invited error doctrine was to prohibit a party from setting up an error at trial and then complaining of it on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;''State v. Pam'', 101 Wn.2d 507, 680 P.2d 762 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''State v. Pam'', the State of Washington intentionally set up an error in order to create a [[test case]] for appeal.  Since then, the doctrine has been applied even in cases where the error resulted from neither negligence nor bad faith.  See, e.g., {{cite court|litigants=State v. Studd|vol=137|court=Wn.2d|opinion=533|pinpoint=547|date=1999}}

[[Blasphemy]] in [[Islam]] is impious utterance or action concerning [[God in Islam|God]],  "Blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad and his companions (sabb al-rasul, sabb al-sahabah)"&lt;ref&gt;The introduction of the topic into shafi'i legal literature and its relevance for legal practice under Mamluk rule".

''Blasphemy against the Prophet, in Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture'' (editors: Coeli Fitzpatrick and Adam Hani Walker). {{ISBN|978-1610691772}}, pp. 59–67.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been argued that the death penalty applies only to cases where there is [[Treason#Muslim countries|treason]] involved that may seriously harm the [[Muslim]] community, especially during times of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iiit.org/iiitftp/publications/Bibs/Books-in-Brief%20Apostasy%20in%20Islam%20A%20Historical%20and%20Scriptural%20Analysis.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219032457/http://iiit.org/iiitftp/publications/Bibs/Books-in-Brief%20Apostasy%20in%20Islam%20A%20Historical%20and%20Scriptural%20Analysis.pdf |archivedate=19 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different traditional [[Madhhab|schools of jurisprudence]] prescribe different punishment for blasphemy, depending on whether the blasphemer is Muslim or non-Muslim, a man or a woman.{{sfn|Saeed|2004|p. 38–39}} In the modern [[Muslim world]], the laws pertaining to blasphemy [[Blasphemy law|vary by country]], and some countries prescribe punishments consisting of fines, imprisonment, [[Zanjeer zani|flogging]], [[hanging]], or [[Beheading in Islam|beheading]].&lt;ref name=psns&gt;P Smith (2003).

==Islamic scriptures==

In Islamic literature, blasphemy is of many types, and there are many different words for it: ''sabb'' (insult) and ''shatm'' (abuse, vilification), ''takdhib'' or ''tajdif'' (denial), ''iftira'' (concoction), ''la`n'' or ''la'ana'' (curse) and ''ta`n'' (accuse, defame).&lt;ref&gt;See:

''Iranian Studies'' '''37'''(1). pp. 47–71.&lt;/ref&gt; In Islamic literature, the term "blasphemy" sometimes also overlaps with ''[[Kafir|kufr]]'' ("unbelief"), ''fisq'' (depravity), ''isa'ah'' (insult), and ''ridda'' (apostasy).&lt;ref&gt;Talal Asad, in Hent de Vries (ed.).

Not only does the Quran not prescribe any earthly punishment for blasphemy, it actually advocates a non-violent response.&lt;ref&gt;Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty, Mustafa Akyol, 2013 p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam, 2004 pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; The commanded response is only to "not sit with" those who mock the religion. For example:

{{quote|When you hear God’s revelations disbelieved in and mocked at, do not sit with them until they enter into some other discourse; surely then you would be like them.|[[Qur'an]]|{{quran-usc|4|140}}||}} 

But a variety of punishments, including death, have been instituted in Islamic Jurisprudence, that draw their sources from hadith literature &lt;ref&gt;Siraj Khan. Blasphemy against the Prophet, in Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture (editors: Coeli Fitzpatrick and Adam Hani Walker). {{ISBN|978-1610691772}}, pp. 59–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam, 2004 pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hadiths===
Sources in hadith literature allege that [[Muhammad]] ordered the execution of [[Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf]].&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Uri. ''The Assassination of Kaʿb b. al-Ashraf.'' Oriens, Vol. 32. (1990), pp. 65–71.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Battle of Badr]], Ka'b had incited the Quraysh against Muhammad, and also urged them to seek vengeance against Muslims. Another person executed was Abu Rafi', who had actively propagandized against Muslims immediately before the [[Battle of Ahzab]]. Both of these men were guilty of insulting Muhammad, and both were guilty of inciting violence. While some{{Who?|date=April 2017}} have explained that these two men were executed for blaspheming against Muhammad, an alternative explanation{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} is that they were executed for treason and causing disorder (''[[fasad]]'') in society.&lt;ref&gt;Siraj Khan (2014), "Blasphemy against the Prophet," ''Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Prophet of God'', (vol. 1 pp. 62). [[ABC-CLIO]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One hadith{{Which?|date=April 2017}} tells of a man who killed his slave because she persisted in insulting Muhammad. Upon hearing this, Muhammad is reported to have exclaimed: "Do you not bear witness that her blood is futile!" (''anna damah hadarun'')&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Abudawud|38|4348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=khan/&gt; This expression can be read as meaning that the killing was unnecessary, implying that Muhammad condemned it.&lt;ref name=khan/&gt; However, most hadith specialists interpreted it as voiding the obligation of paying the blood money which would normally be due to the woman's next of kin.&lt;ref name=khan/&gt; Another hadith reports Muhammad using an expression which clearly indicates the latter meaning: &lt;ref name=khan/&gt;

==Punishment==

===Traditional jurisprudence===
{{Fiqh |criminal}}
The [[Quran]] does not explicitly mention any worldly punishment for blasphemy (''sabb allah'' or ''sabb al-rasul''). Islamic jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]) of Sunni and Shia [[madhab]]s have declared different punishments for the religious crime of blasphemy, and they vary between schools. These are as follows:&lt;ref name = "Saeed"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Saeed  | first = Abdullah  |author2=Hassan Saeed  | title = Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam  | publisher = Ashgate Publishing Company  | year = 2004  | location = Burlington VT  | pages = 37–39  | isbn = 978-0-7546-3083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiederhold, Lutz.

He must repent, or else is killed. And this is the same for the woman, except Abu Hanifa said: Do not kill the woman, but coerce her back to Islam.”&lt;/ref&gt; If a non-Muslim commits blasphemy, his punishment must be a [[tazir]] (discretionary, can be death, arrest, caning, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tahawi (933), Mukhtasar Ikhtilaf al-Ulama, vol. 3, p. 504&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.

Some jurists suggest that the sunnah in {{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Bukhari|3|45|687}} and {{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Bukhari|5|59|369}} provide a basis for a death sentence for the crime of blasphemy, even if someone claims not to be an apostate, but has committed the crime of blasphemy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Some modern Muslim scholars contest that Islam supports [[blasphemy law]], stating that [[Ulama|Muslim jurists]] made the offense part of [[Sharia]].&lt;ref&gt;Declan O'Sullivan (2001), The Interpretation of Qur'anic Text to Promote or Negate the Death Penalty for Apostates and Blasphemers, Journal of Qur'anic Studies, 3(2), pp. 63–93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/20/islam-ghamidi-pakistan-blasphemy-laws Islamic scholar attacks Pakistan's blasphemy laws] Guardian 20 January 2010.

The Islamic law considers blasphemy against Muhammad a more severe offense than blasphemy against God. Repentance can lead to forgiveness by God when God is blasphemed, however since Muhammad is no longer alive, forgiveness is not possible when Muhammad is blasphemed, and the Muslim community must punish his blasphemy by avenging blasphemer's death.&lt;ref name = "Saeed"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, David A.

A convicted blasphemer may, among other penalties, lose all legal rights. The loss of rights may cause a blasphemer's marriage to be dissolved, religious acts to be rendered worthless, and claims to property—including any inheritance—to be rendered void. Repentance, in some Fiqhs, may restore lost rights except for marital rights; lost marital rights are regained only by remarriage. Women have blasphemed and repented to end a marriage. Muslim women may be permitted to repent, and may receive a lesser punishment than would befall a Muslim man who committed the same offense.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Religion"/&gt; Most Muslim-majority countries have some form of blasphemy law and some of them have been compared to blasphemy laws in European countries (Britain, Germany, Finland etc.).&lt;ref name="Böwering"/&gt; However, in five countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, blasphemy is punishable by execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OcriBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83 |page= 83 |title= Political Secularism, Religion, and the State: A Time Series Analysis of Worldwide Data |author= Jonathan Fox |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pakistan, more than a thousand people have been convicted of blasphemy since the 1980s; though none have been executed.&lt;ref name="Böwering"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=q1I0pcrFFSUC&amp;pg=PA72 |page=72 |title= The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought |editors= Gerhard Böwering, Patricia Crone, Mahan Mirza |publisher= Princeton University Press |year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blasphemy as apostasy==
{{Main|Apostasy in Islam}}
Blasphemy has historically been seen as an evidence of rejection of Islam, that is, the religious crime of [[apostasy]]. Some jurists believe that blasphemy automatically implies a Muslim has left the fold of Islam.{{sfn|Saeed|2004|p. 38–39}} A Muslim may find himself accused of being a blasphemer, and thus an apostate on the basis of one action or utterance.{{sfn|Saeed|2004|p.48}}&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Religion"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title = Blasphemy: Islamic Concept |encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Religion |volume = 2 |pages = 974–76 |publisher = Thomson Gale |location = Farmington Hills, MI |year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Islamic sources [[Nadr ibn al-Harith]], who was an Arab Pagan doctor from Taif, used to tell stories of [[Esfandiyār|Rustam and Isfandiyar]] to the Arabs and scoffed Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=js30HODt2aYC&amp;pg=PA179 Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century, Volume 2, Part 2], p. 179, Irfan Shahîd.

According to certain hadiths, after Mecca's fall [[Muhammad]] ordered a number of enemies executed. Based on this early jurists postulated that ''sabb al-Nabi'' (abuse of the Prophet) was a crime "so heinous that repentance was disallowed and summary execution was required".&lt;ref name=kadri-252&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ...|date=2012|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780099523277|page=252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&amp;q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&amp;f=false|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sadakat Kadri]] writes that the actual prosecutions for blasphemy in the Muslim historical record "are vanishingly infrequent". One of the "few known cases" was that of a Christian accused of insulting the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. It ended in an acquittal in 1293, though it was followed by a protest against a decision led by the famed and strict jurist [[Ibn Taymiyya]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel, ''Muslim Theologian's Response'', pp. 69–71)&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades [[Islamic revival]]ists have called for its enforcement on the grounds that criminalizing hostility toward Islam will safeguard communal cohesion.&lt;ref name=kadri-252/&gt; In one country where strict laws on blaspheme were introduced in the 1980s, [[Blasphemy law in Pakistan|Pakistan]], over 1300 people have been accused of blasphemy from 1987 to 2014, (mostly non-Muslim religious minorities),  mostly for allegedly [[Quran desecration|desecrating]] the [[Quran]].&lt;ref name=bbc-blasphem&gt;{{cite web|title=What are Pakistan's blasphemy laws?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-12621225|website=BBC News|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 50 people accused of blasphemy have been murdered before their respective trials were over,&lt;ref name=dawn-08182013&gt;{{cite news|title=Timeline: Accused under the Blasphemy Law|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/750512/timeline-accused-under-the-blasphemy-law|accessdate=10 December 2014|agency=Dawn.com|date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aljazeera&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hashim|first1=Asad|title=Living in fear under Pakistan's blasphemy law|journal=Al Jazeera|date=17 May 2014|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/05/living-fear-under-pakistan-blasphemy-law-20145179369144891.html|accessdate=21 November 2014|quote=In Pakistan, 17 people are on death row for blasphemy, and dozens more have been extrajudicially murdered.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prominent figures who opposed blasphemy laws ([[Salman Taseer]], the former governor of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], and [[Shahbaz Bhatti]], the Federal Minister for Minorities) have been assassinated.&lt;ref name=bbc-blasphem/&gt;

New York: Oxford University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, several Islamic nations have argued in the United Nations that blasphemy against Muhammad is unacceptable, and that laws should be passed worldwide to proscribe it. In September 2012, the [[Organisation of Islamic Conference]] (OIC), who has sought for a universal blasphemy law over a decade, revived these attempts. Separately, the Human Rights Commission of the OIC called for "an international code of conduct for media and social media to disallow the dissemination of incitement material". Non-Muslim nations that do not have blasphemy laws, have pointed to abuses of blasphemy laws in Islamic nations, and have disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/radical-islam’s-global-reaction-push-blasphemy-laws Michael Totten, Radical Islam's global reaction: the push for blasphemy laws (January/February 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/19/us-protests-religions-blasphemy-idUSBRE88I1EG20120919|title=Islamic states to reopen quest for global blasphemy law|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/Blasphemy_Cases.pdf|format=PDF|title=Blasphemy Laws Exposed – The Consequences of Criminalizing Defamation of Religions |year=2012|website=humanrightsfirst.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding, controversies raised in the non-Muslim world, especially over depictions of [[Muhammad]], questionning issues relating to the [[religious offense]] to minorities in secular countries. A key case was the 1989 fatwa against English author [[Salman Rushdie]] for his 1988 book entitled ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', the title of which refers to an account that Muhammad, in the course of revealing the Quran, [[Satanic Verses|received a revelation from Satan and incorporated it therein]] until made by Allah to retract it. Several translators of his book into foreign languages have been murdered.&lt;ref name="Rushdie"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blasphemy Salman Rushdie |publisher=Constitutional Rights Foundation |year=2009 |url=http://www.crf-usa.org/america-responds-to-terrorism/blasphemy-salman-rushdie.html |accessdate=10 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818052403/http://www.crf-usa.org/america-responds-to-terrorism/blasphemy-salman-rushdie.html |archivedate=18 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, many supporters of Salman Rushdie and his publishers advocated unrestricted freedom of expression and the abolition of the [[Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom|British blasphemy laws]]. As a response, [[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]] wrote ''[[A Brief History of Blasphemy]]'' in which he discussed freedom to publish books that may cause distress to minorities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 1994, Hadi Al-Mutif a teenager who was a Shi’a Ismaili Muslim from [[Najran]] in southwestern [[Saudi Arabia]], made a remark that a court deemed blasphemous and was sentenced to death for apostasy. {{as of|2010}}, he was still in prison, had alleged physical abuse and mistreatment during his years of incarceration, and had reportedly made numerous suicide attempts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscirf.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3027&amp;Itemid=1 3/25/2010: Saudi Arabia: Release Hadi Al-Mutif], March 25, 2010, United States Commission on International Religious Freedom.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freedomofapostasy.wordpress.com/crimes-against-humanity/ Freedom of Apostasy : The Victims].&lt;/ref&gt;

The court sentenced Ahmad to ten years in prison and six lashes from a rattan cane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Malaysia court sentences Muslim sect leader to 10 years in jail, caning over false teachings |publisher = 3news.co.nz |date = 21 October 2009 |url = http://www.3news.co.nz/Malaysia-court-sentences-Muslim-sect-leader-to-10-years-in-jail-caning-over-false-teachings/tabid/209/articleID/126395/Default.aspx?ArticleID=126395 |accessdate = 15 November 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120905151522/http://www.3news.co.nz/Malaysia-court-sentences-Muslim-sect-leader-to-10-years-in-jail-caning-over-false-teachings/tabid/209/articleID/126395/Default.aspx?ArticleID=126395 |archive-date = 5 September 2012 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, Bangladeshi cartoonist [[Arifur Rahman]] depicted in the daily ''[[Prothom Alo]]'' a boy holding a cat conversing with an elderly man. The man asks the boy his name, and he replies "Babu". The older man chides him for not mentioning the name of Muhammad before his name. He then points to the cat and asks the boy what it is called, and the boy replies "Muhammad the cat". Bangladesh does not have a blasphemy law but groups said the cartoon ridiculed Muhammad, torched copies of the paper and demanded that Rahman be executed for blasphemy. As a result, Bangladeshi police detained Rahman and confiscated copies of ''Prothom Alo'' in which the cartoon appeared.

The [[Asia Bibi blasphemy case]] involved a [[Christianity in Pakistan|Pakistani Christian]] woman, Aasiya Noreen (born {{circa}} 1971;&lt;ref name="kazim"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/0,1518,729847,00.html|title=Eine Ziege, ein Streit und ein Todesurteil|last=Kazim|first=Hasnain|date=19 November 2010|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|language=German|trans-title=A goat, a fight and a death sentence|accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; better known as Asia Bibi&lt;ref name="fears"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11923701|title=Fear for Pakistan's death row Christian woman|last=|first=|date=5 December 2010|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=5 December 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206045829/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11923701|archivedate=6 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; convicted of [[Blasphemy law in Pakistan|blasphemy by a Pakistani court]], receiving a sentence of death by [[hanging]] in 2010. In June 2009, Noreen was involved in an argument with a group of Muslim women with whom she had been harvesting berries after the other women grew angry with her for drinking the same water as them. She was subsequently accused of insulting the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], a charge she denies, and was arrested and imprisoned. In November 2010, a [[Sheikhupura]] judge sentenced her to death. If executed, Noreen would be the first woman in Pakistan to be lawfully killed for blasphemy.&lt;ref name=aps&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101111/wl_sthasia_afp/pakistanunrestreligionchristian |first=Waqar |last=Hussain |title=Christian Woman Sentenced to Death|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=11 November 2010|accessdate=11 November 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114071047/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101111/wl_sthasia_afp/pakistanunrestreligionchristian| archivedate=14 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tele&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/8120142/Christian-woman-sentenced-to-death-in-Pakistan-for-blasphemy.html |first1=Rob |last1=Crilly |first2=Aoun |last2=Sahi |title=Christian Woman sentenced to Death in Pakistan for blasphemy |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=9 November 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2010 |location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101111174909/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/8120142/Christian-woman-sentenced-to-death-in-Pakistan-for-blasphemy.html| archivedate=11 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verdict, which was reached in a district court and would need to be upheld by a superior court, has received worldwide attention. Various petitions, including one that received 400,000 signatures, were organized to protest Noreen's imprisonment, and [[Pope Benedict XVI]] publicly called for the charges against her to be dismissed. She received less sympathy from her neighbors and Islamic religious leaders in the country, some of whom adamantly called for her to be executed. Christian minorities minister [[Shahbaz Bhatti]] and Muslim politician [[Salmaan Taseer]] were both assassinated for advocating on her behalf and opposing the blasphemy laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/02/us-pakistan-assassination-idUSTRE7211GH20110302 | work=Reuters | title=Militants say killed Pakistani minister for blasphemy | date=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noreen's family went into hiding after receiving death threats, some of which threatened to kill Asia if released from prison.&lt;ref name=price&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11930849 | title = Pakistani Christian Asia Bibi 'has price on her head' | last = Guerin  | first = Orla |date = 6 December 2010 | work = [[BBC]] | accessdate = 6 December 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101207044430/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11930849| archivedate= 7 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Governor [[Salmaan Taseer]] and Pakistan's Minority Affairs Minister [[Shahbaz Bhatti]] both publicly supported Noreen, with the latter saying, "I will go to every knock for justice on her behalf and I will take all steps for her protection."&lt;ref name=price/&gt; She also received support from Pakistani political scientist [[Rasul Baksh Rais]] and local priest Samson Dilawar.&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Julie|title=Christian's Death Verdict Spurs Holy Row In Pakistan|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/12/14/132031645/christian-s-death-verdict-spurs-holy-row-in-pakistan|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=27 November 2013|date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The imprisonment of Noreen left Christians and other minorities in Pakistan feeling vulnerable, and [[liberal Muslims]] were also unnerved by her sentencing.&lt;ref name=Ind&gt;{{cite news|title='Salmaan Taseer came here and he sacrificed his life for me'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/salmaan-taseer-came-here-and-he-sacrificed-his-life-for-me-2179170.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=27 November 2012|date=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minority Affairs Minister [[Shahbaz Bhatti]] said that he was first threatened with death in June 2010 when he was told that he would be beheaded if he attempted to change the blasphemy laws. In response, he told reporters that he was "committed to the principle of justice for the people of Pakistan" and willing to die fighting for Noreen's release.&lt;ref name=price/&gt; On 2 March 2011, Bhatti was shot dead by gunmen who ambushed his car near his residence in Islamabad, presumably because of his position on the blasphemy laws.

In January 2011, talking about the Asia Bibi blasphemy case, Pakistani politician Salmaan Taseer expressed views opposing the country's blasphemy law and supporting Asia Bibi. He was then killed by one of his bodyguards, Malik Mumtaz Qadri. After the murder, hundreds of clerics voiced support for the crime and urged a general boycott of Taseer's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;R.

====Protests against depicting Muhammad====
[[File:Maome.jpg|thumb|260px|A 17th century copy of a 14th-century Persian manuscript image of [[Muhammad]] prohibiting [[Nasi']], one of the [[depictions of Muhammad]] which raised objections]]

In December 1999, the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' printed on the same page pictures of “moral apostles” Muhammad, [[Jesus]], [[Confucius]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Few weeks later, the magazine received protests, petitions and threats against publishing [[depictions of Muhammad]]. The Turkish TV-station [[Show TV]] broadcast the telephone number of an editor who then received daily calls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-15613871.html Terror am Telefon], ''Spiegel'', February 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; A picture of Muhammad had been published by the magazine once before in 1998 in a special edition on Islam, without evoking similar protests.&lt;ref&gt;''Spiegel Special'' 1, 1998, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, several Muslims protested against the inclusion of Muhammad's depictions in the [[English Wikipedia]]'s ''Muhammad'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,328966,00.html |title=Muslims Protest Wikipedia Images of Muhammad |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=2008-02-06 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/books/05wiki.html |title=Wikipedia Islam Entry Is Criticized |author=Noam Cohen |publisher=New York Times |date=2008-02-05 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online petition opposed a reproduction of a 17th-century Ottoman copy of a 14th-century [[Ilkhanate]] manuscript image depicting Muhammad as he prohibited [[Nasīʾ]].&lt;ref&gt;MS Arabe 1489.

====The Muhammad cartoons crisis====
{{Muhammad cartoons}}

In September 2005, in the tense aftermath of the assassination of Dutch film director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], killed for his views on Islam, Danish news service [[Ritzau]] published an article discussing the difficulty encountered by the writer [[Kåre Bluitgen]] to find an illustrator to work on his children's book ''The Qur'an and the life of the Prophet Muhammad'' (Danish:''Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv'').&lt;ref name="hansen&amp;hundevadt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=John|title=Provoen og Profeten: Muhammed Krisen bag kulisserne|year=2006|publisher=Jyllands-Postens Forlag|location=Copenhagen|isbn=87-7692-092-5|first2=Kim |last2=Hundevadt|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bluitgen|first=Kåre|title=Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv|year=2006|publisher=Høst &amp; Søn/Tøkk|isbn=978-87-638-0049-5|page=268|url=http://www.digibutik.dk/?ID=250&amp;GroupID=250&amp;ProductID=PROD1179&amp;pgid=GROUP249&amp;qq=8D7SR65SK7TUB%2048D9LG6B%20L7T|others=Anonymous illustrator|language=Danish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118123641/http://www.digibutik.dk/?ID=250&amp;GroupID=250&amp;ProductID=PROD1179&amp;pgid=GROUP249&amp;qq=8D7SR65SK7TUB%2048D9LG6B%20L7T|archivedate=18 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that three artists declined his proposal, which was interpreted as evidence of self-censorship out of fear of reprisals, which led to much debate in Denmark.&lt;ref name="dybangst"&gt;{{cite news|date=17 September 2005|title=Dyb angst for kritik af islam ("Profound anxiety about criticism of Islam")|newspaper=Politiken|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/boger/ECE123660/dyb-angst-for-kritik-af-islam/|accessdate=19 March 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whyipub"&gt;{{cite news|date=19 February 2006|title=Why I Published Those Cartoons |newspaper=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/17/AR2006021702499.html|first=Flemming|last=Rose|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the experiment, Danish scholar [[Peter Hervik]] wrote that it disproved the idea that self-censorship was a serious problem in Denmark, because the overwhelming majority of cartoonists had either responded positively or refused for contractual or philosophical reasons.&lt;ref name=IMER&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hervik|first=Peter|title=The Danish Muhammad Cartoon Conflict|journal=Current Themes in IMER Research|year=2012|volume=13|url=http://www.mah.se/upload/Forskningscentrum/MIM/CT/CT%2013.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2012|publisher=Malmö Institute for Studies of Migration, Diversity and Welfare (MIM)|issn=1652-4616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Danish newspaper ''Politiken'' stated that they asked Bluitgen to put them in touch with the artists who reportedly declined his proposal, so his claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved, but that Bluitgen refused, making his initial claim impossible to confirm.&lt;ref&gt;Politiken 12. Februar 2006 "''Muhammedsag: Ikke ligefrem en genistreg''"&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Flemming Rose]], an editor at the [[List of newspapers in Denmark|Danish newspaper]] ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'', invited professional illustrators to depict Muhammad as an experiment to see how much they felt threatened. The newspaper announced that this was an attempt to contribute to the debate about [[criticism of Islam]] and self-censorship. On 30 September 2005, the ''Jyllands-Posten'' published 12 editorial cartoons, most of which depicted the prophet Muhammad. One cartoon by [[Kurt Westergaard]] depicted Muhammad with a bomb in his turban, which resulted in the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]] (or Muhammad cartoons crisis) ([[Denmark|Danish]]: ''Muhammedkrisen'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henkel|first=Heiko|title=Fundamentally Danish?

"Those who have won are dictatorships in the Middle East, in Saudi Arabia, where they cut criminals' hands and give women no rights," Juste told The Associated Press. "The dark dictatorships have won."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cartoon-inflames-muslim-world/|title=Cartoon Inflames Muslim World|author=LLOYD VRIES|date=2 Feb 2006|work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting the cartoon that initiated the diplomatic crisis, American scholar [[John E. Woods (historian)|John Woods]] expressed worries about Westergaard-like association of the Prophet with terrorism, that was beyond satire and offensive to a vast majority of Muslims.&lt;ref name=explaining&gt;{{cite news|title=Explaining the outrage|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-02-08/news/0602080383_1_prophet-muhammad-cartoons-muslims|date=2006-02-08|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hervik also deplored that the newspaper's "desire to provoke and insult Danish Muslims exceeded the wish to test the self-censorship of Danish cartoonists."&lt;ref name=IMER/&gt; 

In Sweden, an online caricature competition was announced in support of ''Jyllands-Posten'', but foreign minister [[Laila Freivalds]] pressured the provider to shut the page down (in 2006, her involvement was revealed to the public and she had to resign).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L21470789.htm |title=Swedish foreign minister resigns over cartoons |work=Reuters AlertNet |accessdate=2006-03-21 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060322184626/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L21470789.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 22 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, satirical magazine ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' republished the ''Jyllands-Posten'' cartoons of Muhammad. It was taken to court by Islamic organisations under [[Hate speech laws in France|French hate speech laws]]; it was ultimately acquitted of charges that it incited hatred.&lt;ref name="Leveque1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leveque|first=Thierry|title=French court clears weekly in Mohammad cartoon row|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/03/22/industry-france-cartoons-trial-dc-idUSL2212067120070322|accessdate=10 June 2013|agency=Reuters|date=22 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leveque"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leveque|first=Thierry|title=French court clears weekly in Mohammad cartoon row|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/03/22/industry-france-cartoons-trial-dc-idUSL2212067120070322|accessdate=10 June 2013|publisher=Reuters|date=22 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, art galleries in Sweden declined to show drawings of artist [[Lars Vilks]] depicting Muhammad as a [[roundabout dog]]. While Swedish newspapers had published them already, the drawings gained international attention after the newspaper ''[[Nerikes Allehanda]]'' published one of them on August 18 to illustrate an editorial on the "right to ridicule a religion".&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=Rätten att förlöjliga en religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-08-18 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070906190721/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-06}}&lt;br/&gt;English translation: {{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=The right to ridicule a religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070830163657/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular publication led to official condemnations from Iran,&lt;ref name=iran&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran protests over Swedish Muhammad cartoon |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8305/20070827/ |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-08-27 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829141345/http://www.thelocal.se/8305/20070827/ |archivedate=29 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan,&lt;ref name=pakistan&gt;{{cite press release|title=Pakistan Condemns the Publication of Offensive Sketch in Sweden |publisher=[[Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |date=2007-08-30 |url=http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Press_Releases/2007/Aug/PR_234_07.htm |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904154021/http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Press_Releases/2007/Aug/PR_234_07.htm |archivedate=4 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan,&lt;ref name=afghanistan&gt;{{cite news |first=Sayed |last=Salahuddin |title=Indignant Afghanistan slams Prophet Mohammad sketch |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/SouthAsiaNews/idINIndia-29281220070901 |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-09-01 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt&lt;ref name=egypt&gt;{{cite news |first=Gwladys |last=Fouché |title=Egypt wades into Swedish cartoons row |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,,2161595,00.html |publisher=The Guardian |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jordan,&lt;ref name=jordan&gt;{{cite news |title=Jordan condemns new Swedish Mohammed cartoon |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070903/wl_mideast_afp/jordanswedenislam_070903124623 |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2007-09-09}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the inter-governmental Organisation of the Islamic Conference.&lt;ref name=oic&gt;{{cite press release|title=The Secretary General strongly condemned the publishing of blasphemous caricatures of prophet Muhammad by Swedish artist |publisher=[[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] |date=2007-08-30 |url=http://www.oic-oci.org/press/English/2007/08/caricatur.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012054243/http://oic-oci.org/press/English/2007/08/caricatur.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2007-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the American comedy program ''[[South Park]]'', which had previously depicted Muhammad as a superhero ("[[Super Best Friends]])"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Super Best Friends | episodelink = Super Best Friends | series = South Park | serieslink = South Park | airdate = 2001-07-04 | season = 5 | number = 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has depicted Muhammad in the opening sequence since then,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/04/15/south-parks-been-showing-muhammad-all-season/ |title=Ryan j Budke.

They intended to show Muhammad handing a salmon helmet to ''[[Family Guy]]'' character [[Peter Griffin]] ("[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]"). However, [[Comedy Central]] who airs the series rejected the scene and its creators reacted by satirizing [[double standard]] for broadcast acceptability. In April 2010, animators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] planned to make episodes satirizing controversies over previous episodes, including Comedy Central's refusal to show images of Muhammad following the 2005 Danish controversy. After they faced Internet death threats, Comedy Central modified their version of the episode, obscuring all images and bleeping all references to Muhammad. In reaction, cartoonist Molly Norris created the [[Everybody Draw Mohammed Day]], claiming that if many people draw pictures of Muhammad, threats to murder them all would become unrealistic. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Examples of blasphemy==
[[File:Salman-Rushdie-1.jpg|thumb|Writer [[Salman Rushdie]] was accused of blasphemy and became the subject of a ''[[fatwā]]'' issued by [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]], in February 1989.]]
A variety of actions, speeches or behavior can constitute blasphemy in Islam. Some examples include insulting or cursing Allah, or Muhammad; mockery or disagreeable behavior towards beliefs and customs common in Islam; criticism of Islam's holy personages. [[Apostasy in Islam|Apostasy]], that is, the act of abandoning Islam, or finding faults or expressing doubts about Allah (''ta'til'') and Qur'an, rejection of Muhammed or any of his teachings, or leaving the Muslim community to become an atheist is a form of blasphemy. Questioning religious opinions (fatwa) and normative Islamic views can also be construed as blasphemous. Improper dress, drawing offensive cartoons, tearing or burning holy literature of Islam, creating or using music or painting or video or novels to mock or criticize Muhammad are some examples of blasphemous acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicp.ca/islamic-lessons/english/youth/the-islamic-education-series-book-5/chapter-of-belief/lesson-13-the-types-of-blasphemy-and-blasphemers/ Association of Islamic Charitable Projects, ''The Types of Blasphemy'' (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawton, D.

Individuals have been accused of blasphemy or of insulting Islam for a variety of actions and words.

The '''Jews Relief Act 1858''', also called the Jewish Disabilities Bill, is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which removed previous barriers to Jews entering Parliament.&lt;ref name=enacted&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/21-22/49/contents/enacted "Jews Relief Act 1858"], as originally enacted&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]] there had been an unsuccessful attempt in 1830 to also allow Jews to sit in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1830/may/17/bill-for-removal-of-jewish-disabilities#S2V0024P0_18300517_HOC_59 "BILL FOR REMOVAL OF JEWISH DISABILITIES. "], HC Deb 17 May 1830 vol 24 cc784-814&lt;/ref&gt; The 1858 measure was the result of a long process which began with a bill introduced by the Whig leader [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]]  following the election of [[Lionel de Rothschild]] to the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London constituency]] in 1847. Rothschild could not take the seat without taking the Christian oath. The bill was supported by the future Conservative Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] but not by his party.

In 1848, the bill was approved by the House of Commons but was twice rejected by the [[House of Lords]] as was a new bill in 1851. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1852|1852 general election]], Rothschild was again elected but the next year the bill was again defeated in the upper house. Finally, in 1858, the House of Lords agreed to a proposal to allow each house to decide its own oath.

The bill allowed "any Person professing the Jewish Religion, [to] omit the Words 'and I make this Declaration upon the true Faith of a Christian{{'"}} in their oaths, but explicitly did not extend to allowing Jews to various high offices, and also stated that "it shall not be lawful for any Person professing the Jewish Religion, directly or indirectly, to advise Her Majesty ... touching or concerning ... any office or preferment in the Church of England or in the Church of Scotland."&lt;ref name=enacted /&gt;

Amendments in 1871, 1922, 1973, 1980 and 1986 removed all restrictions on Jews holding office except that they may not advise certain government officials on matters related to appointments in the [[Church of England]] or the [[Church of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Jews Relief Act 1858, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/21-22/49/introduction as amended], accessed Sept 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demjanjuk was born in [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukraine]], and during World War II was drafted into the Soviet Red Army, where he was captured by Germans as a Soviet [[prisoner of war]]. In 1952, he emigrated from [[West Germany]] to the United States and was granted citizenship in 1958, whereupon he formally [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] his name from "[[Ivan (name)|Ivan]]" to "John".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |agency=AP  |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2011/07/attorneys_for_john_demjanjuk_s.html |title=John Demjanjuk's lawyers seek his return to the US |publisher=Cleveland.com |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Sturcke |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/12/ivan-demjanjuk-timeline |title=Timeline: John Demjanjuk |location=UK |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 May 2009 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, he was [[Deportation|deported]] to [[Israel]] to stand trial for war crimes, after being identified by eleven [[Holocaust survivor]]s,&lt;ref name="Ynetnews12"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://http//www.ynetnews.com/articles/0%2C7340%2CL-4204048%2C00.html%2Bwho |title=Israeli judge: Demjanjuk was 'Ivan the Terrible' |work=Ynetnews Magazine |date=2012-03-17 |accessdate=26 March 2014 |first=Boaz |last=Fyler |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; many from Israel, as "[[Ivan the Terrible (Treblinka guard)|Ivan the Terrible]]",{{Sfn|Wagenaar|1989}} a guard at the [[Treblinka extermination camp]] in [[Nazi occupied Poland]]. Demjanjuk was accused of committing murder and acts of extraordinarily savage violence against camp prisoners during 1942–1943. He was convicted of having committed [[crimes against humanity]] and [[Capital punishment in Israel|sentenced to death]] in 1988, but the verdict was overturned by the [[Israeli Supreme Court]] in 1993, based on new evidence that cast [[reasonable doubt]] over the identity of "Ivan the Terrible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hedges |first=Chris |date=12 August 1993 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/12/world/israel-recommends-that-demjanjuk-be-released.html?scp=3&amp;sq=Demjanjuk%20&amp;st=cse |title=Israel recommends that Demjanjuk be released |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demjanjuk was nearly a decade younger than "Ivan the Terrible", who was believed to have been born around 1911. After the trial, in September 1993, Demjanjuk returned to his home in [[Ohio]]. In 1998, his citizenship was restored after a United States federal appeals court ruled that prosecutors had suppressed [[exculpatory evidence]] concerning his identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chu |first=Henry |date=18 March 2012 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-john-demjanjuk-20120318,0,5221093.story |title=John Demjanjuk dies at 91; convicted Nazi death camp guard |department=Obituaries |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, with new evidence, Demjanjuk was charged again, this time on the grounds that he had served as a guard named Ivan Demjanjuk at the [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]] and [[Majdanek]] camps in [[Nazi occupied Poland]] and at the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg]] camp in Germany; separate documents were found in archives from each respective camp.

==Background and Holocaust involvement==
Demjanjuk was born in Dubovi Makharyntsi,&lt;ref name=oblasts&gt;formerly [[Kiev Governorate]], presently [[Koziatyn]] district, [[Vinnytsia Oblast]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ukraine, a farming village, and grew up during the man-made famine called the [[Holodomor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Raab, Scott |date=19 March 2012 |url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/john-demjanjuk-dead-7455239#ixzz1t9fc3eo6 |title=John Demjanjuk: Things we are left to tend to think |magazine=Esquire |access-date=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Demjanjuk was convicted in 2011 his son claimed, in an e-mail to [[Associated Press]], "My dad is a survivor of the genocide famine in Ukraine."&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; When interviewed in late December 2009, residents of Dubovi Makharyntsi declared that Demjanjuk got along well with the [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Jewish families living nearby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thelocal.de/society/20091220-24059.html |title=Anger simmers in Demjanjuk's home village |newspaper=[[The Local]] |date=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before joining the Soviet army, Demjanjuk worked as a tractor driver on a Soviet collective farm. In 1941, after the German attack on [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)#Treatment of Polish citizens under Soviet occupation|Soviet-occupied Poland]], Demjanjuk was drafted into the [[Red Army]]. After a battle in Eastern Crimea he was captured and became a [[prisoner of war]] (POW) and was moved to a German concentration camp for Soviet Russian POWs. [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|See: Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Demjanjuk |series=Profile |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7998947.stm |accessdate=12 May 2011 |publisher=BBC News |date=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He survived the ordeal, and volunteered to be sent to the [[Trawniki concentration camp]] division utilized for the training of [[Trawnikis|Hiwi guards]] recruited from Soviet POWs, later allegedly serving in [[Majdanek]], [[Sobibor]], and [[Flossenbürg]] concentration camps, and during the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]. Demjanjuk claims that, in early 1945, he joined the [[Russian Liberation Army]] (Russian: Russkaya osvoboditel'naya armiya, Русская освободительная армия, abbreviated in Cyrillic as РОА, in Latin as ROA, also known as the Vlasov army), led by [[Andrey Vlasov]], which was organized by Nazi Germany to fight against the Soviet Red Army.&lt;ref name=rosen&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenbach |first=Marcel  |date=18 November 2008 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,591257,00.html |title=Sixty years later, alleged Nazi guard may stand trial |magazine=[[Der Spiegel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Soviet prisoners of war volunteered to serve under the Nazi command in order to get out of the POW camps, where 2.8&amp;nbsp;million Soviet POWs died through starvation, exposure, and summary execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gendercide.org/case_soviet.html |title=Gendercide Watch: Soviet prisoners-of-war |accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such non-German volunteers that served in Germany's foreign legions were referred to by the German command as [[European non-Germans in the German armed forces during World War II|Freiwillige]], the German word for volunteer, and also as Hilfswilliger, literally one willing to help, often shortened to [[Hiwi (volunteer)|Hiwi]], in auxiliary non-combat paramilitary and civilian capacities.  According to Allied general Lt. Gen. [[Władysław Anders]], by 1942, there were about a million such volunteers from the USSR alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Anders |first1=Wladyslaw |first2=Antonio |last2=Munoz |url=http://www.feldgrau.com/articles.php?ID=54 |title=Russian volunteers in the German Wehrmacht in WW&amp;nbsp;II |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demjanjuk, his wife and their child arrived in New York City aboard the {{USS|General W. G.

He and his wife, whom he met in a [[displaced person]]s' camp, moved to [[Indiana]] with their daughter and then to the [[Cleveland]] suburb of [[Seven Hills, Ohio|Seven Hills]]. He became a [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW) diesel engine mechanic at the nearby [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] automobile factory&lt;ref name="ClevelandJewishNews22032012" /&gt; where a friend from back in [[Regensburg]], [[Germany]], had found work.&lt;ref name= Douglas29 /&gt; Demjanjuk and his wife, who began work at a [[General Electric]] facility,&lt;ref name= Douglas29 /&gt; later had two more children.

In 1975, Michael Hanusiak, an editor of ''[[Ukrainian News]]'', presented a list of ethnic Ukrainians living in the United States suspected of collaborating with Germans in World War II to what was then the [[US Immigration and Naturalization Service]]; Demjanjuk's name was on that list.&lt;ref name= KP2032012Semotiuk&gt;{{cite news |author=Semotuik, Andrij A. |date=21 March 2012 |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/opinion/op_ed/detail/124648/ |title=In memory of John Demjanjuk |newspaper=Kyiv Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet newspapers and archives had provided the names during Hanusiak's visit to the Soviet Union in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Ukrainian Weekly |date=2 August 1987 |title=[no title cited] |quote=In 1975 Michael Hanusiak provided the INS with 73&amp;nbsp;names that he obtained from Soviet newspaper editors and archival sources while visiting the Soviet Union in 1974.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanusiak also handed over a purported copy of a Nazi ID card issued to Demjanjuk at [[Trawniki]].&lt;ref name=HM30112009Douglas/&gt;

In August 1977, the Justice Department submitted a request to the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio]] that Demjanjuk's citizenship be revoked on the basis that he had allegedly concealed his involvement with Nazi death camps on his immigration application in 1951. The request followed a lengthy investigation by the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]] after Demjanjuk was identified by five Holocaust survivors on a photo spread used in the investigation of [[Feodor Fedorenko]], a [[Treblinka]] concentration camp guard. Fedorenko was later extradited to the [[USSR]] on his admission that he was such a guard and that he lied on his US immigration applications. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Trial in Israel==

===Extradition===
In October&amp;nbsp;1983, [[Israel]] issued an [[extradition]] request for Demjanjuk to stand trial on Israeli soil under the Nazis and Nazi Collaborators (Punishment) Law of 1950. Demjanjuk appealed his deportation with the case heard on 8&amp;nbsp;July 1985. During the appeal, the authenticity of the identity card was questioned when it was argued  that the card's number, 1393, had been issued in June/July&amp;nbsp;1942 with the seal of SS Commissioner, [[Odilo Globocnik]], who had in fact been dismissed from this post in March&amp;nbsp;1942 at which time his seal was destroyed. The three identity cards supplied by the [[KGB]] that the experts had used to compare their paper and ink with Demjanjuk's card to prove its authenticity were also disputed. Among other contentions such as graphic inconsistencies, the cards, all dated 1942, carried Waffen SS stamps despite their not taking control of the Trawniki camp until 1943. Two bore the signature of Corporal Teufel when he was at that time a sergeant while the other card which had been issued earlier in the year when Teufel was still a corporal, had his rank listed as sergeant. The cards were also signed by Captain Hermann Hoefle, who was actually a major. The court ruled on this claim: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;the record before us lends no support to this very serious charge, and we reject it. Witnesses fully qualified to testify on the subject stated their opinions that the Trawniki documents were authentic. Even if this documentary evidence had been rejected, the eyewitness evidence alone was found sufficient. Since the district court did not rely on the "Trawniki card", its validity is not before the court.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The appeal was dismissed on 31&amp;nbsp;October 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=John Demjanjuk v. Joseph Petrovsky, et al. |court=United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit |opinion=776 F.2d 571}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trawniki card was later authenticated in subsequent trials.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Trial court, defense counsel, and prosecutors===
Demjanjuk's trial took place in the [[Jerusalem]] District Court between 26&amp;nbsp;November 1986 and 18&amp;nbsp;April 1988, before a special tribunal comprising [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli Supreme Court]] Judge [[Dov Levin]] and Jerusalem District Court Judges Zvi Tal and [[Dalia Dorner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Anti-Semitism%20and%20the%20Holocaust/Documents%20and%20communiques/THE%20DEMJANJUK%20CASE-%20FACTUAL%20AND%20LEGAL%20DETAILS%20-%2028 |title=The Demjanjuk case |quote=John was in trial for accessory to murder charges. |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=28 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demjanjuk was at first represented by N.Y. attorney Mark J. O'Connor, but fired him in July&amp;nbsp;1987 just a week before he was scheduled to testify at his trial. In his place, Demjanjuk hired Israeli trial lawyer Yoram Sheftel whom O'Connor had hired as co-counsel. One of the reasons why Yoram Sheftel defended Demjanjuk was that he was convinced he was not at Treblinka. The defense originally used testimony from other Ukrainian auxiliary police (such as Ignat Danielchenko) to place Demjanjuk in different camps (specifically Sobibor) to prove (and they did) that he was not at Treblinka, however halfway through the trial, Sheftel subtly moved away from this method, fearing future prosecution on other charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rt.com/news/demjanjuk-nazi-criminal-lawyer/ |title=My client isn't Nazi criminal – man dubbed 'Satan's lawyer' speaks out |publisher=Russian Television |date=30 November 2009 |access-date=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Trawnikis|Trawniki-trained camp guards]] with the exception of Eastern-European ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'' did not know German. The ''Volksdeutsche'' who relayed the orders for them were predominantly from ethnic German colonies in Ukraine and Russia, or were taught German. John Demjanjuk had no significant fluency in German.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The prosecution team consisted of Israeli State Attorney Yonah Blatman, Michael Shaked of the Jerusalem District Attorney's Office, Dennis Goldman and Eli Gabay of the International Section of the State Attorney's Office, and others.

===Prosecution case===
According to prosecutors, Demjanjuk had been recruited into the Soviet army in 1940, and he had fought until he was captured by German troops in Eastern [[Crimea]] in May 1942. He was then brought to a German prisoner of war camp in [[Chełm]] in July 1942. Prosecutors claimed that Demjanjuk volunteered to collaborate with the Germans and was sent to the camp at [[Trawniki]], where he was trained to guard prisoners and was given a firearm, a uniform, and an ID card with his photograph. The principal allegation was that three former prisoners identified Demjanjuk as "Иван Грозный" (Ivan Grozny, Russian for "Ivan the Terrible") of Treblinka, who operated the diesel engines sending gas to the death chamber.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;More than 30&amp;nbsp;testimonies from Jewish ex-prisoners of the Treblinka Camp taken under oath in 1945 named Jan Rogozha as the Ukrainian guard who operated the engines. In 1954, four Ukrainian guards named the guard as Ivan Marchenko in their war crimes trial. In 1956 all four retracted their testimony claiming it was given under duress.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The case of John Demjanjuk, Sr. |author-link=James Traficant |author=Traficant, Hon. James A., Jr. |series=Extension of Remarks, 28 February 1991 |date=1 March 1991 |publisher=[[United States House of Representatives]] |id=E735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutors based part of these allegations on an ID&amp;nbsp;card referred to as the "Trawnicki card". This ID&amp;nbsp;card was obtained from the [[USSR]] and provided to Israel by American industrialist [[Armand Hammer]], a close associate of several Kremlin leaders, including Lenin and Stalin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=United Press International |date=6 March 1987 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-03-06/news/mn-4999_1_john-demjanjuk |title=Demjanjuk quoted: Guards only followed orders |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |location=Jerusalem |access-date=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defense claimed that the card was forged by Soviet authorities to discredit Demjanjuk.{{Sfn|Kudryashov|2004|p=228}} The card had Demjanjuk's photograph, which he identified as his picture at the time. The prosecution called expert witnesses to testify on the authenticity of the card including its signatures by various Nazi officers, paper, and ink. The defense used some evidence supplied by the Soviets to support their case while calling other pieces of evidence supplied by the Soviets "forgeries".&lt;ref name=Nizkor_trial&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/d/demjanjuk-john/israeli-data/demjanjuk-s1-2.html |title=The Demjanjuk Case: The trial |publisher=[[Nizkor Project]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concealed exculpatory evidence===
On 5&amp;nbsp;March 1992, German magazine ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' published a claim that the Israeli prosecution concealed crucial information about the Travniki card being a forgery, and that the Israelis had the full co-operation of the German police and the Ministry of Justice. The article stated that on 23&amp;nbsp;January 1986, three weeks before the trial, Superintendent Amnon Bezaleli took the original Trawniki card for examination at the German police force's main criminal-identification laboratory at the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police Office]] (BKA) in [[Wiesbaden]]. Bezaleli was the prosecution's central witness on the Trawniki document.  According to Stern, the BKA, after a cursory examination, told Bezaleli that this was a counterfeit document forged in a more or less amateur way.

The BKA laboratory's preliminary analysis addressed the following points: The face in the photograph, which the prosecution identified as Demjanjuk's, had been pasted onto the uniform using photomontage techniques; the picture was not originally attached to the card, but had been transferred from another document; there was no match between the seal on the Travniki picture and that on the document itself. The analysts did not have time to compare Demjanjuk's known signature with the Demjanjuk signature on the Travniki document. Dr.&amp;nbsp;Louis Ferdinand Werner, head of the BKA, speculated to Bezaleli in a private conversation that the card was counterfeit. Bezaleli consulted people from the state prosecutor's office in Jerusalem, then instructed Werner to stop all tests on the card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sheftel |first1=Yoram |year=1994 |title=The Demjanjuk Affair: The Rise and Fall of a Show-Trial |edition=Revised |location=London |publisher=[[Victor Gollancz]] |type=Hardcover |pages=336–337 |isbn=978-0575057951}} {{ISBN|9780575057951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other identification and more concealed exculpatory evidence===
Other controversial evidence included Demjanjuk's tattoo. Demjanjuk admitted the scar under his armpit was a [[Waffen-SS]] tattoo, which he removed after the war, as did many soldiers to avoid summary execution by the Soviets. The tattoo was probably an [[SS blood group tattoo]] given to him when he joined the [[Russian Liberation Army]]. The blood group tattoo was applied by army medics and used by combat soldiers in [[Waffen-SS foreign volunteers and conscripts]] because they were likely to need blood or give transfusions. There is no evidence that POWs trained as police auxiliaries at Trawniki were required to receive such tattoos, although it was an option for those that volunteered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007956 |title=John Demjanjuk: Prosecution of a Nazi collaborator |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |access-date=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, Demjanjuk was again identified on the photo spread by Otto Horn, a former German SS guard at Treblinka.&lt;ref name=Nizkor_trial/&gt; This testimony became controversial later because it was discovered by Yoram Sheftel that on 14&amp;nbsp;November 1979, Otto Horn was interviewed by the newly created US Department of Justice Office of Special Investigations (OSI). The OSI showed him the picture of Demjanjuk, but at that time Horn failed to identify Demjanjuk as Ivan the Terrible, or even as a guard from Treblinka, or as anyone he ever knew in the SS forces.  The OSI report regarding Otto Horn's failure to identify John Demjanjuk as Ivan the Terrible would have been exculpatory, but was withheld by the OSI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sheftel |first=Yoram |year=1998 |series=The Crimes of the Department of Justice Permanent Bureaucracy |title=Reckless Disregard for the Truth – The case of John Demanjuk |chapter=The Testimony of Yoram Sheftel |work=The American Almanac |url=http://american_almanac.tripod.com/sheftel.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-contradiction by star-witness===
One remarkable event involved a star witness for the prosecution, Eliyahu Rosenberg. Asked by the prosecution if he recognized Demjanjuk, Rosenberg asked that the defendant remove his glasses "so I can see his eyes." Rosenberg approached and peered closely at Demjanjuk's face. When Demjanjuk smiled and offered his hand, Rosenberg recoiled and shouted "Grozny!" meaning "Terrible" in Polish and Russian. "Ivan", Rosenberg said. "I say it unhesitatingly, without the slightest shadow of a doubt. It is Ivan from Treblinka, from the gas chambers, the man I am looking at now." "I saw his eyes, I saw those murderous eyes", Rosenberg told the court, glaring at Demjanjuk. Rosenberg then exclaimed directly to Demjanjuk: "How dare you put out your hand, murderer that you are!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Broder, Jonathan |date=26 February 1987 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-02-26/news/8701160051_1_camp-uprising-eliyahu-rosenberg-demjanjuk-claims |title=2nd witness calls Demjanjuk 'Ivan the Terrible' |newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was later revealed with great embarrassment for the prosecution that Eliyahu Rosenberg had previously testified in a 1947 deposition that "Ivan the Terrible" had been killed during a prisoner uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pyle, Christopher H. |year=2001 |title=Extradition, Politics, and Human Rights |publisher=Temple University Press. |ISBN=1-56639-823-1 |chapter=19. Ivan who? Getting the wrong man}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demjanjuk's testimony===
Demjanjuk testified during the trial that he was imprisoned in a camp in Chełm until 1944, when he was transferred to another camp in Austria, where he remained until he joined an anti-Soviet Ukrainian army group. At that time, Ukrainian military groups like the [[Ukrainian National Army]] were forming in western Austria. Demjanjuk claimed that a few months later he joined an anti-Soviet Russian military organization, the [[Russian Liberation Army]] (Vlasov Army) funded by the Nazi German government until the surrender of Nazi Germany to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1945.

Demjanjuk's memory regarding specifics of this period may have been impaired by severe trauma and malnutrition during his internment as a POW in Nazi concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Draaisma |first=Douwe |year=2012 |title=Why Life Speeds Up As You Get Older: How memory shapes our past |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1107646261 |chapter=10. Trauma and Memory: The Demjanjuk Case}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reliability of witnesses' memory (including issues of [[confabulation]], stress-impaired memory, [[memory errors]]) and the psychology of witnesses' testimony (such as unconscious transference and mistaken identity, positive response bias, weapon focus effect, [[confirmation bias]]) were also key issues of expert testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ewing |first1=Charles Patrick |first2=Joseph T. | last2= McCann |year= 2006 |title= Minds on Trial: Great cases in law and psychology |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=10.

===Verdict and sentence===
On 18&amp;nbsp;April 1988, the Jerusalem District Court found Demjanjuk "unhesitatingly and with utter conviction" guilty of all charges and being Ivan the Terrible. One week later it sentenced him to death by [[hanging]].&lt;ref name=Sentence&gt;{{cite book |title=Israel 50 |year=1997 |ISBN=965-474-005-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demjanjuk was placed in [[solitary confinement]] during the appeals process.&lt;ref name= Acquittal&gt;{{cite news |last=Hedges |first=Chris |date=30 July 1993 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5D8103AF933A05754C0A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Acquittal in Jerusalem; Israel court sets Demjanjuk free, but he is now without a country |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, carpenters began building the gallows that would be used to hang him if his appeals were rejected, and Demjanjuk heard the construction from his cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.economist.com/obituary/2012/03/24/john-demjanjuk |magazine=The Economist |department=Obituary |date=2012-03-24 |title=John Demjanjuk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli Supreme Court reversal===
On 29&amp;nbsp;July 1993, a five-judge panel of the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli Supreme Court]] overturned the guilty verdict on appeal. Their ruling was based on the written statements of 37&amp;nbsp;former guards at Treblinka that identified Ivan the Terrible as "Ivan Marchenko".&lt;ref name= "Acquittal"/&gt; Central to the new evidence was a photograph of Ivan the Terrible and a description that did not match the 1942 appearance of Demjanjuk. The accounts of 21&amp;nbsp;guards who were tried in the Soviet Union on war crimes gave details that differentiate Demjanjuk from Ivan the Terrible – in particular that 'Ivan the Terrible's surname was Marchenko, not Demjanjuk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Williams, Daniel |date=21 December 1991 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-12-21/news/mn-608_1_nazi-death-camp |title=KGB evidence reopens the case of 'Ivan the Terrible': Holocaust: Recently released files bolster the appeal of the man convicted as a Nazi death camp monster |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One described Ivan the Terrible as having brown hair, hazel eyes and a large scar down to his neck; Demjanjuk was blond with grayish-blue eyes and no such scar. US officials had originally been aware, without informing Demjanjuk's attorneys, of the testimony of two of these German guards.&lt;ref name="time 1993"&gt;{{cite magazine |author1=Beyer, Lisa |author2=Johnson, Julie |author3=Myers, Ken |date=2 August 1993 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978969,00.html |title=Ivan the not-so-terrible |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the Israeli justices noted that Demjanjuk had incorrectly listed his mother's maiden name as "Marchenko" in his 1951 application for US visa.&lt;ref name= "Acquittal"/&gt; Demjanjuk said he just wrote a common Ukrainian surname after he forgot his mother's real name.&lt;ref name= "time 1993"/&gt;

The former guards' statements were obtained after World War&amp;nbsp;II by the Soviets, who prosecuted USSR citizens who had assisted the Nazis as auxiliary forces during the war. Most of the guards were executed after the war by the Soviets{{Sfn|Kudryashov|2004|p=237}} and their written statements were not obtained by Israeli authorities until 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed.&lt;ref name="time 1993"/&gt; Russian historian Sergei Kudryashov pointed out that if the defense's claims of a [[KGB]] plot to defame Demjanjuk had been the case, then the Soviet files that established that Demjanjuk was not "Ivan the Terrible" would have never been made available to the defense.{{Sfn|Kudryashov 2004|p=238}}

After the collapse of the USSR, the governments of Ukraine and Russia were for a time more open than the previous Soviet regimes. The Soviet KGB was known to use [[disinformation]], in particular through the use of forgeries, to discredit, denigrate, and confuse its enemies, including Ukrainian communities in the West that supported Ukrainian independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Romerstein |first=Herbert |title=Disinformation as a Weapon in the Cold War |journal=Journal of Intelligence History |volume=8 |number=2 |date=Winter 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli Supreme Court's 405&amp;nbsp;page ruling included the following: 

{{quote|The main issue of the indictment sheet filed against the appellant was his identification as Ivan the Terrible, an operator of the gas chambers in the extermination camp at Treblinka ... By virtue of this gnawing [new evidence indicating mistaken identity] ... we restrained ourselves from convicting the appellant of the horrors of Treblinka. Ivan Demjanjuk has been acquitted by us, because of doubt, of the terrible charges attributed to Ivan the Terrible of Treblinka. This was the proper course for judges who cannot examine the heart and mind, but have only what their eyes see and read ...&amp;nbsp;. The facts proved the appellant's participation in the extermination process. The matter is closed – but not complete, the complete truth is not the prerogative of the human judge.&lt;ref name="Acquittal"/&gt;}}

The court judgment addressed evidence against Demjanjuk that was not included in his indictment. The judges agreed that Demjanjuk most likely served as a Nazi ''Wachmann'' (guard) in the Trawniki unit&lt;ref name="Acquittal"/&gt; and had been posted at Sobibor extermination camp and two other camps. Evidence to assist this claim included an identification card from Trawniki bearing Demjanjuk's picture and personal information&lt;ref name="Acquittal" /&gt; – allegedly found in the Soviet archives – in addition to German documents that mentioned "Wachmann" Demjanjuk and mentioned his date and place of birth. The 1949 statement of another ''Wachmann'', Danilchenko, who had identified a Demjanjuk in passing as someone who allegedly served with him at Sobibor in 1944 (a year after the camp had been razed) and noted he had been born the same year as himself (1923). In 1979, Danilchenko made another statement adding that Demjanjuk was allegedly three years older than himself and had been in Sobibor in 1943. None of Danilchenko's allegations were ever subjected to cross-examination.

The alleged Trawniki certificate also implied that Demjanjuk had served at Sobibor, as did the German orders of March&amp;nbsp;1943 posting his Trawniki unit to the area.&lt;ref name="Acquittal"/&gt;

===Post-acquittal===
After Demjanjuk's acquittal, the [[Attorney General of Israel|Israeli Attorney-General]] decided to release him rather than to pursue charges of committing crimes at Sobibor. Ten petitions against the decision were made to the Supreme Court. On 18&amp;nbsp;August 1993, the court rejected the petitions on the grounds that
# the principle of [[double jeopardy]] would be infringed,
# that new charges would be unreasonable given the seriousness of those of which he had been acquitted,
# that conviction on the new charges would be unlikely, and
# that Demjanjuk was extradited from the United States specifically to stand trial for offenses attributed to Ivan the Terrible of Treblinka, and not for other alternative charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Anti-Semitism%20and%20the%20Holocaust/Documents%20and%20communiques/DECISION%20OF%20ISRAEL%20SUPREME%20COURT%20ON%20PETITION%20CONCE |title=Decision of Israel Supreme Court on petition concerning John (Ivan) Demjanjuk |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=18 August 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, the prosecution argued that Demjanjuk should be tried for alleged crimes at Sobibor; however, Justice Aharon Barak was not convinced, stating "We know nothing about him at Sobibor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pyle |first= Christopher H. |year= 2001 |title=Extradition, Politics, and Human Rights |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-823-7 |chapter=10. Extradition as a substitute for deportation: Getting Ivan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon Wiesenthal]], an iconic figure in Nazi hunting, first believed Demjanjuk was guilty, but after Demjanjuk's acquittal by the Israeli Supreme Court said he too would have cleared him given the new evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Segev, Tom |date=2012 |title=Simon Wiesenthal: The life and legends |publisher=Schocken |edition=Reprint |page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoram Sheftel's 1994 book ''The Demjanjuk Affair: The rise and fall of a show-trial'' became an immediate best-seller in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sheftel |first1=Yoram |year=1994 |title=The Demjanjuk Affair: The Rise and Fall of a Show-Trial |edition=Revised |location=London |publisher=Victor Gollancz |type=Hardcover |isbn=978-0575057951}} {{ISBN|9780575057951}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing many issues pertaining to the law, Sheftel revealed serious errors, deliberate fabrications, and "fraud on the court" perpetrated by the US Department of Justice Office of Special Investigations (OSI) lawyers in their prosecution of the Demjanjuk case.

Demjanjuk was released to return to the United States. In 1993, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled that Demjanjuk was a victim of fraud on the court, as [[United States federal government]] trial lawyers with the Office of Special Investigations had recklessly failed to disclose [[evidence (law)|evidence]], and the extradition order previously granted was rescinded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Demjanjuk v. Petrovsky |opinion=10 F.3d 338 |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report submitted to the Sixth Circuit prior to the Israeli acquittal, federal judge [[Thomas A. Wiseman, Jr.]] concluded that American federal officials had erred in asserting that Demjanjuk was Ivan the Terrible, but that evidence instead pointed to Demjanjuk being a lesser SS agent.&lt;ref name="time 1993"/&gt; After the Court of Appeals remanded the matter to Judge Wiseman, Judge Wiseman dismissed the denaturalization petition proceedings in 1998, effectively restoring Demjanjuk's citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Demjajunk |opinion=No. C77-923 |court=N.D. Ohio |date=20 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transcripts of Demjanjuk's 1988 trial, and the character of Demjanjuk himself, appear in [[Philip Roth]]'s 1993 novel ''[[Operation Shylock]]''.

==Second round of charges, deportation, and prosecution==
[[File:Wikipedia-sobibor-2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Sobibor]] "Road to Heaven" in 2007]]
On 20 February 1998, a [[Federal District Court]] judge, [[Paul Matia]], ruled that Demjanjuk's citizenship could be restored.&lt;ref name="database"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalcrimesdatabase.org/Case/191/Demjanjuk/ |title=ICD - Demjanjuk - Asser Institute |accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 May 1999, the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] filed a new civil complaint against Demjanjuk.&lt;ref name="database" /&gt; No mention was made in the new complaint of the previous allegations that Demjanjuk was Ivan the Terrible. Instead, the complaint alleged that Demjanjuk served as a guard at the [[Sobibór]] and [[Majdanek]] camps in Poland under German occupation and at the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenburg]] camp in Germany. It additionally accused Demjanjuk of being a member of an SS-run unit that took part in capturing nearly two million Jews in the [[General Government|General Government of Poland]]. He was put on trial again in 2001.

===Second loss of U.S. citizenship===
In February 2002 Judge Matia revoked Demjanjuk's US citizenship.&lt;ref name="ClevelandJewishNews22032012"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/article_245c2a22-742c-11e1-a3fa-0019bb2963f4.html |title=John Demjanjuk: Timeline of his life |newspaper=[[Cleveland Jewish News]] |date=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21&amp;nbsp;February 2002, Judge Matia ruled that Demjanjuk had not produced any credible evidence of his whereabouts during the war and that the Justice Department had proved its case against him. On 30&amp;nbsp;April 2004, a three-judge panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|6th US Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled that Demjanjuk could be again stripped of his US citizenship because the Justice Department had presented "clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence" of Demjanjuk's service in Nazi death camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=USA v. Demjanjuk |opinion=No. 02-3529 |court=6th Cir. |date=30 April 2004 |url=http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/04a0125p-06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Supreme Court]] declined to hear his appeal in November&amp;nbsp;2004.&lt;ref name="database" /&gt;

===New court order===
On 28&amp;nbsp;December 2005, an immigration judge ordered Demjanjuk deported to Germany, Poland or Ukraine. In an attempt to avoid deportation, Demjanjuk sought protection under the [[United Nations Convention against Torture]], claiming that he would be prosecuted and tortured if he were deported to Ukraine. Chief US Immigration Judge Michael Creppy ruled there was no evidence to substantiate Demjanjuk's claim that he would be mistreated if he were sent to Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/29/national/29demjanjuk.html?_r=1 |title=Judge orders accused camp guard deported |work=The New York Times |date=29 December 2005 |agency= Associated Press |accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22&amp;nbsp;December 2006, the [[Board of Immigration Appeals]] upheld the deportation order.&lt;ref name="BBCNews"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6202319.stm |title=US 'Nazi guard' faces deportation |publisher=BBC News |date=22 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30&amp;nbsp;January 2008, the [[Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] denied Demjanjuk's request for review.&lt;ref name="X" group=lower-alpha&gt;Demjanjuk did not, on his appeal, contest the Board's decision on its merits. His sole ground for appeal was that the Immigration Judge who had heard his case – Judge Creppy – was not an "immigration judge" within the meaning of the law and was therefore without jurisdiction to decide the case, thereby nullifying the proceeding. The Sixth Circuit found his argument to be without merit. {{cite court |litigants=Demjanjuk v.

===Deportation proceedings and actions===
One month after the US Supreme Court's refusal to hear Demjanjuk's case, on 19&amp;nbsp;June 2008, Germany announced it would seek the extradition of Demjanjuk to Germany. The file on Demjanjuk was compiled by the special German office investigating Nazi crimes. [[Kurt Schrimm]], who heads the office, said that investigators "have managed to obtain hundreds of documents and have also found a number of witnesses who spoke out against Demjanjuk". "For the first time we have even found lists of names of the people who Demjanjuk personally led into the gas chambers. We have no doubt that he is responsible for the death of over 29,000&amp;nbsp;Jews" at the Nazis' Sobibor death camp, he said. Kurt Schrimm said that Demjanjuk could be brought to Germany by the end of 2008; however, this did not occur&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7721631.stm |title=Germans seek 'Nazi guard' charges |publisher=BBC News |date=11 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/world/AP-Germany-Nazi-Guard.html |title=Germany seeks extradition of Nazi guard from US |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=19 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10&amp;nbsp;November 2008, German federal prosecutor Kurt Schrimm directed prosecutors to file in Munich for extradition, since Demjanjuk once lived there. On 9&amp;nbsp;December 2008, a German federal court declared that Demjanjuk could be tried for his alleged role in the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Court: 'Ivan the Terrible' can be tried in Germany |url=http://www.thelocal.de/national/20081211-16079.html |agency=Agence France-Presse |work=The Local |date=11 December 2008 |accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some three months later, on 11&amp;nbsp;March 2009, Demjanjuk was charged with more than 29,000&amp;nbsp;counts of accessory to murder of Jewish prisoners at the Sobibor extermination camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rising, David |date=11 March 2009 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090311/ap_on_re_eu/eu_germany_demjanjuk |title=Former Nazi camp guard charged 29,000&amp;nbsp;times |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Foreign Office (Germany)|German foreign ministry]] announced on 2 April 2009 that Demjanjuk would be transferred to Germany the following week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Former Nazi camp guard to be deported to Germany |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/04/02/nazi.guard/?iref=mpstoryview |publisher=CNN |date=2 April 2009 |accessdate=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would face trial beginning 30&amp;nbsp;November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Demjanjuk's trial in Germany to start 30&amp;nbsp;November |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/10/john_demjanjuks_trial_in_germa_1.html |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |date=6 October 2009 |accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demjanjuk sued Germany on 30&amp;nbsp;April 2009, to try to block the German government's agreement to accept Demjanjuk from the US.&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt; His filing with the German Administrative Court in Berlin claimed that the procedure by which he was to be moved from the US to Germany was illegal, and asked the Court to suspend the declaration by the German government that allowed Demjanjuk to enter the country pursuant to US deportation, until a court determination is made.&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt; The German Administrative Court rejected Demjanjuk's claim on 6&amp;nbsp;May; Demjanjuk's German attorney stated that he would appeal the decision.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite news |author=Matussek, Karin |date=6 May 2009 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&amp;sid=aNt5rPIHBQRQ&amp;refer=germany |title=Demjanjuk loses German court bid to block deportation |agency=[[Bloomberg LP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motion to reopen the case===
On that same day – 2&amp;nbsp;April 2009 – Demjanjuk filed a motion in an immigration trial court in [[Virginia]]. The motion sought to reopen the matter of the removal order against him; that order of removal had been originally issued by an immigration court in 2005, had been upheld by the BIA on administrative appeal in late 2006,&lt;ref name="BBCNews"/&gt; and was further upheld by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals;&lt;ref name="X" group=lower-alpha/&gt; after these two appeals, the US Supreme Court had, as noted above, denied any review.&lt;ref name="Y"/&gt; In connection with the motion to reopen, Demjanjuk also asked the immigration court to stay the removal order, pending the decision on whether or not to reopen the matter.

On 3 April 2009, US Immigration Judge Wayne Iskra temporarily stayed Demjanjuk's deportation,&lt;ref name=Reuters-2009-04-03&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. judge stays Demjanjuk deportation |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE5326L620090403 |agency=Reuters |date=3 April 2009 |accessdate=3 April 2009 |first=Sharon |last=Reich}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reversed himself three days later, on 6&amp;nbsp;April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. judge allows deportation of accused Nazi guard |url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/idCATRE5353SF20090406 |agency=Reuters |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=6 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Government noted, a motion to reopen, such as Demjanjuk's, could only properly be filed with the [[Board of Immigration Appeals]] (BIA) in Washington, D.C., and not an immigration trial court. The issuance of the stay by the immigration trial court was therefore improper, as that court had no jurisdiction over the matter. Accordingly, Demjanjuk re-filed his motion to reopen, and for an attendant stay, with the BIA.&lt;ref name="X1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/documents/GovernmentResponse.pdf |title=6th Circuit Brief |publisher=U.S. Courts |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419064313/http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/documents/GovernmentResponse.pdf |archive-date=19 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= CNN&gt;{{cite news |title=Nazi suspect's deportation appeal rejected |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/04/10/nazi.suspect.deportation/index.html |publisher=CNN.com |date=10 April 2009 |accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demjanjuk's motion to reopen argued that, under the circumstances, his deportation to Germany would constitute torture. His attorney stated that his health had deteriorated seriously in the last four years. Demjanjuk argued that his request was supported by the past actions of the very same Office of Special Investigations where in the Tannenbaum case the DOJ allowed another sick old man to remain in the United States who had admitted to mistreatment of prisoners in a Nazi camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last= McFadden| first= Robert D. |date= 5 February 1988| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/05/nyregion/a-jew-who-beat-jews-in-a-nazi-camp-is-stripped-of-his-citizenship.html |title= A Jew Who Beat Jews in a Nazi Camp Is Stripped of His Citizenship |work= The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10&amp;nbsp;April, the BIA found there was "little likelihood of success that [Demjanjuk's] pending motion to re-open the case will be granted" and accordingly denied his motion for a stay pending the disposition of his motion to reopen. This removed any obstacles to federal agents seizing him for deportation to Germany.&lt;ref name= CNN /&gt;

The Government has responded to Demjanjuk's torture claim as a basis for reopening the deportation order – a case that was decided against Demjanjuk in 2005 and that has been thrice affirmed against him on appeal – by stating that his claim is "patently frivolous".

====Sixth Circuit's stay====
On 14&amp;nbsp;April 2009, immigration agents removed Demjanjuk from his home in preparation for deportation.&lt;ref name=AP1&gt;{{cite news |title=Demjanjuk removed from Ohio home on stretcher |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g2v8DW3HMQZ6Y10UI-GQXPnez11QD97IE0R00 |agency=Associated Press |date=14 April 2009 |accessdate=14 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, Demjanjuk's son filed a motion in the [[Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] asking that the deportation be stayed,&lt;ref name=AP1/&gt; which was subsequently granted.&lt;ref name=CNN1&gt;{{cite news |title=Nazi war crimes suspect granted emergency stay|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/04/14/us.nazi.suspect/index.html |work=CNN |date=14 April 2009 |accessdate=14 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government argued that the Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction to review the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals, which denied the stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Demjanjuk v.

The BIA denied Demjanjuk's motion to reopen his deportation case.

The Sixth Circuit, whose stay of the deportation order remained in effect, asked lawyers for both parties to provide it with more information from the government, physicians and Demjanjuk himself. On 20&amp;nbsp;April, the government filed a motion with the Sixth Circuit asking for the stay against deportation to be lifted, arguing that Demjanjuk had sought the stay in order to provide an opportunity for the BIA to rule upon his motion to reopen the deportation order. Since the BIA denied the motion, the government argued, the basis for the Sixth Circuit's stay was no longer valid, and the stay should accordingly be dismissed.&lt;ref name=JP&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1239710743699 |title=Demjanjuk is most wanted Nazi criminal |dead-url=true |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=21 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[The Jerusalem Post|Jerusalem Post]]'' also reported that the Simon Wiesenthal Center had declared Demjanjuk to be the "most wanted Nazi war criminal" on its list, displacing SS doctor [[Aribert Heim]]. According to a spokesman for the Center, the revised ranking was intended to reflect the importance attributed to the US efforts to deport Demjanjuk to Germany to stand trial.&lt;ref name=JP/&gt;

====Sixth Circuit's stay lifted====
On 1&amp;nbsp;May 2009, the Sixth Circuit lifted the [[Preliminary injunction|stay]] that it had imposed against Demjanjuk's deportation order. The Court stated in its opinion that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Based on the medical information before the court and the government's representations about the conditions under which it will transport the petitioner, which include an aircraft equipped as a medical air ambulance and attendance by medical personnel, the court cannot find that the petitioner's removal to Germany is likely to cause irreparable harm sufficient to warrant a stay of removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8029574.stm |title=Demjanjuk loses deportation case |publisher=BBC News |date=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court also ruled that it was unlikely that Demjanjuk could demonstrate that he would be "tortured" in Germany and that this claim did not sufficiently support his request for a stay.&lt;ref name=Spiegel&gt;{{cite news |author=Meyer, Cordula |date=1 May 2009  |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,622357,00.html |title=Demjanjuk sues German government |magazine=[[Der Spiegel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reut&gt;{{cite news |author=Stern, Andrew |date=1 May 2009 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN01315073 |title=US court clears way for Demjanjuk removal |agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CA6&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/documents/Order_001.pdf |title=Court Order Denying Stay |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the stay was lifted, and the government freed of legal constraints that prevented it from deporting Demjanjuk, his appeal for the substantive review of the BIA decision on the merits (wherein the BIA effectively upheld the deportation order itself, by refusing to reopen the case on the ground that "torture" in Germany was more likely than not) was still pending before the Court of Appeals.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Case No. 09-3469. Companion case 09-3416, wherein Demjanjuk sought a stay prior to the BIA's denial of his motion to reopen the case on the merits, was dismissed as moot.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Court stated in its opinion denying the stay (in the process of addressing the question of the extent to which Demjanjuk was likely to succeed on the merits of his motion to reopen) that: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;...  the petitioner has not shown a strong or substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his challenge to ... the [BIA's] denial of his motion to reopen. At most, he has offered speculation that German authorities may not adequately attend to his medical needs while he is in ... custody.&lt;ref name=CA6/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Petition to Supreme Court====
On Tuesday 5&amp;nbsp;May 2009, Demjanjuk announced through counsel that he was filing a petition with the US Supreme Court, seeking review of the adverse decision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals that had denied his stay. His counsel expected the filing to be made on Wednesday 6&amp;nbsp;May. The filing characterized the unanimous decision of the three-judge Sixth Circuit panel as "incomprehensible". On Thursday 7&amp;nbsp;May 2009, the [[SCOTUS|United States Supreme Court]], via Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], declined to consider Demjanjuk's case for review, thereby denying Demjanjuk any further stay of deportation. Justice Stevens issued his decision without comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30626371/ |title=Supreme Court denies alleged Nazi guard's plea |publisher=MSNBC |date=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sp&gt;{{cite news |author=Meyer, Cordula |date=8 May 2009 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,623665,00.html#ref=nlint |title=Alleged Nazi guard Demjanjuk hits legal brick wall |magazine=[[Der Spiegel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demjanjuk's counsel thereafter stated that his client would not seek to have the entire Court consider Justice Stevens' decision and that accordingly all legal avenues in the United States to halt the deportation had been exhausted.

===="Torture" as basis for reopening the case====
Demjanjuk's motion to reopen was based on the claim that he would be tortured as a result of being deported. Demjanjuk claimed that, because he was old and sick, transferring him to Germany would constitute "[[Torture and the United States|torture]]" within the meaning of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] (the Convention), and that this circumstance was sufficient to reopen consideration of his case.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;This sentence was a summary of the legal arguments on "torture" presented by Demjanjuk in his legal pleadings. ''See, e.g.''., his {{cite web |url=http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/documents/MotionForStay.pdf |title=Motion for Stay |dead-url=true}} filed with the Sixth Circuit.&lt;/ref&gt; His attorney, John Broadley, argued before the BIA that deporting Demjanjuk would constitute torture because of his health problems, including pre-leukemia, kidney problems, spinal problems and "a couple of types of gout".&lt;ref name=AP1/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN1/&gt; To summarize the foregoing, his essential contention in his legal pleadings and public statements was, that it would be very hard on him, and perhaps life-threatening, to be taken away from his home in his present condition.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;These public statements may be found in the news article citations herein.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that this circumstance would constitute "torture".

While Demjanjuk was removed from his house in a wheelchair and appeared to be "slack-jawed and unmoving", on 23&amp;nbsp;April 2009, federal prosecutors submitted surveillance video evidence taken after the removal of Demjanjuk; the footage showed Demjanjuk walking with no assistance to a car in a parking lot while "alert and engaged in conversation".&lt;ref name="cnn doctor"&gt;{{cite news |author=Frieden, Terry |date=23 April 2009 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/04/23/us.nazi.doctor.report/ |title=US says videos disprove Demjanjuk's claim of poor health |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also provided the Court of Appeals with a medical report that supported their claim that Demjanjuk is medically fit to be moved to Germany; a flight surgeon who examined Demjanjuk while in government custody for alleged back pain later noticed that Demjanjuk "moved his back with apparent ease".&lt;ref name="cnn doctor"/&gt; On 23&amp;nbsp;April 2009, a group of students from the Hebrew Academy of the Five Towns and Rockaway petitioned the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold the deportation order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/General+News/33485/Hundreds+of+High+School+Students+Petition+Judge+to+Deport+Demjanjuk.htm |title=Hundreds of high school students petition judge to deport Demjanjuk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719093152/http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/General+News/33485/Hundreds+of+High+School+Students+Petition+Judge+to+Deport+Demjanjuk.htm |archive-date=19 July 2011 |newspaper=Yeshiva World News |date=27 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deportation to Germany====
During the deportation proceedings, the government lawyers stated that even if the court lifts the stay, they would defer deportation until at least 1&amp;nbsp;May, to allow Demjanjuk time to file an appeal to the US Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="cnn doctor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/news/bild-english/world-news/2009/04/24/john-demjanjuk-video-is-extradition-back-on/is-former-nazi-camp-guard-really-too-ill-to-face-court.html |title=The former Nazi camp guard supposedly 'too ill' to face court |magazine=[[Bild]] |date=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demjanjuk was deported to Germany, leaving Cleveland, Ohio, on 11&amp;nbsp;May 2009, to arrive in [[Munich]] on 12&amp;nbsp;May. Upon his arrival, he was arrested and sent to Munich's [[Stadelheim prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Fischer, Sebastian |author2=Neumann, Conny |author3=Meyer, Cordula |date=12 May 2009 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/zeitgeschichte/0,1518,624265,00.html |title=Krankenwagen bringt Demjanjuk ins Untersuchungsgefängnis |magazine=[[Der Spiegel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Demjanjuk deemed fit to stand trial====
On 3 July 2009, prosecutors deemed Demjanjuk fit to stand trial. On 13 July 2009, prosecutors charged him with 27,900&amp;nbsp;counts of accessory to murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4475603,00.html |title=Germany files charges against alleged Nazi guard Demjanjuk |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors restricted the time Demjanjuk could be tried in court each day to two sessions of 90 minutes each, said Munich State Prosecutor Anton Winkler. Demjanjuk's attorney said that due to the complexity of the evidence, the mandated short sessions could cause the trial to last three to five years.&lt;ref name="ap demjanjuk att'y"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Seattle Times]] |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2009611597_apeugermanydemjanjuk.html |title=Demjanjuk lawyer calls for case to be closed |agency= Associated Press |date=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this and what he called Demjanjuk's ill health, Demjanjuk's attorney called for the case to be closed.&lt;ref name="ap demjanjuk att'y"/&gt;

On 22 September 2009, the [[Lviv]] Regional Council adopted an appeal to the [[President of Ukraine]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]], [[Ukrainian Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] and the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (Ukraine's parliament). Members of the Council asked them to intercede on behalf of Demjanjuk. The deputies also called the prosecution of Demjanjuk an "international conspiracy aimed at discrediting Ukraine and [[Ukrainians]] in the eyes of world public opinion"; they believed "Without a doubt, the materials of the case were forged and fabricated by [[KGB]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Statement of the Lviv Regional Council |url=http://www.lenta.ru/news/2009/09/23/demjanuk |accessdate=12 May 2011 |newspaper=[[Lenta.Ru]] |date=21 September 2009 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Displaced person claim==
On 21 April 2009, ''[[The Australian]]'' reported that Demjanjuk registered in 1948 as a [[displaced person]], a category largely consisting of Eastern European refugees who were housed in [[displaced persons camp]]s after the war until they emigrated to new homes and lives. The [[International Tracing Service]], a German agency that maintains data on Nazi victims, provided a copy of Demjanjuk's 3 March 1948, application to ''The Australian''. In that application, Demjanjuk indicated he was a refugee, sought assistance, and asked for transfer to [[Argentina]]. His application stated that he had worked as a driver in Sobibor Poland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Houwink ten Cate |first=Johannes |date=1 March 2012 |publisher=Jerusalem Centre for Public Affairs |title=Looking Back on the Demjanjuk Trial in Munich |url=http://jcpa.org/article/looking-back-on-the-demjanjuk-trial-in-munich/ |website=JCPA.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the town of Sobibor, in eastern Poland, after which the extermination camp was named.

Demjanjuk later claimed this was a coincidence and that he picked the name Sobibor randomly from a map. After the war, Demjanjuk lived in southern Germany, working as a driver for various international refugee organisations, according to Spiegel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |date=17 March 2012 |department=Obituary |title=John Demjanjuk |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13345166}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Demjanjuk found a job as a driver in a displaced persons camp in the Bavarian city of Landshut, and was subsequently transferred to camps in other southern German cities until he ended up in the town of Feldafing near Munich in May&amp;nbsp;1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rosenbach |first1=Marcel |first2=Jan |last2=Friedmann |date=18 November 2008 |title=Sixty years later, alleged Nazi guard may stand trial |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/delayed-justice-sixty-years-later-alleged-nazi-guard-may-stand-trial-a-591257.html |magazine=[[Der Spiegel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in connection with the story, historian Hans-Jürgen Bömelburg ([[University of Giessen]]) stated that war criminals sometimes tried to escape justice after 1945 by presenting themselves victims of Nazi persecution, rather than as perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25368834-2703,00.html |title=Demjanjuk posed as a Nazi camp victim |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many former [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Soviet POWs]], former [[slave labor]]ers, and concentration camp inmates who found themselves as refugees were motivated to seek anonymity, create aliases, and hide their Soviet Union origins to avoid forced repatriation to Stalinist Russia under the terms of the [[Yalta Conference|Yalta Agreement]]. Many former Soviet POWs, and Soviets who fought against the Red Army were also motivated to conceal their Soviet origins to avoid being executed under secret Allied military operations such as [[Operation Keelhaul]]. After the war ended, there were millions of former forced laborers [[OST-Arbeiter]] in occupied Germany, most of whom were Ukrainian, but also Russian, Belarusian, Crimean Tatar, and others. Many of them, having experienced the brutal and genocidal policies of the Stalin regime, wanted to emigrate to the US or other western democracies rather than being forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union.

According to [[Gitta Sereny]]'s ''The German Trauma'' (2000, {{ISBN|978-0-14-029263-3}}) there was a strong reason why Demjanjuk could have put down the Polish town of Sobibor, 5&amp;nbsp;km west of the Soviet border, as the place where he worked from 1937–1943 as a farmhand (according to Sereny) in the application he made on 3&amp;nbsp;March 1948. Applicants for [[displaced person]] status had to fill in a form that required them to say where they had been for the previous twelve years. Unless they could show that they had been living outside the Soviet Union on 1&amp;nbsp;September 1939, they could not, under the terms of the [[Yalta agreement]], be accepted as displaced persons and would be returned to the Soviet Union. Officials of the [[International Refugee Organisation]], which operated the [[Landshut]] office, therefore encouraged applicants to select places outside the Soviet Union. Sobibor was such a place. Sereny further relates that at Demjanjuk's trial in Israel on the [[Treblinka]] charges, Judge Dov Levin had asked Demjanjuk, "Why did you put Sobibor?" Demjanjuk had replied that he had no idea what to put on the form and that another applicant had had an atlas and told him to put down Sobibor as there had been many Soviets there.

Evidence that Demjanjuk might have been at Sobibor rather than Treblinka contributed to his successful appeal against his conviction in Israel on the Treblinka charges. He was not prosecuted in Israel on any charges relating to Sobibor as, ''inter alia'', his extradition from the US had been obtained on the basis of the Treblinka charges. An 11&amp;nbsp;August 2010, [[Esquire (magazine)|''Esquire'' magazine]] article written and researched by Scott Raab questioned the whole idea of Demjanjuk's trial, crime, and punishment, pointing out many of the absurdities of this particular case, stating specifically

&lt;blockquote&gt;Worse, Demjanjuk is essentially on trial not for anything he did, but simply for being at Sobibor. No specific criminal acts need be alleged, much less proved. Page through transcripts of previous Nazi trials and you'll find a rigorous focus on particulars, because that is what should be required to convict a defendant. No one in any such trial ever was convicted simply on the basis of being present at the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/john-demjanjuk-1109 |title=John Demjanjuk: The last Nazi |magazine=Esquire |date=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Trial in Germany==
On 30 November 2009, Demjanjuk's trial, expected to last for several months, began in [[Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8386576.stm|title=John Demjanjuk war crimes trial begins in Munich|work=BBC News|date=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demjanjuk arrived in the courtroom in a wheelchair pushed by a German police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/world/europe/01trial.html|title=Man Tied to Death Camp Goes on Trial in Germany|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 November 2009|last=Kulish|first=Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 35 plaintiffs were admitted to file in the case, including four survivors of the Sobibor concentration camp and 26 relatives of victims. The [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]] issued a statement in regard to the extradition and the trial, stressing their symbolic significance. "All NS (National Socialist) criminals still living shall know that there won't be mercy for them, regardless of their age. They have to be held accountable for their inhuman deeds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zentralratdjuden.de/de/article/2411.html |title=Statement of the ZDJ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519220859/http://www.zentralratdjuden.de/de/article/2411.html |archive-date=19 May 2009 |date=12 May 2009 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February&amp;nbsp;2010, Alexei Vaitsen, an 87&amp;nbsp;year-old Holocaust survivor living in [[Ryazan]], Russia who escaped from Sobibor during the 1943 uprising, claimed that he recognized Demjanjuk as being one of the camp's personnel in a radio interview in Russia; however, the prosecuting attorney and defense lawyer in Demjanjuk current trial were skeptical about this particular claim.

On 14&amp;nbsp;April 2010, Anton Dallmeyer, an [[expert witness]], testified that the typeset and handwriting on an ID card being used as key evidence matched four other ID cards believed to have been issued at the SS training camp at Trawniki. Demjanjuk's lawyer argued that all of the ID cards could be forgeries, and that there was no point comparing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journal-news.com/news/nation-world-news/expert-demjanjuk-id-appears-authentic-651960.html |title=Expert: Demjanjuk ID appears authentic |first=Andrea M. |last=Jarach |agency=The Associated Press |work=Journal-News.com |accessdate=23 May 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called [[Trawniki concentration camp|Trawniki ID card]] on which the German prosecutors case relied heavily was the same controversial card used previously as evidence by Israeli prosecutors.  It was controversial for several reasons.&lt;ref name=KP2032012Semotiuk/&gt;

* Count [[Nikolai Tolstoy]], a British historian, pointed out to Yoram Sheftel, the Israeli attorney who defended Demjanjuk in Israel, that there was an entire Soviet KGB division known as ''Division&amp;nbsp;14'' that dealt solely with the forgery of documents. Sheftel indicated that the components of such cards, including pre-signed Nazi signatures, seized by Soviet troops were available to the Soviets to make up false papers.
* Dr. Grant, who Sheftel claimed was the world's foremost forensic expert and the man who revealed the forgeries of the ''Mussolini diaries'' and the ''Hitler diaries'', testified in Israel that the Demjanjuk signature on the card differed from all the others attributed to him.  Dr.&amp;nbsp;Grant pointed out that there were two  puncture holes in the right side of the photo on the card but not through the paper of the card. Judging by the purple ink found inside the holes which was similar to ink used by the KGB and the nature of the spacing of the holes, Dr.&amp;nbsp;Grant concluded that the photograph was probably unstapled from some other Soviet document and attached to the ID card in the Soviet Union. Dr.&amp;nbsp;Grant concluded his evidence by saying "The Trawniki document cannot be an authentic document belonging to the defendant Demjanjuk."
* Michael Shaked, the prosecutor in the Israeli case, indicated that on 23&amp;nbsp;January 1987 the original Trawniki card was provided for examination to the German police force's main criminal-identification laboratory in Wiesbaden. The laboratory analysts indicated that even after a cursory examination it was evident that the document was a forgery. The picture was not originally attached to the card, but had been transferred from another document.

On 24&amp;nbsp;February 2010, a star witness for the prosecution, Alex Nagorny, who agreed to serve the Nazi Germans after his capture, raised doubts about the case against Demjanjuk, telling the court the man on trial in Munich state court didn't look like his fellow guard at the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg camp]]. (There were three different former guards named Nagorny and it was not immediately clear whether the man who testified in the Demjanjuk trial was the same who allegedly served in Treblinka.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Haaretz |date=18 February 2011 |title=Witness in alleged Nazi Demjanjuk trial under investigation for murder |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/witness-in-alleged-nazi-demjanjuk-trial-under-investigation-for-murder-1.344255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nagorny told the Munich state court that he knew Demjanjuk from the Flossenbürg camp. "We were brought there and Ivan was already there", the 92&amp;nbsp;year-old testified, referring to Demjanjuk by his birth name. "He was a guard there. He did the same thing I did. I did not know him before Flossenbürg." Nagorny has previously told investigators he arrived at Flossenbürg with Demjanjuk. Nagorny testified he lived with Demjanjuk in a barracks room in Flossenbürg and then shared an apartment with him in Landshut, Germany, after the war. When asked to identify Demjanjuk in the courtroom, Nagorny could not. Nagorny walked over to the bed where Demjanjuk lay and looked at him closely. When Demjanjuk removed the sunglasses that he was wearing, Nagorny said quickly: "That's definitely not him – no resemblance."&lt;ref name="guardian2012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rising |first=David |agency=Associated Press |date=24 February 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8960996 |title=Former guard says Demjanjuk was at Nazi camp |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nagorny also cast doubt on the provenance of the Trawniki card testifying that in the final days of the war the Trawniki guards destroyed their cards before being taken prisoner by the Americans.&lt;ref name="guardian2012" /&gt;

On 15&amp;nbsp;January 2011, Spain requested a European [[arrest warrant]] be issued for alleged Nazi war crimes while Demjanjuk was still on trial in Germany; specifically, it alleged that Demjanjuk was involved in the deaths of 60 Spaniards imprisoned at Flossenbürg while serving as a guard there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/01/15/spain.nazi.warrant/index.html |title=Spain requests warrant for alleged Nazi war criminal |publisher=CNN |accessdate=15 January 2011 |date=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany denied Spain's extradition request on 31 May 2011, citing jurisdictional concerns and insufficient evidence provided by Spanish authorities of Demjanjuk's involvement in the crimes alleged by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/06/12/3088101/german-court-rejects-demjanjuk-extradition-request |title=German court rejects Demjanjuk extradition request |publisher=JTA |date=12 June 2011 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12&amp;nbsp;April 2011, a 1985 [[FBI]] report that had been marked secret for the previous 25&amp;nbsp;years was declassified and found by reporters of the Associated Press News Media in the National Archives. It brought to light a judgment that the Trawniki ID card that had been provided by a Soviet source to the US was "quite likely fabricated" evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=13358386 |title=FBI thought Demjanjuk evidence faked |publisher=ABCnews |accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3&amp;nbsp;May 2012, Dr.&amp;nbsp;Ulrich Busch, Demjanjuk's lawyer, claimed that documents and witness accounts from Trawniki on Demjanjuk differed so widely that there must have been about six different Demjanjuks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |date=10 May 2011 |publisher= Haaretz |title=Demjanjuk attorney disputes trial's legitimacy as verdict nears |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/demjanjuk-attorney-disputes-trial-s-legitimacy-as-verdict-nears-1.360893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12&amp;nbsp;May 2011, aged&amp;nbsp;91, Demjanjuk was convicted as an [[accessory (legal term)|accessory]] to the murder of 27,900&amp;nbsp;Jews and sentenced to five years in prison.&lt;ref name="Matussek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="welt.de"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kraemer"/&gt; Presiding Judge Ralph Alt ordered Demjanjuk released from custody pending his appeal. The judge suspended the remainder of the sentence, noting Demjanjuk had already served 2&amp;nbsp;years during trial, was 91&amp;nbsp;years old, and had served 8&amp;nbsp;years in Israel on related charges that were later overturned. Alt said there were no grounds to hold Demjanjuk. "It's the law, and so it's justice," he added. "I say he's guilty, but it's not a final verdict." Demjanjuk's interim conviction had the potential to set a new legal precedent in Germany, opening the possibility of hundreds of new investigations. This was the first time someone has been convicted solely on the basis of serving as a camp guard, with no evidence of being involved in the death of any specific inmate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2109327,00.html |title=Nazi Criminal John Demjanjuk Dies |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324063906/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2109327,00.html |archive-date=24 March 2012 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rising, David |agency=Associated Press |date=13 May 2011 |url=https://archive.is/20120708070345/http://articles.boston.com/2011-05-13/news/29540669_1_sobibor-nazi-death-camp-guard-john-demjanjuk |title=Former US citizen convicted in Nazi camp deaths |newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feasibility of mistaken identity was bolstered when on 11&amp;nbsp;June 2011, the Kyiv Post reported that in his home village of Dubovye Makharintsy, Vinnytsia Oblast of Ukraine, records show that two Ivan Demjanjuks served in the Soviet Red Army in WW&amp;nbsp;II. Reportedly, one Ivan Andriyevych Demjanjuk committed suicide in 1971, after he learned that Soviet KGB agents had come to question him. According to a Red Army veteran and witness, in the early 1980s, the KGB came to Dubovi Makharyntsi and took all of John Demjanjuk's family photos and letters he had written to his mother and sister, who remained in the village after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Feduschak |first= Natalia A. |newspaper=Kyiv Post |date=11 June 2011 |title=Case of Mistaken Identity? |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/case-of-mistaken-identity.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demjanjuk's conviction was invalidated upon his death because the German Appellate Court had not tried the appeal, nor ruled on the validity of the legal precedent.  According to German law, no conviction stands until all appeal rights have been exhausted. The court did not explain why the appeal hearings were delayed. As a consequence, Demjanjuk remains legally innocent.&lt;ref name=KP2032012Semotiuk/&gt;

===Criticism===
The unique nature of the legal argument he was convicted under has been noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Demjanjuk guilty of Nazi death camp murders |publisher=BBC News |date=12 May 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12321549 |quote=No evidence was produced that he committed a specific crime. It was the first time such a legal argument was made in a German court.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christiaan F. Rüter, Professor of Law and expert on NS trials in Germany, who researched the subject at the [[University of Amsterdam]] for 40&amp;nbsp;years, expressed reservations against the commencement of proceedings stating that to him "it is a complete mystery, how anyone who knows the German jurisdiction up to now, would be able to assume that Demjanjuk could be sentenced based on the given evidence."&lt;ref name=HM30112009Douglas&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lawrence |last=Douglas |authorlink=Lawrence Douglas |date=30 November 2009 |url= http://harpers.org/archive/2012/03/0083831 |title=Ivan the recumbent, or Demjanjuk in Munich: Enduring the "last great Nazi war-crimes trial |magazine=[[Harper's Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial has been criticized for its lack of evidence other than an interview summary supposedly conducted by the Soviet Union [[KGB]] of another prison guard who died some time in the 1990s, and a Soviet-supplied ID card from the Trawniki camp that a 1985 report from the Cleveland office of the FBI concluded was "quite likely" a KGB forgery.&lt;ref name=KP2032012Semotiuk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The persecution of John Demjanjuk |publisher=[[Pat Buchanan]] |url=http://buchanan.org/blog/the-persecution-of-john-demjanjuk-4743 |website=Buchanan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, Demjanjuk accused Germany of using him as a [[scapegoat]] "to make them (the war crimes) forgotten and to claim that the true criminals of the Nazi crimes were me, the [[Ukrainians]] and the European neighbours of [[Nazi Germany]]".&lt;ref name=KP2032012Semotiuk/&gt;

Yoram Sheftel, the lawyer who represented Demjanjuk during the Israel trial in the 1980s, criticized the German court for conducting a show trial. "There was a shameful farce here", he said. "Certainly the German court did not believe its own ruling." "Nothing has changed since then", he said. "Even during the trial in Germany, there was not one person who testified that Demjanjuk was Ivan from Sobibor, by virtue that he was seen there, and as such the conviction is a farce." Sheftel said he was convinced that the Israeli Supreme Court's acquittal and ruling regarding Demjanjuk's innocence was correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Benari |first1= Elad |first2=Arutz |last2=Sheva |date=13 May 2011 |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/144135#.T5Vk1K6_d5Y |title=Sheftel: Demjanjuk verdict is a 'Farce' |publisher=Israel National News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheftel said there was "no credible evidence to produce any crime against Demjanjuk to convict him on any charge connected to the Holocaust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Newshound, Russia TV |title=Interview with Yoram Sheftel, Demjanjuk's Ex-Lawyer: No Evidence to tie Demjanjuk to holocaust, Part&amp;nbsp;2 |access-date=23 April 2012 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALGvOCM0ei8&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and posthumous appeal to restore US citizenship==
John Demjanjuk died at a [[care home|home for the elderly]] in [[Bad Feilnbach]], Germany on 17 March 2012, aged 91.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17414127 "'Nazi guard' John Demjanjuk dies"], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of his appeal not having been heard, Demjanuk's conviction of May 2011 by a lower court was invalidated; and he died without a criminal record.&lt;ref name= technicality /&gt; Demjanjuk's lawyer, Dr. Ulrich Busch, had demanded that the Munich court publish a clarifying statement that Demjanjuk was presumed innocent and without a criminal record "[g]iven the false statements in international media reports that Demjanjuk died a convicted war criminal".&lt;ref name= technicality/&gt;

Following his death, his relatives requested that he be buried in the United States, where he used to live. Jewish organizations have opposed this, claiming that his burial site would become a centre for [[neo-Nazi]] activity.&lt;ref name=DemjanjukBBCNews2032012&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17448458 |title=Demjanjuk family asks to bury Nazi war criminal in US |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2117481/Will-Demjanjuk-buried-Cleveland--Nazi-shrine.html |title=Fears former death camp guard John Demjanjuk will be buried in Cleveland and grave turned into a Nazi shrine |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March 2012, John Demjanjuk was reported to be buried at an undisclosed US location, now known to be the Ukrainian section of the Brooklyn Heights cemetery in [[Parma, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=13 April 2012|title=Ukrainian political party leader says Demjanjuk was buried in US weeks after his March death|accessdate=23 April 2012|url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/04/05/3092564/demjanjuk-reportedly-buried-secretly-in-united-states}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 April 2012, Demjanjuk's attorney's filed an appeal to posthumously restore his US citizenship.
The motion filed in the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati alleged that the US government withheld a key FBI document that could have helped him in his bid to keep his citizenship. In 2011 the Associated Press had uncovered a secret 1985 FBI report which indicated that a Nazi ID card showing that Demjanjuk had served as a death camp guard was a Soviet-made fake. The bulk of the defense motion  was in regard to the government withholding that document along with an ongoing pattern of withholding other exculpatory materials.  The new suit claimed, however, that a matter does not rest on a singular document, but that "hundreds of files" recently declassified by a National Archives and Records Administration in Maryland could have aided Demjanjuk's efforts to recover US citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Michael|work=The Plain Dealer|date=13 April 2012|title=John Demjanjuk's widow asks for hearing on citizenship of late husband, convicted Nazi war criminal|accessdate=18 April 2012 |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2012/04/john_demjanjuks_widow_asks_for.html#comments}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On 28 June 2012, the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati ruled that Demjanjuk could not regain his citizenship posthumously. The three-judge panel said in its ruling that his death made the case moot, and that the appeal was without merit, given the court's 2004 decision that Demjanjuk's denaturalization should not be revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| agency= Associated Press| title= US court: No posthumous US citizenship for Demjanjuk, convicted in war crimes probe| date= 28 June 2012| access-date= 4 July 2012 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/us-court-no-posthumous-us-citizenship-for-demjanjuk-convicted-in-war-crimes-probe/2012/06/28/gJQA9lVC9V_story.html| work= [[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/12a0688n-06.pdf US v.

In early June 2012, Ulrich Busch, Demjanjuk's attorney,  filed a complaint with Bavarian prosecutors claiming that the pain medication Novalgin (known in the US as [[metamizole]] or dipyrone) that had been administered to Demjanjuk helped lead to his death.  Busch asked prosecutors to open an investigation of five doctors and a nurse on suspicion of manslaughter and causing bodily harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| agency= Associated Press| title= Demjanjuk attorney files complaint against doctors| date= 13 June 2012| access-date= 4 July 2012| url= http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/06/13/demjanjuk-attorney-files-complaint-against-doctors/ | publisher= Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The investigation was closed in November 2012 after no evidence emerged to support the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Doctors Did Not Hasten Demjanjuk's Death | date= November 27, 2012| url= http://www.jewishjournal.com/world/article/german_prosecutors_say_doctors_did_not_hasten_demjanjuks_death |work= [[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|Jewish Journal]] | publisher= TRIBE Media Corp.| access-date= June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central African Convention for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons, their Ammunition, Parts and Components that can be used for their Manufacture, Repair or Assembly''', also known as the '''Kinshasa Convention''', aims at regulating [[SALW|small arms and light weapons (SALW)]] and combating their illicit trade and trafficking in Central Africa.&lt;ref name="purpose"&gt;[[s:Central African Convention for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons, their Ammunition, Parts and Components that can be used for their Manufacture, Repair and Assembly#ARTICLE 1: PURPOSE|Kinshasa Convention - Chapter I, Article 1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa (UNSAC) was established by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] on 28 May 1992, pursuant to [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] resolution 46/37 B of 6 December 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/581/25/IMG/NR058125.pdf?OpenElement 46/37 Review and Implementation of the Concluding Document of the Twelfth Special Session of the General Assembly], [https://www.un.org/en/documents/ United Nations Documentation]&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary objective is to promote peace and security in Central Africa through confidence-building measures, notably in the fields of disarmament and arms limitation.&lt;ref name="reliefweb communique"&gt;[http://reliefweb.int/node/374648 Eleven Central African States to Sign New Convention on Control of Small Arms, Light Weapons, on 19 November], [http://reliefweb.int/ Relief Web]&lt;/ref&gt; UNSAC comprises the ten member States of the [[Economic Community of Central African States]] ([[Economic Community of Central African States|ECCAS]]) and the Republic of Rwanda.

In his statement opening the 25th ministerial meeting of UNSAC, in May 2007, the President of [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] invited the Committee to support the elaboration of a subregional legally binding instrument on illicit SALW and its accompanying implementation plan, in order to strengthen the capacity of Central African States to combat illicit small arms and light weapons and their governance of the security sector, as well as a Code of Conduct for the Defense and Security Forces in Central Africa. This proposal became known as the ''São Tomé Initiative''.&lt;ref name="report sg 2009"&gt;[http://disarmament.un.org/library.nsf/aeca18509aa92c5c852575610076cc98/ba28883d41f28c35852576150047436a/$FILE/A-64-163.pdf Regional confidence-building measures: activities of the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa, Report of the Secretary-General], [http://disarmament.un.org/library.nsf/ Disarmament Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central African Convention for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons, their Ammunition, Parts and Components that can be used for their Manufacture, Repair or Assembly''', dubbed Kinshasa Convention, was unanimously adopted on 30 April 2010 by all eleven member States of UNSAC at its 30th ministerial meeting held in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

The Convention was opened for signature on 19 November 2010 in the context of UNSAC's 31st ministerial meeting held in [[Brazzaville]], [[Republic of the Congo]]. Eight of the eleven UNSAC members States signed the Convention on this occasion; Burundi, Equatorial Guinea and Rwanda signed it shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="IRIN"&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportID=91158 CENTRAL AFRICA: New arms deal elicits optimism], [http://www.irinnews.org/ IRIN]&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention Implementation Plan, which was developed alongside the Convention to ensure the feasibility of the implementation process, was adopted at this occasion.

Following the ratification of the Convention by Angola on 6 February 2017, the sixth such instrument of ratification, the Kinshasa Convention will enter into force on 8 March 2017.&lt;ref name="ratification"/&gt;

==Analysis==

The Kinshasa Convention is the most recent small arms control and disarmament legal instrument elaborated within the United Nations framework.

This Convention, which addresses the security, legal, institutional and cultural specificities of the Central African subregion, demonstrates the eleven UNSAC countries' willingness to establish a coherent subregional strategy to act collectively against illicit arms and ammunition. The mobilization of the eleven Central African countries to negotiate this arms control and disarmament instrument contributes also to a significant confidence-building measure amongst countries, the majority of which had been at war with each other.

The Convention's scope is broad and takes into account the most recent developments in global and regional initiatives aimed at combating illicit small arms and light weapons. The Convention also draws upon the best practices and experience of the African and other regions. Its elaboration process was also unique to the extent that both the Convention and its implementation plan were carried out in parallel, with a view to ensuring a "reality check" at the conclusion of various legal provisions implying obligations for States to carry out specific measures.

The Ministers' direct involvement in the elaboration of the Kinshasa Convention and its adoption strengthens the importance of the Convention and constitutes a significant step towards a subregional coherent strategy to act against illicit arms and ammunition. The conclusion of such a significant and complex legal instrument in such a short period of time is a significant demonstration of the subregion's determination to tackle one of its biggest challenges.

This Convention fills a void as Central Africa was one of the African subregions not to have its own legal instrument for the control of small arms and light weapons.

'''Micro enterprise tax in Latvia''' — it is special tax regime. The law, regulating the tax, entered into force on 1-st, September, 2010 and name of the law is The law on micro enterprises tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=215302 The law on micro enterprises tax]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aim of the tax ==

Initially the tax was introduced with the aim to:
* facilitate the creation of new small businesses, 
* reduce bureaucracy and costs associated with starting a business, and
* facilitate the transition of business from the shadow (gray) market to the legal (white) market.

During that time (2009-2011) Latvia was struggling with the crisis, the unemployment rate was relatively high. The introduction of the tax on micro enterprises and other changes in legislation gave opportunity for enterprising people (including the unemployed) relatively simply and at low cost to start a business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delfi.lv/news/comment/comment/agnese-bicevska-mikrouznemuma-nodoklis-vai-mazs-cinitis-gazis-lielo-vezumu.d?id=38812939 Article of Agnese Bičevska about micro enterprise tax]&lt;/ref&gt;

But fairly quickly, many companies have begun to use this regime to reduce their taxes. So [[Saeima|Latvian parliament]] adopted legislation amendments. According to the amendments the application of this tax is very limited. 
Starting from 2016 application of the tax gradually decreases and from 1 January 2019 enterprises operating in most sectors (industries), will not be able to use the tax regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.company-taxes.info/related-information/changes-of-law-on-micro-enterprises-tax Changes of the Law on micro-enterprises tax.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== How to become a payer of the micro enterprises tax? ==
The following persons has rights to start a payer of the tax:
* a sole trader,
* an individual enterprise,
* agricultural or fishery enterprise,
* natural (private) person, that has registered economic activities with the State revenue service,&lt;ref&gt;[https://vid.gov.lv/?hl=2 State revenue service]&lt;/ref&gt;
* a limited liability company.

To become a payer of micro enterprises tax also must meet all the following criteria:
* all shareholders (if any) must be natural persons (owner of the shares of OOO automatically becomes an employee of the Company),
* turnover (income from economic activities) must not exceed EUR 100 000 per year,
* the number of employees must not exceed five employees,
* members of the board directors are employees of the company,
* natural or legal person is not a partner in a personal society,
* amount of salary of each employee does not exceed 720 euro per month,
* a person conducts business in certain (allowed) industries (enters into force on 1 January 2017).

List of sectors (industries) to which has no right to apply the regime of the micro-enterprise &lt;ref&gt;[http://m.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=277258 Regulation of the Cabinet of ministers]&lt;/ref&gt;

If a person owns shares in several companies, then only one company has the right to become a payer of micro enterprise tax.

If a person meets the above requirements, then to become a tax payer, must submit special application to the State Revenue Service. The application can be submitted using the Electronic declaration system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://eds.vid.gov.lv/login/ Electronic declaration system in Latvia]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Micro enterprise tax rate ==
For turnover not exceeding 7000 euros (per tax year), the tax rate is 9% of the turnover.

If the turnover is in the range of 7000.01 to 100 000 euros for the first, second and third year of operation, then the rate is also 9%.

However, starting from the fourth tax year, the rate increases to 12%.

Starting from 2017, the tax rate changes.

For turnover not exceeding 7000 euros (per tax year), the tax rate is 15% of the turnover.

If the turnover is in the range of 7000.01 to 100 000 euros for the first, second and third year of operation, then the rate is also 15%.

However, starting from the fourth tax year, the rate increases to 18%.

Additionally, the company must pay an additional tax - State Social Insurance Mandatory Contributions.

The '''Mongolian nationality law''' is a [[nationality law]] that determines who is a [[citizen]] of [[Mongolia]]. 

==Current law==
Current citizenship law is guided by the 1992 [[Constitution of Mongolia]] and, more importantly, the Law of Mongolia on Citizenship.&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Constitution of Mongolia |work= |publisher=[[Government of Mongolia]] |date=13 January 1992 |url=http://www.pmis.gov.mn/law/english/pdf/constitution_mongolia.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=20 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050508113815/http://www.pmis.gov.mn/law/english/pdf/constitution_mongolia.pdf |archivedate=May 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="japan"&gt;{{cite web

===Obtaining citizenship===
If both of the parents of a child are Mongolian - irrespective of where the child is born - then the child is automatically Mongolian. A child born to one Mongolian parent inside of Mongolia is also considered Mongolian.

A child who is within the territory of Mongolia whose parents are not identified is a Mongolian citizen.&lt;ref name="japan" /&gt; 

Foreigners may apply for citizenship through the President's office as well, or through a Mongolian embassy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opm.gov/EXTRA/INVESTIGATE/is-01.PDF |title=Citizenship Laws of the World |accessdate=2008-12-22 |date=March 2001 |publisher=United States Office of Personnel Management |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060404042127/http://www.opm.gov/extra/investigate/IS-01.pdf |archivedate=2006-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mongolians who are adopted by foreigners have "the right to choose his/her own nationality" according to the [[Family law of Mongolia]], Chapter 7, Article 58.9.&lt;ref&gt;Washington D.C.

Accessed 20 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before 1992, in the [[Mongolian People's Republic]], citizenship by birth was determined by the nationality of the parents.&lt;ref name="legalSystem"&gt;{{cite book

Before the [[fall of the Soviet Union|fall of]] [[the Soviet Union]], dual citizenship between the two countries was accepted. The statute was agreed upon by the [[Mongolian Council of Ministers]] on 30 December 1974, and detailed further by an Instruction on the Fulfillment of the Statute confirmed on 11 April 1975.&lt;ref name="legalSystem" /&gt;

==Loss of citizenship==
Citizenship can be renounced through the President's Office.&lt;ref name="citizenship"&gt;MultipleCitizenship.com. [http://www.multiplecitizenship.com/wscl/ws_MONGOLIA.html MONGOLIA]. Accessed 20 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Mongolian government has been historically unwilling to let educated Mongolians renounce their citizenship.&lt;ref name="unwilling"&gt;Tan, Vivian.

Accessed 20 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The involuntary loss of citizenship - exile - is banned under the constitution.&lt;ref name="constitution" /&gt;&lt;ref name="citizenship" /&gt;

The '''Pink Pistols''' are a [[gay]] [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]] organization in the United States and Canada. Their motto is "Pick on someone your own [[caliber]]".&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt;

==History==
Inspired by a [[Salon.com]] article written by [[Jonathan Rauch]],&lt;ref&gt;Rauch, Jonathan. "[http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2000/03/14/pistol/index.html?sid=681403 Pink Pistols]"  [[Salon (website)]] (March 14, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Krikket (aka Doug Krick), a [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] activist from [[Illinois]] while living in [[Massachusetts]], founded the Pink Pistols in July 2000. The organization had at least 45 chapters, as of October 2014.&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt; Those chapters are located in 33 states and three countries that are principally made up of gun-owning [[LGBT]] individuals, though neither status is mandatory for membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinkpistols.org Pinkpistols.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The political orientation of the Pink Pistols is considered unusual due to the popular perception in the United States of firearms ownership as a "[[Conservatism in the United States|conservative issue]]" and sexuality as a "[[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal issue]]". However, there is nothing within either of these two [[Single-issue politics|single issue]]s that is mutually exclusive and a variety of other pro-gun organizations exist for groups not typically associated with gun rights (for example, the "Democrats for the Second Amendment").&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Knute. [http://www.seattleweekly.com/2000-06-21/news/gays-amp-guns/ "Gays &amp; guns"], [[Seattle Weekly]] (October 9, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Pink Pistols' activities include [[Shooting range|firing range]] visits and [[political activism]]. The group occasionally produces report cards on politicians, rating their position on issues of interest to members. According to pinkpistols.org:

{{quotation|The Pink Pistols get together at least once a month at local firing ranges to practice shooting, and to acquaint people new to firearms with them. We will help you select a firearm, acquire a permit, and receive proper training in its safe and legal use for self-defense. The more people know that members of our community may be armed, the less likely they will be to single us out for attack.}}

The Pink Pistol's symbol consists of an overhead view of a [[Pictogram|picto-person]] aiming a [[handgun]] in an [[isosceles stance]] superimposed on a [[pink triangle]]. The pink triangle, now a [[gay pride]] and [[LGBT rights|gay rights]] symbol, was originally a [[Nazi concentration camp badges|badge]] that homosexual [[concentration camp]] victims were forced to wear during the [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|Holocaust]].

According to spokesperson Gwen Patton, "We don't want people to hurt us, we want people to run away from us, and the best way we have found to do that is to be armed."&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;McKay, Holly. "[http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/10/01/gay-gun-activists-growing-lgbt-push-to-support-second-amendment/ Gay gun activists: Growing LGBT push to support the Second Amendment]", [[Fox News]] (October 1, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  Patton has also stated that, "the Pink Pistols tend to get a better response from firearms supporters than from homosexuals".&lt;ref&gt;Marech, Rona. "[http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-Gay-group-defends-right-to-arms-2701776.php SAN FRANCISCO / Gay group defends right to arms / Pink Pistols oppose ballot issue backed by supervisors]", [[San Francisco Chronicle]] (February 3, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's membership increased from 1,500 to 4,500 in the week after the 2016 [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting|mass shooting at an Orlando, Florida gay nightclub]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/orlando-nightclub-massacre/lgbt-gun-rights-group-sees-membership-spike-after-orlando-shooting-n594701|title=LGBT Gun Rights Group Sees Membership Spike After Orlando Shooting|website=NBC News|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of June 24, 2016, the membership is over 7,000, and there are 36 chapters around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/06/23/483275198/lgbt-self-defense-site-pink-pistols-gains-followers-after-orlando-massacre|title=LGBT Self-Defense Site 'Pink Pistols' Gains Followers After Orlando Massacre|website=NPR|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group experienced a further rise in interest following [[Donald Trump]]'s election to the presidency later that year.&lt;ref name="trump"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-38297345|title=Why US liberals are now buying guns too}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2017, the group claimed a membership of over 9,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/texas-gun-lgbt-firearms-trump-1.4046334 |title=Trump 'gave hate groups a megaphone': Gun sales surge among LGBT, minorities in the U.S. |last=Kwong |first=Matt |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=2017-04-02 |accessdate=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12230">[[File:Window with prism tile transom.gif|thumb|upright |A prism transom bends light passing through the upper part of the window upwards.]]

'''Prism lighting''' is the use of [[prism]]s to improve the distribution of light in a space. It is usually used to distribute [[daylight]], and is a form of [[anidolic lighting]].

Prism lighting was popular from its introduction in the 1890s through to the 1930s, when cheap electric lights were commonplace and prism lighting became unfashionable. While mass production of prism lighting systems ended around 1940,&lt;ref name=nps/&gt; the 2010s have seen a revival using new materials.&lt;ref name=DoD/&gt;

==How it works==
The human eye's response to light [[Weber–Fechner law#Vision|is non-linear]]: halving the light level does not halve the perceived brightness of a space, it makes it look only slightly dimmer.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} If light is redistributed from the brightest parts of a room to the dimmest, the room therefore appears brighter overall, and more space can be given a useful and comfortable level of illumination (see before and after images from an 1899 article, below). This can reduce the need for artificial lighting.

[[Refraction]] and [[total internal reflection]] inside [[prism (optics)|optical prisms]] can bend beams of light. This bending of the light allows it to be redistributed.

Many small prisms may be joined at the edges into a sheet. A prism sheet is somewhat like a linear [[Fresnel lens]], but each ridge may be identical. Unlike a Fresnel lens, the light is not intended to be focussed, but used for [[anidolic lighting]].

&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="225"&gt;

Image:Scatter.gif|alt = A wedge of glass, in cross-section a right-angled triangle hung from the shortest side, with light passing downwards through the shortest side, hitting the hypotenuse, and bouncing out near-horizontally from the third side. The top of the wedge has ridges for setting it into a frame, and some of the light misses the wedge and continues downwards.|Single pendant prism from a [[vault light]], showing [[total internal reflection]]
Image:2angles.gif|alt = Two vertical tiles with one side of each serrated into prisms (the two sheets of prisms are differently shaped)|Two different prescriptions of prism tiles, showing their differing [[refraction]] of the light. The angle of the incoming light differs, but the outgoing angle of the outgoing light is the same (optimally, nearly horizontal&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;).
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Types==
[[Deck prisms]] carried light through the upper decks of ships and spread it in the decks below. Similarly, on land, prisms in [[sidewalk light]]s were used to light basements and vaults.

Prism tiles were used vertically, usually as a [[Transom (architectural)|transom]] light above a window or door.&lt;ref name=glassian/&gt; They were also built into fixed and movable canopies, sloped glazing, and [[skylights]]. They bend light upwards, so that it penetrates more deeply into the room, rather than lighting the floor near the window.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

Modern prismatic panels are essentially an acrylic version of the old glass prism tiles. Like glass tiles, they can be mounted on adjustable canopies.&lt;ref name=Santos&gt;https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/395139483932/Resumo-alargado-aluno-53255.pdf{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channel panels use slits that reflect light internally. [[Holographic optical element]]s can also be used to redirect light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2004.05.022 |title=Holographic optical elements: Various principles for solar control of conservatories and sunrooms |journal=Solar Energy |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=441–54 |year=2005 |last1=James |first1=P.A.B |last2=Bahaj |first2=A.S |bibcode=2005SoEn...78..441J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Santos /&gt;

[[Daylight redirecting film|Daylight redirecting window film]] (DRF) is a thin, flexible peel-and-stick sheet, with the optical layer generally made of acrylic. There are two types of film. Some film is moulded with tiny prisms, making a flexible peel-and-stick miniature prismatic panel. Other film is moulded with thin near-horizontal voids protruding into or through the acrylic; the slits [[total internal reflection|reflect]] light hitting their top surfaces upwards.&lt;ref name=TIR&gt;https://sweets.construction.com/swts_content_files/154130/2263001.pdf{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DoD/&gt; Refraction is minimized, to avoid colouring the light.&lt;ref name=DoD/&gt; The reflection-based films are more [[Transparency and translucency|transparent (both are translucent)]], but they tend to send the light up at the ceiling, not deeper into the room. Refraction-based films are translucent rather than transparent, but offer finer control over the direction of the outgoing light beam; the film can be made in a variety of prism shapes to refract light by a variety of angles.

==Manufacture and repair==
Older glass elements were cast, and might be cut and polished. Prism tiles were often made of single prisms joined with zinc, lead, or [[electroglazing|electroglazed]] copper strips (rather like the methods used to join traditional European [[stained glass]]).&lt;ref name=nps/&gt; [[Sidewalk prisms]] were cast in one piece as single or multiple-prism lenses, and inserted into load-bearing frames. Daylight redirecting film is made of [[acrylic resin|acrylic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://e3tnw.org/ItemDetail.aspx?id=513 Daylight Redirecting Window Film], Energy Efficiency Emerging Technologies.&lt;/ref&gt;

Damaged prism tiles may be repaired, and as they came in standard designs, there is a salvage market in replacements. Replacements for one-piece castings can be commissioned. Weakened prism tiles may be reinforced with hidden bars, much like those used to reinforce stained glass.&lt;ref name=nps/&gt;

==Architectural design==

 }}
Sophisticated systems for lighting different sorts of spaces with prism tiles were developed. Generally, the goal was to send the available light across the room nearly horizontally.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt; One company sold tiles with nine prescriptions, giving different [[angle of refraction|angles of refraction]].&lt;ref name=angles/&gt;&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt; Different prescriptions were often used in different parts of the same window transom, sometimes to disperse the light vertically, and sometimes to bend light horizontally around obstacles like pillars.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

Prisms tiles sometimes has elaborate artistic designs moulded into the outside; [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] famously created over forty prism tile designs.&lt;ref name=sheldon_munn&gt;[http://www.amestrib.com/news/20160928/renovation-of-sheldon-munn-uncovers-exciting-find Renovation of Sheldon Munn uncovers exciting find] Ames Tribune, Wednesday Sep 28, 2016 at 10:59 AM and 10:17 PM, by Michael Crumb&lt;/ref&gt;

Prism lighting works more effectively in light, open spaces.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt; Some believe that it contributed to the trend away from dark, subdivided Victorian interiors to open-plan, light-coloured ones.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The removal or covering of old prism transom lights often leaves characteristically tall signage spaces over shop windows (see pictures).

[[Daylight redirecting window film]] was initially made of one redirecting film and one glare-reducing diffusing film, often located on different interior surfaces of a double-glazed window,&lt;ref name=DoD/&gt; but integrated single films are now available.&lt;ref name=OOtM/&gt; Some daylight redirecting films reflect incoming light upwards off tiny near-horizontal reflectors, so at high sun angles they bend it sharply, throwing it upwards to the ceiling, where a typical ceiling [[Diffuse reflection|diffuses]] the daylight somewhat deeper into the space.&lt;ref name=TIR /&gt; Other daylight redirecting films refract light at any specified angle, ideally sending it nearly horizontally into the room. Redirecting films can be used as a substitute for opaque blinds.&lt;ref name=DoD/&gt;

The aim of the Harmony project is to develop templates of [[Contributor License Agreement]]s for use by [[Free and open source software]] (FOSS) projects.

The Canonical initiative was announced in June 2010 by Amanda Brock, General Counsel at Canonical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Our goal is to make the process of contributing to FOSS projects easier for developers regardless of who their employers are. We believe that standardised contribution agreements should serve this goal.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3200">A '''public instrument''' is any [[legal instrument]] (legal document) recorded with and authenticated by a public office or employee. To carry weight, any such instrument, must be genuine and authentic. Public instruments consequently must bear the name, title, and seal of the official that issued them, and should be written in the presence of witnesses who attested to them.&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Encyclopedia'', s.v. "proof", [html], retrieved 23 September 2009: [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

A public instrument is generally admissible in evidence without the necessity of preliminary proof of its authenticity and due execution.&lt;ref&gt;"Sicat vs Ariola Jr : AC 5864 : April 15, 2005 : Per Curiam : En Banc : Resolution", ''Judiciary of the Philippines'', [htm], retrieved 23 September 2009: [http://pmc.judiciary.gov.ph/test/dmdocuments/ac_5864.htm]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, public instruments are [[self-authenticating document|self-authenticating]] documentary evidence. A [[presumption of regularity]] and validity attaches to public instruments; for the instrument to be rebutted, it must be proven in court to contain a willful material error.

Typical types of public instruments include:
* State and federal laws
* Laws of foreign nations
* [[Vital record]]s
* Legislative acts
** Acts of [[statute]] ([[Act_of_Parliament|acts of Parliament]] or [[Act_of_Congress|Congress]])
** [[delegated_legislation_in_the_United_Kingdom|Subordinate legislation]]
* Judicial instruments
** Judgments, orders, and decrees
** Court writs or process
** Court records
** Rules of court
* [[Act_(document)|notarial acts]]
* Municipal and county charters
* Ordinances and resolutions of municipalities
* Administrative agency rules
* Items under official governmental seal
** [[Patent]]s, authentication certificates, [[apostille]]s, etc.
* Any deed or formal agreement recorded and filed with a government register or records office
** Title-deeds, conveyances, wills, company charters, public inventories, etc.

==Civil and Scots law==
Public instruments at [[civil_law_(legal_system)|civil law]] are generally known as '''public instruments''' (Germ: ''öffentliche Urkunde'', Fr: ''acte public'', Sp: ''instrumento público'') and under [[Scots law]] as '''probative''' or '''self-proving instruments'''.  These categories refer more to the level of evidenciary validity given an instrument in court.  Under these legal systems, to be received as a public instrument, a document must be subjected to a number of conditions. These include:
* Execution before two or more witnesses, or before an authorized civil-law notary or public officer
* Testified by a public seal
* Rendered public by the authority of a competent judicial officer
* Certified as a copy of a public register. 
Any such instrument is said to ''prove itself'', that is, it has the privilege of being free from challenge or rebuttal at court.

'''Rita Marie Lavelle''' (born 1946) is a [[United States]] and [[California|California State]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political figure. In 1984, Lavelle was convicted on federal charges of [[perjury]] related to an investigation into misuse of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s "[[Superfund]]" money during her tenure with the agency, and irregularities at the [[Stringfellow Acid Pits]], a major hazardous waste site. The Lavelle incident was labeled "Sewergate" or "Garbagegate" by the newspapers at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/524/000026446/ Michael Deaver]. nndb.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, Lavelle was convicted again on unrelated federal charges of one count of [[wire fraud]] and two counts of [[making false statements]] to the F.B.I. Lavelle committed these crimes in her NuTECH Enterprises, Inc. business of environmental consultation.

==Biography==
In 1969, Lavelle earned her bachelor's degree in Biology and Mathematics, with a minor in chemistry, from [[Holy Names University]] in [[Oakland, California]]. She continued her graduate work at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in physiological chemistry and stoichiometry. She earned a master's degree cum laude in business administration from [[Pepperdine University]] in 1980.

From 1969 to 1976, she was the [[California State Consumer Affairs Department]] information officer, state director of consumer education, and publications assistant in the office of then-Governor [[Ronald Reagan]]. She was director of marketing for Intercontinental and Continental Chemical Corporation in Sacramento, California, from 1976 to 1978. Lavelle's responsibilities included development of corporate guidelines to comply with the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]], a law that her later position at the EPA left her to administer nationwide compliance with by both business and government sectors. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Beginning in 1978, Lavelle initiated, directed and managed several programs for [[Aerojet-General Corporation]] subsidiaries; these included programs for divisions which manufactured chemicals and industrial and chemical intermediates, nuclear and chemical waste treatment systems, [[liquid rocket engines]] for the aerospace industry, and high-speed marine propulsion systems for defence applications.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

When Lavelle joined Aerojet-General Corporation, she became director of communications for one subsidiary, Cordova Chemical Co., until 1979, moving to a similar communications position for the largest subsidiary, Aerojet Liquid Rocket Co., in 1979.

In 1981, she was named one of the outstanding women in aerospace by ''Aerospace Magazine''.

On February 18, 1982, President [[Ronald Reagan]] announced his intention to nominate Lavelle for assistant administrator of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] for solid waste and emergency response. Her position included directing the hazardous waste control program and the $1.6 billion "[[Superfund]]" program which provides for the emergency cleanup of chemical spills and hazardous waste dumps.

EPA Administrator [[Anne Gorsuch]] described Lavelle as bringing "over 12 years of professional experience in state government and private industry to the agency", and went on to say that "she has demonstrated expertise in getting results, as shown by her record with the executive branch of government in California, with a mid-sized chemical firm and with a large diversified international corporation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Rita M. Lavelle |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |date=February 18, 1982 |url=http://www.epa.gov/history/admin/oswer/lavelle.htm |accessdate=June 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618104612/http://www.epa.gov/history/admin/oswer/lavelle.htm |archivedate=June 18, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lavelle had held several positions of responsibility in the California [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican Party]], including membership on the executive board of directors of California Federated Republican Women and the [[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento]] and [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] central committees.

==Superfund scandal==
Lavelle was indicted on federal perjury charges after an investigation was launched based on evidence submitted by another EPA employee, [[whistleblower]] [[Hugh Kaufman]]. The evidence showed that Lavelle was involved with misuse of the EPA's "Superfund" money&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/green-life/neil-gorsuch-s-family-has-checkered-history-when-it-comes-environmental-protection|title=Neil Gorsuch’s Family Has a Checkered History When It Comes to Environmental Protection|author=David Helvarg |date=February 1, 2017|website=sierraclub.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; during her tenure with the agency, and irregularities at the Stringfellow Acid Pits, a major hazardous waste site. In 1984, Lavelle was convicted of lying to the Congress and served three months of a six-month prison sentence, paid a $10,000 fine and was under probation for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shabecoff|first=Philip|date=January 10, 1984|title=Rita Lavelle gets 6-month term and is fined $10,000 for perjury|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|volume=|issue=|page=A1|id=|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/10/us/rita-lavelle-gets-6-month-term-and-is-fined-10000-for-perjury.html|accessdate=June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=May 25, 1987|title=Morality Among the Supply-Siders|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|volume=|issue=|page=3|id=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964451,00.html|accessdate= June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental conviction==
Lavelle and a partner owned NuTECH Enterprises, Inc., an [[environmental consulting]] firm in [[Oceanside, California]]. Lavelle and Robert V. Cole, a part owner of [[Denova Environmental, Inc.]], a [[hazardous waste]] storage facility in [[Rialto, California]], forged documents that purportedly bore the signature of Joseph Bertelli, the owner of Lemco Corporation in [[South Los Angeles]], to make it appear that Bertelli owed Cole's company more than $52,000 for the removal and storage of hazardous waste. Those documents were used to obtain $36,441 from Capital Partners USA, Inc. Only when Capital Partners attempted to collect from Bertelli did it realize that Bertelli had neither signed the documents nor agreed to the bill, and Denova had never removed hazardous waste for Lemco. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

On September 24, 2004, a jury in [[Los Angeles]] federal court found Lavelle guilty of one count of [[wire fraud]] and two counts of [[making false statements]] to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). Cole pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and was sentenced on December 16, 2004, to one year of probation and was ordered to pay a $3,000 fine. Lavelle was sentenced on January 10, 2005 to 15 months in federal prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title= Former E.P.A. official sentenced to federal prison for defrauding owner of Los Angeles HazMat site|publisher=United States Attorney's Office, Central District of California|date=January 10, 2005|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/cac/pressroom/pr2005/002.html|accessdate= November 18, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115172148/http://www.justice.gov/usao/cac/Pressroom/pr2005/002.html|archivedate=January 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rita Lavelle, [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] # 29753-112, was released on July 6, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/ Inmate Locator]."

The '''Services in the Internal Market Directive''' [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32006L0123 2006/123/EC] (also called the "'''Bolkestein Directive'''") is an [[European Union law|EU law]] aiming at establishing a [[single market]] for [[Service (economics)|services]] within the [[European Union]] (EU). Drafted under the leadership of the former [[European Commissioner|European Commissioner for the Internal Market]] [[Frits Bolkestein]], it has been popularly referred to by his name. It was seen as an important kick-start to the [[Lisbon Agenda]] which, launched in 2000, was an agreed strategy to make the EU "the world's most dynamic and competitive economy" by 2010.

The Bolkestein Directive was harshly criticised by left-wing European politicians, who stated that it would lead to competition between workers in different parts of Europe — hence the expression "[[Polish plumber]]" — resulting in [[social dumping]]. After the 2004 original draft had been substantially amended, the proposal was approved on 12 December 2006 by the European Parliament and Council, and adopted as the Directive 2006/123/EC.

==History==
===2004 original proposal: the three pillars===
Devised by the [[European Commission]] in March 2004, the first draft of the Services Directive propounded several important changes in the EU services market. Assuming every piece of regulation to be burdensome by default, the Directive required member states to justify all existing legislation on the grounds that it was non-discriminatory, necessary and proportional.

However, the changes proposed in the Directive would have not affected the professions, to which the rules of the country where the services are provided would continue to apply under the Directive on the Recognition of Diplomas. Nor, contrary to the popular belief that, for example, a [[Polish plumber]] could work in France under Polish [[labour law]]), would the changes have affected social legislation or health and safety at work (HSW). In these social fields the [[Posted Workers Directive|Posting-of-Workers Directive]] requires that short-term social protection, such as minimum wages and HSW, is governed by the rules of the country where the services are provided (the host country), while long-term benefits, such as pension and unemployment benefit contributions, remain with the country of origin (to which the posted workers returns after the service is over).

===Pros and cons===
====Arguments in favour of the original version====
Legally the Directive did not bring anything into EU law that was not already in the [[EC Treaty]] as interpreted by the Court of Justice. The "country of origin" principle had been gradually introduced into EU law on the freedom of movement of goods in the Cassis de Dijon case (1979) and into other areas, notably services and establishment, soon after. Secondary legislation cannot introduce rights and obligations that do not already have a basis in the Treaty. In this respect, the original draft of the Services Directive was not a novelty, but a clarification of the case law of the European Court of Justice, and a continuation of the "country of origin" principle, which had already been applied in the TV Without Frontiers Directive, the Second Banking Directive, the Third Insurance Directive, the E-Commerce Directive and others.

====Criticisms of the early draft====
[[File:Frits Bolkestein, 78.jpg|thumb|[[Frits Bolkestein]]]]
[[File:Bolkestein.gif|thumb|Protest against [[Frits Bolkestein]] in Brussels on March 19, 2005]]
[[File:CgtSyndicatBrussels.jpg|thumb|French and Belgian trade unions protesting against the directive in Brussels on 19 March 2005]]

The first version of the Bolkestein Directive provoked intense debate and mass protests in various EU countries, including [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]]. On 21 March 2005 nearly 100,000 people marched in [[Brussels]] to protest against the Directive. Critics argued that the Directive would erode many of the Member States' regulations governing industry and the environment, and would lead to competition between workers in different parts of Europe, resulting in a decline in income levels. The expression "[[Polish plumber]]" became famous during the French debate about the Directive, referring to the fear that under the Directive a Polish plumber would be able to work in France under Polish [[labour law]]s. Critics also charged that the Directive was a sign that "Anglo-Saxon" economic policy was running rampant over the EU and claimed that the Directive would inevitably lead to "[[social dumping]]" as companies and jobs were relocated to the lower-cost and less regulated economies of eastern Europe. They also claimed, falsely, that the Directive would have an adverse effect on social legislation and HSW (when, as mentioned above, it would have no effect on either).

===Developments during 2005===
On 22 March 2005 EU leaders agreed on a "far reaching" revision of the Directive to preserve the [[European social model]]. French President [[Jacques Chirac]] told an EU summit in Brussels that the changes planned by the Directive were "unacceptable". Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg declared: "If France wishes to eliminate the risk of social dumping, this will be addressed in the framework of the legislative procedure and of co-decision, which has been initiated." Modifications to the Directive were introduced at a later stage, in the normal course of the EU legislative process.

On 1 July 2005 the UK, which was in favour of the Directive, took the chair of the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|EU Presidency]]. In [[Tony Blair]]'s speech to the European Parliament on 23 June he committed the UK Presidency to try to "resolve some of the hard dossiers," of which the Services Directive was one. However, agreement was not achieved during its Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4698524.stm | work=BBC News | title=Q&amp;A: Services Directive | date=15 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentary amendments to the original version===

From 14 to 16 February 2006 a plenary session of the [[European Parliament]] carried out its [[first reading]] of the Directive in [[Strasbourg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stopbolkestein.org/index.cfm?Content_ID=1484657 |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nantes.indymedia.org/article.php3?id_article=7473 |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 February 2006 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] (Members of the European Parliament) voted 391-213 in favour of a proposed revision to the Directive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hix | first1 = Simon | last2 = Nourby | first2 = Abdul | title = After enlargement: voting patterns in the sixth European Parliament | journal = [[Legislative Studies Quarterly]] | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–174 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi= 10.3162/036298009788314282 | jstor = 20680234 | date = May 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.3162/036298009788314282 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/HixandNoury-LSQ-May09.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; although it had already been "watered down" from the original version read to the European Parliament on 14 February, so much so that [[Party of European Socialists|Socialist]] MEP [[Evelyne Gebhardt]] said that the Directive had been "turned upside down," a claim contested by labour organisations. The majority of members of the two largest groupings in the Parliament, the conservative [[European People's Party]] (EPP) and the centre-left [[Party of European Socialists]] (PES) voted in favour of the revised draft. The [[Party of the European Left]], the [[European Green Party]] and the [[French Socialist Party]] voted against the new revision. Meanwhile, about 50,000 people demonstrated against the "country of origin principle" in Strasbourg.

====Suggested inclusions====
The proposed Directive would have covered:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/innovation/services-internal-market/article-132241 |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Services of "[[general public interest]]" ([[public services]]), including, but not limited to, [[water]], [[sewage]] and [[waste]] management.
*Services provided to businesses, such as management consultancy, certification and testing, facilities management and advertising,
*Services provided both to businesses and to consumers, such as real estate agencies, construction services, architects, distribution services, car rental and travel agencies.
*Consumer leisure services such as tourism, sports centres and amusement parks.

====Suggested exclusions====
The following, however, would have been excluded:
*[[Broadcasting]],
*[[Gambling]]
*[[Employment agency|Temporary employment agencies]],
*[[Legal]] and [[social]] services,
*[[Mail|Postal]] and [[Audiovisual services]],
*[[Publicly-funded health care|Public health care]] (but not [[Private Healthcare|private health care]]),
*[[Public transport]]

The controversial "[[country of origin]]" principle was explicitly left out, but there was no "country of destination" principle to replace it. The [[European Court of Justice]] would therefore be charged with deciding, through its [[jurisprudence]], which country's [[labour law]]s would apply in each case.

===Comments on the amended draft===
====Proponents of liberalisation====
Business groups stated that the new Directive would limit the benefits that the early version of the Directive would have provided.

The European Commission estimated that this proposed version of the Directive would have created an additional 600,000 jobs in the EU, would have boosted economic growth, and would have increased product quality and choice for consumers.

The ''Wall Street Journal'' estimated that the revised Directive would have failed in its objective: the liberalisation of services at the heart of the EU.

D. Godefridi of the Hayek Institute wrote in ''[[le Figaro]]'': "Services represent 70% of the European economy. In not liberalising these the EU remains below the objective of the founding treaties of 1957: there is no common European market. For ten years European economic project has moved backwards. On 30 May 2006 the European political elite buried the very essence of the European project".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/debats/20060531.FIG000000250_directive_services_liberalisation_zero.html|title=?|author=|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125094039/http://www.lefigaro.fr/debats/20060531.FIG000000250_directive_services_liberalisation_zero.html|archivedate=25 November 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opponents of liberalisation====
Left-wing and labour organisations maintained that the new version of the Directive was not as favourable to workers as it was made out to be. There was also concern that the "country of origin" principle would most likely still be applied by the European Court of Justice, as previous jurisprudence seemed to suggest. In particular, it was pointed out that member states would be prohibited from applying any kind of restricted authorisation to businesses in the fields covered by the Directive, which would, they claimed, make administration of labour laws close to impossible.

===Final revision===
On 5 April 2006 the [[European Commission]] presented a new version of the Directive to the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]], including most of the modifications voted by the MEPs, in accordance with the [[codecision procedure]]. On 29 May 2006 the Council approved the revised text, which subsequently was resubmitted to the Parliament for its second and final reading.

==Approval and implementation==
The Directive, after being substantially amended from the original proposal, was adopted on 12 December 2006 by the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and the [[European Parliament]], and published on the [[Official Journal of the European Union]] on 27 December 2006 as the Directive 2006/123/EC. Therefore, the Directive on services in the internal market should have been completely implemented by the Member States by 28 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edilportale.com/news/2007/01/lavoro/servizi-nella-ue-pubblicata-la-direttiva_9145_33.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edilportale.com/normativa/direttiva-cee/2006/2006-123-ce/direttiva-del-parlamento-europeo-e-del-consiglio-relativa-ai-servizi-nel-mercato-interno-%28ex-bolkestein%29_9956.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euractiv.com/fr/europe-sociale/cedag-confusion-rgne-directive-services/article-184963&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the final version did not include the "country of origin" principle, the Directive instead reminded Member States of the principle of free movement, while accepting inroads when free movement collides with other public interests. However, before making such inroads, authorities have to verify and recognize any protection already provided in the country of origin - under the mutual recognition principle, they need to take into account what takes place in other countries before proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=2bc515ee-b254-42ef-94e9-143a4931249a&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation===
The Services Directive, which came into force on 28 December 2009, requires all EU Member States to establish web portals so that anyone who provides a service will have a "point of single contact" where they can find out what legal requirements they need to meet to operate in the country in question. Service providers can also use the web portals to apply for any licence or permit they need.

The Directive should make it easier for EU service providers to operate in any other EU Member State. The UK's [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] (Services Directive implementation team), working with marketing consultants, created the EUGO brand for use on point-of-single-contact portals across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/eu-go/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Supreme Judicial Council of Pakistan''' is a body of judges empowered under [http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part7.ch4.html Article 209] of the [[constitution of Pakistan]] to hear cases of misconduct against judges.

==Composition==
The composition of the Council is set out in the constitution as:

* The [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]]
* The two next most senior judges of the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]]
* The two most senior Chief Justices of the [[Provinces_of_Pakistan#Provinces_and_territories|provincial]] High Courts

Where the council is investigating a member of the council he is replaced by the next most senior judge.

==Powers==
No judge of any of the five High Courts or of the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] may be dismissed except by the [[President of Pakistan|President]] on the report of the Supreme Judicial Council. The Council may start proceedings against a judge either by its own initiative or by reference from the [[President of Pakistan]].

If the Council concludes that the judge is guilty of misconduct and should be removed from office they can recommend this to the President.

A judge of a court or tribunal subordinate to a High Court may be dismissed by the High Court concerned.

==Famous cases==
 {{See|Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry#SJC Hearings}}

In 2007, President [[Pervez Musharraf]] suspended Chief Justice [[Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry]] and referred him to the Council on charges of corruption. However, Chaudhry contested the ability of the Council to form without the Chief Justice himself present, and the Council hearing was suspended by the Supreme Court. Later Council's Verdict was that Council was not valid without Chief Justice as according to Constitution of Pakistan Supreme Judicial Council can not be Completed, Validated, or Proceed without "de jure" Chief Justice, No matter whoever may be "de facto" or "acting Chief Justice" is and provided that Nobody can file "Petition" against "de jure" Chief Justice (In this scenario Chief Justice Iftekhar M. Chauhdary himself). SO, Chief Justice, Mr:Chauhdary was restored and found not guilty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9048">An '''unaccompanied minor''' (sometimes "unaccompanied child" or "separated child") is a child traveling without the presence of a [[legal guardian]].

== Airline policy ==
In airline policy an unaccompanied minor is typically an airline passenger aged between 5 and 14 years old (airline regulations vary) who travels without an accompanying adult. Minors whose accompanying adult travels on the same flight but in a different [[Travel class|class]] may also be classified as unaccompanied minors.&lt;ref name="AirNZ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/children-travelling-alone-info|title=Children Travelling Alone|publisher=[[Air New Zealand]]|accessdate=13 July 2014|quote=For their safety children travelling in a different cabin to their caregiver are required to be classified as unaccompanied minors.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parent or guardian who requests for this service fills out a release form, identifying another guardian who will pick up the minor at the destination airport. Airline personnel are responsible for escorting the child through immigrations and customs and boarding the flight in time.  A fee may be payable for this service.

During the flight, no special attention is given to the minor until the flight enters final descent to the destination. On descent, the minor is moved to the nearest exit, which could be in business or first class, so that he or she can leave the aircraft at first opportunity and be transferred to the local ground staff. After clearing immigrations and customs, the child is released only to the adult identified on the paperwork.

Some airlines have controversial [[Airline sex discrimination policy controversy|unaccompanied minor seating policies]] which discriminate against adult male passengers on the basis of gender. The policies bar unaccompanied minors from being seated next to adult males and have led to significant criticism and successful legal action.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11061577 BA changes child seating policy following court case] BBC News, 23 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10401416 BA compensates man 'humiliated' over child seat policy] BBC News, 24 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Some airlines, including [[Ryanair]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ryanair.com/en/terms-and-conditions/regulations-childreninfantsyoung/|title=Children, Infants and Young Persons|publisher=Ryanair|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; will not carry unaccompanied minors.

[[File:USMC reelistment cermony.ogv|thumb|A Marine re-enlists in the Marine Corps taking the Oath of Enlistment]]

The '''oath of enlistment''' is a military oath made by members of the United States armed forces who are not commissioned officers.

==Description==
Upon [[Enlisted rank|enlisting]] in the [[United States Armed Forces]], each person enlisting in an armed force (whether a [[United States Army|soldier]], [[United States Navy|sailor]], [[United States Coast Guard|coast guardsman]], [[United States Air Force|airman]], or [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]]) takes an ''oath of enlistment'' required by federal [[statute]] in {{usc|10|502}}. That section provides the text of the oath and sets out who may administer the oath:

{{quotation|§ 502. Enlistment oath: who may administer&lt;br&gt;
(a) '''Enlistment Oath'''.— Each person enlisting in an armed force shall take the following oath:&lt;br&gt;
"I, (state name of enlistee), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the [[Constitution of the United States]] against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] appointed over me, according to regulations and the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]. [[So help me God]]."&lt;br&gt;

(b) '''Who May Administer'''.— The oath may be taken before the President, the Vice-President, the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], any commissioned officer, or any other person designated under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.}}

Army Regulation 601-210, Active and Reserve Components Enlistment Program provides that:

{{quotation|A commissioned officer of any service will administer the Oath of Enlistment in DD Form 4 orally, in English, to each application. Make a suitable arrangement to ensure that the oath is administered in a dignified manner and in proper surroundings. display the [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]] prominently near the officer giving the oath. The words "So help me God" may be omitted for persons who desire to affirm rather than to swear to the oath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/r601_210.pdf |title=Army Regulation 601-210, Active and Reserve Components Enlistment Program |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=10 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617004410/http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/r601_210.pdf |archivedate=17 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is no duration defined in the Oath itself. The term of service for each enlisted person is written on the DD Form 4 series, the contract which specifies the enlistment period, which for a first-time enlistee is typically four or six years, which can be a combination of [[active duty]] and time spent in a [[Reserve components of the United States armed forces|reserve component]], although enlisted reservists are subject to activation until the end of the eight-year initial military obligation.

Officers do not take the same oath as enlisted personnel, instead taking a similar [[United States Uniformed Services Oath of Office]].&lt;br&gt;

Navy personnel will reenlist using form NAVPERS 1070/601 (Rev.9-99) printed from Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS).

The '''Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990''' ('''VARA'''), {{UnitedStatesCode|17|106A}}, is a [[United States]] law granting certain rights to artists.

VARA was the first federal [[United States Copyright law|copyright]] legislation to grant protection to ''[[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]]''. Under VARA, works of art that meet certain requirements afford their authors additional rights in the works, regardless of any subsequent physical ownership of the work itself, or regardless of who holds the copyright to the work. For instance, a painter may insist on proper attribution of his painting, and in some instances may sue the owner of the physical painting for destroying the painting even if the owner of the painting lawfully owned it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703447004575449793518169052|title=When Creator and Owner Clash|first=Daniel|last=Grant|date=31 August 2010|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although federal law had not acknowledged moral rights before this act, some state legislatures and judicial decisions created limited moral-rights protection. The [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] required the protection of these rights by signatory states, and it was in response that the U.S. Congress passed the VARA.

==Exclusive rights under VARA==
VARA exclusively grants authors of works that fall under the protection of the Act the following rights
*right to claim authorship
*right to prevent the use of one's name on any work the author did not create
*right to prevent use of one's name on any work that has been distorted, mutilated, or modified in a way that would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation
*right to prevent distortion, mutilation, or modification that would prejudice the author's honor or reputation

Additionally, authors of works of "recognized stature" may prohibit intentional or grossly negligent destruction of a work. Exceptions to VARA require a waiver from the author in writing. To date, "recognized stature" has managed to elude a precise definition. VARA allows authors to waive their rights, something generally not permitted in France and many European countries whose laws were the originators of the moral rights of artists concept.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Sherman. Note: THE VISUAL ARTISTS RIGHTS ACT OF 1990: AMERICAN ARTISTS BURNED AGAIN. 17 Cardozo L. Rev. 373 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In most instances, the rights granted under VARA persist for the life of the author (or the last surviving author, for creators of joint works).

===Covered works===
VARA provides its protection only to [[paintings]], [[drawings]], [[Printmaking|prints]], [[sculptures]], [[Photograph|still photographic images]] produced for exhibition only, and existing in single copies or in limited editions of 200 or fewer copies, signed and numbered by the artist. The requirements for protection do not implicate aesthetic taste or value.

==Application and effect==
VARA's application is limited to visual works that fall within a narrowly defined category. However, for works that do fall within the category of protected works, VARA imposes substantial restrictions on any modification or removal of those works. Purchasers of the works must obtain written waivers from the author if they wish to exercise any of the exclusive rights under VARA.

This has particularly been an issue for those that commission public sculptures. Absent a waiver, artists could effectively veto decisions to remove their structures from their benefactor's land. In a 2006 decision involving public sculptures that were removed from the park for which they were created, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] ruled that VARA does not protect location as a component of site-specific work.  VARA covered works can be moved as long as the move does not constitute "destruction, distortion, or mutilation."&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''Phillips v. Pembroke Real Estate, Inc.'', 459 F.3d 128 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|1st Circuit]] 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of works==
*[[Tilted Arc]], a well-known artwork by [[Richard Serra]], was removed from public display prior to the enactment of VARA.
*[[Kent Twitchell]]'s [[Ed Ruscha]] [[mural]] was painted over without his approval.  Twitchell agreed to the largest settlement ever under VARA for $1.1 million against the U.S. government and 12 defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/13/us/5pointz-graffiti-artists-award-trnd/index.html|title=Judge awards $6.7 million to graffiti artists whose work was destroyed to build condos|last=CNN|first=Laura Ly,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/06/27/417204222/what-right-do-muralists-have-to-the-buildings-they-paint-on|title=What Right Do Muralists Have To The Buildings They Paint On?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On February 12, 2018, a federal judge cited VARA in awarding $6.7 million to 21 graffiti artists at the [[5 Pointz]] open-air graffiti museum whose works were destroyed by the developer who owned the property on which the graffiti had been painted.

The '''Publicly Owned Enterprise''' ({{lang-de|Volkseigener Betrieb}}; abbreviated '''VEB''') was the main legal form of industrial enterprise in [[East Germany]]. They were all publicly owned and were formed after [[Nationalisation#Germany|mass nationalisation]] between 1945 and the early 1960s, and the handing back in 1954 of some 33 enterprises previously taken by the [[Soviet Union]] as [[War reparations|reparations]].

The managing director of a VEB was called a plant or works manager (German: ''Werkleiter'', ''Werkdirektor'' or ''Betriebsdirektor''). He or she was assisted by the first secretary of the factory party organisation (''Betriebsparteiorganisation'') of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]], and the chairman of the factory trade union (''Betriebsgewerkschaftsleitung''). Subordinate to them were roles such as "Chief Accountant" and "Technical Director".

VEBs were initially [[vertical integration|vertically integrated]] into units called Associations of Publicly Owned Enterprises (''Vereinigung Volkseigener Betriebe'', VVBs). A VVB existed in most major industries, to consolidate production and reduce waste. They had all been replaced by 1979 with the ''[[Combine (enterprise)|VEB Kombinate]]'', or VEB Group, which integrated the VEBs much more closely than the largely administrative VVBs. Under this system, the term 'Kombinate' was frequently dropped and the term "VEB" usually implied the group rather than the individual factory. The organisation of all state enterprises was the responsibility of the State Planning Commission.

VEBs often had company sports teams, and played an important role in the promotion of sports.

In 1989, VEBs employed 79.9% of the East German workforce. After [[German reunification]] and the introduction of the market economy in 1990, the ownership of around 8,000 publicly owned enterprises passed to [[Treuhand]], the [[Trust company|trust agency]] which oversaw the privatization of GDR state property.

An honorary name was frequently added to the firm's actual name, for example, VEB Kombinat Chemische Werke "[[Walter Ulbricht]]" [[Leuna]]. This was a [[socialist emulation]] incentive towards fulfillment and overfulfillment of production quotas. Many Germans, as a form of mild protest against the nationalization of private businesses, nicknamed the VEBs ''Vati's ehemaliger Betrieb'', which translates to "Daddy's old business".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = „VEB-GmbH“: „Vatis ehemaliger Betrieb — geklaut mit besonderer Höflichkeit“.

The '''Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century''' is a [[United States federal law]], signed on April 5, 2000, seeking to improve [[airline]] safety.  It is popularly called '''"AIR 21,"''' and is also known as Public Law 106-181.

==Background==

On 11 September 1991, [[Continental Express Flight 2574]], an '''Embraer''' EMB 120 Brasilia carrying 14 people, crashed as it was approaching [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport|Intercontinental Airport]] in [[Houston, Texas]], killing all 14 people on board.

The [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) investigation revealed that screws had been removed from the horizontal stabilizer during maintenance the night before the accident and, following a shift change, the screws were not replaced.

NTSB cited the failure of airline maintenance and inspection personnel to adhere to proper maintenance and quality assurance procedures. The failure of [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) surveillance to detect and verify compliance with approved procedures was cited as a contributing factor.

Some months after, the same airline had a similar incident when a plane was forced to return to the airport after bolts had been removed from a wing panel. NTSB decried that even a fatal accident and an FAA NASIP inspection weren't enough to overcome what appears to have been corporate culture.

According to Meshkati (1997), the crash of [[Continental Express]] Flight 2574 was the most dramatic turning point for "[[safety culture]]" in the United States.[http://www.aviation.uiuc.edu/UnitsHFD/TechPdf/02-3.pdf] As a member of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) at that time, Dr. John Lauber suggested that the probable cause of this accident included "The failure of Continental Express management to establish a corporate culture which encouraged and enforced adherence to approved maintenance and quality assurance procedures" (NTSB/AAR-92/04, 1992, pg. 54, as cited in Meshkati, 1997). As a result of this and other similar aviation accidents, safety culture came to the forefront as the exclusive topic at the U.S. National Summit on Transportation Safety, hosted by the NTSB in 1997.

==Enactment==
AIR 21 was known as H.R. 1000 in 106th Congress, second session. [[Bud Shuster|Rep. Bud Shuster]] (R-Pa.) introduced it on 4 March 1999.  It was enacted on 5 April 2000.  Upon signing the bill into law, [[U.S. President|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This bill contains many new provisions to advance aviation safety. Of particular note is the inclusion of the "Aircraft Safety Act of 1999," which my Administration proposed to help stop the indefensible practice of manufacturing, distributing, and installing fraudulently represented, nonconforming aircraft parts. Several significant provisions to provide "whistleblower" protections to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and air industry employees, to close a potential loophole in the prosecution of hazardous materials cases, and to combat "air rage" incidents in flight, will also address real safety concerns we face today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=58334 Statement on Signing the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Safety provisions==
AIR 21 set requirements for safety equipment for specific aircraft, added consumer and employee protection provisions, and imposed new requirements for commercial air tour operations over national parks.

Title V established civil penalties for individuals who interfere with or jeopardize the safety of a cabin crew or other passengers. This provision seeks to deter "air rage."

Section 507 modified the sanction for transporting hazardous materials by removing the requirement that the person have knowledge of the regulation related to the transportation of hazardous materials.  However, it permits consideration of lack of knowledge in mitigation of the penalty.  This requirement is at 49 U.S.C. 46312.

Section 401 of the bill prohibited a state or local government from preventing people associated with disaster counseling services who are not licensed in that state from providing those services for up to 60 days after an aviation accident. Section 402 of the bill would expand a current preemption of state liability laws by limiting the liability of air carriers that provide information concerning flight reservations to the families of passengers involved in airline accidents. Air carriers are already provided immunity from state liability laws for providing passenger lists under these circumstances. Because neither mandate would require state or local governments to expend funds or to change their laws, CBO estimates that any costs associated with these mandates would be insignificant.

In Section 725, the act required the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] to contract with the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] for an independent study of the air quality in passenger cabins.

==Consumer protections==
Title II sought to improve consumer access in all regions of the United States, including those in small communities and rural and remote areas, to affordable, regularly scheduled air service.

Section 221 made it an unfair or deceptive practice for any air carrier, or ticket agent utilizing electronically transmitted tickets for air transportation to fail to notify the purchaser of such a ticket of its expiration date.  It did so by amending 49 U.S.C. 41712(b).

Section 224 required airlines to file individual customer service plans with the Secretary of Transportation.

Title IV made the [[Death on the High Seas Act]] (DOHSA) inapplicable to aviation incidents, thereby broadening the circumstances under which relatives can seek compensation for the death of a family member in an aviation incident over the ocean.

AIR 21 also includes a legislative advance for air travelers with disabilities.

==Financial provisions==
The [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated that AIR 21 would result in additional outlays totaling about $56&amp;nbsp;billion over the 2000-2004 period.[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/1?&amp;sid=cp106G5jeT&amp;hd_count=2&amp;xform_type=3&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=hr167p2.106&amp;db_id=106&amp;item=1&amp;sel=TOC_0&amp;]

Title I authorized the appropriation of $47.6&amp;nbsp;billion for FAA operations, facilities, and equipment for fiscal years 2000 through 2004. Title I also provided $19.2&amp;nbsp;billion in contract authority for the FAA's airport improvement program for fiscal years 2000 through 2004.  It provided an additional $7.1&amp;nbsp;billion in contract authority for the airport improvement program (AIP) over the 2000-2004 period (above the $2.4&amp;nbsp;billion a year assumed in the baseline).  It allowed airports to charge higher passenger facility fees.

AIR 21 took the [[Airport and Airway Trust Fund]] (AATF) off-budget and exempted AATF spending from the discretionary spending caps, pay-as-you-go procedures, and Congressional budget controls.[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/1?&amp;sid=cp106G5jeT&amp;hd_count=2&amp;xform_type=3&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=hr167p2.106&amp;db_id=106&amp;item=1&amp;sel=TOC_0&amp;]
This provision was a goal of the [[AOPA#The Nineties to Present|Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association]] which sought to unlock the aviation trust fund.

Title VII extended the war risk insurance program and prohibited the FAA from charging fees for certain services. This title provided that, of the amounts appropriated for FAA operations in fiscal year 2000, $2&amp;nbsp;million may be used to eliminate a backlog of [[Equal Opportunity Employment|equal employment opportunity]] complaints at the Department of Transportation (DOT).

==Employee protections==
Title VI provided [[whistleblower]] protection for employees of air carriers who notify authorities that their employer is violating a federal law relating to air carrier safety. The bill set up a complaint and investigation process within the Department of Labor (DOL).  The time limit for employees to make such complaints in writing to the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] is 90 days from the date of each adverse employment action.[http://www.workplacefairness.org/air21]

==Public Availability of Airmen Records==
Section 715, "Public Availability of Airmen Records", allows the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] to release the names, addresses, and ratings held by nearly all pilots with a medical certificate. This includes the release of information to private businesses, including those not necessarily having any relation to aviation safety (the intent of the bill). The FAA must notify airmen of this clause via mail and notify them that they have 90 days to opt out of the inclusion of their personal information into the public record. If no action is taken within 90 days, then an opt-in is assumed.&lt;ref&gt;Airmen Certification: Public Availability of Airmen Records (Federal Aviation Administration) [http://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/airmen_certification/hr1000/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Zubik v. Burwell''''' (2016) is a case before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] on whether [[religious institutions]] other than churches should be exempt from the [[contraceptive mandate]], a regulation adopted by the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) under the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA) that requires non-church employers to cover certain contraceptives for their female employees. Churches are already exempt under those regulations.&lt;ref name=nyt20160323&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/24/us/politics/supreme-court-case-on-contraceptives-mandate-may-offer-little-closure.html Justices Seem Split in Case on Birth Control Mandate], Adam Liptak, New York Times, March 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, 2016, the Supreme Court vacated the Court of Appeals ruling in ''Zubik v. Burwell'' and the six cases it had consolidated under that title and returned them to their respective courts of appeals for reconsideration.

==Background==

===Federal law===
[[File:EBSA-Form-700 January 2014.pdf|thumb|300px|[[EBSA Form 700]], version as of January 1, 2014]]

====Religious Freedom Restoration Act====
The United States Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'' (1990) that a person may not defy "neutral laws of general applicability"{{efn|The meaning of "neutral law of general applicability" was [[Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah|elaborated by the court in 1993]].}} even as an expression of religious belief. "To permit this," wrote Justice Scalia, citing the 1878 ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'' decision, "would make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://web.utk.edu/~scheb/decisions/Reynolds.htm|title = REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES United States Supreme Court 98 U.S. 145, 25 L.Ed. 244 (1878)|date = 1878|accessdate = September 2, 2015|website = |publisher =}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that generally applicable laws do not have to meet the standard of [[strict scrutiny]], because such a requirement would create "a private right to ignore generally applicable laws". Strict scrutiny would require a law to be the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest.

In 1993, the U.S. Congress responded by passing the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (RFRA), requiring strict scrutiny when a neutral law of general applicability "substantially burden[s] a person's{{efn|The [[Dictionary Act]] defines the word 'person' in any act of Congress to include corporations.}} exercise of religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|title=Supreme Court Hears Cases on Contraception Rule|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/us/politics/q-and-a-on-challenges-to-health-laws-birth-control-requirement.html |accessdate=March 25, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RFRA was amended in 2000 by the [[Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act]] (RLUIPA) to redefine ''exercise of religion'' as any exercise of religion, "whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief", which is to be "construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter and the Constitution". The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the RFRA as applied to federal statutes in ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita]]'' in 2006.

====Affordable Care Act====
Most Americans are covered by [[Private Option|employer-sponsored]] health insurance. In 2010, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA), which relies on the [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] (HRSA), part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to specify what kinds of preventive care for women should be covered in certain employer-based health plans. The HRSA decided that all twenty contraceptives approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) should be covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A statement by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius|url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/01/20120120a.html|work=HHS.gov|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers that refuse are fined $100 per individual per day,&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|last=Mears|first=Bill|title=Justices to hear 'Hobby Lobby' case on Obamacare birth control rule|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/21/politics/scotus-obamacare-contraception-mandate/|accessdate=March 25, 2014|newspaper=CNN|date=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or they can replace their health coverage with higher wages and a calibrated tax.

HHS exempted churches (including houses of worship, such as synagogues and mosques) and their integrated auxiliaries, associations of churches, and any religious order that engages exclusively in religious activity. These are the same groups exempt from filing IRS [[Form 990]]. Employers providing grandfathered plans (plans that have not had specific changes before March 23, 2010), and employers with fewer than 50 employees were also exempt. Other non-profit organizations that object to any required contraception coverage could file an [[EBSA form 700]] with their insurance company notifying them of the non-profit's objection. The insurance company would then provide the contraceptive coverage directly to employees without any involvement of the employer, including any distribution of literature or extra payments by the employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High court worsens pain of Obamacare birth-control compromise|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-wp-blm-news-bc-health-contraceptives01-20140701,0,3865443.story|accessdate=July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial litigation===
The [[Little Sisters of the Poor]], a Roman Catholic religious order, runs over 25 homes for low-income elderly in the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.littlesistersofthepoor.org/locations/u-s-homes Little Sister Directory of Homes] accessed March 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore is not automatically exempt from the contraceptive mandate. It objected to filing Form 700 because it believed that doing would make the order complicit in providing contraception, a sin under [[Humanae vitae|Roman Catholic doctrine]]. On December 31, 2013, the day before the filing requirement was to come into effect, Supreme Court Justice [[Sonya Sotomayor]] granted a temporary injunction to the Little Sisters of the Poor, allowing them to simply inform the Secretary of Health and Human Services of their objections, pending resolution of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bazelon|first1=Emily|title=Did Little Sisters of the Poor Win or Lose at the Supreme Court?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/01/little_sisters_of_the_poor_case_supreme_court_grants_a_temporary_reprieve.single.html|accessdate=July 6, 2014|work=Slate|date=Jan 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/012414zr_6jgm.pdf |format=PDF |title=Order in Pending Case : Little Sister of the Poor vs. Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Servcies, et al |website=Supremecourt.gov |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/13A691-Little-Sisters-v-Sebelius-Order.pdf |format=PDF |title=Little Sister of the Poor vs. Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Servcies, et al |website=Becketfund.org |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other religious institutions filed similar objections.

On February 15, 2012, ''Priests for Life v. HHS''  was filed in the [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] challenging the constitutionality of the contraceptive mandate on behalf of [[Priests for Life]], a national, Catholic, pro-life organization based in [[New York City]]. The case was dismissed by U.S. District Court Judge [[Frederic Block]] for lack of ripeness because the new compromise regulations were not yet finalized.&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jeffrey|first=Don|title=Priests for Life's Contraceptive Mandate Suit Dismissed|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=April 15, 2013|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-15/priests-for-life-s-contraceptive-mandate-suit-dismissed.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanfreedomlawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Opening-Brief-Filed.pdf |format=PDF |title=Priests For Life, et al vs. U.S. Department of healthj and Human Services, et al |website=Americanfreedomlawcenter.org |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/supreme.court.to.hear.nuns.complaint.on.obamacare.contraceptive.mandate/69923.htm|title=Supreme Court to hear nuns' complaint on Obamacare contraceptive mandate - Christian News|publisher=Christian Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 in ''[[Burwell v. Hobby Lobby]]'' that under the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (RFRA), closely held for-profit corporations are exempt from the contraceptive mandate, if they object on religious grounds, because the accommodation offered to objecting non-profits would be a less restrictive way to achieve the ACA's interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Supreme Court of the United States: Syllabus: BURWELL, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, ET AL. v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC., ET AL.|publisher=Supremecourt.gov|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 2014, the Supreme Court granted a temporary exemption to the approach it suggested as a less restrictive alternative in ''Hobby Lobby,'' where the plaintiffs would send an EBSA Form 700 to its insurance issuer, which would pay for the contraception. In an unsigned emergency injunction for [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] in Illinois, the court said that instead of notifying its insurance issuer, Wheaton can notify the government. Once notified, the government should notify the issuer. Wheaton believed that by transferring the obligation to cover contraceptives to its insurance issuer, it was triggering that obligation. The emergency injunction does not constitute a ruling on the merits of Wheaton's religious objection. The court said "Nothing in this interim order affects the ability of the applicant's employees and students to obtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved contraceptives."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13a1284_ap6c.pdf Order in Pending Case, Wheaton College v. Bruwell, On Application for Injunction], July 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In a 15-page dissent, joined by the other two female jurists on the court, Justice Sotomayor criticized the majority's reasoning and distinguished it from the situation with the Little Sisters of the Poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|title=Birth Control Order Deepens Divide Among Justices|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/04/us/politics/supreme-court-order-suspends-contraception-rule-for-christian-college.html|accessdate=July 3, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised version of EBSA Form 700, effective August 2014, says "[a]s an alternative to using this form, an eligible organization may provide notice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that the eligible organization has a religious objection to providing coverage for all or a subset of contraceptive services..."

Eight appeals courts upheld the ACA mandate for non-church religious institutions. Only the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled the other way, upholding the challenge by religious non-profit institutions in September 2015 in two cases, ''Sharpe Holdings v. HHS'' and ''Dordt College v. Burwell''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnes|first1=Robert|title=Ruling sets up new review of religious objections to contraceptive mandate| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/ruling-sets-up-new-review-of-religious-objections-to-contraceptive-mandate/2015/09/17/bac4c13e-5d64-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html|accessdate=May 17, 2016|work=Washington Post|date=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oral arguments===
Oral arguments were heard on March 23, 2016. Issues discussed included how and where to draw the line between exempt churches and other religious non-profits and whether the government was "hijacking" the insurance plans created by the non-profits to achieve the government's goals. Because of Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]'s death in February, only eight justices heard the arguments, raising the possibility of an equally divided court, which would leave the appeals court rulings in force in their respective jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="nyt20160323" /&gt;&lt;ref name=singleword&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/03/argument-analysis-on-new-health-care-case-a-single-word-may-tell-it-all/ |title=Argument analysis: On new health care case, a single word may tell it all |first=Lyle | last= Denniston |publisher=Scotusblog |date= March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=U.S. Supreme Court|accessdate=  May 17, 2016|title= Proceedings [Transcript] | url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-1418_j4ek.pdf | date = March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supplemental briefing===
On March 29 in  a highly unusual move, the Court directed the parties "to file supplemental briefs that address whether and how contraceptive coverage may be obtained by petitioners' employees through petitioners's insurance companies, but in a way that does not require any involvement of petitioners beyond their own decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage to their employees." The Court suggested a possible scheme where petitioners would obtain insurance without contraceptive coverage and "petitioners' insurance company, aware that petitioners are not providing certain contraceptive coverage on religious grounds, would separately notify petitioners' employees that the insurance company will provide cost-free contraceptive coverage, and that such coverage is not paid for by petitioners and is not provided through petitioners's health plan."&lt;ref name="Zubik v. Burwell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Asam|title=Supreme Court Hints at Way to Avert Tie on Birth Control Mandate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/us/politics/supreme-court-hints-at-way-to-avert-tie-on-birth-control-mandate.html?_r=0|accessdate=May 17, 2016|work=New York Times|date=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, of particular interest to the court was the question raised in an amicus brief of conscientious objection suggesting that courts may not usurp the right of religious adherents to determine their own views regarding moral complicity.&lt;ref&gt;http://s3.amazonaws.com/becketpdf/Anglican-Chaplains-and-Ave-Maria-University-LSP-Amicus.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruling===
On May 16, 2016, the Court issued a [[per curiam decision]] that vacated the decisions of the Circuit Courts of Appeals and remanded the cases to those courts for reconsideration in light of the "positions asserted by the parties in their supplemental briefs".&lt;ref&gt;''Zubik v. Burwell'', No. 14–1418, 578 U.S. ___, slip op. at 3, 5 (2016) (per curiam).&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Petitioners agreed that "their religious exercise is not infringed where they 'need to do nothing more than contract for a plan that does not include coverage for some or all forms of contraception'", the Court held that the parties should be given an opportunity to clarify and refine how this approach would work in practice and to "resolve any outstanding issues".&lt;ref&gt;''Zubik'', slip op. at 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; In a departure from the usual treatment of per curiam rulings, Chief Justice [[John Roberts|Roberts]] read the ruling aloud in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date = May 16, 2016 | accessdate = May 16, 2016 | title = Justices Tell Lower Courts to Craft Compromise for Contraceptive Insurance | url=  http://m.nationallawjournal.com/#/article/1202757726631/Justices-Tell-Lower-Courts-to-Craft-Compromise-for-Contraceptive-Insurance | work = National Law Journal | first1= Tony| last1= Mauro | first2 = Martha | last2= Coyle }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court expressed "no view on the merits of the cases."&lt;ref&gt;''Zubik'', slip op. at 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In a concurring opinion, Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]], noted that in earlier cases "some lower courts have ignored those instructions" and cautioned lower courts not to read any signals in the Supreme Court's actions in this case. She cited as an example the Eighth Circuit opinion in ''Sharpe Holdings'', the only Court of Appeals decision that had upheld the position taken by the ''Zubik'' plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;''Zubik'', slip op. at 2-3 (Sotomayor, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further litigation==
On May 23 the Supreme Court returned two additional cases back to their respective Courts of Appeals for reconsideration in light of the filings in ''Zubik'': ''Catholic Healthcare System v. Burwell'' (Second Circuit Court of Appeals) and ''Michigan Catholic Conference v. Burwell'' (Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | accessdate = May 24, 2016 | date = May 23, 2016 | title = remands two HHS challenges to lower courts 'in light of Zubik' | agency = Catholic News Service | url = http://ncronline.org/news/politics/court-remands-two-hhs-challenges-lower-courts-light-zubik | work = National Catholic Reporter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21 the Obama administration asked the Courts of Appeals considering the ''Zubik'' cases to allow 65 days for the government to seek advice from third parties on all aspects of the legal dispute, from technical and practical implementation issues to religious and legal insight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2016/07/u-s-seeks-nationwide-advice-on-birth-control-dispute/ |first=Lyle | last=Dennison | title=U.S. seeks nationwide advice on birth-control dispute | accessdate=July 25, 2016| date= July 22, 2016| work= Constitution Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; It published a general appeal for comment and advice from "all interested stakeholders" in the ''Federal Register'' the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Federal Register| url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2016/07/22/2016-17242/coverage-for-contraceptive-services |volume=81| issue=141| date= July 22, 2016| accessdate=July 25, 2016 | title=Coverage for Contraceptive Services| pages=47741–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
