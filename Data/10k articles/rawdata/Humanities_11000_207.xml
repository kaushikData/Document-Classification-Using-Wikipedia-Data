      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4354">'''Adult adoption''' is a form of [[adoption]] between 2 or more adults in order to transfer [[inheritance]] rights and/or [[filiation]].  Adult adoption may be done for various reasons including:  to establish [[intestacy|intestate inheritance rights]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ratliff |first=S. |year=2011 |title=Adult Adoption: Intestate Succession and Class Gifts under the Uniform Probate Code, |journal=Northwestern University Law Review |volume=105 |number=4 |url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/lawreview/v105/n4/1777/LR105n4Ratliff.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; to formalize a [[Stepfamily|step-parent/step-child]] relationship or a [[foster care|foster parent/foster child]] relationship; or to restore the original legal relationship between adult adoptees and their natural families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adoptingback.com/ Healing Families Dismembered By Adoption].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, adult adoption may be used in order to facilitate the continuance of a family business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Financial Economics |volume=108|issue=3|pages=840–854|issn=0304-405X|doi=10.1016/j.jfineco.2013.01.011 |last1=Mehrotra |first1=Vikas  |last2=Morck |first2=Randall  |last3=Shim |first3=Jungwook |last4=Wiwattanakantangd |first4=Yupana  |year=2013 |title=Adoptive Expectations: Rising Sons in Japanese Family Firms |url=http://professor.business.ualberta.ca/randallmorck/~/media/business/FacultyAndStaff/FSA/RandallMorck/Documents/Research/WorkingPapers/AdoptiveexpectationsNBERw168742.pdf  |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This form of adoption is known as ''[[mukoyōshi]]'' (“son-in-law adoption”).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21567419-family-firms-adopt-unusual-approach-remain-competitive-keeping-it-family |work=The Economist |date=December 1, 2012 |title=Keeping it in the family: Family firms adopt an unusual approach to remain competitive |accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Adult adoption may also be used in some jurisdictions by [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]] in order to establish inheritance rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/your-money/estate-planning/21ADOPT.html |last=Jacobs |first=Deborah L. |date=May 20, 2009 |title=Adult Adoption a High-Stakes Means to an Inheritance |work=New York Times |page=Your Money, Estate Planning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the laws of the jurisdiction, adult adoption may not be available as a legal option.  In the United Kingdom, only children may be adopted.  The ''Adoption and Children Act (2002)'' states, "An application for an adoption order may only be made if the person to be adopted has not attained the age of 18 years on the date of the application."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/38/section/49 |title=Adoption and Children Act 2002 |nopp=Y |page=Section 49 (4) |work=[[legislation.gov.uk]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In places where adult adoptions exist, it may or may not transfer [[filiation]] in addition to inheritance rights.  For example, in Colorado, one can adopt an adult of age 21 or older for inheritance purposes, but filiation will remain unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series=Colorado Revised Statutes |chapterurl=http://tornado.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/olls/2014TitlePrintouts/CRS%20Title%2014%20%282014%29.pdf |format=PDF |volume=Title 14 |title=Domestic Matters |page=1  |chapter=Article 1 Adoption - Adults, Section 14-1-101 "Adoption of Adults"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, adoption of a person between the ages of 18 and 20 (inclusive) transfers both inheritance rights and filiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series=Colorado Revised Statutes |volume=Title 19 |title=Children’s Code |chapterurl=http://tornado.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/olls/2014TitlePrintouts/CRS%20Title%2019%20%282014%29.pdf#page=301 |page=301 |chapter=Article 5 Relinquishment and Adoption, Part 2 Adoption, Section 19-5-201 "Who May be Adopted"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{cns|date=December 2016|In most other American states, both filiation and inheritance rights are transferred.}}

The '''American Association of Law Libraries''' "is a [[nonprofit]] educational organization with over 5,000 members nationwide. AALL's mission is to promote and enhance the value of [[law libraries]] to the legal and public communities, to foster the profession of [[law librarian|law librarianship]], and to provide leadership in the field of legal information and information policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/2006/08/eff-aclu-american-association-of-law.html |title=EFF, ACLU, American Association of Law Libraries, Public Citizen, ACLU of Oklahoma, Come to Aid of Deborah Foster, File Amicus Brief in Support |publisher=Recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com |date=2006-08-13 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History and vision==
AALL was founded in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AALL chronology|url=http://www.aallnet.org/top-menu/about/aall-chronology.pdf|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Association of Law Libraries' vision is to be 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"a thriving professional association whose members and libraries-whether physical or virtual legal information services-are recognized as critical to the success of their organizations and as central to society. AALL members possess the knowledge and skills to maintain effectiveness in a constantly changing legal environment. Since the ready availability of legal information is a necessary requirement for a just and [[democratic society]], AALL and its members advocate and work toward fair and equitable access to authentic current and historic legal information, and educate and train library users to be knowledgeable and skilled legal information consumers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Association of Law Libraries|url=http://www.aallnet.org/top-menu/about|accessdate=10 October 2013|authorlink=About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;The first president of the AALL was Arthur James Small (1869-1937), who was elected at the association's formation on July 2, 1906.  Small was a law librarian at the Iowa State Library, and it was his idea to create an organization separate from the American Library Association specifically for law librarianship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houdek|first=F. G.|date=2006|title=AALL history through the eyes of its presidents|url=|journal=Law Library Journal|volume=98|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Small never graduated high school or attended college, yet he successfully served the Iowa State Library for over forty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houdek|first=F. G.|date=2006|title=Frequently asked questions about AALL's first hundred years|url=http://www.aallnet.org/mm/Publications/llj/LLJ-Archives/Vol-98/pub_llj_v98n01/2006-06.pdf|journal=Law Library Journal|volume=98|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick C. Hicks (1875-1956) was another early president who greatly contributed to the AALL's vision.  Hicks was a law librarian at both Yale and Columbia.  In 1919, Hicks was first elected president of the AALL.  He served two terms as president, 1919-1920 and 1920-1921.  In 1923, Hicks authored ''Materials and Methods of Legal Research''.  Prior to the publication of this book, there were very few legal research texts keeping pace with the explosive growth in casebooks and legal literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Etheredge|first=S.|date=2006|title=Frederick C. Hicks: The dean of law librarians|url=|journal=Law Library Journal|volume=98|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hicks was also a major proponent of expanding the scope of the AALL's ''Law Library Journal''.  Prior to Hicks's input, the ''Journal'' mostly served as a depository for AALL committee reports.  Hicks believed an expanded ''Journal'' could cover multiple aspects of law librarianship, ranging from scholarly articles to industry news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=A. H.|date=2006|title=Frederick Hicks's strategic vision for law librarianship|url=http://aallnet.org/mm/Publications/llj/LLJ-Archives/Vol-98/pub_llj_v98n02/2006-19.pdf|journal=Law Library Journal|volume=98|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first woman to be elected AALL president was Rosamond Parma (1884-1946).  She served two terms from 1930 to 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aallnet.org/mm/Member-Resources/AALLawards/award-hof/Hall-of-Fame-Members/Parma.html|title=Rosamond Parma, 1884-1946|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parma was also the first law librarian for the University of California, serving as director of UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall library from 1911 to 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cla-net.org/page/988/California-Library-Hall-of-Fame-Rosamond-Parma.htm|title=California Library Hall of Fame: Rosamond Parma|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also managed the ''California Law Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|orig-year=1947|title=Rosamond Parma, 1884-1946|journal=California Law Review|volume=35|issue=1|page=91|jstor=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry Bitner (1916-2001), who served as president for 1963-1964, helped elevate the position of law librarian from an under-educated service position to today's highly skilled specialists.  Bitner outlined his thoughts in a ''Law Library Journal'' essay titled "The Educational Background of the University's Law Librarian" where he advocated college, library school, and law school degrees for new law librarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vinson|first=J.|date=2010|title=Fostering the profession of law: The lifetime achievements of Harry Bitner|url=|journal=Legal Reference Services Quarterly|volume=29|issue=2|doi=10.1080/02703191003751222|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1953, Bitner, along with Miles O. Price, authored ''Effective Legal Research''.  This work updated and advanced many of the themes first presented in Hick's ''Materials and Methods of Legal Research''.  As president, Bitner was instrumental in establishing a permanent headquarters for the AALL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=M. L.|date=2002|title=Harry Bitner: A memorial|url=http://aallnet.org/mm/Publications/llj/LLJ-Archives/Vol-94/pub_llj_v94n02/2002-14.pdf|journal=Law Library Journal|volume=94|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==
The AALL and its members have a long history of proactively influencing policy initiatives in the legal information field.  The 1970s were the beginning of the modern era of AALL advocacy.  This decade saw the association helping to provide input and shape several important policy issues such as the 1975 Federal Trade Commission's ''Guides for the Law Book Industry'', the ''[[Copyright Act of 1976]]'', and the 1972 and 1978 amendments to [[Title 44 of the United States Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baish|first=M. A.|year=2003|title=AALL's advocacy program gets better all the time. . . with a lot of help from its members|journal=AALL Spectrum|volume=7|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, AALL's Government Relations Office staff, along with local chapters and AALL members, held the first Local Advocate Lobby Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aallnet.org/Documents/Government-Relations/LobbyDay2013.pdf|title=Lobby Day 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This event consists of visits to House and Senate offices to raise the profile of information policy issues pertinent to the AALL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltren|first=E.|date=2015|title=AALL Lobby Day Paves the Way for Successful Advocacy Relationships|journal=AALL Spectrum|volume=19|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AALL took a strong position against the [[Federal Register Modernization Act (H.R. 4195; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would require the ''[[Federal Register]]'' to be published (e.g., by electronic means), rather than printed, and that documents in the ''Federal Register'' be made available for sale or distribution to the public in published form.&lt;ref name="4195sum"&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4195 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4195|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; AALL argued that the bill "undermines" citizens' "right to be informed" by making it more difficult for "citizens to find their government's regulations."&lt;ref name="AALLoppose"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations|url=http://aallnet.org/Documents/Government-Relations/Issue-Briefs-and-Reports/2014/FRonepager.pdf|publisher=American Association of Law Libraries|accessdate=14 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715020300/http://aallnet.org/Documents/Government-Relations/Issue-Briefs-and-Reports/2014/FRonepager.pdf|archive-date=2014-07-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to AALL, a survey they conducted "revealed that members of the public, librarians, researchers, students, attorneys, and small business owners continue to rely on the print" version of the ''Federal Register''.&lt;ref name="AALLoppose" /&gt; AALL also argued that the lack of print versions of the ''Federal Register'' and ''CFR'' would mean the 15 percent of Americans who don't use the internet would lose their access to that material.&lt;ref name="AALLoppose" /&gt;

==Publication==
The primary publication produced by AALL is the quarterly '''''[[Law Library Journal]]'''''.  In 1907, Frederick W. Schenk made the recommendation for both a quarterly journal and index.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008|title=A Law Library Journal centennial timeline: Highlights from one hundred years of LLJ history|url=http://www.aallnet.org/mm/Publications/llj/LLJ-Archives/Vol-100/pub_llj_v100n03/2008-24.pdf|journal=Law Library Journal|volume=100|issue=3|pages=541-554}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Law Library Journal'' has been the official publication of AALL since 1908 and contains scholarly articles on law, legal materials, legal research, and librarianship. The AALL also produces a monthly magazine, The ''AALL Spectrum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aallnet.org/main-menu/Publications/llj |title=American Association of Law Libraries Law Library Journal |publisher=Aallnet.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the AALL was the first publisher of the ''Index to Legal Periodicals'', including it with the ''[[Law Library Journal]]'' beginning in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aallnet.org/tm/about/aall-chronology.pdf |title=AALL Chronology |publisher=AALL |date= |accessdate=2014-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Printing of the ''Index to Legal Periodicals'' was passed to the [[H. W. Wilson Company|H.W. Wilson Company]] in April 1912, and the company assumed business management duties of the ''Index'' in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aallnet.org/tm/about/aall-chronology.pdf |title=AALL Chronology |publisher=AALL |date= |accessdate=2014-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The AALL publishes a monthly eNewsletter, as well as periodic eBriefings.  Many current AALL publications, such as ''AALL Biennial Salary Survey'', ''AALL Price Index for Legal Publications'', and ''Guide to Fair Business Practices'' are focused on law librarianship advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aallnet.org/mm/publications|title=Publications|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AALL also produces the ''[[Index to Foreign Legal Periodicals]]'', an index providing multilingual coverage of foreign, international, and comparative legal journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aallnet.org/mm/Publications/products/Index-to-Foreign-Legal-Periodicals.html |title=Index to Foreign Legal Periodicals |publisher=AALL |date= |accessdate=2014-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4608">The '''antiquarian book trade in the United States''' is an aspect of [[book collecting]] and [[publishing]]. The term ''[[antiquarian]]'', in general, refers to [[antiquities]] and collectible items usually considered old and rare, usually in reference to books, but is not limited to books. The word antiquarian could also be used to describe a person who collects rare books or other antique items. 

Two key figures who have written a great deal on the U.S. antiquarian book trade specifically are [[Leona Rostenberg]] (1908&amp;ndash;2005) and [[Madeleine B. Stern]] (1912&amp;ndash;2007), both of whom were also in the business of collecting and selling [[rare books]]. Other histories having covered the topic include [[Isaiah Thomas (publisher)|Isaiah Thomas]], writing in 1810 his ''History of printing in America''; Henry Walcott Boynton’s ''Annals of American Bookselling, 1638-1850'', first published in 1932; Hellmut Lehmann-Haupt’s ''The Book in America: A History of the Making, the Selling, and the Collecting of Books in the United States'' (1939).

The antiquarian book trade has roots in Colonial America, and may be considered in the study of American history and literature, print culture, and book history. Antiquarian book fairs have long been an important aspect of the trade. Today, the [[Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America]] (ABAA) is the primary organization of the trade in the United States. Other organizations include the [[Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing]] (SHARP). The [[Rare Book School]] at the University of Virginia is the premier institution for those seeking an advanced education in the field.

==History==

The beginnings of the antiquarian book trade can be traced to British North America, specifically Boston of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].&lt;ref&gt;Stern, M. B. (1985). Antiquarian bookselling in the United States: A History from the origins to the 1940s. Westport, CT: Greenwood. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; There is no established date of when this business of book collecting actually begins, however Stern attributes the beginnings to [[John Dunton]]’s visit to Boston in 1686, in which he brought along numerous books from his native England. Printed materials and books however were already available in Boston, the first book shop having been opened in 1647 by [[Hezekiah Usher]].&lt;ref&gt;  tern, M. B. (1985). Antiquarian bookselling in the United States: A History from the origins to the 1940s. Westport, CT: Greenwood. p. 3p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The act of collecting and selling books as a form of business increases later in seventeenth century, with 1693 being the date of the earliest printed catalogue of books in the American colonies.     

Events in Boston during the eighteenth century proved both difficult and advantageous for the antiquarian book trade. For example, a fire broke out in 1711 that consumed nearly every bookshop then in existence in Boston. In the next two decades antiquarian booksellers rebuilt and gradually began to thrive, with the presence of [[Harvard College]], as well as a certain literary and educational milieu in Boston allowing the development of the antiquarian book trade.

In the later eighteenth century, the heart of the antiquarian trade shifted to Philadelphia and New York City, growing with an increasingly educated public and independence from Britain. With the movement of people westward bookselling spread, and soon, small cities like Cincinnati become known in the book trade.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, W. (1961). The Western book trade: Cincinnati as a nineteenth century publishing and book-trade center. Columbus, OH: Ohio State University. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The trade spread to Richmond and New Orleans, then to Texas,  St. Louis, Chicago, and eventually, following the gold rush, to California.

{{History of Assyrian people}}'''Assyrian continuity''' is the claim by modern Assyrians and supporting academics that they are ''at root'' the direct descendants of the [[Semitic people|Semitic]] inhabitants who spoke originally [[Akkadians|Akkadian]] and later [[Imperial Aramaic]] of ancient [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]] and their immediate surrounds.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-11669994&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Assyrians are accepted to be an [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[ethnic minority]] of modern [[Iraq]], southeast [[Turkey]], northeastern [[Syria]] and border areas of northwest [[Iran]], a region that is roughly what was once ancient [[Assyria]].

They are a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]-speaking people who still speak, read and write [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-influenced [[Eastern Aramaic]] dialects. They are [[Christians]], with most being members of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]], [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]] and [[Ancient Church of the East]]

There has been a contingent of contemporary Western scholars supporting Assyrian continuity, including [[Simo Parpola]],&lt;ref name="Assyrians After Assyria, Parpola"/&gt; [[Richard N. Frye]],&lt;ref name="Frye, R. N. 1992"&gt;Frye, R. N. (October 1992). "Assyria and Syria: Synonyms" (PDF). ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies''. 51 (4): 281–285. doi:10.1086/373570.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frye, R. N. 1992"/&gt; [[Mordechai Nisan]], [[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]], [[H.W.F Saggs]] and [[Robert D. Biggs]].&lt;ref&gt;''Especially in view of the very early establishment of Christianity in Assyria and its continuity to the present and the continuity of the population, I think there is every likelihood that ancient Assyrians are among the ancestors of modern Assyrians'' Biggs p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of Assyrian continuity point to the continued existence of Assyria as a name for a [[geopolitical]] entity long after its empire fell and that Assyrian religion and Akkadian-Mesopotamian names persisted until the Christian period. There is a complete [[absence of evidence]] that the population of Assyria was wiped out of existence after its fall, the continual documented use of the term "Assyrian" and its derivatives, and that the Indo-European words ''Syria'', ''Syriac'' and ''Syrian'' derive from Assyria and Assyrian and for many centuries referred to only Assyrian.

==Arguments for continuity from the Classical Era: Assyria vs Syria==
A major argument used by the promoters of Assyrian continuity is that "Syrian" and ''Syriac'', the names used in many languages to refer to  Syriac Christians, are ultimately derived from "Assyrian". The terms ''Syrian'' and ''Syriac'' were also in past times used by deniers of continuity as a major reason for their position.

However, the 21st century discovery of the [[Çineköy inscription|Çineköy Inscription]] appears to conclusively prove the already largely prevailing position that the term "Syria" derives from the Assyrian term 𒀸𒋗𒁺 𐎹 '''''Aššūrāyu'''''. The Çineköy inscription is a [[Hieroglyphic Luwian]]-[[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] [[bilingual inscription|bilingual]], uncovered from Çineköy, [[Adana Province]], Turkey (ancient [[Cilicia]]), dating to the 8th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Tekoglu, R. &amp; Lemaire, A. (2000). La bilingue royale louvito-phénicienne de Çineköy. ''Comptes rendus de l'Académie des inscriptions, et belleslettres, année 2000'', 960–1006.&lt;/ref&gt; This Indo-European corruption of Assyrian was later adopted by the Seleucid Greeks from the late 4th century BC or early 3rd century BC and also then applied (or misapplied) to non-Assyrian peoples from the [[Levant]], causing not only the true [[Assyria]]ns (Syrians), but also the largely [[Aramean]], [[History of ancient Lebanon|Phoenician]] and [[Nabatean]] peoples of the Levant to be collectively called ''Syrians'' or ''Syriacs'' in the Greco-Roman world.

In [[Classical Greece|Classical]] Greek usage, ''Syria'' and ''Assyria'' were used almost interchangeably. Herodotus's distinctions between the two in the 5th century BC were a notable early exception,&lt;ref name=Dalley&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UhVfijsPxOMC&amp;pg=PA94 The legacy of Mesopotamia], [[Stephanie Dalley]], p94&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peyton R. Helm|Randolph Helm]] emphasizes that Herodotus "never" applied the term Syria to Mesopotamia, which he always called "Assyria", and used "Syria" to refer to inhabitants of the coastal Levant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=79wj2hj4wKUC&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= The Modern Assyrians of the Middle East: A History of Their Encounter with Western Christian Missions, Archaeologists, and Colonial Powers|author= John Joseph|page= 21|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; While himself maintaining a distinction, Herodotus also claimed that "those called ''Syrians'' by the Hellenes (Greeks) are called ''Assyrians'' by the barbarians (non-Greeks).&lt;ref name="Herodotus VII.63"&gt;(Pipes 1992), [[s:History of Herodotus/Book 7]]&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |authorlink= |author=[[Herodotus]] |coauthors= |title=Herodotus VII.63 |url=http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/greek-babylon.html |work= |publisher= |id= |date= |accessdate= |quote=VII.63: The Assyrians went to war with helmets upon their heads made of brass, and plaited in a strange fashion which is not easy to describe.

'The Greek historian [[Thucydides]] reports that during the Peloponnesian wars (c. 410 BC) the Athenians intercepted a Persian who was carrying a message from the Great King to Sparta. The man was taken prisoner, brought to Athens, and the letters he was carrying were translated "from the Assyrian language", which of course was Aramaic.

The first century prior to the dawn of Christianity, the geographer [[Strabo]] (64 BC–21 AD)  writes that whom historians (most likely Greek ones) call Syrian were actually Assyrian;

''When those who have written histories about the Syrian empire say that the Medes were overthrown by the Persians and the Syrians by the Medes, they mean by the Syrians no other people than those who built the royal palaces in Ninus ([[Nineveh]]); and of these Syrians, Ninus was the man who founded Ninus, in ''Aturia'' ([[Assyria]]) and his wife, [[Semiramis]], was the woman who succeeded her husband... Now, the city of Ninus was wiped out immediately after the overthrow of the Syrians. It was much greater than Babylon, and was situated in the plain of Aturia.'' Although the mention of Ninus as having founded Assyria is inaccurate, as is the claim that Semiramis was his wife, the salient point in Strabo's statement is the recognition that the Greek term Syria historically meant Assyria. It was the Assyrian Empire, not the "Syrian Empire", that was overthrown by the Medes and built palaces in Ninevah.&lt;ref&gt;P. 195 (16. I. 2-3) of Strabo, translated by Horace Jones (1917), The Geography of Strabo London : W. Heinemann ; New York : G.P. Putnam's Sons&lt;/ref&gt; However, while this statement provides insight into how "Syrian" was used ''by the Greeks'' (supporting the "lost a" theory), claims that Syria and Assyria were considered synonymous ''to non-Greeks'', including Syrians themselves, as alleged by Herodotus, are cast in doubt considering his remark in  ''Geographika'': "[[Poseidonius]] (a celebrated polymath and native of [[Apamea, Syria]]) conjectures that the names of these nations also are akin; for, says he, ''the people whom we call Syrians are by the Syrians themselves called Arameans... for the people in Syria are Aramaeans''".

"Syria" and "Assyria" were not fully distinguished by Greeks until they became better acquainted with the Near East. Under Macedonian rule after Syria's conquest by [[Alexander the Great]], "Syria" was restricted to the land west of the Euphrates. While the Romans mostly corrected their usage as well&lt;ref name=jj&gt;Joseph, ''Assyria and Syria: Synonyms?'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; they continued to conflate the term in some cases.

[[Flavius Josephus]], Roman Jewish historian writing in the 1st century AD describes the inhabitants of the state of [[Osroene]] as Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ta08AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World|first1=Patricia|last1=Crone|first2=Professor of Islamic History at the Institute for Advanced Study Patricia|last2=Crone|first3=Michael|last3=Cook|first4=Michael J.|last4=Cook|date=21 April 1977|publisher=CUP Archive|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Osroene]] was a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] speaking state based around [[Edessa]] in Upper Mesopotamia,&lt;ref&gt;The Ancient Name of Edessa," Amir Harrak, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 51, No. 3 (July 1992): 209-214 [3]&lt;/ref&gt; a key center of early Syriac Christianity. He also points out the Greek misapplication of the term ''Syrian''; In referring to [[Aramea]] in the ''Antiquities of the Jews'', Josephus states that "Aram had the Arameans, which the Greeks called Syrians."&lt;ref&gt;''Antiquities of the Jews'', translated by William Whiston&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Justin (historian)|Justinus]], the Roman historian wrote in 300 AD: ''The ''Assyrians'', who are afterwards called ''Syrians'', held their empire thirteen hundred years''.&lt;ref&gt;The Origins of Syrian Nationhood: Histories, Pioneers and Identity Adel Beshara&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 380s AD, the Roman historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] during his travels in [[Upper Mesopotamia]] with [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]] states that; "Within this circuit is [[Adiabene]], which was formerly called [[Assyria]];"   Ammianus Marcellinus also refers to an extant region still called [[Assyria]] located between the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]].&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus. XXIII.6.20 and XXXIII.3.1, from http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ammianus_23_book23.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael the Syrian]] mentions a 9th-century AD dispute between Jacobite Syrians with Greek scholars, in which the Jacobites claimed Assyrian continuity.
''That even if their name is now "Syrian", they are originally "Assyrians" and they have had many honourable kings... Syria is in the west of Euphrates, and its inhabitants who are talking our Aramaic language, and who are so-called "Syrians", are only a part of the "all" (the all meaning Aramaic speaking Christians), while the other part which was in the east of Euphrates, going to Persia, had many kings from Assyria and Babylon and Urhay... Assyrians, who were called "Syrians" by the Greeks, were also the same Assyrians, I mean "Assyrians" from "Assur" (Ashur) who built the city of Nineveh''&lt;ref&gt;History of Mikhael The Great Chabot Edition p. 748, 750, quoted after Addai Scher, Hestorie De La Chaldee Et De "Assyrie"&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the later non-indigenous [[Indo-European languages]], what is today the modern [[Syrian Arab Republic]] was always distinct from [[Assyria]], and the [[Levant]] never held the name Syria/Assyria for over two thousand years of written history, only having the name bestowed upon it during the early part of the [[Seleucid Empire]] (312–150 BC).

During the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2335–2154 BC), [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]] (2119–2004 BC) and [[Old Assyrian Empire]] (1975–1750 BC) and [[Babylonian Empire]] the region which is now Syria was called ''The Land of the Amurru'' and later ''[[Mitanni]]'', referring to the [[Amorites]] and the [[Hurrians]] who were the most prominent populations. During the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365-1020 BC), and continuing throughout the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (935-605 BC) and the succeeding [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (605–539 BC) and [[Achaemenid Empire]], (539–323 BC) Syria was known as [[Aramea]] and later [[Eber Nari]].

==Arguments for continuity during the medieval period and Renaissance==
The 10th-century AD Arab scholar [[Ibn al-Nadim]], while describing the books and scripture of many people defines the word "''[[Ashuriyun]]''" ([[Arabic]] for [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]) as "a sect of Jesus" inhabiting northern Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Fihrist (Catalog): A Tenth Century Survey of Islamic Culture''. Abu 'l Faraj Muhammad ibn Ishaq al Nadim. ''Great Books of the Islamic World''. Kazi Publications. Translator: Bayard Dodge.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-16th century AD, [[Pope Julius III]] initially named the church of converts from the Assyrian Church to Catholicism as ''The [[Church of Athura]] (Assyria) and Mosul'', and its first Patriarch [[Yohannan Sulaqa]] as ''Patriarch of the Eastern Assyrians''. This was later changed to ''The [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]''.

During the 16th century AD, according to the "Chronicle of the Carmelites in Persia", [[Pope Paul V]], in a letter to the Persian Shah Abbas I (1571–1629) of 3 November 1612 mentions that the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobites]] endorsed an "Assyrian" identity.&lt;ref&gt;H. Chick: ''A Chronicle of the Carmelites in Persia.'' London 1939, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sharaf Khan Al-Bedlissi]], a 16th-century AD [[Kurds|Kurdish]] historian mentions ''Asuri'' (Assyrians) as being extant in northern Mesopotamia&lt;ref&gt;Sharafnameh", translated by Jamil Rozbeyati, Al-Najah Publishing house, Baghdad – 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poutrus Nasri]], an Egyptian theologian, claims that The Church of the East had many adherents who espoused an Assyrian identity during the Parthian and Sassanid periods.&lt;ref&gt;see Poutrus Nasri (1974). ''History of Syriac Literature''. Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early modern opinions favoring continuity==
Proponents of continuity such as [[Stephanie Dalley]] point out that as late as the 18th and 19th centuries, the region around [[Mosul]] was known as [[Athura]] by the native Christian population, which means "Assyria".&lt;ref&gt;Dalley, Stephanie (1993). ''Nineveh After 612 BC''. Alt-Orientanlische Forshchungen 20. p.134.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Christian missionary Horatio Southgate, "Syrian" and "Assyrian" were self-identifications among Jacobites (Syriac Orthodox) he met in 1841, before the Ancient Assyrian sites were rediscovered by archaeologists in 1894:
"I began to make inquiries for the Syrians. The people informed me that there were about one hundred families of them in the town of Kharpout, and a village inhabited by them on the plain. I observed that the [[Armenians]] did not know them under the name which I used, ''Syriani''; but called them ''Assouri'', which struck me the more at the moment from its resemblance to our English name ''Assyrians'', from whom they claim their origin, being sons, as they say, of Ashur who "out of the land of Shinar went forth, and build Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resin between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city." &lt;ref&gt;[Horatio Southgate, Narrative of a Visit to the Syrian [Jacobite] Church of Mesopotamia (1844)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Englist priest [[Henry Burgess (clergyman)|Henry Burgess]], writing in the early 1850s, states that [[Upper Mesopotamia]] was known as [[Assyria]]/[[Athura]] by the Semitic Christian population of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Henry. ''The Repentance of Nineveh''. Sampson Low: Son and Co., London, (1853) p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of 19th-century Assyriologists such as [[Austen Henry Layard]], the Assyrian archaeologist [[Hormuzd Rassam]] and the Anglican missionary and Orientalist [[George Percy Badger]] supported Assyrian continuity.

[[E.B. Soane]] wrote in 1892, "The [[Mosul]] people, especially the Christians are very proud of their city and the antiquity of its surroundings; the Christians, regard themselves as direct descendants of the great rulers of Assyria".&lt;ref&gt;Soane, E.B. ''To Mesopotamia and Kurdistan in Disguise''. John Murray: London, 1912. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sidney Smith (historian)|Sidney Smith]] argued in 1926 that poor communities continued to perpetuate some basic Assyrian identity after the fall of the empire through to the present.{{#tag:ref|"In Achaemenian times there was an Assyrian detachment in the Persian army, but they could only have been a remnant. That remnant persisted through the centuries to the Christian era and beyond, and continued to use in their personal names appellations of their pagan deities. This continuance of an Assyrian tradition is significant for two reasons; the miserable conditions of these late Assyrians is attested to by the excavations at Ashur, and it is clear that they were reduced to extreme poverty by the time of Parthian rule."&lt;ref&gt;S. Smith, "Notes on the Assyrian Tree". ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'' (1926): 69.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} [[Efram Yildiz]] echoes this view also.

Anglican missionary, Rev. [[W. A. Wigram]], in his book ''The Assyrians and Their Neighbours'' (1929), writes, "The Assyrian stock, still resident in the provinces about the ruins of [[Nineveh]], [[Mosul]], [[Erbil|Arbela]], and [[Kirkuk]], and seem to have been left to their own customs in the same way."&lt;ref&gt;Rev. W.A. Wigram (1929). ''The Assyrians and Their Neighbours''. London.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[R. S. Stafford]] in 1935 describes the Assyrians as descending from the Ancient Assyrians, surviving the various periods of foreign rule intact, and until [[World War I]] of having worn items of clothing much like the ancient Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tragedy of the Assyrians''. Lt. Col. R.S. Stafford  D.S.O., M.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern views===
Some Academics including [[John Joseph (historian)|John Joseph]], largely reject the modern Assyrian claim of descent from the ancient Assyrians of Mesopotamia, and their succeeding  the  Sumero-Akkadians and the Babylonians  as one continuous civilization.'&lt;ref name=refugees&gt;[http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/docserver/9789004323285_webready_content_s010.pdf ''Refugee Camps and the Spatialization of Assyrian Nationalism in Iraq''] The rising European missionary presence in the Hakkari region coincided with a number of archeological excavations of the ancient ruins of Nineveh and Babylon, and especially with the discovery of the Nimrud palace of Ashur-nasirpalii in 1848. Missionaries drew on these recent discoveries of pre-Islamic Assyrian greatness to promote the idea of this branch of eastern Christians as direct descendants of this ancient empire. It was during the late nineteenth century that western missionaries also began to popularize the word Assyrian previously the most prominent of a number of mostly religious designations, as a mode of identifying the present-day community with the ancient empires. Originally, this idea may have been suggested by local assistants to the excavations like the Assyrian activist Hormuzd Rassam; certainly it buttressed community ambitions for local autonomy, as well as romantic missionary imaginings of an untouched "original" Christian community.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; 
''[[The Political Dictionary of the Modern Middle East]]'' claims exactly this continuity, describing the modern Assyrians as "Remnants of the people of ancient Mesopotamia, succeeding the Sumero-Akkadians and the Babylonians as one continuous civilization." Korbani, Agnes G. (1995). ''The Political Dictionary of the Modern Middle East'', Lanham, Md.: University Press of America.&lt;/ref&gt;  He criticizes modern Assyrian writers who "eager to establish a link between themselves and the ancient Assyrians, conclude that such a link is confirmed whenever they come across a reference to the word Assyrians during the early Christian period, to them it proves that their Christian ancestors always 'remembered' their Assyrian forefathers. Nationalist writers often refer to [[Tatian]]'s statement that he was 'born in the land of the Assyrians', and note that the Acts of Mar Qardagh trace the martyr's ancestry to Ancient Assyrian kings".&lt;ref&gt;The ancestry of the semi-legendary Mar Qardagh is dubious. (Miller/Joseph)&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that while "The name Assyrian was certainly used prior to the nineteenth century", it "was a well known name throughout the centuries and wherever the Bible was held holy, whether in the East or West," thanks to the Old Testament.&lt;ref name=response&gt;"We are Assyrians" A Response by John Joseph, commentary on the eponymous article in the Journal of Assyrian academic Studies (JAAS) (Vol. XVI, No.1, pp. 177-95), Written in Syriac by Odisho Malko Gewargis of Baghdad, Iraq, translated to English by Youel A. Baaba.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam H. Becker]] of [[New York University]] disagrees with an Assyrian continuity and writes that the special continuity claims "must be understood as a modern invention worthy of the study of a [[Benedict Anderson]] or an [[Eric Hobsbawm]] rather than an ancient historian." (both study the origins of invented traditions in nationalism) Becker describes Assyrians as a people he calls ''East Syrians'' in his writings.&lt;ref name="GardnerOsterloh2008"&gt;Adam H. Becker. "The Ancient Near East in the Late Antique Near East: Syriac Christian Appropriation of the Biblical East" in Gregg Gardner, Kevin Lee Osterloh (eds.) ''Antiquity in Antiquity: Jewish and Christian pasts in the Greco-Roman world'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=oD2vKMCu_JgC&amp;pg=PA396 p. 396], 2008, Mohr Siebeck, {{ISBN|978-3-16-149411-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Wilmshurst]], a historian of the Church of the East, believes that Assyrian identity only emerged as a consequence of the earlier archaeological discovery of the ruins of Nineveh in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilmshurst|2011|pp=413–416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any continuity, he argues, is insignificant, if it exists at all.

However, these arguments appear to be contradicted by the observations made by [[Horatio Southgate]]&lt;ref&gt;"I began to make inquiries for the Syrians. The people informed me that there were about one hundred families of them in the town of Kharpout, and a village inhabited by them on the plain. I observed that the Armenians did not know them under the name which I used, Syriani; but called them Assouri, which struck me the more at the moment from its resemblance to our English name Assyrians, from whom they claim their origin, being sons, as they say, of Assour who 'out of the land of Shinar went forth, and build Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resin between Nineveh and Calah." Horatio Southgate, "Narrative of a Visit to the Syrian Church", 1844 p.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst travelling in northern Mesopotamia in the early 1840s in the period "prior" to these Assyrian archaeological discoveries show that the Armenians of southeastern Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia were at that period clearly using the term 'Assyrian' in preference to the term 'Syrian', and that the Assyrians in these regions clearly regarded themselves as Assyrians descendant from their ancient namesakes.

Another argument is based on the etymology of "Syria". The noted [[Iranologist]] [[Richard Nelson Frye]] supports ethnic continuity from ancient times to the present, arguing successfully that the term 'Syrian' originating from 'Assyrian' supports continuity, particularly when applied to the Semites in northern Mesopotamia and its surrounds. In a response to John Joseph, Frye writes "I do not understand why Joseph and others ignore the evidence of Armenian, Arab and Persian sources in regard to usage with initial a-, including contemporary practice."&lt;ref&gt;Frye, ''Reply to John Joseph'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Rollinger]] also uses this line of argumentation to support continuity.&lt;ref name="Rollinger"&gt;Rollinger, Robert (2006). "The terms 'Assyria' and 'Syria' again". "Assyriology". ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', '''65'''(4). pp. 284–287.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph was long skeptical about the initial a-theory, but has since been forced to accept it following the discovery of the [[Cinekoy Inscription]] which proved his assertions wrong. 

Prominent [[Assyriologist]] [[H. W. F. Saggs]] in his ''[[The Might That Was Assyria]]'' points out that the Assyrian population was never wiped out, bred out or deported after the fall of its empire, and that after Christianisation the Assyrians have continued to keep alive their identity and heritage.{{#tag:ref|"The destruction of the Assyrian Empire did not wipe out its population. They were predominantly peasant farmers, and since Assyria contains some of the best wheat land in the Near East, descendants of the Assyrian peasants would, as opportunity permitted, build new villages over the old cities and carried on with agricultural life, remembering traditions of the former cities. After seven or eight centuries and after various vicissitudes, these people became Christians. These Christians, and the Jewish communities scattered amongst them, not only kept alive the memory of their Assyrian predecessors but also combined them with traditions from the Bible."&lt;ref name="Saggs, p. 290"&gt;Saggs, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} However, Saggs disputes an extreme ''racial purity'', he points out that even at its mightiest, Assyria deported populations of [[Jews]], [[Elamites]], [[Arameans]], [[Neo-Hittites]], [[Urartians]] and others into Assyria, and that these peoples became ''Assyrianised'' and were absorbed and blended into the native population.

Assyriologist [[J. A. Brinkman]] argues that there is absolutely no historical evidence or proof to suggest the population of Assyria was wiped out, bred out of existence or removed at any time following the destruction of its empire. He puts the burden of proof upon those arguing against continuity to prove their case with strong evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Jump up  ^ From a lecture by J. A. Brinkman: "There is no reason to believe that there would be no racial or cultural continuity in Assyria, since there is no evidence that the population of Assyria was removed."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Efram Yildiz's "The Assyrians" Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, 13.1, pp. 22, ref 24 (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; Brinkman goes on to mention that the gods of the Assyrian Pantheon were certainly still being worshiped even 900 years after the fall of the Assyrian Empire. He also indicated that Assur and Calah, among other cities, were prosperous and still occupied by Assyrians, which he claims indicates a continuity of Assyrian identity and culture well into the Syriac Christian period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nestorian.org/who_are_the_assyrians ]{{dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Curtis (historian)|John Curtis]] strongly disputes assumptions based on biblical interpretations that Assyria became an uninhabited wasteland after its fall, pointing out its wealth and influence during the various periods of Persian rule.&lt;ref name="Curtis 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Curtis |first=John |date=November 2003 | location =Paris, France |title=The Achaemenid Period in Northern Iraq |journal=L'archéologie de l'empire achéménide |url=http://www.aina.org/articles/curtis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that [[Achaemenid Assyria]] flourished; and Assyrians soldiers were a remnant of Achaemenid armies, holding important civic positions, with their agriculture providing a breadbasket for the empire. Imperial Aramaic and Assyrian administrative practices were also retained by the Achaemenid kings In addition, it is known that a number of important Assyrian cities such as [[Arbil|Arbela]], [[Guzana]] and [[Harran]] survived intact, and others, such as [[Assur]] and [[Arrapha]] recovered from their previous destruction. For those cities that remained devastated, such as [[Nineveh]] and [[Calah]], smaller towns were built nearby, such as Mepsila.&lt;ref&gt;Printed in ''Nabu Magazine'', Vol. 3, Issue 1 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Roux]] notes that Assyrian culture and national religion were alive into the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, with the city of [[Assur]] possibly being independent for a while in the 3rd century AD, and that the Neo-Assyrian kingdom of [[Adiabene]] was a virtual resurrection of Assyria, but emphasizes that "the revived settlements [in ancient Assyria] had very little in common architecturally  with their earlier precursors".&lt;ref name="Roux"&gt;George Roux. '' Iraq''.&lt;/ref&gt; Roux also states however that, "After the fall of Assyria, however, its actual name was gradually changed to 'Syria'; thus, in the Babylonian version of Darius I inscriptions, Eber-nari ("across-the-river," i.e. Syria, Palestine and Phoenicia) corresponds to the Persian and Elamite Athura (Assyria); besides, in the Behistun inscription, Izalla, the region of Syria renowned for its wine, is assigned to Athura."

Roux, as well as Saggs, note that a time came when Akkadian inscriptions were meaningless to the inhabitants of Assyria, and ceased to be spoken by the common people.&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Iraq'' (1992 edition), pp.411–412, 419–420, 423–424&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.W.F. Saggs, ''The Might that Was Assyria'', pp. 125 seq.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, ''A Study of History'' (1954), viii, pp. 440–442&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Assyrianism take this same line of argumentation in explaining that, even though the Assyrians were not wiped out ethnically, their original  culture changed.

[[W. W. Tarn]] states also that Assyrians and their culture were still extant well into the Christian period.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Ancient History: The Roman Republic, 133–44 B.C.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Tarn; Cambridge University Press; 1985; pp 597.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patricia Crone]] and [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]] note that Assyrian consciousness did not die out after the fall of its empire, asserting that a major revival of Assyrian consciousness and culture took place between the 2nd century BC and 4th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crone|Cook|1977|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some continuity-supporters, though not all, argue that Assyrian culture is continuous from ancient times until today. The Assyriologist [[Simo Parpola]]  echoes Saggs, Brinkman and Biggs, says that there is strong evidence that Assyrian identity and culture continued after the fall of the Assyrian Empire.&lt;ref name="Assyrians After Assyria, Parpola"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians+after+Assyria.html|title=ERROR 404 - PAGE NOT FOUND|website=www.nineveh.com|access-date=2018-06-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524085323/http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html|archive-date=2018-05-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parpola asserts that traditional Assyrian religion remained strong until the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, surviving among small communities of Assyrians up to at least the 10th century AD in Upper Mesopotamia, and as late as the 18th century AD in [[Mardin]].&lt;ref name="nineveh.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nineveh.com/parpola_eng.pdf |title=Assyrian Identity In Ancient Times And Today' |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parpola asserts that the [[Neo-Assyrian]] [[Upper Mesopotamia]]n kingdoms of [[Adiabene]], [[Assur]], [[Osrhoene]], [[Beth Nuhadra]], [[Beth Garmai]] and to some degree [[Hatra]] which existed between the 1st century BC and 5th century AD in Assyria, were distinctly Assyrian linguistically, as they wrote in the [[Syriac language]], a dialect of Aramaic which began in geographic Assyria.

Similarly, [[J.B Segal]] argues that  "Although the Assyrian empire had fallen, the Assyrians continued to retain the Assyrian culture" in [[Edessa]], [[Urhay]] and [[Upper Mesopotamia]], with gods such as Sin, Shamash, Ashur, Hadad and Ishtar of Nineveh being worshipped until Eastern Rite Christianity took hold. He also states that  "Within the Abgar dynasty, there were kings named Mannu, the Akkadian name that was found in the Assyrian inscriptions from the assyrian city of Tushan" (southeastern Turkey).{{#tag:ref|"Although the Assyrian empire had fell, the Assyrians retained the Assyrian culture alive. In his book "Edessa: The Blessed City" JB Segal confirms just that. Before Abgar Dynasty in Urhoy received Christianity, Urhoy was a city of Assyrian gods Nabu, Sin, Shamash, Ashur, Bel and Ishtar of Nineveh. Within the Abgar dynasty, there were kings named Mannu, the Akkadian name that was found in the Assyrian inscriptions from the assyrian city of Tushan(southeastern Turkey). This demonstrates that the people of Urhoy and in northern Mesopotamia retained its Assyrian identity and culture long after the Assyrian empire ceased to exist."&lt;ref&gt;''Edessa: The Blessed City''. JB Segal&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

[[Robert D. Biggs]] supports genealogical/ethnic continuity without prejudicing cultural continuity, asserting that the modern Assyrians are the ''ethnic'' descendants of their ancient ancestors but became ''culturally'' different from them with the advent of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Biggs p 10&lt;/ref&gt; "Especially in view of the very early establishment of Christianity in Assyria and its continuity to the present and the continuity of the population, I think there is every likelihood that ancient Assyrians are among the ancestors of modern Assyrians."

British historian [[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]] in an article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' of 2017 clearly links the modern Assyrians to the ancient Assyrians, stating that they are the Christianized ancestors of the ancient Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/11452080/Islamic-States-thugs-are-trying-to-wipe-an-entire-civilisation-from-the-face-of-the-earth.html|title=Islamic State's thugs are trying to wipe an entire civilisation from the face of the earth|first=Tom|last=Holland|date=5 March 2015|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences between Assyrians and neighboring peoples===

[[Silvio Zaorani]] differentiates between Levantine [[Aramean]] and Mesopotamian [[Assyria]]n populations, stating that; "even if "Syrian" were derived from "Assyrian", it does not mean that the people and culture of ''geographical Syria'' are identical to those of ''geographical Assyria''."&lt;ref&gt;Silvio Zaorani (Turin, 1993) under the chapter entitled "The Modern Assyrians - Name and Nation", pp. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt;

The governments of [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]] and [[Armenia]] recognise Assyrians as a distinct ethnic group.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Genetic continuity===
A series of modern Genetic Studies have shown that the modern Assyrians from Northern Iraq, Southeastern Turkey, Northwestern Iran and Northeastern Syria are in a genetic sense one homogenous people, ''regardless'' of which church they belong to (e.g. Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic, Syriac Orthodox, Assyrian Protestant). Furthermore, their collective genetic profile differs from neighbouring [[Syrian people|Syrians]], [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Levantine]] [[Syriac Christians]], [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], [[Iranian people|Iranians]], [[Arab people|Arabs]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Armenian people|Armenians]], [[Jewish people|Jews]], [[Yezidi]]s, [[Shabaki]]s, [[Greek people|Greeks]], [[Georgian people|Georgians]], [[Circassian people|Circassians]], [[Turkmen people|Turcomans]], [[Maronite Christians]], [[Egyptians]] and [[Mandeans]].&lt;ref name="Elias"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M.T.

===Political issues===
[[Mordechai Nisan]], the Israeli Orientalist, also supports the view that Assyrians should be named specifically as such in an ethnic and national sense, are the descendants of their ancient namesakes, and denied self-expression for political, ethnic and religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Nisan, M. 2002. ''Minorities in the Middle East: A History of Struggle for Self Expression''.  Jefferson: McFarland &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dr. Arian Ishaya]] a historian and [[Anthropologist]] of [[UCLA]] states that the confusion of names applied to the Assyrians, and a denial of Assyrian identity and continuity, is on one hand borne out of 19th and early 20th century imperialistic, condescending and arrogant meddling by ''westerners'', rather than by historical fact, and on the other hand by long held [[Islamic]], [[Arab]], [[Kurdistan|Kurdish]], [[Turkey|Turkish]] and [[Iran]]ian policies, whose purpose is to, divide the Assyrian people along false lines and deny their singular identity, with the aim of preventing the Assyrians having any chance of unity, self-expression and potential statehood.&lt;ref name="Nineveh"&gt;"Intellectual Domination and the Assyrians".

[[Naum Elias Yaqub Palakh]] (better known as [[Naum Faiq]]), a 19th-century advocate of [[Assyrian nationalism]] from the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] community in [[Diyarbakir]], encouraged Assyrians to unite regardless of tribal and theological differences&lt;ref&gt;"Neo-Assyrianism &amp; the End of the Confounded Identity". Zinda. 2006-07-06. "The fact remains that throughout the last seven years and the last 150 years for that matter the name Assyrian has always been attached to our political ambitions in the Middle East. Any time, any one of us from any of our church and tribal groups targets a political goal we present our case as Assyrians, Chaldean-Assyrians, or Syriac-Assyrians – making a connection to our "Assyrian" heritage. This is because our politics have always been Assyrian. Men like Naum Faiq and David Perley emerging from a "Syriac" or "Jacobite" background understood this as well as our Chaldean heroes, General Agha Petros d-Baz and the late Chaldean Patriarch Mar Raphael BiDawid."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ashur Yousif]], an Assyrian Protestant from the same region of south eastern Turkey as Faiq also espoused Assyrian unity during the early 20th century, stating that the Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic and Syriac Orthodox were one people, divided purely upon religious lines.&lt;ref&gt;''"The hindrance before the advancement of the Assyrian people was not so much the attacks from without as it was from within, the doctrinal and sectarian disputes and struggles, like Monophysitism (One nature of Christ) Dyophysitism (Two natures of Christ) is a good example, these caused division, spiritually, and nationally, among the people who quarreled among themselves even to the point of shedding blood. To this very day the Assyrians are still known by various names, such as Nestorians, Jacobites, Chaldeans"''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freydun Atturaya]] ([[Freydon Bet-Abram Atoraya]]) also advocated Assyrian unity and was a staunch supporter of Assyrian identity and nationalism and the formation of an ancestral [[Assyrian homeland]] in the wake of the [[Assyrian genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;Aprim, Fred.

===Linguistic continuity===
By the 3rd century AD at the very latest, Akkadian was extinct, although some loaned vocabulary and grammatical features still survives in the Eastern Aramaic dialects of the Assyrians to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Akkadian Words in Modern Assyrian&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Stephen A. (1974). ''The Akkadian influences on Aramaic''. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. A Brinkman]] theorises that the Aramaic language took over because of its simple alphabet and structure as opposed to the 600-700 syllables of the unwieldy [[Assyro-Babylonian]] language.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

As linguist [[Geoffrey Khan]] points out that a number of vocabulary and grammatical features in the colloquial modern neo-Aramaic dialects spoken by the Assyrians shows similarities with the ancient [[Akkadian language]], whereas significantly, the now near extinct [[Western Aramaic]] dialects of the [[Arameans]] (''Oromoyo''), [[Phoenicians]], [[Nabateans]], [[Jews]] and Levantine Syriacs of [[Syria]] and the [[Levant]] do not.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} This indicates that the Assyrian Eastern Aramaic dialects gradually replaced Akkadian among the Assyrian populace, and that they were both influenced by and overlaid the earlier Assyrian Akkadian tongue of the region, unlike Aramaic dialects spoken in the Levant.&lt;ref name="Khan_6"&gt;{{harvnb|Khan|2008|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example is the use of the prefixed article k- or other variants of it such as ki- and či- which does not appear in classical Syriac.&lt;ref name=Khan2&gt;{{Harvnb|Khan|2008|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of the existence of an earlier language which differs from Classical Syriac can be found in other medieval texts such as an Arabic medical book that was composed by [[Ibn Baklarish]] in [[al-Andalus|Spain]]. The book lists a number of medical elements in a variety of languages including one designated as ''al-suryāniyya'' which would presumably correspond with Syriac. The words listed under it are not Classical Syriac however, but correspond to forms found only in the modern Assyrian dialects spoken to the east of the [[Tigris]].&lt;ref name=Khan3&gt;{{Harvnb|Khan|2008|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another distinguishing grammatical feature of modern [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Assyrian]] which differs from [[Syriac language|Syriac]] is the inflection of past verbs by a series of suffixes that contain the preposition ''l-'', e.g. ''grišle'' 'he pulled' and ''grišli'' 'I pulled' compared with the Syriac ''graš'' and ''gerešt'' respectively. The use of this suffix has been attested to Aramaic documents dating back to the 5th century B.C.&lt;ref name=Khan3/&gt; This verbal form is originally a passive construction consisting of a passive participle and an agentive phrase. Examples of this passive construction has been later found in [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] and [[Babylonian Talmudic Aramaic]] and even in Syriac. All these forms of Aramaic are however far more frequently expressed by the active verbal form ''graš'', and the passive types are likely to be reflections of the contemporary spoken vernacular that have infiltrated the standard literary language.&lt;ref name=Khan4&gt;{{Harvnb|Khan|2008|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a number of Akkadian words mostly connected with agriculture that have been preserved in modern Syriac vernaculars. One example is the word ''miššara'' 'rice paddy field' which is a direct descendant of the Akkadian ''mušāru''. A number of words in the dialect of [[Bakhdida]] (Qaraqosh) shows the same origin, e.g. ''baxšimə'' 'storeroom (for grain)' from Akkadian ''bīt ḫašīmi'' 'storehouse' and ''raxiṣa'' 'pile of straw' from ''raḫīṣu'' 'pile of harvest produce'.&lt;ref name=Khan5&gt;{{Harvnb|Khan|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some grammatical features that are found in the modern Assyrian dialects are typologically more archaic than the corresponding features in classical Syriac. In the dialect of Qaraqosh, for example, the infinitive of all verbal stems does not have an initial ''m-'', by contrast with Syriac infinitives, which have acquired this prefix by analogy with the participles.&lt;ref name=Khan5/&gt;

[[Simo Parpola]] asserts that Eastern Aramaic had become so entrenched in Assyrian identity that the Greeks regarded the Imperial Aramaic of the Achaemenid Empire during the 5th and 4th centuries BC as ''The Assyrian Language''.{{#tag:ref|'The Greek historian [[Thucydides]] reports that during the Peloponnesian wars (ca. 410 BC) the Athenians intercepted a Persian who was carrying a message from the Great King to Sparta.

Contrary to what their names suggest, these mutually intelligible dialects are ''not'' divided upon Assyrian Church of the East/Chaldean Catholic church/Syriac Orthodox church lines.&lt;ref&gt;Turoyo at ''Ethnologue'' (17th ed., 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|"Based on interviews with community informants, this paper explores socialization for ingroup identity and endogamy among Assyrians in the United States.}}

===Scarcity of Assyrian names in the Christian Era===
One of the main arguments against the continuity hypothesis is the scarcity of Assyrian and Mesopotamian ([[East Semitic]]) pagan personal names among the [[Assyrian Christian]] priests, bishops and other religious figures. This argument has been put forward by [[John Joseph (academic)|John Joseph]], [[Jean Maurice Fiey]] and David Wilmshurst.

Dominican Syriac scholar J.-M. Fiey noted that while Eastern Christian writers wrote extensively about Assyrians and Babylonians, they did not identify with them. Fiey comments, 'I have made indices of my ''Assyrie chretienne'', and have had to align some 50 pages of proper names of people; there is not a single writer who has an 'Assyrian' name.'  Wilmshurst comments, 'The names of thousands of Assyrian and Chaldean Catholic bishops, priests, deacons and scribes between the third and nineteenth centuries are known, and there is not a Sennacherib or Ashurbanipal among them.'&lt;ref&gt;Fiey, "Assyrians ou Arameens?", ''L'Orient Syrien'', 10 (1965) 146–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alive&gt;Jon Joseph, "The Bible and the Assyrians: It Kept Their Memory Alive", ''JAAS'', '''12''', 1 (1998), 70–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilmshurst|2011|p=415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of the continuity hypothesis have argued that it is usual and common for peoples to adopt ''Biblical names'' after undergoing ''Christianisation'', particularly as names such as ''Sennacherib'' and ''Ashurbanipal'' have clear pagan connotations, and thus unlikely to be used by Christian priests, and many were in fact [[throne names]] or eponyms.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} [[Fred Aprim]] has claimed that distinct Assyrian names continued in an unbroken line from ancient times to the present, giving examples of Assyrian personal names used as late as late as 238 AD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fredaprim.com/pdf/Timeline%20Assyrian%20Continuity.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cite web|url=http://www.fredaprim.com/pdf/Timeline%20Assyrian%20Continuity.pdf |title=Timeline |website=www.fredaprim.com |format=PDF}}{{dubious|date=January 2017}} [[Simo Parpola]] argues that Assyrian names remained common into the 4th century AD, only reducing significantly with the adoption of [[Christianity]], this position is supported by [[Richard Nelson Frye]] also.

Similarly, [[Odisho Gewargis]] explained the general scarcity of autochthonous personal names as a process taking place only after Christianization, when peoples generally replace native names with Biblical Names; giving as an example of this the scarcity of traditional ''English names'' such as ''Wolfstan'', ''Redwald'', ''Aethelred'', ''Offa'' and ''Wystan'' among modern Englishmen, compared to the commonality of ''non English biblical names'' such as John, Mark, David, Paul, Thomas, Daniel, Michael, Matthew, Benjamin, Elizabeth, Mary, Joanne, Josephine, Paula, Rebecca, Simone, Ruth etc.{{#tag:ref|"If the children of Sennacherib were, for centuries, taught to pray and damn Babylon and Assyria, how does the researcher expect from people who wholeheartedly accepted the Christian faith to name their children Ashur and Esarhaddon?"&lt;ref&gt;Odisho. ''We Are Assyrians''. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} In response Jon Joseph strongly criticizes this argument as contradictory with Gewargis's other arguments, "Contradicting himself, Mr. Gewargis notes that centuries ago, monks and ecclesiastics of the Eastern churches had 'great praise and exaltation for the Assyrians and their kings, their clergy and their judges and obvious downgrading of the prophets, clergy, kings and the elders of Israel. Thus one can say,' he concludes, that Sabhrisho, and monk Yaqqira and patriarch Ishoyabh 'were Assyrians filled with national pride.' We have here an unusual situation: 1. The Church fathers proudly calling themselves 'Aturaye'; 2. The common people, members of the church, for centuries calling themselves 'Suryaye'; 3. And Mr. Gewargis, an Aramaic-language expert who won't tell us the difference between these two Aramaic words, Aturaye and Suryaye."&lt;ref name=response/&gt; Many Old English personal names, such as Edward and Audrey, remain popular in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthename.com/name/edward|title=Meaning, origin and history of the name Edward|first=Mike|last=Campbell|website=Behind the Name}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthename.com/name/audrey|title=Meaning, origin and history of the name Audrey|first=Mike|last=Campbell|website=Behind the Name}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other naming controversies===
Kelly L. Ross notes that the oldest reference to the 'Christians' of Iraq is as "Nestorians", a term used by Cosmas Indicopleustes in 525 AD, though she acknowledges that this is a 'doctrinal' term and not an ethnic one. [[Hannibal Travis]], in contrast, argues that "Assyrian" is the ''oldest'' name for this community, a majority opinion among modern scholars.&lt;ref name=refugees/&gt; [[Artur Boháč]] ehoes Hannibal Travis in arguing that the confusion of later names applied to the Assyrians were introduced by Western theologians and missionaries, and others arose out of doctrinal rather than ethnic divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conference.osu.eu/globalization/publ/08-bohac.pdf |title=Summary |website=conference.osu.eu |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hitti, Philip Khuri 1957"&gt;Hitti, Philip Khuri (1957). ''History of Syria, including Lebanon and Palestine''. Macmillan; St. Martin's P.: London, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Travis, Hannibal 2010, pp. 237-77"&gt;Travis, Hannibal. ''Genocide in the Middle East: The Ottoman Empire, Iraq, and Sudan''. Durham, NC: Carolina Academic Press, 2010, 2007, pp. 237-77, 293–294.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assyrians often reject the label of "Nestorian" even in a theological sense, the Assyrian Church both predating Nestorianism and being doctrinally distinct. [[Philip Hitti]] stated that it is an inaccurate term both chronologically and theologically and has no ethnic meaning.&lt;ref name="Hitti, Philip Khuri 1957"/&gt;

====Chaldean identity====
In recent times, a small and mainly [[United States]]-based minority within the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] have begun to espouse a separate Chaldean ethnic identity. They assert that they are a different and separate race to the modern Assyrians, and are the direct descendants of the [[Chaldea]]ns of southeast Mesopotamia. This is only a minority viewpoint among Chaldean Catholics.

Chaldean Catholics were former members of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], who entered into communion with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] between the 16th and 18th centuries, after failing to gain acceptance into the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]. Most [[Chaldo-Assyrian]] communities consider the term Chaldean to be purely doctrinal, the name of a church only, with no implication or meaning in an ethnic, cultural or historical sense.  Acute Assyrian nationalism began shortly after the [[Assyrian Genocide]] in World War I, with Assyrian groups seeking a state of their own in the Assyrian homeland. Meanwhile, a ''Chaldean'' nationalism is largely non-existent, and if a Chaldean state were established it would not reasonably be in historic [[Chaldea]] which was in the extreme south east of Iraq, a different region to where the Chaldean Catholic church emerged.

The [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] was pointedly originally named the ''Church of Assyria and Mosul'' and its first leader ''Patriarch of the Eastern Assyrians'' circa 1550 AD, and was changed to distinguish its members from the Assyrian Church of the East in 1683 AD, with the modern Chaldean Catholic Church only coming into being in 1830 AD. Its founders and members were all from the [[Assyrian Homeland]] in northern Mesopotamia (what was Assyria), rather than the far south east of Mesopotamia where the Ancient Chaldeans migrated to in the 9th century BC, and where they also disappeared from history in the 6th century BC, and no link has been provided linking these people to the Chaldea or Chaldeans of old.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In an interview with [[Raphael I Bidawid]], head of the Chaldean Catholic Church between 1989 and 2003, published in 2003, he commented on the [[Assyrian name dispute]] and distinguished between what is merely the name of a church and an actual ethnicity:

:"''I personally think that these different names serve to add confusion. The original name of our Church was the 'Church of the East' ... When a portion of the Church of the East became Catholic, the name given was 'Chaldean' based on the Magi kings who came from the land of the Chaldean, to Bethlehem. The name 'Chaldean' does not represent an ethnicity... We have to separate what is ethnicity and what is religion... I myself, my sect is Chaldean, but ethnically, I am Assyrian.''"&lt;ref name="Parpola"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Parpola, Simo |year=2004 |title=National and Ethnic Identity in the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Assyrian Identity in Post-Empire Times |journal=[[Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies]] |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=22 |publisher=JAAS |url=http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf |format=PDF |authorlink=Simo Parpola |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717071922/http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of a [[Chaldean continuity]] or separateness from Assyrians sometimes claim that they are separate because they speak [[Chaldean Neo Aramaic]] rather than [[Assyrian Neo Aramaic]]. However, both of these appellations are only 20th century labels applied by modern linguists to regions where one ''church'' was seen to be more prevalent than another for convenience, with no historical continuity or ethnic context implied in either. They are also wholly inaccurate; many speakers of Chaldean Neo Aramaic are in fact members of the Assyrian Church of the East, Assyrian Pentecostal, Evangelical Churches or Syriac Orthodox Church,&lt;ref&gt;Nordhoff, Sebastian; Hammarström, Harald; Forkel, Robert; Haspelmath, Martin, eds. (2013). "Northeastern Neo-Aramaic". Glottolog 2.2. Leipzig: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.&lt;/ref&gt; and equally, many speakers of Assyrian Neo Aramaic are members of the Chaldean Catholic Church or Syriac Orthodox Church. This is also true of the [[Turoyo language|Surayt/Turoyo]] dialect, and minority dialects such as [[Hértevin]], [[Koy Sanjaq Surat]], [[Bohtan Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Senaya]]. Furthermore, each of these dialects originated in [[Assyria]], evolving from the 8th century BC [[Imperial Aramaic]] of the [[Assyrian Empire]] and 5th century BC [[Syriac language|Syriac]] of [[Achaemenid Assyria]].

The term ''Chaldeans'' has been misapplied to other peoples with no link to ancient Chaldea, having been previously officially used by the [[Council of Florence]] in 1445 as a new name for a group of [[Greek people|Greek]] Christians of [[Cyprus]] who entered in [[Full Communion]] with the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Council of Florence, ''Bull of union with the Chaldeans and the Maronites of Cyprus'' Session 14, 7 August 1445 [http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Councils/ecum17.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Rome followed to use the term ''Chaldeans'' to indicate the members of the Church of the East in Communion with Rome, mainly not to use the terms ''Assyrian'', ''Syrian'' and ''Nestorian'' that had connotations to theologically unacceptable doctrines. Rome had also long previously misapplied the name to [[Chaldia]],&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Bryer, "Greeks and Türkmens: The Pontic Exception". ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'', 29 (1975), p.&lt;/ref&gt; a people and region in [[Anatolia]], and The term "Chaldean" was also used in a similar generic fashion in the 10th century by [[Liutprand of Cremona]].

The '''Australian Conservatives''' is an Australian [[political party]] formed and led by [[Cory Bernardi]] as a breakaway from the [[Liberal Party of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservatives.org.au/about|title=About|work=conservatives.org.au|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party had been established as a conservative political activist group in July 2016, as response to the results of the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]]. It was formed as a political party after Bernardi's resignation from the Liberals, following disagreements with the [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal/National Coalition]], its policies and leadership under [[Malcolm Turnbull]]. The [[Family First Party]] and their two state incumbents [[Dennis Hood]] and [[Robert Brokenshire]] joined and merged with the Australian Conservatives in April 2017. Brokenshire was not re-elected at the [[South Australian state election, 2018|2018 state election]]; Hood left the Conservatives to join the [[Liberal Party of Australia (South Australian Division)|Liberal Party of Australia]] on 26 March 2018.&lt;ref name="Hood"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-26/australian-conservatives-mp-dennis-hood-joins-liberals/9586822 |title=Dennis Hood dumps Cory Bernardi's Australian Conservatives to join SA Liberals |first=Nick |last=Harmsen |newspaper=ABC News |date=26 March 2018 |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Activist group===
The Australian Conservatives were established by Senator Bernardi as a conservative [[activism|political activist]] group on 6 July 2016.&lt;ref name="guardian-1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karp|first1=Paul|title=Cory Bernardi establishes rightwing movement Australian Conservatives|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/06/cory-bernardi-establishes-rightwing-movement-australian-conservatives|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=7 February 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207030534/https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/06/cory-bernardi-establishes-rightwing-movement-australian-conservatives|archivedate=7 February 2017|date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernardi cited the results of the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]] as a motivator for the group's establishment, stating that "over 1.7m votes were cast for right-of-centre or conservative parties rather than the Liberals", and that "the clear mission now is to bring people together for the good of the country."&lt;ref name="guardian-1"/&gt;

===Merger with Family First===
On 25 April 2017, it was announced that the [[Family First Party]] would merge with the Australian Conservatives, with its two members of the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] joining the party.&lt;ref name="merger-aus"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Antony|title=The Urge to merge – Family First and the Australian Conservatives |url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2017/04/the-urge-to-merge-family-first-and-the-australian-conservatives.html |accessdate=4 May 2017 |work=ABC |date=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newly-appointed Family First senator [[Lucy Gichuhi]] did not join the Conservatives, and became an independent senator when Family First was disbanded.&lt;ref name="merger-abc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bernardi's Australian Conservatives to merge with Family First|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-25/cory-bernardi-australian-conservatices-to-merge-with-family/8471244?smid=abcnews-Twitter_Organic&amp;WT.tsrc=Twitter_Organic&amp;sf73113548=1|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=ABC News|date=25 April 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gichuhi was invited to join the Australian Conservatives' voting bloc in the Senate,&lt;ref name="bloc"/&gt; but ultimately chose to join the Liberal Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/australian-success-story-pm-welcomes-gichuhi-to-liberals|title='Australian success story': PM welcomes Gichuhi to Liberals|work=SBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family First was generally considered to be part of the [[Christian right]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Though it had no formal affiliation with any particular religious organisation, Family First was strongly linked to the [[Pentecostal church]] in South Australia, and nationally with smaller Christian denominations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Family First in South Australia was viewed as an infusion of ex-[[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberals]] via [[Robert Brokenshire]] and [[Bob Day]]. The party advocated a moral and family values agenda, but Day, who would become Family First's major donor, later reoriented Family First to emphasise issues such as industrial relations reform, free speech and smaller government, which brought Family First closer to Bernardi's Conservatives.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

However,according to John Macaulay, an executive of the Australian Conservatives Board, and the dissolution document of Family First, the Party did not merge with the Australian Conservtives. The Family First executive voted to dissolve the party, and in accordance with Australian law, they donated all their assets to the Australian Conservative Party. &lt;ref&gt;Family First Dissolution Document&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2018}}

===Electoral performance===
The party made modest showings at the [[Bennelong by-election, 2017| 2017 Bennelong]] and [[Batman by-election, 2018|2018 Batman]] by-elections, achieving primary vote of 4.29% and 6.41%, respectively, the latter in the absence of [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] candidate, failing to elect a candidate in either instance. In March 2018, the party lost both upper house representatives in the [[South Australian Legislative Council]], with the failure to reelect [[Robert Brokenshire]], and the defection of parliamentary leader [[Dennis Hood]] to the Liberal Party, which nine days prior had won government in the [[South Australian state election, 2018|state election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cory Bernardi lashes out at former colleagues over 'plans to defect to Liberals'|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-28/bernardi-feels-whiteanted-by-former-conservative-colleagues/9598048|accessdate=28 March 2018|work=ABC News|date=28 March 2018|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the election, the Australian Conservatives suffered a −3.2% swing (from a Family First vote of 6.2% in [[South Australian state election, 2014|2014]]) for a lower house primary vote of 3.0%, and a −0.9% swing (from a Family First vote of 4.4% in 2014) for an upper house primary vote of 3.5%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/sa-election-2018/results/ 2018 SA election results: ABC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://results.ecsa.sa.gov.au 2018 SA election results: ECSA]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canadian Legal Information Institute''' ('''CanLII'''; {{lang-fr|Institut canadien d'information juridique}}) is a non-profit organization created and funded by the [[Federation of Law Societies of Canada]] on behalf of its 14 member societies. CanLII is a member of the [[Free Access to Law Movement]], which includes the primary stakeholders involved in free, open publication of law throughout the world.

CanLII offers free public access to over 2.4 million documents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.canlii.org/en/#search/ |title=CanLII - Search all CanLII Databases |publisher=Canlii.ca |date= |accessdate=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; across more than 300 case law and legislative databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/databases.html |title=CanLII - Scope of CanLII's Databases |publisher=Canlii.ca |date= |accessdate=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by lawyers, legal professionals and the general public, with usage averaging over 30,000 visits per day. The case law database is reportedly growing at a rate of approximately 120,000 new cases each year, 20% of which are historic cases which are included to enrich existing databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.droit-inc.com/article7076-Un-million-de-decisions |title=Un million de décisions... |publisher=droit-inc.com |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, CanLII launched CanLII Connects, a legal community sourced publication and discussion platform for case law summaries and commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CanLII Connects!|url=http://nationalmagazine.ca/Blog/April-2014/CanLII-Connects!.aspx|website=National Magazine|publisher=Canadian Bar Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CanLII Connects website connects accessible law to Canadians|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2014/04/04/canlii-connects-website-connects-accessible-law-to-canadians/|publisher=Financial Post|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The CBRL was established in 1998 as an amalgamation of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem (now the Kenyon Institute) and the British Institute at Amman for Archaeology and History (now the British Institute in Amman).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While its predecessors mainly existed to support [[Archaeology|archaeological research]] in their respective host countries, the newly formed CBRL, sponsored by the [[British Academy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cbrl.org.uk/about-us/who-funds-us|title=Who funds us|website=CBRL website|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/intl/index-basis.cfm|title=Academy-Sponsored Institutes|website=British Academy website|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; broadened its remit to include research into the history, culture and society of the entire Levant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Plans to open a CBRL institute in [[Damascus]] have been suspended due the ongoing [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Deviants''' are a [[List of fictional humanoid species|fictional race]] of [[humanoid]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}

The Deviants first appeared in ''[[Eternals (comics)|The Eternals]]'' #1 (July 1976), and were created by [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional history==
They are an offshoot of the evolutionary process that created sentient life on Earth instigated by the alien [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], and wage war against their counterparts, the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]]. According to the account of one Deviant in the 2006 mini-series,&lt;ref&gt;''Eternals'' #5 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; the Deviants were created as a delicacy to be consumed ''en masse'' by Celestials at periodic intervals once they multiplied sufficiently; however, the veracity of this has yet to be proven.

While the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] possess godlike power and are generally physically beautiful (by human standards), the Deviants (who sometimes refer to themselves as 'the changing people') are for the most part hideous (again, by human standards), with each member of their race possessing some random physical and/or cosmetic [[mutation]] that is by Celestial design never repeated within the sub-species. Extremely mutated or deformed Deviants are referred to as "[[Mutate (comics)#Non-human mutates|mutates]]" and some of the monsters of myth and legend have in fact been identified as Deviant mutates. Some of these mutations can provide [[superhuman]] abilities, but their powers are usually not as great as those of the Eternals.

The Deviants are religious, revering the [[Dreaming Celestial]] ("He Who Sleeps in Darkness"). They credit him with their creation and claim that he granted them dominion over the Earth, an agreement they believe was later broken by the treachery of the other Celestials. They have one or more holy books—the only one named thus far being the ''Book of Krask''.

The Deviants had already developed advanced technology such as [[genetic engineering]] when humans were still living in caves.

An '''Eco-tariff''', also known as an '''environmental tariff''', is a [[trade barrier]] erected for the purpose of reducing pollution and improving the environment. These trade barriers may take the form of [[import tax|import]] or [[export tax|export taxes]] on products that have a large [[carbon footprint]] or are imported from countries with lax environmental regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mani|first=Muthukumara S.|date=1996|title=Environmental tariffs on polluting imports|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00369626|journal=Environmental and Resource Economics|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=391–411|doi=10.1007/bf00369626|issn=0924-6460|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-AABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=%22environmental+tariffs%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u0n41Rqu7H&amp;sig=oQmqUHlaxWFPz4Pr0V7uv2qD7E4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFrKn66NbbAhVFI1AKHaBACh84ChDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22environmental%20tariffs%22&amp;f=false|title=Essential Concepts of Global Environmental Governance|last=Morin|first=Jean-Frédéric|last2=Orsini|first2=Amandine|date=2014-07-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136777042|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kraus2"&gt;Kraus, Christiane (2000), ''Import Tariffs as Environmental Policy Instruments'', Springer, {{ISBN|0-7923-6318-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7923-6318-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International trade vs. environmental degradation ==

There has been debate on the role that increased [[international trade]] has played in increasing pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Horvath, John [http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/8/8660/1.html Salami Tactics], Telepolis, at Heise.de online, 2000. Retrieved 2009-10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  While some{{who|date=July 2017}} maintain that increases in pollution which result in both local [[environmental degradation]] and a global ''[[tragedy of the commons]]'' are intimately linked to increases in international trade, others have argued that as citizens become more affluent they'll also advocate for cleaner environments.   According to a [[World Bank]] paper:
: "Since freer trade raises income, it directly contributes to increasing pollution levels via the scale effect.  However, it thereby induces the composition (and) technique effects of increased income, both of which tend to reduce pollution levels".&lt;ref name="Fredricksson2"&gt;''Trade, Global Policy, and the Environment'', Pg. 56, Fredriksson, World Bank, World Bank Publications, 1999, {{ISBN|0-8213-4458-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8213-4458-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean2"&gt;Dean, Judith M &amp; Lovely, Mary E (2008), ''Trade Growth, Production Fragmentation, and China's Environment'', Pgs. 3 &amp; 5, National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper 13860, Cambridge, MA [http://www.wm.edu/as/economics/research/seminars/seminardocs/Dean.pdf &lt;nowiki&gt;[2]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Proponents of environmental tariff implementation have highlighted that if implemented correctly, the tariff could serve to stop strategic behavior of foreign nations and return efficient economic policy in the foreign country. Additionally, environmental standards will be harmonized between the trading nations as a result of the environmental tariff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xing|first=Yuqing|year=2006|title=Strategic Environmental Policy and Environmental Tariffs|url=|journal=Journal of Economic Integration|volume=|pages=861–880|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major issues that are raised when discussing environmental tariffs, is the issue of a reduction in trade. The argument raised is that tariffs reduce trade and may not actually be targeting the actual source of the pollution. They argue that pollution is not just as a result of imported goods but a large part of pollution suffered occurs within the borders of a country, therefore trade would merely harming trade without actually addressing the root cause effectively.

== Early tariff implementation proposal ==
Although the [[United States]] has in the past been accused of dragging its feet on implementing tough new anti-pollution measures, it was the originator of a legislative proposal suggesting an environmental tariff be applied against exporting countries whose exports gained significant cost advantages due to less stringent environmental regulations.  The proposed legislation was tabled as the '''International Pollution Deterrence Act of 1991''' and was introduced in its Senate in April of that year.&lt;ref name="WB2"&gt;''International Trade and Climate Change: Economic, Legal, and Institutional Perspectives'' Pg. 36, World Bank Publications, 2007, {{ISBN|0-8213-7225-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8213-7225-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Doha Ministerial Declaration ===
Negotiations took place in 2001 [[Doha]], [[Qatar]] towards the improvement of work related issues concerning the implementation of present agreements. This was a mandated conference dubbed the Fourth Ministerial Conference. One of the issues discussed concerned the issues of trade barriers on environmental goods and services. The result of which was ministers agreeing to a reduction or complete removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods and services such as catalytic converters and air filters to name a few.

=== Proposed International Pollution Control Index ===
A notable feature of the proposed U.S. ''International Pollution Deterrence Act'' was the international pollution control index it cited within its Section 5, which read:&lt;ref name="Thomas2"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c102:S.984.IS: S 984 IS: International Pollution Deterrence Act of 1991 (Introduced in Senate)] U.S. Congress Thomas online database, 102nd Congress, 1st session, 25 April 1991. Retrieved 2009-06-07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;'''INTERNATIONAL POLLUTION CONTROL INDEX'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Section 8002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6982) is amended by adding the following new subsections at the end thereof:
 `(t) The Administrator shall prepare, within one hundred and twenty days of the enactment of this section and yearly thereafter, a pollution control index for each of the top fifty countries identified by the Office of Trade and Investment of the Department of Commerce based on the value of exports to the United States from that country's attainment of pollution control standards in the areas of air, water, hazardous waste and solid waste as compared to the United States. The purpose of this index is to measure the level of compliance within each country with standards comparable to or greater than those in the United States. The Administrator shall analyze, in particular, the level of technology employed and actual costs incurred for pollution control in the major export sectors of each country in formulating the index.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Implementation problems and resistance ==
Environmental tariffs may result in the movement in production of goods to areas in which stricter [[environmental standards]] are enforced. Environment tariffs were not implemented in the past, in part, because they were not sanctioned by multilateral trade regimes such as the [[World Trade Organization]] and within the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), a fact which generated considerable criticism and calls for reform.&lt;ref name="Kraus2" /&gt;

Moreover, the [[GATT]] does condone the use of tariffs as market interventions, so long as the interventions do not discriminate products, both foreign and domestic. A disputed case relating to this policy was brought forth to the [[GATT]]/[[WTO]], involving the U.S. and Canada over Canadian environmental regulations on beverage containers.

Additionally, many foreign factory owners in [[newly industrialized countries]] and underdeveloped countries saw the attempts to impose pollution controls on them as suspicious...
: "...seeing it as a threat to their growth and fearing that developed countries would attempt to export their preferences for pollution control or to place 'environmental' tariffs on imports from countries with lower standards."&lt;ref name="Leonard2"&gt;Leonard, Jeffrey H., 1988, ''Pollution and the Struggle for the World Product: Multinational Corporations, Environment, and International Comparative Advantage'' Pg. 69, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-34042-X}}, 9780521340427&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, the problem of what the ideal tariff level is also a cause for concern when implementing environmental tariffs.

Further implementation problems have been as a result of what some developing nations may view as green protectionism. Green protectionism being the use of methods meant to address legitimate environment goals for the end goal of protection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12885">[[Chris Roebuck | Roebuck]], referencing Roebuck (2004),{{cn|date=July 2017}} defines '''entrepreneurial leadership''' as "organizing a group of people to achieve a common goal using proactive [[entrepreneurship |entrepreneur]]ial behavior by [[risk management |optimising risk]], [[innovation |innovating]] to take advantage of opportunities, taking [[personal responsibility]] and [[managing change]] within a dynamic environment for the benefit of [an] [[organisation]]".&lt;ref&gt;

(Roebuck 2004)
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Such [[leadership]] aims to cultivate entrepreneurial individuals and teams that fully leverage their [[creativity | creative]] potential in [[value creation | creating value]] for an organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite news|url= http://integral-entrepreneurship.org/2016/12/entrepreneurial-leadership-primer/ |title= Entrepreneurial Leadership – A Primer|date= 2016-12-12|newspaper= Institute for Integral Entrepreneurship|language= en-US|access-date= 2016-12-20 | quote = Entrepreneurial Leadership is an emerging leadership paradigm that has grown out of the challenges and opportunities presented by the ongoing digitalisation of society and its workforce. Its aim is to cultivate entrepreneurial teams that fully leverage their creative potential in creating value for the organisation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreneurial leadership does this by employing leadership practices that "develop the ability in [[employee]]s to [[Self-generating | self-generate]], [[Self-reflection | self-reflect]], and [[self-correction | self-correct]] in their workplace".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://integral-entrepreneurship.org/2016/12/entrepreneurial-leadership-primer/ |title= Entrepreneurial Leadership – A Primer|date= 2016-12-12|newspaper= Institute for Integral Entrepreneurship|language= en-US|access-date= 2016-12-20 | quote = It does this by employing leadership practices that develop the ability in employees to self-generate, self-reflect, and self-correct in their workplace.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurial leadership is effectively using the skills associated with successful individual entrepreneurs and applying those within the environment of a larger organisation.{{cn|date=July 2017}} This especially means within an organisation where those skills have been lost{{cn|date=July 2017}} and replaced with a [[corporation | "corporate"]] mindset that focuses on [[business process | process]], [[system]]s and risk minimisation rather than on entrepreneurial behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and theories==
Other definitions of entrepreneurial leadership have also emerged:

An entrepreneurial leader will proactively identify opportunities to gain advantage through creativity, innovation and market understanding and then hoion and the customer.&lt;ref name="chrisroebuck.co"&gt;http://chrisroebuck.co/media/tv-and-radio-interviews/1299-2/&lt;/ref&gt;j

==Attributes of an entrepreneurial leader==
The [https://www.eship.ox.ac.uk/what-does-it-mean-be-entrepreneurial entrepreneurial] leader will work within a formalised organisational structure, but use the approaches normally expected of an entrepreneur to identify opportunities. Once an opportunity has been identified, they work towards creating a value proposition which will enable a rapid testing of their key assumptions. Next to an effective management of risk (rather than the minimisation of risk often sought within corporate environments), they are required to operate with contextual awareness in order to create a value proposition that delivers value to the customer while taking into account the organisational requirements and strategic aims. The entrepreneurial leader must have the ability to learn fast and within environments of ambiguity and change, while providing clarity and coherence for those around them.&lt;ref name="1000ventures.com"&gt;http://www.1000ventures.com/business_guide/crosscuttings/leadership_entrepreneurial.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2011/09/CEO-Entrepreneur-Article-March-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="legacee.com"&gt;http://www.legacee.com/Info/Leadership/LeadershipEntrepreneurial.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The entrepreneurial leader takes responsibility for their actions and those actions must be more proactive than reactive. They think about achieving organisational outcomes in an innovative way and working with a diverse group of people and resources to achieve these goals.&lt;ref name="legacee.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=347&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ACf6aSDfbc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srcaMjhsWtI&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
Perhaps the best known and most widely considered example of an entrepreneurial leader is [[Steve Jobs]],&lt;ref&gt;http://chrisroebuck.co/blog/steve-jobs-a-true-transformational-leader/&lt;/ref&gt; but there are many real life examples in the world of business and other industries, such as [[Bill Gates]], [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and [[Richard Branson]].&lt;ref name="1000ventures.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chrisroebuck.co"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://4entrepreneur.net/2007/09/19/11-principles-of-entrepreneurial-leadership/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The search for the characteristics or traits of leaders has been ongoing for centuries. History's greatest philosophical writings from Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' to Plutarch's ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]]'' have explored the question "What qualities distinguish an individual as a leader?". Underlying this search was the early recognition of the importance of leadership and the assumption that leadership is rooted in the characteristics that certain individuals possess. This idea that leadership is based on individual attributes is known as the "[[trait theory|trait theory of leadership]]".

The concept of entrepreneurial leadership was introduced in 2000 by [[Rita Gunther McGrath|McGrath]] and MacMillan who suggested that in dynamic markets where there is increased uncertainty and competitive pressure a new type of leader is required. They described this as the "entrepreneurial leader". These fast changing markets or situations give those with an "entrepreneurial" approach the ability to exploit opportunities to gain advantage for their organisation faster than others.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, R. G. &amp; MacMillan, I. C. 2000. The entrepreneurial mindset : strategies for continuously creating opportunity in an age of uncertainty. Boston, Mass.: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of organisations have sought to develop the concept of entrepreneurial leadership within the business world. A good example is UBS, the global bank, which in the period 2002 to 2006 proactively developed entrepreneurial leadership amongst its top 500 leaders. The success of this was demonstrated by improvements in individual, team and financial performance, the project becoming a key element in the Harvard Business School Case study, "UBS Aligning the Integrated firm". The bank was subsequently awarded the title Best Company for Leaders (Europe) 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inspireimagineinnovate.com/pdf/Top_Companies_2005_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of this project over a multi divisional bank spread globally was complex and took a number of years. This is reviewed in a case study by Chris Roebuck, Visiting Professor of Transformational Leadership at Cass Business School in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2011/10/UBS-Case-study-final-Nov-2011-v2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231722/http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2011/10/UBS-Case-study-final-Nov-2011-v2.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roebuck was one of the leaders of the team who implemented entrepreneurial leadership in UBS.

The principles of entrepreneurial leadership can be applied to a number of sectors and to a wide variety of organisations. The success of this approach has confirmed the compatibility of entrepreneurial leadership to the majority of organisations seeking to improve client/customer service and overall performance.

Prof Chris Roebuck notes that in recent examples of applying entrepreneurial leadership to organisations, the link to employee engagement has increasingly become as a key success factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2012/11/In-My-Opinion-NOv-2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723135817/http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2012/11/In-My-Opinion-NOv-2012.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also allowed development of the concept of entrepreneurial support functions, such as Entrepreneurial HR and Entrepreneurial IT, to support the customer or client facing parts of organisations.&lt;ref&gt;http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2011/08/Different-Slant-Chris-roebuck-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurial Leadership is not so much a style of leadership as a focus of leadership and employees' efforts on specific actions that either maximise the effectiveness of service delivery currently or seek to improve it in the future.

==&lt;!-- The styles of leadership do not describe styles of Entrepreneurial Leadership. This section should thus be removed. --&gt;Styles of leadership==
Leadership style refers to a leader's behavior. It is the result of the philosophy, personality, and experience of the leader. Rhetoric specialists have also developed models for understanding leadership ([[Robert Hariman]], ''Political Style'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hariman]], Political Style, U of Chicago Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination''&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination'', Paris, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Participative or democratic style===
The democratic leadership style favors decision-making by the group. Such a leader gives instructions after consulting the group. They can win the cooperation of their group and can motivate them effectively and positively. The decisions of the democratic leader are not unilateral as with the autocrat because they arise from consultation with the group members and participation by them.&lt;ref name=Lewin/&gt;

===Autocratic or authoritarian style===
Under the [[autocratic]] leadership style, all decision-making powers are centralized in the leader, as with [[dictator]]s.

Leaders do not entertain any suggestions or initiatives from subordinates. The autocratic management has been successful as it provides strong motivation to the manager. It permits quick decision-making, as only one person decides for the whole group and keeps each decision to him/herself until he/she feels it needs to be shared with the rest of the group.&lt;ref name=Lewin&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16079">'''Game semantics''' ({{lang-de|dialogische Logik}}, translated as ''dialogical logic'') is an approach to [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]] that grounds the concepts of [[truth]] or [[Validity (logic)|validity]] on [[game theory|game-theoretic]] concepts, such as the existence of a winning strategy for a player, somewhat resembling [[Socratic dialogues]] or medieval [[theory of Obligationes]].

==History==
In the late 1950s [[Paul Lorenzen]] was the first to introduce a game semantics for [[logic]], and it was further developed by [[Kuno Lorenz]]. At almost the same time as Lorenzen, [[Jaakko Hintikka]] developed a model-theoretical approach known in the literature as ''GTS''. Since then, a number of different game semantics have been studied in logic.

Shahid Rahman (Lille) and collaborators developed ''dialogic'' into a general framework for the study of logical and philosophical issues related to logical pluralism. Beginning 1994 this triggered a kind of renaissance with lasting consequences. This new philosophical impulse experienced a parallel renewal in the fields of [[theoretical computer science]], [[computational linguistics]], [[artificial intelligence]] and the [[formal semantics of programming languages]], for instance the work of [[Johan van Benthem (logician)|Johan van Benthem]] and collaborators in [[Amsterdam]] who looked thoroughly at the interface between logic and games, and Hanno Nickau who addressed the full abstraction problem in programming languages by means of games. New results in [[linear logic]] by J-Y. Girard in the interfaces between mathematical game theory and [[logic]] on one hand and [[argumentation theory]] and logic on the other hand resulted in the work of many others, including [[Samson Abramsky|S. Abramsky]], J. van Benthem, [[Andreas Blass|A. Blass]], [[Dov Gabbay|D. Gabbay]], [[Martin Hyland|M. Hyland]], [[Wilfred Hodges|W. Hodges]], R. Jagadeesan, [[Giorgi Japaridze|G. Japaridze]], E. Krabbe, L. Ong, H. Prakken, G. Sandu D. Walton, and J. Woods who placed game semantics at the center of a new concept in logic in which logic is understood as a dynamic instrument of inference.

==Classical logic==
The simplest application of game semantics is to [[propositional logic]]. Each formula of this language is interpreted as a game between two players, known as the "Verifier" and the "Falsifier". The Verifier is given "ownership" of all the [[disjunction]]s in the formula, and the Falsifier is likewise given ownership of all the [[Logical conjunction|conjunctions]]. Each move of the game consists of allowing the owner of the dominant connective to pick one of its branches; play will then continue in that subformula, with whichever player controls its dominant connective making the next move. Play ends when a primitive proposition has been so chosen by the two players; at this point the Verifier is deemed the winner if the resulting proposition is true, and the Falsifier is deemed the winner if it is false. The original formula will be considered true precisely when the Verifier has a [[winning strategy]], while it will be false whenever the Falsifier has the winning strategy.

If the formula contains negations or implications, other, more complicated, techniques may be used. For example, a [[negation]] should be true if the thing negated is false, so it must have the effect of interchanging the roles of the two players.

More generally, game semantics may be applied to [[predicate logic]]; the new rules allow a dominant [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]] to be removed by its "owner" (the Verifier for [[existential quantifier]]s and the Falsifier for [[universal quantifier]]s) and its [[bound variable]] replaced at all occurrences by an object of the owner's choosing, drawn from the [[domain of quantification]]. Note that a single counterexample falsifies a universally quantified statement, and a single example suffices to verify an existentially quantified one. Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], the game-theoretical semantics for classical [[first-order logic]] agree with the usual [[First-order logic#Semantics|model-based (Tarskian) semantics]]. For classical first-order logic the winning strategy for the verifier essentially consists of finding adequate [[Skolem function]]s and [[Witness (mathematics)|witnesses]]. For example, if ''S'' denotes &lt;math&gt;\forall x \exists y\, \phi(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; then an [[equisatisfiable]] statement for ''S'' is &lt;math&gt;\exists f \forall x \, \phi(x,f(x))&lt;/math&gt;. The Skolem function ''f'' (if it exists) actually codifies a winning strategy for the verifier of ''S'' by returning a witness for the existential sub-formula for every choice of ''x'' the falsifier might make.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaakko Hintikka|J. Hintikka]] and G. Sandu, 2009, "Game-Theoretical Semantics" in Keith Allan (ed.) ''Concise Encyclopedia of Semantics'', Elsevier, {{ISBN|0-08095-968-7}}, pp. 341&amp;ndash;343&lt;/ref&gt;

The above definition was first formulated by Jaakko Hintikka as part of his GTS interpretation. The original version of game semantics for classical (and intuitionistic) logic due to Paul Lorenzen and Kuno Lorenz was not defined in terms of models but of winning strategies over ''formal dialogues'' (P. Lorenzen, K. Lorenz 1978, S. Rahman and L. Keiff 2005). Shahid Rahman and Tero Tulenheimo developed an algorithm to convert GTS-winning strategies for classical logic into the dialogical winning strategies and vice versa.

For most common logics, including the ones above, the games that arise from them have [[perfect information]]—that is, the two players always know the [[truth value]]s of each primitive, and are aware of all preceding moves in the game. However, with the advent of game semantics, logics, such as the [[independence-friendly logic]] of Hintikka and Sandu, with a natural semantics in terms of games of imperfect information have been proposed.

== Intuitionistic logic, denotational semantics, linear logic, logical pluralism ==
The primary motivation for Lorenzen and Kuno Lorenz was to find a game-theoretic (their term was "dialogical" ''Dialogische Logik'') semantics for [[intuitionistic logic]]. [[Andreas Blass]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~ablass/ Andreas R. Blass&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to point out connections between game semantics and [[linear logic]]. This line was further developed by [[Samson Abramsky]], [[Radhakrishnan Jagadeesan]], [[Pasquale Malacaria]] and independently [[Martin Hyland]] and [http://users.comlab.ox.ac.uk/luke.ong/ Luke Ong], who placed special emphasis on compositionality, i.e. the definition of strategies inductively on the syntax. Using game semantics, the authors mentioned above have solved the long-standing problem of defining a [[fully abstract]] model for the programming language [[Programming language for Computable Functions|PCF]]. Consequently, game semantics has led to fully abstract semantic models for a variety of programming languages and, to new semantic-directed methods of software verification by software [[model checking]].

Shahid Rahman and Helge Rückert extended the dialogical approach to the study of several non-classical logics such as modal logic, relevance logic, free logic and connexive logic. Recently, Rahman and collaborators developed the dialogical approach into a general framework aimed at the discussion of logical pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;http://stl.recherche.univ-lille3.fr/sitespersonnels/rahman/accueilrahman.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quantifiers ==
Foundational considerations of game semantics have been more emphasised by [[Jaakko Hintikka]] and Gabriel Sandu, especially for [[independence-friendly logic]] (IF logic, more recently ''information''-friendly logic), a logic with [[branching quantifier]]s. It was thought that the [[principle of compositionality]] fails for these logics, so that a Tarskian [[truth definition]] could not provide a suitable semantics. To get around this problem, the quantifiers were given a game-theoretic meaning. Specifically, the approach is the same as in classical propositional logic, except that the players do not always have [[perfect information]] about previous moves by the other player. [[Wilfrid Hodges]] has proposed a [[compositional semantics]] and proved it equivalent to game semantics for IF-logics.

== Computability logic == 
[[Giorgi Japaridze|Japaridze]]’s [[computability logic]] is a game-semantical approach to logic in an extreme sense, treating games as targets to be serviced by logic rather than as technical or foundational means for studying or justifying logic. Its starting philosophical point is that logic is meant to be a universal, general-utility intellectual tool for ‘navigating the real world’ and, as such, it should be construed semantically rather than syntactically, because it is semantics that serves as a bridge between real world and otherwise meaningless formal systems (syntax). Syntax is thus secondary, interesting only as much as it services the underlying semantics. From this standpoint, Japaridze has repeatedly criticized the often followed practice of adjusting semantics to some already existing target syntactic constructions, with [[Paul Lorenzen|Lorenzen]]’s approach to intuitionistic logic being an example. This line of thought then proceeds to argue that the semantics, in turn, should be a game semantics, because games “offer the most comprehensive, coherent, natural, adequate and convenient mathematical models for the very essence of all ‘navigational’ activities of agents: their interactions with the surrounding world”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giorgi Japaridze|G. Japaridze]], “[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-9374-6_11 In the beginning was game semantics]”. In: [https://www.springer.com/book/9781402093739 Games: Unifying Logic, Language and Philosophy]. O. Majer, A.-V. Pietarinen and T. Tulenheimo, eds. Springer  2009, pp.249-350.  [https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0507045|Preprint]&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the logic-building paradigm adopted by computability logic is to identify the most natural and basic operations on games, treat those operators as logical operations, and then look for sound and complete axiomatizations of the sets of game-semantically valid formulas. On this path a host of familiar or unfamiliar logical operators have emerged in the open-ended language of computability logic, with several sorts of negations, conjunctions, disjunctions, implications, quantifiers and modalities. 

Games are played between two agents: a machine and its environment, where the machine is required to follow only effective strategies. This way, games are seen as interactive computational problems, and the machine’s winning strategies for them as solutions to those problems.  It has been established that computability logic is robust with respect to reasonable variations in the complexity of allowed strategies, which can be brought down as low as logarithmic space and polynomial time (one does not imply the other in interactive computations) without affecting the logic. All this explains the name “computability logic” and determines applicability in various areas of computer science.  [[Classical logic]], [[independence-friendly logic]] and certain extensions of [[Linear logic|linear]] and [[Intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]] logics turn out to be special fragments of computability logic, obtained merely by disallowing certain groups of operators or atoms.

However, many English sources also call it the "German Fairy Tale Road".&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-de|Deutsche Märchenstraße}}) is a [[tourist]] attraction in [[Germany]] originally established in 1975. With a length of {{convert|600|km|mi}},&lt;ref&gt;''German Fairy Tale Route'' brochure, Deutsche Märchenstraße e.V., Kassel, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the route runs from [[Hanau]] in central Germany to [[Bremen]] in the north. Tourist attractions along the route are focused around the brothers [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm]] and [[Jacob Grimm]], including locations where they lived and worked at various stages in their life, as well as regions which are linked to the [[fairy tale]]s found in the [[Grimm's Fairy Tales|Grimm collection]], such as [[The Town Musicians of Bremen]]. The ''Verein Deutsche Märchenstraße'' society, headquartered in the city of Kassel, is responsible for the route, which travellers can recognize with the help of road signs depicting the heart-shaped head of a pretty, fairylike creature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deutsche-maerchenstrasse.com/de/presse/index.html Presseinfos des Vereins: „10.04.2010 - Presse-Basis-Info“ (PDF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615073658/http://deutsche-maerchenstrasse.com/de/presse/index.html |date=2011-06-15 }} (checked on July 8, 2010, in German only)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourist attractions==
The German Fairy Tale Route passes through various scenic regions, which include eight nature parks including the [[Hesse|Hessian]] [[Spessart Nature Park]], [[Hoher Vogelsberg]] Nature Park, Kellerwald-Edersee Nature Park, Meißner-[[Kaufungen Forest]] Nature Park, [[Habichtswald]] Nature Park and the [[Weser Uplands-Schaumburg-Hamelin Nature Park|Weser Uplands Nature Park]].
The towns and cities associated with the [[Brothers Grimm]] and located along the route are Hanau, Steinau, Marburg and Kassel. The original ''Children’s and Household Tales'' (German: ''Kinder- und Hausmärchen''), edited and published by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in 1812 and known today as ''Grimm’s Fairy Tales'' (German: ''Grimms Märchen''), can be found in Kassel. In 2005, this collection was added to the [[UNESCO World Document Heritage List]]. Several places along the Fairy Tale Route are connected with the fairy tales themselves. In the town of [[Alsfeld]], visitors can see what is known as the House of [[Little Red Riding Hood]] (''Rotkäppchenhaus''); the spa Bad Wildungen offers a [[Snow White]] Museum (''Schneewittchen Museum''); and Dorothea Viehmann, from whom the Grimms learned about many of the fairy tales found in their collection, was born in what today is the community of Baunatal. According to legend, the hill Hoher Meissner is where Mother Hulda is said to have resided; Sababurg Castle, located in Reinhardswald Park, is referred to as the [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]]. Further attractions include the town of Hamelin, of [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]] fame; the spa of Bad Oeynhausen, which has a museum devoted to fairy tales and local legends (''Deutsches Märchen- und Wesersagenmuseum''); and the city of Bremen, which is famous for the tale of the [[Town Musicians of Bremen]].

Numerous picturesque medieval towns can be found among the Route's attractions as well. In 1975, the Council of Europe awarded [[Alsfeld]] the status of a model European community for the conservation of historic buildings. The old centre of the town of Hann. Münden comprises roughly 700 half-timbered houses; the 1300-year-old town of Fritzlar is famous for its imperial cathedral; and [[Hamelin]] contains beautiful examples of [[Weser Renaissance]] architecture.

The baroque grounds of [[Philippsruhe Castle]] in [[Hanau, Germany|Hanau]], the fountain displays in the Hillside Park of [[Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe]], as well as the [[Bremen Town Hall]] with the adjacent statue of Roland (both of which are on the UNESCO World Heritage List) are also of particular interest. The 200th anniversary of the first publication of '''''Children's and Household Tales''''' by the Brothers Grimm was observed in 2012-2013 with a series of events. Many other events, open-air festivals, exhibits, and performances dealing with the topic of fairy tales are held annually.

{{Nihongo|'''''Guilty Crown'''''|ギルティクラウン|Giruti Kuraun}} is a 2011 Japanese [[anime]] television series produced by [[Production I.G]] which aired on [[Fuji TV]]'s [[noitamina]] program block from October 13, 2011.&lt;ref name="crunchyroll-pv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2011/09/08-1/new-guilty-crown-promotion-video-streamed-theme-songs-announced|title=New "Guilty Crown" Promotion Video Streamed, Theme Songs Announced|publisher=Crunchyroll|date=September 8, 2011|accessdate=September 21, 2011|first=Greg|last=Lanson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story revolves around Shu Ouma, a high school boy who inadvertently obtains an ability called "Power of the King" that enables him to draw out items called "Voids" from other people. He is then thrown into the conflict between a [[Government-owned corporation|quasi-governmental organization]] known as the GHQ and a resistance organization called ''Funeral Parlor'' which aims to restore Japan's independence from the GHQ. In the process, Shu has to deal with the burden his ability puts on his shoulders and the horrific mystery of his past.  The series incorporates elements of numerous genres, mostly drawing from [[science fantasy]].

Two [[manga]] adaptations were published by [[ASCII Media Works]] and [[Square Enix]]. A [[light novel]] was published by [[Nitroplus]] titled ''Guilty Crown: Princess of Deadpool'' in April 2012. A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[visual novel]] named ''Guilty Crown: Lost Christmas'' was also developed by Nitroplus which came bundled with a 15-minute [[original video animation]] (OVA) named ''Guilty Crown: Lost Christmas''.

==Synopsis==
{{see also|List of Guilty Crown characters}}

===Setting===
Before the events of the main story, on December 24, 2029, a biological hazard known as the Apocalypse Virus brought on by an [[impact event]] plunges Japan into a state of chaos. This event is later named the Lost Christmas incident. Unable to contain the threat, Japan sought international help and the [[United Nations]] dispatches an organization known as the GHQ to their aid. The GHQ successfully contains the outbreak and restores a level of normalcy at the cost of Japan's independence. Ten years later, a resistance organization known as the Funeral Parlor wages a campaign against the GHQ to liberate Japan once more.

===Plot===
High school student Shu Ouma encounters a wounded girl named Inori Yuzuriha, the vocalist of a popular internet group Egoist, taking refuge at his film club's workshop. The GHQ Anti Bodies storm the workshop and arrest her for involvement with Funeral Parlor. Shu follows the coordinates of Inori's robot to a drop zone where he meets Funeral Parlor's leader, Gai Tsutsugami, who asks him to safeguard a vial. As GHQ begins attacking the Ruppongi area looking for the vial, it shatters as Shu goes to rescue Inori when she becomes threatened by GHQ Endlave mechs. The vial contains the Void Genome, a powerful genetic weapon derived from the Apocalypse Virus that grants Shu the "Power of the King", an ability that allows his right hand to extract Voids, weapons of people's psyche given physical form. Shu then extracts Inori's Void and destroys the attacking Endlaves.

Eventually, Shu falls in love with Inori and reluctantly joins Funeral Parlor. During one operation, Inori is taken by a boy named Yuu, who possesses the second Void Genome. Shu's repressed memories return to him, revealing his sister Mana had been the first to be infected with the Apocalypse Virus years earlier and caused a massive explosion which spread the Apocalypse Virus across Japan: the Lost Christmas. Inori was created to hold Mana's soul to create a new race of humans after the Apocalypse Virus annihilates the current human population. Gai and Shu work together and Shu stabs Mana's stasis pod, knowingly killing Gai in the process.

Two weeks later, the GHQ seals off the area surrounding Roppongi in Tokyo, now called Loop 7, leaving a large number of teenagers to take refuge at Tennouzu High School along with Funeral Parlor members Shu, Inori, Ayase and Tsugumi. With food and Apocalypse Vaccine supplies running low, Shu is elected the new student council president and eventually becomes a tyrant, after Hare's death. Shu and the others eventually break out of Loop 7, though in the process a resurrected Gai appears and severs Shu's right arm, transferring the Void Genome to him.

Gai protects Japan from being destroyed by the United Nations in an attempt to stop of the Apocalypse Virus. The mastermind behind the events in Japan is an ancient organization known as "Daath" whose purpose was to obtain Shu's power and Inori. Inori later lets herself get captured by Daath in order to protect Shu. Haruka Ouma, Shu's stepmother, betrays the GHQ and steals the third Void Genome which Shu later injects himself with. As events progress, Gai intends to cause the Lost Christmas event on a global scale. Funeral Parlor surrounds GHQ Headquarters at [[Tokyo Bay]] and attack. The Apocalypse Virus begins spreading across the planet from the GHQ Tower.

Shu defeats Gai who explains that the only way to stop the Fourth Apocalypse was to let Mana fulfill her destiny of starting it, after which she would finally be able to rest in peace, which is why he aided Daath. Gai then dies with Mana as the Virus envelops them both. Shu embraces Inori and activates his Void, absorbing everyone's Voids and taking all of the Apocalypse Virus onto himself. As he is about to be consumed, Inori sacrifices her own life to the virus, saving Shu. With the virus finally eradicated, the GHQ Tower collapses and everyone escapes. Some years later, Ayase, Tsugumi, Yahiro, Kanon, Souta and a now blind Shu celebrate Hare's birthday in a rebuilt Tokyo.

==Production==
In the making of the series, the staff wanted to make "the next generation of anime with this show." For this they wanted it to be an original anime rather than an adaptation. The staff also wanted it to be a "two-season show" regardless of possible difficulties. The basic concept of the show is in a "Japanese style, a Japanese concept, and that is what makes it more original than other shows." When asked about similarities between Shu and ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''{{'}}s lead [[Shinji Ikari]], the staff answered they are both passive characters although they found Shinji more passive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2011-11-28/interview-koji-yamamoto-ryo-ohyama-and-george-wada-on-guilty-crown|title=Interview: Koji Yamamoto, Ryo Ohyama, and George Wada on Guilty Crown|publisher=Anime News Network|date=November 28, 2011|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked what circumstances led to his involvement, Redjuice responded that the production staff's illustrators and animators felt that his concept art exhibited a sense of compatibility with the final product.&lt;ref name="livedoor-redjuice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/5884411/|title=10月期ノイタミナ『ギルティクラウン』公開直前！　キャラクター原案・redjuice氏も衝撃の「"鬼"すぎる」制作現場|publisher=Livedoor|date=September 23, 2011|accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ryo of [[Supercell (band)|Supercell]] was providing the insert songs for the show, Redjuice himself was not participating in the project as a member of Supercell.&lt;ref name="livedoor-redjuice"/&gt; Besides liking Inori, the main heroine of ''Guilty Crown'', Redjuice stated that he had done many drawings of Tsugumi.&lt;ref name="livedoor-redjuice"/&gt; The staff had no qualms with the cat-like ears of Tsugumi so Redjuice feels that he has slipped his personal tastes into the series.&lt;ref name="livedoor-redjuice"/&gt; Redjuice also likes Kanon although she was not originally written into the scenario.&lt;ref name="livedoor-redjuice"/&gt; As Redjuice has not worked with 3D CG much, he was able to learn a lot from the staff at Production I.G.&lt;ref name="livedoor-redjuice"/&gt;

The full version of the game includes a short 10-minute anime.

==Reception==
The series received mixed critical reaction. Carl Kimlinger from [[Anime News Network]] commended the series' bravery on reinventing its plot but described the plot as jumbled and continued the trend of weak characters and clichés.&lt;ref name="ANN review2"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/guilty-crown/episodes-13| title=ANN reviews episodes 13–22| first=Carl| last=Kimlinger| date=May 12, 2012| publisher=[[Anime News Network]]| accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aiden Foote of THEM Anime Reviews agreed with Kimlinger on the presentation and plot and added that the characters are unsympathetic with back stories that do not add depth to them. On the other hand, Foote remarks the aesthetics and the musical appeal, stating that "Guilty Crown is its own jewel in terms of music, visual flare and design from the characters to the setting, to the set pieces."&lt;ref name="THEM anime"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=1422| title=THEM Anime Review| publisher=THEM Anime Reviews 4.0|last=Foote|first=Aiden| accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Beveridge from The Fandom Post commented "While it goes big and throws a lot at us, the end result that defines the rest of the season is one that works fantastically well for me because it introduces radical change into the series." He praised Shu's character development as well as the setting chosen for its second half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fandompost.com/2013/08/21/guilty-crown-complete-series-part-2-blu-raydvd-anime-review/| title= Guilty Crown: Complete Series Part 2 Blu-ray/DVD Anime Review | publisher=Fandom Post| accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DVD Talk]]'s Kyle Mills gave the series more praise, noting that despite small criticism "the 1st 11 episodes of the series are great." He praised the story and setting but criticized the development of certain characters comparing them to "flaws" ''[[Gurren Lagann]]'' made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/61994/guilty-crown-complete-series-part-1/?___rd=1| title= Guilty Crown: Complete Series Part 1 (Blu-ray) | publisher=DVDTalk| accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK Anime Network commented on the series' second half that the series "bites off more than it can chew, and at times the fervent mastication that comes from this leaves certain aspects of its narrative as something of a sloppy mess, but there's still an interesting story being told here and much of it is delivered in an enjoyable fashion thanks to a superb soundtrack, slick action set pieces, and some strong ideas that make good use of the show's cast of characters." Despite criticism, Andy Hanley of UK Anime Network praised the animation as  "visually eye-catching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uk-anime.net/anime/Guilty_Crown_-_Part_2.html| title= ANIME REVIEW: Guilty Crown - Part 2| publisher=UK Anime Network| accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Guoji Zibai ''pan''''' ({{zh|s=虢季子白盘|t=虢季子白盤|p=Guójì Zǐbaí Pán}}) is an ancient Chinese [[bronze]] rectangular ''pan'' vessel from the [[Western Zhou dynasty]] (1046 BC&amp;ndash;771 BC). Excavated in [[Chencang District]] of [[Baoji]], [[Shaanxi]] during the [[Daoguang Emperor|Daoguang era]] (1821&amp;ndash;1851) of the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644&amp;ndash;1911), it is on display in the [[National Museum of China]] in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name="lychee"&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.chnmuseum.cn/Default.aspx?TabId=212&amp;AntiqueLanguageID=1029&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |script-title=zh:“虢季子白”青铜盘|trans-title=Bronze plate the Ji Zibai Plate of the Guo State |newspaper=National Museum of China |year=2017 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guoji Zibai ''pan'' is the largest known bronze plate in the world. It enjoys the reputation of the best bronzeware in the Western Zhou dynasty (1046 BC&amp;ndash;771 BC). The Guoji Zibai ''pan'', the San Family Plate ({{zh|t=散氏盤|labels=no}}), and the [[Mao Gong Ding|Mao Gong ''ding'']], are known as the "Three Important Bronzewares in the Western Zhou dynasty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.cnarts.net/CWEB/Appreciation_collection/index_read.asp?typeid=14&amp;page=1&amp;id=36196 |script-title=zh:青铜器欣赏：西周三大重宝之一虢季子白盘|trans-title= Appreciation of Bronze Ware, the Ji Zibai Plate of the Guo State, one of the Three Important Treasures in the Western Zhou dynasty |newspaper=cnarts.net |date=2018-03-04 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.sohu.com/a/213985471_826848 |script-title=zh:西周三大青铜器国宝之一的虢季子白盘传奇|trans-title=Legend of the Ji Zibai Plate of the Guo State, one of the Three Important Bronze Wares in the Western Zhou dynasty|newspaper=sohu |date=2018-01-01 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The rectangular Guoji Zibai ''pan'' resembles a [[bathtub]]. It is {{convert|39.5|cm|adj=on}} high, {{convert|137.2|cm|adj=on}} long, and {{convert|86.5|cm|adj=on}} wide. It weighs {{convert|215.3|kg}}.&lt;ref name="lychee"/&gt; The four corners are regular fillets and the four feet are all in rectangular shape, and hidden at the bottom of the plate making the mouth of the plate appear large while the bottom small. On each wall outside of the plate, there are two beast heads with rings in the mouths, and decorative patterns in the shape of ware band.

==Inscription==
According to the inscription, the Guoji Zibai ''pan'' was cast by Guoji Zibai ({{zh|c=虢季子白|labels=no}}), a nobleman in the [[Western Guo]] State (1046 BC&amp;ndash;687 BC) in the [[Western Zhou dynasty]] (1046 BC&amp;ndash;771 BC). The plate was cast in 816 BC, the 12th year of [[King Xuan of Zhou]]. Guoji was a major branch of the Guo lineage that ruled the Western Guo, and Zibai was his [[courtesy name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://news.163.com/16/0429/11/BLQKL6MU00014AEE.html |script-title=zh:虢季子白盘铭文艺术赏析|trans-title=Art Appreciation of the Inscription on the Ji Zibai Plate of the Guo State |newspaper=163.com |date=2016-04-29 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the inscription on the plate, in the 12 year of King Xuan of Zhou, also the year of 816 BC, Guoji Zibai was appointed by King Xuan to lead the army to battle with the nomadic tribe [[Xianyun]] in the north shore of [[Luo River (Shaanxi)|Luo River]], and gained a complete victory. Guoji Zibai cut the enemy's ears off and offered it to the King Xuan, King Xuan held a grand ceremony to honor his achievement and bestowed him a lot of horses and weapons to praise him. Guoji Zibai specially cast the bronze ware to memorize the military operation and honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/2004-01-28/0541286380.html |script-title=zh:虢季子白盘背后的故事（博物一览） |newspaper=sina |date=2004-01-28|trans-title=The story behind the Guoji Zibai ''pan''|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plate was cast in 816 BC, and the writing technique of the inscription on the plate was very similar to those of the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'', which was the earliest collection of poetry in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://gold.hexun.com/2009-02-21/114782611.html |script-title=zh:虢季子白盘铭文韵律天成早《诗经》数百年 |newspaper=hexun |date=2009-02-21 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
In ancient China, water held in small plates was used for washing hands and faces, and in large plates it was used for baths. The rings on the outside walls of the plate were probably designed for carrying the plate to pour water conveniently. the Guoji Zibai ''pan'' was large, heavy and inconvenient to use in daily life. It seemed that it was more suitable to hold things in a large volume, just like ''Jian'' ({{zh|s=鉴|t=鑒|p=|labels=no}}), which was used to hold ice cube in ancient China. According to the set of [[etiquette]] at that time, when a high-ranking official died, his body should stay in the mortuary for seven days. In summer, ice was a must to prevent the body from decaying. Therefore, maybe the plate was a container used for holding ice cubes. But there has been no authoritative final conclusion about the exact usage of the plate in the academic circle.

==Discovery==
===Qing dynasty===
[[File:劉銘傳肖像.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Liu Mingchuan]] (1836&amp;ndash;1896), the third owner of the Guoji Zibai ''pan'' who protected it between 1864 and 1896]]
[[File:Weng Tonghe2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Weng Tonghe]] (1830&amp;ndash;1904), scholar and Minister of Revenue, who coveted the Guoji Zibai ''pan'']]

According to ''Prefecture Records of Luzhou'' ({{zh|s=《庐州府志》|p=|labels=no}}), the Guoji Zibai ''pan'' was unearthed at Guochuansi of [[Baoji]], [[Shaanxi]], in the Daoguang period (1821&amp;ndash;1851) of the Qing dynasty (1644&amp;ndash;1911). Xu Xiejun ({{zh|s=徐燮钧|p=|labels=no}}), the then magistrate of Mei County, purchased the plate for {{convert|5000|g|adj=on}} silver from a local  peasant. And he brought the plate to his house "Tianyou Hall" ({{zh|s=天佑堂|p=|labels=no}}). In April 1860, it fell into the hands of [[Chen Kunshu]] and became the treasure of the Mansion of Prince Protector.&lt;ref name="watermelon"&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://news.eastday.com/csj/2012-08-25/21396.html|trans-title=The Liu Mingchuan family vowed to guard the Guoji Zibai ''pan''|script-title=zh:刘铭传家族誓死守护虢季子白盘 |newspaper=Eastday |date=2012-08-25 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1864, namely the 3rd year of [[Tongzhi Emperor|Tongzhi period]] of Qing dynasty, [[Liu Mingchuan]] (1836&amp;ndash;1896), general of the [[Huai Army]], led the troops of Qing Empire to fight with the [[Taiping Army]], and finally liberated [[Changzhou]]. When Liu moved into the mansion, his soldiers didn't know the plate and used it as a [[manger]]. One night when reading a book under the [[oil lamp]], Liu heard clear metal clanks from out of the window. All was quiet at dead of night, so the clanks sounded clear and loud. Liu came to the stable following the sounds, and saw that a horse was eating grass with the bronze rings on the headstall hitting the manger from time to time to make the clanks. Liu was so curious that he bent to look carefully with the [[lantern]], and found the manger wide and deep with fuzzy decorative patterns on its four sides. Liu tired to push the manger but failed. It was very unusual and he decided to check it out after the dawn. The next day he ordered his attendants to carry out the manger and wash it. The bronze ware was very exquisite and Liu was very fond of it. He immediately sent his trusted followers to transport the manger to his hometown, [[Hefei]] in [[Anhui]]. Liu specially invited Huang Congmo ({{zh|s=黄从默|t=黃從默|p=|labels=no}}) who was familiar with ancient [[Chinese characters]] to help him research the bronze ware. Huang told him that most of bronze plates discovered in the past were round, and rectangular bronze ware was very rare, and such a large and rectangular plate was even more scarce and, or even might be the only one of its kind. And the inscription clearly showed that the bronze plate was casted by Guoji Zibai of the Western Guo State. After Liu understood the story of the manger he decided to protect it. Liu specially built an exquisite pavilion in his house, which he named "Plate Pavilion" ({{zh|s=盘亭|t=盤亭|p=|labels=no}}) to preserve the plate. Huang made a piece of [[rubbing]] from its inscription and copied a lot of copies. Huang sold it on the market. [[Weng Tonghe]] (1830&amp;ndash;1904), a collector and teacher of [[Guangxu Emperor]], wanted to buy the plate but Liu refused. Weng told the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] on Liu Mingchuan and complained about that. But Liu's superior [[Li Hongzhang]] explained that. Empress Dowager Cixi decreed to bestow the plate on Liu Mingchuan. In 1885 he was appointed the first provincial governor of [[Taiwan]] by the Qing government, a position he held for almost ten years until his retirement. From then on he lived a retiring life and didn't care about national affairs any more. The plate became his spiritual ballast in his declining years. In 1894, the [[Military of the Qing dynasty|Qing army]] were routed in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the Qing government was forced to sign the "[[Treaty of Shimonoseki]]". When hearing the news, Liu was furious that he became illness suddenly and died with indignation. Before he died, he told his children again and again that the plate was a national treasure and they should protect it even risking their lives.&lt;ref name="watermelon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pomegranate"&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://news.163.com/10/1119/10/6LRKSGON00014AED.html |script-title=zh:刘铭传后人献宝贺新中国诞生 |newspaper=163.com |date=2010-11-19 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="watermelon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kiwi fruit"&gt;{{cite news|author=Wang Qifeng|trans-title=Guoji Zibai ''pan'' was once a manger |url=http://news.ifeng.com/history/gundong/detail_2011_03/25/5354054_0.shtml |script-title=zh:虢季子白盘 昔日喂马槽 |newspaper=iFeng |date=2011-03-25 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic era===
In 1911, the [[Xinhai Revolution]] was broke out, China was torn by warlords. Some warlords began to covet all kinds of national treasures that they knew heard of. The Guoji Zibai ''pan'' in the Liu Family was no exception. In May 1933, the then governor of Anhui [[Liu Zhenhua]] came to Liu's home in the name of visiting the descendant of Liu Mingchuan. When meeting Liu Suzeng ({{zh|s=刘肃曾|t=劉肅曾|p=|labels=no}}), the fourth generation-son of Liu Mingchuan. Liu Zhenhua first flattered him with a beaming face, then he changed the topic, saying that he want to see the plate. Liu Suzeng said calmly that his ancestors did actually collect a plate, but they had never seen it. Liu Zhenhua suddenly turned hostile and commanded his soldiers to search the house. They searched everywhere but found nothing there. Liu Zhenhua sent [[spy|spies]] to watch every movement of the Liu Family in the hope of finding where the plate was. The Liu Family spent the next four year in fear and trembling.&lt;ref name="watermelon"/&gt;

In 1937, the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] was broke out, the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]] soon colonised the [[north China]]. After occupying Hefei, the Japanese army set a stronghold less than {{convert|3|km|adj=on}} away from the Liu Family. Soon after, they sent a message to the Liu Family that they would like to change a golden plate of the same size for the Guoji Zibai ''pan''. Liu Suzeng answered immediately that they didn't have any treasure and if they had, they didn't want to be unworthy descendant, or the bad apples of the country to sell it to foreigners. Liu Suzeng thought it over and over and finally hit upon a good idea, they dug a big hole in their yard, and buried the plate in the hole and planted a little [[Robinia|locust]] tree on it. In order to avoid the danger, the Liu Family moved to other places with same personal belongings at night to seek asylum. When the Japanese heard this, they made a wide and sweeping search of the Liu's house but found nothing. Finally, they set a fire on more than 30 buildings and than left.&lt;ref name="watermelon"/&gt;

After the [[surrender of Japan]], the Liu Family returned to home. [[Li Pinxian]] (1892&amp;ndash;1987), a KMT general and the then governor of Anhui, ordered Liu Suzeng to hand over the plate, but Liu refused. A few days later, Li Pinxian deliberately said that Liu had stolen the box full of gold bars, and forced Liu to write the iou. The Liu Family had to flee their home to seek asylum again. Li Pinxian came to Liu's house with his troops, they looked around the house and dug the yard to a depth of three feet but found nothing.&lt;ref name="kiwi fruit"/&gt;

===People's Republic era===
In October 1949, after the establishment of the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Communist State]], the [[Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Culture]] asked official from all over the country to rescue the treasures of cultural relics scattered from the folk. Wu Guichang ({{zh|s=吴桂长|t=吳桂長|p=|labels=no}}), chief of the CPC Feixi County Committee, heard the news that the Guoji Zibai ''pan'' is preserved in the Liu Family. Wu went to Liu's house many times and asked Liu Suzeng to donate the cultural relic to the country. Guo Chongyi ({{zh|s=郭崇毅|p=|labels=no}}), a local member of the [[Chinese Democratic League]], came to Liu's home with a document of the Central Government. After reading the document and talking with Guo Chongyi, Liu Suzeng decided to donate the treasure to the new country with a bronze [[drum]] of the Three Kingdoms period (220&amp;ndash;280) together. On February 28, 1950, the Liu Family officially donated the plate to the [[Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Culture]]. The government awarded Liu a certificate of praise and honor. Till then, the Guoji Zibai ''pan'' had accompanied the Liu Family for 86 years and been passed down by four generations. The Ministry of Culture gave the treasure to the National Museum of Chinese History. Later, the National Museum of Chinese History gave the relic to the [[National Museum of China]]. The Guoji Zibai ''pan'' has always been kept there since that time.&lt;ref name="watermelon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kiwi fruit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2005-03-20/12135411225s.shtml |script-title=zh:虢季子白盘国宝归国 |newspaper=sina |date=2005-03-20 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heidi M. Ravven''' (born 1952) is the Bates and Benjamin Professor of Classical and [[Religious Studies (journal)|Religious Studies]] at [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]], where she has taught her specialization, Jewish Philosophy, and general [[Jewish studies|Jewish Studies]] since 1983. She is a Fellow in Neurophilosophy of the Integrative Neurosciences Research Program, which is co-directed by Vilayanur Ramachandran and Kjell Fuxe. She has been appointed Visiting Professor of Philosophy in the School of Marxism at Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China, for 2017-20.

Professor Ravven holds a Ph.D. from [[Brandeis University]] (1984), attended [[Smith College]], and is a 1970 graduate of the [[Commonwealth School]], Boston.  Ravven was a founding member of the Society for Empirical Ethics, an organization devoted to promoting dialogue among [[philosopher]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[neurobiologist]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[psychologist]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[anthropologist]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and other social and natural scientists about [[ethics]].

== Career ==
Ravven is a neurophilosopher and specialist on the philosophy of the seventeenth century philosopher, [[Baruch Spinoza]].  She was the first to argue that Spinoza's moral philosophy is a systems theory of ethics.  Ravven was also the first philosopher to propose that Spinoza anticipated central discoveries in the neuroscience of the emotions. Ravven has published widely on Spinoza's philosophic thought, on the twelfth century philosopher [[Moses Maimonides]], on [[G.W.F. Hegel]] and [[feminism]], and on [[Jewish ethics]] and [[Jewish feminism]].

She has been active in the Academy for Jewish Philosophy, the [[International Neuroethics Society]], the North American Spinoza Society, and is a member of the [[American Philosophical Association]], the Association for Jewish Studies, the International Academy of Law and Mental Health, and the Society for Jewish Ethics.  Ravven is a past member of the Advisory Editorial Board of the ''Journal of Systemics, Cybernetics, and Informatics''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiisci.org/journal/sci/Past.asp Journal of Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics]&lt;/ref&gt; She is responsible for advising and editorial activities in two areas: in Neurophilosophy and also in Ethics.

In 2004 Ravven received an unsolicited $500,000 grant from the [[Ford Foundation]] to write a book rethinking ethics. That book, ''The Self Beyond Itself: An Alternative History of Ethics, the New Brain Sciences, and the Myth of Free Will'' was published by [[The New Press]] in May, 2013. It is an extended and multidisciplinary inquiry into moral agency: why we are moral, why and when we are not, and how to get people to be more moral. Ravven concludes with her own theory of moral agency inspired by the philosophy of Spinoza, which she updates to reflect contemporary understandings of how the brain/mind works in moral thinking and action. The book is accessibly written for a generally educated audience rather than just for specialists.

== Writings ==
In ''The Self Beyond Itself: An Alternative History of Ethics, the New Brain Sciences, and the Myth of Free Will,'' Ravven challenges the idea of [[free will]]. Attributing free will to human beings means that human beings have the capacity to rise above both nature and  nurture and even current situation to be good people and choose to act ethically. This capacity to choose our actions—to rise above our genetic inheritance whatever it might be, above our upbringing no matter how terrible it was, and above our present situation despite its social pressures—is what is meant by "free will."  We do moral acts for moral reasons, for no other fully determining reasons, and out of no other fully determining causes—such as brain modules, group pressures, or upbringing. And that is why we can be held morally responsible.  Ravven argues that this view is false and also that it is a cultural belief particular to the Western world. She traces the belief in free will to a theological myth and notion of human nature, and exposes the origins of the idea of free will in the Christian theology of the Latin West originating in the Church Father St. Augustine. She describes how that theology became secularized so that many today are unaware than free will presupposes a human person beyond nature and environment who can intervene as if from above (like an all-powerful God).  "The Self Beyond Itself" was translated into Chinese under the direction of Professor Han Quihong of Northeast Normal University in Changchun, China, and published by the People's Publishing House in 2016.

Ravven turns to search the new brain sciences to discover new ways that moral agency could be rethought without free will. She concludes that there are three factors that together determine action: nature (biology, etc.), nurture (biography, history, culture, language, etc.), and present situation (social  belonging and its demands, incentives, and disincentives, and the like).  So the most effective way of changing individual behavior is to intervene in social and cultural and familial systems at every scale. Promoting and bolstering diversity and whistle blowing within all these systems is vital to combating the tendencies to [[Groupthink]] that human nature makes us all too prone to. For we are social and contextual beings—our brains have evolved that way. Nevertheless, as Spinoza anticipated, an arduous path of the education of desire can lead to independence of mind from the tyranny of the immediate local world for those who undertake it.  We can learn to be good even if we cannot freely choose to be good.

Heidi Ravven has written extensively on the philosophy of Baruch Spinoza. Her articles appear in a number of journals and several have been republished in anthologies.  Ravven believes that Spinoza's philosophy is the best starting point for trying to integrate the evidence emerging from the new brain sciences into a viable model of the basic moral brain, the optimal route to its development, and the implications of such a view for how social, legal, political, and other institutions and practices might to be redesigned. Ravven is now engaged in writing a book accessible to a generally educated audience on the relevance of Spinoza, called ''The Return of Spinoza.''

'''[[Electroconvulsive therapy|Electroconvulsive Therapy]]''' (ECT) is a somewhat controversial therapy used to treat certain mental illnesses such as major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, depressed bipolar disorder, manic excitement, and catatonia&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kavanagh|first=Adam|last2=McLoughlin|first2=Declan|date=November 2009|title=Electroconvulsive Therapy and Nursing Care|url=http://proxy.rockford.edu:2048/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ccm&amp;AN=105270561&amp;site=eds-live|journal=British Journal of Nursing|volume=18|pages=1370-1377|via=CINAHL Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These disorders are difficult to live with and often very difficult to treat, leaving individuals suffering for long periods of time. In general, ECT is not looked at as a first line approach to treating a mental disorder, but rather a last resort treatment when medications such as antidepressants are not helpful in reducing the clinical manifestations. 

“Electroconvulsive therapy entails deliberately inducing a modified generalized seizure under medically-controlled conditions to obtain a therapeutic effect”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The therapeutic effect being reduced clinical manifestations of one’s mental disorder, therefore leading to less suffering. “ECT has been shown through various research trials to cause significant physiological and chemical changes at a molecular level of the brain; however, it is thought that the sustainability of ECT is threatened due to associated stigma and poor impression of the treatment itself”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saleem|first=Nida|last2=Rauf|first2=Shahzad|date=August 2018|title=Efficacy of Electroconvulsive Therapy in Treatment Resistant Depression|url=http://proxy.rockford.edu:2048/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ccm&amp;AN=105270561&amp;site=eds-live|journal=Pakistan Armed Forces Medical Journal|volume=68|pages=969-974|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In order to decrease the associated stigma and keep the treatment available to those who need it, the evidence on the efficacy needs to be publicized. 

== History and Controversy over ECT ==

=== Early Years  ===
Before the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;century, observations of the relationship between mental health and the physical body began to take place in the world of psychiatry. Between 1917 and 1934, there were developments in treating mental illnesses by physical means. Eventually by 1938, ECT was first used by neurologist Ugo Cerletti to treat schizophrenia. ECT’s popularity grew after it was observed that it was safer and more effective than previous somatic treatments, and it was noted that people with depression benefited more from ECT than those with schizophrenia&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cyrzyk|first=Thomas|date=April 2013|title=Electroconvulsive therapy: why it is still controversial|url=http://proxy.rockford.edu:2048/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ccm&amp;AN=104273989&amp;site=eds-live|journal=Mental Health Practice|volume=16|pages=22-27|via=CINAHL Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

=== Birth of Controversy  ===
Until the end of the 1960s, the way in which ECT was performed could be considered, for lack of a better term, shocking. “In these early days clients might be ‘shocked’ in open, communal wards of psychiatric asylums, tied to beds, without anaesthetic or muscle-relaxing agents, often several times a week. As an unfortunate consequence, many of the patients who underwent ECT felt abused, oppressed, punished and damaged, all of which had a negative impact on the treatment itself and psychiatry as a whole”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. 

“Aside from the therapy’s crude beginnings, controversy may have also been caused by a lack of information given when practitioners obtain informed consent before treatment, unknown mechanism of action, lack of knowledge about the cognitive adverse effects that can occur, divergent views of clinicians and consumers about ECT, and wide variations in official guidelines on minimal standards of ECT use”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.  

Essentially, the usage of ECT to treat mental disorder has been highly scrutinized by practitioners, and the general public as whole due to its controversial history in psychiatry, combined with its negative stigma in the modern world. This negative stigma in the modern world has created little importance in providing the adequate education for medical personal at all levels, including medical student and board-certified psychiatrists&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kellner|first=Charles|date=January 2011|title=Electroconvulsive Therapy The Second Most Controversial Medical Procedure|url=|journal=Psychiatric Times|volume=28|pages=41-47|via=CINAHL Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;. “It should be standard practice for all medical students to learn the basics of ECT and for all psychiatric residents to know enough about it to refer patients for whom ECT is an appropriate treatment consideration”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. The effectiveness of ECT is high compared to antidepressants and other antidepressant treatments such as vagus nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;; for this reason, clients, students, and medical professionals should be informed about the benefits and effectiveness that ECT can offer. 

“Some of the professional and popular ambivalence toward ECT is related to the fact that we still do not know exactly how it works”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. The lack of awareness on the effectiveness of ECT and the poor understanding of the exact functionality behind the treatment leads others to believe that ECT is unscientific. “The precise mechanism underlying the efficacy of ECT remains unclear, but one theory is that it promotes neuroplasticity by optimizing or “resetting” existing brain networks”&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srienc|first=Anja|last2=NARANG|first2=PUNEET|date=April 2018|title=Is Electroconvulsive Therapy a Treatment for Depression Following Traumatic Brain Injury|url=http://proxy.rockford.edu:2048/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ccm&amp;AN=129029688&amp;site=eds-live|journal=INNOVATIONS IN CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE|volume=15|pages=43-46|via=CINAHL Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;. ECT is thought to be morally wrong, just like other medical procedures that bring up controversy, such as abortion. However, “The best spokespeople for ECT are those patients and their family members who know from personal experience how debilitating depression can be and how effectively ECT can provide relief”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.

=== Lack of ECT Education ===

“Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for various psychiatric disorders since its introduction, it is one of the most controversial and scrutinized therapies in psychiatry”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sharma|first=Natasha|last2=Ghai|first2=Sandhya|date=2017|title=Knowledge and attitude of nursing students toward electroconvulsive therapy|url=http://proxy.rockford.edu:2048/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edsdoj&amp;AN=edsdoj.f4060c003344fae8893a88692b651b7&amp;site=eds-live|journal=Journal of Neurosciences in Rural Practice|volume=8|pages=7-12|via=Directory of Open Access Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Because it is highly controversial and scrutinized there is lack of importance given to educating students about ECT. “The negative connotations related to ECT tend to get reinforced from lack of knowledge and negative attitudes”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. With the lack of knowledge students cannot provide client’s all alternatives to their entitled care. Educating students is important because they can go through their career understanding the many alternatives and they can provide patients with a knowledgeable background to support it. “Nurses play an essential role in ECT, because of their close involvement with patients before and after the procedure. The knowledge and attitude of the nursing staff working ECT rooms can have direct impact on the quality of their nursing practice”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. In a study, published in the ''Journal of Neuroscience in Rural Practice'', there was a total of 183 nursing students that were surveyed on their knowledge about electroconvulsive therapy. “Only about half (53.6%) of the participants were aware that ECT cannot be given against the wishes of the patients”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. This result has a lot to do with the associated stigma, that patients receive ECT against their will, no treatment is given against the patients wishes. Changing this stigma can happen with knowledge that starts at school. “The present study shows that there are gaps in knowledge about ECT among nursing students… To fill such gaps there is a need to develop more pro-ECT curriculum”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.

== How the Procedure Works ==

=== Who is a candidate  ===
Electroconvulsive therapy is effectively used in major depressive patients to “increase the amount of nerve cells in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that is involved in mood regulation and memory. Antidepressants drugs have a similar effect but to a lesser extent than ECT”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

ECT is prescribed by a psychiatrist. Indications for ECT use were initially for schizophrenia, and those who poorly respond to medications. ECT can be used in the treatment for those with major depressive disorder, depressed bipolar disorder, manic bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, manic excitement, and catatonia&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piotrowski|first=Nancy|date=2013|title=Shock Therapy|url=|journal=Magill’s Medical Guide|volume=|pages=|via=Research Starters}}&lt;/ref&gt;. “Decision to conduct ECT therapy usually comes after there has been failure in other forms of treatment, including medication and psychotherapy”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. 

Prior to performing ECT, a set of tests are performed to ensure the patient fits the needs for ECT without further complication in their health status, that may prevent them from being eligible for treatment. Other medical screenings are performed to ensure that their depression is not caused by other medial illness, because that can have ECT be ineffective. “Before starting electroconvulsive therapy, all patients are screened for medical illnesses, for two reasons. First, a variety of medical illnesses are associated with depression or mania. The second reason for screening the patient is to establish that it is safe to proceed with ECT”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. Once the patient passed those two screening, the patient then is evaluated on their medical history, physical exam, psychiatric history, mental status exam, blood count, chemistries, urinalysis, and electrocardiogram&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. Contraindications and risk include: cerebral aneurysms, heart attack, emphysema, multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophy.

=== The Procedure ===
Before performing ECT, clients are instructed to take nothing by mouth for 8 hours before the procedure to prevent aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs that could increase the risk of pneumonia. The client also has a secured peripheral intravenous (IV) access, blood pressure cuff around one extremity, and is connected to an electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and pulse oximetry&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. The ECG and EEG are used to monitor electrical currents of the induced seizure. The nurse then ensures, “the patient is fully informed about their illness, why ECT has been recommended for them, the treatment process initially and throughout the course, allaying fears of the patient or their family may have about ECT and directing their attention to scientific fact and evidence supporting its use”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The client is then given a short-acting anesthetic, such as methohexital, and also given a muscle relaxant, such as succinylcholine&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;.  Once the determination of muscle paralysis is determined, a mild electrical current is administered to the patient’s brain. Paralysis is determined by observing the extremity that the blood pressure cuff is placed on. The blood pressure is inflated to stop the effects of the muscle relaxant to a specific part of the body, allowing muscle to contract from the electrical current that is administered to the patient’s brain. It is important to see the physical signs along with activity on EEG to determine the effectiveness of the procedure. “Small amounts of physical movement may be seen in the face, feet, or hands. These movements are not nearly as severe as those that occurred before the advent of muscle relaxants”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. 

After receiving ECT, “nurses will ensure the patient’s airway is maintained, monitor observations and administer prescribed medications to counter adverse effects…”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. After ensuring the patient is stable, the nurse would observe for normal side effects and document those side effects. “There is a period of confusion and disorientation that rapidly follows the treatment; it clears quickly. With each successive treatment, the patient is left with an ongoing loss of memory which will gradually clear after the course of therapy is finished”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. “Patients usually receive 6 to 12 treatments for full therapeutic benefit, but the number of ECT applications is titrated individually for each case”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. In many cases, the client receives ECT multiple times per week and a gradual decrease in treatments once the therapeutic effect is reached and noticed by client and physician.

== Contraindications and Side Effects of ECT ==

=== Contraindications ===
“There are no absolute reasons not to perform electroconvulsive therapy. There are certain conditions, however, that produce a significant increase risk with ECT”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. The list of contraindications for receiving ECT is relatively short. Once the decision to undergo ECT is made collaboratively between the patient and physician, the patient is screened for any contraindications. These include a history of cerebral aneurysms, heart attack, emphysema, multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophy&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

=== Side Effects  ===
The client can exhibit side effects such as nausea, headache, muscle stiffness, transient confusion, and temporary memory loss&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. “The most disturbing and severe side effect of ECT is memory loss. It is believed that this side effect is attributable to the electricity that is passed through the brain”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. “Most people return to reasonable function within the first month and to complete function after six months.” (Piotrowski and Guerra, 2013). These side effects are rare but commonly subside shortly after treatment. “For many people, the potential for adverse events outweigh the potential benefit of the treatment, even if the end result may be remission from depression”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

=== '''ECT compared to antidepressant medications''' ===
Antidepressants are considered a first line treatment for depression. While these medications are assessable to most, and effective enough to reduce clinical manifestations and increase quality of life for many suffering from depression, they are often not effective for severe depression and they come with a large array of side effects. There are multiple types of antidepressant medications: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), noradrenaline uptake inhibitors (NRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), as well as tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants, all of which have a different list of unpleasant side effects&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sharpley|first=Christopher|date=June 2011|title=Antidepressants in counseling psychology-Relevance, effectiveness and implications for practice|url=http://proxy.rockford.edu:2048/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=tfh&amp;AN=63295198&amp;site=eds-live|journal=Counselling Psychology Quarterly|volume=24|pages=139-156|via=Professional Development Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Side effects of MAOIs include tremors, insomnia, increased appetite leading to weight gain, blurred vision, urinary retention, headaches, acute hypertension and can even lead to intracranial hemorrhage when taken with food substances containing tyramine&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;. As one could imagine, these side effects are not easy to live with, especially on top of the already crippling aspects of living with mental illnesses such as depression. “Side effects of SSRIs and NRIs include nausea, anorexia, insomnia, loss of libido, and when combined with MOAIs, tremors, cardiovascular collapse and hyperthermia&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;.

Aside from the aforementioned side effects, perhaps the greatest side effect of pharmacological therapy is the efficacy in general-do they actually work? In some cases, “depression is considered “treatment-resistant,” meaning there is no clinical improvement in depressive symptoms after two trials of at least two antidepressants from two different classes and psychotherapy for 6-8 weeks; depression with psychotic features is considered “refractory” when it does not improve after one or two trials of antidepressant/antipsychotic combination”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.When medication is simply not effective, ECT has been shown, through various research trials, to cause significant physiological and chemical changes at molecular level of the brain which accounts for its therapeutic effect&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

== Efficacy of ECT in Treatment-Resistant Depression ==
As previously stated, ECT is not considered a first-line treatment for depression, but rather an intervention used when other interventions such as antidepressant medications do not help relieve one’s symptoms. According to ''Pakistan Armed Forces Medical Journal'', a descriptive case study conducted from April 2017 to October 2017 gathered a sample of 47 patients age 18-65 of either gender with treatment resistant depression with or without psychotic features&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Each patient was prescribed ECT for treatment resistant depression when there was no clinical improvement with two trials of anti- depressants from different pharmacological groups along with psychotherapy for at least 6-8 weeks or no clinical response to one or two courses of an antidepressant/antipsychotic combination in case of psychotic symptoms&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Participants in this study underwent 6 sessions (3 weeks) of ECT and were then assessed for clinical symptom improvement&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.  “The study concluded that efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy in patients with treatment-resistant depression was overall high with no major difference found in efficacy with respect to variables like age, gender, and psychosis”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

== Earning its Place in the Modern World ==
With the addition of multiple antidepressants and antipsychotics to treat mental disorders, ECT is not widely implemented in the U.S. today, despite the research that suggests it is an effective treatment for severe depression and other mental illnesses. The negative stigma surrounding ECT, thanks to its crude beginnings in psychology along with its perhaps not so accurate portrayal in movies and television, is still alive and well. However, because the methods used to perform ECT have drastically changed since it’s earlier days, individuals may be more open to trying ECT to relieve their symptoms of severe mental illnesses that have not responded to first line treatment. The fears surrounding the procedure are somewhat justified considering the history, but research and new implementation of ECT by trained physicians has proven that this is a safe and effective treatment that has the potential to help many individuals. Further education in medical and nursing schools will help to further promote the implementation of ECT and help those suffering in the vicious cycle of trying to relieve the symptoms of their mental illness.

'''Information policy''' is the set of all public laws, regulations and policies that encourage, discourage, or regulate the creation, use, storage, access, and communication and dissemination of [[information]].&lt;ref&gt;Weingarten, F.W. (1989) Federal Information Policy Development: The Congressional perspective. In C. McClure, P. Hernon and H. Relyea (eds), United States Government Information Policies: views and Perspectives (Ablex, Norwood, NJ).&lt;/ref&gt; It thus encompasses any other decision-making practice with society-wide constitutive efforts that involve the flow of information and how it is processed.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"&gt;Braman, S. (2011). Defining information policy. Journal of Information Policy 1-5. http://jip.vmhost.psu.edu/ojs/index.php/jip/article/view/19/14.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several fundamental issues that comprise information policy. Most prominent are [[public policy]] issues concerned with the use of information for democratization and commercialization of social life. These issues include, inter alia, digital environment, such as [[intellectual property]], economic regulations, freedom of expression, confidentiality or privacy of information, [[information security]], access management, and regulating how the dissemination of public information occurs.

== Overview ==

Information policy became a prominent field of study during the latter half of the 20th century as the shift from an industrial to an information society transpired.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt; It has since then evolved from being seen as relatively unimportant to having a much more overarching strategic significance since it establishes the conditions “under which all other decision making, public discourse, and political activity occur.”&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt; The growing awareness in the importance of information policy has sparked an interest in various groups to further study and analyze its magnitude. The most common audience for information policy analysis includes undergraduate and graduate students, scholars, policymakers, policy analysts, as well as those members of the public who have taken an interest in understanding the effects of the laws and regulations involving information.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

Although information policy generally has a broader definition and encapsulates a multitude of components, its scope and impact can vary depending on the context. For example, in the context of an information lifecycle, information policy refers to the laws and policies that deal with the stages information goes through beginning with its creation, through its collection, organization, dissemination, and finally to its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Marilyn Gell. (1983). The federal role in library and information services. White Plains, N.Y.: Knowledge Industry Publishers Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in the context of public administration, information policy is the means by which government employees, institutions, and information systems adapt themselves to an environment in rapid fluctuation and use information for decision-making (e.g., Andersen and Dawes, 1991; also see Bozeman and Bretschneider, 1986, and Stevens and McGowan, 1985). One can see how these two contexts offer varying scopes for the phrase “ information policy.”

Information policy is in fact, a combination of several varying disciplines including [[information sciences|information science]], [[economics]], law, and public policy.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt; Thus, its scope may differ when each of these disciplines analyses or uses it. The information sciences may be more concerned with technical advances and how this impacts information policy, while from a law perspective, issues such as privacy rights and intellectual property may be of greatest focus.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, M. W. (1995) Information Policies: premonitions and prospects. Journal of Information Science 21(4) 273-282.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==

The earliest sight of information policy was present around the mid-1900s.  The stages to begin evolving from an industrial society to an information society sparked several other transformations.  The common industrial technologies were beginning to be replaced by informational meta-technologies.  Organizations began changing their form, several new architectures of knowledge developed, and most importantly, the information economy replaced industrial and agricultural economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/braman/www/bramanpdfs/027_Braman_Chapt1.pdf |title=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee |publisher=Pantherfile.uwm.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, the concept of national information policy was created to protect the data and information that was used in creating public policies. The earliest adopters of information policy included the United States, Australia, as well as several European countries who all recognized the importance for a more standardized governance of information.

Elizabeth Orna contributed to a paper on information policies by providing a brief history of the development of ideas surrounding national and organizational information policies, from the beginning when the [[United Kingdom]] Ministry of Information was established in the [[World War I|First World War]] to present day. The history of information policy is reflected in this chart.

In the 20th century, to cope with the privacy problems of databases, information policy evolved further safeguards. In the USA, the federal [[Privacy Act of 1974|Privacy Act]] provides individuals the right to inspect and correct personal information in federal datafiles.

== Types and importance ==

The types of information policy can be separated into two different categories.  It can be discussed in the short-term focus exclusively on information science.  It can also have a much broader context in relation to different subjects and be within a larger time period, for example dating back to Roman civilization, the Bill of Rights, or the Constitution.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

The obvious reason for the need of information policy deals with the legal issues that can be associated with the advancement of technology.  More precisely, — the digitization of the cultural content made the cost of the copy decreasing to nearly zero and increased the illegal exchange of files, online, via sharing web site or [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P]] technologies, or off line (copy of hard disks).  As a result, there are many grey areas between what users can and cannot do, and this creates the need for some sort of regulation.  Today, this has led to the creation of SOPA ([[Stop Online Piracy Act]]).  Information policy will mark the boundaries needed to evaluate certain issues dealing with the creation, processing, exchange, access, and use of information.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

1. for avoiding risks (financial losses from incomplete and uncoordinated exploitation of information, wasted time, failures of innovation, and reputation loss);

2. for positive benefits, including negotiation and openness among those responsible for different aspects of information management
 
3. productive use of IT in supporting staff in their use of information

4. ability to initiate change to take advantage of changing environments

== Issues ==

There are some issues around organizational information policies,&lt;ref&gt;Orna Elizabeth, Information Policies, yesterday, today and tomorrow, Journal of Information Science, 34 (4) 2008, pp 547-565, apud N. Moore and J. Steel, Information-Intensive Britain. British Library R &amp; D report No. 6038 (The Policy Studies Institute/British Library Board, London, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; which are the interaction between human beings and technology for using information, the issue to proceed information policy itself, whether top-down or middle-up-down, is the best way to approach information policy in an organization. Also, issues that information tends to be influenced by organization’s culture that result in complexity of information flow. Moreover, the concern about valuing information is discussed by Orna, the fact that value of information is dependant on the user, and it can’t be measured by price. Considering that information is an asset or intellectual capital that becomes valuable when it is used in productive ways.

== Convergence==
Convergence essentially combines all forms of media, telecommunications, broadcasting, and computing by the use of a single technology: digital computers.&lt;ref name="MacInnes 2002"&gt;(Garcia-Murillo and MacInnes, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  It integrates diverse technological systems in the hopes of improving performance of similar tasks.  Convergence is thought to be the result of the need for expansion into new markets due to competition and technological advances that have created a threat of new entrants into various segments of the value chain.&lt;ref name="MacInnes 2002"/&gt; As a result, previously disparate technologies interact with one other synergistically to deliver information in new and unique ways and allow for inventive solutions to be developed.

Nearly every innovative trend in the social industry involves adding data or layers of connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;(Stanchak, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Social networking sites have begun interacting with e-mail functionalities, search engines have begun integrating Internet searches with Facebook data, Twitter along with various other social media platforms have started to play a prominent role in the emergency management framework (mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery) among several others.

In 2012 a prominent issue arose that deals with the convergence of social media with copyright infringement monitoring systems.&lt;ref name="Reisinger, 2012"&gt;(Reisinger, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  The growing interest in this topic can be largely attributed to the recent anti-piracy bills: the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] and the [[PROTECT IP Act]]. Various officials from all over the world have expressed an interest in forcing social networks to install and utilize monitoring systems to determine if users are illegally obtaining copyrighted material.&lt;ref name="Reisinger, 2012"/&gt; For example, if implemented, these filters could prevent the illegal sharing of music over social networking platforms. The convergence of search engines and social networks could make this process even easier. Search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing have begun to merge with social media platforms to link Internet searches to your social networking sites such as Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;(Houck, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; This poses an even greater threat to users since their Internet searches can be monitored via their social networks.

The issue of converging social networks with piracy monitoring systems becomes controversial when it comes to protecting personal data and abiding by [[privacy law]]s. In order for a synergy such as this one to take place, regulatory convergence would need to be considered. Regulatory convergence is the merging of previously disparate industry-based laws and regulations into a single legal and regulatory framework.&lt;ref name="MacInnes 2002"/&gt;

== Internet governance ==

Internet governance has both narrow and broad definitions, thus, making it a complex concept to understand. When most people think of Internet governance, they think of the regulations of the content and conduct that are communicated and acted on through the Internet.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, p. 50"&gt;Solum, 2008, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Although this is certainly a broad component of Internet governance, additionally, there are more narrow elements to the definition that are often overlooked. Internet governance also encompasses the regulation of Internet infrastructure and the processes, systems, and institutions that regulate the fundamental systems that determine the capabilities of the Internet.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, p. 50"/&gt;

Architecture is the foundation of the Internet. The fundamental goal of the Internet architecture is to essentially create a network of networks by interconnecting various computer network systems globally.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, 68"&gt;(Solum, 2008, 68)&lt;/ref&gt; Protocols such as TCP/IP as well as other network protocols serve as the rules and conventions by which computers can communicate with each other.&lt;ref&gt;(Solum, 2008, 67)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, TCP/IP is often viewed as the most important institution of Internet governance.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, 68"/&gt; It serves as the backbone to network connectivity.
 
Organizations such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ([[ICANN]]) coordinate the various systems within the Internet on a global level to help preserve the operational stability of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;(Solum, 2008, 48)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, coordination of IP addresses and managing the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) ensure computers and devices can correctly connect to the Internet and can communicate effectively globally. If regulation of these crucial elements of the Internet such as TCP/IP and DNS were governed by disparate principles, the Internet would no longer exist as it does today. Networks, computers, and peripherals would not be able to communicate and have the same accessibility if these foundational elements varied.

== Government roles ==

Like with any policy, there needs to be an agent to govern and regulate it. With information policy in a broader sense, the government has several roles and responsibilities. Some examples include providing accurate information, producing and maintaining information that meets the specific needs of the public, protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal and sensitive information, and making informed decisions on which information should be disseminated and how to distribute it effectively, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, M. (1997) The Field of Information Policy: 1. Fundamental Concepts, Journal of Information Science 23(4) 261-275&lt;/ref&gt; Although the government plays an active role in information policy, the analysis of information policy should not only include the formal decision making processes by government entities, but also the formal and informal decisions of both the private and public sector of governance.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

=== Security vs freedom of information ===

A persistent debate concerning the government role in information policy is the separation of security and freedom of information.  Legislation such as the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USAPATRIOT or USAPA) Act of 2001 is an example of security taking precedence over civil liberties.  The USAPA affected several surveillance and privacy laws to include:&lt;ref name=EPIC&gt;{{cite web|title=USA PATRIOT Act|url=http://epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot|accessdate=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Wire Tapping (Title III) which requires there be probable cause for real-time interception of voice and data communication.&lt;ref name="EPIC"/&gt;
* Electronic Communications Privacy Act(ECPA) regulates government access to email and other electronic communications.&lt;ref name="EPIC"/&gt;
* Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) authorizes the government to carry out electronic surveillance against any person, including Americans.&lt;ref name="EPIC"/&gt;
The USAPA was passed in October 2001, not long after 9/11 and without much contention from congress.  Civil liberties advocates argue that the changes made to the standing surveillance laws were done in an abrupt manner and without consideration to basic rights as outlined in the US constitution, specifically [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fourth amendment]] rights which protects against unreasonable search and seizure.

== Research methods and tools ==

The five broad methodological strands that Rowlands (1996) identified are current tools for information policy study:

Classification: The tool demonstrates a wide range of issues and subjects on information policy. It helps research to understand the breadth of the subject. The published materials are reasonably well documented and described. It is also good for start-up literature review and research purposes.

Identification of policy issues and options: This tool relies on inputs for information; for example, interviews and questionnaires targeting policy makers and other stakeholders. It is a commonly used in the studies of on-the-job policy makers in government or industry (Moore and Steele, 1991; McIntosh, 1990; Rowlands, 1997).

Reductionism: The reductionist approach control factors to reduce ambiguity. The factors include constraining data collection, analysis and interpretation within the framework of a specific discipline. It helps researchers to notice how a specific factor relates to the overall environment. 
Forecasting and scenario-building: The commonly used model is [[PEST analysis|STEEP framework]]. It helps in reducing uncertainties for a topic that is under studies.

Process-oriented research and cases studies: It provides detailed contextual analyses of particular events. It helps researcher to experience the policy process in semi-real situation and study its outcome.

== The future ==

In regards to the future of information policy, it should be flexible and changing to different circumstances as the ability to access, store, and share information grows.&lt;ref&gt;Galvin, T.J. (1994). Rights in Conflict: public policy in an information age. In: New Worlds in Information and Documentation : Proceedings of the 46th FID Conference and Congress&lt;/ref&gt;  Galvin suggests that information policy might include setting a boundary to the uncertainty in this field.  As information policy becomes a larger and more important topic, it will also become a greater subject to governmental regulation in regards to the future of technology as well.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;  It will also include the studies of these subjects: information science, communications, library science, and technology studies.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

The information policies will earn more advantages for national and organizational, such as getting the best from development of [[Web 2.0]] nationally and in organization, influence people for paying attention to the socio aspect and socio-technical system, for securing preservation of digital content, bringing out information product, also respecting all users and making thinking time respectable.

In order to achieve this national organization, it will be important to focus not only on a domestic level but also nationally. Making domestic agencies cooperate internationally (and vice versa) though, will not be overly successful. A single nation can take the lead in establishing communication-based relationships specifically regarding the internet. These relations will need to be slowly and consistently established in order to truly unify any kind of information policy and decision-making. If information policy can be established and guided on a semi-national level, the degree of communication and cooperation throughout the world will increase dramatically. As information policy continues to shape many aspects of society, these international relations will become vital (Harpham, 2011).

Information policy is playing a greater role in the economy leading to the production of goods and services, as well as selling them directly to consumers (UCLA, 2009).  The cost of information varies from a tangible good in that initial costs of the first unit are large and fixed; however, after that, marginal costs are relatively low (MacInnes, 2011).  As an increase from the information services, information can be paralleled to that of manufacturing several years ago (UCLA, 2009).  The digitalization of information allows businesses to make better justified business decisions (MacInnes, 2011).

The legal education in the Philippines was first introduced during the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish occupation]] when, in 1734, the [[University of Santo Tomas]] established the [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law|Faculty of Civil Law]].&lt;ref name="Mariano"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arellanolaw.edu/alpr/v4n1c.pdf |title=The State of Philippine Legal Education Revisited |last=Magsalin |first=Mariano Jr. |date=July 2003 |publisher=''[[Arellano University School of Law]]'' |type=PDF |access-date=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Malolos Constitution]] was ratified, the Universidad Literaria de Filipinas was established by Joaquin Gonzales in 1899; the said institution offered several courses including law. However, the Literaria's existence was short lived as a result of the eruption of the [[Philippine–American War|Filipino-American conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;dq=%2522Universidad+Literaria+de+Filipinas%2522+law+education&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=%2522Universidad%2520Literaria%2520de%2520Filipinas%2522%2520law%2520education |title=Philippine History |last=Halili |first=M. c |date=2004 |publisher=Rex Bookstore, Inc. |isbn=9789712339349 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American occupation]], specifically in 1911, the [[University of the Philippines College of Law]] was established, through the vision and efforts of [[George A. Malcolm|George Malcolm]]. The said law institution continues to be the one of the oldest state college of law in the country.&lt;ref name="Mariano"/&gt;

The ratification of the [[1935 Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution]] paved the way for the establishment of law programs in various private colleges and universities in Manila (schools, at that time, were required to acquire license to operate from the [[Department of Public Instruction]]). At that time, there was hardly any kind of supervision of law schools, especially for private institutions. The [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law|Faculty of Civil Law]] of the [[University of Santo Tomas]], the [[University of the Philippines College of Law|University of the Philippines–College of Law]], the former Colegio de Ateneo de Manila and the [[Philippine Law School]] were the leading law institutions during those period. After [[World War II]] and in the contemporary time, more law schools were then established.&lt;ref name="Mariano"/&gt;

===Legal Education Board===
The Legal Education Board supervises all law schools and continuing legal education providers in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1993/ra_7662_1993.html |title=REPUBLIC ACT NO. 7662: Legal Education Reform Act of 1993. |date=December 23, 1993 |website=Lawphil.net |access-date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board is headed by a Chairman who is a retired justice of a collegiate court (i.e., Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Sandiganbayan, Court of Tax Appeals, etc.). Regular members of the Board include a representative from each of the following:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

*[[Integrated Bar of the Philippines]] (IBP)
*Philippine Association of Law Schools (PALS)
*Philippine Association of Law Professors (PALP)
*active law practitioners
*bona fide law students

The Board has made legal reforms which include—the stricter selection of law students and law professors; improvements in quality of instruction and facilities of law schools; provisions for legal apprenticeship of law students; and the requirement of attendance to continuing legal education seminars for practicing attorneys.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

===Mandatory Continuing Legal Education===
Lawyers with names appearing in the ''Rolls of Attorneys of the Supreme Court'', unless disbarred, are all members of the [[Integrated Bar of the Philippines]] (IBP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2001/oct2001/bm_850.htm |title=B.M. 850. October 2, 2001:  MANDATORY CONTINUING LEGAL EDUCATION - A RESOLUTION ADOPTING THE REVISED RULES ON THE CONTINUING LEGAL EDUCATION FOR MEMBERS OF THE INTEGRATED BAR OF THE PHILIPPINES |date=August 22, 2000 |website=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] |access-date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, to be IBP members of good standing, lawyers are required to complete, every three years, at least thirty-six hours of continuing legal education seminars approved by the Mandatory Continuing Legal Education Committee (MCLE). Members who fail to comply shall pay a non-compliance fee, and shall be listed as a delinquent member.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chanrobleslawnet.com/index.php/resources/55 |title=ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER No. 113-2003 : ESTABLISHING THE MANDATORY CONTINUING LEGAL EDUCATION OFFICE |date=August 5, 2003 |website=Chan Robles Law Net |access-date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mandatory Continuing Legal Education Office, established by the Supreme Court, is the official government agency tasked to implement compliance with the MCLE requirement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The MCLE Office is headed by former Supreme Court Justice Carolina C. Grino-Aquino, widow of former Supreme Court Chief Justice Ramon Aquino. Its office is located at the fourth floor of the IBP Building in Ortigas Center.

== Legal systems==
The Philippine legal system is an amalgamation of the world's major systems. These systems include the [[Roman law|Roman]] [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] which was inherited from Spain;  the [[Law of the United States|Anglo-American]] [[common law]] which were derived from the laws of the United States; and [[Islamic law]] otherwise known as the [[Shariah law]] of the Muslim world, [[Private law]] and [[Philippine legal codes|legal codes]] are substantially patterned after the civil law of Spain, while the [[Public Law]], including the [[Political law]], is based on Anglo-American legal system.

==Law degree programs==
Law degree programs are considered professional/post-baccalaureate programs in the Philippines. As such, admission to law schools requires the completion of a [[bachelor's degree]], with a sufficient number of credits or units in certain subject areas. Completion of a required course from a Philippine law school constitutes the primary eligibility requirement in order to take the [[Philippine Bar Examination]], the national licensure examination as precursor to admission to the practice of law in the country.

Legal education in the Philippines normally proceeds along the following route:
* Undergraduate education (usually 4 years)
* Passing the Philippine Law School Admission Test or PhilSAT &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/admissions/graduate/_pdf/lebmo-11-s2016.pdf LEB Memorandum Order 7, series of 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Law school (usually 4 years)
* Admission to the bar (usually by taking a Philippine bar exam)
* Legal practice and mandatory continuing legal education

Law degrees in the Philippines may be classified into three types—professional, graduate level, and honorary.

===Professional law degrees===
In order to be eligible to take the bar examinations, one must complete one of the two [[First Professional degree|professional degrees]]: The [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.) program or the [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) program. Advanced degrees are offered by some law schools, but are not requirements for admission to the practice of law in the Philippines.

*'''[[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.)''' – The LL.B. is the most common law degree offered and conferred by Philippine law schools. It is a standard four-year law program covering all bar exam subjects. Almost all law schools follow a standard LL.B. curriculum, wherein students are exposed to the required bar subjects. Other schools, like the [[University of the Philippines College of Law]], allow students to substitute electives for bar review subjects  offered in the fourth year of study.&lt;ref name="Law Schools 2006"&gt;Curriculum models, ''Philippine Association of Law Schools'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.)''' - The J.D. degree was developed and first conferred in the Philippines by the [[Ateneo Law School]] in 1991. The J.D. program is a four-year law program. Like the standard LL.B. program, the J.D. curriculum covers the core subjects required for the bar examinations. Unlike the LL.B., the Ateneo J.D. program requires students to finish the core bar subjects in 2{{sfrac|1|2}} years, take elective subjects, undergo an apprenticeship, and prepare and defend a thesis.&lt;ref name="clv1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ateneolaw.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=93&amp;PHPSESSID=3de3cb420701c7a80495dc7f3ea2679c |title=Philippine Leadership Crisis and the J.D. Program |last=Villanueva |first=Cesar L. |date=September 27, 2007 |website=[[Ateneo Law School]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204011/http://ateneolaw.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=93&amp;PHPSESSID=3de3cb420701c7a80495dc7f3ea2679c |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the present, many of the law schools in the Philippines now offer the Juris Doctor program instead of the LL.B or the Bachelors of Law program.
**'''[[Juris Doctor]]&amp;ndash;[[Master of Business Administration]], (J.D.-M.B.A.)''', – The J.D.-M.B.A. program is a [[double degree]] program in law and management offered at the professional-graduate level. It was introduced and is so far offered only by the La Salle-FEU MBA-JD Program, a consortium of [[Far Eastern University Institute of Law]] and [[De La Salle Professional Schools|De La Salle Graduate School of Business]]. Under this program, the requirements of the J.D. and M.B.A. programs are satisfied by the taking of concurrent units of study, allowing students to complete the program in five instead of six years.&lt;ref name="Law Schools 2006"/&gt;

===Graduate law degrees===
Beyond the J.D. or LL.B., members of the Philippine bar have the option of pursuing graduate degrees in law.

*'''[[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.)''' – The LL.M. is a graduate law degree offered to holders of basic law degrees (LL.B. and J.D.). It is generally offered to law graduates and lawyers of any nationality. Six Philippine law schools so far conduct the program—the [[Ateneo Law School]], which offers an International Master of Laws program; the [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law]], which first offered the LL.M.; San Sebastian College - Recoletos Graduate School of Law; [[University of Manila]] College of Law; [[Manuel L. Quezon University]] College of Law; [[Central Philippine University College of Law]] in Consortium with [[San Beda College]]; [[San Beda College of Law|San Beda Graduate School of Law]]; and [[PLM Graduate School of Law]] of the ''Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila'' (University of the City of Manila). LL.M. programs were once offered by  the [[Far Eastern University Institute of Law]], the Escuela de Derecho de Manila (now Manila Law College Foundation), and the [[University of the Philippines College of Law]] but were eventually phased out due to lack of enrollment and funding.&lt;ref name="Law Schools 2006"/&gt;
*'''[[Doctor of Civil Law]] (D.C.L.)''' – The D.C.L. program is a doctoral program in law offered to holders of the LL.M. degree. Candidates who hold only LL.B. degrees may be admitted upon completion of prerequisite LL.M. subjects. The D.C.L. was pioneered by the [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law]]. Their program structure is highly similar to the D.C.L. offered in the [[Complutense University of Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;Official Prospectus, Law Department, ''University of Santo Tomas Graduate School'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[PLM Graduate School of Law]] has already opened its own D.C.L. program.&lt;ref&gt;List of programs, ''Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila'' (University of the City of Manila), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D. or J.S.D.)''' – The S.J.D. or J.S.D. program is currently offered only by the San Beda Graduate School of Law.  While the candidate for the degree is required some academic units, the grant of the degree relies on the candidates research output as well as his or her participation in international symposia, seminars and programs as lecturer, panel presenter or paper presenter. The candidate presents a doctoral dissertation that is argued before a Panel of Oral Examiners and then delivers a 'lectio coram' -- a lecture in the presence of legal luminaries.

===Honorary law degrees===
Some Philippine universities also confer the [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws]] (LL.D.) degree. It is given to famous individuals who, in the discretion of the awarding institution, were found to have made significant contributions to a certain field, or to the improvement of society or development of the conditions of mankind in general.

===Ecclesiastical law degrees===
A few [[Roman Catholic]] seminaries and graduate schools offer degree programs in [[canon law]], an ecclesiastical program that is not required in the [[Philippine Bar Examination]]s.The [[University of Santo Tomas Faculties of Ecclesiastical Studies|University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Canon Law]] runs the oldest academic programs of this kind. Its '''[[Licentiate of Canon Law]] (J.C.L.)''' and '''[[Doctor of Canon Law]] (J.C.D.)''' programs are open to priests, nuns, theologians, and even to lay people (i.e., trial court judges, law deans, family lawyers etc.). Judges of the Roman Catholic Marriage Tribunal typically hold academic degrees in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Official prospectus, ''University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Canon Law'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Degrees in canon law, strictly speaking, are not considered law degrees in the Philippines.

===Developments===
There is a move among members of the Philippine Association of Law Schools (PALS) to convert their LL.B. programs into J.D. curricula.&lt;ref name="clv1"/&gt; There are currently two possible directions for the change: First, the conversion of LL.B. programs through adopting a model substantially similar to the J.D. curriculum introduced by the Ateneo de Manila Law School (the J.D. Programs of the FEU-La Salle consortium and the University of Batangas Law School are of this mold), and second, simply changing the name of the degree conferred from "LL.B." to "J.D." while essentially retaining the same course offerings as those in the DECS Model Law Curriculum (DECS Order No. 27, series of 1989).&lt;ref name="clv1"/&gt;

==Admission to the practice of law==
The 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines]] has given the Supreme Court the sole power to admit individuals to the practice of law in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;Section 5, Article VIII, The Philippine Constitution, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; This power is exercised through a Bar Examination Committee, an ad hoc academic group tasked to formulate questions, administer proceedings, grade examinations, rank candidates, and release the results of the Philippine Bar Examination.

To be eligible to take the national bar exam, a candidate must be a Filipino citizen, at least twenty-one years of age, and holder of a bachelor's degree and a law degree obtained from a government recognized law school in the Philippines. Graduates of law schools from other countries must obtain a law degree from the Philippines to qualify for the Philippine Bar.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2, 5-6; Rule 138, Revised Rules of Court.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010 the Supreme court issued Bar matter 1153 allowing Filipino who are foreign law graduates to take the Bar exam provided that applicant complies with the following conditions: 
# completion of all courses leading to the degree of Bachelor of Laws or its equivalent degree; 
# recognition or accreditation of the law school by the proper authority; 
# completion of all fourth year subjects in the Bachelor of Laws academic program in a law school duly recognized by the Philippine Government; and
# must have completed a separate bachelor's degree."

===Bar examinations===
{{See also|Philippine Bar Examination}}
The [[Philippine Bar Examination]]s is the national licensure exam for admission to the practice of law. It is conducted during the four Sundays of September, or October, or November of every year. It is arguably the hardest and the most media-covered of all government licensure examinations in the country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Alexander L. Lacson. "A Nation Under Lawyers." ''The Practice: Business and Leisure Magazine for Lawyers''. August–September 2004 Issue.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also reputedly one of the hardest bar examinations in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Reports made by members of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, Session of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

For candidates intending to practice Islamic law in the Philippines, the ''Special Bar Exams for Shari'a Court Lawyers'' is given every two years. The Supreme Court Bar Office conducts the exam while the Office of Muslim Affairs determines the qualification and eligibility of candidates to the exams.&lt;ref&gt;Court En Banc Resolution, Supreme Court of the Philippines, September 20, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attorneys-at-law ===
To be a full-fledged lawyer in the Philippines and be eligible to use the title ''Attorney'', a candidate must graduate from a Philippine law school, take and pass the Philippine Bar Examinations, the candidate who passed the bar examinations is entitled to take and subscribe before the Supreme Court special en banc session the corresponding Attorney's Oath, as follows:

{{cquote|''I,_______________, do solemnly swear that I will maintain allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines, I will support the Constitution and obey the laws as well as the legal orders of the duly constituted authorities therein; I will do no falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any in court; I will not wittingly or willingly promote or sue any groundless, false or unlawful suit, or give aid nor consent to the same; I will delay no man for money or malice, and will conduct myself as a lawyer according to the best of my knowledge and discretion, with all good fidelity as well to the courts as to my clients; and I impose upon myself these voluntary obligations without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion. So help me God.''}}

The certificate to practice law will be granted by the Supreme Court after the lawyer sign his name in the ''Rolls of Attorneys of the Supreme Court''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Legal Profession'', a lecture delivered by Associate Justice Edgardo F. Sundiam of the [[Philippine Court of Appeals]], Ateneo School of Law, June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The full names of lawyers are found in the ''Rolls of Attorneys of the Supreme Court'', and in a similar list included in a Supreme Court publication entitled ''Law List.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/baradmission/lawlist/index.php |title=Law List |website=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] |access-date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philippine law schools==
Starting from 2017, the Legal Education Board had started implementing the Philippine Law School Admission Test &lt;small&gt;(PhilSAT)&lt;/small&gt;; the failure to pass such admission test prohibits a person from enrolling to any law schools in the Philippines. It is a one-day aptitude test intended to measure the academic potential of an examinee who wishes to pursue the study of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/03/17/philsat-entrance-exam-for-aspiring-law-students-starts-this-year |title=PhilSAT: Entrance exam for aspiring law students starts this year |date=February 3, 2017 |website=ABS-CBN News |access-date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2017}}, there are 108 law schools&lt;ref&gt;Milagros Santos-Ong, Office of the Director of Library Services, ''Supreme Court of the Philippines''. May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milagros Santos-Ong, ''Philippine Legal Research'', Central Professional Books, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; legitimately operating throughout the [[Philippines]]. These include independent law schools, resident colleges, and affiliated units of much larger private and public universities:&lt;ref&gt;Directory of Members, ''Philippine Association of Law Schools'', June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two anime series, LINE OFFLINE and LINE TOWN, were produced in 2013, picturing the Line Friends as employees for the fictional Line Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jpninfo.com/31855|title=Love LINE Friends?

=== Line Offline ===
Line Offline is an animated series created by [[Shogakukan Productions]], based on [[salaryman]] characters working at "Line Corporation". All 114 episodes last about three minutes. The series was aired from January 8, 2013, to October 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/07/line-offline/|title=Messaging App Line’s Kawaii Characters Get Their Own Cartoon Series In Japan – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episodes of Line Offline are not connected to each other. The idea behind the series is to represent the ordinary life of company employees (in this case Line's employees, hence the name "Line Offline"), in which every small problem could lead to awkward and hilarious situations that require some effort in order to restore the [[status quo]].

Most characters from Line Offline are part of Line's universe (the characters who are shown in the animated series are also Line Friends, and can be seen by users in Line Messaging App and used as emoticons).

==Education and career==
Mair obtained a first degree in history at [[London University]]. In 1974 she obtained a Ph.D. in history from the [[University of the West Indies]] with a dissertation entitled "A Historical Study of Women in Jamaica 1655–1844",&lt;ref name="Mona"/&gt; about which [[Verene Shepherd]] has said: "Over a period of three decades, it became the most sought-after unpublished work among students and scholars of Caribbean history and culture."&lt;ref&gt;Verene A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11201">The '''Maine accent''' is the local traditional pronunciation of [[Eastern New England English]] in parts of Maine, especially along the [[Down East|"Down East"]] and [[Mid Coast|"Mid Coast" seaside regions]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Walt; Ward, Ben (eds.) (2006). ''American Voices: How dialects differ from coast to coast''. Malden, MA ; Oxford: Blackwell Publishing. p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by a variety of features, particularly among older speakers, including ''r''-dropping ([[rhoticity in English|non-rhoticity]]), resistance to the [[horse–hoarse merger]],&lt;ref name="Labov"&gt;{{citation|last=Labov|first=William|authorlink=William Labov|last2=Ash|first2=Sharon|last3=Boberg|first3=Charles|year=2006|title=The Atlas of North American English|location=Berlin|publisher=Mouton-de Gruyter|isbn=3-11-016746-8|pages=226–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a deletion or "breaking" of certain syllables, and some unique vocabulary. This traditional Maine accent is rapidly declining; a 2013 study of [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] speakers found the horse–hoarse merger to be currently embraced by all ages and the [[cot–caught merger]] to be resisted,&lt;ref&gt;Ryland, Alison (2013). "A Phonetic Exploration of the English of Portland, Maine". Swarthmore College.&lt;/ref&gt; despite being typical among other Eastern New England speakers, even reported in the 1990s in Portland itself.&lt;ref name="Labov"/&gt; In the northern region of Maine along the Quebec border, Franco-Americans may show French-language influences in their English.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Walt; Ward, Ben (eds.) (2006). ''American Voices: How dialects differ from coast to coast''. Malden, MA ; Oxford: Blackwell Publishing. p. 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Maine English often features [[phonetic change]] or [[phonological change]] of certain characteristics. One such characteristic is that, like in all traditional Eastern New England English, Maine English pronounces the "r" sound only when it comes before a vowel, but not before a consonant or in any final position. For example, "car" may sound to listeners like "cah" and "Mainer" like "Mainah."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Fowles|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Also, as in much New England English, the final "-ing" ending in multi-syllable words sounds more like "-in," for example, in ''stopping'' {{IPA|[ˈstɑpɪn]}} and ''starting'' {{IPA|[ˈstäːʔɪn]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Fowles|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maine accent follows the pronunciation of [[Eastern New England English]], with the following additional features:
*{{IPAc-en|ɜr}} before a consonant is {{IPA|[ə~ɜ~ɛ]}}.
*Single-syllable words ending with [[R-colored vowel]]s (such as {{IPAc-en|ɪər|,_|ɛər|,_|ɔːr}}) sometimes become two syllables. The vowel loses its R-coloration. That includes {{IPAc-en|ɪər}} as in ''here'' {{IPA-all|ˈhɪ.(j)ɜ||"Here".ogg}}, {{IPAc-en|ɛər}} as in ''there'' {{IPA-all|ˈðeɪ.(j)ɜ||"There".ogg}}, and (as mentioned above) {{IPAc-en|oʊ|r}} as in ''more'' {{IPA-all|ˈmoʊ.(w)ɜ||"More".ogg}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Fowles|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**{{IPAc-en|ɔːr}} is {{IPA|[ɒə]}} in words like ''horse'' ({{IPA|[hɒəs]}} "hoss"), ''war'' ({{IPA|[wɒə]}} "waw"), ''north'' ({{IPA|[nɒəθ]}} "nawth"), or ''porch'' ({{IPA|[pʰɒətʃ]}} "pawch").
**{{IPAc-en|oʊ|r}} is {{IPA|[ˈoʊ(w)ə]}} in words like ''hoarse'' ({{IPA|[ˈhoʊ(w)əs]}} "hoe-us"), ''wore'' ({{IPA|[ˈwoʊ(w)ə]}} "whoa-uh"), ''more'' ({{IPA|[ˈmoʊ(w)ə]}} "mow-uh"), or ''shore'' ({{IPA|[ˈʃoʊ(w)ə]}} "show-uh").
*Many speakers also produce a dipping tone when they pronounce the extended word; they lower their tone for the first syllable and raise it for the second syllable.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The phrase "[[You can't get there from here]]," coined in an episode of the mid-1900s humor stories collection [[Bert &amp; I]], is a quintessential example of the principle of syllable extension.

==Lexicon==
The traditional Maine dialect has a fairly rich vocabulary. Some of this vocabulary is shared with other New England dialects, however much of it is specific to Maine. This vocabulary includes, but is not limited to, the following terms:
{{div col}}
*''apiece''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Fowles|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; an undetermined distance (as in "He lives down the road apiece")

*''beetah''&lt;ref name=bdn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://midcoastmillennial.bangordailynews.com/2015/06/01/home/the-outta-statahs-guide-to-maine-slang/ |title=The Outta Statah’s Guide to Maine Slang |last=Norman |first=Abby |website= |publisher=BDN |accessdate=16 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; a (beaten up) motor vehicle with value so diminished by extensive road salt corrosion there is little concern about additional collision damage from driving on icy roads

'''Mamallapuram''' or '''Seven Pagodas''' or '''Mahabalipuram''', is a town in [[Kancheepuram district]] in the southeastern [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref name=britmamalla/&gt; It is on the coastline {{convert|58|km}} south of the city of [[Chennai]]. An ancient historic town and a bustling seaport in the 1st millennium CE, now a beachside tourism center with a [[Group of Monuments at Mamallapuram|group of Tamil monuments]] declared as UNESCO world heritage site, it is one of the most visited towns in South India.&lt;ref name=britmamalla/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p399"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC&amp;pg=PA399|year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3179-8|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mamallapuram was one of two major port cities by the 7th century within the [[Pallava]] kingdom. Along with economic prosperity, it became a center of a group of battle monuments carved out of rock. These are dated to the 7th and 8th centuries: [[ratha]]s (temples in the form of chariots), [[mandapa]]s (cave sanctuaries), giant open-air [[rock relief]]s such as the famous ''[[Descent of the Ganges]]'', and the [[Shore Temple]] dedicated to [[Shiva]], [[Durga]], [[Vishnu]], [[Krishna]] and others.&lt;ref name=britmamalla/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p399"/&gt; The contemporary town plan was established by the [[British Raj]] in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Britannica'', 15th Edition (1982), Vol. VI, p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Neolithic 
burial urn, cairn circles and jars with burials dating to the very dawn of the [[Christian era]] have been discovered near Mamallapuram. The Sangam age poem [[Perumpāṇāṟṟuppaṭai]] relates the rule of King Thondaiman Ilam Thiraiyar at [[Kanchipuram]] of the [[Tondai Nadu]] port ''Nirppeyyaru'' which scholars identify with the present-day Mamallapuram. Chinese coins and Roman coins of [[Theodosius I]] in the 4th century CE have been found at Mamallapuram revealing the port as an active hub of global trade in the late classical period. Two [[Pallava]] coins bearing legends read as Srihari and Srinidhi have been found at Mamallapuram. The Pallava kings ruled Mamallapuram from [[Kanchipuram]]; the capital of the Pallava dynasty from the 3rd century to 9th century CE, and used the port to launch trade and diplomatic missions to [[Sri Lanka]] and Southeast Asia.

[[File:Mamallapuram Shore Temple View from beach.JPG|thumb|Mamallapuram Shore Temple View from beach]]
An 8th-century Tamil text written by [[Thirumangai Alvar]] described this place as Sea Mountain ‘where the ships rode at anchor bent to the point of breaking laden as they were with wealth, big trunked elephants and gems of nine varieties in heaps’. It is also known by several other names such as MAMALLAPATINAM and Mamallapuram. Another name by which Mamallapuram has been known to mariners, at least since [[Marco Polo]]’s time is "Seven Pagodas" alluding to the [[Seven Pagodas of Mamallapuram]] that stood on the shore, of which one, the [[Shore Temple]], survives.&lt;ref name="currentscience_20040510"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Underwater investigations off Mamallapuram|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/may102004/1231.pdf|work=Current Science|volume=86|issue=9|date=10 May 2004|authors=Sundaresh, A.

The temples of Mapuram, portraying events described in the [[Mahabharata]], were built largely during the reigns of [[Narasimhavarman]] and his successor Rajasimhavarman and show the movement from rock-cut architecture to structural building. The city of Mamallapuram was founded by the Pallava king [[Narasimhavarman I]] in the 7th century AD.&lt;ref name="currentscience_20040510"/&gt; The [[mandapa]] or pavilions and the rathas or shrines shaped as temple [[chariots]] are hewn from the [[granite]] rock face, while the famed Shore Temple, erected half a century later, is built from dressed stone. What makes Mamallapuram so culturally resonant are the influences it absorbs and disseminates. The Shore Temple includes many reliefs, including one 100&amp;nbsp;ft. long and 45&amp;nbsp;ft. high, carved out of granite.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ancient Discoveries: Lost Cities of the Deep History Channel&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important structures include:
* [[Thirukadalmallai]], the temple dedicated to Lord [[Vishnu]]. It was also built by [[Pallava]] King in order to safeguard the sculptures from the ocean.
* ''[[Descent of the Ganges (Mahabalipuram)|Descent of the Ganges]]'' or ''Arjuna's Penance'' – a giant open-air rock relief
* [[Varaha Cave Temple]] – a small rock-cut temple dating back to the 7th century.
* The [[Shore Temple]] – a structural temple along the [[Bay of Bengal]] with the entrance from the western side away from the sea. Recent excavations have revealed new structures here.
* ''[[Pancha Rathas]]'' (Five Chariots) – five monolithic pyramidal structures named after the [[Pandava]]s ([[Arjuna]], [[Bhima]], [[Yudhishtra]], [[Nakula]] and [[Sahadeva]]) and [[Draupadi]]. An interesting aspect of the rathas is that, despite their sizes they are not assembled – each of these is carved from one single large piece of stone.
*Light House, built in 1894.

A '''Minet ed Dhalia point''' or '''stylet''' is an [[archaeological]] term for an elongated, [[isosceles triangle]] made with [[pressure flaking]] on both faces of a piece of [[flint]]. They are predominantly found at sites in [[Lebanon]] (ancient [[Canaan]]).&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lorraine Copeland|author2=P. Wescombe|title=Inventory of Stone-Age sites in Lebanon, p. 49 and Figure XVI, p. 162|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YsRRwAACAAJ|accessdate=21 July 2011|year=1965|publisher=Imprimerie Catholique}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the type tool of the [[Énéolithique Ancien]] (Ancient [[Chalcolithic]]), named after the archaeological site of [[Minet ed Dhalia]] in [[Ras Beirut]]. The stylets range from {{convert|2|in|cm}} to {{convert|8|in|cm}} in length. They were first observed by Dawson in 1884 and later by [[Godefroy Zumoffen]] in 1910 and called "stylets" by [[Raoul Describes]].&lt;ref&gt;Zumoffen, Godefroy., Le Néolithiqueen Phénicie, Anthropos, Volume 5, Plate V, p. 150, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; The exact use of Minet ed Dhalia points is uncertain although the shape bears certain similarities to metal fleshing tools used in the area in modern times.&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48218">In [[linguistics]], '''mutual intelligibility''' is a relationship between [[language]]s or [[dialect]]s in which speakers of different but related [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] can readily understand each other without prior familiarity or special effort. It is sometimes used as an important criterion for distinguishing languages from dialects, although [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] factors are often also used.

Intelligibility between languages can be asymmetric, with speakers of one understanding more of the other than speakers of the other understanding the first. When it is relatively symmetric, it is characterized as "mutual". It exists in differing degrees among many related or geographically proximate languages of the world, often in the context of a [[dialect continuum]].

[[Linguistic distance]] is the name for the concept of calculating a measurement for how different languages are from one another. The higher the linguistic distance, the lower the mutual intelligibility. One common metric used is the [[Levenshtein distance]].

==Intelligibility==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}

For individuals to achieve moderate proficiency or understanding in a language (called L2) other than their [[first language]] (L1) typically requires considerable time and effort through study and/or [[Practice (learning method)|practical application]]. However, many groups of languages are partly mutually intelligible, i.e. most speakers of one language find it relatively easy to achieve some degree of understanding in the related language(s). Often the languages are [[genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetically related]], and they are likely to be similar to each other in [[grammar]], [[vocabulary]], [[pronunciation]], or other features.

Intelligibility among languages can vary between individuals or groups within a language population according to their knowledge of various registers and vocabulary in their own language, their exposure to additional related languages, their interest in or familiarity with other cultures, the domain of discussion, [[psychology|psycho]]-[[cognition|cognitive]] traits, the mode of language used (written vs. oral), and other factors.

==Mutually intelligible languages or varieties of one language==
There is no formal distinction between two distinct languages and two [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of a single language, but some linguists use mutual intelligibility as one of the primary factors in deciding between the two cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gröschel |first=Bernhard| authorlink=Bernhard Gröschel |year=2009 |language=German |title=Das Serbokroatische zwischen Linguistik und Politik: mit einer Bibliographie zum postjugoslavischen Sprachenstreit |trans-title=Serbo-Croatian Between Linguistics and Politics: With a Bibliography of the Post-Yugoslav Language Dispute |series=Lincom Studies in Slavic Linguistics ; vol 34 |location=Munich |publisher=Lincom Europa |pages=132–136 |isbn=978-3-929075-79-3 |oclc=428012015 |lccn=2009473660 |ol=15295665W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KordiJin/&gt;

Some linguists&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. P.H. Matthews, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Linguistics'', OUP 2007, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that mutual intelligibility is, ideally at least, the primary criterion separating languages from dialects. On the other hand, speakers of closely related languages can often communicate with each other; thus there are varying degrees of mutual intelligibility, and often other criteria are also used. As an example, in the case of a linear [[dialect continuum]] that shades gradually between varieties, where speakers near the center can understand the varieties at both ends, but speakers at one end cannot understand the speakers at the other end, the entire chain is often considered a single language. If the central varieties then die out and only the varieties at both ends survive, they may then be reclassified as two languages, even though no actual language change has occurred.

In addition, political and social conventions often override considerations of mutual intelligibility. For example, the [[varieties of Chinese]] are often considered a single language even though there is usually no mutual intelligibility between geographically separated varieties. Another similar example would be [[varieties of Arabic]]. In contrast, there is often significant intelligibility between different [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]], but as each of them has its own standard form, they are classified as separate languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | pages = 3–4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also significant intelligibility between [[Thai languages]] of different regions of Thailand.

To deal with the conflict in cases such as [[varieties of Arabic|Arabic]], Chinese and [[German dialects|German]], the term ''[[Abstand and ausbau languages#Roofing|Dachsprache]]'' (a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] "umbrella language") is sometimes seen: Chinese and German are languages in the sociolinguistic sense even though some speakers cannot understand each other without recourse to a standard or prestige form.&lt;!--"Macrolanguage" is jargon specific to ''Ethnologue''; it is not a normal linguistic term, and it is unreliable because it is inconsistently applied by the ''Ethnologue''.--&gt;

==Asymmetric intelligibility==
Asymmetric intelligibility refers to two languages that are considered partially mutually intelligible, but where one group of speakers has more difficulty understanding the other language than the other way around. There can be various reasons for this. If, for example, one language is related to another but has simplified its grammar, the speakers of the original language may understand the simplified language, but less vice versa. For example, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] speakers tend to find it easier to understand [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] than vice versa as a result of Afrikaans's simplified grammar&lt;ref name="gooskens"/&gt;.

Perhaps the most common reason for apparent asymmetric intelligibility is that speakers of one variety have more exposure to the other than vice versa. For example, speakers of [[Scottish English]] have frequent exposure to standard [[American English]] through movies and TV programs, whereas speakers of American English have little exposure to Scottish English; hence, American English speakers often find it difficult to understand Scottish English or, especially, [[Scots language|Scots]] (which differs significantly from standard Scottish English), whereas Scots tend to have few problems understanding standard American English.

Northern Germanic languages spoken in Scandinavia form a [[dialect continuum]] where two furthermost dialects have almost no mutual intelligibility. As such, spoken Danish and Swedish normally have low mutual intelligibility,&lt;ref name="gooskens"/&gt; but Swedes in the [[Öresund]] region (including [[Malmö]] and [[Helsingborg]]), across a strait from the Danish capital [[Copenhagen]], understand Danish somewhat better, largely due to the proximity of the region to Danish-speaking areas (see [[North Germanic languages#Mutual intelligibility|''Mutual intelligibility in North Germanic languages'']]). While Norway was under [[Denmark–Norway|Danish rule]], the [[Bokmål]] written standard of Norwegian originates from [[Dano-Norwegian]], a [[koiné]] that evolved among the urban elite in Norwegian cities during the later years of the union. Additionally, Norwegian assimilated a considerable amount of Danish vocabulary as well as traditional Danish expressions.&lt;ref name="gooskens"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/gooskens/pdf/publ_JMMD_2007.pdf |title=The Contribution of Linguistic Factors to the Intelligibility of Closely Related Languages |first=Charlotte|last=Gooskens |journal=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development|volume=28|issue=6|year=2007 |accessdate=2010-05-19|doi=10.2167/jmmd511.0|page=445|citeseerx=10.1.1.414.7645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, spoken mutual intelligibility is not reciprocal.&lt;ref name=gooskens/&gt;

Similarly, in [[Germany]] and [[Italy]], standard German or Italian speakers may have great difficulty understanding the "dialects" from regions other than their own, but virtually all "dialect" speakers learn the standard languages in school and from the media.

** The non-standard vernacular dialects of Serbo-Croatian ([[Kajkavian dialect|Kajkavian]], [[Chakavian dialect|Chakavian]] and [[Torlakian dialect|Torlakian]]) are considered by some linguists to be separate, albeit closely related languages to Serbo-Croatian (Shtokavian), rather than its dialects, as Shtokavian has its own [[Shtokavian#Classification|set of subdialects]]. Their mutual intelligibility varies greatly, both between the dialects themselves as well as with other languages. Kajkavian has higher mutual intelligibility with [[Slovene language|Slovenian]] than the national varieties of Shtokavian, while Chakavian has a low mutual intelligibility with either, in part due to large number of loanwords from [[Venetian language|Venetian]]. Torlakian (considered a subdialect of Serbian Old Shtokavian by some) has a significant level of mutual intelligibility with [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].&lt;ref name=Bul20&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F7-Bees_VvAC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;dq=%D0%97%D0%B0+%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0+%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0+%D0%BD%D0%B0+%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD+%D1%80%D1%8A%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81+%D0%BE%D1%82+18+%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BA,+%D0%B2:+%D0%91%D1%8A%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%8F%D1%82+%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BA+%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B7+%D0%A5%D0%A5+%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BA&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Българският език през ХХ век|first=Василка|last=Радева|date=15 July 2018|publisher=Pensoft Publishers|via=Google Books|isbn=9789546421135}}&lt;/ref&gt; All [[South Slavic languages]] in effect form a large [[dialect continuum]] of gradually mutually intelligible varieties depending on distance between the areas where they are spoken.

'''Nawathinehena''' is an extinct [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language formerly spoken among the [[Arapaho people]]. It had a [[phonological development]] quite different from either [[Gros Ventre language|Gros Ventre]] or [[Arapaho language|Arapaho proper]]. It has been identified as the former language of the Southern Arapaho, who switched to speaking Arapaho proper in the 19th century. However, the language is not well attested, being documented only in a vocabulary collected in 1899 by [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] from the Oklahoma Arapaho.

While it shares many important phonological innovations with Arapaho, it presents the merger of *r, *θ and *s with *t as t instead of n as in Arapaho, a sound change reminiscent of Blackfoot and Cheyenne (Goddard 1974, Jacques 2013). PA *w changes to m instead of merging with *r, *s and *n as n.

'''''Noite na Taverna''''' (in {{lang-en|A Night in the Tavern}}) is a [[short story]] collection written by [[Brazil]]ian [[Ultra-Romanticism|Ultra-Romantic]] author [[Álvares de Azevedo]] under the pen name '''Job Stern'''. It was published posthumously, in [[1855 in literature|1855]]; three years after Azevedo's death. The book is structured as a frame story containing five tales (as well as a prologue and an epilogue, thus totaling seven chapters) told by a group of five men sheltering in a [[tavern]]. It is one of the most popular and influential works of [[Gothic fiction]] in Brazilian literature.

It is said that the book was largely inspired by [[Spain|Spanish]] author [[José Cadalso]]'s 1790 work ''Noches lúgubres''.

==Plot==

===Chapter 1: "Uma Noite do Século"===
The first chapter of the book, "Uma Noite do Século" ("A Night of the Century"), introduces its setting – a tavern in an undisclosed location filled with prostitutes, drunkards and libertines. At a nearby table, influenced by the alcohol, a group of five friends – Solfieri, Bertram, Gennaro, Claudius Hermann and Johann – decide to share with each other certain events of their lives. The five tales have, in common, aspects such as unsuccessful love stories, [[cannibalism]], [[murder]]s, [[sexual violence]], [[Alcoholism|heavy drinking]], among others.

===Chapter 2: "Solfieri"===
When in [[Rome]], on a rainy night, Solfieri sees a shadow crying over a window. He realizes it is a beautiful woman. She leaves the house and Solfieri decides to follow her, and they ultimately arrive at a nearby cemetery. There, the woman cries, kneeling before a headstone, as Solfieri falls asleep watching her from afar.

One year later, Solfieri, wandering the streets of Rome after taking part in an [[orgy]], ends into a church inadvertently. He sees a coffin and, after listening to breathing noises inside, opens it, and sees the cemetery lady he met the year before inside it. After realizing that she is still alive (but in a [[catalepsy|catalepsic]] state), he carries her through the city. Arriving at his home, the woman dies two days later, of a very high fever. Solfieri buries her under the floorboards of his bedroom and pays a sculptor for a statuette built in the woman's likeness.

===Chapter 3: "Bertram"===
Bertram tells the story of his ill-fated love for a [[Spain|Spanish]] woman from [[Cádiz]], named Angela. Amidst their romance, Bertram's sick father, living in [[Denmark]], calls for him. He goes, returning two years later; however, during the time he was away, Angela marries another man, having a son with him. Despite this, Bertram tries to maintain his affair with her, but Angela's husband finds out everything. Before her husband kills her, she kills him and her child, and flees with Bertram.

One day, without further explanations, she leaves him. Bertram sinks into despair as he tries to forget Angela; subdued by woe, he faints in the middle of a street and is run over by a chariot. The passengers of the chariot, an old man and his 18-year-old daughter, help him and take him to their mansion so he can recover. Bertram gets in love with the lady and they flee together, but he ultimately gets bored with her and sells the lady to a pirate in a card game. Later, he would learn that the girl poisoned the pirate and threw herself in the sea.

Having moved to [[Italy]], Bertram decides to kill himself there, but when he is about to do it, he is saved by a sailor whom he kills unintentionally. Bertram spends some time in the sailor's ship (a [[corvette]]), where he gets in love with the [[Captain (naval)|captain]]'s wife, being requited.

In the midst of this affair, the ship is attacked by pirates and sinks, but not without making the other one sink too. The captain, his wife, Bertram and two other unnamed sailors are able to save themselves in a [[raft]]. Some time later, with no water or food, the two unnamed sailors being washed out by the sea, the three lot in order to discover who will be killed and serve as food for the others. The chosen one is the captain, but he does not accept his fate and fights for his life. He loses the fight however, and Bertram and the woman are obligated to eat him because of the lack of food, maintaining themselves for two days.

Arriving at a beach, both already weakened by hunger, the woman asks Bertram for a last moment of love before her death. Afraid of dying, Bertram strangles her and lives at the beach in complete solitude until he is found by a British [[brig]] that rescues him.

===Chapter 4: "Gennaro"===
The painter Gennaro reminisces of when he was the young apprentice of the famous Godofredo Walsh. Walsh had a young, beautiful wife named Nauza (whom Gennaro loved) and a young, beautiful daughter named Laura (who loved Gennaro). One day, Laura gets pregnant of Gennaro, but when she proposes marriage to him, he declines. Displeased, she gradually sinks into [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and dies, taking the baby with her.

The old painter, not knowing anything, visits his daughter's bedroom every night and, because of this, Gennaro starts sleeping with his wife. However, the painter is able to make Gennaro confess everything in a certain night. Days later, Godofredo takes Gennaro to a cliff and tries to kill him; however, he survives the fall and decides to return to Godofredo's house – initially planning to apologize, but later he changes his mind and decides to take his revenge on the painter and murder him. However, when he arrives at the painter's house, he finds both Nauza and Godofredo dead.

===Chapter 5: "Claudius Hermann"===
Claudius Hermann, an assiduous [[gambling|gambler]], spots the beautiful Duchess Eleonora at a [[horse racing|horse race]] and falls in love with her at first sight. He meets her once more in a [[theatre]] later on, and during an entire week he [[stalking|stalks]] her.

In a certain night, he [[bribery|bribes]] one of the duchess' lackeys for permission to enter her house for an hour, and also obtains a copy of her bedroom's keys. He puts [[sedative]] in the duchess' wine and has sex with her, returning for many nights.

One day, however, her husband, [[Duke]] Maffio, inadvertently drinks some of the sedative as well. Desperate and afraid of being caught, Claudius plans to kill him, but changes his mind and kidnaps Eleonora instead while she is still sleeping. Arriving in an [[inn]], she wakes up, and Claudius tells her everything, forcing her to stay with him. Optionless, she accepts.

Some days later, Claudius has to leave in order to take care of some affairs; when he returns home, he finds the duchess and her husband dead.

===Chapter 6: "Johann"===
Johann's story begins in a different tavern, located in [[Paris]]. He was playing a game of [[Carom billiards|carambole]] with a blond-haired man named Arthur. Johann was losing the game, while Arthur only needed to score one point to win. When it is Johann's turn to play, Arthur bumps into the table (accidentally or not), detouring Johann's ball, thus making him lose the game. Infuriated, he defies Arthur to a duel, which he accepts. They stop at a [[hotel]] to get the guns, and the blond man writes two letters. They head to a deserted and dark street. In there, they choose their guns – but only one is loaded.

They shoot. It is revealed that Johann's gun was the loaded one, and Arthur, before supposedly dying, hands Johann the letters he wrote. The first letter is addressed to Arthur's mother, and the other one is addressed to his girlfriend; he also hands Johann her address and an engagement ring. Pretending to be Arthur, Johann then decides to steal his girlfriend.

In the morning after they sleep together, Johann is attacked by a mysterious man. After a short struggle, he kills the man. However, after a close inspection, he discovers that the man he killed was his own brother, and Arthur's girlfriend was his sister.

===Chapter 7: "Último Beijo de Amor"===
In the last chapter, "Último Beijo de Amor" ("Last Love Kiss"), the orgy ends; everyone is sleeping. A mysterious hooded figure walks into the tavern and kills Johann, and then heads toward a man named Arnold.

The figure is revealed to be Giorgia, Johann's sister, and Arnold is actually Arthur (who was saved by a passerby after the duel) under a false name. Giorgia reveals to Arthur that she wanted to get her revenge on Johann, and having done so, the honor Johann stole from her when they slept together is finally restored.

After exchanging some love words with Arthur, both decide to commit suicide.

==Adaptations==
An [[Independent film|independent]] [[short film]] based on the book received a [[limited release]] around some Brazilian [[film festival]]s and [[arthouse cinema]]s on March 6, 2014. Directed and written by Yghor Boy, it stars Renato Basilla as Solfieri, Renan Bleastè as Bertram, Hélcio Henriques as Gennaro, Raul Figueiredo as Claudius Hermann, Sérgio Siveiro as Johann, Ricardo Merini as Arnold/Arthur and [[Mayara Constantino]] as Giorgia. Intertwined between each tale are glimpses of the academic life of [[Álvares de Azevedo]] himself, who is portrayed by Victor Mendes.

The film won the [[Prêmio ABC de Cinematografia]] for Best Direction of Photography in a Student Film in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcine.org.br/premio-abc/?id=1666&amp;/vencedores Associação Brasileira de Cinematografia: Prêmio ABC de Cinematografia – Vencedores 2015] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Obs-Paris-meridienne.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Meridian Room (or Cassini Room) at the [[Paris Observatory]], 61 avenue de l'Observatoire (14th arrondissement). The Paris meridian is traced on the floor.]]

The '''Paris meridian''' is a [[meridian (geography)|meridian line]] running through the [[Paris Observatory]] in [[Paris]], [[France]]—now longitude 2°20′14.03″ east. It was a long-standing rival to the [[Greenwich meridian]] as the [[prime meridian]] of the world. The Paris meridian arc or French meridian arc (French: ''la Méridienne de France'') is the name of the meridian arc measured along the Paris meridian. The French meridian arc was important for [[French cartography]], inasmuch as the [[Triangulation (surveying)|triangulations]] of [[France]] began with the measurement of the French meridian arc. Moreover, the French meridian arc was important for [[geodesy]] as it was one of the [[meridian arc]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s which were measured in order to determine the [[figure of the Earth]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The determination of the [[Figure of the Earth|figure of the earth]] was a problem of the highest importance in [[astronomy]], inasmuch as the diameter of the earth was the unit to which all celestial distances had to be referred.

=== French cartography and the figure of the Earth ===
[[File:La Hire 1682.jpg|thumb|Map of the French coast, corrected by the Academy of Science 1682]]In the year 1634, France ruled by [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] and [[Cardinal Richelieu]] decided that the [[Ferro Meridian|Ferro meridian]] should be used as the reference on maps, since this island is the most western position of the [[Old World]]. It was also thought to be exactly 20 degrees west of [[Paris]].

A [[France|French]] astronomer, Abbé [[Jean Picard]], [[Grade measurement|measured]] the length of a degree of [[latitude]] along the Paris meridian and computed from it the size of the Earth during 1668–1670.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/314175913|title=Full meridian of glory : perilous adventures in the competition to measure the Earth|last=Paul.|first=Murdin,|date=2009|publisher=Copernicus Books/Springer|isbn=9780387755335|location=New York|oclc=314175913}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1666, [[Louis XIV of France]] had authorized the building of an [[observatory]] [[Paris Observatory|in Paris]]. On [[Midsummer's Day]] 1667, members of the Academy of Sciences traced the future building's outline on a plot outside town near the [[Port-Royal Abbey, Paris|Port Royal abbey]], with Paris meridian exactly bisecting the site north-south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k9773412z|title=Histoire de l'Observatoire de Paris, de sa fondation à 1793 / par C.

Old maps from continental Europe often have a common grid with Paris degrees at the top and Ferro degrees offset by 20 at the bottom. [[Louis Feuillée]] also worked on this problem in 1724.
It was later found that the actual island of [[El Hierro]] itself is in fact 20°&amp;nbsp;31'&amp;nbsp; west of Paris, but the Ferro meridian was still defined as 20 degrees west of Paris.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Four generations of the Cassini family headed the [[Paris Observatory]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They directed the surveys of France for over 100 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Méridienne de Paris.jpg|thumb|Map of France 1720]]
Between 1684 and 1718 [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] and [[Jacques Cassini]], starting from Picard’s base, carried a triangulation northwards from Paris to Dunkirk and southwards from Paris to Collioure. They measured a base of 7246 [[Toise|toises]] near Perpignan, and a somewhat shorter base near Dunkirk; and from the northern portion of the arc, which had an amplitude of 2° 12′ 9″, obtained for the length of a degree 56,960 toises; while from the southern portion, of which the amplitude was 6° 18′ 57″, they obtained 57,097 toises. The immediate inference from this was that, the degree diminishing with increasing latitude, the earth must be a prolate [[spheroid]]. This conclusion was totally opposed to the theoretical investigations of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]], and accordingly the Academy of Sciences of Paris determined to apply a decisive test by the measurement of arcs at a great distance from each other—one in the neighbourhood of the equator, the other in a high latitude. Thus arose the celebrated expeditions of the French academicians [[French Geodesic Mission|to the Equator]] and to Lapland, the latter directed by [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]].
In 1740 was published in the Paris ''Mémoires'' an account, by [[César-François Cassini de Thury|Cassini de Thury]], of a remeasurement by himself and [[Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille|Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] of the meridian of Paris. With a view to determine more accurately the variation of the degree along the meridian, they divided the distance from Dunkirk to Collioure into four partial arcs of about two degrees each, by observing the latitude at five stations. The results previously obtained by Giovanni Domenico and Jacques Cassini were not confirmed, but, on the contrary, the length of the degree derived from these partial arcs showed on the whole an increase with an increasing latitude.

Between 1792 and 1798 [[Pierre Méchain]] and [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Jean-Baptiste Delambre]] surveyed the Paris meridian arc between [[Dunkirk]] and [[Barcelona]]. They extrapolated from this measurement the distance from the [[North Pole]] to the [[Equator]] which was 5 130 740 [[Toise|toises]]. As the [[metre]] had to be equal to one ten-million of this distance, it was defined as 0,513074 toises or 443,2936 [[Ligne|lignes]] of the Toise of Peru (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-26|title=Histoire du mètre|url=https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Histoire_du_m%C3%A8tre&amp;oldid=148917001|journal=Wikipédia|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, the Paris meridian's arc was recalculated with greater precision between [[Shetland]] and the [[Balearic Islands]] by the astronomer [[François Arago]], whose name now appears on the plaques or medallions tracing the route of the meridian through Paris (see below). [[Jean-Baptiste Biot|Biot]] and [[François Arago|Arago]] published their work as a fourth volume following the three volumes of "''Bases du système métrique décimal ou mesure de l'arc méridien compris entre les parallèles de Dunkerque et Barcelone''" (Basis for the decimal [[metric system]] or measurement of the meridian arc comprised between [[Dunkirk]] and [[Barcelona]]) by [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Delambre]] and [[Pierre Méchain|Méchain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=ETH-Bibliothek Zürich / Base du système métrique décimal ou mesure de l'arc du méridien...|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3931/e-rara-11803|language=en|doi=10.3931/e-rara-11803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental co-ordinates of the [[Panthéon]] were also obtained anew, by connecting the [[Panthéon]] and the [[Paris Observatory]] with the five stations of Bry-sur-Marne, Morlu, Mont Valérien, Chatillon and Montsouris, where the observations of latitude and azimuth were effected.

==== Geodesy and metrology ====
In 1860, the Russian Government at the instance of [[Otto Wilhelm von Struve]] invited the Governments of Belgium, France, Prussia and England to connect their triangulations in order to measure the length of an arc of parallel in latitude 52° and to test the accuracy of the figure and dimensions of the Earth, as derived from the measurements of arc of meridian.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=A.

==== From the Paris meridian to the Greenwich meridian ====
The United States passed an Act of Congress on 3 August 1882 authorizing the President to call an international conference to fix on a common prime meridian for time and longitude throughout the world. Before the invitations were sent out on December 1, the joint efforts of Abbe, Fleming and William Frederick Allen, Secretary of the US railways' ''General Time Convention'' and Managing Editor of the ''Travellers' Official Guide to the Railways'', had brought the US railway companies to an agreement which led to standard railway time being introduced at noon on 18 November 1883 across the nation. Although this was not legally established until 1918, there was thus a strong sense of ''fait accompli'' that preceded the [[International Meridian Conference]], although setting local times was not part of the remit of the conference.

In 1884, at the [[International Meridian Conference]] in [[Washington DC]], the [[Greenwich meridian]] was adopted as the [[prime meridian]] of the world. San Domingo, now the [[Dominican Republic]], voted against. France and Brazil abstained. The [[United Kingdom]] acceded to the [[Metre Convention]] in 1884 and to the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]] in 1898.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1911, [[Alexander Ross Clarke]] and [[Friedrich Robert Helmert]] stated in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] :

"According to the calculations made at the central bureau of the [[International Association of Geodesy|international association]] on the great meridian arc extending from the Shetland Islands, through Great Britain, France and Spain to El Aghuat in Algeria, ''a'' [the [[Earth radius|equatorial radius]] of the earth] = 6377935 metres, the [[Flattening|ellipticity]] being assumed as 1/299.15. [...] The net does not follow the meridian exactly, but deviates both to the west and to the east; actually, the [[Prime meridian (Greenwich)|meridian of Greenwich]] is nearer the mean than that of Paris (Helmert, ''Grösse d. Erde'')."&lt;ref name="Earth, Figure of the"/&gt;

The French clung to the Paris meridian as a rival to Greenwich until 1911 for timekeeping purposes and 1914 for navigation. To this day, French cartographers continue to indicate the Paris meridian on some maps.

===  From wireless telegraphy to Coordinated Universal Time ===
With the arrival of wireless telegraphy, France established a transmitter on the Eiffel Tower in order to broadcast a time signal.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The creation of the [[International Time Bureau]], seated at the [[Paris Observatory]], was decided upon during the 1912 ''Conférence internationale de l'heure radiotélégraphique''. The following year an attempt was made to regulate the international status of the bureau through the creation of an [[international convention]]. However, the convention wasn't ratified by its member countries due to the outbreak of [[World War I]]. In 1919, after the war, it was decided upon to make the bureau the executive body of the ''International Commission of Time'', one of the commissions of the then newly founded [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU).

From 1956 until 1987 the [[International Time Bureau]] was part of the Federation of Astronomical and Geophysical Data Analysis Services (FAGS). In 1987 the bureau's tasks of combining different measurements of [[International Atomic Time|Atomic Time]] were taken over by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures|BIPM]]. Its tasks related to the correction of time with respect to the [[Astronomical object|celestial]] [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] and the [[earth's rotation]] in order to realize [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] were taken over by the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service|IERS]].

== The Arago medallions ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Port du Louvre]] --&gt;
[[File:Arago medallion Paris.jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of the 135 Arago medallions.  This one is located near the [[Louvre Pyramid]].]]
In 1994 the [[Arago Association]] and the city of Paris commissioned a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] conceptual artist, [[Jan Dibbets]], to create a memorial to [[François Arago|Arago]].  Dibbets came up with the idea of setting 135 bronze medallions (although only 121 are documented in the official guide to the medallions) into the ground along the Paris meridian between the northern and southern limits of Paris: a total distance of 9.2 kilometres/5.7 miles. Each medallion is 12&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and marked with the name ARAGO plus N and S pointers.

Another project, the [[Méridienne verte|Green Meridian]] (''An 2000 — La Méridienne Verte''), aims to establish a plantation of trees along the entire length of the [[meridian arc]] in France. Several missing Arago medallions appear to have been replaced with the newer 'An 2000 — La Méridienne Verte' markers.

== Esoteric interpretations ==
{{main|Rose Line}}
In certain circles, some kind of [[occult]] or [[esoteric]] significance is ascribed to the Paris meridian; sometimes it is even perceived as a sinister axis. [[Dominique Stezepfandts]], a French conspiracy theorist, attacks the Arago medallions that supposedly trace the route of "an occult geographical line"; to him the Paris meridian is a "Masonic axis" or even "the heart of the Devil."

[[Henry Lincoln]], in his book ''The Holy Place'', argues that various ancient structures are aligned according to the Paris meridian. They even include medieval churches, built long before the meridian was established according to conventional history, and Lincoln finds it obvious that the meridian "was based upon the '[[Dolmen|cromlech]] intersect division line'." David Wood, in his book ''Genesis'', likewise ascribes a deeper significance to the Paris meridian and takes it into account when trying to decipher the geometry of the myth-encrusted village of [[Rennes-le-Château]]: The meridian passes about 350 meters (1,150&amp;nbsp;ft) west of the site of the so-called "[[Poussin tomb]]," an important location in the legends and esoteric theories relating to that place. (A skeptical discussion of these theories, including the supposed "alignments," can be found in Bill Putnam and Edwin Wood's book ''The Treasure of Rennes-le-Château - A mystery solved''.)

The ancient [[Thrace|Thracian]] city of '''Perperikon''' (also '''Perpericon'''; {{lang-bg|Перперикон}}, {{lang-el|Περπερικόν}}) is located in the Eastern [[Rhodopes]], 15&amp;nbsp;km northeast of the present-day town of [[Kardzhali]], [[Bulgaria]], on a 470 m high rocky hill, which is thought to have been a sacred place. The village of Gorna Krepost ("Upper Fortress") is located at the foot of the hill and the gold-bearing Perpereshka River flows near it. Perperikon is the largest [[megalith]] ensemble in the [[Balkans]].

It is thought that the famous Temple of Dionysius is located at this location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulgariatravel.org/en/object/311/Perperikon |title=Medieval Archaeological Complex Perperikon – town of Kardzhali |accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A visitor centre is being constructed at a cost of 2.4 million [[Euros]] funded by the [[European Union|EU]].&lt;ref name=Standart&gt;{{cite web|last=Standart|title=New Tourist Center to Be Built in the Rhodopes|url=http://paper.standartnews.com/en/article.php?d=2008-09-11&amp;article=25119|publisher=Standart, Arts &amp; Culture|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bulgarian archaeologist [[Nikolay Ovcharov]] started the excavation works at Perperikon in 2000, and revealed the remains of ancient architectural complex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novinite.com/articles/121245/Bulgarian+Archaeologist+Shows+Off+Perperikon+Finds Bulgarian Archaeologist Shows Off Perperikon Finds] October 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Human activity in the area dates back to 5000 B.C. The first traces of civilization on the hill date from the [[Bronze Age]], while the [[Pottery|ceramics]] found on the place date from the Early [[Iron Age]], as well as the impressive round [[altar]], almost 2 m in diameter, hewn out of the rocks. At Perperikon, a twelve days' journey from the sea, Medokos called himself king of Thrace after [[Sitalces]]'s death in 424 BC, but failed to hold a throne.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, ''The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46'' (Men-at-Arms), 2001, page 6: "... after Sitalkes' death, Xenophon would find that Medokos (based at Perperikon, twelve days' journey inland from the sea) called himself the king of [[Thrace]]. Medokos however was unable to stop Seuthes..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists have uncovered a giant multi-story [[palace]] and an imposing [[fortress]] built around the hill, with walls as thick as 2.8 m. This dates from the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Temple]]s and residential quarters were also constructed in the fortress. The megalithic complex has been laid in ruins and re-erected many times throughout history.

==The name "Perperikon"==
The name Perperikon (originally Hyperperakion, shortened by scribes to Perperakion or Perperikon) dates from the Middle Ages. There are at least two theories about the origin and meaning of the name, both associating it with gold and the gold-mining done in the region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perperikon.bg/home.php?cp=12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church==
[[Image:PerpericonCathedral.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Church (Cathedral)]]
A church pulpit was found by Bulgarian archeologists at the peak of the Thracian rock sanctuary on 10 September 2005. It is thought to be the first finding of the kind in Bulgaria. The pulpit was probably built at the end of the 4th century AD or the early 5th century during the reign of Byzantine [[Arcadius]] and coincided with the period of the christening of the [[Thracians]] in the [[Rhodopes]] area.

It has the form of a single nave [[basilica]] of 16.5 m length, which is the most typical form of an early [[Christianity|Christian]] religious temple. The pulpit, which is almost untouched by time, is richly decorated with stone-carved ornaments. An eagle with widespread wings is clearly seen on the rock. It also bears five inscriptions in [[Byzantine Greek language|Greek]],&lt;ref&gt;Ivan J Jordanov, ''Corpus of Byzantine seals from Bulgaria'', vol. 2 {{ISBN|954915873X}}, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; which are yet to be explained but which archaeologists suppose are liturgical writings.

One hypothesis suggests the church existed until the 14th century when it was levelled by the Ottoman invaders. At about that time it was probably sealed up and abandoned.

[[Perperek Knoll]] on [[Livingston Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Antarctica]] is named after the settlement of Perperek in connection with the Thracian holy city of Perperikon.

{{Indo-European topics}}
In [[classical antiquity]], '''Phrygia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|ɪ|dʒ|i|ə|}}; {{lang-grc|Φρυγία}}, ''Phrygía'' {{IPA-el|pʰryɡía|}}; {{lang-tr|Frigya}}) was first a kingdom in the west central part of [[Anatolia]], in what is now Asian [[Turkey]], centered on the [[Sangarios River]], later a region, often part of great empires.

Stories of the [[Greek Heroic Age|heroic age]] of [[Greek mythology]] tell of several legendary [[Phrygians|Phrygian]] kings:
* [[Gordias]], whose [[Gordian Knot]] would later be cut by [[Alexander the Great]]
* [[Midas]], who turned whatever he touched to gold
* [[Mygdon of Phrygia|Mygdon]], who warred with the [[Amazons]]

According to [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', the Phrygians participated in the [[Trojan War]] as close allies of the [[Troy|Trojans]], fighting against the [[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaeans]]. Phrygian power reached its peak in the late 8th century BC under another, historical, king: [[Midas]], who dominated most of western and central Anatolia and rivaled [[Assyria]] and [[Urartu]] for power in eastern Anatolia. This later Midas was, however, also the last independent king of Phrygia before [[Cimmerians]] sacked the Phrygian capital, [[Gordium]], around 695 BC. Phrygia then became subject to [[Lydia]], and then successively to [[Persia]], [[Alexander]] and his [[Hellenistic]] successors, [[Pergamon]], [[Rome]] and [[Byzantium]]. Phrygians gradually became assimilated into other cultures by the early medieval era; after the [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] conquest of Anatolia, the name "Phrygia" passed out of usage as a territorial designation.

== Geography ==
[[File:Map Anatolia ancient regions-en.svg|300px|thumb|left|Location of Phrygia in Anatolia]]
Phrygia describes an area on the western end of the high Anatolian plateau, an arid region quite unlike the forested lands to the north and west. Phrygia begins in the northwest where an area of dry steppe is watered by the Sakarya and [[Porsuk River|Porsuk]] river system and is home to the settlements of [[Dorylaeum]] near modern [[Eskisehir]], and the Phrygian capital [[Gordion]]. The climate is harsh with hot summers and cold winters; olives will not easily grow here and the land is mostly used for livestock grazing and the production of barley. South of Dorylaeum, there is another important Phrygian settlement, Midas City ([[Yazılıkaya, Eskişehir]]), situated in an area of hills and columns of volcanic [[tuff]].
To the south again, central Phrygia includes the cities of [[Afyonkarahisar]] (ancient Akroinon) with its marble quarries at nearby [[Docimium]] (İscehisar), and the town of [[Synnada in Phrygia|Synnada]].
At the western end of Phrygia stood the towns of [[Aizanoi]] (modern [[Çavdarhisar]]) and [[Acmonia]]. From here to the southwest lies the hilly area of Phrygia that contrasts to the bare plains of the region's heartland. Southwestern Phrygia is watered by the Maeander ([[Büyük Menderes River]]) and its tributary the [[Lycus (river of Phrygia)|Lycus]], and contains the towns of [[Laodicea on the Lycus]] and [[Hierapolis]].&lt;ref name="Barbara Levick's "&gt;Peter Thonemann (ed), 2013, ''Roman Phrygia: culture and society'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Inscriptions found at [[Gordium]] make clear that Phrygians spoke an [[Indo-European language]] with at least some vocabulary similar to [[Greek language|Greek]], and clearly not belonging to the family of [[Anatolian languages]] (such as [[Hittite language|Hittite]]) spoken by most of Phrygia's neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Brixhe, ''Phrygian'', in Roger D. Woodard (editor), ''The ancient Languages of Asia Minor'', Cambridge University Press, 2008, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/44668910/Midas-and-the-Phrygians Midas and the Phrygians, by Miltiades E. Bolaris (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the so-called [[Homeric Hymns]] describes the [[Phrygian language]] as not mutually intelligible with that of Troy.&lt;ref name="Hymns5"&gt;[[Homeric Hymns]] number 5, ''To Aphrodite''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phrygian soldiers. Detail from a reconstruction of a Phrygian building at Pararli, Turkey, 7th–6th Centuries BC.jpg|upright=1.8|thumb|Phrygian soldiers. Detail from a reconstruction of a Phrygian building at Pararli, Turkey, 7th–6th Centuries BC.]]
According to ancient tradition among Greek historians, the Phrygians anciently migrated to [[Anatolia]] from the [[Balkans]]. [[Herodotus]] says that the Phrygians were called [[Bryges]] when they lived in Europe.&lt;ref name="Herodotus-VII73"&gt;Herodotus VII.73.&lt;/ref&gt; He and other Greek writers also recorded legends about King [[Midas]] that associated him with or put his origin in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]; Herodotus, for example, says a wild rose garden in Macedonia was named after Midas.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus VII.73, VIII.138.&lt;/ref&gt; Some classical writers{{which|date=July 2015}} also connected the Phrygians with the [[Mygdones]], the name of two groups of people, one of which lived in northern Macedonia and another in [[Mysia]]. Likewise, the [[Phrygians]] have been identified{{by whom|date=July 2015}} with the [[Bebryces]], a people said to have warred with [[Mysia]] before the [[Trojan War]] and who had a king named [[Mygdon of Phrygia|Mygdon]] at roughly the same time as the Phrygians were said to have had a king named Mygdon. The classical historian [[Strabo]] groups Phrygians, [[Mygdones]], [[Mysians]], [[Bebryces]] and [[Bithynians]] together as peoples that migrated to Anatolia from the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] 7.3.3.&lt;/ref&gt; This image of Phrygians as part of a related group of northwest Anatolian cultures seems the most likely explanation for the confusion over whether [[Phrygians]], [[Bebryces]] and Anatolian Mygdones were or were not the same people.

The apparent similarity of the [[Phrygian language]] to Greek and its dissimilarity with the [[Anatolian languages]] spoken by most of their neighbors is also taken as support for a European origin of the Phrygians. Phrygian continued to be spoken until the 6th century AD, though its distinctive alphabet was lost earlier than those of most Anatolian cultures.&lt;ref name="Barbara Levick's "/&gt;

Some scholars have theorized that such a migration could have occurred more recently than classical sources suggest, and have sought to fit the Phrygian arrival into a narrative explaining the downfall of the [[Hittite Empire]] and the end of the high Bronze Age in Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this "recent migration" theory, the Phrygians invaded just before or after the collapse of the Hittite Empire at the beginning of the 12th century BC, filling the political vacuum in central-western Anatolia, and may have been counted among the "[[Sea Peoples]]" that Egyptian records credit with bringing about the Hittite collapse. The so-called Handmade Knobbed Ware found in Western Anatolia during this period has been tentatively identified as an import connected to this invasion.

However, most scholars reject such a recent Phrygian migration and accept as factual the ''[[Iliad]]'''s account that the Phrygians were established on the [[Sakarya River]] before the [[Trojan War]], and thus must have been there during the later stages of the [[Hittite Empire]], and probably earlier. These scholars seek instead to trace the Phrygians' origins among the many nations of western Anatolia who were subject to the [[Hittites]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Clapham, "Hittites and Phrygians", C&amp;AH IV:2, pp.71-121.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation also gets support from Greek legends about the founding of Phrygia's main city [[Gordium]] by [[Gordias]] and of [[Ancyra]] by [[Midas]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 1.4.5.&lt;/ref&gt; which suggest that Gordium and Ancyra were believed to date from the distant past before the Trojan War. Some scholars dismiss the claim of a Phrygian migration as a mere legend, likely arising from the coincidental similarity of their name to the [[Bryges]].

No one has conclusively identified which of the many subjects of the [[Hittites]] might have represented early Phrygians. According to a classical tradition, popularized by [[Flavius Josephus|Josephus]], Phrygia can be equated with the country called [[Togarmah]] by the ancient Hebrews, which has in turn been identified as the [[Tegarama]] of Hittite texts and Til-Garimmu of Assyrian records. [[Josephus]] called Togarmah "the Thrugrammeans, who, as the Greeks resolved, were named Phrygians". However, the Greek source cited by [[Josephus]] is unknown, and it is unclear if there was any basis for the identification other than name similarity. Scholars of the Hittites believe Tegarama was in eastern Anatolia - some locate it at [[Gürün|Gurun]] - far to the east of Phrygia. Some scholars have identified Phrygia with the [[Assuwa]] league, and noted that the ''[[Iliad]]'' mentions a Phrygian (Queen [[Hecuba]]'s brother) named [[Asius (mythology)|Asios]].&lt;ref&gt;CAH, Vol 2, Part 2, p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible early name of Phrygia could be Hapalla, the name of the easternmost province that emerged from the splintering of the Bronze Age western Anatolian empire [[Arzawa]]. However, scholars are unsure if Hapalla corresponds to Phrygia or to [[Pisidia]], further south.

[[Herodotus]] also claims that Phrygian colonists founded the [[Armenia]]n nation.&lt;ref name="Herodotus-VII73" /&gt; This is likely a reference to a third group of people called [[Mygdones]] living in northern [[Mesopotamia]] who were apparently allied to the Armenians; [[Xenophon]] describes them in his [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|''Anabasis'']] in a joint army with the [[Armenians]].{{fact|date=July 2017}} However, little is known about these eastern Mygdones, and no evidence of [[Phrygian language]] in that region has been found.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

[[Eric P. Hamp]] in his 2012 [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family tree classified the [[Phrygian language]] together with [[Italo-Celtic]] as a member of a "Northwest Indo-European" group.&lt;ref name=Hamp&gt;{{cite journal|last= Hamp|first= Eric P.|title= The Expansion of the Indo-European Languages: An Indo-Europeanist's Evolving View|journal= Sino-Platonic Papers|date= August 2013|volume= 239|page= 8,10|url= http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp239_indo_european_languages.pdf |accessdate= 25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hamp's view, Northwest Indo-Europeans are likely to have been the first inhabitants of [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] with the Pre-Phrygians moving east and south to Anatolia in the same manner as the Galatians did later on.&lt;ref name=Hamp/&gt; In 2010, Raymund Carl mentions that the [[Lausitz culture]] was one such Hallstatt-associated culture.&lt;ref&gt;Celtic from the West, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Around the time of the Trojan war===
According to the Iliad, the homeland of the Phrygians was on the [[Sakarya River|Sangarius River]], which would remain the centre of Phrygia throughout its history. Phrygia was famous for its wine and had "brave and expert" horsemen.

According to the [[Iliad]], before the [[Trojan War]], a young king [[Priam]] of [[Troy]] had taken an army to Phrygia to support it in a war against the [[Amazons]]. Homer calls the Phrygians "the people of [[Otreus]] and godlike [[Mygdon of Phrygia|Mygdon]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], [[Iliad]] III.216-225.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Euripides]], [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] and others, this Mygdon's son, [[Coroebus]], fought and died in the [[Trojan War]]; he had sued for the hand of the Trojan princess [[Cassandra]] in marriage. The name ''Otreus'' could be an eponym for [[Otroea]], a place on [[Lake Ascania]] in the vicinity of the later [[Nicaea]], and the name ''Mygdon'' is clearly an eponym for the [[Mygdones]], a people said by [[Strabo]] to live in northwest Asia Minor, and who appear to have sometimes been considered distinct from the [[Phrygians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], [[Iliad]] II.1055-1057; {{cite book|last=Smith|first=William|authorlink=William Smith (lexicographer)|title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography|publisher=J. Murray|location=London|year=1878|pages=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] believed that Mygdon's tomb was located at [[Stectorium]] in the southern Phrygian highlands, near modern [[Sandikli]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias 10.27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frigia, placca con cavaliere e grifone, 600-550 ac ca.jpg|thumb|Horseman and griffin, Phrygia, 600-550 BC.]]
According to the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', the Greek hero [[Heracles]] slew a king Mygdon of the [[Bebryces]] in a battle in northwest Anatolia that if historical would have taken place about a generation before the [[Trojan War]]. According to the story, while traveling from [[Minoa]] to the [[Amazons]], Heracles stopped in [[Mysia]] and supported the [[Mysians]] in a battle with the Bebryces.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 2.5.10.&lt;/ref&gt; According to some interpretations, Bebryces is an alternate name for Phrygians and this Mygdon is the same person mentioned in the [[Iliad]].

King [[Priam]] married the Phrygian princess Hecabe (or [[Hecuba]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], [[Iliad]] XVI.873-875.&lt;/ref&gt;) and maintained a close alliance with the Phrygians, who repaid him by fighting "ardently" in the [[Trojan War]] against the Greeks. Hecabe was a daughter of the Phrygian king [[Dymas]], son of Eioneus, son of Proteus. According to the [[Iliad]], Hecabe's younger brother [[Asius (mythology)|Asius]] also fought at Troy (see above); and [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] mentions two grandsons of Dymas that fell at the hands of [[Neoptolemus]] at the end of the Trojan War: "Two sons he slew of Meges rich in gold, Scion of Dymas - sons of high renown, cunning to hurl the dart, to drive the steed in war, and deftly cast the lance afar, born at one birth beside Sangarius' banks of Periboea to him, Celtus one, and Eubius the other." [[Teleutas]], father of the maiden [[Tecmessa]], is mentioned as another mythical Phrygian king.

There are indications in the Iliad that the heart of the Phrygian country was further north and downriver than it would be in later history. The Phrygian contingent arrives to aid [[Troy]] coming from Lake Ascania in northwest Anatolia, and is led by [[Phorcys]] and [[Ascanius]], both sons of Aretaon.

In one of the so-called [[Homeric Hymns]], Phrygia is said to be "rich in fortresses" and ruled by "famous [[Otreus]]".&lt;ref name="Hymns5" /&gt;

===Peak and destruction of the Phrygian kingdom===
[[File:Museum of Anatolian Civilizations068 kopie1.jpg|thumb|left|Detail from a reconstruction of a Phrygian building at Pararli, Turkey, 7th–6th Centuries BC; Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, [[Ankara]]. A griffin, sphinx and two centaurs are shown.]]
During the 8th century BC, the Phrygian kingdom with its capital at [[Gordium]] in the upper [[Sakarya River]] valley expanded into an empire dominating most of central and western Anatolia and encroaching upon the larger [[Assyrian Empire]] to its southeast and the kingdom of [[Urartu]] to the northeast.

According to the classical historians [[Strabo]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], I.3.21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius]] and [[Julius Africanus]], the king of Phrygia during this time was another [[Midas]]. This historical [[Midas]] is believed to be the same person named as Mita in Assyrian texts from the period and identified as king of the [[Mushki]]. Scholars figure that Assyrians called Phrygians "Mushki" because the Phrygians and [[Mushki]], an eastern Anatolian people, were at that time campaigning in a joint army.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; This Midas is thought to have reigned Phrygia at the peak of its power from about 720 BC to about 695 BC (according to Eusebius) or 676 BC (according to Julius Africanus). An Assyrian inscription mentioning "Mita", dated to 709 BC, during the reign of [[Sargon II|Sargon of Assyria]], suggests Phrygia and [[Assyria]] had struck a truce by that time. This [[Midas]] appears to have had good relations and close trade ties with the Greeks, and reputedly married an Aeolian Greek princess.

A system of writing in the [[Phrygian language]] developed and flourished in Gordium during this period, using a Phoenician-derived alphabet similar to the Greek one. A distinctive Phrygian pottery called Polished Ware appears during this period.

However, the Phrygian Kingdom was then overwhelmed by [[Cimmerians|Cimmerian]] invaders, and [[Gordium]] was sacked and destroyed. According to Strabo and others, [[Midas]] committed suicide by drinking bulls' blood.

[[File:MidasSehri.Tomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb at [[Midas]] City (6th century BC), near [[Eskişehir]]]]
A series of digs have opened [[Gordium]] as one of Turkey's most revealing archeological sites. Excavations confirm a violent destruction of Gordium around 675 BC. A tomb from the period, popularly identified as the "Tomb of Midas", revealed a wooden structure deeply buried under a vast [[tumulus]], containing grave goods, a coffin, furniture, and food offerings (Archaeological Museum, Ankara).

=== As a Lydian province ===
After their destruction of [[Gordium]], the Cimmerians remained in western Anatolia and warred with [[Lydia]], which eventually expelled them by around 620 BC, and then expanded to incorporate Phrygia, which became the Lydian empire's eastern frontier. The Gordium site reveals a considerable building program during the 6th century BC, under the domination of Lydian kings including the proverbially rich King [[Croesus]]. Meanwhile, Phrygia's former eastern subjects fell to [[Assyria]] and later to the [[Medes]].

There may be an echo of strife with Lydia and perhaps a veiled reference to royal hostages, in the legend of the twice-unlucky Phrygian prince [[Adrastus (son of Gordias)|Adrastus]], who accidentally killed his brother and exiled himself to [[Lydia]], where King [[Croesus]] welcomed him. Once again, Adrastus accidentally killed Croesus' son and then committed suicide.

=== As Persian province(s) ===
Some time in the 540s BC, Phrygia passed to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid (Great Persian) Empire]] when [[Cyrus the Great]] conquered [[Lydia]].

After [[Darius the Great]] became Persian Emperor in 521 BC, he remade the ancient trade route into the Persian "[[Royal road|Royal Road]]" and instituted administrative reforms that included setting up [[satrapies]]. The Phrygian [[satrapy]] (province) lay west of the [[Halys River]] (now [[Kızıl River]]) and east of [[Mysia]] and Lydia. Its capital was established at [[Dascylium]], modern [[Ergili]].

In the course of the 5th century, the region was divided in two administrative satrapies : [[Hellespontine Phrygia]] and Greater Phrygia.{{sfn|Scott|1995|page=183}}

=== Under Alexander and his successors ===
The Macedonian conqueror [[Alexander the Great]] passed through [[Gordium]] in 333 BC and severed the [[Gordian Knot]] in the temple of [[Sabazios]] ("[[Zeus]]"). According to a legend, possibly promulgated by Alexander's publicists, whoever untied the knot would be master of [[Asia]]. With Gordium sited on the [[Persian Royal Road]] that led through the heart of [[Anatolia]], the prophecy had some geographical plausibility. With Alexander, Phrygia became part of the wider [[Hellenistic]] world. Upon Alexander's death in 323, the [[Battle of Ipsus]] took place in 301 BC.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11739/ |title = Kingdoms of the Successors of Alexander: After the Battle of Ipsus, B.C. 301 |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1800–1884 |accessdate = 2013-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celts and Attalids ===
In the chaotic period after Alexander's death, northern Phrygia was overrun by [[Celts]], eventually to become the province of [[Galatia]]. The former capital of [[Gordium]] was captured and destroyed by the Gauls soon afterwards and disappeared from history.
 
In 188 BC, the southern remnant of Phrygia came under the control of the [[Attalids]] of [[Pergamon]]. However, the [[Phrygian language]] survived, although now written in the [[Greek alphabet]].

=== Under Rome and Byzantium ===
[[File:Dioecesis Asiana 400 AD.png|thumb|right|250px|The two Phrygian provinces within the Diocese of Asia, c. 400 AD]]
In 133 BC, the remnants of Phrygia passed to [[Rome]]. For purposes of provincial administration, the Romans maintained a divided Phrygia, attaching the northeastern part to the province of [[Galatia]] and the western portion to the province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]. During the reforms of [[Diocletian]], Phrygia was divided anew into two provinces: "Phrygia I", or Phrygia Salutaris, and Phrygia II, or Pacatiana, both under the [[Diocese of Asia]]. Salutaris with Synnada as its capital comprised the eastern portion of the region and Pacatiana with [[Laodicea on the Lycus]] as capital of the western portion. The provinces survived up to the end of the 7th century, when they were replaced by the [[Theme system]]. In the [[Byzantine]] period, most of Phrygia belonged to the [[Anatolic theme]]. It was overrun by the Turks in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Manzikert]] (1071).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Swain, Simon |author2=Adams, J. Maxwell |author3=Janse, Mark |title=Bilingualism in ancient society: language contact and the written word |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2002 |pages=246–266 |isbn=0-19-924506-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantines were finally evicted from there in the 13th century, but the name of ''Phrygia'' remained in use until the last remnant of the Byzantine Empire was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453.

== Culture ==
[[File:Titian - The Flaying of Marsyas.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Flaying of Marsyas (Titian)|Flaying of Marsyas]]'' by [[Titian]], 1570s, with King Midas at right, and the man with a knife in a [[Phrygian cap]]]]
The ruins of Gordion and Midas City prove that Phrygia had developed an advanced [[Bronze Age]] culture. This Phrygian culture interacted in a number of ways with Greek culture in various periods of history.&lt;ref name="Barbara Levick's "/&gt;

The "Great Mother", [[Cybele]], as the Greeks and Romans knew her, was originally worshiped in the [[mountain]]s of Phrygia, where she was known as "Mountain Mother". In her typical Phrygian form, she wears a long belted dress, a ''polos'' (a high cylindrical headdress), and a veil covering the whole body. The later version of Cybele was established by a pupil of [[Phidias]], the [[Sculpture|sculptor]] [[Agoracritus]], and became the image most widely adopted by Cybele's expanding following, both in the [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]] world and at [[Rome]]. It shows her humanized though still enthroned, her hand resting on an attendant lion and the other holding the ''[[Timpani|tympanon]]'', a circular frame drum, similar to a [[tambourine]].

The Phrygians also venerated [[Sabazios]], the sky and father-[[God (male deity)|god]] depicted on horseback. Although the Greeks associated Sabazios with [[Zeus]], representations of him, even in Roman times, show him as a horseman god. His conflicts with the indigenous Mother Goddess, whose creature was the [[Lunar Bull]], may be surmised in the way that Sabazios' horse places a hoof on the head of a bull, in a [[Roman sculpture#Relief sculptures|Roman relief]] at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].

The earliest traditions of [[Music of Greece|Greek music]] derived from Phrygia, transmitted through the Greek colonies in Anatolia, and included the [[Phrygian mode]], which was considered to be the warlike mode in ancient Greek music. Phrygian [[Midas]], the king of the "golden touch", was tutored in music by [[Orpheus]] himself, according to the myth. Another musical invention that came from Phrygia was the [[aulos]], a reed instrument with two pipes. 

[[Marsyas]], the [[satyr]] who first formed the instrument using the hollowed [[antler]] of a [[stag]], was a Phrygian follower of Cybele. He unwisely competed in music with the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] [[Apollo]] and inevitably lost, whereupon Apollo [[flaying|flayed]] Marsyas alive and provocatively hung his skin on Cybele's own sacred tree, a [[pine]].  Phrygia was also the scene of another musical contest, between Apollo and [[Pan (god)|Pan]].  [[Midas]] was either a judge or spectator, and said he preferred Pan's pipes to Apollo's lyre, and was given donkey's ears as a punishment.  The two stories were often confused or conflated, as by [[Titian]].  

Classical Greek iconography identifies the [[Troy|Trojan]] [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] as non-Greek by his Phrygian cap, which was worn by [[Mithras]] and survived into modern imagery as the "[[Phrygian cap|Liberty cap]]" of the American and [[French revolutionaries]].
The Phrygians spoke an [[Indo-European language]]. (''See [[Phrygian language]].'') Although the Phrygians adopted the [[alphabet]] originated by the [[Phoenicians]], only a few dozen inscriptions in the Phrygian language have been found, primarily funereal, and so much of what is thought to be known of Phrygia is second-hand information from Greek sources.

== Mythic past ==
The name of the earliest known mythical king was Nannacus (aka Annacus).&lt;ref&gt;Suidas s. v. Νάννακος; Stephanus of Byzantium s.v. Ἰκόνιον; Both passages are translated in: A new system: or, An analysis of ancient mythology by Jacob Bryant (1807) [https://books.google.com/books?id=QzoGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=annacus+phrygia&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1f2kTefUB8Ga0QH9oumHCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Pages 12-14]&lt;/ref&gt; This king resided at Iconium, the most eastern city of the kingdom of Phrygia at that time; and after his death, at the age of 300 years, a great flood overwhelmed the country, as had been foretold by an ancient oracle. The next king mentioned in extant classical sources was called Manis or Masdes. According to Plutarch, because of his splendid exploits, great things were called "manic" in Phrygia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plu/pte/pte04.htm Plutarch, On Isis and Osiris, Chapter 24]&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the kingdom of Phrygia seems to have become fragmented among various kings. One of the kings was [[Tantalus]], who ruled over the north western region of Phrygia around [[Mount Sipylus]]. Tantalus was endlessly punished in [[Tartarus]], because he allegedly killed his son [[Pelops]] and sacrificially offered him to the Olympians, a reference to the suppression of [[human sacrifice]]. Tantalus was also falsely accused of stealing from the lotteries he had invented. In the mythic age before the [[Trojan war]], during a time of an [[interregnum]], [[Gordias|Gordius]] (or Gordias), a Phrygian farmer, became king, fulfilling an oracular [[prophecy]]. The kingless Phrygians had turned for guidance to the oracle of Sabazios ("Zeus" to the Greeks) at [[Telmissus]], in the part of Phrygia that later became part of [[Galatia]]. They had been instructed by the oracle to acclaim as their king the first man who rode up to the god's temple in a cart. That man was Gordias (Gordios, Gordius), a farmer, who dedicated the ox-cart in question, tied to its shaft with the "[[Gordian Knot]]". Gordias refounded a capital at Gordium in west central Anatolia, situated on the old trackway through the heart of Anatolia that became [[Darius the Great|Darius]]'s Persian "Royal Road" from [[Pessinus]] to [[Ancyra]], and not far from the [[Sakarya River|River Sangarius]].

[[File:Phrygian.jpg|thumb|Man in Phrygian costume, [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] period (3rd&amp;ndash;1st century BC), [[Cyprus]]]]
The Phrygians are associated in Greek mythology with the [[Dactyl (mythology)|Dactyl]]s, minor gods credited with the invention of iron smelting, who in most versions of the legend lived at [[Mount Ida]] in Phrygia.

[[Gordias]]'s son (adopted in some versions) was [[Midas]]. A large body of myths and legends surround this first king Midas.&lt;ref&gt;There were seven all together&lt;/ref&gt; connecting him with a mythological tale concerning [[Attis]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias ''Description of Greece'' 7:17; Arnobius ''Against the Pagans'' 5.5&lt;/ref&gt; This shadowy figure resided at Pessinus and attempted to marry his daughter to the young Attis in spite of the opposition of his lover Agdestis and his mother, the goddess [[Cybele]]. When Agdestis and/or Cybele appear and cast madness upon the members of the wedding feast. Midas is said to have died in the ensuing chaos.

King Midas is said to have associated himself with [[Silenus]] and other satyrs and with [[Dionysus]], who granted him a "golden touch".

In one version of his story, Midas travels from [[Thrace]] accompanied by a band of his people to Asia Minor to wash away the taint of his unwelcome "golden touch" in the river [[Pactolus]]. Leaving the gold in the river's sands, Midas found himself in Phrygia, where he was adopted by the childless king Gordias and taken under the protection of Cybele. Acting as the visible representative of Cybele, and under her authority, it would seem, a Phrygian king could designate his successor.

The Phrygian [[Sibyl]] was the priestess presiding over the [[Apollonian oracle]] at Phrygia.

According to [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref&gt;''Histories'' 2.9&lt;/ref&gt; the Egyptian pharaoh [[Psammetichus II]] had two children raised in isolation in order to find the original language. The children were reported to have uttered ''bekos'', which is Phrygian for "bread", so Psammetichus admitted that the Phrygians were a nation older than the Egyptians.

== Christian period==
Visitors from Phrygia were reported to have been among the crowds present in [[Jerusalem]] on the occasion of [[Pentecost]] as recorded in {{bibleverse||Acts|2:10|NKJV}}. In {{bibleverse||Acts|16:6|NKJV}} the [[Apostle Paul]] and his companion [[Silas]] travelled through Phrygia and the region of [[Galatia]] proclaiming the [[Christian Gospel|Christian gospel]]. Their plans appear to have been to go to [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] but circumstances or guidance, "in ways which we are not told, by inner promptings, or by visions of the night, or by the inspired utterances of those among their converts who had received the gift of prophecy" &lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/acts/16.htm Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers], accessed 18 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; prevented them from doing so and instead they travelled westwards towards the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|16:7-8|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian heresy known as [[Montanism]], and still known in [[Orthodoxy]] as "the Phrygian heresy", arose in the unidentified village of Ardabau in the 2nd century AD, and was distinguished by ecstatic spirituality and women priests. Originally described as a rural movement, it is now thought to have been of urban origin like other Christian developments. The new Jerusalem its adherents founded in the village of Pepouza has now been identified in a remote valley that later held a monastery.&lt;ref name="Barbara Levick's "/&gt;

'''''Saint Francis in Meditation''''' (c. 1604/06 or 1607/10), is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] master [[Caravaggio]], in the [[Museo Civico Ala Ponzone, Cremona|Museo Civico]], [[Cremona]].

This is one of two paintings of almost identical measurements showing [[Saint Francis of Assisi]] contemplating a skull (see ''[[Saint Francis in Prayer (Caravaggio)|Saint Francis in Prayer]]'') - neither is documented and both are disputed, although the dispute is as to whether they are originals or copies. The dating of both is highly uncertain, although the cypress trunk behind this Saint Francis is very reminiscent of the tree behind the Corsini ''[[John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|John the Baptist]]''. St Francis was a popular subject during the [[Counter-Reformation]], when the Church stressed - at least officially - the virtues of poverty and the imitation of Christ.

{{1984 Summer Olympics}}
'''Sam the Olympic Eagle''' was the [[Olympic mascot|mascot]] of the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] which were held in [[Los Angeles]]. He is a [[bald eagle]], which is the national bird of the [[United States]], where the games were held. Intended as a patriotic symbol, being named Sam also suggests a kinship with [[Uncle Sam]], another American symbol. The mascot was designed by [[Bob Moore (Disney artist)|Bob Moore]], an artist for [[Disney]].

Guests of [[Disneyland]], as well as those reading documentation about mascot designs for the [[Olympics]], often confuse the mascot for another Disney mascot named ''Eagle Sam'', host of the former [[Disneyland]] attraction [[America Sings]], and designed by animator [[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc Davis]] in c. 1973. He shares the name of [[Sam Eagle|Sam the Eagle]] from ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', but the design is vastly different. He is still known as Eagle Sam in [[Japan]], where an animated series of the same name ran during 1983, the year preceding the Summer Olympics. Even after the conclusion of the Games, Sam the Eagle is still used to promote a [[track and field]] event, the Mt. SAC Relays at [[Mt. San Antonio College]], specifically its "[[LA84 Foundation|LA84]] Youth Days" promotion for youth interested in athletics, run by a charitable group founded during the Olympics.

'''Samuel Tyler Lawrence''' (November 21, 1786 – December 18, 1847) was resident of New York in the 1820s who was an early associate of [[Joseph Smith]], the founder of the [[Latter-day Saint movement]]. Lawrence moved from [[New Jersey]] to [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra, New York]], with sister Fanny and her husband [[Abner Cole]]. Lawrence and Smith reportedly engaged in "money-digging" (or treasure hunting).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Palmer |first= Grant H |authorlink= Grant H.

Later Lawrence moved to [[Oswego, New York]], where he died.&lt;ref name="autogenerated38"&gt;{{citation |last= Troll |first= Rich |date=Summer 2006 |title= Samuel Tyler Lawrence: A Significant Figure in Joseph Smith's Palmyra Past |journal= [[Journal of Mormon History]] |volume= 32 |issue= 2 |pages= 38–86 |url= http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1047&amp;context=mormonhistory }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Lawrence was born in New Jersey to Sylvanus and Jemima Lawrence. He had an older brother, Daniel, and an adopted sister, Frances "Fanny" Wickham Darling, a biological first cousin who was adopted into the family and took the last name Lawrence.

By 1811, Lawrence and Rachel Bryant (born 1793) were married, and the two had at least one daughter, Frances Maria.

==In Palmyra==

Around 1820, Lawrence and his family moved to Palmyra. Samuel's sister Fanny and her husband [[Abner Cole]] had resided in Palmyra since 1812.

In Palmyra, Lawrence developed a reputation as a [[Clairvoyance|seer]] and a treasure-hunter. Lawrence was part of a company of "money-diggers" that included [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]], [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], [[Hyrum Smith]], George Proper, Josiah Stowell, and Alva Beaman.

[[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], a [[Three Witnesses|witness]] to the [[Book of Mormon]]'s [[golden plates]], later recalled a tale of an encounter between the money-diggers and a "treasure guardian": 
:"Samuel Lawrence told me that while they were digging, a large man who appeared to be eight or nine feet high, came and sat on the ridge of the barn, and motioned to them that they must leave. They motioned back that they would not; but that they afterwards became frightened and did leave."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olivercowdery.com/smithhome/1850s/1859Tiff.htm |title=Smith History Vault: 1859 Joel Tiffany Articles |publisher=Olivercowdery.com |date=2009-03-19 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2013}}

Another resident, Joseph Capron, recalled when the company "discovered" a chest of gold watches, but they were "in the possession of the evil spirit".   Lawrence, reportedly "with a drawn sword in his hand, marched around to guard any assault which his Satanic majesty might be disposed to make."  The dig ended without success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://signaturebookslibrary.org/?p=373 |title=Joseph Smith’s Reputation – Appendix A &amp;#124; |publisher=Signaturebookslibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one account, Lawrence traveled with Smith to [[Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania|Harmony, Pennsylvania]], to search for a silver mine, during which Lawrence recommended Smith to [[Emma Smith|Emma Hale]], Smith's future wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs/1834howf.htm |title=E.

Howe's Mormonism Unvailed, (Part 5 of 5) |publisher=Solomonspalding.com |date=2006-08-17 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lY3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA68 |title=The History of the Saints: Or, An Exposé of Joe Smith and Mormonism - John C. Bennett - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawrence and the golden plates==
Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, claimed the [[Book of Mormon]] was a translation of [[golden plates]] which Smith had been guided to by an [[Angel Moroni|angel]]. Lawrence figures in some of the discovery narratives of the golden plates.

[[Willard Chase]] recalled in 1833 that Smith had been told by a spirit "to come again, in just one year, and bring a man with him".  According to Chase, Smith at one point "believed that one Samuel T. Lawrence was the man alluded to by the spirit" and reportedly took Lawrence "to a singular looking hill, in Manchester, and showed him where the treasure was." According to the account, Smith later changed his mind and decided Lawrence was not the "right man".{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

[[Joseph Knight, Sr.]] recalled that "Joseph was some afraid of Samuel Lawrence that he might be a trouble to him." Therefore, prior to retrieving the golden plates on September 22, 1827, Smith sent his father to Lawrence's residence "to see if there was any signs of his going away that night."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sedgwickresearch.com/knight/joseph_knightsr.htm |title=Joseph Knight Recollections |publisher=Sedgwick Research |date= |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/transcripts/I00046-Joseph_Knights_Recollection_of_Early_Mormon_History.html |title=Joseph Knight's Recollection of Early Mormon History |publisher=Maxwellinstitute.byu.edu |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 1853 book, [[Lucy Mack Smith]] recalled her husband's visit to the Lawrence house, writing that "he could overhear their conversation" and they were "devising many plans and schemes to find 'Joe Smith's gold bible'." Reportedly, Lawrence's wife warned her husband "'Sam, Sam,' said she. 'You are cutting your own throat.' At this, the conjuror bawled out at the top of his voice, 'I am not afraid of anybody. We will have the plates in spite of Joe Smith or all the devils in hell.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfTheProphetJosephSmithByHisMotherLucyMackSmith |title=History of the Prophet Joseph Smith by his mother Lucy Mack Smith : Lucy Mack Smith : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2014-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In May 1830, Lawrence was operating the Palmyra Bathing House, and served as a subscription collector for his brother-in-law's paper the ''Liberal Advocate''.

On April 17, 1833, Lawrence was indicted for "fraudulently secreting property". Lawrence and his brother Daniel moved with their families to Oswego, New York by the autumn of 1833. He died at Oswego.&lt;ref name="autogenerated38"/&gt;

'''Serpent Mounds Park''' is a former historical and recreational park located in [[Keene, Ontario]]. Serpent Mounds operated as a provincial park, established in 1955 through a lease with the [[Hiawatha First Nation]], a historic [[Mississaugas]] people. During this time, in 1982, the mounds were designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]], comprising six sites, including on [east] Sugar Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The park has been closed since 2009.

==History==
[[Archaeological]] field work on the campground has revealed that the construction and occupation of the Serpent Mounds area occurred about 2000 years ago during the [[prehistoric]] [[Middle Woodland Period]]. The first prehistoric peoples to occupy the site were classified by archaeologists as the [[Point Peninsula Complex]], based on their [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]].  The people existed in central and southeastern [[Ontario]], southwestern [[Quebec]], and northern parts [[New York state]] between 300BC and 700AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Prehistory of Ontario

[[File:Symbol of Signalism, an international neo-avant-garde movement.jpg|thumb|right|Symbol of Signalism]]
'''Signalism''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Сигнализам}} / Signalizam; from: [[Latin language|lat.]] Signum – ''sign, signal'') represents an international neo-[[avant-garde]] literal and art movement. It gathered wider support base both in former [[Yugoslavia]] and the world in the late 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/signalizam/delo/11166 "Signalism in lexicons"] (entries from Yugoslav editions, in English), Signalism @ Project Rastko, e-library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Živković, Živan. [http://www.rastko.org.rs/knjizevnost/signalizam/delo/11292 "Quarter of century of Signalism"], 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The origins and methods of Signalism ==

The beginning of Signalism dates back to 1959 when its founder and main theoretician [[Miroljub Todorović]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/signalizam/delo/11297 Miroljub Todorović: Bio-bibliography], Signalism @ Project Rastko, e-library&lt;/ref&gt; started with his linguistic experiments. His main belief was that there can be no significant leap forward in poetry without revolutionizing its main medium – the language.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Daligand. [http://www.rastko.rs/rastko/delo/12312 Signalisme et pansemiotique] (2007), Signalism @ Project Rastko, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Pet., "Signalizam", an entry in: ''Enciklopedija srpskog naroda'', Belgrade, 2008, str. 1002; also: B.S-P-, ''Todorović Miroljub'' in: ''Enciklopedija srpskog naroda'', Belgrade, 2008, str. 1133.&lt;/ref&gt;

The birth of Signalism in [[Serbian literature]] and [[Serbian culture|culture]], with its tendency to revolutionize other arts as well (visual, theater, comics,&lt;ref&gt;Branislav Miltojević. ''Antologija niškog stripa'', Prosveta, Niš, 2004, pp. 72, 265-268&lt;/ref&gt; music and movies),&lt;ref&gt;Pavle Levi. [https://books.google.com/books?id=cVYIFprvPVkC&amp;pg=PA98 ''Cinema by Other Means''], Oxford University Press, 2012, pp 98-104&lt;/ref&gt; came from the need to eliminate the spent models carried on by poetic and cultural traditions, as well as from the necessity to take on the challenges and spirit of the modern technological and electronic civilization. In its program ("Manifesto" and other guiding texts)&lt;ref&gt;Miroljub Todorović. [http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/signalizam/delo/11192 ''Manifestos and other Essays''] (1969-1975)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in its art pieces, Signalism made a clean break from the principles of neoromantism and late [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] still governing Serbian literature. Its goal was set to radically change poetry both through content and form, and make it compatible with the contemporary times.

Revolutionizing of the poetic language started with the introduction of the symbols, formulas and linguistic forms of the "hard" sciences (physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, biochemistry and astronomy). Furthermore, the language was made visual by dispersing words and sentences into syllables and letters forming visually recognizable patterns,&lt;ref&gt;Adriano Spatola, Brendan W. Hennessey, Guy Bennett. [https://books.google.com/books?id=h60aAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=signalism&amp;dq=signalism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uXqlU9f8C8-M0wWh1ICoAQ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Toward Total Poetry''], Otis Books/Seismicity Editions, 2008, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as by introducing non-verbal symbols into the text (drawings, photographs, graphs…) for the purpose of creating a collage of verbal and visual elements.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. dr Dagmar Burkhart, [http://signalizamusvetu.blogspot.com/2014/03/prof.html „Od Carmina figurata ka vizuelnoj poeziji"], ''Signal'', Belgrade, no. 25-26-27, 2003, 3-10.&lt;/ref&gt; This first phase of Signalism is often referred to as ''Scientism'', with the most prominent examples including the books "Planeta" (Planet, 1965) and "Putovanje u Zvezdaliju" (A trip to Starland, 1971) as well as poetry cycles "Belančevina" (Protein), "Kiseonik" (Oxygen), "Ožilište" (Nursery) and others in which the topics are Space, Time and Matter.

In their for decade long research and creative pursuit that followed, Signalists significantly expanded cognitive boundaries and genre profile of modern Serbian poetry. Signalist poetry can be divided into two main forms: verbal and non-verbal. Verbal poetry consists of scientist, aleatoric (random), stochastic, technological, phenomenological, slang and apeironistic poetry. Non-verbal poetry subtypes include visual, object, sound and gestual poetry.

Signalism made significant advances in prose (experimental novel and short story). There is also a number of significant Signalist children literature accomplishments. In visual art strides are made in [[body art]], [[mail art]],&lt;ref&gt;Džon Held. ''Mejl-Art signalizam'', ''Književni magazin'', broj 91-92, Belgrade, 2009, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; performance and [[conceptual art]].

Three manifestos helped define Signalism as a neo-avant-garde movement that negates literal, artistic and cultural heritage, poetic and aesthetic conventions and canonical ways of creativity by insisting on creative experimentation – "Manifesto of scientific poetry" (1968), "Signalist manifesto (Regulae poesis)" (1969) and "Signalism" (1970).

The movement was significantly boosted by the [[Signal, International Review of Signalist Research|international magazine "Signal"]], inaugurated in 1970. Nine issues of "Signal" appeared between 1970 and 1973, presenting a number of domestic and international artists, as well as printing bibliographical data about the avant-garde publications all around the world. From 1973 until 1995 magazine could not be published, mainly for financial reasons. From 1995 to 2004 another 21 issues of "Signal" appeared. The new release of "Signal" revitalized the Signalist movement and brought an army of young artists into the movement in 21st century.

On the work of Miroljub Todorović and Signalism movement that he had founded, three doctoral dissertations have been defended:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/signalizam/delo/11296 "Three dissertations about Signalism" (Biserka Rajčić: 'Kornhauser's study'; Dragoljub P. Đurić: 'Dissertation on Signalism'; Radovan Vučković: 'Radical disproval of tradition)], Signalism @ Project Rastko&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Julian Kornhauser, Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland, 1980; Dr. Živan Živković, Faculty of Philology in Belgrade, 1991 and Dr. Milivoje Pavlović, University of Kosovska Mitrovica, 2002. Twenty monographs have also been published on the same subject.

== The most important authors and works of Signalism ==

Many poets, writers and painters accepted the basic concepts of Signalism, further developing and spreading the ideas of this Serbian (Yugoslav) neo-avant-garde movement.

Besides the founder of Signalism [[Miroljub Todorović]] (''Kyberno'', 1970; ''The Pig is an Excellent Swimmer'', 1971; ''Bumpkin Shows Off'', slang poetry, 1974; ''Insect on the Temple'', 1978; ''Algol'', 1980, ''Textum'', 1981; ''Chinese Erotism'', 1983; ''Knock-Out'', 1984; ''I Mount Rocinante Again'', 1987; ''Water-Snake Drinks Water'', 1988; ''The Diary of Avant-Garde'', 1990; ''Electric Chair'', slang poetry, 1998; ''I’ve Just Opened my Mail'', 2000; ''It Walked Into my Ear'', slang stories, 2005; ''Blue Wind'', 2006; ''Slang Stories'', 2007;) important contributors to the theory and practice of Signalism include [[Marina Abramović]], [[Vlada Stojiljković]], [[Zvonimir Kostić Palanski]], [[Slobodan Pavićević]] (''Flowers’ Silicates'', 1973; ''Roadworks'', 1984), [[Milivoje Pavlović]] (''White Book'', 1974; ''The World In Signals'', 1996), [[Zoran Popović (writer)|Zoran Popović]], [[Ljubiša Jocić]] (''Moonshine in Tetrapack'', 1975; ''What’s the Time'', 1976: ''Essays on Signalism'', 1994), [[Jaroslav Supek]], [[Zvonko Sarić]] (''Overcoat until the Dawn'', 2001; ''Soul Catcher'', 2003), [[Bogislav Marković]] (''Altai Dust'', 2006), [[Ilija Bakić]] (''Prenatal Life'', 1997; ''New Babylon'', 1998; ''Protoplasm'', 2003; ''The Autumn of Gatherers'', 2007; ''To be Continued'', 2009), [[Slobodan Škerović]] (''Indigo'', 2005; ''All Colors of Arcturus'', 2006; ''Chimera or Borg'', 2008), [[Žarko Đurović (writer)|Žarko Đurović]] (''The World of Signalism'', 2002), [[Dušan Vidaković]], [[Dobrivoje Jevtić]], [[Dejan Bogojević]], [[Andrej Tišma]], [[Dobrica Kamperelić]], [[Milivoj Anđelković]], [[Zoran Stefanović]] and others.

== Critical reception ==

Numerous domestic and international critics and theoreticians hold Signalism in high regard:

Prof. [[Miloš Bandić]]: "Signalism is – after [[Zenitism]], [[Surrealism]] and the movement of social literature – the next and autochthonous literary and artistic movement in Serbian literature of 20th century. At the same time, in contemporary Yugoslav literature and culture, Signalism is confirmed as an exclusive modern dimension and a separate artistic form and production. Without it all would probably be poorer and who knows how deprived."

[[Oskar Davičo]], famous writer: "For the first time from the appearance of Surrealism in the twenties, we can joyfully confirm that with exploration of Miroljub Todorović, Serbian poetry can again catch up with the genuine worldwide avant-garde explorations."

[[Zoran Markuš]], visual arts critic: "Signalism is our parallel phenomena within the brackets of the most extreme avant-garde and that explains its international expansion, approval and importance in certain artistic and intellectual circles."

[[Dave Oz]], Canadian multimedia artist: "True essence of Signalism is that it expects appearance of planetary consciousness."

[[Gillo Dorfles]], Italian arts theoretician: "Signalism means a step forward, in relation to concrete poetry, visual poetry and the art of the sign."

Prof. Milivoje Pavlović: "Thanks to Miroljub Todorović and the group that follows him, Signalism with its mainstream represents the arc which connects in a creative manner avant-garde aims from the period between wars with the contemporary epoch, bringing valuable innovations and connecting Serbian art with the modern world’s processes." (From the book ''The Keys of Signalist Poetics'')

The result of this experiment concluded that the Soanian techno-complex contains a Mode 3 [[Levallois technique]] core component.&lt;ref name="sites.google.com"/&gt;

At [[Adiala]] and [[Khasala Kalan]], about {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Rawalpindi]] terrace on the bend of the river, hundreds of edged pebble tools were discovered. At [[Chauntra]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[hand axe]]s and cleavers were found. Tools up to two million years old have been recovered. In the Soan River Gorge, many [[fossil]] bearing rocks are exposed on the surface. 14 million year old fossils of [[gazelle]], [[rhinoceros]], [[crocodile]], [[giraffe]] and [[rodent]]s have been found there. Some of these fossils are on display at the [[Pakistan Museum of Natural History]] in [[Islamabad]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Temple mount works.jpg|thumb|250px|Excavations taking place atop the [[Temple Mount]] by the Islamic Waqf, which many experts believe destroys valuable archaeological data]]  --&gt;
The '''Temple Mount Sifting Project''' (formerly known as the '''Temple Mount Salvage Operation''') is an [[Israel]]i archaeological project begun in 2004 dedicated for the purpose of recovering archaeological artifacts from 400 truckloads of topsoil removed from the [[Temple Mount]] by the ''[[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf|Waqf]]'' during the construction of the underground [[Solomon's Stables|el-Marwani Mosque]] from 1996 to 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echad.info/sifting/media/jpost14-4-05.html Temple Mount relics saved from garbage, [[Jerusalem Post]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The project is under the academic auspices of [[Bar Ilan University]] and until 2017 was funded by the [[Ir David Foundation]] and [[Israel Exploration Society]]. 

In April 2017, the project announced that the [[Ir David Foundation]] suddenly decided to stop funding the project and, as a result, the sifting part of the project would be closed. Also the funding that was promised to them by [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] has never been received. The project has since started to raise money using [[crowdfunding]]. The target is 250,000 [[Israeli new shekel]] in order to complete the study of the items that were already found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tmsifting.org/en/ In Response to the Prime Minister]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.giveback.co.il/project.aspx?id=564&amp;lan=he-IL Save the remnants of our past (In Hebrew)]&lt;/ref&gt;Since 2017 the project has been funded by the Israel Archaeology Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/jerusalem/Temple-Mount-sifting-project-at-a-crossroads-500232|title=Temple Mount sifting project at a crossroads|work=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The renovation of Solomon's Stables, which is 18,000 square feet (1,700 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and 36 feet (11 m) deep, entailed excavating layers of earth accumulated near its northern archways since medieval times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echad.info/sifting/reports/third_pri_report.pdf/ Temple Mount Sifting Project - 3rd preliminary report (Hebrew), p. 55] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901024331/http://www.echad.info/sifting/reports/third_pri_report.pdf |date=2013-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The project necessitated the use of heavy earth moving equipment. About 60 truckloads full of stones and earth were taken to an organic garbage dump in nearby [[al-Eizariya]], and could not be retrieved,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/jan/2/20060102-123421-5168r/ Artifacts with links to Bible unearthed, Washington Times]&lt;/ref&gt; but most of the debris (about 350 truckloads) was dumped in the [[Kidron Valley]], near the north-eastern corner of the old city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echad.info/sifting/reports/first_pri_report.pdf Temple Mount Sifting Project - 1st Preliminary Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the supervision of Israeli archaeologists [[Gabriel Barkay]] and [[Zachi Dvira|Zachi Dvira (Zweig)]] of Bar Ilan University, the soil is being sifted in search of artifacts.&lt;ref name=gilbert&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Digging-out-the-truth Digging out the truth, [[Jerusalem Post]] ]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dore Gold]] has called the removal of archaeological material from the Temple Mount without archaeological supervision, by the Waqf, a physical form of [[Denial of the Temple in Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;The fight for Jerusalem: radical Islam, the west, and the future of the Holy City, Dore Gold, Regnery Publishing, 2007, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is being carried out at a site in the [[Emek Tzurim National Park]], at the foot of [[Mt. Scopus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tmsifting.org/en/ Temple Mount Antiquities Salvage Operation]&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of artifacts have been found, including coins and jewelry, some with biblical links dating back more than three millennia.&lt;ref name="Unearthed"&gt;[http://tmsifting.org/sifting/media/WTimes02-01-06.htm Biblical artifacts unearthed]&lt;/ref&gt; The workers use a technique called "wet sifting," similar to panning for gold. Every particle is examined, using wire filters that are rinsed under water.&lt;ref name="Unearthed"/&gt; The work is being done inside a large greenhouse covered in plastic sheets. The contents of black plastic buckets filled with stones and pebbles are emptied onto wooden-framed screens, hosed down and sorted for items of potential importance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/What-is-Beneath-the-Temple-Mount.html What is beneath the Temple Mount]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, in 2017 the sifting of material from the Temple Mount was stopped because of the shortage of funds. The Temple Mount Sifting project team is planning to resume the sifting as soon as they have procured the funding necessary to complete and publish the research on the half a million artifacts that have already been found.  

Though the team still does not have the government funding necessary to restart the sifting, everybody can still help. For supporters, the sifting project team is offering tours of their research laboratory where everyone can see all of their special finds and learn about them from one of the expert archaeologists.

These tours are a way of saying thank you to the Temple Mount Sifting project supporters. For these gifts, the donation collected goes to support their project’s research and the process of resuming the sifting itself.

==Significant finds==
*  First Temple period [[Bulla (seal)|bulla]]&amp;mdash;a piece of hardened clay with a seal impression upon it,  c. 2,600 years old. The inscription bears part of priestly official's name, [Haza]lyahu son of Immer.&lt;ref name=gilbert/&gt;
* An iron arrowhead with a shaft, used by the Tenth Roman Legion during the siege of the Second Temple&lt;ref name="Unearthed"/&gt;
* Scores of coins, many of them Jewish and minted by the Hasmonean and Herodian dynasty, others Byzantine. More recent coins date from the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Unearthed"/&gt;
* A bronze pendant several hundred years old depicting the [[Holy Grail]]&lt;ref name="Unearthed"/&gt;
* Hundreds of fragments of floor tiles of the paving technique known as ''Opus Sectile'' from the Herodian period
* Thousands of architectural element fragments from the Byzantine period

'''''Us Against Them: Ethnocentric Foundations of American Opinion''''' is a book of social science research by [[Donald Kinder]] and [[Cindy Kam]] published by the [[University of Chicago Press]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="PublishersPage"&gt;{{cite web|title=Us Against Them, publisher's page|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/U/bo8273958.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Us Against Them'' uses polling data to argue that white voters who identify as ethnic Americans strongly oppose those means-tested programs that they view as transferring wealth directly to members of racial and ethnic minority groups, including food stamps, welfare, and [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families]], but support programs they see as  universal social-insurance, including Medicare and Social Security.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Appelbaum|first1=Yoni|title=Trump Wants to Make Government Huge Again|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/trump-government-ethnocentrism/473538/|accessdate=13 March 2016|publisher=The Atlantic|date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Darren W.. 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4732">The online project '''Virtual Laboratory. Essays and Resources on the Experimentalization of Life, 1830-1930''', located at the [[Max Planck Institute for the History of Science]], is dedicated to research in the history of the experimentalization of life. The term experimentalization describes the interaction between the [[life sciences]], [[art|the arts]], [[architecture]], [[Mass media|media]] and [[technology]] within the experimental paradigm, ca. 1830 to 1930. The Virtual Laboratory is a platform that not only presents work on this topic but also acts as a research environment for new studies.

==History==
In 1977, the first version of the Virtual Laboratory was presented, titled '''Virtual Laboratory of Physiology'''. At this time, the main focus lay on the development of technological preconditions of physiological research in the 19th century. Therefore, a database with relevant texts and images was created. In 1998, the concept still used today was created after a series of modifications, followed by the publication of a cd-ROM in 1999. At this time, the focus had been expanded from [[physiology]] to the [[life sciences]] in general, as well as the arts and [[literature]]. As the project had been extended from a sole database to a platform for historiographical research, it was presented at the conference ''Using the World Wide Web for Historical Research in Science and Technology'' organized by the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] at [[Stanford University]]. In 2000, the project was incorporated into the research project ''The Experimentalization of Life'', funded by the Volkswagen Foundation. This was followed by another presentation at the conference ''Virtual Research? The impact of new technologies on scientific practices'' at the [[ETH Zurich]]. In 2002, the first version of the Virtual Laboratory went online. Since 2008, the Virtual Laboratory is listed as a journal under the [[ISSN]] number 1866-4784.

==Structure==
The Virtual Laboratory consists of two parts: The '''archive''' holds a large number of [[digitized]] texts and images as well as data sheets compiled from these resources, the '''laboratory''' holds historiographical work on the experimentalization of life as well as a working environment to enable new ways of writing history.
The Virtual Laboratory is composed of 8 sections:
*'''Essays''': this section holds the historiographical papers that are in turn linked to the source material of the archive.  
*'''Experiments''': contains data sheets on classical experiments from 19th century life sciences, e.g. on blood circulation, muscle contraction, verve conduction and reaction time.
*'''Technology''': deals with the technological aspects of experimentalization, hence the instruments.
*'''Objects''': this section is still under construction. It will contain the actual objects of the experiments, hence organisms.
*'''Sites''': contains data sheets on institutions at which experimental work was conducted.
*'''People''': this sections holds short biographies of the protagonists of experimentalization.
*'''Concepts''': is dedicated to central concepts like reflex, function and consciousness and their respective histories.
*'''Library''': this is the core section of the Virtual Laboratory. Besides digitized texts, journals and trade catalogues, it holds manuscripts, audio files and excerpts of movies. The printed texts are in the process of being ocr-ed and are already partly accessible via fulltext search.
All materials are available as pdf downloads.

Apart from these thematical sections, ''tools'' and ''myLab'' offer the possibility to use the Virtual Laboratory as a research environment. It is possible to create specific collections from the available materials, work on them and share them with other users.

{{redirect|Write-in ballot|mail-in ballot|Postal voting}}
A '''write-in candidate''' is a candidate in an election whose name does not appear on the [[ballot]], but for whom voters may [[vote]] nonetheless by writing in the person's name. The system is almost totally confined to elections in the United States. Some [[U.S. state]]s and local jurisdictions allow a voter to affix a sticker, with the write-in candidate's name, to the ballot in lieu of actually writing in the candidate's name. Write-in candidacies are sometimes a result of a candidate being legally or procedurally ineligible to run under his or her own name or party; write-in candidacies may be permitted where term limits bar an incumbent candidate from being officially nominated for, or being listed on the ballot for, re-election. In some cases, write-in campaigns have been organized to support a candidate who is not personally involved in running; this may be a form of [[draft (politics)|draft]] campaign.

Write-in candidates rarely win, and sometimes write-in votes are cast for ineligible people or fictional characters. Some jurisdictions require write-in candidates be registered as official candidates before the election.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Section 1-4-1101, Colorado Revised Statutes (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; This is standard in elections with a large pool of potential candidates, as there may be multiple candidates with the same name that could be written in.

Many U.S. states and municipalities allow for write-in votes in a partisan [[primary election]] where no candidate is listed on the ballot to have the same functional effect as nominating petitions: for example, if there are no [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] members on the ballot for state general assembly and a candidate receives more than 200 write-in votes when the primary election is held (or the other number of signatures that were required for ballot access), the candidate will be placed on the ballot on that ballot line for the general election. In most places, this provision is in place for non-partisan elections as well.

==Contrast from a blank ballot election system==
The term "write-in candidate" is used in elections in which names of candidates or parties are '''preprinted''' on a paper ballot or displayed on an electronic voting machine. The term is not generally used in elections in which all ballots are blank and thus all voters must write in the names of their preferred candidates. Blank ballot election systems reduce the cost of printing the ballots, but increase the complexity of casting and counting votes. Such systems are [[elections in Japan|used in Japan]],&lt;ref name="Cox2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cox|first=Karen E.|first2=Leonard J. |last2=Schoppa|year=2016|title=Interaction Effects in Mixed-Member Electoral Systems|journal=Comparative Political Studies |quote=Japanese voters receive a blank ballot paper and are instructed to write down the name of an SMD candidate after examining a sheet posted on the wall of their voting booth.

==United States==

===Historical success of write-in candidates===
Generally, write-in candidates can compete in any election within the United States. Typically, write-in candidates have a very small chance of winning, but there have been some strong showings by write-in candidates over the years.

====Presidential primaries====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
*In 1928, [[Herbert Hoover]] won the Republican Massachusetts presidential primary on write-ins, polling 100,279.
*In 1940, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] won the Democratic New Jersey presidential primary with 34,278 write-ins.
*In 1944, [[Thomas Dewey]] won the Republican Pennsylvania presidential primary with 146,706 write-ins.
*In 1948, [[Harold Stassen]] won the Republican Pennsylvania presidential primary with 81,242 write-ins.
*In 1952, [[Robert A. Taft]] won the Republican Nebraska presidential primary with 79,357 write-ins, [[Estes Kefauver]] won the Democratic Pennsylvania presidential primary with 93,160 write-ins and  [[Dwight Eisenhower]] won the Republican Massachusetts presidential primary with 254,898 write-ins.
*In 1956, [[Dwight Eisenhower]] won the Republican Massachusetts presidential primary with 51,951 write-ins.
*In 1960, [[Richard Nixon]] won the Republican Massachusetts presidential primary with 53,164 write-ins and [[John F. Kennedy]] won the Democratic Pennsylvania presidential primary with 183,073 write-ins along with the Democratic Massachusetts presidential primary with 91,607 write-ins.
*In 1964, a write-in campaign organized by supporters of former U.S. Senator and vice presidential nominee [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] won Republican primaries for President in [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Massachusetts]], defeating declared candidates [[Barry Goldwater]], [[Nelson Rockefeller]], and [[Margaret Chase Smith]].
*In 1968 in the Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, incumbent President [[Lyndon Johnson]] did not file, but received write-ins totaling 50% of all Democratic votes cast. Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]], who campaigned actively against Johnson's [[Vietnam war]] policies, was on the ballot. He received an impressive 41% of the vote and gained more delegates than the President, who was reportedly "so stunned that [[United States presidential election, 1968#Johnson withdraws|he did not run for reelection]]".&lt;ref name="New Hampshire's First-In-The-Nation Presidential Primary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nh.gov/nhinfo/highlights.html|title=NH.gov – New Hampshire Almanac – First-in-the-Nation – Highlights|publisher=|accessdate=April 15, 2016|quote=Johnson was so stunned that he did not run for reelection.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1992, [[consumer activism|consumer advocate]] [[Ralph Nader]] ran a write-in campaign during the [[New Hampshire primary]] for the [[presidential nomination]] of both the Democratic and Republican parties. Declaring himself the "[[none of the above]] candidate" and using his [[Concord Principles]] as his platform, Nader received 3,054 votes from [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 3,258 votes from [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].

====Senate====
*Republican [[William Knowland]] was elected in 1946 to the U.S. Senate from California, for a two-month term. The special election for the two-month term featured a November ballot with no names printed on it, and all candidates in that special election were write-in candidates.&lt;ref name=WashPost-2010-11-03-Wilgoren-Murkowski&gt;Washington Post, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/03/AR2010110302555.html "Murkowski appears to make history in Alaska"], Debbi Wilgoren, November 3, 2010 (accessed November 3, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Democrat [[Strom Thurmond]] was [[South Carolina United States Senate election, 1954|elected in 1954]] to the [[United States Senate]] in [[South Carolina]] as a write-in candidate, after state Democratic leaders had blocked him from receiving the party's nomination.&lt;ref name=WashPost-2010-11-03-Wilgoren-Murkowski/&gt;
*In [[United States Senate election in Alaska, 2010|2010]] incumbent [[list of United States Senators from Alaska|Alaska Senator]] [[Lisa Murkowski]] lost the Republican primary to [[Joe Miller (Alaska politician)|Joe Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.alaska.gov/results/10PRIM/data/results.htm Official election results for the 2010 primaries]. Alaska Division of Elections.&lt;/ref&gt; Following her defeat she ran in the general election as a write-in candidate. Murkowski had filed, and won, a lawsuit requiring election officials to have the list of names of write-in candidates distributed at the polls,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/28/lisa-murkowski-can-appear_n_775221.html|work=Huffington Post|title=Lisa Murkowski Can Appear On List Of Write-In Candidates, State Supreme Court Rules|first=Dan|last=Joling|date=October 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently won the election with a wide enough margin over both Miller, and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate [[Scott T. McAdams]], to make moot [[Miller v. Campbell|the write-in ballots that had been challenged by Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/articles/2010/11/18/murkowski_becomes_1st_write_in_senator_since_54/|title=Murkowski becomes 1st write-in senator since '54|date=November 18, 2010|first=Becky|last=Bohrer|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====House of Representatives====
*In 1918, [[Peter F. Tague]] was elected to the U.S. House as a write-in independent Democrat, defeating the Democratic nominee, [[John F. Fitzgerald]].
*In 1930 Republican [[Charles F. Curry, Jr.]] was elected to the House as a write-in from Sacramento, California. His father, [[Congress of the United States|Congressman]] [[Charles F. Curry]] Sr., would have been listed on the ballot unopposed but, due to his untimely death, his name was removed and no candidate's name was listed on the ballot.
*In 1958, Democrat [[Dale Alford]] was elected as a write-in candidate to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in Arkansas. As member of the [[Little Rock School District|Little Rock school board]], Alford launched his write-in campaign a week before the election because the incumbent, [[Brooks Hays]], was involved in the incident in which [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|president Eisenhower]] sent federal troops to enforce [[racial integration]] at [[Central High School (Little Rock)|Little Rock Central High School]]. Racial integration was unpopular at the time, and Alford won by approximately 1,200 votes, a 2% margin.&lt;ref name=Rudin&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5698889|title=What Happens If Lieberman Wins|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|author=Ken Rudin|date=August 23, 2006|accessdate=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1964 Democrat [[Gale Schisler]] was nominated for Congress in Illinois as a write-in candidate when no Democrat filed to run in the primary election. He defeated incumbent [[Robert McLoskey]] in the November General Election.
*In November 1980, Republican [[Joe Skeen]] was elected to Congress in New Mexico as a write-in candidate, because of a [[spoiler candidate]] who also happened to be a write-in. No Republican had filed to run against the incumbent Democrat, [[Harold L. Runnels]], before the close of filing. Runnels died on August 5, 1980, and the Democrats requested a special primary to pick a replacement candidate. The New Mexico Secretary of State allowed the Democrats to have a special primary, but did not allow the Republicans to have a special primary, because they had already gone with no candidate. So Skeen ran as a write-in candidate. After Runnels' widow lost the Democratic special primary, she launched her own write-in candidacy, which [[vote splitting|split the Democratic vote]], taking enough votes from the Democratic nominee to [[spoiler effect|give the election]] to the Republican, Skeen, who won with a 38% [[plurality (voting)|plurality]].&lt;ref name=Rudin/&gt;
*[[Ron Packard]] of California finished in second place in the 18-candidate Republican primary to replace the retiring [[Clair Burgener]]. Packard lost the primary by 92 votes in 1982, and then mounted a write-in campaign as an independent. He won the election with a 37% [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] against both a Republican and a Democratic candidate. Following the elections, he re-aligned himself as a Republican.&lt;ref name=Rudin/&gt;
*Democrat [[Charlie Wilson (Ohio politician)|Charlie Wilson]] was the endorsed candidate of the Democratic Party for [[Ohio's 6th congressional district]] in Ohio to replace [[Ted Strickland]] in 2006. Strickland was running for Governor, and had to give up his congressional seat. Wilson, though, did not qualify for the ballot because only 46 of the 96 signatures on his candidacy petition were deemed valid, while 50 valid signatures were required for ballot placement. The Democratic Party continued to support Wilson, and an expensive primary campaign ensued – over $1 million was spent by both parties. Wilson overwhelmingly won the Democratic primary as a write-in candidate on May 2, 2006 against two Democratic candidates whose names were on the ballot, with Wilson collecting 44,367 votes, 67% of the Democratic votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.columbusdispatch.com/news-story.php?story=183395|title=Wilson wins primary as write-in candidate|publisher=The Columbus Dispatch|first=Alan|last=Johnson|date=May 3, 2006|accessdate=2006-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson faced [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] Chuck Blasdel in the general election on November 7, 2006, and won, receiving 61% of the votes.
*Democrat [[Dave Loebsack]] entered the 2006 Democratic primary in Iowa's second congressional district as a write-in candidate after failing to get the required number of signatures. He won the primary and in the general election he defeated 15-term incumbent [[Jim Leach]] by a 51% to 49% margin.
*[[Jerry McNerney]] ran as a write-in candidate in the March 2004 Democratic Primary in [[California's 11th congressional district]]. He received 1,667 votes (3% of the votes cast), and, having no opposition (no candidates were listed on the Democratic primary ballot), won the primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2004_primary/congress.pdf|format=PDF|title=Election Results for the March 2004 Primary|publisher=[[Secretary of State of California|California Secretary of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he lost the November 2004 general election to Republican [[Richard Pombo]], McNerney ran again in 2006 (as a candidate listed on the ballot) and won the Democratic Primary in June, and then the rematch against Pombo in November.
*[[Shelley Sekula-Gibbs]] failed as a write-in candidate in the November 7, 2006 election to represent the 22nd Texas congressional district in the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]] (for the full term commencing January 3, 2007). The seat had been vacant since June 9, 2006, due to the resignation of the then representative [[Tom DeLay]]. Therefore, on the same ballot, there were two races: one for the 110th Congress, as well as a race for the unexpired portion of the term during the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]] (until January 3, 2007). Sekula-Gibbs won the race for the unexpired portion of the term during the 109th Congress as a candidate listed on the ballot. She could not be listed on the ballot for the full term because Texas law did not allow a replacement candidate to be listed on the ballot after the winner of the primary (Tom DeLay) has resigned.
*[[Peter Welch]], a Democrat representing [[Vermont]]'s sole congressional district, became both the Democratic and Republican nominee for the House when he ran for re-election in 2008 and 2016. Because the Republicans did not field any candidate on the primary ballot in those elections, Welch won enough write-in votes to win the Republican nomination.&lt;ref name="VT Times Agnus"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sanders-loving Vermont lawmaker snags GOP nomination|date=October 7, 2016|first=Heather|last=Caygle|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/peter-welch-vermont-democrat-republican-229251|publisher=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State legislatures====
*Several members of the [[Alaska House of Representatives]] were elected as write-in candidates during the 1960s and 1970s, particularly from [[The Bush (Alaska)|rural districts]] in the [[Far North Alaska|northern and western portions of the state]]. Factors in play at the time include the newness of Alaska as a state and the previous absence of electoral politics in many of the rural communities, creating an environment which made it hard to attract candidates to file for office during the official filing period. Most of the areas in question were largely populated by [[Alaska natives]], who held little political power in Alaska at the time. This only began to change following the formation of the [[Alaska Federation of Natives]] and the passage of the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]]. Known examples of successful write-in candidates include Kenneth A. Garrison and [[Society of Jesus|Father]] [[Segundo Llorente]] (1960), Frank R. Ferguson (1972), James H. "Jimmy" Huntington (1974), and Nels A. Anderson, Jr. (1976). The incumbent in Llorente's election, Axel C. Johnson, ran for re-election as a write-in candidate after failing to formally file his candidacy paperwork. Johnson and Llorente, as write-in candidates, both outpolled the one candidate who did appear on the ballot. Ferguson and Anderson were both incumbents who launched their write-in campaigns after being defeated in the [[primary election]]. Anderson's main opponent, Joseph McGill, had himself won election to the House in 1970 against a write-in candidate by only 5 votes.
*[[Carl Hawkinson]] of [[Galesburg, Illinois]] won the Republican primary for the [[Illinois Senate]] from Illinois's 47th District in 1986 as a write-in candidate. He went on to be elected in the general election and served until 2003. Hawkinson defeated another write-in, David Leitch, in the primary.

*[[Charlotte Burks]] won as a Democratic write-in candidate for the [[Tennessee Senate]] seat left vacant when the incumbent, her husband [[Tommy Burks|Tommy]], was assassinated by his opponent, [[Byron Looper]], two weeks before the elections of November 2, 1998. The assassin was the only name on the ballot, so Charlotte ran as a write-in candidate.
*[[Winnie Brinks]] was elected to the [[Michigan House of Representatives]] in 2012 after a series of unusual events. In May of that year, State Representative Roy Schmidt – who had previously filed to run for re-election as a Democrat – withdrew from the Democratic primary and re-filed as a Republican. A friend of Schmidt's nephew filed to run as a Democrat, but withdrew two days later amid anger among local Democrats. This left Democrats without a candidate. Brinks ran as a write-in to be the Democratic nominee. She won the primary and was listed on the ballot in the general election, which she also won. Coincidentally, the general election also saw a write-in candidate, Bing Goei, receive significant support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2012/12/winnie_brinks.html|title=Winnie Brinks takes oath of office as Michigan's 76th District State Representative|work=MLive.com|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===California's Proposition 14 impact on write-in candidates===
In 2010, California voters passed [[California Proposition 14 (2010)|Proposition 14]] which set up a new election system for the [[United States Senate]], [[United States House of Representatives]], all statewide offices ([[Governor of California|governor]], [[Lieutenant Governor of California|lieutenant governor]], [[Secretary of State of California|secretary of state]], [[California State Treasurer|state treasurer]], [[California State Controller|state controller]], [[California Attorney General|attorney general]], [[California Insurance Commissioner|insurance commissioner]], and [[California State Superintendent of Public Instruction|superintendent of public instruction]]), [[California Board of Equalization]], and for the [[California State Legislature]]. In the system set up by Proposition 14, there are two rounds of voting, and the top two vote-getters for each race in the first round (the primary, normally held in June) advance to a second round (the general election, held in November). Proposition 14 specifically prohibits write-in candidates in the second round, and this prohibition was upheld in a court challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.findlaw.com/california_case_law/2011/09/court-upholds-prop-14-bans-on-write-in-votes-unqualified-parties.html|title=Court Upholds Prop 14 Bans on Write-In Votes, Unqualified Parties|first=Robyn|last=Hagan Cain|date=Sep 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another court challenge to the prohibition on write-in candidates in the second round was filed in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2014/07/30/6594480/lawsuit-challenges-write-in-rules.html|title=Lawsuit challenges write-in rules under California's top-two system|date=Jul 30, 2014|first=Christopher|last=Cadelago|publisher=[[Sacramento Bee]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Proposition 14 prohibits write-in candidates in the second round of voting, it has made it easier for write-in candidates in the first round to advance to the second round. This generally happens in elections where only one candidate is listed on the ballot. Since in each race the top two vote-getters from the first round are guaranteed to advance to the second round, if only one candidate is listed on the ballot, a write-in candidate can easily advance to the second round, as the write-in candidate would only have to compete with other write-in candidates for the 2nd spot, not with any listed candidates. In some [[jungle primary]] systems, if the winner in the first round wins by more than 50% of the vote, then the second (runoff) round gets cancelled, but in the system set up by Proposition 14, a second (runoff) round is required regardless of the percent of the vote that the winner of the first round received. Proposition 14 therefore guarantees that if one candidate is listed on the ballot in the first round, a write-in candidate running against the one listed candidate can earn a spot for the second round with as little as one vote.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;In the June 2012 election, a write-in candidate running in the [[California's 33rd State Senate district|33rd Senate District]] won a spot in the runoff race with as few as 3 votes. See [http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/prior-elections/statewide-election-results/presidential-primary-election-june-5-2012/statement-vote/ official election results]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first election in which Proposition 14 went into effect was the [[California elections, June 2012|2012 elections]].

Another impact of Proposition 14 on write-in candidates is that since Proposition 14, candidates who are not affiliated with any party can be listed on the ballot for election to offices affected by Proposition 14. Prior to passage of Proposition 14, candidates who were not affiliated with any party, could not run in any party primaries, and were required to run in the general election as write-in candidates.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

With a few exceptions, the practice of recognizing write-in candidates is typically viewed internationally as an [[politics of the United States|American]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/WolfFiles/story?id=91051&amp;page=1|title=Donald Duck's a Big Bird in Politics|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/212163.stm |work=BBC News |title=Livingstone threatens write-in campaign |date=November 11, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Several cases of elected write-in candidates occurred in the 2006 Swedish municipal elections. Under Swedish electoral law, free ballots are provided for any party that received more than 1 percent of the votes in one of the two latest parliamentary elections, irrespective of whether the party actually stood any candidates in the municipality. In some municipalities, voters cast a sufficient number of ballots for the nationalist [[Sweden Democrats]] to allow them to get a seat on the municipal council. (The membership of municipal councils in Sweden is relatively large, with even the smallest municipalities, numbering just a few thousand inhabitants, required to have a council of at least 31 members.) In cases where a party did not field any eligible candidates, people whose names were written in were elected, though many subsequently resigned their seats. In places where no candidates were written in, the seats were left vacant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://expressen.se/1.428456|title=Skämtet gjorde Jonas till sd-politiker|work=Expressen|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A bizarre incident involving a fictitious write-in candidacy occurred in the small town of [[Picoazá]], Ecuador in 1967. A company ran a series of campaign-themed advertisements for a foot powder called Pulvapies. Some of the slogans used included "Vote for any candidate, but if you want well-being and hygiene, vote for Pulvapies", and "For Mayor: Honorable Pulvapies". The foot powder Pulvapies ended up receiving the most votes in the election.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1967/07/18/archives/foot-powder-produces-headaches-in-ecuador.html Foot Powder Produces Headaches in Ecuador]."

*In Brazil, until the introduction of [[electronic voting]] in 1994, the ballot had no names written for [[legislative]] candidates, so many voters would protest by voting on fictional characters or religious figures. In a famous case, the [[São Paulo Zoo|São Paulo city zoo]] rhinoceros ''[[Cacareco]]'' got around 100,000 votes in the 1959 elections for the [[Municipal Chamber of São Paulo|municipal council]], more than any candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ferreira|first=Neil|title=Cacareco agora é Excelência|url=http://www.memoriaviva.com.br/ocruzeiro/24101959/241059_8.htm|work=O Cruzeiro|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, those votes were not considered because Brazilian law stipulates that a candidate must be affiliated to a political party to take office.

==Protest==
*[[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'' magazine]] satirically called to vote for [[Alfred E. Neuman]] as a write-in candidate for every U.S. presidential election from 1960 to 1980 with slogans like "You could do worse–and you already have" and "There are Bigger Idiots running for office!".
*In the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 U.S. Presidential election]], guitarist [[Joe Walsh]] ran a mock write-in campaign, promising to make his song "[[Life's Been Good]]" the new national anthem if he won, and running on a platform of "Free Gas for Everyone." Though Walsh (then aged 33) was not old enough to actually assume the office, he wanted to raise public awareness of the election. (In 1992, Walsh purportedly ran for ''vice''-president, in his song "Vote For Me", a track on his album ''[[Songs for a Dying Planet]]'', which was released that year.)
*During the 2000 [[United States Congress#Elections|United States Congress Elections]], film-maker [[Michael Moore]] led a campaign for voters to submit a [[ficus]] tree as a write-in candidate. This campaign was replicated across the country and was recounted in an episode of ''[[The Awful Truth (TV show)|The Awful Truth]]''.
*In 2012, a campaign was waged to write in [[Charles Darwin]] against Georgia congressman [[Paul Broun]] (who was running unopposed) after Broun "called evolution and other areas of science 'lies straight from the pit of hell.' " Darwin received approximately 4,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://onlineathens.com/election/2012-11-08/charles-darwin-gets-nearly-4000-write-votes-athens-against-rep-broun|title=Charles Darwin gets 4,000 write-in votes in Athens against Paul Broun|date=November 9, 2012|first=Jim|last=Thompson|publisher=[[Athens Banner-Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because Darwin was not registered as an official candidate (some states require even write-ins to be pre-registered), the [[Georgia Secretary of State]] did not tabulate those votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/GA/42277/113204/en/summary.html|title=GA – Election Results|publisher=|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2016, several grassroots campaigns to elect [[Bernie Sanders]] President as a write-in candidate were established on social media in the run-up to the United States presidential election. Though Sanders continued to campaign for Democrat nominee [[Hillary Clinton]], supporters pointed to alleged DNC bias in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|Democratic Party's presidential primaries]] against Sanders, and Clinton's email scandal, and continued to support him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article112114202.html|title=Latest Hillary Clinton drama gives Bernie Sanders' write-in campaign a boost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Clinton and [[Donald Trump]] would have had to win less than the required 270 electoral college votes for Sanders to have denied either candidate the presidency, and for the election to be passed to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] – thus the initial write-in campaign around Vermont, offering only three college votes, was not successful, but Sanders did receive almost six percent of the vote there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theindependentthinker2016.wordpress.com/2016/09/24/how-bernie-sanders-could-become-president-with-only-130000-votes/|title=How Bernie Sanders Could Become President With Only 130,000 Votes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign expanded to include all 12 eligible states (one of which listed Sanders as an official write-in candidate), and relied on states such as California, with a high electoral college vote count and large support for Sanders, to be successful in denying both Trump and Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/3666716/over-18-million-people-in-california-can-write-in-bernie-sanders-in-california-almost-no-media-reporting-it/|title=Over 18 Million People In California Could Write-In Bernie Sanders In California, Almost No Media Reporting It}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Sweden, all handwritten votes are [[Optical character recognition|scanned by computer]] and the results published online, although only votes for valid parties count towards determining successful candidates. In the [[Swedish general election, 2010|2010 general election]], ineffective votes included 120 for [[Donald Duck]] and 2 for "myself",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/sweden/8021258/Donald-Duck-and-God-mar-Swedish-election.html|title=Donald Duck and God mar Swedish election|date=23 Sep 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as several computer code snippets apparently intended as [[code injection]] attacks aimed at either the program which tallied the votes or the browsers of users who accessed the results website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sweden-election-hack|title=Hacking Sweden's election with pen and paper|last=Geere|first=Duncan|date=24 September 2010|work=[[Wired UK]]|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Charles R. Doty]], a five-time unsuccessful write-in candidate for U.S. president, appeared on ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' five times.
*In the fourth season of ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', despite being pressured to pull out of the [[Star City (comics)|Star City]] mayoral race by [[Damien Darhk]], [[Oliver Queen (Arrow)|Oliver Queen]] still receives 48% of the votes due to his supporters writing him in.{{episode needed|date=October 2016}}
*In the second season of [[Metalocalypse]], [[Dethklok]] vocalist Nathan Explosion is elected governor of [[Florida]] in a landslide write-in victory after the previous governor was murdered by a mob of angry Dethklok fans for refusing to give Explosion a state holiday.

'''Writeprint''' is a method in [[forensic linguistics]] of establishing author identification over the internet, likened to a digital fingerprint.  Identity is established through a comparison of distinguishing [[stylometry|stylometric]] characteristics of an unknown written text with known samples of the suspected author ([[writer invariant]]s).  Even without a suspect, writeprint provides potential background characteristics of the author, such as nationality and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Jiexun|last2=Zheng|first2=Rong|last3=Chen|first3=Hsinchun|title=From Fingerprint to Writeprint|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=April 2006|volume=49|issue=4|pages=76–82|doi=10.1145/1121949.1121951|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1121951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five broad aspects to author identification in writeprint:  
:*lexical features- The analysis of the [[lexicon]], the author's choice of vocabulary.  
:*syntactic features- The analysis of the author's writing style and sentence structure, such as: punctuation, use of passive voice, and sentence complexity.
:*structural features- The analysis of the author's organization of the work.  These include paragraph length, spacing, and indentation.  
:*content-specific features- The analysis of the language that is contextually significant to subject of the written work.  Examples include the use of slang or acronyms that are specific to a crime like pirating software or hacking.
:*idiosyncratic features- The analysis of errors and other ungrammatical elements that may be unique to the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbasi|first1=Ahmed|last2=Chen|first2=Hsinchun|last3=Nunamaker Jr.|first3=Jay F.|title=Stylometric Identification in Electronic Markets: Scalability and Robustness|journal=Journal of Management Information System|date=Summer 2008|volume=25|issue=1|pages=49–78|jstor=40398926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the five features above are the traditional methods of author identification, there are features unique to online text. Features such as choice in font, the use of emojis, and links to other websites all provide a path to identification which is absent in traditional text analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rehmeyer|first1=Juli|title=Digital Fingerprints|journal=Science News|date=Jan 13, 2007|volume=171|issue=2|pages=26–28|jstor=3982506}}&lt;/ref&gt;
