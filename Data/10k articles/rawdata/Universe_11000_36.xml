'''Asphalt''', also known as '''bitumen''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|b|ɪ|tj|ʊ|m|ɪ|n}}, {{IPAc-en|us|b|ɪ|ˈ|tj|uː|m|ə|n|,_|b|aɪ|-}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EPD|18}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a sticky, black, and highly [[viscosity|viscous]] liquid or semi-solid form of [[petroleum]]. It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product, and is classed as a [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]]. Before the 20th century, the term '''asphaltum''' was also used.&lt;ref name="Abraham1938"&gt;{{cite book|first=Herbert|last=Abraham|year=1938| title=Asphalts and Allied Substances: Their Occurrence, Modes of Production, Uses in the Arts, and Methods of Testing | edition=4th| publisher=D.

The primary use (70%) of asphalt is in [[Road_surface|road construction]], where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] particles to create [[asphalt concrete]]. Its other main uses are for [[bituminous waterproofing]] products, including production of [[roofing felt]] and for sealing flat roofs.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1002/14356007.a03_169.pub2|chapter=Asphalt and Bitumen|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2009|last1=Sörensen|first1=Anja|last2=Wichert|first2=Bodo|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "asphalt" and "bitumen" are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance. In [[American English]], "asphalt" (or "asphalt cement") is commonly used for a refined residue from the [[distillation]] process of selected crude oils. Outside the United States, the product is often called "bitumen", and geologists worldwide often prefer the term for the naturally occurring variety. Common colloquial usage often refers to various forms of asphalt as "[[tar]]", as in the name of the [[La Brea Tar Pits]].

Naturally occurring asphalt is sometimes specified by the term "crude bitumen". Its viscosity is similar to that of cold [[molasses]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oil Sands – Glossary  |work=Oil Sands Royalty Guidelines  |publisher=Government of Alberta  |year=2008  |url=http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/OilSands/1106.asp  |accessdate=2 February 2008  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101112113/http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/OilSands/1106.asp  |archivedate=1 November 2007 |deadurl=no  |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Walker |first=Ian C. |title=Marketing Challenges for Canadian Bitumen |place=Tulsa, OK |publisher=International Centre for Heavy Hydrocarbons |year=1998 |url=http://www.oildrop.org/Info/Centre/Lib/7thConf/19980101.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313084908/http://www.oildrop.org/Info/Centre/Lib/7thConf/19980101.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-03-13 |format=PDF |quote=Bitumen has been defined by various sources as crude oil with a dynamic viscosity at reservoir conditions of more than 10,000 centipoise.

== Terminology ==

=== Etymology ===
The word "asphalt" is derived from the late Middle English, in turn from French ''asphalte'', based on [[Late Latin]] ''asphalton'', ''asphaltum'', which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἄσφαλτος (''ásphaltos'', ''ásphalton''), a word meaning "asphalt/bitumen/[[Pitch (resin)|pitch]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Fsfaltos ἄσφαλτος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which perhaps derives from ἀ-, "without" and σφάλλω (''sfallō''), "make fall".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfa%2Fllw σφάλλω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects, and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application. Specifically, [[Herodotus]] mentioned that bitumen was brought to Babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+1.179.4&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 1.179.4], on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; From the Greek, the word passed into late Latin, and thence into French (''asphalte'') and English ("asphaltum" and "asphalt"). In French, the term ''asphalte'' is used for naturally occurring asphalt-soaked limestone deposits, and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the "asphaltic concrete" used to pave roads.

The expression "bitumen" originated in the [[Sanskrit]] words ''jatu'', meaning "pitch", and ''jatu-krit'', meaning "pitch creating" or "pitch producing" (referring to [[coniferous]] or resinous trees). The Latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally ''gwitu-men'' (pertaining to pitch), and by others, ''pixtumens'' (exuding or bubbling pitch), which was subsequently shortened to ''bitumen'', thence passing via French into English. From the same root is derived the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] word ''cwidu'' (mastix), the German word ''Kitt'' (cement or mastic) and the old Norse word ''kvada''.&lt;ref name="Abraham19381"&gt;Abraham, Herbert (1938), p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern terminology ===
In [[British English]], "bitumen" is used instead of "asphalt". The word "asphalt" is instead used to refer to [[asphalt concrete]], a mixture of [[construction aggregate]] and asphalt itself (also called "tarmac" in common parlance). Bitumen mixed with clay was usually called "asphaltum", but the term is less commonly used today.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In [[Australian English]], the word "asphalt" is used to describe a mix of [[construction aggregate]]. "Bitumen" refers to the liquid derived from the heavy-residues from crude oil distillation.

In [[American English]], "asphalt" is equivalent to the British "bitumen". However, "asphalt" is also commonly used as a shortened form of "[[asphalt concrete]]" (therefore equivalent to the British "asphalt" or "tarmac").

In [[Canadian English]], the word "bitumen" is used to refer to the vast Canadian deposits of extremely heavy [[crude oil]],&lt;ref name="oilsands"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/OilSands/793.asp|title=What is Oil Sands|year=2007|publisher=Alberta Energy|accessdate=10 January 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205055523/http://www.qrpoil.com/site/?bitumen|archivedate=5 February 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while "asphalt" is used for the oil refinery product. Diluted bitumen (diluted with [[naphtha]] to make it flow in pipelines) is known as "[[dilbit]]" in the Canadian petroleum industry, while bitumen "[[Upgrader|upgraded]]" to [[synthetic crude]] oil is known as "syncrude", and syncrude blended with bitumen is called "synbit".&lt;ref name="CAPP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capp.ca/default.asp?V_DOC_ID=1220|title=2007 Canadian Crude Oil Forecast and Market Outlook|date=June 2007|publisher=Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers|accessdate=30 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226022714/http://membernet.capp.ca/default.asp?V_DOC_ID=1220|archivedate=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bitumen" is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi-solid form of petroleum. "Bituminous rock" is a form of [[sandstone]] impregnated with bitumen. The [[oil sands]] of [[Alberta, Canada]] are a similar material.

Neither of the terms "asphalt" or "bitumen" should be confused with [[tar]] or [[coal tars]].{{elucidate|date=June 2017}}

== Composition ==
{{see also|Asphaltene}}

=== Normal composition ===
The components of asphalt include four main classes of compounds: 
* Naphthene aromatics ([[naphthalene]]), consisting of partially hydrogenated polycyclic aromatic compounds
* Polar aromatics, consisting of high [[molecular weight]] [[phenols]] and [[carboxylic acid]]s produced by partial oxidation of the material
* [[Saturated hydrocarbons]]; the percentage of saturated compounds in asphalt correlates with its softening point
* Asphaltenes, consisting of high molecular weight phenols and [[heterocyclic compound]]s

The naphthene aromatics and polar aromatics are typically the majority components. Most natural bitumens also contain [[organosulfur compound]]s, resulting in an overall sulfur content of up to 4%.

The substance is soluble in [[carbon disulfide]]. It is commonly modelled as a [[colloid]], with [[asphaltene]]s as the dispersed phase and [[wikt:maltene|maltenes]] as the continuous phase.&lt;ref name="Quddus"&gt;{{cite book|author=Muhammad Abdul Quddus|year=1992|title=Thesis submitted to Department of Applied Chemistry; University of Karachi|chapter=Catalytic Oxidation of Asphalt|publisher=Higher Education Commission Pakistan: Pakistan Research Repository|location=Pakistan|page=6, in ch.2 pdf|chapter-url=http://eprints.hec.gov.pk/1171/1/891.html.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205060447/http://eprints.hec.gov.pk/1171/1/891.html.htm|archivedate=5 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It is almost impossible to separate and identify all the different molecules of asphalt, because the number of molecules with different chemical structure is extremely large".&lt;ref name="Quddus99"&gt;Muhammad Abdul Quddus (1992), p.99, in ch.5 pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Asphalt may be confused with [[coal tar]], which is a visually similar black, thermoplastic material produced by the [[destructive distillation]] of [[coal]]. During the early and mid-20th century, when [[town gas]] was produced, coal tar was a readily available byproduct and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates. The addition of coal tar to [[macadam]] roads led to the word "[[Tarmacadam|tarmac]]", which is now used in common parlance to refer to road-making materials. However, since the 1970s, when natural gas succeeded town gas, asphalt has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications. Other examples of this confusion include the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] and the Canadian [[oil sands]], both of which actually contain natural bitumen rather than tar. "Pitch" is another term sometimes informally used at times to refer to asphalt, as in [[Pitch Lake]].

===Additives, mixtures and contaminants===
For economic and other reasons, asphalt is sometimes sold combined with other materials, often without being labeled as anything other than simply "asphalt".&lt;ref name="whats_in_your_asphalt_2017_09_fhwa"&gt;Arnold, Terence S. (senior research chemist, Pavement Materials Team, Office of Infrastructure Research and Development, [[Federal Highway Administration]]; Federal lab manager for the chemistry lab, [[Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center]]; fellow of the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] in the [[United Kingdom]]), [https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/17sept/03.cfm "What's in Your Asphalt?,"] September 2017 (last modified October 25, 2017), ''Public Roads,'' FHWA-HRT-17-006.htm,"   Office of Research, Development, and Technology, Office of Corporate Research, Technology, and Innovation Management, [[Federal Highway Administration]], [[U.S. Department of Transportation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular note, in the 21st century, is the use of [[Automotive oil recycling#REOB|re-refined engine oil bottoms -- "REOB" or "REOBs"]]—the residue of [[Automotive oil recycling|recycled autmotive engine oil]], collected from the bottoms of re-refining [[vacuum distillation]] towers. It contains the various non-refined elements and compounds in recycled engine oil, leftover from the re-refining process—both additives to the original oil, and materials accumulating from its circulation in the engine (typically [[iron]] and [[copper]]).  Some research has indicated a correlation between this contamination of asphalt and poorer-performing pavement.&lt;ref name="whats_in_your_asphalt_2017_09_fhwa" /&gt;

==Occurrence==
[[File:Puy de Poix, gisement bitumeux.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Bituminous outcrop of the Puy de la Poix, [[Clermont-Ferrand]], France]]
The majority of asphalt used commercially is obtained from petroleum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Speight|first=James G.|title=Asphalt Materials Science and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PtMVBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82|year=2015|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-12-800501-9|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, large amounts of asphalt occur in concentrated form in nature. Naturally occurring deposits of bitumen are formed from the remains of ancient, microscopic [[algae]] ([[diatom]]s) and other once-living things. These remains were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the ocean or lake where the organisms lived. Under the heat (above 50&amp;nbsp;°C) and [[pressure]] of burial deep in the earth, the remains were transformed into materials such as bitumen, [[kerogen]], or petroleum.

Natural deposits of bitumen include lakes such as the [[Pitch Lake]] in Trinidad and Tobago and [[Lake Bermudez]] in [[Venezuela]]. Natural [[petroleum seep|seeps]] occur in the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] and in the [[Dead Sea]].

Bitumen also occurs in unconsolidated sandstones known as "oil sands" in [[Alberta]], Canada, and the similar "tar sands" in [[Utah]], US.
The Canadian province of [[Alberta]] has most of the world's reserves, in three huge deposits covering {{convert|142000|km2}}, an area larger than [[England]] or [[New York state]]. These bituminous sands contain {{convert|166|Goilbbl}} of commercially established oil reserves, giving Canada the third largest [[oil reserves]] in the world. Although historically it was used without refining to pave roads, nearly all of the output is now used as [[raw material]] for [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]] in Canada and the United States.&lt;ref name="ST98"/&gt;

The world's largest deposit of natural bitumen, known as the [[Athabasca oil sands]], is located in the [[McMurray Formation]] of Northern Alberta. This formation is from the early [[Cretaceous]], and is composed of numerous [[lens (geology)|lenses]] of oil-bearing sand with up to 20% oil.&lt;ref name=bunger&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bunger | first1 = J. | last2 = Thomas | first2 = K. | last3 = Dorrence | first3 = S. | year = 1979 | title = Compound types and properties of Utah and Athabasca tar sand bitumens | url = | journal = Fuel | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 183–195 | doi=10.1016/0016-2361(79)90116-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isotopic studies show the oil deposits to be about 110 million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Selby | first1 = D. | last2 = Creaser | first2 = R. | year = 2005 | title = Direct radiometric dating of hydrocarbon deposits using rhenium-osmium isotopes | url = | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5726| pages = 1293–1295 | doi=10.1126/science.1111081 | pmid=15919988| bibcode = 2005Sci...308.1293S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two smaller but still very large formations occur in the [[Peace River oil sands]] and the [[Cold Lake oil sands]], to the west and southeast of the Athabasca oil sands, respectively. Of the Alberta deposits, only parts of the Athabasca oil sands are shallow enough to be suitable for surface mining. The other 80% has to be produced by oil wells using [[enhanced oil recovery]] techniques like [[steam-assisted gravity drainage]].&lt;ref name=oilsandfacts&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts about Alberta’s oil sands and its industry |publisher=Oil Sands Discovery Centre |url=http://history.alberta.ca/oilsands/resources/docs/facts_sheets09.pdf |accessdate=19 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123024928/http://history.alberta.ca/oilsands/resources/docs/facts_sheets09.pdf |archivedate=23 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much smaller heavy oil or bitumen deposits also occur in the [[Uinta Basin]] in Utah, US.  The [[Tar Sand Triangle]] deposit, for example, is roughly 6% bitumen.&lt;ref name=bunger /&gt;

Bitumen may occur in [[hydrothermal vein]]s. An example of this is within the [[Uinta Basin]] of [[Utah]], in the US, where there is a swarm of laterally and vertically extensive veins composed of a solid hydrocarbon termed [[Gilsonite]]. These veins formed by the polymerization and solidification of hydrocarbons that were mobilized from the deeper oil shales of the [[Green River Formation]] during burial and [[diagenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=T. Boden and B. Tripp |title=Gilsonite veins of the Uinta Basin, Utah |publisher=Utah Geological Survey, Special Study 141 |location=Utah, US |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bitumen is similar to the organic matter in carbonaceous [[meteorite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hayatsu | display-authors = etal | year = | title =none | url = | journal = Meteoritics | volume = 18 | issue = | page = 310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, detailed studies have shown these materials to be distinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 =  | last2 = Yang | year = | title =none | url = | journal = Journal of Astronomy and Space Sciences | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 163–174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast Alberta bitumen resources are considered to have started out as living material from marine plants and animals, mainly [[algae]], that died millions of years ago when an ancient ocean covered Alberta. They were covered by mud, buried deeply over time, and gently cooked into oil by geothermal heat at a temperature of {{convert|50|to|150|C|sigfig=2}}. Due to pressure from the rising of the [[Rocky Mountains]] in southwestern Alberta, 80 to 55 million years ago, the oil was driven northeast hundreds of kilometres and trapped into underground sand deposits left behind by ancient river beds and ocean beaches, thus forming the oil sands.&lt;ref name=oilsandfacts/&gt;

==History==

=== Ancient times ===
The use of natural [[bitumen]] for [[waterproofing]], and as an [[adhesive]] dates at least to the fifth [[millennium]] BC, with a crop storage basket discovered in [[Mehrgarh]], of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], lined with it.&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, Jane. The Ancient Indus Valley. p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; By the 3rd millennia BC refined rock asphalt was in use, in the region, and was used to waterproof the [[Great Bath, Mohenjo-daro]].

In the ancient Middle East, the [[Sumer]]ians used natural bitumen deposits for [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] between [[brick]]s and stones, to cement parts of carvings, such as eyes, into place, for ship [[caulking]], and for waterproofing.&lt;ref name="Abraham1938" /&gt; The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] said hot bitumen was used as mortar in the walls of [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, Book I, 179&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|1|km}} long [[Euphrates Tunnel]] beneath the river [[Euphrates]] at [[Babylon]] in the time of Queen [[Semiramis]] (ca. 800 BC) was reportedly constructed of burnt bricks covered with bitumen as a waterproofing agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/asphaltsandallie031010mbp/asphaltsandallie031010mbp_djvu.txt|title=Asphalts And Allied Substances|year=1920|author=Abraham, Herbert|publisher=D. Van Nostrand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bitumen was used by [[ancient Egypt]]ians to [[Embalming|embalm]] mummies.&lt;ref name="Abraham1938" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pringle, Heather Anne |title=The Mummy Congress: Science, Obsession, and the Everlasting Dead |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books |location=New York, NY |year=2001 |pages= 196–197|isbn=0-7607-7151-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Persian language|Persian]] word for asphalt is ''moom'', which is related to the English word [[mummy]]. The Egyptians' primary source of bitumen was the [[Dead Sea]], which the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] knew as ''Palus Asphaltites'' (Asphalt Lake).

Approximately 40 AD, [[Dioscorides]] described the [[Dead Sea]] material as ''Judaicum bitumen'', and noted other places in the region where it could be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=De Materia Medica|author=Pedanius Dioscorides|year=}}. Original written ca. 40 AD, translated by Goodyer (1655) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090206022946/http://www.therenaissanceman.org/images/DIOSCORIDES-Intro_Book_1.doc] ''or'' ''(Greek/Latin)'' compiled by Sprengel (1829) [https://books.google.com/books/download/Pedanii_Dioscoridis_____de_materia_medic.pdf?id=JwAUAAAAQAAJ&amp;output=pdf] p. 100 (p. 145 in PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;
The Sidon bitumen is thought to refer to material found at [[Hasbeya]].&lt;ref name="ConnanNissenbaum2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Connan|first1=Jacques|last2=Nissenbaum|first2=Arie|title=The organic geochemistry of the Hasbeya asphalt (Lebanon): comparison with asphalts from the Dead Sea area and Iraq|journal=Organic Geochemistry|volume=35|issue=6|year=2004|pages=775–789|issn=0146-6380|doi=10.1016/j.orggeochem.2004.01.015|url=https://www.academia.edu/16512751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny refers also to bitumen being found in [[Selenicë|Epirus]]. It was a valuable strategic resource, the object of the first known battle for a hydrocarbon deposit—between the [[Seleucid]]s and the [[Nabateans]] in 312 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://payperview.datapages.com/data/open/offer.do?target=%2Fbulletns%2F1977-79%2Fdata%2Fpg%2F0062%2F0005%2F0800%2F0837.htm|title=Dead Sea Asphalts—Historical Aspects [free abstract]|author=Arie Nissenbaum|journal=AAPG Bulletin|volume=62|issue=5|date=May 1978|pages=837–844|doi=10.1306/c1ea4e5f-16c9-11d7-8645000102c1865d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient Far East, natural bitumen was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher [[Fraction (chemistry)|fractions]], leaving a [[thermoplastic]] material of higher molecular weight that when layered on objects became quite hard upon cooling. This was used to cover objects that needed waterproofing,&lt;ref name="Abraham1938" /&gt; such as [[scabbard]]s and other items. [[Statuettes]] of household [[deities]] were also cast with this type of material in [[Japan]], and probably also in [[China]].

In [[North America]], archaeological recovery has indicated bitumen was sometimes used to adhere stone [[projectile point]]s to wooden shafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18502 |title=C.Michael Hogan (2008) '&amp;#39;Morro Creek'&amp;#39;, ed. by A. Burnham |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, aboriginal people used bitumen seeping out of the banks of the [[Athabasca River|Athabasca]] and other rivers to waterproof birch bark [[canoe]]s, and also heated it in smudge pots to ward off [[mosquito]]es in the summer.&lt;ref name=oilsandfacts/&gt;

===Continental Europe===
In 1553, [[Pierre Belon]] described in his work ''[[Observations (Pierre Belon)|Observations]]'' that ''pissasphalto'', a mixture of [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] and bitumen, was used in the [[Republic of Ragusa]] (now [[Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]]) for tarring of ships.&lt;ref&gt;Africa and the Discovery of America, Volume 1, page 183, [[Leo Wiener]], BoD – Books on Demand, 1920 reprinted in 2012, {{ISBN|978-3864034329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1838 edition of ''Mechanics Magazine'' cites an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, by "a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys, states that he had discovered the existence (of asphaltum) in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel", and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways – "principally in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in protecting, by means of the arches, the water-courses in the city of Paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth", which at that time made the water unusable. "He expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces" in palaces, "the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a Parisian of that generation".&lt;ref name="MechanicsMagazineSep1838176"&gt;{{cite book|date=7 April – 29 September 1838 | title=The Mechanic's magazine, museum, register, journal and gazette| volume=29|chapter=Nothing New under the Sun (on French asphaltum use in 1621)| publisher=W.A.

But the substance was generally neglected in France until the [[July Revolution|revolution of 1830]]. In the 1830s there was a surge of interest, and asphalt became widely used "for pavements, flat roofs, and the lining of cisterns, and in England, some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes". Its rise in Europe was "a sudden phenomenon", after natural deposits were found "in France at Osbann ([[Bas-Rhin]]), the Parc ([[Ain]]) and the Puy-de-la-Poix ([[Puy-de-Dôme]])", although it could also be made artificially.&lt;ref name="LewisMiles"&gt;{{cite book|author=Miles, Lewis|title=in Australian Building: A Cultural Investigation|volume=|chapter=Section 10.6: Damp Proofing|year=2000|publisher=|location=|page=10.06.1|url=http://www.mileslewis.net/australian-building/pdf/climatic-design/climatic-design-damp-proofing.pdf|accessdate=11 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215052541/http://mileslewis.net/australian-building/pdf/climatic-design/climatic-design-damp-proofing.pdf|archivedate=15 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}.

===United Kingdom===
Among the earlier uses of bitumen in the United Kingdom was for etching. William Salmon's ''Polygraphice'' (1673) provides a recipe for varnish used in etching, consisting of three ounces of virgin wax, two ounces of [[mastic (plant resin)|mastic]], and one ounce of asphaltum.&lt;ref name="SalmonPolygraphice"&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=Salmon|year=1673|publisher=R.

In 1838, there was a flurry of entrepreneurial activity involving asphalt, which had uses beyond paving. For example, asphalt could also be used for flooring, damp proofing in buildings, and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths, both of which were also proliferating in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Abraham1938"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LewisMiles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerhard1908"&gt;{{cite book|first=W.M.

=== United States ===
The first use of bitumen in the New World was by indigenous peoples. On the west coast, as early as the 13th century, the [[Tongva people|Tongva]], [[Luiseño people|Luiseño]] and [[Chumash people|Chumash]] peoples collected the naturally occurring bitumen that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits. All three groups used the substance as an adhesive. It is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items. For example, it was used on [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles. It was also used in decorations. Small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations. It was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water, possibly poisoning those who drank the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stockton|first1=Nick|title=Plastic Water Bottles Might Have Poisoned Ancient Californians|url=https://www.wired.com/story/plastic-water-bottles-might-have-poisoned-ancient-californians/|accessdate=26 June 2017|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Asphalt was used also to seal the planks on ocean-going canoes.

Asphalt was first used to pave streets in the 1870s.  At first naturally occurring "bituminous rock" was used, such as at Ritchie Mines in Macfarlan in [[Ritchie County, West Virginia]] from 1852 to 1873. In 1876, asphalt-based paving was used to pave Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC, in time for the celebration of the national centennial.&lt;ref name="NAPA2005"&gt;{{cite book|first=Dan|last=McNichol|year=2005|title=Paving the Way: Asphalt in America|edition=|chapter=|publisher=National Asphalt Pavement Association|location=Lanham, MD|pages=|url=http://store.hotmix.org/index.php?productID=144|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829062836/http://store.hotmix.org/index.php?productID=144|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-08-29|isbn=0-914313-04-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the horse-drawn era, streets were unpaved and covered with dirt or gravel.  However, that produced uneven wear, opened new hazards for pedestrians and made for dangerous potholes for bicycles and for motor vehicles. Manhattan alone had 130,000 horses in 1900, pulling streetcars, wagons, and carriages, and leaving their waste behind. They were not fast, and pedestrians could dodge and scramble their way across the crowded streets.  Small towns continued to rely on dirt and gravel, but larger cities wanted much better streets. They looked to wood or granite blocks by the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;David O. Whitten, "A Century of Parquet Pavements: Wood as a Paving Material In The United States And Abroad, 1840-1940." ''Essays in Economic and Business History'' 15 (1997): 209-26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, a third of Chicago's 2000 miles of streets were paved, chiefly with wooden blocks, which gave better traction than mud.  Brick surfacing was a good compromise, but even better was asphalt paving, which was easy to install and to cut through to get at sewers. With London and Paris serving as models, Washington laid 400,000 square yards of asphalt paving by 1882; it became the model for Buffalo, Philadelphia and elsewhere. By the end of the century, American cities boasted 30 million square yards of asphalt paving, well ahead of brick.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Maier Schlesinger, ''The Rise of the City: 1878-1898'' (1933) p 88-93.&lt;/ref&gt;  The streets became faster and more dangerous so electric traffic lights were installed.  Electric trolleys (at 12 miles per hour) became the main transportation service for middle class shoppers and office workers until they bought automobiles after 1945 and commuted from more distant suburbs in privacy and comfort on asphalt highways.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Fairfield, "Rapid Transit: Automobility and Settlement in Urban America" ''Reviews in American History'' 23#1 (1995), pp. 80-85 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2703240 online].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{see also | Bitumount | History of the petroleum industry in Canada (oil sands and heavy oil)}}
Canada has the world's largest deposit of natural bitumen in the [[Athabasca oil sands]], and Canadian [[First Nations]] along the [[Athabasca River]] had long used it to waterproof their canoes. In 1719, a [[Cree]] named Wa-Pa-Su brought a sample for trade to [[Henry Kelsey]] of the [[Hudson’s Bay Company]], who was the first recorded European to see it. However, it wasn't until 1787 that fur trader and explorer [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander MacKenzie]] saw the Athabasca oil sands and said, "At about 24 miles from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance."&lt;ref name=oilsandfacts/&gt;

The value of the deposit was obvious from the start, but the means of extracting the bitumen was not. The nearest town, [[Fort McMurray, Alberta]], was a small fur trading post, other markets were far away, and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving. In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the product to pave 600 feet of road in [[Edmonton]], Alberta. Other roads in Alberta were paved with material extracted from oil sands, but it was generally not economic. During the 1920s [[Karl Clark (chemist)|Dr. Karl A. Clark]] of the [[Alberta Research Council]] patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur Robert C. Fitzsimmons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.canadianpetroleumhalloffame.ca/robert-fitzsimmons.html | title = Robert C. Fitzsimmons (1881–1971) | year = 2010 | publisher = Canadian Petroleum Hall of Fame | access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; built the [[Bitumount]] oil separation plant, which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to {{convert|300|oilbbl|sigfig=1}} per day of bitumen using Dr. Clark's method. Most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs, but other uses included fuels, lubrication oils, printers ink, medicines, rust- and acid-proof paints, fireproof roofing, street paving, patent leather, and fence post preservatives.&lt;ref name = oilsandfacts/&gt; Eventually Fitzsimmons ran out of money and the plant was taken over by the Alberta government. Today the Bitumount plant is a [[Provincial historic sites of Alberta|Provincial Historic Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.history.alberta.ca/energyheritage/bitumount/default.aspx | title = Bitumount | year = 2016 | publisher = Government of Alberta | access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photography and art===
Bitumen was used in early photographic technology. In 1826 or 1827, it was used by French scientist [[Joseph Nicéphore Niépce]] to make the [[View from the Window at Le Gras|oldest surviving photograph from nature]]. The bitumen was thinly coated onto a [[pewter]] plate which was then exposed in a camera. Exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained. Many hours of exposure in the camera were required, making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a [[photoresist]] in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niepce.org/pagus/pagus-inv.html Niépce Museum history pages.] Retrieved 27 October 2012. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803222723/http://www.niepce.org/pagus/pagus-inv.html |date=3 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/wfp/ The First Photograph (Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin).] Retrieved 27 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century. Although widely used for a time, it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common diluents, such as linseed oil, varnish and turpentine. Unless thoroughly diluted, bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact. The use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings, for instance those of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]. Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is [[Théodore Géricault]]'s [[Raft of the Medusa]] (1818–1819), where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle.&lt;ref name="WSJ 2009-08-21"&gt;{{cite news |last=Spiegelman |first=Willard |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204119704574236393080650258 |title=Revolutionary Romanticism: 'The Raft of the Medusa' brought energy to French art |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |location=New York City |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2016-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==

=== Global use ===
The vast majority of refined asphalt is used in construction: primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications. According to the requirements of the end use, asphalt is produced to specification. This is achieved either by refining or blending. It is estimated that the current world use of asphalt is approximately 102 million tonnes per year. Approximately 85% of all the asphalt produced is used as the [[Binder (material)|binder]] in asphalt concrete for roads. It is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways, car parks and footways. Typically, the production of asphalt concrete involves mixing fine and coarse [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]] such as [[sand]], [[gravel]] and crushed rock with asphalt, which acts as the binding agent. Other materials, such as recycled polymers (e.g., [[Natural rubber|rubber]] [[tire|tyres]]), may be added to the asphalt to modify its properties according to the application for which the asphalt is ultimately intended.
  
A further 10% of global asphalt production is used in roofing applications, where its waterproofing qualities are invaluable.
The remaining 5% of asphalt is used mainly for sealing and insulating purposes in a variety of building materials, such as pipe coatings, carpet tile backing and paint.
Asphalt is applied in the construction and maintenance of many structures, systems, and components, such as the following:

=== Rolled asphalt concrete ===
{{main|Asphalt concrete}}The largest use of asphalt is for making [[asphalt concrete]] for road surfaces; this accounts for approximately 85% of the asphalt consumed in the United States. There are about 4,000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the US, and a similar number in Europe.&lt;ref name="the_asphalt_paving_industry_2nd_ed"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Asphalt Paving Industry: A Global Perspective, 2nd Edition | publisher = National Asphalt Pavement Association and European Asphalt Pavement Association | date = February 2011  | location = Lanham, Maryland, and Brussels | url = http://www.asphaltpavement.org/images/stories/GL_101_Edition_3.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 27 September 2012 | isbn = 0-914313-06-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asphalt concrete pavement mixes are typically composed of 5% asphalt cement and 95% aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel). Due to its highly viscous nature, asphalt cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility. The temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the asphalt and the aggregates, but [[Asphalt concrete#Mixture formulations|warm-mix asphalt technologies]] allow producers to reduce the temperature required.&lt;ref name="the_asphalt_paving_industry_2nd_ed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whats_in_your_asphalt_2017_09_fhwa" /&gt;

The weight of an asphalt pavement depends upon the [[aggregate (paving)|aggregate]] type, the asphalt, and the air void content. An average example in the United States is about 112 pounds per square yard, per inch of pavement thickness.&lt;ref name="whats_in_your_asphalt_2017_09_fhwa" /&gt;

When maintenance is performed on asphalt pavements, such as [[Pavement milling|milling]] to remove a worn or damaged surface, the removed material can be returned to a facility for processing into new pavement mixtures. The asphalt in the removed material can be reactivated and put back to use in new pavement mixes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=How Should We Express RAP and RAS Contents? |journal=Asphalt Technology E-News |year=2014 |authorlink=National Center for Asphalt Technology |volume=26 |issue=2 |url=http://www.eng.auburn.edu/research/centers/ncat/info-pubs/newsletters/fall-2014/recycledcontents.html |accessdate=2015-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609020500/http://www.eng.auburn.edu/research/centers/ncat/info-pubs/newsletters/fall-2014/recycledcontents.html |archivedate=9 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With some 95% of paved roads being constructed of or surfaced with asphalt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2012/hm12.cfm |title=Highway Statistics Series: Public Road Length Miles by Type of Surface and Ownership |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date=2013-10-01 |accessdate=2015-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a substantial amount of asphalt pavement material is reclaimed each year. According to industry surveys conducted annually by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] and the National Asphalt Pavement Association, more than 99% of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements, roadbeds, shoulders and embankments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asphalt Pavement Recycling|url=http://www.asphaltpavement.org/recycling|work=Annual Asphalt Pavement Industry Survey on Recycled Materials and Warm-Mix Asphalt Usage: 2009–2013|publisher=National Asphalt Pavement Association|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asphalt concrete paving is widely used in airports around the world. Due to the sturdiness and ability to be repaired quickly, it is widely used for [[runway]]s.

=== Mastic asphalt ===
{{further|Fibre mastic asphalt}}
[[Mastic asphalt]] is a type of asphalt that differs from dense graded asphalt ([[asphalt concrete]]) in that it has a higher asphalt ([[binder (material)|binder]]) content, usually around 7–10% of the whole aggregate mix, as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete, which has only around 5% asphalt. This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground. Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of {{convert|210|°C|°F}} and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about {{convert|20|mm|in|1|abbr=off|sp=us}} thick.

=== Asphalt emulsion ===
A number of technologies allow asphalt to be mixed at much lower temperatures. These involve mixing with petroleum solvents to form "cutbacks" with reduced melting point or mixing with water to turn the asphalt into an [[emulsion]]. Asphalt emulsions contain up to 70% asphalt and typically less than 1.5% chemical additives. There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates, [[cationic]] and [[anionic]]. Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications. [[Chipseal]] involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock, gravel or crushed slag. Slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road. Cold-mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt, several inches in depth, and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low-cost pavements.

=== Synthetic crude oil ===
{{main|Synthetic crude oil}}
{{see also|Petroleum production in Canada}}
Synthetic crude oil, also known as syncrude, is the output from a bitumen upgrader facility used in connection with oil sand production in Canada. Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) [[power shovel]]s and loaded into even larger (400 ton capacity) [[dump trucks]] for movement to an upgrading facility. The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by [[Karl Clark (chemist)|Dr. Karl Clark]] of the [[University of Alberta]] during the 1920s. After extraction from the sand, the bitumen is fed into a [[Upgrader|bitumen upgrader]] which converts it into a [[light crude oil]] equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional [[oil pipeline]]s and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment. By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over {{convert|1|Moilbbl}} per day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States.&lt;ref name=NEBstats&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.neb-one.gc.ca/nrg/sttstc/crdlndptrlmprdct/index-eng.html | title = Crude Oil and Petroleum Products | publisher  = [[National Energy Board]] of Canada | accessdate = January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alberta, five bitumen upgraders produce synthetic crude oil and a variety of other products: The [[Suncor Energy]] upgrader near [[Fort McMurray, Alberta]] produces synthetic crude oil plus diesel fuel; the [[Syncrude Canada]], [[Canadian Natural Resources]], and [[Nexen]] upgraders near Fort McMurray produce synthetic crude oil; and the Shell [[Scotford Upgrader]] near Edmonton produces synthetic crude oil plus an intermediate feedstock for the nearby Shell Oil Refinery.&lt;ref name=CAPP2015&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.capp.ca/publications-and-statistics/publications/264673 |title=2015 CAPP Crude Oil Forecast, Markets &amp; Transportation |publisher=[[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] |accessdate=January 21, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120081514/http://www.capp.ca/publications-and-statistics/publications/264673 |archivedate=20 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A sixth upgrader, under construction in 2015 near [[Redwater, Alberta]], will upgrade half of its crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel, with the remainder of the output being sold as feedstock to nearby oil refineries and petrochemical plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.nwrpartnership.com/ | title = The Project | publisher = North West Redwater Partnership | accessdate = January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-upgraded crude bitumen ===
{{See also|Western Canadian Select}}
Canadian bitumen does not differ substantially from oils such as Venezuelan extra-heavy and Mexican [[heavy crude oil|heavy oil]] in chemical composition, and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through [[oil pipeline]]s to the refinery. Many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and refined asphalt without any preprocessing. This is particularly common in areas such as the US [[Gulf coast]], where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil, and in areas such as the US [[Midwest]] where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined. Given the choice, such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower, and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline.&lt;ref name=CAPP2015/&gt; By 2015 Canadian production and exports of non-upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over {{convert|1.3|Moilbbl}} per day, of which about 65% was exported to the United States.&lt;ref name=NEBstats/&gt;

Because of the difficulty of moving crude bitumen through pipelines, non-upgraded bitumen is usually diluted with [[natural-gas condensate]] in a form called [[dilbit]] or with synthetic crude oil, called [[synbit]]. However, to meet international competition, much non-upgraded bitumen is now sold as a blend of multiple grades of bitumen, conventional crude oil, synthetic crude oil, and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such as [[Western Canadian Select]].

Asphalt was used starting in the 1960s as an [[hydrophobic]] matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium-activity salts (mainly soluble [[sodium nitrate]] and [[sodium sulfate]]) produced by the reprocessing of [[spent nuclear fuel]]s or radioactive [[sludge]]s from sedimentation ponds.&lt;ref&gt;Rodier, J., Scheidhauer, J., &amp; Malabre, M. (1961). The conditioning of radioactive waste by bitumen (No. CEA-R—1992). CEA Marcoule.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lefillatre, G., Rodier, J., Hullo, R., Cudel, Y., &amp; Rodi, L. (1969). Use of a thin-film evaporator for bitumen coating of radioactive concentrates (No. CEA-R—3742). CEA Marcoule.&lt;/ref&gt; Bituminised radioactive waste containing highly [[radiotoxic]] [[ionizing radiation#Alpha particles|alpha-emitting]] [[Transuranium element|transuranic element]]s from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in France, Belgium and Japan, but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues (risks of fire, as occurred in a bituminisation plant at Tokai Works in Japan)&lt;ref&gt;Sato, Y., Miura, A., Kato, Y., Suzuki, H., Shigetome, Y., Koyama, T., ... &amp; Yamanouchi, T. (2000). Study on the cause of the fire and explosion incident at Bituminization Demonstration Facility of PNC Tokai Works. In Nuclear waste: from research to industrial maturity. International conference (pp. 179–190).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Okada, K., Nur, R. M., &amp; Fujii, Y. (1999). The formation of explosive compounds in bitumen/nitrate mixtures. Journal of hazardous materials, 69(3), 245–256.&lt;/ref&gt; and long-term stability problems related to their [[Deep geological repository|geological disposal]] in deep rock formations. One of the main problem is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation because of the presence of [[hydrogen]] gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma [[radiolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D.I., Hitchon, J.W., &amp; Phillips, D.C. (1986). Further observations of the swelling of bitumens and simulated bitumen wasteforms during γ-irradiation (No. AERE-R—12292). UKAEA Harwell Lab. Materials Development Division.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, D. C., Hitchon, J. W., Johnson, D. I., &amp; Matthews, J. R. (1984). The radiation swelling of bitumens and bitumenised wastes. Journal of nuclear materials, 125(2), 202–218.&lt;/ref&gt; A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated [[hygroscopic]] salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve. The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for [[osmosis|osmotic]] effects inside the bituminised matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a [[Semipermeable membrane|semi-permeable membrane]]. This also causes the matrix to swell. The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste. When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high [[ionic strength]] of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the [[redox]] conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as [[selenium]], [[technetium]], [[uranium]], [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] have a higher solubility and are also often present in water as non-retarded [[anion]]s. This makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging.

Different type of asphalt have been used: blown bitumen (partly oxidized with air oxygen at high temperature after distillation, and harder) and direct distillation bitumen (softer). Blown bitumens like Mexphalte, with a high content of saturated hydrocarbons, are more easily biodegraded by microorganisms than direct distillation bitumen, with a low content of saturated hydrocarbons and a high content of aromatic hydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;Ait-Langomazino, N., Sellier, R., Jouquet, G., &amp; Trescinski, M. (1991). Microbial degradation of bitumen. Experientia, 47(6), 533–539.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concrete encapsulation of radwaste is presently considered a safer alternative by the [[nuclear industry]] and the waste management organisations.

===Other uses===
[[Asphalt shingle|Roofing shingle]]s account for most of the remaining asphalt consumption. Other uses include cattle sprays, fence-post treatments, and waterproofing for fabrics. Asphalt is used to make [[Japan black]], a [[lacquer]] known especially for its use on iron and steel, and it is also used in paint and marker inks by some exterior paint supply companies to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint or ink, and to make the color darker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohd|first=Meraj Jafri|last2=Singh|first2=D. K.|date=1 Mar 2013|title=Cashew Nutshell Liquid Resin|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f5e2/547698e8e0070452ffeee58903bb4b0c5946.pdf|journal=IJRREST: International Journal of Research Review in Engineering Science and Technology|volume=2|pages=60–65|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asphalt is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process.

==Production==
[[File:Asphalt plant pic.jpg|thumbnail|right|Typical asphalt plant for making asphalt]]
About 40,000,000 tons were produced in 1984.{{update inline|date=June 2014}} It is obtained as the "heavy" (i.e., difficult to distill) fraction. Material with a [[boiling point]] greater than around 500&amp;nbsp;°C is considered asphalt. Vacuum distillation separates it from the other components in crude oil (such as [[naphtha]], gasoline and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]). The resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications. In a [[de-asphalting unit]], the crude asphalt is treated with either [[propane]] or [[butane]] in a [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] phase to extract the lighter molecules, which are then separated. Further processing is possible by "blowing" the product: namely reacting it with [[oxygen]]. This step makes the product harder and more viscous.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

Asphalt is typically stored and transported at temperatures around {{convert|150|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Sometimes [[diesel oil]] or [[kerosene]] are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity; upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture. This mixture is often called "bitumen feedstock", or BFS. Some [[dump truck]]s route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm. The backs of tippers carrying asphalt, as well as some handling equipment, are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release. Diesel oil is no longer used as a [[release agent]] due to environmental concerns.

===Oil sands===
{{main|Oil sands}}
Naturally occurring crude bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from "[[oil sands]]", currently under development in Alberta, Canada. Canada has most of the world's supply of natural bitumen, covering 140,000 square kilometres&lt;ref name=oilsands/&gt; (an area larger than England), giving it the second-largest proven [[oil reserves]] in the world. The [[Athabasca oil sands]] are the largest bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to [[surface mining]], although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by ''[[in-situ#Petroleum|in situ]]'' methods. Because of [[world oil market chronology from 2003|oil price increases after 2003]], producing bitumen became highly profitable, but as a result of the decline after 2014 it became uneconomic to build new plants again. By 2014, Canadian crude bitumen production averaged about {{convert|2.3|Moilbbl|m3}} per day and was projected to rise to {{convert|4.4|Moilbbl|m3}} per day by 2020.&lt;ref name="CAPP"/&gt; The total amount of crude bitumen in Alberta that could be extracted is estimated to be about {{convert|310|Goilbbl|e9m3|sigfig=1}},&lt;ref name=ST98/&gt; which at a rate of {{convert|4400000|oilbbl/d}} would last about 200 years.

===Alternatives and bioasphalt ===
{{Main|Peak oil|Global warming|Bioasphalt}}
Although uncompetitive economically, asphalt can be made from nonpetroleum-based renewable resources such as sugar, [[molasses]] and rice, corn and potato [[starch]]es. Asphalt can also be made from waste material by [[fractional distillation]] of used [[motor oil]], which is sometimes otherwise disposed of by burning or dumping into landfills. Use of motor oil may cause premature cracking in colder climates, resulting in roads that need to be repaved more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/10298436.2010.488729| issn = 1029-8436| volume = 11| issue = 6| pages = 541–553| last = Hesp| first = Simon A.M.|author2=Herbert F. Shurvell| title = X-ray fluorescence detection of waste engine oil residue in asphalt and its effect on cracking in service| journal = International Journal of Pavement Engineering| accessdate = 2014-03-24| year = 2010| url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10298436.2010.488729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonpetroleum-based asphalt binders can be made light-colored. Lighter-colored roads absorb less heat from solar radiation, reducing their contribution to the [[urban heat island]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/heatisland/ Heat Island Effect]. From the website of the US Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; Parking lots that use asphalt alternatives are called [[green parking lot]]s.

===Albanian deposits===
Selenizza is a naturally occurring solid hydrocarbon bitumen found in native deposits in [[Selenice]], in [[Albania]], the only European asphalt mine still in use. The bitumen is found in the form of veins, filling cracks in a more or less horizontal direction. The bitumen content varies from 83% to 92% (soluble in carbon disulphide), with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point (ring and ball) around 120&amp;nbsp;°C. The insoluble matter, consisting mainly of silica ore, ranges from 8% to 17%.
 
Albanian bitumen extraction has a long history and was practiced in an organized way by the Romans. After centuries of silence, the first mentions of Albanian bitumen appeared only in 1868, when the Frenchman [[Henri Coquand|Coquand]] published the first geological description of the deposits of Albanian bitumen. In 1875, the exploitation rights were granted to the Ottoman government and in 1912, they were transferred to the Italian company Simsa. Since 1945, the mine was exploited by the Albanian government and from 2001 to date, the management passed to a French company, which organized the mining process for the manufacture of the natural bitumen on an industrial scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giavarini|first1=Carlo|title=Six Thousand Years of Asphalt|date=March 2013|publisher=SITEB|isbn=978-88-908408-3-8|pages=71–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the mine is predominantly exploited in an open pit quarry but several of the many underground mines (deep and extending over several km) still remain viable. Selenizza is produced primarily in granular form, after melting the bitumen pieces selected in the mine.
 
Selenizza&lt;ref name="Selenice Bitumi"&gt;[http://www.selenicebitumi.com/engindex.php], Selenice Bitumi for more information about Selenizza&lt;/ref&gt; is mainly used as an additive in the road construction sector. It is mixed with traditional asphalt to improve both the viscoelastic properties and the resistance to ageing. It may be blended with the hot asphalt in tanks, but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants. Other typical applications include the production of mastic asphalts for sidewalks, bridges, car-parks and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for the oil and gas industry. Selenizza is available in powder or in granular material of various particle sizes and is packaged in sacks or in thermal fusible polyethylene bags.

A [[life-cycle assessment]] study of the natural selenizza compared with petroleum asphalt has shown that the environmental impact of the selenizza  is about half the impact of the road asphalt produced in oil refineries in terms of carbon dioxide emission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giavarini|first1=C.|last2=Pellegrini|first2=A.|title=Life cycle assessment of Selenice asphalt compared with petroleum bitumen|journal=The 1st Albanian Congress on Roads|pages=234–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==

Although asphalt typically makes up only 4 to 5 percent (by weight) of the pavement mixture, as the pavement’s binder, it is also the most expensive part of the cost of the road-paving material.&lt;ref name="whats_in_your_asphalt_2017_09_fhwa" /&gt;

During asphalt's early use in modern paving, oil refiners gave it away. However, asphalt is, today, a highly traded commodity. Its prices increased substantially in the early 21st Century. A U.S. government report states:
:"In 2002, asphalt sold for approximately $160 per ton. By the end of 2006, the cost had doubled to approximately $320 per ton, and then it almost doubled again in 2012 to approximately $610 per ton."&lt;ref name="whats_in_your_asphalt_2017_09_fhwa" /&gt;

The report indicates that an "average" 1-mile (1.6-kilometer)-long, four-lane highway would include "300 tons of asphalt," which, "in 2002 would have cost around $48,000. By 2006 this would have increased to $96,000 and by 2012 to $183,000... an increase of about $135,000 for every mile of highway in just 10 years."&lt;ref name="whats_in_your_asphalt_2017_09_fhwa" /&gt;

== Health and safety ==
People can be exposed to asphalt in the workplace by breathing in fumes or skin absorption. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] of 5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over a 15-minute period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC – NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards – Asphalt fumes|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0042.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asphalt is basically an inert material that must be heated or diluted to a point where it becomes workable for the production of materials for paving, roofing, and other applications. In examining the potential health hazards associated with asphalt, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) determined that it is the application parameters, predominantly temperature, that affect occupational exposure and the potential bioavailable [[carcinogenic]] hazard/risk of the asphalt emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=IARC |url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol103/ |title=Bitumens and Bitumen Emissions, and Some N- and S-Heterocyclic Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons |volume=103 |location=Lyon, France |publisher=[[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] |year=2013 |isbn=978-92-832-1326-0 |accessdate=2015-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, temperatures greater than 199&amp;nbsp;°C (390&amp;nbsp;°F), were shown to produce a greater exposure risk than when asphalt was heated to lower temperatures, such as those typically used in asphalt pavement mix production and placement.&lt;ref name="CavallariZwack2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavallari|first1=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10078">In [[molecular geometry]], '''bond length''' or '''bond distance''' is the average distance between nuclei of two [[chemical bond|bonded]] [[atom]]s in a [[molecule]]. It is a [[Transferability (chemistry)|transferable property]] of a bond between atoms of fixed types, relatively independent of the rest of the molecule.

== Explanation ==
Bond length is related to [[bond order]]: when more [[electron]]s participate in bond formation the bond is shorter. Bond length is also inversely related to [[bond strength]] and the [[bond dissociation energy]]: all other factors being equal, a stronger bond will be shorter. In a bond between two identical atoms, half the bond distance is equal to the [[covalent radius]].

Bond lengths are measured in the solid phase by means of [[X-ray diffraction]], or approximated in the gas phase by [[microwave spectroscopy]]. A bond between a given pair of atoms may vary between different molecules. For example, the carbon to hydrogen bonds in [[methane]] are different from those in [[methyl chloride]]. It is however possible to make generalizations when the general structure is the same.

== Bond lengths of carbon with other elements ==
A table with experimental [[single bond]]s for carbon to other elements{{Ref|1}} is given below. Bond lengths are given in [[picometer]]s. By approximation the bond distance between two different atoms is the sum of the individual [[covalent radius|covalent radii]] (these are given in the [[chemical element]] articles for each element). As a general trend, bond distances ''decrease'' across the ''row'' in the [[periodic table]] and ''increase'' down a ''group''. This trend is identical to that of the [[atomic radius]].

==Bond lengths in organic compounds==
The bond length between two atoms in a molecule depends not only on the atoms but also on such factors as the [[orbital hybridization]] and the electronic and [[steric effects|steric]] nature of the [[substituent]]s. The [[carbon–carbon bond|carbon–carbon (C–C) bond]] length in diamond is 154 pm, which is also the largest bond length that exists for ordinary carbon covalent bonds. Since one atomic unit of length(i.e., a Bohr radius) is 52.9177 pm, the C–C bond length is 2.91 atomic units, or approximately three  Bohr radii long.

Unusually long bond lengths do exist. In one compound, [[tricyclobutabenzene]], a bond length of 160 pm is reported. The current record holder is another cyclobutabenzene with length 174 pm based on [[X-ray crystallography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Naphthocyclobutenes and Benzodicyclobutadienes: Synthesis in the Solid State and Anomalies in the Bond Lengths |author=Fumio Toda |journal=European Journal of Organic Chemistry |volume=2000 |issue=8 |date=April 2000 |pages=1377–1386 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/71008297/ABSTRACT |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0690(200004)2000:8&lt;1377::AID-EJOC1377&gt;3.0.CO;2-I}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this type of compound the cyclobutane ring would force 90° angles on the carbon atoms connected to the benzene ring where they ordinarily have angles of 120°.

[[File:Unusualbondlength.png|center|200px|Cyclobutabenzene with a bond length in red of 174 pm]]

Shorter than average C–C bond distances are also possible: [[alkene]]s and [[alkyne]]s have bond lengths of respectively 133 and 120 pm due to increased [[orbital hybridization|s-character]] of the [[sigma bond]]. In [[benzene]] all bonds have the same length: 139 pm. Carbon–carbon single bonds increased s-character is also notable in the central bond of [[diacetylene]] (137 pm) and that of a certain [[tetrahedrane|tetrahedrane dimer]] (144 pm).

In [[propionitrile]] the [[cyano]] group withdraws electrons, also resulting in a reduced bond length (144 pm). Squeezing a C–C bond is also possible by application of [[steric strain|strain]]. An unusual organic compound exists called [[In-methylcyclophane]] with a very short bond distance of 147 pm for the methyl group being squeezed between a [[triptycene]] and a phenyl group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3492">'''Cavan''', sometimes spelled '''Caban''' or '''Kaban'''&lt;ref name=lje /&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Before the 28-letter [[Filipino alphabet]] was defined in the [[1987 Constitution]], the [[Abakada|Tagalog alphabet]] had only 20 letters that did not include a ''V'' and a ''C''.&lt;/ref&gt;) is [[Philippines|Filipino]] unit of [[mass]] and also a unit of [[volume]] or [[dry measure]].

== Description ==
''Cavan'' was defined in the 19th century by the government of the [[Spanish East Indies]] as being equivalent to 75 litres.&lt;ref name=sizes1 /&gt; Though officially the Philippines became entirely metric in 1860, this value was still in use well into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=sizes2 /&gt;

''Cavan'' was reported in the late 19th century as a measure for rice equivalent to 98.28 litres.&lt;ref name=sizes3 /&gt; Various references from the same period describe it as a unit of mass: for rice, 133&amp;nbsp;lb (about 60.33&amp;nbsp;kg); for cocoa, 83.5&amp;nbsp;lb, (about 37.87&amp;nbsp;kg) one source says on the average 60&amp;nbsp;kg for rice and 38&amp;nbsp;kg for cacao&lt;ref name=sizes4 /&gt;). Other sources claim it was the equivalent of 58.2&amp;nbsp;kg. 

In all likelihood, this is a case in which some commodities began to be traded by weight instead of volume, and a “caban of rice” became a certain mass rather than a certain volume. One source states that before 1973 a cavan of any type of rice weighed 50&amp;nbsp;kg. One source says that after 1973 a cavan of rough rice weighed 44&amp;nbsp;kg and a cavan of milled rice weighed 56&amp;nbsp;kg (the significance of the 1973 date is unclear).&lt;ref name=sizes5 /&gt;

Usage example: "At present, owing to the late scarcity of rice in [[Ambos Camarines|Camarines]] and [[Leyte]], the price of paddy at [[Iloilo]] has risen to 10 rials per province cavan, which is equal to one and a half of the measure ({{lang|es|cavan del rey}}) used at Manila."&lt;ref name=sizes6 /&gt;

[[Image:Charactron layout 1.jpg|thumb|250px|Basic Charactron tube design]]
'''Charactron''' was a [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S.]] [[registered trademark]] (number 0585950, 23 February 1954) of Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation ([[Convair]]) for its shaped electron beam [[cathode ray tube]]. Charactron CRTs performed functions of both a display device and a [[read-only memory]] storing multiple characters and fonts.  The similar '''Typotron''' was a U.S. registered trademark (23 November 1953) of [[Hughes Aircraft Corporation]] for its type of shaped electron beam [[storage tube]] with a direct-view bistable storage screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/201/6/6577.pdf |publisher=[[Hughes Aircraft Corporation]] |title= ''Typotron, 5" character-writing CRT-type storage tube'' data sheet |date=24 November 1954 |format=PDF |accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charactron CRT used an electron beam to flood a specially patterned perforated anode that contained the stencil patterns for each of the characters that it could form. The first deflection positioning of the electron beam steered the beam to pass through one of the (typically 64 or 116) characters and symbols that could be formed. The beam, which then had the cross-section of the desired character, was re-centered along the axis of the tube and deflected to the desired position of the screen for display.  Alternately, as in the accompanying image, the entire matrix was filled with the electron beam then deflected through a selection aperture to isolate one character.

The term Charactron is sometimes mistakenly applied to another type of CRT properly called a [[monoscope]] which generates an electrical signal by scanning an electron beam of uniform cross section across a printed pattern on an internal target electrode.

==Applications==
There were two basic types/uses of Charactrons:
# Direct view — where the intended user watched the face of the tube.  An example was the {{convert|19|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} tube of the AN/FSQ-7 SAGE [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment]] computer console.
# Photographic output — where the display screen was photographed by a [[microfilm]] camera for recording of computer generated data.  The Stromberg-Carlson SC-4000 series system was a typical use of the {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} tube

The technical expertise, and trademarks, for the Charactron ultimately passed to [[Stromberg-Carlson]], [[General Dynamics]], Stromberg DatagraphiX, [[Anacomp]], and finally Lexel Imaging Systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34059">'''Convective storm detection''' is the [[meteorology|meteorological]] observation of deep, moist [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] (DMC) and consists of detection, monitoring, and short-term prediction. Convective storms can produce [[tornado]]es as well as large [[hail]], strong [[wind]]s, and heavy [[rain]] leading to [[flash flood]]ing. The detection of convective storms relies on direct eyewitness observations, for example from [[storm spotter]]s; and on [[remote sensing]], especially [[weather radar]]. Some [[in situ]] measurements are used for direct detection as well, notably, [[wind speed]] reports from [[Surface weather observation|surface observation]] stations. It is part of the ''integrated warning system'', consisting of prediction, detection, and dissemination of information on [[severe weather]] to users such as emergency management, storm spotters and chasers, the media, and the general public.&lt;ref name="spotter history"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:1965May06 1919.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1960s radar technology ([[WSR-57]]) displaying supercells over [[Minneapolis – Saint Paul]] during the [[1965 Twin Cities tornado outbreak]]]]

Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm.

However, with the advent of weather radar, areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public [[tornado warning]]s were issued in 1950 and the first [[tornado watch]]es and [[Storm Prediction Center#Convective outlooks|convective outlooks]] in 1952.&lt;ref name = "Galway"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Galway |first = Joseph G. |authorlink = Joseph G.

By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms likely producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away.&lt;ref name = "hook echoes"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Markowski |first = Paul M. |authorlink = Paul M.

Green colors indicate areas where the precipitation is moving towards the radar dish, while red areas are moving away. In this case the radar is in the bottom right corner of the image.  Strong [[mesocyclone]]s show up as adjacent areas of bright green and bright red, and usually indicate an imminent or occurring tornado.]]--&gt;
In the mid-1970s, the US [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) increased its efforts to train [[storm spotter]]s to identify and report key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and [[flash flood]]ing. The program was called [[Skywarn]], and the spotters were local [[Sheriff|sheriff's deputies]], [[State police|state troopers]], [[firefighter]]s, [[ambulance driver]]s, [[amateur radio operator]]s, [[civil defense]] (now [[emergency management]]) spotters, [[Storm chasing|storm chaser]]s, and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can issue a timely warning.

Usually, spotters are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and they report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as [[Civil defense siren|sirens]] and the [[Emergency Alert System]], and forward the reports to the NWS, which does directly disseminate [[Severe weather terminology (United States)|information and warnings]] through its [[NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards]] network.&lt;ref name = "spotter history"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Doswell |first = Charles A.

In [[Canada]], a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called [[Canwarn]], helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers.&lt;ref name="environment Canada detection"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.ec.gc.ca/air/summersevere/ae00s10.en.html |title=Tornado Detection at Environment Canada|accessdate=2007-03-16|publisher=[[Environment Canada]]|date=2004-06-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407123441/http://www.mb.ec.gc.ca/air/summersevere/ae00s10.en.html |archivedate=2010-04-07|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of [[Skywarn Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skywarn.eu/ Skywarn Europe], Archived at: {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917011719/http://www.skywarn.eu/ |date=2009-09-17}}, retrieved on 2007-05-18&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Tornado and Storm Research Organisation]] (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the [[United Kingdom]] since the 1970s.

Storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as [[NEXRAD]], and satellite images, do not detect tornadoes or hail, only indications that the storm has the potential.&lt;ref name="Training"&gt;Chance Hayes, National Weather Service Wichita, Kansas. "Storm Fury on the Plains." Storm Spotter Training. 4H Building, Salina, Kansas. 22 Feb. 2010. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt; Radar and satellite data interpretation will usually give a warning before there is any visual evidence of such events, but [[ground truth]] from an observer can either verify the threat or determine it is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what these remote sensing devices cannot is especially important as distance from a radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, due to curvature of Earth and the spread of the beam with distance. Therefore, when far from a radar, only precipitations and velocities high in the storm are observed. The important areas might not then be sampled or the resolution of the data might be poor. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.&lt;ref name="Training"/&gt;

=== Visual evidence ===
[[File:Wall cloud12 - NOAA.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A rotating [[wall cloud]] with [[rear flank downdraft]] clear slot evident to its left rear.]]

Storm spotters are trained to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a [[supercell]].&lt;ref name="Training"/&gt; They typically look to its rear, the main region of [[updraft]] and [[inflow (meteorology)|inflow]].&lt;ref name="Training"/&gt; Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of [[tornadogenesis]] is the formation of a rotating [[wall cloud]]. The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell.&lt;ref name="Basic Spotter Guide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/images/pah/pdf/basicspotterguide.pdf |format=PDF|title=Basic Spotters’ Field Guide |accessdate=2016-11-30 |author=Edwards, Moller, Purpura |year=2005 |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of a supercell comes from the storm's shape and structure, and [[cumulonimbus cloud|cloud tower]] features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent and/or large [[overshooting top]], a hard anvil (especially when [[backsheared anvil|backsheared]] against strong upper level [[wind]]s), and a corkscrew look or [[:wikt:striation|striation]]s.&lt;ref name="Training"/&gt; Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a "beaver tail", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the forward flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and [[forward flank downdraft]], and requires a "balance" between the outflow and inflow.&lt;ref name="Advanced Spotter Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/images/pah/pdf/advancedguide.pdf |format=PDF |title=Advanced Spotters' Field Guide |accessdate=2016-11-30 |author=Doswell, Moller, Anderson |year=2005 |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |display-authors=etal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823090940/http://www.weather.gov/os/brochures/adv_spotters.pdf |archivedate=2006-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds are the visual manifestation of a [[mesocyclone]]. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a [[rear flank downdraft]] occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of [[cloud]] adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a [[funnel cloud]] dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters monitor all areas of a storm and their surroundings.&lt;ref name="NSSL tornadoes"&gt;{{cite web |title=Questions and Answers about Tornadoes |work=A Severe Weather Primer |publisher=[[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] |date=2006-11-15 |url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/tornado/tor_basics.html |accessdate=2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radar ==
{{Main|Weather radar|Lemon technique}}

Today, most developed countries have a network of [[weather radar]]s, which remains the main method of detecting signatures likely associated with tornadoes and other severe phenomenons as [[hail]] and [[downburst]]s. Radar is always available, in places and times where spotters are not, and can also see features that spotters cannot, in the darkness of night and processes hidden within the cloud as well as invisible processes outside the cloud.

In short-term prediction and detection of tornadoes, [[meteorologist]]s integrate radar data with reports from the field and knowledge of the meteorological environment. Radar analysis is augmented by automated detection systems called [[algorithm]]s. Meteorologists first look at the atmospheric environment as well as changes thereof, and once storms develop, storm motion and interaction with the environment.

An early step in a storm organizing into a tornado producer is the formation of a weak echo region (WER) with a [[tilted updraft]]. This is an area within the thunderstorm where precipitation should be occurring but is "pulled" aloft by a very strong updraft. The weak echo region is characterized by weak reflectivity with a sharp gradient to strong reflectivity above it and partially surrounding the sides. The region of the [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] lofted above the WER is the echo overhang consisting of precipitation particles diverging from the storm's summit that descend as they are carried downwind. Within this area, a [[bounded weak echo region]] ([[Bounded weak echo region|BWER]]) may then form above and enclosing the WER. A BWER is found near the top of the updraft and nearly or completely surrounded by strong reflectivity, and is indicative of a supercell capable of cyclic tornadogenesis. A mesocyclone may descend or a tornado may form in the lower level of the storm simultaneously as the mesocyclone forms.

In [[reflectivity]] (precipitation intensity) data, a tight echo gradient (particularly on the inflow area) and a fan shape generally indicate a [[supercell]]. A V-notch or "flying eagle echo" tend to be most pronounced with intense classic supercells, the type of supercell that produces most of the strongest, largest, and longest lived tornadoes. This is not to be confused with an inflow notch; which is a lower level indentation in the precipitation where there is little to no reflectivity, indicative of strong, organized inflow and a severe storm that is most likely a supercell. The rear inflow notch (or weak echo channel) occurs to the east or north of a mesocyclone and hook echo. Forward inflow notches also occur, particularly on high-precipitation supercells (HP) and quasi-linear convective systems (QLCS).

In the United States and a few other countries, [[Weather radar#Velocity|Doppler]] capable weather radar stations are used. These devices are capable of measuring the radial [[velocity]], including radial [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160&amp;nbsp;km) away. A supercell is characterized by a mesocyclone, which is usually first observed in velocity data as a tight, cyclonic structure in the middle levels of the thunderstorm. If it meets certain requirements of strength, duration, and [[vorticity]], it may trip the [[mesocyclone]] detection algorithm (MDA). Tornadic signatures are indicated by a cyclonic inbound-outbound velocity couplet, where strong winds flowing in one direction and strong winds flowing in the opposite direction are occurring in very close proximity. The algorithm for this is the [[tornadic vortex signature]] (TVS) or the tornado detection algorithm (TDA). TVS is then an extremely strong mesocyclone found at very low level and extending over a deep layer of the thunderstorm, not the actual tornadic circulation. The TVS is, however, indicative of a likely tornado or an incipient tornado. The couplet and TVS typically precede tornado formation by 10–30 minutes but may occur at nearly the same time or precede the tornado by 45 minutes or more. Polarimetric radar can discern meteorological and nonmeteorological and other characteristics of hydrometeors that are helpful to tornado detection and nowcasting. Nonmeteorological reflectors co-located with a couplet, can confirm that a tornado has likely occurred and lofted debris. An area of high reflectivity, or debris ball, may also be visible on the end of the hook. Either the polarimetric data or debris ball are formally known as the [[tornado debris signature]] (TDS). The [[hook echo]] feature is formed as the [[rear flank downdraft|RFD]] occludes precipitation around the mesocyclone and is also indicative of a probable tornado (tornadogenesis usually ensues shortly after the RFD reaches the surface).

After the implementation of the [[NEXRAD|WSR-88D]] network in the U.S., the probability of detection of tornadoes increased substantially, the average lead time rose from four minutes to thirteen minutes, and a 2005 [[NOAA]] report estimates that as a result of improved warnings that there are 45 percent fewer fatalities and 40 percent fewer injuries annually. Dual-[[polarimetry|polarization]] radar, being implemented to the US [[NEXRAD]] network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roc.noaa.gov/WSR88D/DualPol/Default.aspx |title=Radar Operations Center|website=roc.noaa.gov|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; may provide enhanced warning of tornadoes and severe winds and hail associated with the hook echo due to distinct precipitation drop characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumjian|first=Matthew R.|title=Precipitation properties of supercell hook echoes|journal=Electronic J.

In certain atmospheric environments, [[wind profiler]]s may also provide detection capabilities for tornadic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Hocking |first = Anna |author2 = W. K.

=== Hail, downburst and downpour ===
[[File:Coupe verticale VIL.png|thumb|Vertical cross-section of a thunderstorm at the top and VIL value of 63 kg/m² with that cell at the bottom (red one), giving potential for hail, downpour, and/or downdraft]]

Hail forms in a very intense [[updraft]] in a supercell or a multicellular thunderstorm. As for tornadoes, BWER detection and a tilted updraft are indicative of that updraft but does not lead to predict hail. The presence of a [[Three body scatter spike|hail spike]] in the reflectivity pattern is an important clue. It is an area of weak reflectivity extending away from the radar immediately behind a thunderstorm with hail. It is caused by radiation from the radar bouncing from hailstone to hailstone or the ground before being reflected back to the radar. The time delay between the backscattered radiation from the storm and the one with multiple paths causes the reflectivity from the hail to appear to come from a farther range than the actual storm.&lt;ref name="NWS2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nws.noaa.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=h |title=Hail spike|work=Glossary|publisher=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office Albany, New York|date=June 2009|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this artefact is visible mostly for extremely large hail.

What is needed is a knowledge of the water content in the thunderstorm, the freezing level and the height of the summit of the precipitation. One way of calculating the water content is to transform the reflectivities in rain rate at all levels in the clouds and to sum it up. This is done by an algorithm called ''[[Vertically integrated liquid]]'', or VIL. This value represent the total amount of liquid water in the cloud that is available. If the cloud would rain out completely, it would be the amount of rain falling on the ground and one can estimate with VIL the potential for [[flash flood]].&lt;ref name="NWS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/hq/ssd/erps/ta/ta2002-03.pdf |title=Development of Warning Criteria for Severe Pulse Thunderstorms ine the Northeastern United States using the WSR-88D |format=pdf |author1=Carl S. Cerniglia |author2=Warren R. Snyder |publisher=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office Albany, New York |date=Jun 2002 |accessdate= 2008-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the reflectivities are greatly enhanced by hail and VIL is greatly overestimating the rain potential in presence of hail. On the other hand, [[National Weather Service]] meteorologists have found that the VIL density, that is to say VIL divided by the maximum height of the 18 [[dBZ (meteorology)|dBZ]] in the cloud, is a good indicator of the presence of hail when it reach 3.5.&lt;ref name="NWS"/&gt; This is a crude yes/no index and other algorithms have been developed involving VIL and the freezing level height.&lt;ref name="NWS"/&gt; More recently, [[Weather radar#Polarization|dual polarization]] of weather radar have shown promising direct detection of hail.

VIL can be used to estimate the potential for [[downburst]], too. A convective [[downdraft]] is linked to three forces in the vertical, namely perturbation pressure gradient force, buoyancy force and precipitation loading. The pressure gradient force was neglected as it has significant effect only on the updraft in supercells. With this assumption and other simplifications (e.g. requiring the environment of the air parcel to be static on the time scale of the downdraft). The resulting momentum equation is integrated over height to yield the [[kinetic energy]] of the parcel on descending to the surface and is found to be the negative [[Convective Available Potential Energy|CAPE]] of a dry air parcel injected into the storm, plus de motion of the convective cell. S. R. Stewart, from NWS, has published in 1991 an equation relating VIL and the echo tops that give the potential for surface gust using this concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Stewart |first=S.R. |publisher= NOAA |title=The prediction of pulse-type thunderstorm gusts using vertically integrated liquid water content (VIL) and the cloud top penetrative downdraft mechanism |series=Technical Memorandum, NWS SR-136 |year=1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a predictive result that gives a certain lead time. With the Doppler velocity data, the meteorologist can see the downdraft and [[gust front]]s happening, but since this a small scale feature, detection algorithms have been developed to point convergence and divergence areas under a thunderstorm on the radar display.

== Satellite imagery ==
[[File:40723Z IRsat.jpg|left|thumb|Infrared weather satellite image at 23Z 7 April 2006 associated with a [[April 6–8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak|significant tornado outbreak]] in the eastern United States with arrows pointing to the enhanced-v signatures.]]

Most populated areas of the earth are now well covered by [[weather satellite]]s, which aid in the [[Weather forecasting#Nowcasting|nowcasting]] of severe convective and tornadic storms.&lt;ref name="environment Canada detection"/&gt;  These images are available in the [[Visible spectrum|visible]] and [[infrared]] domains. The infrared (IR: 10-13 [[Micrometre|µm]]) images permit estimation of the top height of the clouds, according to the [[air mass]] soundings of the day, and the visible (VIS: 0.5-1.1&amp;nbsp;µm) ones will show the shape of the storms by its brightness and shadow produced. Meteorologists can extract information about the development stage and subsequent traits of thunderstorms by recognizing specific signatures in both domains. Visible imagery permits the most detailed imagery whereas infrared imagery has the advantage of availability at night. Sensors on satellites can also detect emissions from water vapor (WV: 6-7&amp;nbsp;µm), but mostly in the middle to upper levels of the [[troposphere]], so thunderstorms are only seen after being well developed. It is, however, useful in [[convective storm prediction]], as it illustrates the placement and movement of air masses and of moisture, as well as [[Shortwave (meteorology)|shortwaves]] and areas of vorticity and lift.

Severe storms have a very strong [[updraft]].  The rising air parcels in that column accelerate and will overshoot the [[equilibrium level]] before being pulled back by negative buoyancy.  This mean the cloud tops will reach higher levels than the surrounding cloud in the updraft region.  This [[overshooting top]] will be noticeable by a colder temperature region in the thunderstorm on infrared images.  Another signature associated with this situation is the Enhanced-V feature where the cold [[cloud top]]s forming at the overshooting top fan out in a V shape as cloud matter is blown downwind at that level.&lt;ref name = "Enhanced-V"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Brunner |first= Jason C. |author2=S.A. Ackerman |author3=A.S. Bachmeier |author4=R.M. Rabin |title = A Quantitative Analysis of the Enhanced-V Feature in Relation to Severe Weather |journal = Weather Forecast. |volume = 22 |issue = 4 |pages = 853–72 |date=Aug 2007 |doi = 10.1175/WAF1022.1 |bibcode = 2007WtFor..22..853B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both features can be seen on visible satellite imagery, during daytime, by the shadows they cast on surrounding clouds.

In [[Multicellular thunderstorm|multicellular]] storms and [[squall line]]s, the mid-level [[jet stream]] is often intersecting the line and its dry air introduced into the cloud is negatively unstable.  This results in a drying of the cloudy air in the region where the jet plunge groundward. On the back edge of the line, this shows as clear notches where one can find stronger [[downdraft]]s at the surface.  These kind of lines will have a very characteristic undulating pattern caused by the interference of the gusts fronts coming from different parts of the line.

Finally, in any type of thunderstorms, the surface cold pool of air associated the downdraft will stabilize the air and form a cloud free area which will end along the [[Outflow boundary|gust front]]. This mesoscale front, when moving into a warm and unstable air mass, will lift it and [[cumulus cloud]]s appear on satellite pictures. This line is likely the point of further convection and storms. One can notice it at the leading edge of a squall line, in the southeastern quadrant of a typical supercell (in the northern hemisphere), or different regions around other thunderstorms. They may also be visible as an [[outflow boundary]] hours or days after convection and can pinpoint areas of favored thunderstorm development, possible direction of movement, and even likelihood for tornadoes. The speed of forward movement of the outflow boundary or gust front to some degree modulates the likelihood of tornadoes and helps determine whether a storm will be enhanced by its presence or the inflow be choked off thus weakening and possibly killing the storm.  Thunderstorms may move along slow moving or stationary outflow boundaries and tornadoes are more likely; whereas fast moving gust fronts in many cases weaken thunderstorms after impact and are less likely to produce tornadoes—although brief tornadoes may occur at the time of impact. Fast moving gust fronts may eventually decelerate and become slow moving or stationary outflow boundaries with the characteristic "agitated area" of cumulus fields previously mentioned.

== Lightning detection ==
{{Main|Lightning detector}}

Usually in conjunction with data sources such as weather radar and satellites, lightning detection systems are sometimes utilized to pinpoint where thunderstorms are occurring (and to identify [[lightning]] hazard). Currently, most lightning data provided in real-time is from terrestrial sources, specifically, networks of ground-based sensors, although airborne sensors are also in operation. Most of these only provide latitude &amp; longitude, time, and polarity of cloud-to-ground strikes within a limited range. Increasing in sophistication and availability, and affording data for a very wide area, are satellite-based lightning detectors which initially included optical sensors indicating flash rates and horizontal location but now [[radio frequency]] receivers that can identify intra-cloud flashes with the addition of altitude, as well.

Lightning data is useful in suggesting intensity and organization of convective cells as well trends in thunderstorm activity (particularly growth, and to a lesser degree, decay). It is also useful in the early stages of thunderstorm development.  This was especially true when visible and infrared satellite data was delayed, but continues to be useful in detecting thunderstorms in stages of development before there is a substantial radar signature or for areas where radar data is lacking. Coming advances in research and observations should improve forecasts of severe weather and increase warning time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Schultz |first = Christopher J. |author2=W.A. Peterson |author3=L.D. Carey |title = Lightning and Severe Weather: A Comparison between Total and Cloud-to-Ground Lightning Trends |journal = Weather Forecast. |volume = 26 |issue = 5 |pages = 744–55 |date = Oct 2011 |doi = 10.1175/WAF-D-10-05026.1 |bibcode = 2011WtFor..26..744S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal lightning detection systems are also available, which may provide strike time, azimuth, and distance. In addition, [[lightning prediction system]]s are available and used mostly by parks and other outdoor recreational facilities, or meteorologists contracted to provide weather information for them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15317">'''Crystal Field Theory''' ('''CFT''') is a [[chemical bonding model|model]] that describes the breaking of [[degenerate energy levels|degeneracies]] of electron orbital states, usually d or f orbitals, due to a static electric field produced by a surrounding charge distribution (anion neighbors).  This theory has been used to describe various spectroscopies of [[transition metal]] [[complex (chemistry)|coordination complexes]], in particular optical spectra (colors).  CFT successfully accounts for some [[magnetic]] properties, colors, [[hydration reaction|hydration]] [[enthalpy|enthalpies]], and [[spinel]] structures of transition metal complexes, but it does not attempt to describe bonding.  CFT was developed by physicists [[Hans Bethe]] and [[John Hasbrouck van Vleck]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Vleck | first1 = J. | title = Theory of the Variations in Paramagnetic Anisotropy Among Different Salts of the Iron Group | journal = Physical Review | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 208–215 | year = 1932 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.41.208|bibcode = 1932PhRv...41..208V }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1930s.  CFT was subsequently combined with [[molecular orbital theory]] to form the more realistic and complex [[ligand field theory]] (LFT), which delivers insight into the process of [[chemical bonding]] in transition metal complexes.

==Overview of crystal  field theory==
According to crystal field theory, the interaction between a transition metal and [[ligand]]s arises from the attraction between the positively charged metal cation and negative charge on the non-bonding electrons of the ligand.  The theory is developed by considering energy changes of the five [[Degenerate orbital|degenerate]] [[Atomic orbital|''d''-orbitals]] upon being surrounded by an array of point charges consisting of the ligands. As a ligand approaches the metal ion, the electrons from the ligand will be closer to some of the ''d''-orbitals and farther away from others, causing a loss of degeneracy. The electrons in the ''d''-orbitals and those in the ligand repel each other due to repulsion between like charges. Thus the d-electrons closer to the ligands will have a higher energy than those further away which results in the ''d''-orbitals splitting in energy. This splitting is affected by the following factors:

*the nature of the metal ion.
*the metal's oxidation state. A higher oxidation state leads to a larger splitting relative to the spherical field.
*the arrangement of the ligands around the metal ion.
*the coordination number of the metal (i.e. tetrahedral, octahedral...)
*the nature of the ligands surrounding the metal ion. The stronger the effect of the ligands then the greater the difference between the high and low energy  ''d'' groups.

The most common type of complex is [[octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]]; here six ligands form an octahedron around the metal ion. In octahedral symmetry the ''d''-orbitals split into two sets with an energy difference, Δ&lt;sub&gt;oct&lt;/sub&gt; (the [[crystal-field splitting parameter]]) where the ''d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''d&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbitals will be lower in energy than the ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, which will have higher energy, because the former group is farther from the ligands than the latter and therefore experiences less repulsion. The three lower-energy orbitals are collectively referred to as '''t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;''', and the two higher-energy orbitals as '''e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'''. (These labels are based on the theory of [[molecular symmetry]]). Typical orbital energy diagrams are given below in the section High-spin and low-spin.

Tetrahedral complexes are the second most common type; here four ligands form a tetrahedron around the metal ion. In a tetrahedral crystal field splitting, the ''d''-orbitals again split into two groups, with an energy difference of Δ&lt;sub&gt;tet&lt;/sub&gt;. The lower energy orbitals will be ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, and the higher energy orbitals will be ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''xy''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''xz''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''yz''&lt;/sub&gt; - opposite to the octahedral case. Furthermore, since the ligand electrons in tetrahedral symmetry are not oriented directly towards the ''d''-orbitals, the energy splitting will be lower than in the octahedral case. [[Square planar molecular geometry|Square planar]] and other complex geometries can also be described by CFT.

The size of the gap Δ between the two or more sets of orbitals depends on several factors, including the ligands and geometry of the complex. Some ligands always produce a small value of Δ, while others always give a large splitting. The reasons behind this can be explained by [[ligand field theory]]. The [[spectrochemical series]] is an empirically-derived list of ligands ordered by the size of the splitting Δ that they produce (small Δ to large Δ; see also [[ligand#Examples of common ligands (by field strength)|this table]]):

[[iodide|I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt; [[bromide|Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt; [[sulfide|S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt; [[thiocyanate|SCN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] (S–bonded) &lt; [[chloride|Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;  [[nitrate|NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt; [[azide|N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt; [[fluoride|F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt; [[hydroxide|OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt; [[oxalate|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt; [[water (molecule)|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] &lt; [[isothiocyanate|NCS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] (N–bonded) &lt; [[acetonitrile|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN]] &lt; [[pyridine|py]] &lt;  [[ammonia|NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] &lt; [[ethylenediamine|en]] &lt; [[bipy|2,2'-bipyridine]] &lt; [[phenanthroline|phen]] &lt; [[nitrite|NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt; [[triphenylphosphine|PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] &lt; [[cyanide|CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;  [[carbon monoxide|CO]].

It is useful to note that the ligands producing the most splitting are those that can engage in metal to ligand [[Pi backbonding|back-bonding]].

The oxidation state of the metal also contributes to the size of Δ between the high and low energy levels.  As the oxidation state increases for a given metal, the magnitude of Δ increases.  A V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complex will have a larger Δ than a V&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complex for a given set of ligands, as the difference in charge density allows the ligands to be closer to a V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion than to a V&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion. The smaller distance between the ligand and the metal ion results in a larger Δ, because the ligand and metal electrons are closer together and therefore repel more.

===High-spin and low-spin===

[[File:CFT-Low Spin Splitting Diagram-Vector.svg|thumb|right|250px|'''Low Spin''' [Fe(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; crystal field diagram]]

Ligands which cause a large splitting Δ of the [[Atomic orbital|''d''-orbitals]] are referred to as strong-field ligands, such as CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and CO from the [[spectrochemical series]]. In complexes with these ligands, it is unfavourable to put electrons into the high energy orbitals. Therefore, the lower energy orbitals are completely filled before population of the upper sets starts according to the [[Aufbau principle]]. Complexes such as this are called "low spin". For example, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is a strong-field ligand and produces a large Δ. The octahedral ion [Fe(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;, which has 5 ''d''-electrons, would have the octahedral splitting diagram shown at right with all five electrons in the ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2''g''&lt;/sub&gt; level. The low spin state therefore does not follow [[Hund's rule]].

[[Image:CFT-High Spin Splitting Diagram-Vector.svg|thumb|right|250px|'''High Spin''' [FeBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; crystal field diagram]]

Conversely, ligands (like I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) which cause a small splitting Δ of the ''d''-orbitals are referred to as weak-field ligands. In this case, it is easier to put electrons into the higher energy set of orbitals than it is to put two into the same low-energy orbital, because two electrons in the same orbital repel each other. So, one electron is put into each of the five ''d''-orbitals before any pairing occurs in accord with Hund's rule and "high spin" complexes are formed. For example, Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is a weak-field ligand and produces a small Δ&lt;sub&gt;oct&lt;/sub&gt;. So, the ion [FeBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;, again with five ''d''-electrons, would have an octahedral splitting diagram where all five orbitals are singly occupied.

In order for low spin splitting to occur, the energy cost of placing an electron into an already singly occupied orbital must be less than the cost of placing the additional electron into an e&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; orbital at an energy cost of Δ. As noted above, e&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; refers to the
''d''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; which are higher in energy than the t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; in octahedral complexes. If the energy required to pair two electrons is greater than Δ, the energy cost of placing an electron in an e&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;, high spin splitting occurs.

The crystal field splitting energy for tetrahedral metal complexes (four ligands) is referred to as Δ&lt;sub&gt;tet&lt;/sub&gt;, and is roughly equal to 4/9Δ&lt;sub&gt;oct&lt;/sub&gt; (for the same metal and same ligands). Therefore, the energy required to pair two electrons is typically higher than the energy required for placing electrons in the higher energy orbitals. Thus, tetrahedral complexes are usually high-spin.

The use of these splitting diagrams can aid in the prediction of  magnetic properties of coordination compounds. A compound that has unpaired electrons in its splitting diagram will be paramagnetic and will be attracted by magnetic fields, while a compound that lacks unpaired electrons in its splitting diagram will be diamagnetic and will be weakly repelled by a magnetic field.

==Crystal field stabilization energy==

The crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE) is the stability that results from placing a transition metal ion in the crystal field generated by a set of ligands. It arises due to the fact that when the [[Atomic orbital|''d''-orbitals]] are split in a ligand field (as described above), some of them become lower in energy than before with respect to a spherical field known as the barycenter in which all five ''d''-orbitals are degenerate. For example, in an octahedral case, the ''t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;'' set becomes lower in energy than the orbitals in the barycenter. As a result of this, if there are any electrons occupying these orbitals, the metal ion is more stable in the ligand field relative to the barycenter by an amount known as the CFSE. Conversely, the ''e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbitals (in the octahedral case) are higher in energy than in the barycenter, so putting electrons in these reduces the amount of CFSE.

[[File:Crystal Field Splitting 4.png|thumb|right|500px|Octahedral crystal field stabilization energy]]

If the splitting of the ''d''-orbitals in an octahedral field is Δ&lt;sub&gt;oct&lt;/sub&gt;, the three ''t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbitals are stabilized relative to the barycenter by &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; Δ&lt;sub&gt;oct&lt;/sub&gt;, and the ''e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbitals are destabilized by &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; Δ&lt;sub&gt;oct&lt;/sub&gt;. As examples, consider the two ''d''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; configurations shown further up the page. The low-spin (top) example has five electrons in the ''t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbitals, so the total CFSE is 5 x &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; Δ&lt;sub&gt;oct&lt;/sub&gt; = 2Δ&lt;sub&gt;oct&lt;/sub&gt;. In the high-spin (lower) example, the CFSE is (3 x &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; Δ&lt;sub&gt;oct&lt;/sub&gt;) - (2 x &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; Δ&lt;sub&gt;oct&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0 - in this case, the stabilization generated by the electrons in the lower orbitals is canceled out by the destabilizing effect of the electrons in the upper orbitals.

===Optical properties===
The optical properties (details of absorption and emission spectra) of many [[coordination complex]]es can be explained by Crystal Field Theory.  Often, however, the deeper colors of metal complexes arise from more intense [[Charge-transfer complex|charge-transfer excitations]].&lt;ref name=MTarr2nd&gt;G. L. Miessler and D. A.

[[File:Stainless steel Cutthroat flume.jpg|thumb|Stainless steel Cutthroat flume]]The '''Cutthroat flume''' is a class of flow measurement [[flume]] developed during 1966/1967 that is used to measure the [[volumetric flow rate|flow]] of surface waters, sewage flows, and industrial discharges.  Like other [[flume]]s, the Cutthroat flume is a fixed [[hydraulic structure]].  Using vertical sidewalls throughout, the flume accelerates flow through a contraction of sidewalls until the flow reaches the "throat" of the flume, where the flow is then expanded.  Unlike the [[Parshall flume]], the Cutthroat flume lacks a parallel-walled throat section and maintains a flat floor throughout the flume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.iwmi.org/pdf/H019735.pdf |title=Converting a Fabricated Cutthroat Flume Into a Discharge Measuring Instrument |publisher=International Irrigation Management Institute |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the Cutthroat flume is standardized but not covered by a national or international standard (unlike the [[Parshall flume]]).  The flumes are not patented and the discharge tables are not copyright protected.

A total of 16 standard sizes of Cutthroat flumes have been developed, covering flow ranges from 0.3536 gpm [0.0223 l/s] to 54,801 gpm [3,458 l/s].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openchannelflow.com/flumes/cutthroat-flumes |title=Cutthroat Flumes for Flow Measurement |publisher=Openchannelflow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free-flow equation ==

Under free-flow conditions the depth of water at specified location upstream of the flume throat can be converted to a rate of flow.

The free-flow discharge can be summarized as &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceaeq.gouv.qc.ca/documents/publications/echantillonnage/debit_conduit_ouv_C7_ang.pdf |title=Sampling Guide for Environmental Analysis |publisher=Centre d'expertise en analyse environnementale du Quebec |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423024508/http://www.ceaeq.gouv.qc.ca/documents/publications/echantillonnage/debit_conduit_ouv_C7_ang.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q = C H^n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C = K W^{1.025}&lt;/math&gt;

Where
* ''Q'' is flow rate
* "C" is the free-flow coefficient 
* ''K'' is the free-flow length coefficient for the flume
* ''H'' is the head at the primary point of measurement
* ''n'' is the free-flow exponent
* "W" is the throat width

Both “K” and “n” vary by flume length alone.

== Submergence ==

Submergence transitions for Cutthroat flumes varies by flume length:
*60% for 18-inches long 
*65% for 36-inches long 
*70% for 54-inches long
*80% for 108-inches long

The submergence transition values for Cutthroat flumes are generally better than those for similarly sized Parshall flumes – an advantage in flat gradient channels where downstream hydraulics may increase the submergence ratio in the flume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cutthroat Flume Submergence|url=http://openchannelflow.com/flumes/cutthroat-flumes/submergence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Parshall flume, the secondary point of measurement, Hb, in the Cutthroat flume is located away from the throat section, making the determination of the level relatively easy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hb Location in Cutthroat Flumes|url=http://openchannelflow.com/blog/installing-a-cuthroat-flume-for-submerged-flow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

The Cutthroat flume was developed during the 1966-67s at the Utah Water Research Laboratory, Utah State, Logan, Utah by Skogerboe,Hyatt, Anderson, and Eggleston.  The result of these efforts was a flume that is simple in form and construction and that is well suited for use in flat gradient (low slope) applications.

== Design ==

Cutthroat flumes lack a parallel-wall throat section (hence the name) and has a flat-bottom to allow for installation in flat gradient channels.  From the top, the Cutthroat flume has an hourglass look similar to the Parshall flume, with which it is sometimes confused.

The walls of a Cutthroat flume are vertical, like [[Parshall flume|Parshall]] and HS / H / HL flumes.  The approach section walls contract uniformly at a 3:1 ratio, while the discharge section walls expand at a 6:1 ratio.  The point at with the approach and discharge section walls meet is termed the “throat” of the Cutthroat flume.

The primary point of measurement, Ha, occurs at a point upstream of the flume throat and can be determined by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;H_a = 2L / 9&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''L'' is flume length.

The secondary point of measurement, Hb, occurs at a point downstream of the flume throat and can be determined by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;H_b = 5L / 9&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''L'' is flume length.

== Advantages ==

*The simplicity of the Cutthroat flume’s geometry is such that it can be fabricated in a wide variety of materials, including [[concrete]], galvanized steel, sheet [[polycarbonate]], stainless steel, wood (temporary applications), or [[fiberglass]], as the application requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterrights.utah.gov/distinfo/measurement_devices.pdf |title=Flow Measurement Devices |publisher=Utah Division of Water Rights |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The geometry of the Cutthroat flume is the same among different lengths of Cutthroat flumes.  The angle of contraction in the inlet section and the angle of expansion in the outlet section are the same for all Cutthroat flumes.
*As the free-flow coefficient (K) and the free-flow exponent (n) depend only upon flume length, intermediate sizes Cutthroat flumes can be developed without the need for laboratory verification.
*The flat-bottomed design means that the flume can be retrofitted into existing channels without the need to raise the flume or adjust the downstream hydraulics.
*Provided the throat width is large enough, with its flat-bottomed design, the Cutthroat flume passes sediment and debris quite easily.

== Disadvantages ==

* Difficulty in replicating the flow characteristics of the initial research has led some researchers from recommending the Cutthroat flume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discharge Measurement Structures, Third Edition, Publication 20|url=http://content.alterra.wur.nl/Internet/webdocs/ilri-publicaties/publicaties/Pub20/pub20-h7.0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*As with [[weir]]s, [[flume]]s can also have an effect on local fauna. Some species or certain life stages of the same species may be blocked by flumes due to relatively slow swim speeds or behavioral characteristics. 
* In earthen channels, upstream bypass and downstream scour may occur.
* Cutthroat flumes with throat widths below 3-inches in size should not be used on unscreened sanitary flows due to the likelihood of clogging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't Get Stuck:  Sanitary Flows in Flumes|url=http://www.openchannelflow.com/blog/article/dont-get-stuck-sanitary-flows-in-flumes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standard sizes ==

Four standard lengths of the Cutthroat flume have been developed, with four throat widths for each length.

Below are the standard flume lengths with their respective standard throat widths.

*18-inches
**1-inch, 2-inches, 4-inches, 8-inches
*36-inches
**2-inches, 4-inches, 8-inches, 16-inches
*54-inches
**3-inches, 6-inches, 12-inches, 24-inches
*108-inches
**12-inches, 24-inches, 48-inches, 72-inches

For a given length, Cutthroat flumes of intermediate throat widths can be developed without the need for laboratory testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Custom Size Cutthroat Flumes|url=http://openchannelflow.com/blog/custom-size-cutthroat-flumes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q = C W H^n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C = 6.585 L^{-0.3310} W^{1.025}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n = 2.0936L^{-0.1225} - 0.128 (W/L)&lt;/math&gt;

Where
* ''Q'' is flow rate
* "C" is the free-flow coefficient 
* ''H'' is the head at the primary point of measurement
* ''n'' is the free-flow exponent
*"W" is the throat width
*"L" is the flume length

== Installation ==

As with the [[Parshall flume]], the initial applications for Cutthroat flumes were envisioned to be measuring flows in irrigation channels and other surface waters.

Again, like the Parshall flume, the Cutthroat flume has proven to be applicable to a range of open channel flows including:

*Irrigation channels and ditches
*Furrows
*Surface waters (swales, creeks, streams, and rivers)
*Elevated, above grade piped flows
*Below grade piped flows (concrete vaults / manholes incorporated into [[Packaged Metering Manhole]]s

The '''deben''' was an ancient Egyptian weight unit.

==Old and Middle Kingdom==
[[File:Market scene from the Old Kingdom of Egypt.jpg|thumb|right|Old Kingdom market scene: Two of the customers are seen carrying little boxes on their shoulders, suspected to have contained pieces of metal used as payment]]
Stone weights from the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] have been found, weighing about 13.6 [[gram]]s. Similar weights from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] were discovered at [[Lisht]]. From the Middle Kingdom date also ''deben'' weight units used for metals, referred to as [[copper]] deben and [[gold]] deben, the former being about twice as heavy (c. 23.7 grams) as the latter.

==New Kingdom==
From the [[New Kingdom]] one ''deben'' was equal to about 91 grams. It was divided into ten ''kidet'' (alt. ''kit'', ''kite'' or ''qedet''),&lt;ref&gt;Robert Steven Bianchi, ''Daily Life of the Nubians'', Greenwood Press 2004, {{ISBN|0-313-32501-4}} p.270&lt;/ref&gt; or into what is referred to by [[Egyptologist]]s  as 'pieces', one twelfth of a ''deben'' weighing 7.6 grams.&lt;ref&gt;Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards, ''The Cambridge Ancient History'',  Cambridge University Press 1973, {{ISBN|0-521-08230-7}},  p.389&lt;/ref&gt; It was frequently used to denote value of goods, by comparing their worth to a weight of metal, generally [[silver]] or copper.

==Protocurrency==
It has been speculated that pieces of metal weighing a deben were kept in boxes,&lt;ref&gt;George A. Reiser, "The Household Furniture of Queen Hetep-heres I", ''BMFA'' 27, No. 164, December 1929, pp. 83-90&lt;/ref&gt; taken to markets,&lt;ref&gt;R. Lepsius, ''Denkmäler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien'', Abth. II, Bl.96&lt;/ref&gt; and were used as a means of exchange.&lt;ref&gt;T. G. H. James, ''Pharaoh's People: Scenes from Life in Imperial Egypt'', Tauris Parke Paperbacks 2007, {{ISBN|1-84511-335-7}}, p.245&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have been unable to find any such standardized pieces of precious metal. On the other hand, it is documented that ''debens'' served to compare values. In the [[19th Dynasty]], a slave girl priced four deben and one kite of silver was paid for with various goods: 6 bronze vessels, 10 ''deben'' of copper, 15 linen garments, a shroud, a blanket, and a pot of honey.&lt;ref&gt;Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards, ''The Cambridge Ancient History, Vol 2, pt 1'',  Cambridge University Press 1973, {{ISBN|0-521-08230-7}},  p.390&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Debens appeared in the [[computer game]] ''[[Pharaoh (video game)|Pharaoh]]'' as its [[currency]] (in the form of [[gold]]).

'''Dolna Odra Power Station''' is a coal-fired power station at [[Nowe Czarnowo]] near [[Gryfino]] in [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship]], [[Poland]]. It consists of 8 units, 2 with 220&amp;nbsp;MW and 6 with 232&amp;nbsp;MW, which went in service between 1974 and 5 to 8 were awarded in 1977. Since 1993, Dolna Odra has gone through modernization process. In 2000, units 7 and 8 were equipped by new controls systems from [[Pavilion Technologies]] and [[ABB Group|ABB]]. Starting from October 2002, the flue gas from the units 5–8 is cleaned at the [[flue-gas desulfurization]] plant, built by [[Lurgi Lentjes]].&lt;ref name=lentjes&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  PGE also plans to build two new natural gas-fired units with capacity of 432&amp;nbsp;MW each.

Dolna Odra Power Station has three [[flue gas stack]]s: one with a height of {{convert|250|m}}, one with a height of {{convert|200|m}}, and one with a height of {{convert|170|m}}. A second {{convert|250|m}} tall flue gas stack was demolished in a non-explosive way after construction of a smoke cleaning facility, which uses the mentioned {{convert|200|m}} tall stack.

On 24 January 2010, an explosion of coal dust killed one employee and injured three. Part of a plant's coal supply system  
has been damaged.&lt;ref name=pge&gt;

==Location==
Drumlohan souterrain and ogham stones are located in farmland 4&amp;nbsp;km (2½ mi) east of [[Lemybrien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hannon |first=Ed |url=https://visionsofthepastblog.com/2016/10/03/drumlohan-ogham-stones-souterrain-waterford-ireland/ |title=Drumlohan Ogham Stones &amp; Souterrain, Waterford, Ireland &amp;#124; Visions Of The Past |website=Visionsofthepastblog.com |date=2016-10-03 |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ogham stones were carved between 400 and 700 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.megalithicmonumentsofireland.com/COUNTIES/WATERFORD/Dromlohan_OghamStones.html |title=Drumlohan Ogham Stones/Megalithic Monuments Of Ireland.Com |website=Megalithicmonumentsofireland.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The souterrain is believed to have been constructed around the 9th century AD and is aligned WSW, facing the setting sun. Souterrains were storage sites and places of refuge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prehistoricwaterford.com/products/drumlohan/ |title=Drumlohan |publisher=Prehistoric Waterford |date=2017-03-23 |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithomania.com/show/site/357/drumlohan_ogham_stones_ogham_stone.htm |title=Prehistoric and Early Ireland @ megalithomania.com - Drumlohan Ogham Stone, County Waterford |website=Megalithomania.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July/August 1867 a local farmer rediscovered the souterrain and ogham stones. In 1936 part of the souterrain was dismantled and some of the ogham stones re-erected above ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithicireland.com/Drumlohan%20Ogham%20Stones.html |title=Drumlohan Ogham Stones |website=Megalithicireland.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
===Souterrain===
This souterrain gallery is about 4.9&amp;nbsp;m (16&amp;nbsp;ft) long and 1.3&amp;nbsp;m (4&amp;nbsp;ft) wide, with a roof height of up to 1.2&amp;nbsp;m (4&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstones.org/place.aspx?p=995 |title=Drumlohan |website=Irishstones.org |date=2016-06-08 |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is constructed of [[orthostat]]s roofed with [[lintel]]s, and ten [[ogham]] stones were used as lintels and sidestones (some of them being installed upside-down).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irishantiquities.bravehost.com/waterford/drumlohan/drumlohan.html |title=Drumlohan |website=Irishantiquities.bravehost.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the roofstones bears [[cup marks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snap.waterfordcoco.ie/collections/ejournals/100754/100754-2.pdf |format=PDF |title=Old Waterford Society : Decies |date=1987 |website=Snap.waterfordcoco.ie |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ogham stones===
The stones (CIIC 272–281) vary in size. All are [[greenschist]], except for two of [[slate]] and one of [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]]. The inscriptions are:

'''Ebonol''' is a synthetic material whose name derives from its similarity in appearance, hardness, and stability to [[Ebony|ebony wood]]. Ebonol is used as a substitute for ebony in the construction of [[String instrument|stringed]] and [[woodwind]] instruments (specifically clarinets). The material is particularly well suited for the fingerboards of fretless bass.

Ebonol is technically known as "XXX Paper Phenolic" and is a high-pressure [[laminate]] made from layers of black [[paper]] and [[phenolic resin]]. {{citation needed||date=June 2016}}

An '''electric bicycle''', also known as an '''e-bike, powerbike''' or '''booster bike''', is a [[bicycle]] with an integrated [[electric motor]] which can be used for propulsion.  Many kinds of e-bikes are available worldwide, from e-bikes that only have a small motor to assist the rider's pedal-power (i.e., [[pedelec]]s) to somewhat more powerful e-bikes which tend closer to [[moped]]-style functionality: all, however, retain the ability to be [[Bicycle pedal|pedalled]] by the rider and are therefore not [[electric motorcycles]]. 

E-bikes use [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]] and the lighter ones can travel up to {{Convert|25|to|32|km/h|abbr=on}}, depending on local laws, while the more high-powered varieties can often do in excess of {{Convert|45|km/h|abbr=on}}.  In some markets, such as Germany {{asof|2013|lc=1}}, they are gaining in popularity and taking some market share away from conventional bicycles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electric Bikes Now Constitute 10 Percent of German Market 
 |url=http://www.evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=29891
 |work=EVworld.com |accessdate=3 April 2013 |deadurl=yes 
 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910022452/http://evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=29891 |archivedate=10 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in others, such as China {{asof|2010|lc=1}}, they are replacing [[fossil fuel]]-powered [[moped]]s and small motorcycles.&lt;ref name=NYT0110/&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday0210&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/environment/2010-02-11-electricbikes11_ST_N.htm
 |title=Electric bikes face long road in U.S.
 |publisher=[[USA Today]]|author=Kathy Chu
 |date=2010-02-12|accessdate=2010-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on local laws, many e-bikes (e.g., ''pedelecs'') are legally classified as bicycles rather than [[moped]]s or [[motorcycle]]s.  This exempts them from the more stringent laws regarding the certification and operation of more powerful two-wheelers which are often classed as [[electric motorcycles]].  E-bikes can also be defined separately and treated under distinct [[Electric bicycle laws]].

E-bikes are the [[electric motor]]-powered versions of [[motorized bicycle]]s, which have been in use since the late 19th century.  Some [[bicycle-sharing system]]s use them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ggwash.org/view/65501/its-not-a-bike-its-a-bike-shaped-uber-that-says-jump

==History==
[[File:Ebike1932.jpg|thumb|E-bike 1932 (by [[Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium|Philips]] &amp; Simplex)]]
In the 1890s, electric bicycles were documented within various U.S. patents. For example, on 31 December 1895, Ogden Bolton Jr. was granted {{US Patent|552271}} for a battery-powered bicycle with "6-pole brush-and-commutator direct current (DC) hub motor mounted in the rear wheel".  There were no gears and the motor could draw up to 100 amperes (A) from a 10-volt battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=DIVIAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=552,271|title=Patent US552271 – Electrical bicycle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, in 1897, Hosea W. Libbey of Boston invented an electric bicycle ({{US Patent|596272}}) that was propelled by a "double electric motor". The motor was designed within the hub of the [[crankset]] axle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=ZiZEAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=596272|title=Patent US596272 – Electric bicycle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model was later re-invented and imitated in the late 1990s by Giant Lafree e-bikes.

[[File:Electricbike1raleigh.JPG|thumb|A bike equipped with an after market electric hub motor conversion kit, with the battery pack placed on the rear carrier rack]]

By 1898 a rear-wheel drive electric bicycle, which used a [[Drive belt|driving belt]] along the outside edge of the wheel, was patented by Mathew J. Steffens.  Also, the 1899 {{US Patent|627066}} by John Schnepf depicted a rear-wheel friction “roller-wheel” style drive electric bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=F2JHAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=627,066|title=Patent US627066 – schnepf|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schnepf's invention was later re-examined and expanded in 1969 by G.A. Wood Jr. with his {{US Patent|3,431,994}}.  Wood’s device used 4 [[fractional horsepower motors]]; connected through a series of gears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=BFhrAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=3,431,994|title=Patent US3431994 – Electric drive for bicycles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Torque sensor]]s and [[power control]]s were developed in the late 1990s. For example, Takada Yutky of Japan filed a patent in 1997 for such a device.  In 1992 Vector Services Limited offered and sold an e-bike dubbed [[Sinclair Zike|Zike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zikebike.com/about.htm |title=Electric Bikes – Zike Bike Spares &amp; Sales |publisher=Zikebike.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424081452/http://www.zikebike.com/about.htm |archivedate=2009-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bicycle included NiCd batteries that were built into a frame member and included an 850&amp;nbsp;g permanent-magnet motor. Despite the Zike, in 1992 hardly any commercial e-bikes were available.

Production grew from 1993 to 2004 by an estimated 35%. By contrast, according to Gardner, in 1995 regular bicycle production decreased from its peak 107 million units.

Some of the less expensive e-bikes used bulky lead acid batteries, whereas newer models generally used NiMH, NiCd, and/or Li-ion batteries, which offered lighter, denser capacity batteries. Performance varies; however, in general there is an increase in range and speed with the latter battery types.

[[File:BLDCBicycleHubMotor.jpg|thumb|BLDC Bicycle Hub Motor]]

By 2001 the terms e-bike, power bike, "[[pedelec]]", pedal-assisted, and power-assisted bicycle were commonly used to refer to e-bikes. The terms "electric motorbike" or "e-motorbike" refer to more powerful models that attain up to {{convert|80|km/h|abbr=on}}.

In a parallel hybrid motorized bicycle, such as the aforementioned 1897 invention by Hosea W. Libbey, human and motor inputs are mechanically coupled either in the [[bottom bracket]], the rear wheel, or the front wheel, whereas in a (mechanical) series hybrid cycle, the human and motor inputs are coupled through differential gearing. In an (electronic) series hybrid cycle, human power is converted into electricity and is fed directly into the motor and mostly additional electricity is supplied from a battery.

By 2007 e-bikes were thought to make up 10 to 20 percent of all two-wheeled vehicles on the streets of many major Chinese cities.&lt;ref name=tim-johnson/&gt; A typical unit requires 8 hours to charge the battery, which provides the range of {{convert|25|to|30|mi}},&lt;ref name=tim-johnson/&gt; at the speed of around 20&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref name=fairley/&gt;

As of 2017, electric bicycles sales in the United States have slowed. This is due primarily to lower gas prices.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheap Gasoline Will Kill The Electric Car Again|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellynch/2016/01/14/will-low-gasoline-prices-whipsaw-the-auto-industry-again/|publisher=Forbes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classes ==

[[File:Schematic of an E-Bike.svg|thumb|Schematic of an E-Bike]]
[[File:Hyperbikes.jpg|thumb|right|Different types of e-bikes]]

E-bikes are classed according to the power that their electric motor can deliver and the control system, i.e., when and how the power from the motor is applied. Also the classification of e-bikes is complicated as much of the definition is due to [[#Legal status|legal reasons]] of what constitutes a bicycle and what constitutes a moped or motorcycle. As such, the classification of these e-bikes varies greatly across countries and local jurisdictions.

Despite these legal complications, the classification of e-bikes is mainly decided by whether the e-bike's motor assists the rider using a ''pedal-assist'' system or by a ''power-on-demand'' one. Definitions of these are as follows:
*With '''pedal-assist''' the electric motor is regulated by pedalling. The pedal-assist augments the efforts of the rider when they are pedalling. These e-bikes – called [[pedelec]]s – have a sensor to detect the pedalling speed, the pedalling force, or both. Brake activation is sensed to disable the motor as well.
*With '''power-on-demand''' the motor is activated by a [[throttle]], usually handlebar-mounted just like on most motorcycles or scooters.

Therefore, very broadly, e-bikes can be classed as:
* ''E-bikes with pedal-assist only'': either ''pedelecs'' (legally classed as bicycles) or ''S-Pedelecs'' (often legally classed as [[moped]]s)
** ''Pedelecs'': have pedal-assist only, motor assists only up to a decent but not excessive speed (usually 25&amp;nbsp;km/h), motor power up to 250 [[watt]]s, often legally classed as bicycles 
** ''S-Pedelecs'': have pedal-assist only, motor power can be greater than 250 watts, can attain a higher speed (e.g., 45&amp;nbsp;km/h) before motor stops assisting, legally classed as a moped or motorcycle ('''not''' a bicycle)
* ''E-bikes with power-on-demand'' and ''pedal-assist''
* ''E-bikes with power-on-demand only'': often have more powerful motors than pedelecs but not always, the more powerful of these are legally classed as mopeds or motorcycles

=== Pedal-assist only ===
E-bikes with pedal-assist only are usually called ''pedelecs'' but can be broadly classified into pedelecs proper and the more powerful S-Pedelecs.

==== Pedelecs ====
{{main|Pedelec}}

The term "[[pedelec]]" (from '''ped'''al '''ele'''ctric '''c'''ycle) refers to a ''pedal-assist'' e-bike with a relatively low-powered electric motor and a decent but not excessive top speed.  Pedelecs are legally classed as bicycles rather than low-powered motorcycles or mopeds.

The most influential definition of pedelecs and which are not comes from the [[European Union|EU]].  EU directive (EN15194 standard) for motor vehicles considers a bicycle to be a pedelec if:
# the ''pedal-assist'', i.e. the motorised assistance that only engages when the rider is pedalling, cuts out once 25&amp;nbsp;km/h is reached, and
# when the motor produces ''maximum continuous rated power'' of not more than 250 watts (n.b. the motor can produce more power for short periods, such as when the rider is struggling to get up a steep hill).
An e-bike conforming to these conditions is considered to be a pedelec in the EU and is legally classed as a [[bicycle]]. The EN15194 standard is valid across the whole of the EU and has also been adopted by some non-EU European nations and also some non-European jurisdictions (such as the [[state of Victoria]] in Australia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power assisted bicycles |url=http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/SafetyAndRules/SaferRiders/BikeRiders/PowerAssistedBicycles.htm
 |work=VicRoads website |publisher=[[VicRoads]] |accessdate=25 August 2013 |deadurl=yes
 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328200435/http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/SafetyAndRules/SaferRiders/BikeRiders/PowerAssistedBicycles.htm |archivedate=28 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedelecs are much like conventional bicycles in use and function — the electric motor only provides assistance, for example, when the rider is climbing or struggling against a headwind.  Pedelecs are therefore especially useful for people in hilly areas where riding a bike would prove too strenuous for many to consider taking up cycling as a daily means of transport.  They are also useful for riders who more generally need some assistance, e.g. for people with heart, leg muscle or knee joint issues.

==== S-Pedelecs ====
More powerful pedelecs which are not legally classed as bicycles are dubbed '''S-Pedelecs''' (short for ''Schnell-Pedelecs'', i.e. Speedy-Pedelecs) in Germany. These have a motor more powerful than 250 watts and less limited, or unlimited, pedal-assist, i.e. the motor does not stop assisting the rider once 25&amp;nbsp;km/h has been reached. S-Pedelec class e-bikes are therefore usually classified as [[moped]]s or motorcycles rather than as bicycles and therefore may (depending on the jurisdiction) need to be registered and insured, the rider may need some sort of driver's license (either car or motorcycle) and motorcycle helmets may have to be worn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Was Sie über den Versicherungsschutz von pedelecs wissen sollten|url=http://www.gdv.de/2012/08/was-sie-ueber-den-versicherungsschutz-von-pedelecs-wissen-sollten/|publisher=Gesamtverband der Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft (German Insurance Association)|language=German|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, many states have adopted S-Pedelecs into the Class 3 category. Class 3 ebikes are limited to &lt;=750 watts of power and 28&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;https://electricbikereview.com/guides/electric-bike-classes/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power-on-demand and pedal-assist ===
Some e-bikes combine both pedal-assist sensors as well as a throttle. An example of these is the ''eZee Torq''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=eZee electric bicycles: Torq |url=http://www.ezeebike.com/Torq_product.htm |accessdate=29 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411070758/http://www.ezeebike.com/Torq_product.htm |archivedate=11 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Adventure 24+ by BMEBIKES.&lt;ref name="www.bmebikes.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=www.bmebikes.com |url=http://www.bmebikes.com|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motor on this type of e-bike is activated by pushing the throttle or by pedaling.

=== Power-on-demand only ===
Some e-bikes have an electric motor that operates on a '''power-on-demand''' basis only. In this case, the electric motor is engaged and operated manually using a throttle, which is usually on the handgrip just like the ones on a motorbike or scooter. These sorts of e-bikes often, but not always, have more powerful motors than pedelecs do.

With ''power-on-demand only'' e-bikes the rider can:
# ride by pedal power alone, i.e. fully human-powered.
# ride by electric motor alone by operating the throttle manually.
# ride using both together at the same time.

Some power-on-demand only e-bikes can hardly be confused with, let alone categorised as, bicycles. For example, the ''Noped'' is a term used by the Ministry of Transportation of [[Ontario]] for e-bikes which do not have pedals or in which the pedals have been removed from their motorised bicycle. These are better categorised as electric [[moped]]s or [[electric motorcycle]]s.

== Technical ==

=== Motors and drivetrains ===
The two most common types of hub motors used in electric bicycles are brushed and brushless.  Many configurations are available, varying in cost and complexity; direct-drive and [[gear]]ed motor units are both used.  An electric power-assist system may be added to almost any pedal cycle using chain drive, belt drive, [[wheel hub motor|hub motor]]s or friction drive. [[Brushless DC electric motor|BLDC]] hub motors are a common modern design.  The motor is built into the wheel hub itself, and the stator fixed solidly to the axle, and the magnets attached to and rotating with the wheel.  The bicycle wheel hub is the motor.  The power levels of motors used are influenced by available legal categories and are often, but not always limited to under 750&amp;nbsp;watts.

Another type of electric assist motor, often referred to as the [[mid-drive]] system, is increasing in popularity. With this system, the electric motor is not built into the wheel but is usually mounted near (often under) the [[bottom bracket]] shell. In more typical configurations, a cog or wheel on the motor drives a belt or chain that engages with a pulley or sprocket fixed to one of the arms of the bicycle's [[crankset]]. Thus the propulsion is provided at the pedals rather than at the wheel, being eventually applied to the wheel via the bicycle's standard drive train.

Because the power is applied through the chain and sprocket, power is typically limited to around 250–500 watts to protect against fast wear on the drivetrain.  An electric mid-drive combined with an internal gear hub at the back hub may require care due to the lack of a [[clutch]] mechanism to soften the shock to the gears at the moment of re-engagement.  A [[continuously variable transmission]] or a fully automatic internal gear hub may reduce the shocks due to the viscosity of oils used for liquid coupling instead of the mechanical couplings of the conventional internal gear hubs.

===Batteries===
E-bikes use [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]], [[electric motor]]s and some form of control.   Battery systems in use include [[lead–acid battery|sealed lead-acid]] (SLA), [[Nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium]] (NiCad), [[Nickel-metal hydride battery|nickel-metal hydride]] (NiMH) or [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion polymer]] (Li-ion). Batteries vary according to the voltage, total charge capacity (amp hours), weight, the number of charging cycles before performance degrades, and ability to handle over-voltage charging conditions. The energy costs of operating e-bikes are small, but there can be considerable battery replacement costs. The lifespan of a battery pack varies depending on the type of usage. Shallow discharge/recharge cycles will help extend the overall battery life.

Range is a key consideration with e-bikes, and is affected by factors such as motor efficiency, battery capacity, efficiency of the driving electronics, aerodynamics, hills and weight of the bike and rider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  This is useful for extending the range and the life of brake pads and wheel rims.  There are also experiments using [[fuel cell]]s. e.g. the [[PHB (bicycle)|PHB]].
Some experiments have also been undertaken with [[electric double-layer capacitor|super capacitor]]s to supplement or replace batteries for cars and some SUVS.
E-bikes developed in Switzerland in the late 1980s for the [[Tour de Sol]] solar vehicle race came with [[solar power|solar]] [[charging station]]s but these were later fixed on roofs and connected so as to feed into the electric [[Mains electricity|mains]].&lt;ref&gt;Technisches "Reglement der Tour de Sol 1989/1990", published by Tour de Sol, Bern, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;  The bicycles were then charged from the mains, as is common today. While ebike batteries were produced mainly by bigger companies in past, many small to medium companies have started using innovative new methods for creating more durable batteries. State of the art, custom built automated precision CNC spot welding machines&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNfTEHBz_bg&lt;/ref&gt; created 18650 battery packs&lt;ref&gt;https://em3ev.com/shop/?product_cat=ebike-battery-parts&lt;/ref&gt; are commonly used among Do-it-yourself ebike makers.

===Controllers===
There are two distinct types of controllers designed to match either a [[Brushed DC electric motor|brushed motor]] or [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless motor]]. Brushless motors are becoming more common as the cost of controllers continues to decrease.  (See the page on [[DC motor]]s which covers the differences between these two types.)

''Controllers for brushless motors'': E-bikes require high initial torque and therefore models that use brushless motors typically have [[Hall sensor]] commutation for speed and angle measurement. An [[Electronic speed control|electronic controller]] provides assistance as a function of the sensor inputs, the vehicle speed and the required force. The controllers generally allow input by means of potentiometer or Hall Effect twist grip (or thumb-operated lever throttle), closed-loop speed control for precise speed regulation, protection logic for over-voltage, over-current and thermal protection. Bikes with a pedal assist function typically have a disc on the [[crank shaft]] featuring a ring of magnets coupled with a [[Hall sensor]] giving rise to a series of pulses, the frequency of which is proportional to pedaling speed. The controller uses [[pulse-width modulation|pulse width modulation]] to regulate the power to the motor. Sometimes support is provided for [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] but infrequent braking and the low mass of bicycles limits recovered energy. An implementation is described in an [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718160416/http://www.zilog.com/docs/z8encoremc/appnotes/AN0260.pdf application note] for a 200 W, 24 V Brushless DC (BLDC) motor.&lt;ref name=ElectricBikeBLDCHubMotorControl&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zilog.com/docs/z8encoremc/appnotes/AN0260.pdf |title=Electric Bike BLDC Hub Motor Control |publisher=Zilog, Inc |author=Zilog, Inc |year=2008 |accessdate=2010-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718160416/http://www.zilog.com/docs/z8encoremc/appnotes/AN0260.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Controllers for brushed motors'': Brushed motors are also used in e-bikes but are becoming less common due to their intrinsic lower efficiency. Controllers for brushed motors however are much simpler and cheaper due to the fact they don't require [[hall sensor]] feedback and are typically designed to be open-loop controllers. Some controllers can handle multiple voltages.

Some are designed to take the appearance of low capacity motorcycles, but smaller in size and consisting of an electric motor rather than a petrol engine. For example, the ''Sakura'' e-bike incorporates a 200&amp;nbsp;W motor found on standard e-bikes, but also includes plastic cladding, front and rear lights, and a speedometer. It is styled as a modern [[moped]], and is often mistaken for one.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Converting a non-electric bicycle to its electric equivalent can be complicated but numerous 'replace a wheel' solutions are now available on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/geoorbital-wheel/43097/|title=Tron-inspired electric bike wheel chucks the hub|website=www.gizmag.com|access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Other, rarer designs include that of a 'chopper' styled e-bike, which are designed as more of a 'fun' or 'novelty' e-bike than as a purposeful mobility aid or [[mode of transport]].

Electric [[cargo bike]]s allow the rider to carry large, heavy items which would be difficult to transport without electric power supplementing the human power input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electricbikereport.com/electric-cargo-bike-guide/ |title=Electric Cargo Bike Guide |publisher=Electric Bike Report |date=2010-09-01 |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various designs (including those mentioned above) are designed to fit inside most area laws, and the ones that contain pedals can be used on roads in the United Kingdom, among other countries.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

[[Folding bicycle|Folding]] e-bikes are also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sutton|first=Mark|title=EBCO introduces Solex electric bikes to the UK|url=http://www.bikebiz.com/index.php/news/read/ebco-introduces-solex-electric-bikes-to-the-uk/012429|accessdate=10 January 2012|newspaper=Bike Biz|date=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric [[self-balancing unicycle]]s do not conform to e-bike legislation in most countries and therefore cannot be used on the road,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/electric-gyroscopic-unicycle-is-like-a-segway-junior/8301-17938_105-20064007-1.html Electric Unicycle] by Amanda Kooser,  May 18, 2011, cnet.com&lt;/ref&gt; but can be utilized in the [[sidewalk]]. They are the cheapest electric cycles and used by the [[Last mile (transportation)|last mile commuters]], for urban use and to be combined with [[public transport]], including buses.

===Tricycles===
[[File:Modern Cargo Trike In London.jpg|thumb|A modern electric cargo trike in use in London, with a payload of up to 250kg]]

Electric trikes have also been produced that conform to the e-bike legislation. These have the benefit of additional low speed stability and are often favored by people with disabilities. Cargo carrying tricycles are also gaining acceptance, with a small but growing number of couriers using them for package deliveries in city centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bubblepost.be/|title=Bubble Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnewtcargo.co.uk/|title=Gnewt Cargo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latest designs of these trikes resemble a cross-between a pedal cycle and a small van.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Cargo-Trike.com|title=Cargo Trike}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/central/2013-11-20/electric-delivery-trikes-will-they-catch-on-in-britain/|title=Electric Delivery Trikes – will they catch on in Britain?|newspaper=ITV Central News|date=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health benefits ==
E-bikes can be a useful part of cardiac rehabilitation programmes, since health professionals will often recommend a stationary bike be used in the early stages of these. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes can reduce deaths in people with coronary heart disease by around 27%;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/exercise/pages/rehabilitation.aspx |title=Exercise – Rehabilitation – NHS Choices |publisher=Nhs.uk |date=2010-01-25 |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a patient may feel safer progressing from stationary bikes to e-bikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-articles.info/e/a/title/How-to-use-an-electric-bike-for-effective-cardio-rehabilitation/ |title=How To Use An Electric Bike For Effective Cardio Rehabilitation |publisher=E-articles.info |date=2006-09-29 |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They require less cardiac exertion for those who have experienced heart problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theelectricbikeco.com/electric_bicycles/rehabilitation-and-fitness |title=Rehabilitation and Fitness |publisher=Theelectricbikeco.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

E-bikes can also provide a source of exercise for individuals who have trouble exercising for an extended time (due to injury or excessive weight, for example) as the bike can allow the rider to take short breaks from pedaling and also provide confidence to the rider that they'll be able to complete the selected path without becoming too fatigued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mensfitness.com/life/gearandtech/why-you-need-electric-bike |title=Why You Need an Electric Bike |publisher=MensFitness.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; or without having forced their knee joints too hard (people who need to use their knee joints without wearing them out unnecessarily may in some electric bikes adjust the level of motor assistance according to the terrain). A University of Tennessee study provides evidence that energy expenditure (EE) and oxygen consumption (VO2) for e-bikes are 24% lower than that for conventional bicycles, and 64% lower than for walking. Further, the study notes that the difference between e-bikes and bicycles are most pronounced on the uphill segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://peopleforbikes.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1-s2.0-S2214140516303930-main.pdf|title=Comparing physical activity of pedal-assist electric bikes with walking and conventional bicycles|last=Langford|first=Brian Casey|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reaching VO2 Max, can really help your body as a whole&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.e-bikesdirect.co.uk/blog/get-back-in-the-saddle-electric-bikes|title=Electric Bikes and older riders - eBikes Direct|last=e-bikesdirect.co.uk|work=eBikes Direct|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Environmental effects==
E-bikes are [[zero-emissions vehicle]]s, as they emit no combustion by-products.  However, the environmental effects of [[electricity generation]] and [[electricity distribution|power distribution]] and of manufacturing and disposing of (limited life) high [[memory storage density|storage density]] batteries must be taken into account. Even with these issues considered, e-bikes are claimed to have a significantly lower environmental impact than conventional [[automobile]]s, and are generally seen as environmentally desirable in an urban environment.&lt;ref name="Cherry2015"&gt;{{cite journal

The environmental effects involved in recharging the batteries can of course be reduced. The small size of the battery pack on an e-bike, relative to the larger pack used in an [[electric car]], makes them very good candidates for charging via [[solar power]] or other renewable energy resources.  Sanyo capitalized on this benefit when it set up "solar parking lots", in which e-bike riders can charge their vehicles while parked under [[Photovoltaic module|photovoltaic panels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The environmental credentials of e-bikes, and electric / human powered hybrids generally, have led some municipal authorities to use them, such as [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] with their ''Wavecrest'' electric power-assisted bicycles or [[Cloverdale, California]] police with ''Zap'' e-bikes. China’s e-bike manufacturers, such as Xinri, are now partnering with universities in a bid to improve their technology in line with international environmental standards, backed by the Chinese government who is keen to improve the export potential of the Chinese manufactured e-bikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.articlesbase.com/international-business-articles/electric-bicycles-the-green-innovation-gaining-traction-in-world-export-markets-2420374.html |title=Electric Bicycles; the Green Innovation gaining traction in world export markets |publisher=Articlesbase.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both land management regulators and mountain bike trail access advocates have argued for bans of electric bicycles on outdoor trails that are accessible to mountain bikes, citing potential safety hazards as well as the potential for electric bikes to damage trails.

* 18 times more energy efficient than an SUV
* 13 times more energy efficient than a sedan
* 6 times more energy efficient than rail transit
* and, of about equal impact to the environment as a conventional bicycle.

One major concern is disposal of used [[Lead–acid battery|lead batteries]], which can cause environmental contamination if not recycled.&lt;ref name=NYT0110/&gt;

==Road traffic safety==
[[People's Republic of China|China]]'s experience, as the leading e-bike world market, has raised concerns about [[road traffic safety]] and several cities have considered banning them from [[bicycle lane]]s.&lt;ref name=NYT0110/&gt; As the number of e-bikes increased and more powerful motors are used, capable of reaching up to {{convert|30|mph|0}}, the number of traffic accidents have risen significantly in China. E-bike riders are more likely than a car driver to be killed or injured in a collision, and because e-bikers use conventional bicycle lanes they mix with slower-moving bicycles and pedestrians, increasing the risk of [[traffic collision]]s.&lt;ref name=NYT0110/&gt;

A 2008 market survey showed that the average distance traveled in the Netherlands by commuters on a standard bicycle is {{convert|6.3|km|mi}} while with an e-bike this distance increases to {{convert|9.8|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name=Market08&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fietsberaad.nl/index.cfm?lang=en&amp;section=Kennisbank&amp;mode=detail&amp;repository=Electric+bicycles+-+market+research+and+investigation|title=Electric bicycles – market research and investigation|author=Ingrid Hendriksen et. al|year=2008|publisher=Fiets Beraad|accessdate=2010-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This survey also showed that e-bike ownership is particularly popular among people aged 65 and over, but limited among commuters. The e-bike is used in particular for recreational bicycle trips, shopping and errands.&lt;ref name=Market08/&gt;

===United States===
In 2009 the U.S. had an estimated fleet of 200,000 e-bikes.&lt;ref name=AsiaT&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/LE07Cb01.html|title=China switches to e-bikes|publisher=Asia Times|date=2010-05-07|accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 they were increasingly favored in [[Cycling in New York City|New York]] as food delivery vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/nyregion/for-food-delivery-workers-speed-tips-and-fear-on-wheels.html?_r=2&amp;hp Food deliverymen on wheels] By J. DAVID GOODMAN, ''The New York Times'', March 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, two e-bike advocates completed the first {{convert|4000|mi|adj=on}} transcontinental e-bike tour from New York to San Francisco to advocate for e-bikes in major cities across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.triplepundit.com/2012/04/duo-ride-across-america-electric-bike-promote-awarenes/|title=TriplePundit.com|date=2012-04-17|accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pedego Electric Bikes is the best selling brand in the U.S.
Many e-bikes in the United States are standard bicycles converted using a kit. In general, the kits include the motor (the majority of which are hub motors built into the front or rear wheel), a speed controller, throttle (usually twist-grip or thumb throttle), necessary wiring and connectors, and a battery.  Several U.S. companies offer conversion kits which also offer advanced lithium battery packs.  Major manufacturers also offer complete e-bikes. Trek offers a line of e-bikes using the Bionx system in which the rider programs the controller to determine how much effort the motor will give in response to rider effort, from 25% up to 200% of the rider's power.  This system ensures a minimum level of rider participation and is also used to comply with many European laws mandating partial human effort before the motor engages.

One of the biggest headwinds facing electric bicycles in the United States has been lower fuel prices&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt; since the end of the [[2000s commodities boom]].

In the U.S. military's [[strategic nuclear weapon]] [[nuclear command and control]] (NC2) system, an '''Emergency Action Message''' ('''EAM''') is a preformatted message that directs nuclear-capable forces&lt;ref name="hfgcs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.numbers-stations.com/media/articles/EAMs.pdf |title=EAMs and HF-GCS |accessdate=2014-10-25 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to execute specific Major Attack Options (MAOs) or Limited Attack Options (LAOs) in a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. Individual countries or specific regions may be included or withheld in the EAM, as specified in the [[Single Integrated Operational Plan]] (SIOP). The SIOP was updated annually until February 2003, when it was replaced by [[Military operation plan|Operations Plan]] (OPLAN) 8044.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Kristensen |first = Hans M. |authorlink = Hans M. Kristensen |title = U.S. Changes Name of Nuclear War Plan |publisher = Nuclear Information Project |date = 21 December 2004 |url = http://www.nukestrat.com/us/stratcom/siopname.htm |accessdate = 13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since July 2012, the US nuclear war plan has been OPLAN 8010-12, ''Strategic Deterrence and Force Employment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Kristensen |first = Hans M. |title = US Nuclear War Plan Updated Amidst Nuclear Policy Review |publisher = [[Federation of American Scientists]] |date = April 4, 2013 |url = https://fas.org/blogs/security/2013/04/oplan8010-12/ |accessdate = June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
EAMs use [[cryptographic protocol]]s (including such methods as [[digital signature]]s) to authenticate the messages,&lt;ref name="hfgcs"/&gt; thereby ensuring that they cannot be forged or altered.

In the United States, the EAM will be issued from the [[National Military Command Center]] (NMCC) at [[the Pentagon]] or, if it has been destroyed by an enemy first strike, by the [[Raven Rock Mountain Complex|Alternate National Military Command Center - Site R]] at [[Raven Rock, Pennsylvania]] or by the [[Boeing E-4|Boeing E-4B National Airborne Operations Center]] (NAOC).

The messages are sent in digital format to nuclear-capable major commands via the secure Automatic Digital Network ([[AUTODIN]]). The messages are then relayed to aircraft that are on alert by the [[U.S. Strategic Command]] at [[Offutt Air Force Base]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], via [[single-sideband modulation]] radio transmitters of the [[High Frequency Global Communications System]] (formerly known as the Global High Frequency Service). The EAM is relayed to missile-firing nuclear submarines via special transmitters designed for [[communication with submarines]]. The transmitters include those designed to operate at [[Very Low Frequency]] (VLF). The submarines pick up the message via special antennas.  Nuclear-capable forces will then be expected to carry out an EAM without fail.  Manned bombers may be recalled, but missiles fired from land-based silos or from submarines cannot be recalled.

Skyking messages are also read on the same network as EAMs, also known as "Foxtrot Broadcasts". These messages will interrupt an EAM if needed to be read.  They contain a higher priority and time-sensitive code for orders that need immediate attention.&lt;ref name="hfgcs"/&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The EAM system was featured extensively and used as one of the primary plot devices in the feature film ''[[Crimson Tide (film)|Crimson Tide]]''.

'''Energy cannibalism''' refers to an effect where rapid growth of a specific energy producing industry creates a need for [[energy]] that uses (or cannibalizes) the energy of existing [[power plants]]. Thus during rapid growth the industry as a whole produces no new energy because it is used to fuel the [[embodied energy]] of future power plants.

==Theoretical underpinnings==
In order for an “emission free” power plant to have a net negative impact on the [[greenhouse gas emissions]] of the [[energy supply]] it must produce enough emission-less [[electricity]] to offset both greenhouse gas emissions that it is directly responsible for (e.g. from concrete used to construct a nuclear power plant) and to offset the greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generated for its construction (e.g. if coal is used to generate electricity while constructing a nuclear power plant). This can become challenging during rapid growth of the “emission free” technology because it may require the construction of additional power plants of the older technology simply to power the construction of the new “emission free” technology.

==Derivation==
First, all the individual power plants of a specific type can be viewed as a single  aggregate plant or ensemble and can be observed for its ability to mitigate emissions as it grows. This ability is first dependent on the [[energy payback time]] of the plant. Aggregate plants with a total installed capacity of &lt;math&gt;C_T&lt;/math&gt; (in GW) produces:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;E_T = t \cdot C_T = t \cdot \sum_{n=1}^N C_n&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

of electricity, where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (in hours per year) is the fraction of time the plant is running at full capacity, &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; is the capacity of individual power plants and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of plants. If we assume that the energy industry grows at a rate, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, (in units of 1/year, e.g. 10% growth = 0.1/year) it will produce additional capacity at a rate (in GW/year) of 

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;r \cdot C_T&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

After one year, the electricity produced would be 

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;r \cdot C_T \cdot 8760\,h&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

The time that the individual power plant takes to pay for itself in terms of energy it needs over its [[Enterprise life cycle|life cycle]], or the [[energy payback time]], is given by the principal energy invested (over the entire life cycle), &lt;math&gt;E_P&lt;/math&gt;, divided by energy produced (or fossil fuel energy saved) per year, &lt;math&gt;E_{ann}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus if the energy payback time of a plant type is &lt;math&gt;E_P/E_{ann}&lt;/math&gt;, (in years,) the energy investment rate needed for the sustained growth of the entire power plant ensemble is given by the cannibalistic energy, &lt;math&gt;E_{Can}&lt;/math&gt;:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;E_{Can} = \frac{E_P}{E_{ann}} \cdot r \cdot C_T \cdot t&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

The power plant ensemble will not produce any net energy if the cannibalistic energy is equivalent to the total energy produced. So by setting equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) equal to ({{EquationNote|4}}) the following results:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{E_P}{E_{ann}} \cdot r \cdot C_T \cdot t = C_T \cdot t&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

and by doing some simple algebra it simplifies to:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{E_P}{E_{ann}} = \frac{1}{r}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

So if one over the growth rate is equal to the energy payback time, the aggregate type of energy plant produces no [[net energy]] until growth slows down.

==Greenhouse gas emissions==
This analysis was for [[energy]] but the same analysis is true for  [[greenhouse gas emissions]]. The principle [[greenhouse gas emissions]] emitted in order to provide for the  power plant divided by the emissions offset every year must be equal to one over the growth rate of type of power to break even.

==Example==

For example, if the energy payback is 5 years and the capacity growth is 20%, no net energy is produced and no [[greenhouse gas emissions]] are offset if the only power input to the growth is fossil during the growth period.

==Applications to the nuclear industry==

In the article “Thermodynamic Limitations to Nuclear Energy Deployment as a Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Technology” the necessary growth rate, r, of the nuclear power industry was calculated to be 10.5%. This growth rate is very similar to the 10% limit due to [[energy payback]] example for the nuclear power industry in the United States calculated in the same article from a [[life cycle analysis]] for energy.

These results indicate that any energy policies with the intention of driving down [[greenhouse gas emissions]] with deployment of additional [[nuclear reactors]] will not be effective unless the nuclear energy industry in the U.S. improves its [[Efficient energy use|efficiency]]. 

Some of the energy input into nuclear power plants occurs as [[Environmental impact of concrete|production]] of [[concrete]], which consumes little electricity from power plants.

==Applications to other industries==
As with nuclear power plants, hydroelectric dams are built with large amounts of concrete, which equate to considerable CO2 emissions, but little power usage.&lt;ref name="ExternEGraphs"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://gabe.web.psi.ch/projects/externe_pol/index.html |title=External costs of electricity systems (graph format) |year=2005 |work=ExternE-Pol |publisher=Technology Assessment / GaBE ([[Paul Scherrer Institut]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long lifespan of hydroplants then contribute to a positive power ratio for a longer time than most other power plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reme.epfl.ch/webdav/site/reme/users/106542/public/SHS4/Gr01.pdf Hydropower – A Way of Becoming Independent of Fossil Energy?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528070938/http://reme.epfl.ch/webdav/site/reme/users/106542/public/SHS4/Gr01.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Solar power#Environmental impacts|environmental impact of solar power]], the energy payback time of a power generating system is the time required to generate as much energy as was consumed during production of the system. In 2000 the energy payback time of PV systems was estimated as 8 to 11 years&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Blakers and Klaus Weber, [http://www.ecotopia.com/apollo2/pvepbtoz.htm "The Energy Intensity of Photovoltaic Systems"], Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems, Australian National University, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006 this was estimated to be 1.5 to 3.5 years for crystalline silicon PV systems&lt;ref name="ECN2006"&gt;Alsema, E.A.; Wild - Scholten, M.J. de; Fthenakis, V.M.

[[File:Sir Francis Chichester portrait.jpg|thumb|Sir Francis Chichester]]
'''Sir Francis Charles Chichester''' [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|KBE]] (17 September 1901 – 26 August 1972) was a pioneering aviator and solo sailor.

He was knighted by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] for becoming the first person to sail [[single-handed sailing|single-handed]] around the world by the [[clipper route]] and the fastest [[circumnavigation|circumnavigator]], in nine months and one day overall in 1966–67.

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Old Rectory Shirwell 2017.jpg|thumb|right|The former Rectory in [[Shirwell]], birthplace of Francis Chichester photographed in 2017]]
Chichester was born in the rectory at [[Shirwell]] near [[Barnstaple]] in Devon, England, the son of a [[Church of England]] clergyman, Charles Chichester, himself the seventh son of [[Chichester baronets|Sir Arthur Chichester, 8th Baronet]].&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, Anita. ''Francis Chichester: A Biography''.  New York, Walker &amp; Co. 1975&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Emily Annie, daughter of Samuel Page. At the age of six he was sent as a [[boarding school|boarder]] to The Old Ride Preparatory School for boys, then attended [[Marlborough College]] during [[World War I]]. At the age of eighteen Chichester emigrated to New Zealand where in ten years he built up a prosperous business in forestry, mining and property development, only to suffer severe losses in the [[Great Depression]].

===Aviator===
After returning to England in 1929 to visit his family, Chichester took flying lessons at [[Brooklands]], Surrey, and qualified as a pilot. He then took delivery of a [[de Havilland Gipsy Moth]] aircraft, which he intended to fly to New Zealand, hoping to break [[Bert Hinkler]]'s record solo flight back to Australia on the way. While mechanical problems meant that the record eluded him, he completed the trip in 41 days. The aircraft was then shipped to New Zealand. Finding that he was unable to carry enough fuel to cross the [[Tasman Sea]] directly, Chichester had his Gipsy Moth fitted with floats borrowed from the [[New Zealand Permanent Air Force]], and went on to make the first solo flight across the Tasman Sea from East to West (New Zealand to Australia). He was the first to land an aircraft at [[Norfolk Island]] and [[Lord Howe Island]].  Again, the trip was delayed: after his aircraft was severely damaged at Lord Howe, he had to rebuild it himself with the help of islanders.

Though the concept of "off-course navigation" (steering to one side so you know which way the error is) is probably as old as navigation, Chichester was the first to use it in a methodical manner in an aircraft.  His only method of fixing his position was to take sun sights with a [[sextant]]. As a solo pilot, this was a difficult thing to do in a moving aircraft, as he needed to fly the aircraft at the same time.  After the sun sight was taken, he had to make calculations by long-hand. As all this could be unreliable, Chichester needed an alternative. When he reached a point at which the sun was at a calculated altitude above the horizon, the pilot then made a 90-degree turn to the left (or right as calculated) and then flew along this line until the destination was reached. Since he did not know in advance when he would arrive at a line of position passing through his destination, he calculated a table or graph of the Sun's altitude and [[azimuth]] at his destination for a range of times bracketing his ETA. The advantage of this method was that the effects of drift were reduced to errors in distance travelled, usually much smaller.  Since Chichester arrived at Lord Howe Island in the afternoon, the Sun was to his north-west when he made his turn.  Some hours before making his turn, close to local noon when the Sun was to his north, Chichester made two observations with his sextant to check his dead-reckoning course.&lt;ref name=PositionLineSlideRules&gt;{{cite web|last=van Riet|first=Ronald|title=Position Line Slide Rules|url=http://www.rechenschieber.org/PositionLineSlideRules.pdf|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general principle was, when the Sun is to the right or left of one's course one can check the course but not distance to the destination.  When the Sun is ahead or behind one's course, the distance to one's destination can be checked but not one's course.  Chichester planned his final approach to follow a line of position directly to his destination. This technique allowed him to find tiny islands in the Pacific. He was awarded the inaugural Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators Johnston Memorial Trophy for this trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gapan.org/about-the-guild/trophies-and-awards/award-winners/the-johnston-memorial-trophy/|title=The Johnston Memorial Trophy|accessdate=25 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201171738/http://www.gapan.org/about-the-guild/trophies-and-awards/award-winners/the-johnston-memorial-trophy/|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chichester then decided to circumnavigate the world solo; he made it to Japan but at [[Katsuura, Chiba|Katsuura]], Chiba he collided with an overhead cable, sustaining serious injuries.

===Second World War cartography===
Unable to join the [[Royal Air Force]] at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] due to age and eyesight,&lt;ref&gt;The Lonely Sea and the Sky&lt;/ref&gt; he was not granted a commission until 14 March 1941 when he joined the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]] for the duration of hostilities. His civil occupation was listed as Air Navigation Specialist. His first posting was to the Air Ministry in the Navigation section of the Directorate of Air Member Training, where he served until August 1942. In July 1943 he was sent to the [[Empire Central Flying School]] where he instructed in navigation until released in September 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Air Historical Branch (RAF)&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the navigation manual that allowed the pilots of single-handed fighter aircraft to navigate across Europe and back using kneeboard navigation similar to that which he had used in the Pacific.

At the end of the war, he stayed in the United Kingdom.  He purchased 15,000 surplus Air Ministry maps, initially pasting them onto boards and making [[jigsaw puzzle]]s out of them, and later founded his own successful map-making company.

===Yachtsman===
In 1958, Chichester was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. (This might have been a misdiagnosis; David Lewis, a London doctor, who competed against Chichester in the first solo trans-Atlantic race, reviewed his case and called Chichester's abnormality a "lung abscess".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, David. The Ship Would Not Travel Due West. London: St Martin's Press, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;) His wife Sheila put him on a strict vegetarian diet (now considered to be a [[macrobiotic]] diet) and his cancer went into remission. Chichester then turned to long-distance [[yacht]]ing.

In 1960, he entered and won the first [[single-handed sailing|single-handed]] [[Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race|transatlantic yacht race]], which had been founded by [[Herbert Hasler|'Blondie' Hasler]], in the yacht ''Gipsy Moth III''. He came second in the second race four years later.

On 27 August 1966 Chichester sailed his ketch ''[[Gipsy Moth IV]]'' from [[Plymouth]] in the United Kingdom and returned there after 226 days of sailing on 28 May 1967, having [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the globe, with one stop (in Sydney). By doing so, he became the first person to achieve a true [[Around the world sailing record|circumnavigation of the world]] solo from West to East via the [[great Capes]]. The voyage was also a race against the clock, as Chichester wanted to beat the typical times achieved by the fastest fully crewed [[clipper ship]]s during the heyday of commercial sail in the 19th century.

{{efn|The first recorded solo circumnavigation of the globe was achieved by '''[[Joshua Slocum]]''' in 1898 but it took him three years with numerous stops – Slocum also took up the harder challenge of sailing east to west, against the prevailing wind). Also, The Argentinian '''[[Vito Dumas]]''' is said to have circumnavigated in 1942-1943. '''[[Alec Rose|Sir Alec Rose]]''' completed a circumnavigation in 1967-1968.  In 1968–1969 '''[[Robin Knox-Johnston]]''' completed the '''first [[single-handed sailing|single-handed]] non-stop circumnavigation'''.}}

===Honours and later life===

In July 1967, a few weeks after his solo circumnavigation, Chichester was knighted, being appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] for "individual achievement and sustained endeavour in the navigation and seamanship of small craft".&lt;ref name="kbe-award" /&gt; For the ceremony, the Queen used the sword used by her predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] to knight the adventurer [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]], the first Englishman with his crew to complete a circumnavigation. ''Gipsy Moth IV'' was preserved alongside the ''[[Cutty Sark]]'' at [[Greenwich]].

Chichester was also honoured in 1967 by a newly issued 1/9d (one [[shilling]] and nine pence) postage stamp, which showed him aboard ''Gipsy Moth IV''.  This went against an unwritten tradition of the [[General Post Office]], because Chichester was neither a member of the royal family nor dead when the stamp was issued.

In 1968, when [[Donald Crowhurst]] was trying to win the [[Sunday Times Golden Globe Race]], a single-handed round-the-world event, it was Chichester who dismissed Crowhurst's wildly exaggerated reports of his own progress, which had fooled many enthusiastic supporters.

In 1970, Chichester attempted to sail 4,000 miles in twenty days, in ''Gipsy Moth V'', but failed by one day.

Francis Chichester died of cancer in [[Plymouth]], Devon, on 26 August 1972, and was buried in the church of his ancestors, [[Church of St Peter, Shirwell|St Peter's Church]] in [[Shirwell]], near [[Barnstaple]]. His widow died in 1989 and is buried with him.

==Family==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Sir Francis Chichester had two sons, George and Giles. His younger son, [[Giles Chichester]], was for many years a British politician, and Conservative Member of the [[European Parliament]] for South West England and [[Gibraltar]].

==''Gipsy Moth IV's'' restoration==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
By the early 2000s, the condition of ''Gipsy Moth IV'', even though it continued to rest in a Greenwich dry dock hoist, had seriously deteriorated.  Admirers of the vessel knew that she required a complete restoration if her life was to be extended.  A campaign was launched in 2003 by Paul Gelder, editor of ''Yachting Monthly'' magazine, to sail the yacht around the world a second time in observance of the 40th anniversary of Chichester's epic voyage (and coincidentally the 100th birthday of the magazine).

In November 2004 she was lifted out of Greenwich dry dock (which some had called the yacht's "grave") after being sold to the UK Sailing Academy in [[Cowes]], Isle of Wight, for a token £1 and a [[gin and tonic]], said to be Chichester's favourite tipple. The UKSA, ''Yachting Monthly'' and the Maritime Trust were the three major project partners in the bold campaign to save the yacht.  She was taken by road back to [[Camper &amp; Nicholson]], her original builders in [[Gosport]].

On 20 June 2005 ''Gipsy Moth IV'' was relaunched after a £400,000 refit with money raised by donations from the public, and equipment and services given by the British marine industry.  In September 2005 she embarked on a 21-month educational round-the-world voyage with the Blue Water Round the World Rally, via the trade wind route and the Panama and Suez Canals (not the Capes as had been followed in its first circumnavigation). In spring 2006, she ran aground on an atoll in the South Pacific.  An extensive restoration in Auckland was required to repair the yacht, which was successfully refloated in June 2006. After being accompanied into [[Plymouth]] by a flotilla of boats, ''Gipsy Moth IV'' docked at West Hoe Pier on 28 May 2007, as she had done exactly 40 years earlier, to complete her journey round the world.

The yacht's restoration and the second circumnavigation are described in Paul Gelder's 2007 book, ''Gipsy Moth IV: A Legend Sails Again''.

==Other posthumous honours==
[[File:9 St James's Place, London, September 2016 01.jpg|thumb|9 [[St James's Place]], London, September 2016]]

The English rock group [[Dire Straits]] pay tribute to the achievements of Sir Francis in their album track entitled ''Single Handed Sailor'', which is track No.8 (of 9) of their 1979 album, ''[[Communiqué (Dire Straits album)|Communiqué]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[Norfolk Island]] issued a stamp, in 1981, commemorating the first landing of an aircraft on the Island, Chichester's Gipsy Moth ''Mme Elijah'', at Cascade Bay on 28 March 1931. Another stamp (14 cents) was issued by Norfolk Island at a later date showing Chichester's seaplane.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

A memorial plaque to Chichester was unveiled at the family home at 9 [[St James's Place]], SW1 in September 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716210428/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |archivedate=16 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }} memorial plaque&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, a '''genus-two surface''' (also known as a '''double torus''' or '''two-holed torus''') is a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] formed by the [[connected sum]] of two [[torus|tori]]. That is to say, from each of two tori the interior of a disk is removed, and the boundaries of the two disks are identified (glued together), forming a double torus. 

This is the simplest case of the connected sum of ''n'' tori.  A connected sum of tori is an example of a [[two-dimensional]] [[manifold]]. According to the [[Surface (topology)|classification theorem]] for 2-manifolds, every [[compact space|compact]] [[connected space|connected]] 2-manifold is either a sphere, a connected sum of tori, or a connected sum of [[real projective plane]]s.

[[Double torus knot]]s are studied in [[knot theory]].

==Example==
The [[Bolza surface]] is the most symmetric [[Riemann surface]] of [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]]&amp;nbsp;2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12016">'''Ground-granulated blast-furnace slag''' ('''GGBS''' or '''GGBFS''') is obtained by quenching molten iron [[slag]] (a by-product of iron and steel-making) from a [[blast furnace]] in water or steam, to produce a [[glassy]], granular product that is then dried and ground into a fine powder.

==Production and composition==
The chemical composition of a slag varies considerably depending on the composition of the raw materials in the [[iron production]] process. Silicate and aluminate impurities from the [[ore]] and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] are combined in the [[blast furnace]] with a [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] which lowers the [[viscosity]] of the slag. In the case of pig [[iron production]] the flux consists mostly of a mixture of [[limestone]] and [[forsterite]] or in some cases [[dolomite]]. In the [[blast furnace]] the slag floats on top of the [[iron]] and is decanted for separation. Slow cooling of slag melts results in an unreactive crystalline material consisting of an assemblage of Ca-Al-Mg silicates. To obtain a good slag reactivity or hydraulicity, the slag melt needs to be rapidly cooled or quenched below 800&amp;nbsp;°C in order to prevent the crystallization of [[merwinite]] and [[melilite]]. To cool and fragment the slag a granulation process can be applied in which molten slag is subjected to jet streams of water or air under pressure. Alternatively, in the pelletization process the liquid slag is partially cooled with water and subsequently projected into the air by a rotating drum. In order to obtain a suitable reactivity, the obtained fragments are ground to reach the same fineness as [[Portland cement]].

The main components of blast furnace slag are CaO (30-50%), SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (28-38%), Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (8-24%), and MgO (1-18%). In general increasing the CaO content of the slag results in raised slag [[basicity]] and an increase in [[compressive strength]]. The MgO and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; content show the same trend up to respectively 10-12% and 14%, beyond which no further improvement can be obtained. Several compositional ratios or so-called hydraulic indices have been used to correlate slag composition with [[mineral hydration|hydraulic activity]]; the latter being mostly expressed as the binder [[compressive strength]].

The glass content of slags suitable for blending with [[Portland cement]] typically varies between 90-100% and depends on the cooling method and the temperature at which cooling is initiated. The [[glass]] structure of the quenched glass largely depends on the proportions of network-forming elements such as Si and Al over network-modifiers such as Ca, Mg and to a lesser extent Al. Increased amounts of network-modifiers lead to higher degrees of network depolymerization and reactivity.

Common crystalline constituents of blast-furnace slags are [[merwinite]] and [[melilite]]. Other minor components which can form during progressive crystallization are [[belite]], [[monticellite]], [[rankinite]], [[wollastonite]] and [[forsterite]]. Minor amounts of reduced sulphur are commonly encountered as [[oldhamite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snellings|first=R.|author2=Mertens G. |author3=Elsen J. |title=Supplementary cementitious materials|journal=Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry|date=2012|volume=74|pages=211–278|doi=10.2138/rmg.2012.74.6|bibcode=2012RvMG...74..211S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
GGBS is used to make durable concrete structures in combination with ordinary [[portland cement]] and/or other [[pozzolan]]ic materials. GGBS has been widely used in Europe, and increasingly in the United States and in Asia (particularly in Japan and [[Singapore]]) for its superiority in concrete durability, extending the lifespan of buildings from fifty years to a hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Department of Civil Engineering, BITS, Pilani – Hyderabad Campus|title=HIGH PERFORMANCE CONCRETE WITH GGBS AND ROBO SAND|url=http://www.ijest.info/docs/IJEST10-02-10-107.pdf|accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major uses of GGBS are in the production of quality-improved slag cement, namely Portland Blastfurnace cement (PBFC) and high-slag blast-furnace cement (HSBFC), with GGBS content ranging typically from 30 to 70%; and in the production of [[Ready-mix concrete|ready-mixed]] or site-batched durable concrete.

Concrete made with GGBS cement sets more slowly than concrete made with ordinary Portland cement, depending on the amount of GGBS in the cementitious material, but also continues to gain strength over a longer period in production conditions. This results in lower heat of [[Mineral hydration|hydration]] and lower temperature rises, and makes avoiding [[cold joint]]s easier, but may also affect construction schedules where quick setting is required.

Use of GGBS significantly reduces the risk of damages caused by [[alkali–silica reaction]] (ASR), provides higher resistance to [[chloride]] ingress — reducing the risk of reinforcement corrosion — and provides higher resistance to attacks by [[sulfate]] and other chemicals.

==How GGBS cement is used==
GGBS cement can be added to concrete in the concrete manufacturer's batching plant, along with Portland cement, aggregates and water. The normal ratios of aggregates and water to cementitious material in the mix remain unchanged. GGBS is used as a direct replacement for Portland cement, on a one-to-one basis by weight. Replacement levels for GGBS vary from 30% to up to 85%. Typically 40 to 50% is used in most instances.

The use of GGBS in addition to Portland cement in concrete in Europe is covered in the concrete standard EN 206:2013. This standard establishes two categories of additions to concrete along with ordinary Portland cement: nearly inert additions (Type I) and pozzolanic or latent hydraulic additions (Type II). GGBS cement falls in the latter category. As GGBS cement is slightly less expensive than Portland cement, concrete made with GGBS cement will be similarly priced to that made with ordinary Portland cement.

It is used partially as per mix ratio.

==Architectural and engineering benefits==

===Durability===
GGBS cement is routinely specified in concrete to provide protection against both sulphate attack and chloride attack. GGBS has now effectively replaced sulfate-resisting Portland cement (SRPC) on the market for sulfate resistance because of its superior performance and greatly reduced cost compared to SRPC. Most projects in [[Dublin Docklands|Dublin's Docklands]], including [[Spencer Dock]], are using GGBS in subsurface concrete for sulfate resistance.

To protect against chloride attack, GGBS is used at a replacement level of 50% in concrete. Instances of chloride attack occur in reinforced concrete in marine environments and in road bridges where the concrete is exposed to splashing from road de-icing salts. In most [[National Roads Authority|NRA]] projects in Ireland GGBS is now specified in structural concrete for bridge piers and [[abutment]]s for protection against chloride attack. The use of GGBS in such instances will increase the life of the structure by up to 50% had only Portland cement been used, and precludes the need for more expensive [[stainless steel]] reinforcing.

GGBS is also routinely used to limit the temperature rise in large concrete pours. The more gradual hydration of GGBS cement generates both lower peak and less total overall heat than Portland cement. This reduces thermal gradients in the concrete, which prevents the occurrence of [[microcracking]] which can weaken the concrete and reduce its durability, and was used for this purpose in the construction of the [[Jack Lynch Tunnel]] in [[Cork (city)|Cork]].

===Appearance===
In contrast to the stony grey of concrete made with Portland cement, the near-white color of GGBS cement permits architects to achieve a lighter colour for exposed fair-faced concrete finishes, at no extra cost. To achieve a lighter colour finish, GGBS is usually specified at between 50% to 70% replacement levels, although levels as high as 85% can be used. GGBS cement also produces a smoother, more defect free surface, due to the fineness of the GGBS particles. Dirt does not adhere to GGBS concrete as easily as concrete made with Portland cement, reducing maintenance costs. GGBS cement prevents the occurrence of [[efflorescence]], the staining of concrete surfaces by [[calcium carbonate]] deposits. Due to its much lower [[lime (mineral)|lime]]&lt;!-- or [[Calcium oxide]]?? --&gt; content and lower permeability, GGBS is effective in preventing efflorescence when used at replacement levels of 50% to 60%.

===Strength===
Concrete containing GGBS cement has a higher ultimate strength than concrete made with Portland cement. It has a higher proportion of the strength-enhancing [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (CSH) than concrete made with Portland cement only, and a reduced content of free lime, which does not contribute to concrete strength. Concrete made with GGBS continues to gain strength over time, and has been shown to double its 28-day strength over periods of 10 to 12 years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Sustainability===
Since GGBS is a by-product of steel manufacturing process, its use in concrete is recognized by [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] etc. as improving the sustainability of the project and will therefore add points towards LEED certification. In this respect, GGBS can also be used for superstructure in addition to the cases where the concrete is in contact with chlorides and sulfates. This is provided that the slower setting time for casting of the superstructure is justified.

The '''Heat-Ray''' is the primary offensive weapon used by the [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martians]] in [[H. G. Wells]]' classic [[science fiction]] novel ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' and its offshoots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Flynn | first = John L.  | title = War of the worlds: from Wells to Spielberg | publisher = Galactic Books | year = 2005 | pages = 23–26 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=T0aCSs1-23sC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=Heat-Ray+war+of+the+worlds&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=heat%20ray&amp;f=false | isbn = 978-0-9769400-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the novel ==
[[File:Alvim-correa12.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A Martian tripod fires its heat-ray, as imagined in a 1906 illustration.]]
The Heat-Ray is essentially a [[directed-energy weapon]], albeit that the name of "Heat-Ray" is more commonly applied to the destructive energy it projects than to the weapon itself; the latter described as a box-like or camera-like case mounted on larger machines, including [[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)|Tripod fighting-machines]], whereas the Ray was credited with striking targets at distances of at least two miles.

The novel explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"in some way they are able to generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute non-conductivity. This intense heat they project in a parallel beam against any object they choose, by means of a polished [[parabolic reflector|parabolic mirror]] of unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror of a [[lighthouse]] projects a beam of light... it is certain that a beam of heat is the essence of the matter. Heat, and invisible, instead of visible, light. Whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its touch, lead runs like water, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass, and when it falls upon water, incontinently that explodes into steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/warworlds/b1c6.html|title=War of the Worlds|author=H.G. Wells|chapter=6}}, ("The Heat-Ray in the Chobham Road")&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The only visible element of the ray was a flash emitted from the chamber, in which respect Wells' description is consistent with experimental directed-energy weapons of later years (such as a powerful [[CO2 laser|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Laser]]){{citation needed|date=December 2014}}.

== In other adaptations ==
The Heat-Ray is a feature of virtually every adaptation of the story. Many adaptations adhere to the characteristics given in the novel, such as the [[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|1938 CBS radio adaptation]]; even reciting near-verbatim descriptions.

The Heat-Ray is described in ''[[Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds]]'' and depicted on the album artwork painted by [[Mike Trim|Michael Trim]] as well as the art "Panic in the Streets" by [[Geoff Taylor (illustrator)|Geoff Taylor]], wherein it emanates from a [[proboscis]] in the cupola of the tripod.&lt;ref name="novelWikisourceBoxOrCase"&gt;[[Wikisource:The War of the Worlds/Book 1/Chapter 12]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Classics Illustrated]] comic book adaptation of ''The War of the Worlds'' portrays the Heat-Ray as a visible light yellowish/gold ray.

In the early science fiction novel ''[[Edison's Conquest of Mars]]'', as an answer to the Martian Heat-Ray, [[Thomas Edison]] designs a [[disintegrator ray]] for use by human invasion forces. This is the first appearance of such a device in science fiction.

In ''[[Sherlock Holmes's War of the Worlds]]'', the Heat-Ray is described as based on [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], and projected from a pink-hued, multifaceted [[Focus (optics)|focusing]] crystal.

In the spoof film ''[[Scary Movie 4]]'', the Heat-Ray's effects are given a comical treatment; the intersection scene shows a lady push another into the path of the Heat-Ray to get her clothes. In one scene, the [[President of the United States]], played by [[Leslie Nielsen]], announces to the [[United Nations]] that America has managed to capture a Heat-Ray. Its effects have been reversed, comically destroying the clothes of everyone in the room, with the President barely aware.

In [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]]'s sequel, ''[[The Massacre of Mankind]]'', the Heat-Ray is said to be an [[infrared laser]] with a beam temperature of 1500 degrees. The parabolic mirror is merely an aiming scope. A memorial to Heat-Ray victims, the "[[The Unknown Warrior|Tomb of the Vanished Warrior]]", is established in 1908, a year after the invasion; at the event, Prime Minister [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] was assassinated by members of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]]. 

=== 1953 film ===
{{main|The War of the Worlds (1953 film)}}
For the [[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|1953 film version]], the Martians [[manta ray]]-shaped war machines use a combination of three rays: one Heat-Ray on long necks atop of their machines, which fire red sparks, and two disintegrator rays on their wing tips, which are shown as green bolts. These two can only be pointed in the direction their ships face, while the Heat-Ray on top can be pointed in any direction. Most of their targets glow and vanish, sometimes leaving a stain or pile of ash; the Heat-Ray differs from the disintegrators as the former sets the surrounding environment ablaze as well as vaporizing the target within a few seconds. Although the Heat-Ray does have a simple destructive effect on certain objects, at other times, the ray would set objects ablaze or cause them to explode (as shown when the machines reach [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]). In one scene, General Mann states that it is likely the Martians generate radiation without using heavy screening to power their rays. The book's poisonous "Black Smoke" chemical weapon is replaced by the "''skeleton beam''". [[Doctor Clayton Forrester (War of the Worlds)|Doctor Clayton Forrester]] explained how these skeleton beams worked as such:

{{quote|''It neutralizes [[meson]]s somehow. They're the atomic glue holding matter together. Cut across their lines of magnetic force and any object will simply cease to exist.''}}

=== TV series ===
{{main|War of the Worlds (TV series)}}
As a sequel to the 1953 film, the Heat-Ray's use in the ''[[War of the Worlds (TV series)|War of the Worlds]]'' TV series is rather notable. Aside from their employment in the first episode (its destruction replayed in the opening credit sequence in subsequent episodes of the season), the main Heat-Ray is put to more attention in an episode in which the aliens are unable to unearth a buried warship from a recon mission and are forced to remove the gooseneck device from the ship and strap it atop a [[hearse]]. The aliens' mission in this episode is put to end when the Heat-Ray hits them after being reflected off a makeshift parabolic mirror.

The series also offered a Heat-Ray not employed by a war machine, but as a [[personal weapon]]. "The Second Seal" episode deals with the discovery of archives that contain remnants of the 1953 invasion. Among the material found is a boomerang-shaped weapon that fires Heat-Rays. These rays are the kind of green blobs fired from the tips of their warships, and are similarly shot from the ends of the object. 

The Heat-Rays featured in the series mirror the same power of the film. This includes the variation between their ability to visibly destroy something as well as simply making a target disappear. Although the word "Heat-Ray" is never applied in the series as it is in the 1953 or updated 2005 film, the term used in one episode is "Death-Ray".

=== 2005 film ===
{{main|War of the Worlds (2005 film)}}
In [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' adaptation of Wells' novel, the Heat-Ray is portrayed as two bluish-white rays having a [[Desiccation|desiccating]] effect on living objects, such as animals, and a 'disruptive' effect on other objects; but a [[Bayonne Bridge|bridge]] in one scene is thrown from its pylons when hit by the ray, as if physically struck, and in an earlier scene, brick-and-wood buildings are either destroyed or catch fire. Later in the movie, an army of tripods destroying a city is shown, with Heat-Rays collapsing targeted buildings in a similar fashion to the destruction of the bridge. Curiously, human clothing does not seem to be affected by the Heat-Rays, which is used to effect in one of the film's scenes when the clothes of slaughtered humans are floating along a river.

===The Asylum films===
{{main|H. G. Wells' War of the Worlds (David Michael Latt film)}}
In [[The Asylum]]'s 2005 film ''[[H. G. Wells' War of the Worlds (David Michael Latt film)|H.G Wells' War of the Worlds]]'' (also entitled ''Invasion''), the Heat-Ray is seen as a bluish-green light and is built inside the "walkers", which are not tripods, but six-legged machines resembling [[crab]]s. The ray fires from the walker's single "eye". When the ray hits humans, they are instantly burned to the bone. The ray can also be used to destroy buildings. A character named Pvt. Kerry Williams compares the ray's effect on a human to a [[fly zapper]]'s effect on a fly.
{{main|War of the Worlds 2: The Next Wave}}
In the film's sequel, ''[[War of the Worlds 2: The Next Wave]]'', a kind of Heat-ray can be seen firing from the 'squid-walkers', a living race of flying cybernetic [[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)|tripods]]; but the effects of this weapon are largely unknown, as the ray itself is used infrequently. It is most notably used to devastate [[London]] and [[Paris]]. Another kind of ray is also attached to the machines, but it is made to transport living humans into the mothership.

=== Pendragon Pictures film ===
{{main|H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds (Timothy Hines film)}}
In the lesser-known 2005 low-budget, [[direct-to-video]] film adaptation from Pendragon Pictures, ''[[H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds (Timothy Hines film)|H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds]]'', the generator is held by a small arm that extends from the hood of the machine (not one of the many visible tentacles/arms they use to capture humans). Three metallic fingers hold a rapidly spinning disc, generating the Heat-Ray; and when it touches flesh, the victim is reduced to bones.

=== ''War of the Worlds: Goliath'' ===
{{main|War of the Worlds: Goliath}}
There are Heat-Rays used by both humans and martians in this 2012 animated film, wherein human Heat-Rays are a reddish-orange color and the Martian Heat-Rays light green.

The '''Hoya de Los Vicentes Solar Plant''' ({{lang-es|'''Parque Solar Hoya de Los Vicentes'''}}) is a [[photovoltaic power station]] in [[Jumilla]], [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] in [[Spain]]. The solar park covers area of some {{convert|100|ha}} and comprises a group of 200&amp;nbsp;[[photovoltaic array]]s with a total capacity of 23&amp;nbsp;MW.  A total of 120,000&amp;nbsp;[[solar panel]]s have been installed in the facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exenewable.com/projectProfile.asp?id=12615 eXenewable Project Profile Page - Hoya de Los Vicentes, PV, Spain]&lt;/ref&gt; The project generates energy equivalent to the annual consumption of 20,000&amp;nbsp;households.

'''Imidazolate''' (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N{{su|b=2|p=−}}) is the conjugate base of [[imidazole]].  It is a nucleophile and a strong base.  The free anion has C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; [[symmetry group|symmetry]].  Imidazole has a [[pKa|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of 14.05,&lt;ref name=Walba /&gt; so the deprotonation of imidazole (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H) requires a strong base.

==Occurrence==
Imidazolate is a common [[bridging ligand]] in [[coordination chemistry]]. In the [[zeolitic imidazolate framework]]s, the metals are interconnected via imidazolates.&lt;ref&gt;Phan, A.; Doonan, C.

'''Inert waste''' is waste which is neither chemically nor biologically reactive and will not decompose. Examples of this are sand and [[concrete]]. This has particular relevance to [[landfill]]s as inert waste typically requires lower disposal fees than [[biodegradable waste]] or [[hazardous waste]].
This type of waste coagulates in the environment and can cause serious problem, much like filling up of areas, but they are also relatively less harmful than plastics as they don't give out harmful residues after hundreds of years.

In the field of [[heat transfer]], '''intensity of radiation''' &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of the distribution of radiant heat flux per unit area and [[solid angle]], in a particular direction, defined according to

:&lt;math&gt;dq = I\, d\omega\, \cos \theta\, dA&lt;/math&gt;

where

*&lt;math&gt;dA&lt;/math&gt; is the infinitesimal source area 
*&lt;math&gt;dq&lt;/math&gt; is the ''outgoing'' heat transfer from the area &lt;math&gt;dA&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;d\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[solid angle]] subtended by the infinitesimal 'target' (or 'aperture') area &lt;math&gt;dA_a&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the source area normal vector and the line-of-sight between the source and the target areas.

Typical units of intensity are W·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·sr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Intensity can sometimes be called [[radiance]], especially in other fields of study.

The emissive power of a surface can be determined by integrating the intensity of emitted radiation over a hemisphere surrounding the surface:

:&lt;math&gt;q = \int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} \int_{\theta=0}^{\pi/2} I \cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta d\phi&lt;/math&gt;

For diffuse emitters, the emitted radiation intensity is the same in all directions, with the result that

:&lt;math&gt;E = \pi I&lt;/math&gt;

The factor &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; (which really should have the units of [[steradian]]s) is a result of the fact that intensity is defined to exclude the effect of reduced [[view factor]] at large values &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;; note that the solid angle corresponding to a hemisphere is equal to &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; steradians.

'''[[Specific radiative intensity|Spectral intensity]]''' &lt;math&gt;I_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding spectral measurement of intensity; in other words, the intensity as a function of [[wavelength]].

'''Joseph Henry Keenan''' (August 24, 1900 – July 17, 1977) was an American [[thermodynamicist]] and [[mechanical engineer]] noted for his work in the calculation of steam tables, research in jet-rocket propulsion, and his work in furthering the development in the understanding of the [[laws of thermodynamics]] in the mid 20th century.  His classic 1941 textbook ''Thermodynamics'' served as a fundamental teaching tool in various [[engineering]] curricula during the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Keenan | first = Joseph, H. | title = Thermodynamics | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. | year = 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shapiro, Ascher|authorlink=Ascher H. Shapiro|title=Joseph H. Keenan|journal=Physics Today|date=November 1977|volume=30|issue=11|pages=74–76|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v30/i11/p74_s2?bypassSSO=1|doi=10.1063/1.3037802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He earned a bachelor's degree in naval architecture and marine engineering at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1922. After working as a design engineer on steam turbines for [[General Electric Company]], Keenan became an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in 1928. In 1934, he became an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He was promoted to professor in 1939. He served as Head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering from  1958 to 1961.

A major portion of Keenan’s career was devoted to the development of accurate tables of the properties of steam, which are vital to the electric power industry.  In 1929, he was appointed the U.S. delegate to the First International Conference on the Properties of Steam; he served as delegate in all successive conferences on this subject through the eighth in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/keenansymposium/aboutjhkeenan/biography/index.html Joseph Henry Keenan] (1900-1977) - Biography&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, he published the classic textbook ''Principles of General Thermodynamics'' with [[George Hatsopoulos]] which was major turning point in thermodynamics since [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Merle Randall]] with their 1923 ''Thermodynamics'' textbook.  Their now famous version of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] is:

&lt;div style="font-size:115%"&gt;
{{cquote|When an isolated system performs a process after the removal of a series of internal constraints, it will reach a unique state of equilibrium: this state of equilibrium is independent of the order in which the constraints are removed.}}&lt;/div&gt;

This shows that the second law of thermodynamics can be stated in terms of the existence of stable equilibrium states.

He was a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]]. He was award the [[ASME]] Worcester Reed Warner Medal in 1955 for work on thermodynamics and the properties of steam. He was elected to the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in 1976.

In 2007, an International Thermodynamics Symposium called “meeting the [[entropy]] challenge” was organized in [[M.I.T.]] in Honor and Memory of Professor Joseph Henry Keenan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/keenansymposium/index.html Meeting the Entropy Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is based on quantum mechanics (first-order perturbation theory) and the [[random phase approximation]]. 

[[Thomas–Fermi screening]] can be derived as a special case of the more general Lindhard formula. In particular, Thomas–Fermi screening is the limit of the Lindhard formula when the wavevector (the reciprocal of the length-scale of interest) is much smaller than the Fermi wavevector, i.e. the long-distance limit.&lt;ref name=Ashcroft/&gt;

This article uses [[Gaussian units|cgs-Gaussian units]].

== Formula ==
The Lindhard formula for the longitudinal [[dielectric function]] is given by
::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
| &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(q,\omega) = 1 - V_q \sum_k{\frac{f_{k-q}-f_k}{\hbar(\omega+i\delta)+E_{k-q}-E_k}}.&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Here, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is a positive infinitesimal constant, &lt;math&gt;V_q&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;V_\text{eff}(q) - V_\text{ind}(q)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt; is the carrier distribution function which is the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Fermi–Dirac distribution function]] for electrons in thermodynamic equilibrium.
However this Lindhard formula is valid also for nonequilibrium distribution functions.

== Analysis of the Lindhard formula ==
To understand the Lindhard formula, let's consider some limiting cases in 2 and 3 dimensions. The 1-dimensional case is also considered in other ways.

=== Three dimensions ===

==== Long wavelength limit ====
First, let's consider the long wavelength limit (&lt;math&gt;q\to0&lt;/math&gt;).

For the denominator of the Lindhard formula, we get

: &lt;math&gt;E_{k-q} - E_k = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(k^2-2\vec{k}\cdot\vec{q}+q^2) - \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} \simeq -\frac{\hbar^2 \vec{k}\cdot\vec{q}}{m}&lt;/math&gt;,

and for the numerator of the Lindhard formula, we get

: &lt;math&gt;f_{k-q} - f_k = f_k - \vec{q}\cdot\nabla_k f_k + \cdots - f_k \simeq - \vec{q}\cdot\nabla_k f_k&lt;/math&gt;.

Inserting these into the Lindhard formula and taking the &lt;math&gt;\delta \to 0&lt;/math&gt; limit, we obtain

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{alignat}{2}
\epsilon(0,\omega_0) &amp; \simeq 1 + V_q \sum_{k,i}{ \frac{q_i \frac{\partial f_k}{\partial k_i}}{\hbar \omega_0 - \frac{\hbar^2 \vec{k}\cdot\vec{q}}{m}} }\\
&amp; \simeq 1 + \frac{V_q}{\hbar \omega_0} \sum_{k,i}{q_i \frac{\partial f_k}{\partial k_i}}(1+\frac{\hbar \vec{k}\cdot\vec{q}}{m \omega_0})\\
&amp; \simeq 1 + \frac{V_q}{\hbar \omega_0} \sum_{k,i}{q_i \frac{\partial f_k}{\partial k_i}}\frac{\hbar \vec{k}\cdot\vec{q}}{m \omega_0}\\
&amp; = 1 - V_q \frac{q^2}{m \omega_0^2} \sum_k{f_k}\\
&amp; = 1 - V_q \frac{q^2 N}{m \omega_0^2} \\
&amp; = 1 - \frac{4 \pi e^2}{\epsilon q^2 L^3} \frac{q^2 N}{m \omega_0^2} \\
&amp; = 1 - \frac{\omega_{pl}^2}{\omega_0^2}
\end{alignat}
&lt;/math&gt;,
where we used &lt;math&gt;E_k = \hbar \omega_k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V_q = \frac{4 \pi e^2}{\epsilon q^2 L^3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_{pl}^2 = \frac{4 \pi e^2 N}{\epsilon L^3 m}&lt;/math&gt;.

(In SI units, replace the factor &lt;math&gt;4\pi &lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;1/\epsilon_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.)

This result is the same as the classical dielectric function.

==== Static Limit ====
Second, consider the static limit (&lt;math&gt;\omega + i\delta \to 0&lt;/math&gt;).
The Lindhard formula becomes
: &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(q,0) = 1 - V_q \sum_k{\frac{f_{k-q}-f_k}{E_{k-q}-E_k}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Inserting the above equalities for the denominator and numerator, we obtain

: &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(q,0) = 1 - V_q \sum_{k,i}{\frac{-q_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial k_i} }{ -\frac{\hbar^2 \vec{k}\cdot\vec{q}}{m} }}
 = 1 - V_q \sum_{k,i}{\frac{q_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial k_i} }{\frac{\hbar^2 \vec{k}\cdot\vec{q}}{m} }}&lt;/math&gt;.
Assuming a thermal equilibrium Fermi–Dirac carrier distribution, we get
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i}{ q_i \frac{\partial f_k}{\partial k_i} } = -\sum_{i}{ q_i \frac{\partial f_k}{\partial \mu} \frac{\partial \epsilon_k}{\partial k_i} } = -\sum_{i}{ q_i k_i \frac{\hbar^2}{m} \frac{\partial f_k}{\partial \mu}}
&lt;/math&gt;
here, we used &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_k = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \epsilon_k}{\partial k_i} = \frac{\hbar^2 k_i}{m} &lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, 
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{alignat}{2}
\epsilon(q,0) &amp; = 
1 + V_q \sum_{k,i}{\frac{ q_i k_i \frac{\hbar^2}{m} \frac{\partial f_k}{\partial \mu} }{\frac{\hbar^2 \vec{k}\cdot\vec{q}}{m} }} = 
1 + V_q\sum_k{\frac{\partial f_k}{\partial \mu}} = 
1 + \frac{4 \pi e^2}{\epsilon q^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} \frac{1}{L^3} \sum_k{f_k} \\
&amp; = 1 + \frac{4 \pi e^2}{\epsilon q^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} \frac{N}{L^3} =
1 + \frac{4 \pi e^2}{\epsilon q^2} \frac{\partial n}{\partial \mu} \equiv
1 + \frac{\kappa^2}{q^2}.
\end{alignat}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the 3D screening wave number (3D inverse screening length) defined as 
&lt;math&gt;\kappa = \sqrt{ \frac{4\pi e^2}{\epsilon} \frac{\partial n}{\partial \mu} }&lt;/math&gt;.

Then, the 3D statically screened Coulomb potential is given by
: &lt;math&gt;V_s(q,\omega=0) \equiv \frac{V_q}{\epsilon(q,\omega=0)} = \frac {\frac{4 \pi e^2}{\epsilon q^2 L^3} }{ \frac{q^2 + \kappa^2}{q^2} }  = \frac{4 \pi e^2}{\epsilon L^3} \frac{1}{q^2 + \kappa^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

And the Fourier transformation of this result gives
: &lt;math&gt;V_s(r) = \sum_q{ \frac{4\pi e^2}{\epsilon L^3 (q^2+\kappa^2)} e^{i \vec{q} \cdot \vec{r}} } = \frac{e^2}{\epsilon r} e^{-\kappa r}&lt;/math&gt;
known as the [[Yukawa potential]]. Note that in this Fourier transformation, which is basically a sum over ''all'' &lt;math&gt;\vec{q}&lt;/math&gt;, we used the expression for small &lt;math&gt;|\vec{q}|&lt;/math&gt; for ''every'' value of &lt;math&gt;\vec{q}&lt;/math&gt; which is not correct.

[[File:Screening.png|500px|thumb|Statically screened potential(upper curved surface) and Coulomb potential(lower curved surface) in three dimensions]]

For a degenerated [[Fermi gas]] (''T''=0), [[Fermi energy]] is given by
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm F} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(3\pi^2 n)^{\frac{2}{3}} &lt;/math&gt;,
So the density is 
:&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{1}{3\pi^2}  \left(\frac{2m}{\hbar^2} E_{\rm F}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}} &lt;/math&gt;.

At T=0, &lt;math&gt;E_{\rm F} \equiv \mu&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial n}{\partial \mu} = \frac{3}{2}\frac{n}{E_{\rm F}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Inserting this into the above 3D screening wave number equation, we obtain

::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
|&lt;math&gt;\kappa = \sqrt{ \frac{4\pi e^2}{\epsilon} \frac{\partial n}{\partial \mu} } = \sqrt{ \frac{6\pi e^2 n}{\epsilon E_{\rm F}} }&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

This is the 3D [[Thomas–Fermi screening]] wave number.

For reference, [[Debye length|Debye-Hückel screening]] describes the nondegenerate limit case.

The result is &lt;math&gt;\kappa = \sqrt{ \frac{4\pi e^2 n \beta}{\epsilon} }&lt;/math&gt;, 3D Debye-Hückel screening wave number.

=== Two dimensions ===

==== Long wavelength limit ====
First, consider the long wavelength limit (&lt;math&gt;q\to0&lt;/math&gt;).

For the denominator of the Lindhard formula,

: &lt;math&gt;E_{k-q} - E_k = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(k^2-2\vec{k}\cdot\vec{q}+q^2) - \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} \simeq -\frac{\hbar^2 \vec{k}\cdot\vec{q}}{m}&lt;/math&gt;,

and for the numerator,

: &lt;math&gt;f_{k-q} - f_k = f_k - \vec{q}\cdot\nabla_k f_k + \cdots - f_k \simeq - \vec{q}\cdot\nabla_k f_k&lt;/math&gt;.

Inserting these into the Lindhard formula and taking the limit of &lt;math&gt;\delta \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{alignat}{2}
\epsilon(0,\omega) &amp; \simeq 1 + V_q \sum_{k,i}{ \frac{q_i \frac{\partial f_k}{\partial k_i}}{\hbar \omega_0 - \frac{\hbar^2 \vec{k}\cdot\vec{q}}{m}} }\\
&amp; \simeq 1 + \frac{V_q}{\hbar \omega_0} \sum_{k,i}{q_i \frac{\partial f_k}{\partial k_i}}(1+\frac{\hbar \vec{k}\cdot\vec{q}}{m \omega_0})\\
&amp; \simeq 1 + \frac{V_q}{\hbar \omega_0} \sum_{k,i}{q_i \frac{\partial f_k}{\partial k_i}}\frac{\hbar \vec{k}\cdot\vec{q}}{m \omega_0}\\
&amp; = 1 + \frac{V_q}{\hbar \omega_0} 2 \int d^2 k (\frac{L}{2 \pi})^2 \sum_{i,j}{q_i \frac{\partial f_k}{\partial k_i}}\frac{\hbar k_j q_j}{m \omega_0}\\
&amp; = 1 + \frac{V_q L^2}{m \omega_0^2} 2 \int \frac{d^2 k}{(2 \pi)^2}  \sum_{i,j}{q_i q_j k_j \frac{\partial f_k}{\partial k_i}}\\
&amp; = 1 + \frac{V_q L^2}{m \omega_0^2} \sum_{i,j}{ q_i q_j 2 \int \frac{d^2 k}{(2 \pi)^2} k_j \frac{\partial f_k}{\partial k_i}}\\
&amp; = 1 - \frac{V_q L^2}{m \omega_0^2} \sum_{i,j}{ q_i q_j 2 \int \frac{d^2 k}{(2 \pi)^2} k_k \frac{\partial f_j}{\partial k_i}}\\
&amp; = 1 - \frac{V_q L^2}{m \omega_0^2} \sum_{i,j}{ q_i q_j n \delta_{ij}}\\
&amp; = 1 - \frac{2 \pi e^2}{\epsilon q L^2} \frac{L^2}{m \omega_0^2} q^2 n\\
&amp; = 1 - \frac{\omega_{pl}^2(q)}{\omega_0^2},
\end{alignat}
&lt;/math&gt;
where we used &lt;math&gt;E_k = \hbar \epsilon_k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V_q = \frac{2 \pi e^2}{\epsilon q L^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_{pl}^2(q) = \frac{2 \pi e^2 n q}{\epsilon m}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Static Limit ====
Second, consider the static limit (&lt;math&gt;\omega + i\delta \to 0&lt;/math&gt;).
The Lindhard formula becomes
: &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(q,0) = 1 - V_q \sum_k{\frac{f_{k-q}-f_k}{E_{k-q}-E_k}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Inserting the above equalities for the denominator and numerator, we obtain

: &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(q,0) = 1 - V_q \sum_{k,i}{\frac{-q_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial k_i} }{ -\frac{\hbar^2 \vec{k}\cdot\vec{q}}{m} }}
 = 1 - V_q \sum_{k,i}{\frac{q_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial k_i} }{\frac{\hbar^2 \vec{k}\cdot\vec{q}}{m} }}&lt;/math&gt;.
Assuming a thermal equilibrium Fermi–Dirac carrier distribution, we get
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i}{ q_i \frac{\partial f_k}{\partial k_i} } = -\sum_{i}{ q_i \frac{\partial f_k}{\partial \mu} \frac{\partial \epsilon_k}{\partial k_i} } = -\sum_{i}{ q_i k_i \frac{\hbar^2}{m} \frac{\partial f_k}{\partial \mu}}
&lt;/math&gt;
here, we used &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_k = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \epsilon_k}{\partial k_i} = \frac{\hbar^2 k_i}{m} &lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, 
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{alignat}{2}
\epsilon(q,0) &amp; = 
1 + V_q \sum_{k,i}{\frac{ q_i k_i \frac{\hbar^2}{m} \frac{\partial f_k}{\partial \mu} }{\frac{\hbar^2 \vec{k}\cdot\vec{q}}{m} }} = 
1 + V_q\sum_k{\frac{\partial f_k}{\partial \mu}} = 
1 + \frac{2 \pi e^2}{\epsilon q L^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} \sum_k{f_k} \\
&amp; = 1 + \frac{2 \pi e^2}{\epsilon q} \frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} \frac{N}{L^2} =
1 + \frac{2 \pi e^2}{\epsilon q} \frac{\partial n}{\partial \mu} \equiv
1 + \frac{\kappa}{q}.
\end{alignat}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is 2D screening wave number(2D inverse screening length) defined as 
&lt;math&gt;\kappa = \frac{2\pi e^2}{\epsilon} \frac{\partial n}{\partial \mu}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then, the 2D statically screened Coulomb potential is given by
: &lt;math&gt;V_s(q,\omega=0) \equiv \frac{V_q}{\epsilon(q,\omega=0)} = \frac{2 \pi e^2}{\epsilon q L^2} \frac{q}{q + \kappa} = \frac{2 \pi e^2}{\epsilon L^2} \frac{1}{q + \kappa}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is known that the chemical potential of the [[Two-dimensional electron gas|2-dimensional Fermi gas]] is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\mu (n,T) = \frac{1}{\beta} \ln{(e^{\hbar^2 \beta \pi n/m}-1)}&lt;/math&gt;,

and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial n} = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi}{m} \frac{1}{1-e^{-\hbar^2 \beta \pi n / m}}&lt;/math&gt;.

So, the 2D screening wave number is 
::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
| &lt;math&gt;\kappa = \frac{2\pi e^2}{\epsilon}\frac{\partial n}{\partial \mu} = \frac{2\pi e^2}{\epsilon} \frac{m}{\hbar^2 \pi} (1-e^{-\hbar^2 \beta \pi n / m}) = \frac{2 m e^2}{ \hbar^2\epsilon} f_{k=0} .&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Note that this result is independent of ''n''.

=== One Dimension ===
This time, let's consider some generalized case for lowering the dimension.
The lower the dimension is, the weaker the screening effect.
In lower dimension, some of the field lines pass through the barrier material wherein the screening has no effect.
For the 1-dimensional case, we can guess that the screening affects only the field lines which are very close to the wire axis.

==== Experiment ====
In real experiment, we should also take the 3D bulk screening effect into account even though we deal with 1D case like the single filament. The Thomas–Fermi screening has been applied to an electron gas confined to a filament and a coaxial cylinder.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=D.|date=1973|title=Thomas-Fermi Screening in One Dimension|journal=Physical Review B|volume=7|issue=1|pages=129–135|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.7.129|bibcode=1973PhRvB...7..129D}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pt(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;0.32&lt;/sub&gt;·2.6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0 filament, it was found that the potential within the region between the filament and cylinder varies as &lt;math&gt;e^{-k_{\rm eff}r}/r&lt;/math&gt; and its effective screening length is about 10 times that of metallic [[platinum]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Electric bicycles==
{{main|Electric bicycle}}
Electric bicycles can be separated into different categories. The amount just of Pedelec models currently and past available in Europe is about 12000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ebike-base.com/search/advanced-search/ |title=Advanced search - E-Bike Base |date=2014-06-13 |accessdate=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* ''E-bikes with pedal-assist only'': either ''[[Pedelec|pedelecs]]'' (legally classed as bicycles) or ''S-Pedelecs'' (often legally classed as [[moped]]s)
** ''[[Pedelecs]]'': have pedal-assist only, motor assists only up to a decent but not excessive speed (usually 25&amp;nbsp;km/h), motor power up to 250 watts, often legally classed as bicycles 
** ''S-Pedelecs'': have pedal-assist only, motor power can be greater than 250 watts, can attain a higher speed (e.g., 45&amp;nbsp;km/h) before motor stops assisting, legally classed as a moped or motorcycle ('''not''' a bicycle)
* ''E-bikes with power-on-demand'' and ''pedal-assist''
* ''E-bikes with power-on-demand only'': often have more powerful motors than pedelecs but not always, the more powerful of these are legally classed as mopeds or motorcycles

In aviation, '''manufacturer's empty weight''' (MEW) (also known as manufacturer's weight empty (MWE)) is the weight of the aircraft "as built" and includes the weight of the structure, power plant, furnishings, installations, systems and other equipment that are considered an integral part of an aircraft before additional operator items are added for operation. 

''Basic aircraft empty weight'' is essentially the same and excludes any baggage, passengers, or [[usable fuel]].  Some manufacturers define this empty weight as including optional equipment, i.e. GPS units, cargo baskets, or spotlights.

==Specification MEW==

This is the MEW quoted in the manufacturer's standard specification documents and is the aircraft standard basic dry weight upon which all other standard specifications and aircraft performance are based by the manufacturer.

The '''Specification MEW includes''' the weight of:&lt;ref&gt;Torenbeek, Egbert. ''Synthesis of Subsonic Airplane Design''. Delft University Press. {{ISBN|90-247-2724-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Airframe]] structure – primary and secondary structures ([[fuselage]], [[wing]], tail, control surfaces, [[nacelle]]s, [[landing gear]]).
* [[Powerplant]].
* [[Auxiliary power unit]] (APU).
* Systems (instruments, navigation, hydraulics, pneumatics, fuel systems (''but not fuel itself''), electrical system, electronics, fixed furnishings (''but not operator specific''), air conditioning, anti-ice system, etc.).
* Fixed equipment and services considered an integral part of the aircraft.
* Fixed ballast (if present).
* Closed system fluids (such as [[hydraulic fluid]]s).

For small aircraft, the MEW may include unusable fuel and oil.

The '''Specification MEW excludes''' the weight of:

* All fuel (both usable and unusable).
* Potable water, anti-ice, and chemicals in toilets.
* Engine oil and APU oil.
* All specification items, selections, and installations which are non-basic (i.e. optional selections).
* Customer specific selections, installations, and options.
* Operator/operating items.
* Removable equipment and services.
* Payload.

For small aircraft, the specification MEW is known as the ''standard empty weight'' (or ''standard weight empty'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2550">'''Medical grade silicones''' are [[silicone]]s tested for [[biocompatibility]] and are appropriate to be used for medical applications. In  the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) regulates devices [[Implant (medicine)|implant]]ed into the body. It does not regulate materials other than certain dental materials.  The FDA regulate silicones used in food contact under the auspices of the Center for Food Safety and Nutrition  (CFSAN) and for use in pharmaceuticals under the auspices of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research  (CDER).

Medical grade silicones are generally grouped into three categories: non implantable, short term implantable, and long-term implantable. Materials approved as Class V and VI can be considered medical grade. Most medical grade silicones are at least Class VI certified. Silicone suppliers and some silicone prototyping companies provide guidelines for material use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albright1.com/manual - Silicone Molding Design Manual]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
*Tubing
*Drains
*Feeding tubes
*Catheters
*Implants for long and short term use
*Seals and gaskets
*Syringe pistons
*[[Silicone scar sheet|Scar Treatment Silicone Sheets]] (FDA Class 1 Medical Device) and gels.
*Condoms
*[[Menstrual cup]]s 
*Sex toys
*Non-Stick Containers
*Respiratory masks&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cva-silicone.com/en/silicone-life-sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Silicone rubber applications such as [[catheter]]s are widespread in medicine, but have several limitations. For example, they exhibit poor tear [[strength of materials|strength]] and poor resistance to [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]]. Brittle fracture can occur from defects within sections owing to poor control of [[vulcanization]]. It resulted in high failure rates for [[breast implant]]s, and much subsequent litigation in the USA, as well as elsewhere in the world. It led to a crisis of confidence in the US, with many manufacturers being forced out of the business entirely, and others to manufacture under FDA control.

'''Metal peroxides''' are metal-containing compounds with ionically- or covalently-bonded peroxide ({{chem|O|2|2−}}) groups. This large family of compounds can be divided into ionic and covalent peroxide. The first class mostly contains the peroxides of the [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[alkaline earth metal]]s whereas the covalent peroxides are represented by such compounds as hydrogen peroxide and [[peroxymonosulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;). In contrast to the purely ionic character of alkali metal peroxides, peroxides of [[transition metal]]s have a more covalent character.&lt;ref name=volnov/&gt;

==Bonding in {{chem|O|2|2−}}==
[[File:MO-Peroxid.png|thumb|300px|Molecular orbital diagram of the peroxide ion]]
The peroxide ion is composed of two oxygen atoms that are linked by a single bond. The [[molecular orbital diagram]] of the peroxide dianion predicts a doubly occupied antibonding π* orbital and a [[bond order]] of one. The bond length is 149 [[picometer|pm]], which is larger than in the ground state ([[triplet oxygen]]) of the oxygen molecule (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 121 pm). This translates into the smaller [[Hooke's law|force constant]] of the bond (2.8&amp;nbsp;[[Newton (unit)|N]]/cm vs. 11.4&amp;nbsp;N/cm for &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and the lower [[frequency]] of the molecular vibration (770&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; vs. 1555&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=howi504&gt;Wiberg, Egon; Wiberg, Nils and Holleman, Arnold Frederick [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mtth5g59dEIC&amp;pg=PA476 ''Inorganic Chemistry''], Academic Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}, pp. 475 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The peroxide ion can be compared with [[superoxide]] {{chem|O|2|−}}, which is a radical, and dioxygen, a diradical.&lt;ref name=howi504/&gt;

== Preparation of peroxide salts ==
Most alkali metal peroxides can be synthesized directly by oxygenation of the elements. [[Lithium peroxide]] is formed upon treating [[lithium hydroxide]] with hydrogen peroxide:&lt;ref name=volnov&gt;Vol'nov, I. I. ''Peroxides, superoxides and ozonides of alkali and alkaline earth metals'', pp. 21–51, Plenum Press, New York, 1966, no ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;

: 2 LiOH  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →   Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Barium peroxide is prepared by oxygenation of [[barium oxide]] at elevated temperature and pressure.&lt;ref name=howi531&gt;Wiberg, Egon; Wiberg, Nils and Holleman, Arnold Frederick [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mtth5g59dEIC&amp;pg=PA471 ''Inorganic Chemistry''], Academic Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}, pp. 471–502&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math chem&gt;\overbrace\ce{2BaO}^\ce{barium\ oxide} + \ce{O2}_\ce{(air)} \ce{-&gt;[500 ^\circ \ce C]} \overbrace\ce{2BaO2}^\ce{barium\ peroxide} \ce{-&gt;[700 ^\circ \ce C]}\ \ce{2BaO} + \ce{O2}&lt;/math&gt;
Barium peroxide was once used to produce pure oxygen from air. This process relies on the temperature-dependent chemical balance between barium oxide and peroxide: the reaction of barium oxide with air at 500&amp;nbsp;°C results in barium peroxide, which upon heating to above 700&amp;nbsp;°C in oxygen decomposes back to barium oxide releasing pure oxygen.&lt;ref name=howi531/&gt;.  The lighter alkaline earth metals [[calcium peroxide|calcium]] and [[magnesium peroxide|magnesium]] also form peroxides, whichcate used commercially as oxygen sources or oxidizers.

===Reaction of peroxide salts===
Few reactions are generally formulated for peroxide salt. In excess of dilute acids or water they release hydrogen peroxide.&lt;ref name=volnov/&gt;

:Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2&amp;nbsp;HCl →  2&amp;nbsp;NaCl  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Upon heating, the reaction with water leads to the release of oxygen.&lt;ref name=volnov/&gt; Upon exposure to air, alkali metal peroxides absorb CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to give peroxycarbonates.

==Transition metal peroxides==
Unlike the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal peroxides, binary transition metal peroxides, i.e., compounds containing only metal cations and peroxide anions, are rare.  Metal dioxides are pervasive, e.g. [[manganese dioxide|MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and rutile (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but these are oxides, not peroxides. Well characterized examples include the d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; metal cations, [[Zinc peroxide]] (ZnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), two polymorphs, both explosive, of [[mercury peroxide]] (HgO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and cadmium peroxide (CdO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

Peroxide is a common ligand in [[metal complex]]es.  Within the area of [[transition metal dioxygen complex]]es, {{chem|O|2|2−}} functions as a [[bidentate ligand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mimoun, H.|chapter=Transition-metal peroxides—synthesis and use as oxidizing agents|title=Peroxides|editor=S. Patai|year=1983|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|doi=10.1002/9780470771730.ch15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some complexes have only peroxide ligands, e.g.,  [[chromium(VI) oxide peroxide]] ({{chem|Cr(O|2|)|4|2−}}). Similarly, [[molybdate]] reacts in alkaline media with peroxide to form red peroxomolybdate {{chem|Mo(O|2|)|4|2−}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eagleson, Mary |title=Concise encyclopedia chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Owuv-c9L_IMC&amp;pg=PA660|year=1994|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-011451-5|pages=660–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction of hydrogen peroxide with aqueous titanium(IV) gives a brightly colored peroxy complex that is a useful test for [[titanium]] as well as hydrogen peroxide.  Many [[transition metal dioxygen complex]]es are best described as adducts of peroxide.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, N. N.; &amp; Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd Edn.), Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. {{ISBN|0-7506-3365-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Many inorganic peroxides are used for [[bleach]]ing [[textiles]] and [[paper]] and as a bleaching additive to detergents and cleaning products.&lt;ref name=howi531/&gt; The increasing environmental concerns resulted in the preference of peroxides over chlorine-based compounds and a sharp increase in the peroxide production.&lt;ref name=offer&gt;

Bruce King, John Wiley &amp; Sons {{ISBN|0-471-93620-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been largely replaced by [[Sodium percarbonate|percarbonates]]. The use of peroxide compounds in detergents is often reflected in their trade names; for example, [[Persil]] is a combination of the words ''per''borate and ''sil''icate.

Some peroxide salts release oxygen upon reaction with carbon dioxide. This reaction is used in generation of oxygen from exhaled carbon dioxide on [[submarine]]s and spaceships. Sodium or lithium peroxides are preferred in space applications because of their lower [[molar mass]] and therefore higher oxygen yield per unit weight.&lt;ref name=howi531/&gt;

Alkali metal peroxides can be used for the synthesis of organic peroxides. One example is the conversion of [[benzoyl chloride]] with sodium peroxide to di[[benzoyl peroxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gambarjan|first1=Stephan|title=Diphenylamine and Acylperoxyde|journal=Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft|volume=42|pages=4003|year=1909|doi=10.1002/cber.190904203164|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peroxodibenzoyl.png|center|450px|Synthesis of dibenzoyl]]

==History==
[[Alexander von Humboldt]] synthesized [[barium peroxide]] in 1799 as a byproduct of his attempts to decompose air.

Nineteen years later [[Louis Jacques Thénard]] recognized that this compound could be used for the preparation of hydrogen peroxide.&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Jones, J. H. Clark. ''Applications of Hydrogen Peroxide and Derivatives''. Royal Society of Chemistry, '''1999'''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thénard and [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] synthesized [[sodium peroxide]] in 1811. The bleaching effect of peroxides and their salts on [[natural dye]]s became known around that time, but early attempts of industrial production of peroxides failed, and the first plant producing hydrogen peroxide was built in 1873 in [[Berlin]].

'''Nanofluid-based direct solar collectors''' are [[solar thermal collector]]s where [[nanoparticle]]s in a liquid medium can scatter and [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorb]] [[solar radiation]].  They have recently received interest to efficiently distribute [[solar energy]]. [[Nanofluid]]-based solar collector have the potential to harness solar radiant energy more efficiently compared to conventional [[solar thermal collector|solar collectors]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/lsa/journal/v1/n10/abs/lsa201234a.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&amp;context=mech_fac&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&amp;context=mech_fac&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jap.aip.org/resource/1/japiau/v113/i1/p011301_s1?bypassSSO=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khullar|first1=Vikrant|display-authors=4|last2=Tyagi|first2=Himanshu|last3=Hordy|first3=Nathan|last4=Otanicar|first4=Todd P.|last5=Hewakuruppu|first5=Yasitha|last6=Modi|first6=Poojan|last7=Taylor|first7=Robert A.|title=Harvesting solar thermal energy through nanofluid-based volumetric absorption systems|journal=International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer|volume=77|pages=377–384|doi= 10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2014.05.023|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Amir Moradi |author2=Elisa Sani |author3=Marco Simonetti |author4=Franco Francini |author5=Eliodoro Chiavazzo |author6=Pietro Asinari |last-author-amp=yes| title = Carbon-nanohorn based nanofluids for a direct absorption solar collector for civil application (Carbon-nanohorn Nanofluids) | doi= 10.1166/jnn.2015.9837 |volume=15 |journal=Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology |pages=3488–3495}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nanofluids have recently found relevance in applications requiring quick and effective heat transfer such as industrial applications, cooling of microchips, microscopic fluidic applications, etc. Moreover, in contrast to conventional heat transfer (for solar thermal applications) like water, ethylene glycol, and molten salts, nanofluids are not transparent to solar radiant energy; instead, they absorb and scatter significantly the solar irradiance passing through them.&lt;ref&gt;http://thermalscienceapplication.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1690805&lt;/ref&gt;
Typical solar collectors use a black-surface absorber to collect the sun's heat energy which is then transferred to a [[fluid]] running in tubes embedded within. Various limitations have been discovered with these configuration and alternative concepts have been addressed. Among these, the use of nanoparticles suspended in a liquid is the subject of research.  Nanoparticle materials including [[aluminium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dongsheng Wen |author2=Yulong Ding| title = Experimental investigation into the pool boiling heat transfer of aqueous based γ-alumina nanofluids |journal=Journal of Nanoparticle Research |date=2005| volume= 7| issue= 2-3| pages =265–274 | doi=10.1007/s11051-005-3478-9|bibcode=2005JNR.....7..265W}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[copper]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Min-Sheng Liu |author2= Mark Ching-Cheng Lin |author3= C.Y.

== Background ==

[[File:Types of solar collectors.png|thumb|Fig 1 :Different types of solar collector geometry]]
[[File:Comparison of heat transfer coefficients.jpg|thumb|Fig 2 : Comparison of heat transfer coefficients]]
Dispersing trace amounts of nanoparticles into common base fluids has a significant impact on the [[optical]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1556-276X-6-225/fulltext.html | doi=10.1186/1556-276X-6-225 | volume=6 | title=Nanofluid optical property characterization: towards efficient direct absorption solar collectors | journal=Nanoscale Research Letters | pages=225 | pmid=21711750 | pmc=3211283 | year=2011 |vauthors=Taylor RA, Phelan PE, Otanicar TP, Adrian R, Prasher R | bibcode=2011NRL.....6..225T }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as thermo physical properties of base [[fluid]]. This characteristic can be used to effectively capture and transport [[solar radiation]]. Enhancement of the solar irradiance absorption capacity leads to a higher heat transfer resulting in more efficient [[heat transfer]] as shown in figure 2.
The [[efficiency]] of a solar [[thermal]] system is reliant on several [[energy]] conversion steps, which are in turn governed by the effectiveness of the [[heat transfer]] processes. While higher conversion [[efficiency]] of solar to thermal energy is possible, the key components that need to be improved are the [[solar thermal collector|solar collector]]. An ideal [[solar thermal collector|solar collector]] will absorb the concentrated solar radiation, convert that incident solar radiation into heat and transfer the heat to the heat transfer fluid. Higher the heat transfer to fluid, higher is the outlet temperature and higher temp lead to improved conversion efficiency in the [[Thermodynamic cycle#Thermodynamic power cycles|power cycle]].
nanoparticles have several orders of magnitude higher [[heat transfer coefficient]] when transferring heat immediately to the surrounding fluid. This is simply due to the small size of [[nanoparticle]].

== Thermal conductivity of nanofluids ==

[[File:Thermal conductivity of different materials.jpg|thumb|Fig 3 :Thermal conductivity of different materials]]
We know that [[thermal conductivity]] of [[solids]] is greater than [[liquids]]. Commonly used [[fluids]] in [[heat transfer]] applications such as [[water]], [[ethylene glycol]] and [[engine oil]] have low [[thermal conductivity]] when compared to thermal conductivity of solids, especially [[metals]]. So, addition of solid particles in a fluid can increase the conductivity of liquids .But we cannot add large solid particles due to main problems:
*[[Mixtures]] are unstable and hence, [[sedimentation]] occurs.
*Presence of large solid particles also require large pumping power and hence increased cost.
*[[Solid]] particles may also [[erosion|erode]] the channel walls.
Due to these drawbacks, usage of solid particles have not become practically feasible.
Recent improvements in nanotechnology made it possible to introduce small solid particles with [[diameter]] smaller than 10&amp;nbsp;nm. Liquids, thus obtained have higher thermal conductivity and are known as [[Nanofluids]]. As can be clearly seen from figure 4 that carbon nanotubes have highest [[thermal conductivity]] as compared to other materials.

== Mechanism for enhanced thermal conductivity of nanofluids ==

Keblinski et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=P.keblinski, K.C.Leong, C.Yang|title= Investigations of thermal conductivity and viscosity of nanofluids, International Journal of Thermal Science(2006)}}&lt;/ref&gt; had named four main possible mechanisms for the anomalous increase in nanofluids heat transfer which are :

=== Brownian motion of nanoparticles ===

Due to Brownian motion particles randomly move through liquid. And hence better transport of heat.
Brownian motion increased mode of heat transfer.

=== Liquid layering at liquid/particle interface ===

Liquid molecules can form a layer around the solid particles and there by enhance the local  ordering of the atomic structure at the interface region.hence, the atomic structure of such liquid layer is more ordered than that of the bulk liquid.

=== Effect of nano-particles clustering ===

The effective volume of a [[cluster (physics)|cluster]] is considered much larger than the volume of the particles due to the lower [[Packing density|packing fraction]] of the cluster. Since, heat can be transferred rapidly within the such clusters, the [[volume fraction]] of the highly [[conductive]] [[phase (matter)|phase]] is larger than the volume of solid, thus increasing its thermal conductivity

== Comparison ==

In the last ten years, many experiments have been conducted numerically and analytically to validate the importance of nanofluids.
[[File:Comparison of Conventional fluids and Nano fluids.jpg|thumb|Table 1 :Comparison of Conventional fluids and Nano fluids]]
From the table 1&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vikrant Khullar |author2=Himanshu Tyagi  |last-author-amp=yes|title=Application of nano fluids as the working fluids in concentrating parabolic collector, Proceedings of the 37th National conferences Fluid mechanics and Fluid Power December 16–18, IIT Madras}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is clear that nanofluid-based collector have a higher efficiency than a conventional collector. So, it is clear that we can improve conventional collector simply by adding trace amounts of nano-particles.
It has also been observed through [[numerical analysis|numerical]] simulation that mean outlet [[temperature]] increase by increasing volume fraction of nanoparticles, length of tube and decreases by decreasing velocity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

== Benefits of use of nanofluids in solar collectors ==

Nanofluids poses the following advantages as compared to conventional fluids which makes them suitable for use in solar collectors:
*Absorption of solar energy will be maximized with change of the size, shape, material and [[volume fraction]] of the nanoparticles.
*The suspended nanoparticles increase the [[surface area]] but decrease the [[heat capacity]] of the fluid due to the very small particle size.
*The suspended nanoparticles enhance the thermal conductivity which results improvement in efficiency of heat transfer systems.
*Properties of fluid can be changed by varying [[concentration]] of nanoparticles.
*Extremely small size of nanoparticles ideally allows them to pass through pumps.
*[[Nanofluid]] can be optically selective (high absorption in the solar range and low [[Radiant emittance|emittance]] in the [[infrared]].)
The fundamental difference between the conventional and nanofluid-based collector lies in the mode of heating of the working fluid. In the former case the sunlight is absorbed by a surface, where as in the latter case the sunlight is directly absorbed by the working fluid (through [[radiative transfer]]). On reaching the receiver the solar radiations transfer [[energy]] to the [[nanofluid]] via [[scattering]] and [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]].

'''''Nuclear Weapons: The Road to Zero''''' is a 1998 book edited by [[Joseph Rotblat]].  The book is based on the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]], and in particular on a detailed international study published in 1993 on the importance of, and practical mechanisms to, eliminate nuclear weapons. This monograph is a series of essays that describe the many complex technical, economic, legal and political issues involved.  Contrary to the approach of nuclear powers -- that these weapons are needed for national security -- is the "no longer fanciful dream" of a nuclear-weapon-free world. Rotblat suggests that this is "a sound and practical objective, which could be realized in the foreseeable future."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/id.2431,content.true,css.print/bookshelf.aspx  Resetting the Clock]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/sep25/articles28.htm  Nuclear Weapons: The Road to Zero]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''powder snow avalanche''' is a type of [[avalanche]] where the snow grains are largely or wholly suspended by fluid turbulence. They are particle-laden gravity currents&lt;ref&gt;Simpson JE. 1997. Gravity currents in the environment and the laboratory. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and closely related to [[turbidity current]]s, [[pyroclastic flow]]s from [[volcanoes]] and [[dust storm]]s in the desert. The turbulence is typically generated by the forward motion of the current along the lower boundary of the domain, the motion being in turn driven by the action of gravity on the density difference between the particle-fluid mixture and the ambient fluid. The ambient fluid is generally of similar composition to (and miscible with) the interstitial fluid, and is water for turbidity currents and air for avalanches. These flows are non-conservative in that they may exchange particles at the lower boundary by deposition or  suspension, and may exchange fluid with the ambient by entrainment or detrainment. Such flows dissipate when the turbulence can no longer hold the particles in suspension and they are deposited on the lower boundary. When the turbulence is strong enough to suspend new material from the bed or the underlying dense flow then current is said to be auto-suspending.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnold RA. 1962. Auto-suspension of transported sediment: Turbidity currents. In Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series A, vol. 265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pantin HM. 1979. Interaction between velocity and effective density in turbidity flow; phase-plane analysis, with criteria for autosuspension. Marine Geology 31:59--99&lt;/ref&gt; Particle concentrations in the suspension cloud are usually sufficiently low (0.1-7% by volume) that particle-particle interactions play a small or negligible role in maintaining the suspension.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnold RA. 1954. Experiments on gravity free dispersion of large solid spheres in a Newtonian fluid under stress. In Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series A, vol. 225&lt;/ref&gt; In powder snow avalanches, even at these low concentrations, the extra density of the suspended particles is large relative to that of air, so the Boussinesq approximation, where density differences are considered negligible in inertia terms, is invalid, so that the snow grains carry most of the flows momentum. This is in contrast to turbidity currents and laboratory experiments in water where the extra inertia of the particles can usually be neglected. Nonetheless, due to the extreme difficulty in estimating particle concentrations in natural flows there remains considerable uncertainty—and debate—concerning the particle loading in large submarine turbidity currents and the validity of the Boussinesq approximation.

The '''proton pack''' is an  [[Raygun|energy weapon]] used for weakening [[ghosts]] and aiding in capturing them within the [[Ghostbusters (franchise)|''Ghostbusters'' universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= A Ghost-Zapping Device Is the Season's Stunner|work= The New York Times|date=1987-12-25|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/25/business/a-ghost-zapping-device-is-the-season-s-stunner.html?scp=2&amp;sq=The%20Real%20Ghostbusters&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; First depicted in the film ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', it has a hand-held wand ("Neutrona Wand" or particle thrower) connected to a backpack-sized [[particle accelerator]]. It fires a stream of highly focused and radially polarized [[proton]]s that electrostatically traps the negatively charged energy of a ghost, allowing it to be held in the stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Gregory | last1=Bergman | first2=Josh | last2=Lambert | title=Geektionary: From Anime to Zettabyte, An A to Z Guide to All Things Geek | page=228 | publisher=Adams Media | year=2011 | isbn=978-1440511141 | ref=geektionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the ''Ghostbusters'' universe==
The proton pack, designed by [[Egon Spengler|Dr. Egon Spengler]], is a man-portable [[particle accelerator]] system that is used to create a [[charged particle beam]]—composed of protons—that is fired by the proton gun (also referred to as the "[[neutrona]] wand"). Described in the first movie as a "[[electron-positron collider|positron collider]]", it functions by colliding high-energy positrons to generate its proton beam. The beam allows a Ghostbuster to contain and hold "negatively charged [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]]ic entities". This containment ability allows the wielder to position a ghost above a trap for capture.&lt;ref name="Ghostbusters"&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Ivan Reitman|Reitman, Ivan]] (Director), [[Dan Aykroyd|Aykroyd, Dan]] and [[Harold Ramis|Ramis, Harold]] (Writers) |date= 1984-07-08| title= Ghostbusters |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087332/ |medium= Motion picture |publisher= |location = |accessdate= 2009-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''proton pack'' is not used in the [[Ghostbusters|original movie]] at all,{{sfn|Bergman, Lambert|2011|p=229|ref=geektionary}} and is not used until the subway tunnel scene in ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', when Egon says that they should get their proton packs. The doorman to the Mayor's mansion also uses the term ''proton pack'', asking the Ghostbusters if he can buy one from them for his little brother. Egon replies that "A proton pack is not a toy".

In the 1984 novelization of ''Ghostbusters'' the Proton Packs are mention eg. “Stantz hauls out the formidable weaponry from the back of the Ectomobile and the four men kit themselves up, buckling on their proton packs…”&lt;ref&gt;"Ghostbusters - A novel based on the screenplay by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Raims" by Larry Milne. Cornet 1984. {{ISBN|0-340-37251-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Ghostbusters' dialogue indicates that the accelerator system operates similarly to a [[cyclotron]] (and indeed Dr. [[Peter Venkman]] refers to the proton packs in one scene as "unlicensed nuclear accelerators"),&lt;ref name="Ghostbusters" /&gt; modern particle accelerators produce well [[collimated]] particle beams.&lt;ref&gt;[[Particle accelerator]]&lt;!-- I know this in unacceptable, but the fact is referenced in the lead, and I can't seem to find a citation for it. If you do, feel free to add it.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is far different from the beam from a proton pack, which tends to undulate wildly (though it still stays within the general area at which the user is aiming). The proton stream is quite destructive to physical objects, and can cause extensive property damage.&lt;ref name="Ghostbusters" /&gt;

In the [[Ghostbusters: The Video Game|2009 ''Ghostbusters'' game]], Ray explains how the proton pack works early in the game; the energy emitted by the proton stream helps to dissipate [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] (PK) energy which ghosts use to manifest themselves. Draining them of their PK energy weakens them, allowing them to be captured in their portable ghost traps.

According to a line spoken by Egon in ''Ghostbusters II'', each pack's energy cell has a [[half-life]] of 5,000 years.&lt;ref name="Ghostbusters2"&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Ivan Reitman|Reitman, Ivan]] (Director), [[Dan Aykroyd|Aykroyd, Dan]] and [[Harold Ramis|Ramis, Harold]] (Writers) |date= 1989-07-16| title= Ghostbusters II |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097428/ |medium= Motion picture |publisher= |location = |accessdate= 2009-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knobs on the main stock of the proton pack can perform various functions to customize the proton stream, including adjustments for stream intensity, length, and degrees of [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]].{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} In the cartoon series ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'', the maximum power setting for the proton packs is "500,000 MHz," which possibly refers to the rate of positron collisions occurring within the pack's accelerator system. In the cartoon the packs also have a self-destruct mechanism capable of affecting at least a half-mile radius. ''The Real Ghostbusters'' and the ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]'' also made proton packs less efficient with power cells, allowing them to run out of energy when appropriate for dramatic tension; in the latter show, the proton packs require replaceable power cartridges.&lt;ref name="RealBusters"&gt;{{cite video |date= 1986| title= The Real Ghostbusters |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090506/ |medium= Television show |accessdate= 2009-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] monthly ''Ghostbusters'' comic storyline has shown the movie pack, a boson dart capable pack and the Extreme Ghostbusters pack in use. The IDW comic also shows a proton pistol attachment to the movie pack being used by Winston while hunting down Slimer.

===Crossing the streams===
{{quote|There's something very important I forgot to tell you! Don't cross the streams… It would be bad… Try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light.|Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) on crossing proton streams}}

Crossing the streams was initially discouraged, as Egon believed that "total protonic reversal" would occur: this effect would have catastrophic results (see quote above). However, in a desperate effort to stop the powerful [[Ghostbusters (franchise)#Gozer|Gozer the Gozerian]], Egon noted that the door to Gozer's temple "swings both ways" and that by crossing the streams, they may be able to create enough force to close the door on Gozer and its control. As the Ghostbusters cross the streams, the combination of that much energy closes the door to Gozer's dimension and severs its ties to our world. The resulting blast destroys a good portion of the roof and blows up the [[Stay Puft Marshmallow Man]].&lt;ref name="Ghostbusters" /&gt;

In ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'', the Ghostbusters mention that "crossing the streams" during the Gozer Incident (events of the first ''Ghostbusters'' film) only worked due to the presence of a cross-dimension portal (a tactic which is referred to as the "Gozer gambit" by Ray) and should only be used as a last resort. During the game's climax, the Ghostbusters are pulled into Ivo Shandor's ghostly realm and come face-to-face with Shandor's Destructor form, forcing them to resort to "crossing the streams" to defeat Shandor. The resulting blast not only destroys Shandor but also sends the team flying back to their dimension. During gameplay, it is possible for the player to cross the streams with another Ghostbuster, but this will only cause a burst of energy to travel down the stream and deal a massive amount of damage to the player, also knocking them off their feet for a short time, due to a new "safety" that was installed on the neutrona wand.

==In ''Ghostbusters: The Video Game''==
The game features a modified version of the proton pack (an experimental prototype) which is given to the player (the Ghostbuster's new ''experimental equipment technician''/guinea pig) for field testing. This new proton pack is equipped with other features (and upgrades) besides the standard proton stream.

==As props in the real world==
The props representing proton packs were originally thought to have been made by the prop department of [[Columbia Pictures]]. Recent information coming from the auction of a hero proton pack in July 2012 revealed that the hero proton packs could have been made by [[Boss Film Studios]], a prop studio started by ILM veteran Richard Edlund.  They are made of molded [[fiberglass]] shells on [[aluminium]] backplates (or "motherboards") bolted to military surplus [[All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment|A.L.I.C.E.]] frames. The basic shape was sculpted from foam; later, a rubber mold was made of it, from which fiberglass shells were pulled. The "wand" had an extending barrel mechanism and the electronics were quite advanced for the time. They were then finished with various surplus 1960s resistors, pneumatic fittings, hoses and [[ribbon cable]], and surplus warning labels and custom-made metal fittings. The overall weight of these props is said to be around {{convert|35|lb|kg}}. These "hero" props were substituted in stunt scenes by flimsy foam rubber pulls from the same mould. The proton packs have a [[lightbar]] with 15 blue scrolling lights in a box on the left-hand side and 4 red lights in the circular "[[cyclotron]]" portion of the bottom of the prop that light up in rotation. The "wand" also featured numerous light features; the most elaborate versions had fluorescent [[bargraph]]s, [[incandescent bulb]]s, and [[strobing]] flashes in the tip for the visual effects crew to synchronize the 'streams' to.

The ''GB1'' Hero proton packs were fiberglass shells mounted on aluminum motherboards with LC-1 ALICE Frames and straps. These packs had many aluminum parts on them, including: aluminum Ion Arm and cap, booster tube, injector tubes, HGA, vacuum line, PPD, Beamline and filler tube, as well as the N-Filter. The wands for these packs were also fully aluminum, minus the resin grips. All these external parts were pop riveted to the shell, which was then, in turn, mounted to the motherboard via L-Brackets and bolts at the four corners of the pack.

The ''GB1'' stunt packs were packs that were cast in foam to be worn during physical stunts performed in the film. Many of the attached pieces of the hero packs are cast on to these packs in foam. These packs also featured static lights and were attached to plywood motherboards with different straps compared to the ''GB1'' heroes. Other than the bumper, wand and hosing/ribbon cable, everything was cast into the foam shell of the pack.

Some packs from'' [[Ghostbusters]]'' were used in the follow-up ''[[Ghostbusters II]]''; these packs were slightly redressed with a black crank knob and thinner ribbon cable. The angle of the gun, or "wand" mount was changed to pitch forward slightly, in order to make the prop easier for the actor to use. In addition to these redressed props, one of the originals was hastily cast as a buck to produce basic lightweight "midgrade" props (as a solution to complaints by the actors about the weight of the original prop). These midgrade pieces featured many details cast in as part of the mould, instead of separate fittings. The electronics and mechanisms were also cut down greatly, reducing the total weight. The original ''GB1'' props would appear in close-ups, the midgrade in all other scenes, and new rubber "stunt" packs were made for whenever the actor needed to take a fall.

The proton pack props from the ''Ghostbusters'' movies are some of the most wanted and collectible props ever made. Several ''GB2'' packs have surfaced for auction. In September 2004, one rubber stunt and one fiberglass midgrade prop were auctioned by [[Profiles in History]]. The midgrade prop fetched well over $13,000. The "semi-hero" pack, affectionately known as "Number Four", was bought from the auction winner by Ken Heugel for cash and a Sean Bishop replica pack.  The auction winner kept the Certificate of Authenticity. The "Number 4" pack was dissected and documented by Bishop and Heugel. The examination revealed much of the hurried and shoddy casting and assembly techniques used in its creation. The measurements of the proton pack taken during the examination are still used today by prop builders making their own proton packs. Unfortunately, "Number 4" was lost in 2005 during Heugel's move to Romania. The case that held the pack arrived in Romania empty. This theft was classified as "an airline baggage mishap". In July 2006, another ''Ghostbusters II'' mid-grade "semi-hero" pack with a Certificate of Authenticity was placed on auction by Profiles in History. This proton pack was later pulled when it was determined to be the Bishop replica pack matched with the real Certificate of Authenticity of the "Number 4".  This replica pack is distinct for its unusually rusty paint job.  In 2011 this pack was recovered when author Ernie Cline (''Fanboys'', ''Ready Player One'') purchased it, returning it to Bishop's shop for a makeover prior to Cline's use of it on his 2011-2012 book signing tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ernestcline.com/blog/2011/08/19/the-geekiest-book-tour-ever-part-v-an-unlicensed-nuclear-accelerator/|title=The Geekiest Book Tour Ever – Part V: An Unlicensed Nuclear Accelerator - Ernie's Blog|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three variations of the ''GB2'' pack have been displayed at various [[Planet Hollywood]] restaurants around the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Ghostbusters Revisited |author= Eisenberg, Adam |url= http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Lot/2976/ghostrevisited1.html |year= 1989 |work= [[Cinefex]] |accessdate=14 September 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023194602/http://geocities.com/Hollywood/Lot/2976/ghostrevisited1.html|archivedate=2009-10-23}}&lt;!-- I understand that this is not a reliable source, however it is transcribed from a reliable source which I can't seem to find an online source of. If you can find one, please cite it. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Hero packs in ''GB2'' were the same hero packs from ''GB1'' but retrofitted so they had matching parts with the new packs they had to construct for filming. For all intents and purposes, these packs are built the same way, only with some cosmetic differences, such as different ribbon cables, different colored crank knob, the use of nycoil banjos on the wands, etc. Other than that, they are just beat up versions of their former selves from the first film.

Here are some obvious and subtle modifications done to the hero packs for ''GB2'':
# The unique ribbon cable was replaced with regular [[Spectra Strip]] cable.
# The grey crank knobs were replaced with black ones (or simply painted).
# The V-hook on the gun mount was slightly angled forward on some packs (for ease of drawing).
# The LC-1 A.L.I.C.E. frames were replaced with LC-2 versions (painted black).
# Extra padding (commonly called "Super Straps") was added to the straps on some [[A.L.I.C.E.]] frames.
# The [[Legris]] banjos on the [[Neutrona]] Wand were replaced with [[Nycoil]] banjos.
# The packs were heavily weathered (not sure how intentional that was, though).
# The [[Ion Arm]] Cap was heavily weathered on most packs (this is useful in identifying different packs).
# The Ion Arm Rods were stripped of their black paint.
# The square [[Clippard]] elbow on the Ion Arm Cap was removed, and a hex elbow was installed on the Ion Arm itself.
# All the ''GB1'' tubing was Clippard brand - ''GB2'' used Nycoil and some Clippard.
# The socket head cap screws connecting the shell to the mother board were replaced with button head cap screws.
# The mesh inside of the N-filter was replaced with a white covering.

The Semi-Hero packs in ''GB2'' were a new addition to the packs used in filming. These packs were stripped-down versions of the heroes, merging constructional concepts from both the heroes and the stunt packs into a mid grade pack for wide shots. These packs were also constructed lighter for the actors. many of the metal parts from the Hero packs were cast in resin and attached to the shell, such as the HGA, injector tubes, beamline and filler tube. Other metal parts, such as the Ion Arm, Booster Tube (and frame), PPD, and N-Filter, were actually cast into the shell, much like the foam stunt packs from the first film. These packs also had fiberglass cast wands, instead of the metal ones from the first film.

The ''GB2'' foam stunt packs seem to have been built somewhat better than the ''GB1'' foam stunt packs. The foam packs seem to be constructed the same way as the semi-heroes but instead of being cast as fiberglass, they were cast in foam instead. Once again, the Ion Arm, Booster Tube (and frame), PPD and N-Filter were cast onto the shell and part of the mold.

Besides the video game, there is one more instance of Columbia/Sony having packs produced for production. That would be the packs made for the Universal Studios Florida stage show. As to how much lineage these packs actually have is still up in the air. If the master for these mold was retooled from a production mold, it was heavily modified. There is much extra material added around the EDA, both where the beamline and filler tubes go, as well as between the injector tubes and the EDA. At least the bottom half of the Booster tube and frame are cast into the shell as well as the N-Filter. There also seems to be much warpage at this point. These packs were also mounted on what seems like MDF motherboards and LC-2 ALICE frames.

The proton pack worn by Bill Murray during his acceptance speech at the 2010 Scream Awards was a reproduction semi-hero pack made by Bishop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbfans.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=37&amp;t=22466 GBFans Forum: Bill Murray attends Scream Awards, sets internet aflame] Retrieved 31 December 2011.&lt;!-- I understand this is not a reliable source, but the fan source is the best I can find. We need a none fan website related link here, but the information is true. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, [[Profiles in History]] auctioned a ''Ghostbusters'' hero pack.  This proton pack was reportedly worn by Harold Ramis.  The source of the pack is suspected to be Sony.  This "Harold Pack" shows some modifications made to the hero packs from ''Ghostbusters''  to ''Ghostbusters II''.  The Harold Pack also showed some damaged and missing parts, most notably a missing crank knob and a broken N-Filter.  There is also a clear tube from the ''Ghostbusters'' uniform shown with the Harold Pack.  It is unknown if the electronics inside the pack are in working order.  The "Harold Pack" sold for $130,000.  The same Profiles in History auction also features the ''Ghostbusters'' ghost trap and pedal used when Slimer is captured in the hotel ballroom.  This "Slimer Trap" is supposed to have a working pedal mechanism, but the operational status is also unknown.  The "Slimer Trap" sold for $60,000.

Many movie prop replica communities (prop forums) have sprung up regarding proton pack research and contain various methods and plans for constructing a replica proton pack.  Plans, methods, parts and advice can be obtained from the members of these prop forums to help build a proton pack out of simple cardboard to movie accurate aluminum and fiberglass (shell) hero-pack replicas.  Some of the more complex proton pack replicas being built have with lights and sound.  These prop forums also have information on other ''Ghostbusters'' props from the ghost trap, to the slime blower, to the [[Ectomobile]].  Some of these prop forums also have members that sell replica shells, motherboards and other parts necessary to make a replica proton pack.

Early script descriptions of the proton pack stated each pack had two neutrona wands, strapped to the wrists, rather than one held in a fashion similar to an [[assault rifle]].{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} Toy proton packs were formerly made by [[Kenner]] and became available in toy shops. They consisted of a plastic hollow pack and gun, with a yellow foam cylinder attached to the front of the gun to represent the beam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Real Ghostbusters Proton Pack &amp; Ghost Popper Commercial |author= GhostbustersDotNet |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6UpvqDa-OE |year= 1989 |accessdate=24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4021">'''Proton tunneling''' is a type of [[quantum tunneling]] involving the instantaneous disappearance of a [[proton]] in one site and the appearance of the same proton at an adjacent site separated by a potential barrier. The two available sites are bounded by a double well potential of which its shape, width and height are determined by a set of boundary conditions. According to the [[WKB approximation]], the probability for a particle to tunnel is inversely proportional to its mass and the width of the potential barrier. [[Electron tunneling]] is well-known. A proton is about 2000 times more massive than an [[electron]], so it has a much lower probability of tunneling; nevertheless, proton tunneling still occurs especially at low temperatures and high pressures where the width of the potential barrier is decreased.

Proton tunneling is usually associated to [[hydrogen bond]]s. In many molecules that contain hydrogen, the hydrogen atoms are linked to two non-hydrogen atoms via a hydrogen bond at one end and a covalent bond at the other. A hydrogen atom without its electron is reduced to being a proton. Since the electron is no longer bound to the hydrogen atom in a hydrogen bond, this is equivalent to a proton resting in one of the wells of a double well potential as described above. When proton tunneling occurs, the hydrogen bond and covalent bonds are switched. Once proton tunneling occurs, the same proton has the same probability of tunneling back to its original site provided the double well potential is symmetrical.

The [[base pairs]] of a [[DNA]] strand are connected by [[hydrogen bond#Hydrogen bonds in DNA and proteins|hydrogen bonds]]. In essence, the genetic code is contained by a unique arrangement of hydrogen bonds. It is believed that upon the replication of a DNA strand there is a probability for proton tunneling to occur which changes the hydrogen bond configuration; this leads to a slight alteration of the hereditary code which is the basis of mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=P. O. |last=Löwdin |title=Proton Tunneling in DNA and its Biological Implications |journal=Rev. Mod. Phys. |volume=35 |pages=724 |year=1963 |doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.35.724 |bibcode=1963RvMP...35..724L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, proton tunneling is also believed to be responsible for the occurrence of the dysfunction of cells (tumors and cancer) and ageing.

Proton tunneling occurs in many hydrogen based molecular crystals such as ice. It is believed that the phase transition between the hexagonal ([[ice Ih]]) and orthorhombic ([[ice XI]]) phases of ice is enabled by proton tunneling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A.

A '''reactor building''' is a general term for a building that houses a reactor of some type. In particular, it often refers to a building containing a [[nuclear reactor]]. This can also be used to refer to pressure sealed buildings containing [[nuclear reactor]]s, though it would be more correct to call them [[containment building]]s.

Although some buildings containing [[nuclear reactor]]s are [[containment building]]s, not all are. For instance, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[RBMK]] reactors were not housed in [[containment building]]s. This greatly increased the severity of the [[Chernobyl accident]] on April 26, 1986.

[[Renewable electricity]] in [[New Zealand]] is primarily from [[hydropower]]. In 2015, 83% of the electricity generated in New Zealand came from renewable sources.&lt;ref name="MBIE"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/energy/energy-data-modelling/publications/new-zealand-energy-quarterly| title=New Zealand Energy Quarterly| date=17 March 2016| publisher=[[Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment|MBIE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, former [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Helen Clark]] announced a national target of 90% renewable electricity by 2025, with [[wind energy]] to make up much of that increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Clark| first=Helen| url= http://www.beehive.govt.nz/node/30691| title=Launch of emissions trading scheme| publisher=New Zealand Government| date=2007-09-20| accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[resource consent]] process has favoured non-renewable energy projects.  This century, thermal projects have received consents ([[Rodney Power Station|Rodney]], [[Stratford Power Station|Stratford]]) while several renewable energy projects have had consent applications declined ([[Awhitu Wind Farm|Awhitu]], [[King Country Energy|Mokau hydro]], [[Mount Cass Wind Farm|Mount Cass]], [[Project Hayes]], [[Te Waka Wind Farm|Te Waka]], [[Waitahora Wind Farm|Waitahora]]).

=== Geothermal power ===
{{main|Geothermal power in New Zealand}}
Geothermal power is a significant part of the electrical energy generation capacity of the country, providing approximately 16% of the country's electricity with installed capacity of 971 [[Megawatt|MW]].&lt;ref name="Energy2015"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/energy/energy-data-modelling/publications/energy-in-new-zealand| title=Energy in New Zealand 2015| publisher=[[Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment|MBIE]]| date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand, like only a small number of other countries worldwide, has numerous geothermal sites that could be developed for exploitation, and also boasts some of the earliest large-scale use of geothermal energy in the world.

=== Wind power ===
{{main|Wind power in New Zealand}}
As of December 2014, New Zealand had an installed wind generation capacity of 683 MW.&lt;ref name="Energy2015" /&gt; The first generation of [[Wind power]] into the national grid was in 1992 and it now provides approximately 5% of the country's electricity demand.&lt;ref name="Energy2015" /&gt; Consents have been granted for [[wind farm]]s with a further capacity of 2,200 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.windenergy.org.nz/consented-wind-farms| title=Consented Wind Farms| publisher=New Zealand Wind Energy Association| accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ocean power ===
{{main|Ocean power in New Zealand}}
[[New Zealand]] has large [[ocean energy]] resources but does not yet generate any power from them. [[TVNZ]] reported in 2007 that over 20 [[Wave power|wave]] and [[tidal power]] projects are currently under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/536641/1474541|title=Tidal power rides wave of popularity|publisher=TVNZ|date=2 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not a lot of public information is available about these projects. The [[Aotearoa Wave and Tidal Energy Association]] was established in 2006 to "promote the uptake of marine energy in New Zealand". According to their latest newsletter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awatea.org.nz/newsletters/issue2_10Feb2008.pdf|title=AWATEA newsletter|date=10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have 59 members. However the association doesn't list these members or provide any details of projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awatea.org.nz/|title=Aotearoa Wave and Tidal Energy Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
From 2008 to 2011, the government [[Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority]] is allocating $2 million each year from a Marine Energy Deployment Fund, set up to encourage the utilisation of this resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeca.govt.nz/renewable-energy/marine.html|publisher=Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority|title=Marine Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greater [[Cook Strait]] and [[Kaipara Harbour]] seem to offer the most promising sites for using underwater turbines. Two resource consents have been granted for pilot projects in Cook Strait itself and in the [[Tory Channel]], and consent has been granted for up to 200 tidal turbines at the [[Kaipara Tidal Power Station]]. Other potential locations include the [[Manukau Harbour|Manukau]] and [[Hokianga Harbour]]s, and [[French Pass]]. The harbours produce currents up to 6 [[Knot (unit)|knots]] with tidal flows up to 100,000 cubic metres a second. These tidal volumes are 12 times greater than the flows in the largest New Zealand rivers.

A glance at these figures shows that for the stated target to be attained, current thermal generation will have to be decommissioned and not replaced. Even if the annual total consumption doubles from the 2005 figure ( as it did from 1975 to 2005 ), with all additional generation met by non-thermal means, a static thermal generation of 14,305 on a total of 83,340 is still 17 percent. The most likely candidate for decommissioning would be the 1000 [[Watt|MW]] [[Huntly power station]], a [[coal]] and gas power station that was commissioned in 1983.

While there are some non-technical barriers to the widespread use of renewables, [[global warming]] concerns coupled with high oil prices and increasing government support are driving increasing growth in the renewable energy industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.govt.nz/upload/52164/nzes.pdf|title=New Zealand Energy Strategy to 2050: Towards a sustainable low emissions energy system|publisher=MED}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To boost the renewables ratio, [[geothermal power]] is counted as renewable, although the geothermal heat reservoirs are eventually depleted (observably so at [[Wairakei#Geothermal field|Wairakei]], the longest-running{{Fact|date=May 2012}}) and they are not emissions-free. For example, the [[Ngawha geothermal field]] emits an unusually high amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (350 tonnes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per GWh &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energyinfonz.co.nz/home/IndustryOverview/Resources/Geothermal.htm|title=Geothermal|publisher=Energyinfo|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619060936/http://www.energyinfonz.co.nz/home/IndustryOverview/Resources/Geothermal.htm|archivedate=2008-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the geothermal fields plus natural hot springs draining to the [[Waikato river]] deliver sufficient [[arsenic]] to render the water unsafe to drink without special treatment{{Fact|date=October 2008}}. Re-injection of the waste geothermal fluid can reduce these problems (even extending the life of the field), but involves additional expense.

'''Silverstone''' is a [[non-stick]] [[plastic coating]] made by [[DuPont]]. Released in 1976, this three-coat (primer/midcoat/topcoat) [[fluoropolymer]] system formulated with [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] and PFA produces a more durable finish than [[Teflon]] coating.

A reinforced version with higher scratch and abrasion resistance is also available. Maximum continuous use temperature is 290°C (550°F).

==What is Teflon==

Teflon is DuPont's registered trademark for its non-stick coatings. Teflon coatings are specially formulated finishes that are based on PTFE, PFA, FEP, and ETFE fluorocarbon resins. Teflon-S is a related family of fluorocarbon coatings containing binding resins which provide increased hardness, abrasion resistance, and other desirable properties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plastechcoatings.com/teflon_coating.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Slinky''' is a [[toy]] precompressed [[helix|helical]] [[Spring (device)|spring]] invented by [[Richard T. James|Richard James]] in the early 1940s. It can perform a number of tricks, including travelling down a flight of steps end-over-end as it stretches and re-forms itself with the aid of gravity and its own momentum, or appear to levitate for a period of time after it has been dropped. These interesting characteristics have contributed to its success as a toy in its home country of the United States, resulting in many popular toys with slinky components in a wide range of countries.

==History==
[[Andy Davis']] in 1943 and demonstrated at [[Gimbels]] department store in [[Philadelphia]] in November 1945. The toy was a hit, selling its entire inventory of 400 units in ninety minutes. James and his wife [[Betty James|Betty]] formed James Industries in [[Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania]] to manufacture Slinky and several related toys such as the Slinky Dog and Suzie, the Slinky Worm. In 1960, James's wife Betty became president of James Industries, and, in 1964, moved the operation back to [[Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania]]. In 1998, Betty James sold the company to Poof Products, Inc.

Slinky was originally priced at $1, but many paid much more due to price increases of spring steel throughout the state of Pennsylvania; it has, however, remained modestly priced throughout its history as a result of Betty James' concern about the toy's affordability for poor customers. Slinky has been used other than as a toy in the playroom: it has appeared in the classroom as a teaching tool, in wartime as a radio antenna, and in physics experiments with NASA. Slinky was inducted into the [[National Toy Hall of Fame]] at [[The Strong]] in [[Rochester, New York]], in 2000. In 2002, Slinky became Pennsylvania's official state toy, and, in 2003, was named to the [[Toy Industry Association]]'s "[https://web.archive.org/web/20030401214230/http://www.toy-tia.org/industry/news/press/tf03_centuryoftoys.html Century of Toys List]." In its first 60 years Slinky sold 300 million units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Slinky Sprang Into Stores 70 Years Ago|url=http://time.com/4127170/slinky-70-years/|website=Time Inc.|accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation===
[[File:Slinky ad 1946.jpg|thumb|Slinky (1946)]]

In 1943, [[Richard T. James|Richard James]], a naval mechanical engineer stationed at the [[William Cramp &amp; Sons]] shipyards in Philadelphia, was developing springs that could support and stabilize sensitive instruments aboard ships in rough seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Business Leader Profiles for Students|editor1-first = Sheila |editor1-last=Dow |editor2-first= Jaime E. |editor2-last=Noce|volume=2|location=Detroit|publisher=Gale|year=2002|pages=238–241|isbn=978-0-7876-6615-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Toy Box Leadership: Leadership Lessons from the Toys You Loved as a Child  |last1=Hunter |first1=Ron |first2=Michael E. |last2=Waddell |year=2008 |publisher=Thomas Nelson |location=Nashville, Tennessee |isbn= 978-0-7852-2740-3|page=22 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oXIXhzaK-mMC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=slinky+history+navy&amp;cd=2#v=onepage |accessdate=2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; James accidentally knocked one of the springs from a shelf, and watched as the spring "stepped" in a series of arcs to a stack of books, to a tabletop, and to the floor, where it re-coiled itself and stood upright.&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/Invent/iow/slinky.html |title=Inventor of the Week: The Slinky |publisher=[[MIT School of Engineering]] |accessdate=2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt; James's wife Betty later recalled, "He came home and said, 'I think if I got the right property of steel and the right tension; I could make it walk.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Novel Ideas | first = John  | last =  Przybys  | url = http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/1998/Mar-01-Sun-1998/lifestyles/7021869.html | newspaper = Las Vegas Review-Journal | date = March 1, 1998 | accessdate = 2010-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; James experimented with different types of steel wire over the next year, and finally found a spring that would walk.  Betty was dubious at first, but changed her mind after the toy was fine-tuned and neighborhood children expressed an excited interest in it.&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt; She dubbed the toy Slinky (meaning "sleek and graceful"), after finding the word in a dictionary,&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt; and deciding that the word aptly described the sound of a metal spring expanding and collapsing.&lt;ref name="NYTimes3"&gt;{{cite news |last=Barnes |first=Julian E. |title=A Name, a Name, Destined for Fame |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=2001-01-28 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E5D7123FF93BA15752C0A9679C8B63 |accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a [[United States dollar|US$]]500 loan, the couple formed James Industries (originally James Spring &amp; Wire Company), had 400 Slinky units made by a local machine shop, hand-wrapped each in yellow paper, and priced them at $1 a piece.&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt;  Each was 2{{frac|1|2}}" tall, and included 98 coils of high-grade blue-black Swedish steel.&lt;ref name="Rich" /&gt;    The Jameses had difficulty selling Slinky to toy stores but, in November 1945, they were granted permission to set up an [[inclined plane]] in the toy section of [[Gimbels]] department store in Philadelphia to demonstrate the toy. Slinky was a hit, and the first 400 units were sold within ninety minutes.&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rich"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rich |first=Mark |title=Warman's 101 Greatest Baby Boomer Toys |publisher=KP Books |year=2005 |location=Iola, Wisconsin |pages=58–59 |isbn=0-89689-220-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, Slinky was introduced at the [[American International Toy Fair|American Toy Fair]].

===Subsequent developments===
Richard James opened shop in Albany, New York, after developing a machine that could produce a Slinky within seconds.&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rich" /&gt;  The toy was packaged in a black-lettered box, and advertising saturated America. James often appeared on television shows to promote Slinky. In 1952, the Slinky Dog debuted. Other Slinky toys introduced in the 1950s included the Slinky train Loco, the Slinky worm Suzie, and the Slinky Crazy Eyes, a pair of glasses that uses Slinkys over the eyeholes attached to plastic eyeballs.  James Industries licensed the patent to several other manufacturers including Wilkening Mfg. Co. of Philadelphia and Toronto which produced spring-centered toys such as Mr. Wiggle's Leap Frog and Mr. Wiggle's Cowboy.&lt;ref name="Rich" /&gt;  In its first 2 years, James Industries sold 100 million Slinkys (At $1 apiece, that would be the equivalent to 6 Billion, adjusted for inflation, in gross revenue over those 5 years).&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt;

In 1960 Richard James left the company after his wife filed for divorce and he became an evangelical missionary in [[Bolivia]] with [[Wycliffe Bible Translators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title='Slinky' brainchild |publisher=[[Delaware County Daily Times]] |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/19524766/ |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betty James managed the company, juggled creditors, and in 1964 moved the company to [[Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania]]. Richard James died in 1974. The company and its product line expanded under Betty James’s leadership.&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt; In 1995, she explained the toy's success to the [[Associated Press]] by saying, "It's the simplicity of it."&lt;ref name="Betty"&gt;{{cite news |title=Betty James, who cofounded Slinky company, dies |url=http://www.kxmb.com/getArticle.asp?ArticleId=300881 |accessdate=2009-02-25|date=2008-11-22|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[KXMB-TV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Betty James insisted upon keeping the original Slinky affordable. In 1996, when the price ranged from $1.89 to $2.69, she told ''[[The New York Times]]'': “So many children can’t have expensive toys, and I feel a real obligation to them. I’m appalled when I go Christmas shopping and $60 to $80 for a toy is nothing.” In 2008, Slinkys cost $4 to $5, and Slinky Dogs about $20.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

In 1998 James Industries was sold to Poof Products, Inc. of [[Plymouth, Michigan]], a manufacturer of foam sports balls.&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; Slinky continued production in Hollidaysburg.&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt; In 2003, James Industries merged with Poof Products, Inc., to create Poof-Slinky, Inc.

Betty James died of [[congestive heart failure]] in November 2008, age 90, after having served as president of James Industries from 1960 to 1998.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Betty James, Who Named the Slinky Toy, Is Dead at 90 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/business/25james.html |accessdate=2009-02-25|last=Hevesi|first= Dennis|publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 300 million Slinkys have been sold between 1945 and 2005, and the original Slinky is still a bestseller.&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rich" /&gt;

==Physical properties==
The rules that govern the mechanics of a slinky are [[Hooke's law]] and the effects of [[gravitation]].

===Period of oscillation===
Due to [[simple harmonic motion]] the period of oscillation of a dangling slinky is
:&lt;math&gt;T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Where ''T'' is the time of the period of oscillation, ''m'' is the mass of the slinky and ''k'' is the [[spring constant]] of the slinky.

===Equilibrium===
In the state of equilibrium of a slinky, all net force is cancelled throughout the entire slinky. This results in a stationary slinky with zero velocity. As the positions of each part of the slinky is governed by the slinky's mass, the force of gravity and the spring constant, various other properties of the slinky may be induced. The length of an idealized slinky extended under its own weight, assuming the fully compressed length is negligible, is
:&lt;math&gt;L = \frac{W}{2k}.&lt;/math&gt;
Where ''L'' is the length of the slinky, ''W'' is the weight of the slinky, and ''k'' is the spring constant of the slinky.

Due to the effect of gravity, the slinky appears bunched up towards the bottom end, as governed by the equation
:&lt;math&gt;p(n) = L(n-1)^2.&lt;/math&gt;
Where ''n'' is a dimensionless variable, 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;1, with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 corresponding to the top of the slinky and ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 being the bottom.  Each intermediate value of ''n'' corresponds to the proportion of the slinky's mass above that point ''n'', and ''p''(''n'') gives the position that ''n'' is above the bottom of the slinky.

This quadratic equation means that rather than the center of mass being at the middle of the slinky, it lies one quarter of the length above the bottom end,
:&lt;math&gt;p(\frac{1}{2}) = L(\frac{1}{2}-1)^2=\frac{L}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Phenomenon===

====Flight of stairs====
When set in motion on a stepped platform such as a stairway, the slinky transfers energy along its length in a longitudinal wave. The whole spring descends end over end in a periodical motion, as if it were somersaulting down one step at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Ikenson, Ben. Patents: Ingenious Inventions : How They Work and How They Came to Be.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Changing strength====

====Levitation====
When the top end of the Slinky is dropped, the information of the tension change must propagate to the bottom end before both sides begin to fall; the top of an extended Slinky will drop while the bottom initially remains in its original position, compressing the spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/09/26/slinky-drop-physics/ | title=Slinky drop physics - video of extended Slinky being dropped | publisher=Discover magazine | date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a suspension time of  ~0.3 s for an original Slinky,&lt;ref name="arXiv.free"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Modeling a falling slinky|arxiv=1208.4629|last=Cross|first=Rod C.|author2=Wheatland, Mike S. |date=22 Aug 2012|doi=10.1119/1.4750489|volume=80|issue=12|journal=American Journal of Physics|page=1051|bibcode=2012AmJPh..80.1051C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Journal.abstract"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cross|first=Rod C.|author2=Wheatland, Mike S. |title=Modeling a falling slinky|journal=American Journal of Physics|year=2012|volume=80|issue=12|pages=1051|doi=10.1119/1.4750489|publisher=American Association of Physics Teachers|arxiv=1208.4629|bibcode=2012AmJPh..80.1051C}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has potential to create a much larger suspension time.
A suspended Slinky's center of mass is accelerating downward at 16 feet per second (i.e. g); when released - the lower portion moves up toward the top portion with an equivalent, constant upward acceleration as the tension is relieved. As the spring contracts, every point along its length will accelerate downward with gravity and tension, and experience a decrease in overall downward acceleration related to height along the spring due to the spring force changing with extension- at the bottom of the spring the upward initial acceleration reduces in accordance with Hooke's law as the spring contracts, but the centre toward which it is moving gets closer- meaning the base will have been displaced sufficiently toward the centre of inertial mass for it to appear to have hung still. Should this phenomenology extend to very light strings with heavy suspended masses (which have approximately linear tension distributions), different mathematics would be needed to explain the phenomenon.

==Commercial history==

===Jingle===
The famous jingle for the Slinky television commercial was created in Columbia, South Carolina in 1962 with Johnny McCullough and Homer Fesperman writing the music and Charles Weagly penning the lyrics. It became the longest-running jingle in advertising history.&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;{{cite book | last = Walsh | first = Tim | year = 2005 | title = Timeless Toys: Classic Toys and the Playmakers Who Created Them | publisher = [[Andrews McMeel Publishing]] | isbn = 978-0-7407-5571-2 | pages = 62–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jingle has itself been parodied and referenced in popular culture. It is seen in the "Log" commercial on ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'' and sung by actor [[Jim Carrey]] in ''[[Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls]]''. The song is also referenced in the movie ''[[Lords of Dogtown]]'', where it is sung in full by [[Emile Hirsch]], and is sung by [[Eddie Murphy]] as part of the final routine in the stand-up comedy film ''[[Eddie Murphy Raw]]''.

===Slinky Dog===
[[File:We Made It - Thinktank Birmingham Science Museum - Slinky - Toy Story (8615032628).jpg|thumb|A Slinky Dog toy]]
Early in the history of James Industries, Helen (Herrick) Malsed of [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] sent the company a letter and drawings for developing Slinky pull-toys. The company liked her ideas, and Slinky Dog and Slinky Train were added to the company's product line. Slinky Dog, a small plastic dog whose front and rear ends were joined by a metal Slinky, debuted in 1952. Malsed received royalties of $60,000 to $70,000 annually for 17 years on her patent for the Slinky pull-toy idea, but never visited the plant.&lt;ref name="NYTimes2"&gt;{{cite news |last=McDowell |first=Edwin |title=Helen H. Malsed, 88, Creator of Slinky Toys |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=1998-11-28 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E3DB1139F93AA15752C1A96E958260 |accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 the Slinky Dog was redesigned for all of [[Pixar]]’s ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]''. James Industries had discontinued their Slinky Dog a few years previously. Betty James approved of the new Slinky Dog, telling the press, "The earlier Slinky Dog wasn’t nearly as cute as this one." The molds used in manufacturing the new toy created problems for James Industries, so the plastic front and rear ends were manufactured in China with James Industries doing the assembly and packaging. The entire run of 825,000 redesigned Slinky Dogs sold out well before Christmas 1995.&lt;ref name="NYTimes1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Witchel |first=Alex |date=1996-02-21 |title=Talking Toys with Betty James; Persevering for Family and Slinky |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E1D61339F932A15751C0A960958260 |accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plastic Slinky===
[[File:Slinky rainbow.jpg|thumb|Rainbow colored plastic Slinky toy]]
Plastic Slinkys are also available. They can be made in different colors. Many of them are made with the colors of the rainbow in rainbow order. They were marketed in the 1970s as a safer alternative to metal slinkys as they did not present a hazard when inserted into electrical sockets. The plastic spring toy, known as the Plastic Slinky was invented by Donald James Reum Sr. of Master Mark Plastics in Albany, Minnesota. Reum came up with the idea as he was playing with different techniques to produce a spiral hose for watering plants.  However, as it came off the assembly line, according to his children, it looked more like a "Slinky." He worked at it until it came out perfectly and then went to Betty James with his prototype. Reum manufactured the Plastic Slinky for Betty James for several years.  Eventually Betty James  decided to manufacture the product exclusively through James manufacturing, effectively ending the production of the toy by the small Minnesota company. Reum’s patent number, 4120929 was filed on Dec 28, 1976 and issued by the US Patent Office on Oct 17, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 4120929 | status = patent | fdate = 28 December 1976 | gdate = 17 October 1978 | title = Method for producing a spirally wound plastic article | invent1 = Reum, Donald James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In 1999, the United States Postal Service issued a Slinky postage stamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sourcebook for Receptive and Expressive Language  |publisher=Wayne State University Press |location=Detroit, Michigan |year=2006 |page=106 |isbn=0-8143-3314-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qO0s0Z52IYYC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=Slinky+postage+stamp |accessdate=2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Slinky was inducted into the [[National Toy Hall of Fame]] in 2000 in their [[Celebrate the Century]] stamp series. A bill to nominate the slinky as the [[List of U.S. state toys|state toy]] of [[Pennsylvania]] was introduced by [[Richard Geist]] in 2001 but not enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2001&amp;sind=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;BN=1893|title=Regular Session 2001–2002, House Bill 1893|publisher=[[Pennsylvania General Assembly]]|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Betty  James was inducted into the [[Toy Industry Association]]'s Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; In 2003, Slinky was named to the Toy Industry Association's "Century of Toys List", a roll call of the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Toy Industry Association Announces Its Century of Toys List |publisher=[[Business Wire]] for [[Toy Industry Association]] |date=2003-01-21 |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/manufacturing/miscellaneous-mfg-doll-toy-games-games/5673984-1.html |accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High school teachers and college professors have used Slinkys to simulate the properties of [[wave]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alex.state.al.us/lesson_view.php?id=24112|title=ALEX - Alabama Learning Exchange|website=alex.state.al.us|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://essap.tamu.edu/e3/docs/lesson-docs/waves_en.doc|title=Student Services - College of Engineering|first=Texas A&amp;M Engineering|last=Communications|date=31 January 2018|website=essap.tamu.edu|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States troops in the [[Vietnam War]] used them as mobile radio antennas {{Verification needed|date=June 2013}}(as have amateur radio operators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nonstopsystems.com/radio/frank_radio_antenna.htm|title=Slinky-coil dipole|website=www.nonstopsystems.com|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mw5hoc.4t.com/custom2.html&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[NASA]] has used them in zero-gravity physics experiments in the [[Space Shuttle]].&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt;

Slinkys and similar springs can be used to create a 'laser gun' like sound effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/experimentals/experiments/episode19_2.htm|title=the experiMENTALS: experiments - laser canon sound effect - The Lab - Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Gateway to Science|website=www.abc.net.au|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is done by holding up a slinky in the air and striking one end, resulting in a metallic tone which sharply lowers in pitch. The effect can be amplified by attaching a plastic cup to one end of the Slinky.

In 1959, [[John Cage]] composed an avant garde work called ''Sounds of Venice'' scored for (among other things) a piano, a slab of marble and Venetian broom, a birdcage of canaries, and an amplified Slinky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fetterman |first=William |title=John Cage's Theatre Pieces  |publisher=Routledge |year=1996 |page=36 |ISBN=3-7186-5642-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2QEWa2Ptfq8C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=John+Cage+Slinky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 in conjunction with the [[Johnson Space Center]] and the [[Houston Museum of Natural Science]], Discovery astronauts created a video demonstrating how familiar toys behave in space. "It won't slink at all," Dr. M. Rhea Seddon said of Slinky, "It sort of droops." The video was prepared to stimulate interest in school children about the basic principles of physics and the phenomenon of weightlessness.&lt;ref name="NYTimes4"&gt;{{cite news |title=Toy Time in Space |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=1985-04-16 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9B07E3DC1239F935A25757C0A963948260 |accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[Bishop Museum]] in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], hosted an interactive traveling exhibit developed by the [[Franklin Institute]] of [[Philadelphia]], called "What Makes Music?"   Among other things, visitors could examine what makes musical sound by creating waves on an eight-foot-long version of a Slinky toy.&lt;ref name="NYTimes5"&gt;{{cite news |title=Honolulu Exhibit Makes Music |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=1992-08-02 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4D8133FF931A3575BC0A964958260 |accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WeighBridge5500.JPG|thumb|A weighbridge at a gravel pit. The weighbridge is the two part platform over which trucks are driven. The upper works is auxiliary equipment for leveling the load in the truck and is not part of the scale. This scale uses electronic measuring equipment]]

A '''Truck scale''' (US),  '''weighbridge''' (non-US) or '''railroad scale''' is a large set of [[Weighing scale|scale]]s, usually mounted permanently on a concrete foundation, that is used to weigh entire [[Railroad car#Freight cars|rail]] or road [[vehicle]]s and their contents. By weighing the vehicle both empty and when loaded, the load carried by the vehicle can be calculated.

The key component that uses a weighbridge in order to make the weigh measurement is [[load cell]]s.

== Weight certification in the United States ==

Commercial scales have to be National Type Evaluation Program (NTEP) approved or certified. The certification is issued by the [[National Conference on Weights and Measures]] (NCWM), in accordance to the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), "Handbook 44" specifications and tolerances,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncwm.net/content/ntep NTEP]- Retrieved 2011-09-17&lt;/ref&gt; through '''''Conformity Assessment''''' and the '''''Verified Conformity Assessment Program''''' (VCAP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncwm.net/content/conformity-assessment Conformity-assessment]- Retrieved 2011-09-17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal for trade ===

Handbook 44: General Code paragraph G-A.1.; and the NIST Handbook 130 (Uniform Weights and Measures Law; Section 1.13.) define Commercial Weighing and Measuring Equipment as follows;

{{ quote
| weights and measures and       weighing and measuring devices commercially used or employed in establishing the size, quantity, extent, area, or measurement of quantities, things, produce, or articles for distribution or consumption, purchased, offered, or submitted for sale, hire, or award, or in computing any basic charge or payment for services rendered on the basis of weight or measure.
}}

NTEP approved scales are generally considered those scales which are intended by the manufacturer for use in commercial
applications where products are sold by weight. NTEP Approved is also known as ''Legal for Trade'' or complies with Handbook 44.  NTEP scales are commonly used for applications ranging from weighing coldcuts at the deli, to fruit at the roadside farm stand, shipping centers for determining shipping cost to weighing gold and silver and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ntep.balances.com/and/legalfortrade.html|title=Legal for trade scales - NTEP approved balances|last=Shane|first=Gary|website=ntep.balances.com|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Truck scales can be surface mounted with a ramp leading up a short distance and the weighing equipment underneath or they can be pit mounted with the weighing equipment and platform in a pit so that the weighing surface is level with the road.  They are typically built from steel or concrete and by nature are extremely robust.

In earlier versions the bridge is installed over a rectangular pit that contains levers that ultimately connect to a balance mechanism. The most complex portion of this type is the arrangement of levers underneath the weighbridge since the response of the scale must be independent of the distribution of the load.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=popular+science+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=awL8TqCkMcfXgQfW7uTxCQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAzhu#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|title=Popular Science|last=Corporation|first=Bonnier|date=June 1960|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern devices use multiple [[load cell]]s that connect to an electronic equipment to totalize the sensor inputs. In either type of semi-permanent scale the weight readings are typically recorded in a nearby hut or office.

Many weighbridges are now linked to a [[personal computer|PC]] which runs [[truck scale software]] capable of printing tickets and providing reporting features.

== Uses ==

Truck scales can be used for two main purposes:

* Selling or charging by weight over the bridge (Trade Approved)
* Check weighing both axle weights and gross vehicle weights. This helps to stop axle overloading and possible heavy fines.

They are used in industries that manufacture or move bulk items, such as in mines or quarries, garbage dumps / recycling centers, bulk liquid and powder movement, household goods, and electrical equipment.  Since the weight of the vehicle carrying the goods is known (and can be ascertained quickly if it is not known by the simple expedient of weighing the empty vehicle) they are a quick and easy way to measure the flow of bulk goods in and out of different locations.

A single axle truck scale or axle weighing system can be used to check individual axle weights and gross vehicle weights to determine whether the vehicle is safe to travel on the public highway without being stopped and fined by the authorities for being overloaded.  Similar to the full size truck scale these systems can be pit mounted with the weighing surface flush to the level of the roadway or surface mounted.

For many uses (such as at police over the road truck weigh stations or temporary road intercepts) weighbridges have been largely supplanted by simple and thin electronic [[load cell|weigh cells]], over which a vehicle is slowly driven. A computer records the output of the cell and accumulates the total vehicle weight. By weighing the force of each axle it can be assured that the vehicle is within statutory limits, which typically will impose a total vehicle weight, a maximum weight within an axle span limit and an individual axle limit. The former two limits ensure the safety of bridges while the latter protects the road surface.

== Portable versions ==

Portable truck scales can also be found in use around the world. A portable truck scale will have lower frame work that can be placed on non-typical surfaces such as dirt. These scales retain the same level of accuracy as a pit-type scale, with accuracy of up to + or - 1%. The first portable truck scale record in the US was units operated by the ''Weight Patrol'' of the Los Angeles Motor Patrol in 1929.  Four such weighing units were used with one under each of the trucks wheels.  Each unit could record up to {{convert|15,000|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FSgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=popular+science+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VGmeTrjzHMfhsQLNr5H1CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=popular%20science%201930&amp;f=true "Portable Scales Detect Overweight Trucks."] ''Popular Science Monthly'', November 1929, p. 62, bottom of page.&lt;/ref&gt;
