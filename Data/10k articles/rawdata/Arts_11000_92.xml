'''''9 Nelalu''''' or '''''Tommidi Nelalu''''' (English: ''9 Months'') is a 2001 [[Telugu language]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Kranthi Kumar]]. The film features [[Vikram (actor)|Vikram]] And [[Soundarya]] Are in the lead roles. The film opened in 2001 to positive reviews from critics. The film was later re-shot and released in Tamil as ''Kanden Seethaiyai''.&lt;ref&gt;https://groups.yahoo.com/group/arrahmanfans/message/5339?var=1&lt;/ref&gt; The film was premiered retrospective at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. The director shot the film in 15 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindu.com/fr/2005/03/04/stories/2005030401210200.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film revolves around Savitri ([[Soundarya]]), an innocent simple and loving orphan, and Surendra ([[Vikram (actor)|Vikram]]), an intelligent computer programmer. When Savitri has a marriage arranged with a drunkard, Surendra stops this alliance and graciously agreed to marry her.

However, trouble starts when Surendra's brainchild, a virtual reality program on temples of South India is sabotaged, and he is accused of selling out to a rival company. Disillusioned by the sudden turn of events, he crashes into a truck and sustains a serious head injury that requires a major operation.

Savitri finds herself deserted by all her well-wishers when it comes to financial help, and her husband's life hangs in the balance. A lady doctor suggests that she become pregnant through artificial insemination for a rich man, whose wife is impotent, in exchange for monetary remuneration. Savitri agrees and the rest of the film is based on the social stigma attached to artificial insemination and surrogate motherhood.

==Cast==
* [[Vikram (actor)|Vikram]] as Surendra
* [[Soundarya]] as Savitri

==Production==
[[A. R. Rahman]] was initially signed on to score the film's music, but he later opted out owing to the film's small budget.&lt;ref&gt;http://gopalhome.tripod.com/arrbio.html&lt;/ref&gt; The film was premiered retrospective at the [[Toronto]] Film Festival in Canada. The director shot the film in just 15 days.&lt;ref&gt;https://groups.yahoo.com/group/arrahmanfans/message/5339?var=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The film opened to very positive reviews with a critic noting that "in short, this is cinema at its best" and that "the script is smooth flowing and engrossing" and that "it leaves you with a thought and a sense of pride in Indian cinema. Whether it will go down well with the masses is doubtful as there are no songs, action or cheap comedy, which might be a bitter pill to swallow for most". In regard to performances, the critic notes that Soundarya "excels in her role and that her expressions, body language and dialogue delivery fit her role like a glove" and that "Vikram has given a controlled performance as the troubled, confused, yet loving husband."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fullhyderabad.com/profile/movies/1904/2/9-nelalu-movie-review&lt;/ref&gt; The film was later re-shot and released in Tamil as ''Kanden Seethaiyai'' with a comedy track separately shot with [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] added in.

'''''AIDS photo diary, 1986–1990''''' is an art work that comprises a photo diary that records the decline in health and eventual death of David Tosh, from [[AIDS]] from 1986 to 1990 in [[Sydney]], Australia. The diary – with accompanying photographs taken by John Jenner – was created by Jenner to remember his friend and honour the lives of people living with HIV/AIDS. Some of the images were featured in an article in ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''{{'}}s ''Good Weekend'' magazine, 13 October 1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIDS photo diary, 1986–1990 / photographed and compiled by John Jenner|url=http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemdetailpaged.aspx?itemid=844424|work=SLNSW catalogue|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The work includes photographs by John Jenner from 1986 to 1990, together with a biography in the form of a play written by Jenner.  The diary also includes poems by Willy Barber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Jenner – papers, 1985 – 1993|url=http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=9514|work=SLNSW catalogue|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
This diary was one of a number of artistic responses to [[HIV/AIDS in Australia]] at a time when medications that could prolong and enhance the quality of life of those living with HIV had not been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/articles/0310sendziuk.html |title=Denying the Grim Reaper: Australian Responses to AIDS |author=Sendziuk, Paul |work=Eureka Street |accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David Tosh died on 3 May 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|journal=Sydney Morning Herald 'Good Weekend' magazine|date=13 December 1990|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990 Australia experienced 2381 cases of AIDS as reported by the National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Davies, Peter | author2=Aggleton, Peter | author3=Hart, Graham | title=AIDS : rights, risk, and reason | publication-date=1992 | publisher=Falmer Press | isbn=978-0-7507-0039-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  97% of these cases were male and the survival rate was only 40%.

{{Quote box

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3750">'''Allosemitism''' is a neologism used to encompass both [[philo-Semitic]] and [[anti-Semitic]] attitudes towards Jews as [[Other (philosophy)|other]].

==Origin of term==

The term was coined by Polish [[literary critic]] [[Artur Sandauer]] and popularized by Polish sociologist [[Zygmunt Bauman]]. Sandauer used the term "allosemitism" in his essay ''On Situation of Polish Writer of Jewish Descent In the 20th Century'' published as a book in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Artur Sandauer, O sytuacji pisarza polskiego pochodzenia żydowskiego w XX wieku (Rzecz, którą nie ja powinienem był napisać...) (Warszawa: Czytelnik, 1982, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zygmunt Bauman]] proposed the term in his 1997 essay "Allosemitism: Premodern, Modern, Postmodern",” in which he argued  that "allosemitism" should be used in place of "[[anti-semitism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Zygmunt Bauman, “Allosemitism: Premodern, Modern, Postmodern,” in Modernity, Culture, and “the Jew,” ed. Bryan Cheyette and Laura Marcus (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Bauman's argument is that allosemitism can represent a “radically ambivalent attitude,” that encompassing both [[Philo-Semitism]] and anti-Semitism;&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Valerie. "Dissolving Boundaries: Assimilation and Allosemitism in E. A. Dupont's "Das Alte Gesetz" (1923) and Veit Harlan's "Jud Süss" (1940)." The German Quarterly 78.4 (2005): 496-516.&lt;/ref&gt; allosemitism is a form of [[proteophobia]], fear and horror of things that defy clean-cut categories, not, like antisemitism, of a simple fear of the "[[Other (philosophy)|other]]" ([[heterophobia]]); and that Judeophobia is diverse, and, therefore, not adequately encompassed by the term antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Frojmovic. Review of Kessler, Herbert L.; Nirenberg, David, eds., Judaism and Christian Art: Aesthetic Anxieties from the Catacombs to Colonialism, 
H-Judaic, H-Net Reviews. March, 2013. [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=32937]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ruth Gruber]] describes the neologism as a response to "the idea that, good or bad, Jews are different from the non-Jewish mainstream and thus unable to be dealt with in the same way or measured by the same yardstick."&lt;ref name=GruberOther&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gruber|first1=Ruth|title=Allosemitism (noun)—Jews as the perpetual ‘other’|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/world/article/allosemitism_noun_jews_as_the_perpetual_other_20080807|accessdate=10 August 2016|publisher=Jewish Journal|date=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Gruber, the term was coined by Polish-Jewish literary critic [[Artur Sandauer]].&lt;ref name=GruberOther/&gt;

In her 2010 book ''Modernism, Feminism, and Jewishness'', literary scholar Maren Tova Linnett describes the term as originated by both Sandauer and Bauman.&lt;ref&gt;Briefel, Aviva. "Allosemitic Modernism." NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction 43, no. 2 (2010): 361-63. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40959717.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use== 

Linnett uses the term "to describe the multiple modes of difference that these women authors ascribed to the Jew in order to complicate what she views as the overly simplistic polarities of anti-Semitism and philo-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;Briefel, Aviva. "Allosemitic Modernism." NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction 43, no. 2 (2010): 361-63. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40959717.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Eliezer Ben-Rafael]] employs the concept in his 2014 book ''Confronting Allosemitism in Europe: The Case of Belgian Jews.''

[[Yale University Art Gallery]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven.]]|293x293px]]'''Andean textiles''' represent a continuing textile tradition spanning from the [[Pre-Columbian era]] to the Colonial era and present day. Textiles have encompassed a variety of functions, including woven textiles for ceremonial clothing, cloth [[armour]], and [[Quipu|record-keeping]]. Cultural emphasis in the textile arts is often based on the spiritual and metaphysical qualities of the origins of material, as well as cosmological and symbolic messages carried by its visual appearance.

Arid desert conditions along the coast of [[Peru]] have preserved dyed textiles dating as old as 6000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/blue-jeans-6000-year-old-peruvian-ancestor|title=Blue jeans have a 6,000 year-old Peruvian ancestor|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most surviving samples of woven textiles exist as funerary bundles. The textile arts were also instrumental in military and utilitarian use, both as armor and as diplomatic tools and exchanged during interpolitical negotiations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Textiles are also used as a medium of communication, indicating a person's social status and regional affiliation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Traditionally, [[Thread (yarn)|thread]] used for textiles was spun from indigenous [[cotton]] plants, as well as [[alpaca]] and [[llama]] wool. Synthetic threads have since replaced most animal fibers in modern textile arts.

==Origins==

=== Lithic Period ===
The earliest known surviving textiles are samples of fiberwork found in [[Guitarrero Cave]], Peru dating back to 8000 BCE.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49833926|title=Art of the Andes : from Chavín to Inca|last=1958-|first=Stone, Rebecca,|date=2002|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=9780500203637|edition=2nd |location=London|oclc=49833926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early fiberwork by the [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]] civilization consisted of plant fibers that were intertwined and knotted to form baskets and other containers. Surviving examples of finely spun thread and simple cloths indicate that knowledge of spinning and weaving had already been well-established and developed in the area.

[[Mummy|Mummified]] human skeletons dating to this period were stuffed with plant fibers and wrapped in rope and cane, a preservation method invented in the Chilean Chinchoros area around 5000 BC.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36461413|title=Art of the Andes : from Chavín to Inca|last=1958-|first=Stone, Rebecca,|date=1996|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|others=Jay I. Kislak Reference Collection (Library of Congress)|isbn=0500202869|location=New York|oclc=36461413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existence of this technology demonstrates early knowledge of spinning naturally occurring fibers into cord.

=== Pre-Ceramic Era ===
Coastal civilizations were the first to create fishnets, and were the first to utilize the [[openwork]] tradition in knotted objects. The fishnets were created through twining, a non-loom technique similar to [[macramé]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Knotting patterns depicting standing humans, parrots, snakes, and cats have been decoded from surviving fragments.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Initial Period ===
The introduction of [[camelid]] herding for their meat, fibrous hair, and ability to transport cargo was developed in response to remarkably inhospitable environmental conditions found in Andean highlands. As a result, [[alpaca]]s and [[llama]]s were revered for their hardiness and ability to provide resources in both life and death.&lt;ref name="Art Institute of Chicago"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26095624|title=The Ancient Americas : art from sacred landscapes|date=1992|publisher=Art Institute of Chicago|others=Townsend, Richard F.,, Aveni, Anthony F.,, Art Institute of Chicago,, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston,, Los Angeles County Museum of Art,|isbn=3791311883|location=Chicago|oclc=26095624}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scaly fibers produced by these animals were both flexible and dye-permeable, allowing them to be woven with cotton to produce sturdy threads and textiles.[[File:Wari cap.jpg|thumb|[https://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/60488 Wari wool-pile cap], 700-900 C.E., [[Yale University Art Gallery]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven.]]]][[Chavín culture]] began to emerge around the late Initial Period (c. 900-500 BC). Surviving textiles found from looted burials feature brown dye painted on large, seamed panels of cloth. Textiles from the burials of Karwa are featured as ritual cult center objects, and depict explicitly feminine deities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Chavín culture may have demonstrated the first extensive production of textiles for ritualistic and symbolic purposes.

[[Paracas culture]] rapidly developed the textile industry into a time-intensive and labor-consuming practice. Embroidered and woven textiles became commonplace, featuring consistent repetition and variation of motifs. Nonwoven fabric structures, such as headbands, were created through cross-knit looping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interweave.com/article/needlework/nasca-cross-knit-looping/|title=Nasca Cross-Knit Looping - Interweave|date=2018-02-14|work=Interweave|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paracas officials adopted the practice of wearing multiple garments in sets, including headbands, turbans, mantles, ponchos, tunics, skirts, and loincloths.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[Wari culture|Wari]] fiber arts featured large-scale textiles created in state-sponsored workshops. Political messages of abundance and control were depicted using chaotic geometric imagery and camelid-like figures.&lt;ref name="Art Institute of Chicago"/&gt; Examples of surviving imagery (see image) feature multiple repeating motifs of highly geometric patterns, punctuated with highly expressive color palettes. Scholars have argued that the complexity of such designs broadcast the abilities and abundances of state-controlled resources.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Manufacturing technique ===
Many textiles, such as baskets and fishing nets, did not require the use of a loom. The Andeans used the [[back strap loom]] to create woven textiles, as chronicled in [[El primer nueva corónica y buen gobierno]]. Several techniques were used to produce fabric, including [[plain weave]], tapestry weave, and scroll weave. Smaller woven pieces produced on the same loom were often stitched together to create a larger fabric. Borders of embroidered tunics and mantles are often decorated with yarn [[tassel]]s or fringe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artgallery.yale.edu/press-release/weaving-and-social-world-3000-years-ancient-andean-textiles|title=Weaving and the Social World: 3,000 Years of Ancient Andean Textiles|website=artgallery.yale.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prehistoric Andean weavers pioneered new weaving techniques, such as the triple weave and quadruple weave. The use of fine yarn and consistency in stitch size is remarkable, with analyses counting an average of 250 wefts per inch on average, and some samples exceeding 500 wefts per inch. This is attributed to the regularity in diameter and consistency of thread, as well as maintenance of tension on the loom throughout the entire weaving process.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technologies of Power: The Andean Case|last=Lechtman|first=Heather|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1993|isbn=1461490170|location=|pages=244–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A combination of [[cotton]] and [[dye]]d camelid threads contribute structural strength and colorful visual imagery to textiles. The scaly hair of camelids is permeable to dye, allowing natural plant-based dyes to be fixed to camelid fibers in the presence of a natural [[mordant]], such as urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heckman|first=Andrea M.|date=2006|title=Colorful Messages: The Revival of Natural Dyes in Traditional Cuzco Textiles|url=|journal=Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex combinations of coloration and patterning were used to repeat geometric patterns while maintaining visual consistency; [[Paracas culture|Paracas]] textiles are especially well known for their regular gridlike arrangement of [[Inca mythology|iconographic]] images. The consistency of scale and shape of these patterns point to the use of counting systems used by textile artisans to record the number of stitches and distance between each geometric pattern.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/31780747|title=To weave for the sun : ancient Andean textiles in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|last=1958-|first=Stone, Rebecca,|date=1994|publisher=Thames and Hudson|others=Paul, Anne., Niles, Susan A., Young-Sánchez, Margaret., Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.|isbn=0500277931|location=London|oclc=31780747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workshop production ===

Several different methods of embroidery are attributed to distinctive styles of coloring and depiction of images in woven textiles. Block color, linear, and broad line styles of embroidery imparted different visual effects upon the woven textile, and were used to convey different types of information.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Designs were also painted directly onto woven textiles using various dyes (see figure).

Professional textile artisans in pre-Incan cultures often worked in large workshops with artisans in several specialties. Proximity to other artisans allowed for additional features to be incorporated into plain weave textiles, including [[metal]]lic threads, knotted strings of [[feather]]s, and [[Brocade|brocading]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Textile painting was common practice in the preparation of special cloths for [[Funeral|funerary bundles]] of high-ranking members of society. Pigments such as [[ochre]] and [[cinnabar]] have been used for painting textiles since the [[Early Horizon|Early Horizon period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnard|first=Hans|date=2016|title=Painted textiles: knowledge and technowledge in the Andes|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00776297.2016.1239831|journal=Nawpa Pacha|volume=36|pages=209–228|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Tupu pin.jpg|thumb|245x245px|[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/309227?sortBy=Relevance&amp;ft=tupu&amp;offset=0&amp;rpp=20&amp;pos=2 Tupu pin], 1400-1533 AD, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City|New York]].|left]]

=== Social significance ===
Intricately woven [[mantle (clothing)|mantle]]s were created to be worn by nobles and elites, both in life and death. Mantles were often extensive and large, averaging 275 [[centimeters]] in length and 130 centimeters in width, and were draped around the neck and over the shoulders.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Women fastened fabrics at the front of the body with a ''tupu'', or shawl pin. The size of the mantle and [[Perspective (graphical)|foreshortening]] effects of imagery contributed to the appearance of the wearer as being "larger than life," serving as explicit status symbols.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Bright dyes served to distinguish social elite from those of lesser status, as undyed fabric worn by commoners was brown. [[Chinchero District|Chinchero]] officers wore red ponchos to signify rank during formal government occasions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; [[Inca Empire|Inca]] rulers wore a ''llautu'', or tasseled red fringe, on their forehead to demonstrate their status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/315492|title=Male Figurine {{!}} Inca {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gifts were also given to conquered territories in ceremonial shows of dominance over the peoples of the region. A region's ability to produce textiles was intricately connected to its success of camelid herding, indicating the value of state-controlled wealth in a territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/index.php/about-andean-textiles/|title=About Andean Textiles – Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|website=www.textilescusco.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Burial bundles ===
Woven garments worn during life indicated an individual's social rank, and were often interred with the individual in death. Gift textiles created expressly for funerary purposes were also interred, without being worn in life. Ritual gift objects wrapped in "mummy bundles" include obsidian knives, combs, and balls of thread.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[Paracas culture]] practiced mummification by wrapping the deceased in several layers of woven textiles. Over 429 [[funeral bundle]]s containing gift textiles, reams of plain cloth, and various ritual paraphernalia have been excavated from a necropolis at [[Paracas National Reserve#Protected status|Cerro Colorado]]. These artifacts offer the largest source of pre-Columbian Andean textile arts known to date.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/20724087|title=Paracas ritual attire : symbols of authority in ancient Peru|last=Anne.|first=Paul,|date=1990|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0806122307|location=Norman|oclc=20724087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military use==
While Andean civilizations had knowledge of and were capable of working metal, quilted armor was preferred for its light weight and flexibility. Soldiers depicted by [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala]] wear cloth tunics and wind strips of fabric around themselves to create a sturdy armor that allowed for movement while providing defense. The use of cloth rather than metallic armor was also motivated by cultural reasons. The properties of cloth were believed to transfer spiritual reinforcement and power to its wearer, supplying strength and force.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For similar reasons, woven [[Sling (weapon)|slings]] made of plant fibers were the preferred weapons of [[Moche culture|Moche]] civilization, rather than stiff wooden or metallic implements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cloth blankets and tent-making equipment were readily transportable, allowing caches of resources to be delivered to battle frontiers. Storage warehouses containing cloth equipment have been excavated throughout [[Tawantin Suyu]]. Defeated armies forced to retreat often burned all cloth unable to be carried, preventing enemy forces from capturing these valuable stashes.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murra|first=John V.|date=August 1962|title=Cloth and Its Functions in the Inca State|jstor=667788|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=64|pages=710–728|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colonial Period ==
[[File:Colonial period womens mantle.jpg|thumb|[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/316892 Woman's mantle], 1600-1700 C.E., [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City|New York.]]]]
The [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]] resulted in the immigration of Spanish settlers to on the Andean coast. Middle- and upper-class Spanish families recognized the value of finely woven native textiles, and demanded luxury textiles to decorate their own homes. As a result, ''cumbi'', a fine tapestry cloth woven from alpaca fibers, was modified to a Spanish color palette and produced for the homes and churches of settlers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dressworld.hypotheses.org/363|title="T" is for Cumbi Tapestries: Peruvian Textiles in the Spanish Colonial Home. Julia McHugh, Douglass Foundation Fellow in American Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York|work=DRESSING THE NEW WORLD|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''tornasol'' refers to the style of textile absorbed by Andean weavers after the European context, characterized by a silky texture that appears to change color from different perspectives.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phipps|first=Elena|date=2000|title='Tornesol': a Colonial synthesis of European and Andean textile traditions|url=|journal=Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native weavers modified their technique to produce common items for their colonial audience. Bedcovers, table covers, rugs, and wall hangings became popular textile formats in the late 18th century. European influences introduced lace-inspired borders and stylized circular patterns.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

While garments had traditionally been brightly colored and highly patterned, the garments worn by highland Andeans during the Colonial period were characteristically plain and black. This has been interpreted as an act of mourning for the lost Inca empire, but may also be a result of cultural influence imported by arriving Spanish colonists.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{clear}}

==History==
[[File:Channarong3.png|thumb|150px|Channarong Pornrungroj]]
In 1997, [[Channarong Pornrungroj]], the former Dean of the Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts at Chulalongkorn University started an [[art]] program for disadvantaged and disabled children. “Art for All” uses art as a vehicle for developing the skills and talents of both disabled and non-disabled individuals. In 2007, the Art for All Foundation partnered with the Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts of Thailand's largest [[university]], Chulalongkorn University, creating a campus office known as the Art for All Center. Chulalongkorn University prematurely pulled funding for the Art for All Center's 3-year contract due to accounting and reporting irregularities. The University is no longer associated with Art for All. 

Program [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s, in conjunction with gifted and average children along with the blind, deaf and physically or mentally impaired all take part in a diverse range of activities. They range from musical, visual and mixed media, [[dance]], [[drama]] to [[literature]] experiences. It is through these activities that they learn about cooperative teamwork, [[life skills]], the creative process and themselves.

==Activities==
The Art for All program offers and conducts a diverse array of activities where both mainstream and disadvantaged young people learn to work cooperatively together. They range from weekend [[art education]] exchange sessions to the larger annual, regional and indigenous Hilltribe Art for All Camps as well as one for prisoners facing [[Life sentence|life]] and [[death sentence]]s.

Art for All also organizes art exhibitions, workshops, hosts the international art education model group as well as conducts research and publishing an annual that incorporates leading [[Academic paper|research papers]] related to art, education and the underprivileged. The Art for All program’s dedicated staff brings at least 20 activities per year to the people of Thailand and the world community since its inception in 1997.

==International Education Model and Research Forum==
The Art for All international program brings together key researchers and program representatives to present their current papers in an exchange forum about the disabled art education programs in their own country.

* Art for All Thailand is proud to acknowledge the development of an "Art for All 2" in [[Malaysia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ytlcommunity.com/commnews/shownews.asp?newsid=5337 Malaysia's Art for All 2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728033434/http://www.ytlcommunity.com/commnews/shownews.asp?newsid=5337 |date=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that was the direct result of their representatives participating in Thailand's original Art for All program. Malaysia's Art for All 2 commenced in October 2001.
* The [[United Nations]] in 2002 selected the Art for All program to be exhibited in [[Australia]] and [[Japan]].
* Thailand's 2007 international model Art for All program focused on its [[ASEAN]] neighbors and had 40 representatives from [[Bhutan]], [[Brunei]], [[Cambodia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Lao People's Democratic Republic|Lao PDR]], [[Malaysia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Philippines]], [[South Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] participate.

[[File:Katy Perry - Super Bowl XLIX Halftime 02.jpg|thumb|[[Katy Perry]] performing with the dancing sharks backup dancers during the performance of "[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry song)|Teenage Dream]]" at the [[Super Bowl XLIX halftime show]]]]

On 25 February 2015, a backup dancer performing with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] at the Brit Awards accidentally pulled Madonna backwards down a small flight of stairs when performing an act that involved pulling a cape off of Madonna's neck.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web | author=Almasy, Steve | title=Madonna falls at Brit Awards; Twitter's got jokes | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=25 February 2015 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/25/entertainment/madonna-fall-brit-awards/ | accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna quickly recovered and continued with the show, and later attributed the accident to the cape being tied too tightly.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

At the [[Super Bowl XLIX halftime show]] on 1 February 2015, backup dancers dressed in shark costumes accompanied [[Katy Perry]] as she performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Malec | first=Brett | title=See the Sexy Backup Dancer Who Was Katy Perry's Super Bowl Shark | website=[[E!]] | date=2 February 2015 | url=http://www.eonline.com/news/620827/katy-perry-s-dancing-shark-revealed-meet-the-singer-s-sexy-super-bowl-backup-dancer | accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laxdæla saga - Kjartan died on the lap of Bolli.jpg|right|thumb|Kjartan Ólafsson slain by Bolli. Bolli, filled with regret, holds the dying Kjartan in his arms.]]
'''Bolli Þorleiksson''' (also '''Bolli Thorleiksson''') was a key historical character in the [[Old Norse|Medieval Icelandic]] [[Laxdœla saga]], which recounts the history of the [[Norse clans|People of Laxárdalur]]. He courted the famed [[Guðrún Ósvífursdóttir]], but Guðrún preferred his foster-brother Kjartan Ólafsson. Guðrún gave herself to Bolli, because of a false rumour that Kjartan was engaged to Ingibjörg, the sister of King [[Óláfr Tryggvason|Ólafur Tryggvason]]. Bolli engaged in hostilities with his foster-brother, which ended with him killing Kjartan, and then being killed in turn by Kjartan's kinsmen at the dairy.

==Death and aftermath==
Bolli was well known for his skill and his sword "Footbiter". Prior to the attack, Thorstein the Black said "however underhanded he may be where he is, you may make up your mind for a brisk defence on his part, strong and skilled at arms as he is. He also has a sword that for a weapon is a trusty one."&lt;ref name="LV"&gt;[http://omacl.org/Laxdaela/chapter55.html Chapter LV]&lt;/ref&gt; Bolli dealt one of his attackers a blow with Footbiter, which clove him through the head to the shoulder, killing him.

{{quote|Then Lambi went in; he held his shield before him, and a drawn sword in his hand. In the nick of time Bolli pulled Footbiter out of the wound, whereat his shield veered aside so as to lay him open to attack. So Lambi made a thrust at him in the thigh, and a great wound that was. Bolli hewed in return, and struck Lambi's shoulder, and the sword flew down along the side of him, and he was rendered forthwith unfit to fight, and never after that time for the rest of his life was his arm any more use to him. At this brunt Helgi, the son of Hardbein, rushed in with a spear, the head of which was an ell long, and the shaft bound with iron. When Bolli saw that he cast away his sword, and took his shield in both hands, and went towards the dairy door to meet Helgi. Helgi thrust at Bolli with the spear right through the shield and through him. Now Bolli leaned up against the dairy wall, and the men rushed into the dairy, Halldor and his brothers, to wit, and Thorgerd went into the dairy as well.

Bolli stood still against the dairy wall, and held tight to him his kirtle lest his inside should come out. Then Steinthor Olafson leapt at Bolli, and hewed at his neck with a large axe just above his shoulders, and forthwith his head flew off.|&lt;ref name="LV"/&gt;}}

His second son, [[Bolli Bollasson]], was born the winter after his killing, and his first son Thorleik was only four at the time. They grew up in Holyfell, after his mother Guðrún exchanged homes with the renowned [[Snorri Goði|Snorri the Goði]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://omacl.org/Laxdaela/chapter56.html Chapter LVI]&lt;/ref&gt; Guðrún constantly argued for revenge for his killing, but eventually his two sons made peace with the sons of Ólaf, Kjartan's kinsmen, at the [[Thing (assembly)|Thorness Thing]]; it is not known how much money was exchanged in [[Weregild|compensation]] as part of the agreement, but "both sides were thought to have gained in esteem from these affairs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://omacl.org/Laxdaela/chapter71.html Chapter LXXI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many times the reference, in Jewish sources, is to that which enlightens spiritually.

==Mystical interpretations in Judaism==
It has also been described as an "orgasm in the process of the divine".&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=qloL-PJdtzYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=%22buzina%22+aramaic&amp;ots=OkbdpQxL9P&amp;sig=P-N5ETljMb2Mbx73RfQkYFePaBE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22buzina%22%20&amp;f=false |title=Reading the Zohar: the sacred text of the Kabbalah |author=Pinchas Giller |publisher= Oxford University Press|date= 2001|accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinchas Giller, in ''Reading the Zohar: the sacred text of the Kabbalah'' (Oxford University Press, 2001), devotes a section to the phrase, calling it "the boldest image of the ''Hormanuta'' literature".&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;  John Tindall Harris and William Robert Brown wrote in ''The writings of the Apostle John: with notes, critical and expository'' (1889) that "our lord used words that could not fail to be understood by the people, for among the Jews any one distinguished for light and erudition was termed in Aramaic ... ''bostina, a lamp or torch'' (Ber. Rab. 95.4).  Chrystosom observes, He called John a torch or lamp, signifying that he had not light of himself but by the grace of the Spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=vQIVAAAAYAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA448&amp;dq=%22Botsina%22+aramaic&amp;ots=FiB1KffJ59&amp;sig=ka1FH7ZrUzXPcK4c2nM3HTcT_94#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Botsina%22%20&amp;f=false |title=The writings of the Apostle John: with notes, critical and expository |author=John Tindall Harris, William Robert Brown |publisher= Hodder and Stoughton |date=1889 |accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Yehuda Liebes]], in ''Studies in Jewish myth and Jewish messianism'' (SUNY Press, 1993), wrote that "ambiguities of meaning are typical in the [[Zohar]], and the word ''bostina'' (spark) illustrates this well".&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

==As a descriptive term for Torah sages==
Many{{Who|date=June 2009}} people have been referred to as Botsina Kadisha ("[The] Holy Lantern") but foremost Rabbi [[Shimon Bar Yochai]], the author of the Zohar (the prime of Jewish esoteric works) is referred to as Botsina Kadisha.

The [[Arizal]], Rabbi [[Itzhak Luria]], the most famous Kabbalist of modern times is referred to as Botsina Kadisha in the books of his disciple Rabbi Chaim Vital. He lived about 500 years ago in Tzfat, Israel.

The alter Rebbe of the Chabad movement is referred to as Botsina Kadisha as is seen in the opening of his book Likutei Torah. He lived a few hundred years ago and he is the author of the famous Chabad book called The Tanya or Sefer Beinonim.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2811">In theater and music history, a '''burletta''' ([[Italian language|Italian]], meaning "little joke", sometimes '''burla''' or '''burlettina''') is a brief comic [[opera]]. In eighteenth-century Italy, a burletta was the comic [[intermezzo]] between the acts of an ''[[opera seria]]''. The extended work [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi|Pergolesi]]'s ''[[La serva padrona]]'' was also designated a "burletta" at its [[London]] premiere in 1750. 

In England, the term began to be used, in contrast to [[burlesque]], for works that satirized opera but did not employ musical parody. Burlettas in [[English language|English]] began to appear in the 1760s, the earliest identified as such being ''[[Midas (burletta)|Midas]]'' by [[Kane O'Hara]], first performed privately in 1760 near [[Belfast]], and produced at [[Covent Garden Theatre|Covent Garden]] in 1764. The form became debased when the term ''burletta'' began to be used for English comic or [[ballad opera]]s, as a way of evading the [[monopoly]] on "legitimate drama"&lt;ref&gt;Meaning spoken plays, rather than opera, dance, concerts, or plays with music ({{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1229543 |title=Definition from the Everything 2 website |publisher=Everything2.com |date=6 January 2002 |accessdate=20 March 2010}})&lt;/ref&gt; in London belonging to Covent Garden and [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]]. After the passage of the [[Theatres Act 1843|Theatres Act of 1843]], which repealed crucial regulations of the [[Licensing Act 1737|Licensing Act of 1737]], use of the term declined.

== List of Theatrical Burlettas ==
* ''[[Midas (burletta)|Midas]]'' by [[Kane O'Hara]] (Belfast, 1760, Dublin, 1762)
* ''Orpheus'' by [[François-Hippolyte Barthélémon]] (London, 1767)
* ''The Judgement of Paris'' by Barthélémon (London, 1768)
* ''[[The Recruiting Serjeant]]'' by [[Charles Dibdin]] (London, 1770)
* ''The Portrait'' by [[Samuel Arnold (composer) |Samuel Arnold]] (1770)
* ''The Portrait'' by Barthélémon (Dublin, c. 1771)
* ''The Golden Pippin'' by John Abraham Fisher (1773)
* ''Poor Vulcan'' by Dibdin (1778)

== Other Meanings ==
The word ''burletta'' has also been used for [[scherzo]]-like instrumental music by composers including [[Max Reger]] and [[Bartók]]. In America, the word has sometimes been used as an alternative for [[burlesque]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6959">'''Carolyn Korsmeyer''' (born 1950) is an author and Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Buffalo]] in New York. She is generally recognized for her study and research on [[aesthetics]], [[feminism]], and [[emotion theory]].&lt;ref name="Dept of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carolyn Korsmeyer|url=http://www.philosophy.buffalo.edu/people/faculty/korsmeyer/|accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Carolyn received her Ph.D. from [[Brown University]] in 1972. In 1978, she began working as a professor of [[Philosophy]] at the University of Buffalo where she continues to work today as the Head of the Philosophy Department.&lt;ref name="University Archives"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carolyn Korsmeyer|url=http://library.buffalo.edu/archives/womens_work/bios/korsmeyer.htm|work=2012|publisher=University of Buffalo|accessdate=21 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305010343/http://library.buffalo.edu/archives/womens_work/bios/korsmeyer.htm#|archive-date=2014-03-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since beginning her career at the University of Buffalo, Korsmeyer has been recognized multiple times for her outstanding performance and continued achievements for her work both in and away from Philosophy.&lt;ref name="University Archives"/&gt; During her long career, Korsmeyer has published multiple acclaimed articles and books on feminism and aesthetics.&lt;ref name="University Archives"/&gt;

== Overview of major work ==
After receiving her PhD in 1972, Korsmeyer began to focus her research on feminist philosophy and the field of aesthetics. Feminist perspectives in aesthetics has long been major work of Korsmeyer.&lt;ref name="University Archives"/&gt;  Fine art, genius, beauty, taste, and  aesthetic perception are gendered issues that she has studied and researched.&lt;ref name="essay review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Koopman|first=Constantijn|title=Essay review of Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction|url=http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Koopman5_1.pdf|publisher=Action, Criticism, and Theory for Music Education|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophy of taste ===
The [[philosophy of taste]] is a relatively new subject in the field of philosophy, however Korsmeyer's study of "bad taste" is well known.&lt;ref name="Dept of Philosophy"/&gt; Her consideration of taste in philosophy explores why pungent food like soured milk, fried bugs, extremely hot peppers, and game meat are seen as strong and complex to our palettes.&lt;ref name="Korsmeyer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Korsmeyer|first=Carolyn|title=Making Sense of Food and Taste: Food and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=20ltkqE2s1UC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP13&amp;dq=Carolyn+Korsmeyer&amp;ots=m8VqoRzxQR&amp;sig=jcuJ1Zd9LaQBy02TxjJrJm90Agc#v=onepage&amp;q=Carolyn%20Korsmeyer&amp;f=false|publisher=Cornell University Press|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical understanding of taste of food is compared to the philosophy and interpretation of art in that both deem the similar qualities that entail discriminating perception and also that food and art are both considered 'artistic in creation.' &lt;ref name="Korsmeyer"/&gt;  The argument Korsmeyer presents is that these "cosmopolitan foods" are so complex that they lie on a nearly transparent line straddling between the sublime and disgusting and, when the brain is given the choice, usually the positive reaction wins. Thus, these seemingly disgusting foods give a positive aesthetic response.&lt;ref name="essay review"/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Her publications on the subject include:&lt;ref name="acsu.buffalo.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~ckors/|title=Carolyn Korsmeyer|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Making Sense of Taste: Food and Philosophy'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1999)

=== Feminist perspectives in aesthetics ===
[[Feminist aesthetics]] refers to the idea that in their basic form, classic concepts such as genius, beauty, fine art, aesthetic perception cradle social roles are qualities that are presumed as gender related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Korsmeyer|first=Carolyn|title=Feminist Aesthetics|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=feminism-aesthetics|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition)|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her most notorious book titled ''Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction to Understanding Feminist Philosophy'' (London: Routledge, 2004) Korsmeyer uses these "classic concepts" to identify their qualities and goes on to explain the weight of gender as the abiding attribute. Genius, for example, is said to be 'superior in mind' which has long been associated with [[masculinity]] while '[[beauty]]' has long been described as small, soft curvatures that "catch a man's eye" and thus, is defined as female.&lt;ref name="essay review"/&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Much of her work revolves around the parameters of feminist presence in art, music, and literature.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|last=Korsmeyer|first=Carolyn|title=Aesthetics in Feminist Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=s6GSMUGGEmgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=Carolyn+Korsmeyer&amp;ots=PuYT_sCHvT&amp;sig=MkrfyPnLMAJZFB6YSDop1CGKx00#v=onepage&amp;q=Carolyn%20Korsmeyer&amp;f=false|publisher=Hypatia, Inc|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In her book ''Aesthetics in Feminist Perspective'' Korsemeyer compares theories of art and the varying interpretations based on gender bias.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

== Honors and achievements ==
University at Buffalo Research Recognition Program awarded Korsmeyer their Sustained Achievement Exceptional Scholar Award to awknowledge her outstanding performance over a several year period in her body of work.&lt;ref name="University Archives"/&gt; In 2001, she won the Buffalo and Erie County Public Library's Mark Twain Creative Writing Competition by writing a chapter that concluded Twain's unpublished short story, ''A Murder, a Mystery and a Marriage.''&lt;ref name="University Archives"/&gt;

'''Charles-Amable Lenoir''' (22 October 1860 – 1926) was a [[French people|French]] [[Painting|painter]]. Like his mentor, [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], he was an [[academic painter]] and painted [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] portraits as well as mythological and religious scenes. His artistic career was so prestigious that he won the [[Prix de Rome]] twice and was awarded the ''[[Légion d'honneur]]''.&lt;ref name="rehs" /&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Lenoir, Charles-Amable - La Baigneuse.jpg|thumbnail|left| La Baigneuse]]
Lenoir was born in Châtellaillon, a small town just outside [[La Rochelle]]. His mother was a seamstress and his father was a customs officer. When he was young, his father was reassigned and the family moved to [[Fouras]]. He did not start out in life as an artist, but instead began his education at a teachers' college in La Rochelle. Upon graduation, he worked as a teacher and supervisor at the ''[[lycée]]'' in Rochefort.&lt;ref name="rehs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arc" /&gt;

In August 1883 he was accepted into the [[École des Beaux-Arts de Paris]]. He also joined the [[Académie Julian]] where he was a student of William-Adolphe Bouguereau and [[Tony Robert-Fleury]]. Lenoir made his artistic debut at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in 1887 and continued to exhibit there until his death. He was quickly noticed in the art world, and in 1889 won the Second Prix de Rome for his painting, ''Jésus et le paralytique'' (''Jesus and a Sick Man with Palsy''), and he won the First Prix de Rome the following year for ''Le Reniement de Saint Pierre'' (''The Denial of St. Peter'').&lt;ref name="rehs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arc" /&gt;

His awards did not stop with the Prix de Rome; works shown at the Salons also won prizes, and he received a third-class medal in 1892 for ''Le Grenier a Vingt Ans'' (''The Garret at twenty years'') and a second-class medal in 1896 for ''La Mort de Sappho'' (''The Death of Sappho'').&lt;ref name="Appleton-1894" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Appleton-1897" /&gt; In 1900, he won a bronze medal at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|world's fair]] in Paris for ''Le Calme'' (''The Calm''), a painting of his new wife, Eugénie Lucchesi.&lt;ref name="rehs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="interencheres" /&gt;

In tribute to his lasting appeal, Lenoir was appointed a Chevalier de la [[Légion d'honneur]] in 1903. He kept a house in Fouras and returned every summer.

The '''arms of the [[University of Cambridge]]''' in [[Cambridge]], England, are [[blazon|blazoned]]: ''[[Gules]], on a [[cross (heraldry)|cross]] [[ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] between four [[lion (heraldry)|lions]] passant guardant [[or (heraldry)|Or]], a [[Bible]] lying fesseways of the field, clasped and garnished of the third, the clasps in base.''
Or in layman's terms: 

{{cquote|On a red background, a cross of ermine fur between four gold lions walking but with one fore-leg raised, and facing the observer. These lions must always face the left-hand edge of the page or item on which the arms are displayed (which means they are facing right, heraldically speaking). On the centre of the cross is a closed book with its spine horizontal and with clasps and decoration, the clasps pointing downward.|author=University of Cambridge Communications Team}}

The arms were granted at the 1573 [[heraldic visitation|visitation]] of the [[County of Cambridge]] undertaken by [[Robert Cooke (officer of arms)|Robert Cooke]], the then [[Clarenceux King of Arms]], and a graduate of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]]. The lions represent the university's royal patronage, the ermine represents dignity, and the Bible on the cross represents both knowledge and the Christian faith.

The motto is not a fixed or necessary component of the arms, but the motto generally used by the University is ''Hinc lucem et pocula sacra'', Latin for "From here, light and sacred draughts". This derives from an emblem traditionally used by the [[Cambridge University Press|University Press]], featuring the ''alma mater'' ("nourishing mother") of Cambridge with a sun in one hand, representing enlightenment, and in the other a cup collecting droplets from the sky, representing spiritual sustenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bedders, Bulldogs and Bedells: a Cambridge Glossary|publisher=the University Press|location=Cambridge|last=Stubbings|first=Frank|date=1995|page=39|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2udnDNt_iIoC&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cărturești Carusel is a bookstore on [[Lipscani]] 55 Street in the old town of [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]].

The building that currently houses the bookstore was built at the beginning of the 20th century by the Chrissoveloni bankers family. During the first few decades of its existence the building housed the Chrissoveloni Bank headquarters, and afterwards it became a general store. At the end of the 1990s and early 2000s the building fell into decay, up until 2015 when a 5 year long rehabilitation, strengthening and conversion project was complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wall-street.ro/special/cladiri-emblema-ale-romaniei/179664/povestea-carturesti-carusel-mega-libraria-de-800-000-euro-din-lipscani-fotografii-din-seara-dinaintea-deschiderii.html|title=Cărturești Carusel în avanpremieră: o librărie spectacol, amenajată cu 400.000 euro (FOTO)|date=11 February 2015|website=Wall-Street.ro|publisher=|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|destiny}}{{Wiktionary|fate}}
'''Destiny''', sometimes referred to as '''fate''' (from [[Latin]] ''fatum'' – destiny), is a predetermined course of events. &lt;ref name=Raphals&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lisa Raphals|authorlink1=|title=Philosophy East and West|date=4 October 2003|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|pages=537–574|edition=Volume 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare ''[[determinism]]'', the [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[proposition]] that every event, including human cognition and behavior, is [[causality|causally]] determined by an unbroken [[chain of prior occurrences]].&lt;/ref&gt; It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual.

==Fate==
[[File:Alphonse Mucha - Fate.jpg|thumb|''Fate'', by [[Alphonse Mucha]]]]
Although often used interchangeably, the words [[wiktionary:fate|"fate"]] and "destiny" have distinct connotations.

* Traditional usage defines fate as a power or agency that predetermines and orders the course of events. Fate defines events as ordered or "inevitable" and unavoidable. This is a concept based on the belief that there is a fixed [[Natural order (philosophy)|natural order]] to the universe, and in some conceptions, the [[cosmos]]. Classical and European mythology feature personified "fate spinners," known as the [[Moirai]] in Greek mythology,&lt;ref name=Dietrich&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dietrich|first1=B.C.|title=The Spinning of Fate in Homer|date=1962|pages=86–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Parcae]] in Roman mythology, and the [[Norns]] in Norse mythology. They determine the events of the world through the [[Weaving (mythology)|mystic spinning of threads]] that represent individual human fates. Fate is often conceived as being divinely inspired.{{cn|date=September 2015}}
* Destiny is used with regard to the finality of events as they have worked themselves out; and to that same sense of "destination", projected into the future to become the flow of events as they will work themselves out.{{cn|date=September 2015}}
* [[Fatalism]] refers to the belief that events fixed by fate are unchangeable by any type of human agency. In other words, humans can not alter their own fates or the fates of others.&lt;ref name=Raphals /&gt;

==Fortune==
Fortune differs terminologically from destiny and fate in that it has more to do with specific occurrences and outcomes, whereas destiny ultimately revolves around death rather than the events of one’s life. In [[Hellenistic civilization]], the chaotic and unforeseeable turns of [[chance (philosophy)|chance]] gave increasing prominence to a previously less notable goddess, [[Tyche]] (literally "[[Luck]]"), who embodied the good fortune of a city and all whose lives depended on its security and prosperity, two good qualities of life that appeared to be out of human reach. The Roman image of [[Fortuna]], with the wheel she blindly turned, was retained by Christian writers, revived strongly in the Renaissance and survives in some forms today.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Rota Fortunae|The Wheel of Fortune]]" remains an emblem of the chance element in fate(destiny). 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Philosophy on the concepts of destiny and fate has existed since the Hellenistic period with groups such as the [[Stoics]] and the [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]].

The Stoics believed that human decisions and actions ultimately went according to a divine plan devised by a god. They claimed that although humans theoretically have free will, their souls and the circumstances under which they live are all part of the universal network of fate.

The Epicureans challenged the Stoic beliefs by denying the existence of this divine fate. They believed that a human's actions were voluntary so long as they were rational.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Greece and the Hellenic Tradition"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karamanolis|first1=George E.|title=Vol. 1 of Encyclopedia of Greece and the Hellenic Tradition|date=2000|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=610–611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In daily language, "destiny" and "fate" are synonymous, but with regard to [[19th-century philosophy]], the words gained inherently different meanings.

For [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], destiny was just a manifestation of the Will to Live, which can be at the same time living fate and choice of overrunning fate, by means of the [[Art]], of the [[Morality]] and of the [[Asceticism|Ascesis]].

For [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], destiny keeps the form of ''[[Amor fati]]'' (Love of Fate) through the important element of Nietzsche's philosophy, the "[[will to power]]" (der ''Wille zur Macht''), the basis of human behavior, influenced by the Will to Live of Schopenhauer. But this concept may have even other senses, although he, in various places, saw the will to power as a strong element for adaptation or survival in a better way.&lt;ref&gt;Beyond Good &amp; Evil 13, Gay Science 349 &amp; Genealogy of Morality II:12&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche eventually transformed the idea of matter as centers of force into matter as centers of will to power as humanity's destiny to face with ''amor fati''. The expression ''Amor fati'' is used repeatedly by [[Nietzsche]] as acceptation-choice of the ''fate'', but in such way it becomes even another thing, precisely a "choice" destiny.

[[Determinism]] is a philosophical concept often confused with fate, it can be defined as the notion that all intents/actions are ''causally'' determined by the culminations of an agent's existing circumstances; simply put, everything that happens is determined by things that have already happened.&lt;ref name=Nagel&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nagel|first1=Thomas|authorlink1=Thomas Nagel|title=What Does it all Mean?|date=1987|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|chapter=Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determinism differs from fate in that it is never conceived as being a spiritual, religious, nor astrological notion; fate is typically thought of as being "given" or "decreed" while determinism is "caused."  Influential philosophers like [[Robert Kane (philosopher)]], [[Thomas Nagel]], [[Roderick Chisholm]], and [[A.J. Ayer]] have written about this notion.

==Religion==
The idea of a god controlled destiny plays an important role in numerous religions.

* Followers of [[Ancient Greek religion]] regarded not only the [[Moirai]] but also the gods, particularly [[Zeus]], as responsible for deciding and carrying out destiny, respectively. 
* Those who followed [[Gnosticism]] believed in fate as something strict and unchangeable, resulting in salvation only for the “chosen ones.”
* Followers of [[Christianity]] consider God to be the only force with control over one’s fate and that he has a plan for every person. Many believe that humans all have free will, which is contrasted with [[predestination]], although naturally inclined to act according to God’s desire.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Greece and the Hellenic Tradition"/&gt;
* In Islam, fate or ''[[qadar]]'' is the decree of Allah.

==Literature==
Historically and globally, fate has played a large role in several literary works.  In ancient Greece, many legends and tales teach the futility of trying to outmaneuver an inexorable fate that has been correctly predicted. This portrayal of fate is present in works such as ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' (427 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sophocles|editor1=Stephen Berg|editor2=Diskin Clay|title=Oedipus the King|date=1978|origyear=427 BC|publisher=Oxford UP|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Iliad]],'' the ''[[Odyssey]]'' (800 BCE), and ''[[Theogony]].'' Many ancient Chinese works have also portrayed the concept of fate, most notably the ''[[Liezi]],'' ''[[Mencius (book)|Mengzi]],'' and the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]].'' Similarly, and in Italy, the Spanish [[Duque de Rivas]]' play that [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] transformed into ''[[La Forza del Destino]]'' ("The Force of Destiny") includes notions of fate. In England, fate has played a notable literary role in Shakespeare's ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1606), Thomas Hardy's ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' (1891), Samuel Beckett's ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'' (1957), and W.W Jacobs' popular short story "[[The Monkey's Paw]]" (1902). In America, [[Thornton Wilder]]'s book ''[[The Bridge of San Luis Rey]]'' (1927) portrays the conception of fate. In Germany, fate is a recurring theme in the literature of [[Hermann Hesse]] (1877–1962), including ''[[Siddhartha (novel)|Siddharta]]'' (1922) and his magnum opus, ''Das Glasperlenspiel,'' also published as ''[[The Glass Bead Game]]'' (1943). And by Hollywood through such characters as Neo in ''[[The Matrix]]''. The common theme of these works involves a protagonist who cannot escape their  destiny, however hard they try.

'''''Funky Bones''''' is a public artwork by [[Atelier Van Lieshout]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist collective led by [[Joep van Lieshout]], located in the [[100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park]], which is on the grounds of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]].  The artwork, primarily made from [[fiberglass]], consists of twenty white and black [[bone]]-shaped benches.

==Description==
''Funky Bones'' is situated in the Meadow region just south of the lake at 100 Acres.  It is a site-specific artwork consisting of twenty white bone-shaped benches inscribed with black drawings of bones that together form a large stylized human [[skeleton]]. The artwork was constructed primarily from fiberglass, [[plywood]], and [[concrete]]. Each bench is a fiberglass shell filled with a lightweight foam material. The fiberglass surface has been impregnated with pigment, carved, and coated in polyester resin. Plywood was used only during the detailing process of the black bone segments and is not visible in the completed artwork. The concrete component for this artwork is not visible but rather serves as a structural aid, anchoring and securing the individual benches into the ground. A standard [[ready-mix concrete]] was used for this application.

The skeleton is positioned with its arms spread out horizontally while the legs point straight down.  The individual benches range in both length and width, but all are approximately 26'' in height.  The artwork was fabricated in Atelier Van Lieshout's studio in [[Rotterdam]] and shipped to the Indianapolis Museum of Art where it was installed by the design and installation crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funky Bones|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/100acres/artists/ateliervanlieshout|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical information==
''Funky Bones'' was installed at the Indianapolis Museum of Art in May 2010 and is currently on temporary loan.&lt;ref name="Sheets"/&gt; The artwork arose from many disparate interests of Joep van Lieshout, the founder and head designer of AVL. These include [[human anatomy]] &lt;ref name="Schengen"&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Acres Sculpture Park in Indianapolis|publisher=Schengen Visas Organization|url=http://www.schengenvisas.org/2011/07/100-acres-sculpture-park-in-indianapolis/|accessdate=28 Aug 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331185139/http://www.schengenvisas.org/2011/07/100-acres-sculpture-park-in-indianapolis/|archivedate=2012-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the history of the site. Concerning the original concept and inspiration behind ''Funky Bones'', Joep van Lieshout stated:

{{quote|I came up with [this] design that is not only a site specific artwork referring to the history of the continent, but also provides a function and will improve the stay of the park's visitors.  Even as a child I knew the state Indiana and Indianapolis as an exotic place where the 'Indians' came from and were living, and even though this is not true, it is important for my proposition.  Another field of interest is the history of art and especially in early developments of art from primitive and native cultures.  In early art forms, techniques and skills were not so developed and the artworks were made in a very basic way, therefore art had a direct relation to the people, its time and environment.  Native American art, design, and architecture produced beautiful artifacts, religion, and lifestyle, but after the appearance of the 'more advanced' culture from the east the original inhabitants were moved around and dispersed.  The very few things that remained are their cultural heritage and artifacts scattered around.  At this time of rapid production and consumption, their primitive lifestyle, close to nature, seems to become a necessary utopia.  The dislocated Funky Bone benches installed in the park stand symbolic for the leftovers of their sold culture and the spread of Native Americans over the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=Nicole|author2=Richard McCoy|title=The Outdoor Sculptures of 100 Acres: A Report for the Objects and Variable Art Laboratory at the Indianapolis Museum of Art|journal=Indianapolis Museum of Art|year=2011|location=Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to resonating with the location's history, ''Funky Bones'' also has the functional purpose of providing an ideal spot for visitors to sit, [[picnic]], lounge, or climb.&lt;ref name="Sheets"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheets|first=Hilarie M.|title=100 Acres to Roam, No Restrictions|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/arts/design/13park.html|accessdate=2011-08-28|date=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joep van Lieshout observed visitors sitting on rocks during visits to the site, and decided to provide them with more comfortable seating arrangements in order to facilitate interaction, both among viewers as well as between viewer and art.&lt;ref name="fact sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Funky Bones, Atelier Van Lieshout|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|url=http://www.resnicowschroeder.com/rsa/upload/PM/493_Filename_Art%20Nature%20Park%20Fact%20Sheet_Atelier%20Van%20Leishout.pdf|accessdate=25 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This degree of interactivity, and even fun, makes ''Funky Bones'' extremely child-friendly.&lt;ref name="Wiltrout"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wiltrout|first=Nicole|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art's 100 Acres|publisher=Indiana Insider|date=19 Jul 2011|url=http://www.in.gov/visitindiana/blog/index.php/2011/07/19/indianapolis-museum-of-arts-100-acres/|accessdate=5 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist==
Atelier Van Lieshout (AVL) is a multidisciplinary company that operates internationally in the field of contemporary art, design, and architecture.  Joep van Lieshout (born 1963), founder of AVL, is a Dutch artist born in Ravenstein, The Netherlands.  He received his formal education and training from the Academy of Modern Art in Rotterdam (1980–1985), [[Ateliers '63]] in Haarlem (1985-1987), and from the [[Villa Arson]] in Nice, France (1987).  Joep van Lieshout formed the AVL studio group in 1995 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where the company continues to design and fabricate their widely exhibited works.  Atelier Van Lieshout has attained international recognition for objects-based projects that balance on the boundary between art, architecture and design.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}  Recurring themes in the work of AVL include self-sufficiency, power, politics, and the more classical themes of life and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atelier Van Lieshout webpage|publisher=Atelier Van Lieshout|url=http://www.ateliervanlieshout.com/|accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name Atelier Van Lieshout emphasizes the fact that, although Joep van Lieshout founded and leads the collective, the work produced stems from the creative impulses of the entire team.&lt;ref name="Benda"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atelier Van Lieshout|publisher=Friedman Benda|url=http://www.friedmanbenda.com/artists/atelier-van-lieshout/bio/|accessdate=28 Aug 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127053738/http://www.friedmanbenda.com/artists/atelier-van-lieshout/bio/|archivedate=2011-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Funky Bones,'' AVL's most relevant recurring themes are domestication, politics, complex functioning systems, and the re-contextualization of familiar, domestic objects.  The Atelier van Lieshout claims to make no distinction between "real artworks" and "just building something for someone."&lt;ref name="Dellinger"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dellinger|first=Jade|author2=Hester Schaaf|title=FAQ's about the Atelier Van Lieshout|journal=REVEALED!!! STAFF TELLS ALL ...|year=1998|pages=31|publisher=Nicoline Gatehouse|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The studio group focuses on creating artworks whose design principles challenge conventional ideas of utility and functionality by reinventing how the viewer perceives or approaches an object and the environment in which it is placed.  This is achieved by the implementation of  non-traditional materials and color palettes, odd or unusual subject matter, and through the strategic positioning or locale of the artwork.&lt;ref name="Dellinger"/&gt; ''Funky Bones'' is impossible to see in its entirety except at a distance, preferably from above. Moving close enough to actually interact with it produces an entirely different perspective.&lt;ref name="Schengen"/&gt;

==Condition==
In general, the bones require regular cleaning in order to maintain their white color. Instrumental analysis involving the artwork's color and gloss levels has been recorded for future reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peters|first=Nicole|title=Art, Color, and Gloss|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/blog/2011/07/13/art-color-and-gloss/|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the book ''[[The Fault in Our Stars]]'', by Indianapolis-based author [[John Green (author)|John Green]], the sculpture is the location of a romantic picnic, having been picked by one of the characters as being the most Dutch place in Indianapolis. ''Funky Bones'' was recreated in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] for the film adaptation of ''The Fault in Our Stars''. The recreation was built by set designers, with help from the artist and Sarah Urist Green, wife of John Green, and former Curator of Contemporary Art at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=John|title=Question Tuesday: The Fault in Our Stars Movie Edition|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_731GRjCCI|work=vlogbrothers YouTube Channel|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6082">The '''Gold Blend couple''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television advertising]] campaign for [[Nescafé]] Gold Blend [[instant coffee]]. The original campaign ran for twelve 45-second instalments between [[1987 in television|1987]] and [[1993 in television|1993]]. It starred [[Anthony Head]] and [[Sharon Maughan]] as Tony and Sharon, a couple who begin a slow-burning romance over a cup of the advertised coffee. The ads were in a [[serial (radio and television)|serial]] format, with each ad ending on a [[cliffhanger]]. The commercials were extremely popular, and as time went on, the appearance of a new instalment would merit considerable media attention. The ads were developed by [[McCann Erickson]]. They are one of the most famous examples of serialized advertising.

Beginning in 1990, new versions of the ads were produced for the [[United States|American]] market, where Gold Blend was called "Taster's Choice," and the ads were referred to as the "Taster's Choice saga". Head and Maughan reprised their roles, but used American accents in the reshot ads. After the first two nearly identical ads, the American ads diverged into their own storyline.

The campaign was a remarkable success, producing various tie-in products, including a novelization entitled ''Love Over Gold'' by [[Susan Moody]], a video compilation of the ads, and two music CDs. The ads had a notable effect on sales, increasing them over 50% in the UK alone. They have been heralded as a premier example of [[positioning (marketing)|positioning]], creating an atmosphere of sophistication while remaining relatable. They were frequently compared to a [[soap opera]], even sometimes favorably compared to their contemporaries, such as ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'', or ''[[thirtysomething (TV series)|thirtysomething]]''. Famously, Head and Maughan appeared on the cover of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' after their campaign concluded and the two characters confessed their love for each other.

In later years, there were two additional series of ads starring new couples. The second series starred [[Louise Hunt]] and [[Mark Aiken]] and focused on a younger, more career-oriented woman, running for six instalments until 1997. In 1998, a new version with [[Simone Bendix]] and [[Neil Roberts (actor)|Neil Roberts]] began, but the campaign was discontinued after only one ad.

In 2005, the campaign ranked at number 20 on "[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s Best Ever Ads".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thinkbox.tv/server/show/nav.943 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305130459/http://thinkbox.tv/server/show/nav.943 |archivedate=2009-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had ranked at number 31 in a [[100 Greatest (UK TV series)|similar list]] compiled in 2000 aired on [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uktvadverts.com/facts/?list=ch4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visual art ==
Govy is best known for her interactive art piece "Photographic Diary"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dontstareatthesun.com/photographic-diary-20002001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alejandroalvarez-avt180.blogspot.fr/2012/04/photographic-diary-project-2001-by.html|title=the photographic-diary project (2001)|last=|first=|date=2012-04-07|website=alejandroalvarez-avt180.blogspot.fr|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2000 – 2001) in which she took series of photographs every day during a year&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classic.rhizome.org/artbase/artwork/2988/|title=Rhizome {{!}} Photographic Diary|last=|first=|date=2002-07-19|website=classic.rhizome.org|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the series of [[Japanese bondage|Shibari]] [[Installation art|installations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://animalnewyork.com/2012/tiny-victorian-armchairs-in-japanese-rope-bondage/|title=Tiny Victorian Armchairs in Japanese Rope Bondage|last=|first=|date=2012-01-23|work=|newspaper=ANIMAL|language=en-US|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Serial Bondage"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://design-milk.com/serial-bondage-by-kennedy-james/|title=Serial Bondage by Kennedy James|last=|first=|date=2012-01-27|work=|newspaper=Design Milk|language=en-US|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2006 – 2013) which incorporates her peculiar fascination with Japanese rituals and aesthetics.

Since 2015, govy has been focusing more on science and space art projects.

From 2001 until 2008, she has been using the artist name "Jimmy Owenns"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heure-exquise.org/auteur.php?id=1294&amp;l=uk|title=heure exquise - jimmy owenns|last=|first=|date=|website=heure-exquise.org|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the tagline "Artist Without a Sexual Identity".

== Early work ==
Before debuting her visual work with photography, govy performed in a few theater, video pieces and films but then decided to focus on writing. In 1999, she published the first book on the internet that actually looked like a real book,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dontstareatthesun.com/press/#/tlramafr-2001/|title=telerama|last=|first=|date=2001|website=govy|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would be published in 2001 under the title "Mes Cendres Nues"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mes Cendres Nues|last=|first=|publisher=IDLivre|year=2001|isbn=2-7479-0036-3|location=Paris|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by French publisher IDLivre. Her early wiritng is also part of the French Poetry Anthology "Les Nouveaux Poètes Français et Francophones",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Les Nouveaux Poètes Français et Francophones|last=French Poetry Anthology|first=|publisher=Edition Huguet|year=2004|isbn=2915412006|location=Paris|pages=179|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by Edition Huguet in 2004.

In 2000 she started an interactive piece where she would photograph her daily life&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2002|title=Fotografías De Una Vida|url=http://www.dontstareatthesun.com/press/#/ciclo-2002/|journal=Ciclo|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; during one year without interruption.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dontstareatthesun.com/press/#/readme-2002/|title=A Year of Emotions "Incarcerated" in a Photographic Diary|last=Yamada|first=Ryoji|date=2002-06-12|website=ReadMe|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early piece launched her career as a visual artist&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bagot|first=Laurence|date=2002|title=Photographic-Diary|url=http://www.dontstareatthesun.com/press/#/photophiles-2002/|journal=PHOTOPHILES|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it was one of the first interactive pieces on the internet at the time and created before the fashion of photographic diaries via blogs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.ocad.ca/wordpress/cs07nl/online-art-project-review/?doing_wp_cron=1478021540.5767090320587158203125|title=Online Art Project Review {{!}} Carolyn's Blog|website=blog.ocad.ca|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; would start spreading worldwide in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004|title=Les Nouveaux Journaux Intimes|url=http://www.dontstareatthesun.com/press/#/lexpress-mag-2004/|journal=L’EXPRESS MAG|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retrospect, it could be considered an art piece very much about growing up on the [[Autism spectrum|Autism Spectrum]] and struggling with a personal quest of identity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This work has received two awards and has been exhibited internationally in art galleries and museums.

{{Main article|1632 series|The Grantville Gazettes}}

'''''Grantville Gazette II''''' is the third collaborative anthology published in print set in the [[1632-verse]] [[shared universe]] in what is best regarded as a canonical sub-series of the popular [[alternate history]] that began with the February 2000 publication of the hardcover novel [[1632 (novel)|1632]] by author-historian [[Eric Flint]]. Baen Books and Flint decline the distinction, counting this book as the sixth published work. Overall it is also the third anthology in printed publication in the atypical series which consists of a mish-mash of main novels and anthologies produced under popular demand after publication of the initial novel which was written as a stand-alone work.

Down-time German [[Lutheran]] pastor Steffan Schultheiss in Badenburg is wary of the citizens of Grantville shortly after its appearance due to their modern views on religion; in which he warns his flock against Grantville in order to keep their modern progressing influence from corrupting his congregation. However, Schultheiss's religious warnings were not heeded due to politics and economics both made Grantville attractive to Badenburg. Schultheiss continued to condemn Grantville's practices until his outcries infuriated his wife, who has a positive view on Grantville. Eventually, with guidance from his wife, Schultheiss changed his stance on Grantville and becomes more tolerated on the Americans' ideals, including [[freedom of religion]].

==="Bottom-Feeders"===
:by John Zeek

The story is a police procedural that follows two policemen Jurgen Neubert, a down-time farmer and former [[mercenary soldier]] turned cop, and Marvin Tipton, a long service cop, through a murder case.

==="An Invisible War"===
:by Danita Ewing

"An Invisible War" is a short novel that was the first serialized piece of longer fiction that spanned this and the next Gazette in their e-published versions—though the whole (110 pages) was published in the hardcover release of ''Grantville Gazette II''. The tale set mostly in 1633 after Grantville has had time to settle-in and look beyond immediate survival issues. It deals with public health and integration and dissemination of medical knowledge efforts during the end of the Confederated Principalities of Europe and early United States of Europe period, for the various Mike Stearns-led administration's have been repeatedly reminded by {{nowrap|[[List of 1632 fictional characters#Nichols, James|Dr. James Nichols]]}} and [[List of 1632 fictional characters#Mailey, Melissa|Melissa Mailey]] how vulnerable populations are and were to diseases in the seventeenth century era—so the up-timers have been both strategically aware and taking steps from the outset within their capabilities and resources to mitigate any preventable health problems beginning in the novel [[1632 (novel)|1632]]. To add impetus and urgency, as time goes by in the experience of Grantville, some of the historical research conducted in the two libraries reveals that plague outbreaks occurred locally in OTL in diverse regions during 1632, 1634, and 1635 saw a large epidemic-size outbreak. Worse, the historical record might also indicate other outbreaks, which were poorly documented.

The story is one of Grantville's medical personnel meeting head-on with down-timer University practices, prejudices and a college curricula based in large part on the [[Classics]] and [[theology|Theological]] studies. The town establishes the Lahey Clinic hospital near the Grantville High School and establishes a local nurse training program in 1631–1632, and by the summer of 1633 has reached out to the faculty of the University of Jena, but the only spareable medical manpower to head up a college of medicine are... women!

[[File:Empty Frames at Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.jpg|thumb|right|The frame which once held ''[[The Storm on the Sea of Galilee]]''|alt=An empty frame hanging on a wall, between several portraits]]

On March 18, 1990, 13 works of art valued at a combined total of $500 million were [[art theft|stolen]] from the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] in [[Boston]]. In the early hours, guards admitted two men posing as police officers responding to a disturbance call. Once inside, the thieves tied up the guards and over the next hour committed the largest-value recorded theft of private property in history. Despite efforts by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and multiple probes around the world, no arrests have been made and no works have been recovered. The museum initially offered a reward of $5 million for information leading to the art's recovery, but in 2017 this was temporarily doubled to $10 million, with an expiration date set to the end of the year. This was extended into 2018 following helpful tips from the public.

The stolen works had originally been purchased by art collector [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]] (1840–1924) and intended to be left on permanent display at the museum with the rest of her collection. Since the collection and its layout are permanent, empty frames remain hanging both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for their potential return. Experts are puzzled by the choice of paintings that were stolen, especially since more valuable artwork was left untouched. Among the stolen works was ''[[The Concert (Vermeer)|The Concert]]'', one of only 34 known works by [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]] and thought to be the most valuable unrecovered painting, valued at over $200 million.{{when|At the time of the theft, or when since?|date=March 2018}} Also missing is ''[[The Storm on the Sea of Galilee]]'', [[Rembrandt]]'s only known [[seascape]]. Other works by Rembrandt, [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], and [[Govaert Flinck|Flinck]] were also stolen.

According to the FBI, the stolen artwork was moved through the region and offered for sale in [[Philadelphia]] during the early 2000s. They believe the thieves were members of a [[Organized crime|criminal organization]] based in the  [[Mid-Atlantic states|mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]]. They also claim to have targeted two suspects, although they have not been publicly identified and are now deceased. Boston gangster [[Robert Donati|Bobby Donati]], murdered in 1991 as a result of ongoing gang wars, has been cited as a possible collaborator in the heist. Significant evidence suggests that [[Hartford, Connecticut]] gangster Robert Gentile knows the location of the works, although he denies involvement.

==Robbery==
Around midnight on Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red [[Dodge Daytona]] pulled up near the side entrance of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt;&lt;ref name=searchcont /&gt; Two men with fake police uniforms waited for at least an hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a [[Saint Patrick's Day]] party nearby.&lt;ref name=abathstory&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/03/10/guard-who-opened-door-robbers-notorious-gardner-museum-heist-under-suspicion-years-later/1TUiDyi1GbcnBgQT64oISP/story.html |title=Decades after the Gardner heist, police focus on guard |first=Stephen |last=Kurkjian |work=Boston Globe |date=March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928031507/http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/03/10/guard-who-opened-door-robbers-notorious-gardner-museum-heist-under-suspicion-years-later/1TUiDyi1GbcnBgQT64oISP/story.html |archivedate=September 28, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later at around 1{{nbsp}}a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with a fellow guard, the only other person in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.&lt;ref name = abathstory /&gt;

[[File:ISGardnerMuseum.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum|Gardner Museum]] in 2008|alt=refer to caption]]

At 1:24{{nbsp}}a.m., one of the two men outside pushed the buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen who heard of a disturbance in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men.&lt;ref name = abathstory /&gt; When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax.&lt;ref name = abathstory /&gt; The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.&lt;ref name=insider&gt;{{cite news|date=May 2009 |first=Milton |last=Esterow |title=Inside the Gardner Case |url=http://www.artnews.com/2009/05/01/inside-the-gardner-case/ |work=ArtNews |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225044341/http://www.artnews.com/2009/05/01/inside-the-gardner-case/ |archivedate=December 25, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the museum was equipped with motion detectors, the thieves' movements throughout the museum were recorded. After tying up the guards, the thieves went upstairs to the Dutch Room. As one of them approached [[Rembrandt]]'s ''Self-Portrait'' (1629), a local alarm sounded, which they immediately smashed. They pulled the painting off the wall and  attempted to take the wooden panel out of its heavy frame. Unsuccessful at the attempt, they left the painting on the floor. They cut Rembrandt's ''[[The Storm on the Sea of Galilee]]'' out of the frame, as well as ''[[A Lady and Gentleman in Black]]''.  They also removed [[Vermeer]]'s ''[[The Concert (Vermeer)|The Concert]]'' and [[Govaert Flinck]]'s ''[[Landscape with Obelisk]]'' from their frames. Additionally, they also took a Chinese bronze [[Gu (vessel)|gu]] from the [[Shang dynasty]].&lt;ref name=insider /&gt;

Elsewhere in the museum, they stole five [[Degas]] drawings and an eagle [[finial]]. The finial sat at the top of a [[Napoleon]]ic flag, which they attempted to unscrew from the wall, but failed.&lt;ref name=livescience /&gt; [[Manet]]'s ''[[Chez Tortoni]]'' was also stolen from its location in the Blue Room. Motion detector records show that the only footsteps detected in the Blue Room that night were at 12:27{{nbsp}}a.m. and again at 12:53{{nbsp}}a.m. These times match to when Abath said he passed through on patrol. The frame for the painting was found on security chief Lyle W. Grindle's chair near the front desk.&lt;ref name = abathstory /&gt; The thieves made two trips to their car with artwork during the theft, which lasted 81 minutes. Before leaving, they visited the guards once more, telling them "You'll be hearing from us in about a year," although they were never heard from again.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; The guards remained handcuffed until police arrived at 8:15{{nbsp}}a.m. later that morning.&lt;ref name=insider /&gt;

==Stolen artwork==
Altogether, thirteen pieces were stolen at an estimated loss of $500 million, making the robbery the largest recorded private property theft in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2012/03/hot-canvases |title=Hot Canvases: A new book shatters myths about art theft |first=David |last=Menconi |work=Harvard Magazine |date=March–April 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322000716/http://harvardmagazine.com/2012/03/hot-canvases |archivedate=March 22, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Empty frames remain hanging in the museum, both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for their potential return.&lt;ref name=McShane&gt;{{cite book |last= McShane |first= Thomas |title= Stolen Masterpiece Tracker |year= 2006 |publisher= Barricade Books |isbn=978-1-56980-314-1 |first2= Dary |last2= Matera |chapter= 18.

==Investigation==
The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] took control of the case on the grounds that the artwork would likely cross state lines.&lt;ref name=nydn /&gt; They have conducted hundreds of interviews with probes stretching across the world involving [[Scotland Yard]], [[Japan]]ese and [[France|French]] authorities, private investigators, museum directors, and art dealers.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; The FBI believes the thieves were members of a [[Organized crime|criminal organization]] based in the [[Mid-Atlantic states|mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]], and that the stolen paintings were moved through [[Connecticut]] and the [[Philadelphia]] area in the years following the theft. Some of the art may have been offered for sale in Philadelphia in the early 2000s, including ''The Storm on the Sea of Galilee''; however, their knowledge of what happened to the works after the attempted sale is limited.&lt;ref name=searchcont /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= FBI Says It Has Clues in '90 Boston Art Heist |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/us/fbi-says-it-has-clues-in-1990-isabella-stewart-gardner-museum-art-heist.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=0 |work= The New York Times |accessdate= March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fbipress1&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/boston/press-releases/2013/fbi-provides-new-information-regarding-the-1990-isabella-stewart-gardner-museum-art-heist |title=FBI Provides New Information Regarding the 1990 Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum Art Heist: Information Sought from Those in Philadelphia and Connecticut Who May Have Knowledge of the Art's Location |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Division |first=Greg |last=Comcowich |date=March 18, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710143612/https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/boston/press-releases/2013/fbi-provides-new-information-regarding-the-1990-isabella-stewart-gardner-museum-art-heist |archivedate=July 10, 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI stated it believed it knew the identity of the thieves in 2013, but in 2015 announced that they were now deceased.

[[File:Sketches of Suspects Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum Theft.jpg|thumb|right|Sketches of the suspects|alt=refer to caption]]
No single motive or pattern has emerged through the thousands of pages of evidence gathered.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; The selection of works puzzles the experts, specifically since more valuable artworks were available.&lt;ref name=McShane /&gt; The FBI's lead agent assigned to the case, Geoffrey J. Kelly, finds it difficult to understand why this assortment of items was stolen despite the thieves being in the museum for enough time to take whatever they wished. On their way to the finial, the thieves passed by two [[Raphael]]s and a [[Botticelli]] painting.&lt;ref name=insider /&gt; [[Titian]]'s ''[[The Rape of Europa (Titian)|The Rape of Europa]]'', which is one of the museum's most well-known and valuable pieces, was not stolen.&lt;ref name=insider /&gt; Due to the brutish ways the criminals handled the robbery, cutting the paintings from their frames and smashing frames for two Degas sketches, investigators believe the thieves were amateur criminals, not experts commissioned to steal particular works.&lt;ref name = abathstory /&gt; Some investigators believe the works were destroyed, explaining why they have not reappeared.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt; Theories on the theft include that it was organized by the [[Irish Republican Army]] in order to raise money or bargain for the release of imprisoned comrades. Another theory states [[Whitey Bulger]] was the ringleader of the theft. At the time of the heist, he was Boston's top crime boss and an FBI informant.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt;

The museum first offered a [[Bounty (reward)|reward]] of $1 million, but that was later increased to $5 million in 1997.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt;  The reward is for "information that leads directly to the recovery of all of [their] items in good condition",&lt;ref name=fbipress1 /&gt; which remains on offer more than a quarter-century later.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; In May 2017, the bounty was doubled to $10 million, with an expiration date set for midnight on December 31 of that year.&lt;ref name="10million"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardner Museum staff|title=Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum : Gardner Museum doubles reward to $10 million for return of stolen art|url=http://www.gardnermuseum.org/resources/theft/reward_doubled|website=www.gardnermuseum.org|accessdate=May 26, 2017|language=en|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/arts/design/gardner-museum-doubles-reward-for-recovery-of-stolen-masterpieces.html |title=Gardner Museum Doubles Reward for Recovery of Stolen Masterpieces |last=Bowley |first=Graham |date=May 23, 2017 |work=The New York Times |access-date=May 24, 2017 |issn=0362-4331 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524073316/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/arts/design/gardner-museum-doubles-reward-for-recovery-of-stolen-masterpieces.html |archivedate=May 24, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Murphy |first=Shelley |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/12/15/million-reward-for-stolen-gardner-museum-artwork-set-expire-end/3PD4IlwNU26FKpo4hLUCzK/story.html |title=$10m reward for stolen Gardner museum artwork set to expire at end of 2017 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=December 15, 2017 |accessdate=December 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This reward was extended into 2018 following an outpouring of tips from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=$10M Reward Extended For Return Of Stolen Gardner Museum Art|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/01/11/isabella-stewart-gardner-museum-heist-reward-extended/|website=CBS|accessdate=January 16, 2018|language=en|date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal authorities have stated they will not charge anyone who voluntarily turns in the artwork, but anyone caught knowingly in possession of stolen items could be prosecuted.&lt;ref name=searchcont /&gt;&lt;ref name=suffolk_globe /&gt; The thieves cannot face charges because the five-year statute of limitations has expired.&lt;ref name=searchcont&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murphy |first1=Shelley |title=Search for artworks from Gardner heist continues 25 years later |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/03/17/gardner-museum-art-heist-one-boston-most-enduring-mysteries-years-later/9U3tp1kJMa4Zn4uClI1cdM/story.html |work=The Boston Globe |accessdate=February 12, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215221154/https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/03/17/gardner-museum-art-heist-one-boston-most-enduring-mysteries-years-later/9U3tp1kJMa4Zn4uClI1cdM/story.html |archivedate=February 15, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of DNA evidence===
In 2010, the FBI announced that some evidence from the original crime scene had been sent to the FBI's Laboratory in [[Quantico, Virginia]], for retesting with the hope of finding new [[DNA]] evidence to identify the culprits of the theft.

In June 2017, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported that some of the crime scene evidence collected by the FBI was missing.  Even after an exhaustive search, they were unable to locate [[handcuffs]] and [[duct tape]] used to immobilize the museum's two security guards that could have contained traces of the thieves' DNA material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Murphy |first=Shelley |last2=Kurkjian |first2=Stephen |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/06/12/evidence-gardner-museum-thefts-that-might-bear-dna-missing/bQgapZNs1FKlTczoAijqnJ/story.html |title=Evidence in Gardner Museum thefts that might bear DNA is missing |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=June 12, 2017 |accessdate=June 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leads===
In 1994, the museum director Anne Hawley received a letter that promised the return of the pieces for $2.6 million. If interested, the museum had to get ''The Boston Globe'' to publish a coded message in a business story. The message was published, but nothing further was heard once law enforcement got involved.&lt;ref name=nydn /&gt;

Late one night in 1997, ''[[Boston Herald]]'' reporter Tom Mashberg was driven to a warehouse in [[Red Hook, Brooklyn]] by William Youngworth, a career criminal and associate of New England art thief Myles Connor Jr.,&lt;ref name=nydn /&gt; to see what was purported to be ''The Storm on the Sea of Galilee''. Mashberg had been investigating the theft and was briefly allowed to view the painting with a flashlight. He was given a vial of paint chips for authenticity. These were later confirmed by experts to be fragments of Dutch 17th-century origin—but not from the stolen painting.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; It was never concretely determined to be real or fake, and the FBI quit dealing with Youngworth after not making any progress.&lt;ref name=nydn /&gt; The painting has since disappeared.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt;

[[File:Suffolk Downs.jpg|thumb|right|[[Suffolk Downs]] was searched in December 2015 without result|alt=Suffolk Downs]]
On August 6, 2015, police released a video from the night before the theft that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape: one remains unidentified, while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the unidentified man into the museum twice within a few minutes. The man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a car and drove off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New video shows possible dry run for Gardner Museum art Heist |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2015/08/06/new-video-shows-possible-dry-run-for-gardner-museum-art-heist/rxxqmXXfKI8ap180aT2BjL/story.html?p1=ClickedOnBreakingNewsBox |website=boston.com |accessdate=February 12, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125203802/http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2015/08/06/new-video-shows-possible-dry-run-for-gardner-museum-art-heist/rxxqmXXfKI8ap180aT2BjL/story.html?p1=ClickedOnBreakingNewsBox |archivedate=January 25, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police say the video opens new lines of investigation, and ''[[The New York Times]]'' points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones |first1=Jonathan |title=Is America's greatest art heist about to be solved? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/aug/07/americas-greatest-art-heist-solved-isabella-stewart-gardner-museum |website=The Guardian |accessdate=February 12, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214212739/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/aug/07/americas-greatest-art-heist-solved-isabella-stewart-gardner-museum |archivedate=February 14, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the guards had previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; &amp;ndash; which is not to say they could not have been collaborators.

In December 2015 FBI agents searched  [[East Boston]]'s [[Suffolk Downs]] [[horse racing]] track, acting on a tip consistent with rumors among Suffolk Downs employees in the 1990s that the stolen art was there. Stables, parts of the grandstand closed since the early 1990s, and two safes (which had to be drilled open) were searched without result.&lt;ref name=suffolk_globe&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kurkjian |first1=Stephen |title=Search of Suffolk Downs for Gardner Museum masterpieces came up empty |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/12/27/search-suffolk-downs-for-gardner-museum-masterpieces-came-empty/H1iiRlZopLFfxOkM9Nm41J/story.html |work=The Boston Globe |accessdate=January 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231020612/http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/12/27/search-suffolk-downs-for-gardner-museum-masterpieces-came-empty/H1iiRlZopLFfxOkM9Nm41J/story.html |archivedate=December 31, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential perpetrators===
{{further|Robert Donati#Possible role in Gardner Museum theft}}

Boston [[gangster]] [[Bobby Donati]] may have been involved in the heist. New England art thief Myles J. Connor Jr., in prison at the time of the robbery, has stated that he and associate Bobby Donati eyed the museum in the 1980s and Donati oversaw the operation.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; Shortly before the robbery, Donati was seen at a nightclub with a sack of police uniforms.&lt;ref name=nydn /&gt; Donati worked under Boston crime boss [[Vincent M. Ferrara|Vincent Ferrara]], and visited him in prison in the early 1990s. When Ferrara asked about the robbery, Donati said he "buried the stuff" and would find a way to negotiate his release. Donati was murdered in 1991 as a result of ongoing gang wars.&lt;ref name=nydn /&gt;

[[Hartford, Connecticut]], gangster Robert "Bobby the Cook" Gentile has been suggested on multiple occasions as knowing the location of the Gardner works.&lt;ref name=suffolk_globe /&gt;&lt;ref name=courant /&gt; In May 2012, FBI agents searched Gentile's home in [[Manchester, Connecticut|Manchester]], Connecticut. They did not find any stolen works, despite searching his preferred hiding spot beneath a false floor with the help of his son. However, in the basement, they found a sheet of paper listing what each stolen piece might draw on the [[black market]].&lt;ref name=suffolk_globe /&gt; In January 2016, the FBI contrived gun charges against Gentile to force him to reveal the location of the missing works. During a hearing, a federal prosecutor revealed significant evidence tying Gentile to the crime. The prosecutor stated that Gentile and mob partner Robert Guarente attempted to use the return of two stolen pieces to reduce a prison sentence for one of their associates. Guarente's wife told investigators in early 2015 that her husband once had possession of some of the art, and gave two paintings to Gentile before Guarente died of cancer in 2004. Also, while in federal prison during 2013–2014, Gentile told at least three people he had knowledge of the stolen art.  In 2015, Gentile submitted to a [[polygraph|lie detector]] test, denying advanced knowledge of the heist or ever possessing any paintings. The result showed a 0.1% chance that he was truthful.&lt;ref name=courant&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahoney |first1=Edmund H. |title=Prosecutors Reveal More Evidence They Say Ties Robert Gentile To Gardner Museum Robbery |url=http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-robert-gentile-gardner-museum-art-heist-0107-20160106-story.html |website=courant.com |publisher=Hartford Courant |accessdate=January 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082228/http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-robert-gentile-gardner-museum-art-heist-0107-20160106-story.html |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gentile's lawyer, federal agents are convinced that Gentile has the stolen works.&lt;ref name=suffolk_globe /&gt; Gentile's home was searched again by the FBI on May 2, 2016, even though his lawyer insists that if Gentile had the stolen artwork or knowledge of its whereabouts, he would have turned it in for the reward money a long time ago.&lt;ref name="wcvb2may"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.wcvb.com/news/fbi-returns-to-home-of-man-linked-to-500m-art-heist/39340372 |title=FBI searching mobster's home for stolen Gardner masterpieces |website=WCVB |access-date=May 2, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510215744/http://m.wcvb.com/news/fbi-returns-to-home-of-man-linked-to-500m-art-heist/39340372 |archivedate=May 10, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 5, 2017, Gentile was scheduled to be sentenced for a separate weapons charge in Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-robert-gentile-gardner-museum-sentencing-20170905-story.html|title=Feds Say Gentile's Feigning Mental Issues, But Gangster's Sentencing Postponed|last=MAHONY|first=EDMUND H.|work=courant.com|access-date=September 5, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the museum raised its bounty in 1997, Myles J. Connor Jr. said he could locate the missing artwork in exchange for [[legal immunity]]. Authorities rejected his offer. Connor now believes that the Gardner works have passed into other, unknown hands. "I was probably told, but I don't remember," he said, blaming a heart attack that affected his memory.&lt;ref name ="Smithsonian" /&gt; Louis Royce, another Boston area gangster, claims he is still owed 15% for devising the plan for two fake policemen to request access to the museum at night.&lt;ref name=nydn&gt;{{cite web|last1=Connelly |first1=Sherryl |title=Possible leads in $500M Boston museum robbery in 1990 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/leads-500m-boston-museum-robbery-1990-article-1.2115903  |work=New York Daily News |accessdate=January 8, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213151704/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/leads-500m-boston-museum-robbery-1990-article-1.2115903 |archivedate=December 13, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high profile Gardner Museum theft has been referenced and parodied in many different works. It was the subject of the 2005 documentary ''Stolen'', which first appeared in a slightly different version on [[Court TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalfilmcircuit.com/stolen/pressbook_stolen.pdf |title=Stolen: Is it still a masterpiece if no one can find it? |first=Rebecca |last=Dreyfus |date=April 13, 2006 |work=Stolen pressbook |publisher=International Film Circuit |accessdate=June 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713045940/http://www.internationalfilmcircuit.com/stolen/pressbook_stolen.pdf |archivedate=July 13, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more well-known paintings have been referenced in multiple TV shows, including ''[[The Blacklist (TV series)|The Blacklist]]'' episode "The Courier" (and an allusion to the Gardner Museum heist itself in the episode "Greyson Blaise"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/television/television_news/2013/10/starring_role_for_boston_on_new_hit_blacklist |title=Starring role for Boston on new hit Blacklist |first=Mark |last=Perigard |date=October 30, 2013 |publisher=Boston Herald |accessdate=December 9, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126132327/http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/television/television_news/2013/10/starring_role_for_boston_on_new_hit_blacklist |archivedate=January 26, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[American History X-cellent]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/television/television_news/2010/04/%E2%80%98simpsons%E2%80%99_cracks_case_gardner_heist |title='Simpsons' crack case of Gardner heist |date=April 13, 2010 |publisher=Boston Herald |accessdate=December 9, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126120453/http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/television/television_news/2010/04/%E2%80%98simpsons%E2%80%99_cracks_case_gardner_heist |archivedate=January 26, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Drunk History]]'' episode "Boston",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/uo66zq/drunk-history-art-heist---uncensored |title=Art Heist – Uncensored Drunk History Video Clip – Comedy Central |first=Mark |last=Perigard |date=July 30, 2013 |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=December 1, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222104921/http://www.cc.com/video-clips/uo66zq/drunk-history-art-heist---uncensored |archivedate=December 22, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[American Greed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100000093 |title=American Greed – Unsolved $300 Million Art Heist |date=October 14, 2012 |publisher=CNBC |accessdate=December 11, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222120206/http://www.cnbc.com/id/100000093 |archivedate=December 22, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karel Hašler''' (31 October 1879 in [[Prague]] – 22 December 1941 in [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]]) was a [[Czech people|Czech]] songwriter, actor, lyricist, film and theatre director, composer, writer, dramatist, screenwriter and cabaretier. He was murdered in the Mauthausen concentration camp.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web | title=Singer and songwriter Karel Hasler was born 125 years ago  | url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/58960 | work= | publisher=Radio Prague |author=Horáková, Pavla | date=8 October 2004 | accessdate=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Hašler studied to be a glove-maker, but he became intererested in theatre at a young age and occasionally performed with amateur theatre ensembles. In 1897, following his debut at the ''Aréna Theatre'' he left home and successively joined various travelling theatre companies.&lt;ref name="Fikejz367"&gt;[[#Fikejz|Fikejz (2006)]], p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902 he became a member of the Slovenian theatre in [[Ljubljana]], but soon moved back to Prague, where he joined the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]] ensemble.&lt;ref name="Fikejz367"/&gt; In the National Theatre, he asserted himself in conversational plays. In addition to that, he also attempted to apply his singing abilities. Around 1908, he started composing his own music, and at the same time he began to incline to cabaret activities.&lt;ref name="Fikejz367"/&gt; Gradually he became a director and head of various Prague cabarets, such as ''Lucerna'' (1910–1915, 1918–1923), ''Rokoko'' (1915–1918) and ''[[Karlín]] Variety Theatre'' (1924–1929). In 1908, he married a sister of pianist and composer [[Rudolf Friml]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Karel Hašler?

During [[World War I]] he also began to appear in [[silent film]]s, as an actor, director and author. In 1914, he made a comedy ''České hrady a zámky'' (Czech Castles), based on his own script. The film was intended as an introduction for the play ''Pán bez kvartýru'' (A Man Without Flat).&lt;ref name="Fikejz367"/&gt; He appeared also in the comedy 
''Ahasver'' and in other silent films.

Among his most successful film roles were the lawyer and deputy Uher in the drama film ''Batalion'' (The Battalion, 1927) by [[Přemysl Pražský]], and the organist in ''Varhaník u sv. Víta'' (Organist at [[St. Vitus Cathedral]], 1929) by [[Martin Frič]]. The coming era of the [[sound film]] in 1930s enabled Hašler to utilize his singing skills. In his first sound film role ''Písničkář'' (Balladeer, 1932) by [[Svatopluk Innemann]] he sang patriotic songs ''Svoboda'' (Freedom) and ''[[Ta naše písnička česká]]'' (Our Czech song), among others.&lt;ref name="Fikejz368"&gt;[[#Fikejz|Fikejz (2006)]], p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, in his last film role, he played himself in ''Za tichých nocí'' (In the Quiet Nights), made by his son Gina Hašler. From 1932 to 1941 Hašler played in more than 13 films. In September 1941, during production of the film ''Městečko na dlani'', based on the script by [[Jan Drda]], he was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and sent to the Mauthausen [[concentration camp]]. The main reason for his arrest was his patriotic songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Scény z prezidentské kuchyně" uvidí v Hradci Králové | url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/hradec/zpravy/_zprava/555132 | work= | publisher=Czech Radio – [[Hradec Králové]] | date= | accessdate=30 August 2009|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deyl300–303"&gt;[[#Deyl|Deyl (2007)]], p. 300–303&lt;/ref&gt; In Mauthausen he was tortured to death.&lt;ref name="Fikejz368"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web | title=Music Against the War | url=http://www.musicology.upol.cz/articles/against.html | work= | publisher=[[Palacký University, Olomouc]] | date= |author=Vičar, Jan | accessdate=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war [[Communist Czechoslovakia]] he was officially ignored for political reasons, because many of his songs hailed [[Tomáš Masaryk]] and [[Czechoslovak Legion]]naires, and mocked [[interbellum]] communists.&lt;ref&gt;"From Good King Wenceslas to the Good Soldier Švejk: A Dictionary of Czech Popular Culture", [https://books.google.com/books?id=6qlnrXT2yS0C&amp;pg=PA54 p. 54]&lt;/ref&gt;

''"Hašlerky"'' is a recognizable type of songs, written by Hašler and of similar character.

Czech astronomer [[Lenka Kotková]] (née L. Šarounová) named asteroid [[37939 Hašler]] after him.&lt;ref name="JP: Small-body Database Browser"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=37939 |  title = JPL Small-Body Database Browser | accessdate = 28 April 2008 | publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Czech directors Marek Jícha and Josef Lustig made a documentary ''Písničkář, který nezemřel'' (The Immortal Balladeer of Prague) describing the fate of Hašler's illegitimate son Thomas Hasler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Immortal Balladeer of Prague | url=http://www.kviff.com/en/film-archive-detail/20082274-the-immortal-balladeer-of-prague/ | work= | publisher=[[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]] | date= | accessdate=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of Hašler's 130th anniversary (2009) a monument by sculptor Stanislav Hanzík was unveiled at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Old Castle Steps|cs|3=Staré zámecké schody}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazin.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/pri-odhalovani-pomniku-haslerovi-davy-lidi-ucpaly-zamecke-schody/405438 ''Při odhalování pomníku Hašlerovi davy lidí ucpaly zámecké schody''] – České noviny, 31.&amp;nbsp;10. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ct24.cz/domaci/spolecnost/71172-praha-oslavila-130-vyroci-karla-haslera-odhalenim-pomniku/ ''Praha oslavila 130.&amp;nbsp;výročí Karla Hašlera odhalením pomníku''] – ČT24, 31.&amp;nbsp;10. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the band [[Patrola Šlapeto]] recorded a CD and DVD with 23 Hašler's songs based on original recordings found in musical archives. While there have been plenty recordings of Hasler's songs, this was the first in 80 years recording of the original tunes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/kultura/hudba/patrola-slapeto-nahrala-zapomenute-haslerovy-slagry_283011.html#.Ut9XTPTTli1 "Patrola Šlapeto nahrála zapomenuté Hašlerovy šlágry"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Karel Hašlers artistic output consists mainly of songs. He created more than 300 compositions, many of which became popular "folk songs". With his engaged patriotic approach he helped to strengthen the national consciousness of Czech people during times of danger and oppression.&lt;ref name="Fikejz368"/&gt; Following his death in the concentration camp, his songs became a symbol of national resistance.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

'''''Synopsis''''', also known as the '''''Kievan Synopsis''''' ({{Lang-ru|Синопсис, албо Краткое описание о начале русскаго народа}}) is work of history, first published in [[Kiev]] in 1674. It interprets history through a [[Christian conception of time]] focused on the narratives of [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]], [[fall of man|fall]], and [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aatseel.org/100111/pdf/5a7_2_rikoun.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It also had a political purpose to justify the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] which annexed the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] while also claiming a central role for the city of Kiev.

[[Innokentiy Gizel]] is generally considered to be the author of ''Synopsis'', however this is arguable. ''Synopsis'' was the first textbook on the subject of history written in any [[Slavic language]].{{fact|date=December 2017}} It was rather popular until the mid-19th century and survived some thirty editions. 

The book began with the history of the origins and lifestyle of the [[Slavic people|Slavs]] and ended with the mid-17th century in the first edition. The second and third editions (1678 and 1680) end with the [[Chigirin Campaigns]] of 1677-1678. ''Synopsis'' covers the history of [[Kievan Rus']], the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']], and the struggles against the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]], [[Ottoman Turkey]], and [[Kingdom of Poland|Poland]]. The author of the ''Synopsis'' asserted that the Russian [[tsar]]s were the legal successors of the [[Kiev]]an [[grand prince]]s. ''Synopsis'' is notable since it clearly demonstrates that the idea of uniting all [[East Slavic people]] under the authority of one state was born not in [[Moscow]] but in the south-western lands of former [[Kievan Rus']] and designed in Kiev.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The purpose of the work is to "achieve a precarious balance between glorifying the Muscovite tsar on the one hand and defending Kiev’s own claims to power on the other."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aatseel.org/100111/pdf/5a7_2_rikoun.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The appendix of the ''Synopsis'' contains lists of Russian princes, [[Poland|Polish]] [[Voivode]]s in [[Little Russia]], [[Cossack]] [[hetman]]s, and Kievan [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]]s.

|An analysis of around 14 succession candidates, in terms of five lineages with royal pretensions (including the [[House of Aviz]]). &lt;ref&gt;Mayer p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; This work put into play the succession, by suggesting that [[elective monarchy]], rather than [[hereditary monarchy]], was a more appropriate way to address the succession issue.

|[[Alexander Dicsone]]
|''Of the Right of the Crowne efter Hir Majesty''&lt;ref&gt;Mayer p. 91, 99-100&lt;/ref&gt;
|Commissioned by James VI, in answer to Doleman, with a related work by [[Walter Quin]]. Quin had made an oration on James's claim in 1596; but his book of 1598 on the same topic was refused by the printer, [[Robert Waldegrave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=22964|title=Quin, Walter|first=J. K.|last= McGinley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Ashfield (Catholic agent)|Edmund Ashfield]] had prompted James to respond to Doleman, stating that the literature in favour of his mother Mary Queen of Scots was now counter-productive.

Dicsone's work dealt with the four major points raised against James's claim: (a) Scottish birth; (b) the provisions of the [[will of Henry VIII]]; (c) the attainder of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] his mother; (d) his cadet status in the [[House of Lancaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayer p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

|James VI of Scotland
|''The Trew Law of Free Monarchies''
|This work, known for its support of the [[divine right of kings]], was also an intervention in the succession debate, through its rejection of the [[resistance theory]] in the tract of Doleman, and of the role of parliaments in determining succession.&lt;ref name="M99"/&gt;

|Watson claimed to have written a treatise circulated to the Privy Council, the queen and the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], against the [[Jesuit]] line on a Spanish succession in Doleman. It favoured the [[House of York]], the claim through the House of Aviz being Lancastrian.

== Description ==
The main feature of Lolita fashion is the volume of the skirt,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thelolitaguidebook.tumblr.com/anatomy|title=''Volume 3: The Anatomy of an Outfit'' on ''The Lolita Guide Book''|publisher=Tumblr|accessdate=11 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808152925/http://thelolitaguidebook.tumblr.com/anatomy|archivedate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; often created by wearing a [[petticoat]] or [[crinoline]]. The skirt can be either clock-shaped or A-shaped.&lt;ref name="K. Robinson 2014 p. 39"&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K. Robinson (2014) Empowered Princesses: An Ethnographic Examination of the Practices, Rituals, and Conflicts within Lolita Fashion Communities in the United States, Georgia State University, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Components of the Lolita wardrobe consist mainly of a [[blouse]] (long or short sleeves) with a skirt or a dress, which usually comes to the knees. Lolitas frequently wear fashion wigs in combination with other headwear such as hair bows or a bonnet (similar to a [[Poke bonnet]]). Lolitas sometimes also wear Victorian style drawers under their petticoats. For further effect, knee socks, ankle socks or tights together with either [[High-heeled footwear|high heels]] or flat shoes with a bow are worn. Other typical Lolita garments are a [[Jumper (dress)|jumperskirt]] (JSK) and one-piece (OP).&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_theses/87/ Chancy J. Gatlin (2014) The Fashion of Frill: The Art of Impression Management in the Atlanta Lolita and Japanese Street Fashion Community, Georgia State University, United States of America, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Although the origin of the fashion is unclear, it is likely that the movement started at the end of the 1960s with the fashion style and subculture Natural Kei, which romanticized the [[Victorian era|Victorian Period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fyeahlolita.blogspot.be/2013/11/why-is-lolita-called-lolita-does-lolita.html|title=''Why is Lolita called "Lolita"?

Some Lolitas say they enjoy the dress of the subculture simply because it is fun and not as a protest against traditional Japanese society.&lt;ref name="Y.

== Social-economical dimension ==
Much of the very early lolitas in the 1990s hand-made most of their clothing, and were inspired by the [[Japanese street fashion#Dolly kei|Dolly Kei movement]] of the previous decade.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"/&gt; Because of the diffusion of fashion magazines people were able to use lolita patterns to make their own clothing.{{Citation needed|reason=Where has this been said again?|date=March 2018}} Another way to own lolita was to buy it second-hand.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K. Robinson (2014) ''Empowered Princesses: An Ethnographic Examination of the Practices, Rituals, and Conflicts within Lolita Fashion Communities in the United States'', Georgia State University, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The do-it-yourself behaviour can be seen more frequently by people who cannot afford the expensive brands.&lt;ref&gt;http://eprints.utas.edu.au/15944/ S. Abigail Staite (2012) Atemporal Class-Play With tea and cakes, University of Tasmania, Australia, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because more retails stores were selling lolita fashion the do-it-yourself behaviour became less important.{{Citation needed|reason=
Where has this been said again?|date=March 2018}} Partly due to the rise of [[e-commerce]] and [[globalization]] it became possible to buy lolita clothing by Internet. The market was quickly divided into two main components: one which purchases mainly from Japanese or Chinese internet marketplaces, the other making use of shopping services to purchase Japanese brands,&lt;ref name="Young Kang &amp; T. Diane Cassidy (2015) pp. 371-384."/&gt; with some communities making larger orders as a group.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K. Robinson (2014) ''Empowered Princesses: An Ethnographic Examination of the Practices, Rituals, and Conflicts within Lolita Fashion Communities in the United States'', Georgia State University, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Not every online shop delivers quality lolita (inspired) [[Product (business)|products]], a notorious example is Milano (2014).&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K. Robinson (2014) ''Empowered Princesses: An Ethnographic Examination of the Practices, Rituals, and Conflicts within Lolita Fashion Communities in the United States'', Georgia State University, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; with some web shops selling brand replicas, a frowned upon behaviour from many in this community.&lt;ref name="Chancy J. Gatlin 2014 p. 93"&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_theses/87/ Chancy J. Gatlin (2014) ''The Fashion of Frill: The Art of Impression Management in the Atlanta Lolita and Japanese Street Fashion Community'', Georgia State University, United States of America, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; A Chinese replica [[Manufacturing|manufacturer]] that is famous for his replica design is Oo Jia.&lt;ref name="Chancy J. Gatlin 2014 p. 93"/&gt;

== Social-cultural dimension ==
Many lolitas considered being photographed without permission to be rude and disrespectful,&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K. Robinson (2014) ''Empowered Princesses: An Ethnographic Examination of the Practices, Rituals, and Conflicts within Lolita Fashion Communities in the United States'', Georgia State University, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_theses/87/ Chancy J.

Hardy Bernal (2011) ''The Lolita Complex: a Japanese fashion subculture and its paradoxes'', Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  however some rules differ or overlap in different parts of this community.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K. Robinson (2014) ''Empowered Princesses: An Ethnographic Examination of the Practices, Rituals, and Conflicts within Lolita Fashion Communities in the United States'', Georgia State University, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Lolitas often host meetings in public spaces such as parks, restaurants, cafes, shopping malls, public events, and festivals.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_theses/87/ Chancy J. Gatlin (2014) ''The Fashion of Frill: The Art of Impression Management in the Atlanta Lolita and Japanese Street Fashion Community'', Georgia State University, United States of America, pp. 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Some meetings take place at members' homes, and often have custom house rules (e.g. each member must bring their own cupcake to the meeting).&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_theses/87/ Chancy J. Gatlin (2014) ''The Fashion of Frill: The Art of Impression Management in the Atlanta Lolita and Japanese Street Fashion Community'', Georgia State University, United States of America, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Lolita meetings therefore are a social aspect of the lolita fashion community, serving as an opportunity for members to meet one another.{{Citation needed|reason=Where has this been said again?|date=March 2018}} Many lolitas also used to use [[Livejournal]] to communicate, but many have switched to [[Facebook]] groups in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_theses/87/ Chancy J. Gatlin (2014) ''The Fashion of Frill: The Art of Impression Management in the Atlanta Lolita and Japanese Street Fashion Community'', Georgia State University, United States of America, pp. 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Confusions ==
Lolita fashion did not emerge until after the publication of the novel ''[[Lolita]]'' (1955),&lt;ref name="Young Kang &amp; T. Diane Cassidy (2015) pp. 371-384."/&gt;&lt;ref name="M.

Christopherson (2014) ''The Power of Cute: Redefining Kawaii Culture As a Feminst Movement'', Carthage College, United States of America, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; which was written by [[Vladimir Nabokov]], the first translation of the novel in Japanese appearing in 1959.&lt;ref name="ijoc.org"/&gt; The novel is about a physical relationship between a twelve-year-old girl nicknamed Lolita, and a middle-aged man, Humbert Humbert.&lt;ref&gt;http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1333 Perry R.

Gatlin (2014) ''The Fashion of Frill: The Art of Impression Management in the wAtlanta Lolita and Japanese Street Fashion Community'', Georgia State University, United States of America, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the book focused on the controversial subject of pedophilia and underage sexuality, lolita soon developed a [[Pejorative|negative connotation]] referring to a girl inappropriately sexualized at a very young age&lt;ref&gt;http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1333 Perry R. Hinton (2013) "Returning in a Different Fashion:
Culture, Communication, and Changing Representations of Lolita in Japan and the West", ''International Journal of Communication'' 7, 1582–1602, p. 1585.&lt;/ref&gt; and associated with unacceptable sexual obsession.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K. Robinson (2014) ''Empowered Princesses: An Ethnographic Examination of the Practices, Rituals, and Conflicts within Lolita Fashion Communities in the United States'', Georgia State University, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lolita'' was made into a movie in [[Lolita (1962 film)|1962]], which was sexualized and did not show the disinterest that Lolita had in sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1333 Perry R. Hinton (2013) "Returning in a Different Fashion: Culture, Communication, and Changing Representations of Lolita in Japan and the West", ''International Journal of Communication'' 7, 1582–1602, pp. 1584–1585.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/05/25/lolita-fashion/|title=Lolita Fashion|publisher=''The Paris Review''|accessdate=6 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806085224/https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/05/25/lolita-fashion/ |archivedate=6 August 2017|date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A remake was made in [[Lolita (1997 film)|1997]]. The 17 year old [[Amy Fisher]], who attempted to murder the wife of her 35-year-old lover and whose crime was made into a film called ''[[The Amy Fisher Story]]'' (1993), was often called the Long Island Lolita. These mentioned media reinforced the sexual association&lt;ref&gt;http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1333 Perry R.

Monden (2008) "Transcultural Flow of Demure Aesthetics: Examining Cultural Globalisation through Gothic &amp; Lolita Fashion", The Japan Foundation Sydney, ''New Voices'' Volume 2, 21–40, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor is that Western culture considers wearing cute clothing when adult to be childish, associating lolita with paedophile fantasies. In contrast, it is more acceptable for cuteness to be part of fashion in Japan.&lt;ref name="M. Monden 2008 p. 34"/&gt;

The [[Lolita complex]] (also known as Lolicon) in writing about Lolita in sexual context,.&lt;ref&gt;http://repository.wellesley.edu/thesiscollection/391/ K. Coombes (2016) Consuming Hello Kitty: Saccharide Cuteness in Japanese Society, Wellesley College, United States of America, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1333 Perry R. Hinton (2013) Returning in a Different Fashion: Culture, Communication, and Changing Representations of Lolita in Japan and the West, International Journal of enCommunication 7, 1582–1602, p. 1593.&lt;/ref&gt; was a term used by [[Russell Trainer|Russel Trainer]] in his novel'' The Lolita Complex'' (1966)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fyeahlolita.blogspot.be/2013/11/why-is-lolita-called-lolita-does-lolita.html|title=''Why is Lolita called "Lolita"?

Coombes (2016) p. 36"/&gt; and refers to paedophile desires.&lt;ref name="K. Coombes (2016) p. 36"/&gt; This expression of the Lolita complex can be found back in the nineties when school uniforms became a central object of desire&lt;ref name="Sharon Kinsella 2002"&gt;https://dx.doi.org/10.2752/136270402778869046 Sharon Kinsella (2002) What's Behind the Fetishism of Japanese School Uniforms?, Fashion Theory, 6:2, 215-237.&lt;/ref&gt; and young girls were pictured as sexual in [[manga]].&lt;ref name="Sharon Kinsella 2002"/&gt;

Within Japanese culture the name refers to cuteness and elegance rather than to sexual attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;http://nccur.lib.nccu.edu.tw/handle/140.119/79821 A. Peirson-Smith (2015) Hey sister, can I borrow your style?: a study of the trans-cultural, trans-textual flows of the Gothic Lolita trend in Asia and beyond, City University of Hong Kong, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://dx.doi.org/10.4236/aasoci.2012.24038 A.

Tidwell (2010) Street and Youth Fashion in Japan, In J.E. Vollmer (Eds.), Berg Encyclopedia of World Dress and Fashion: East Asia, Oxford: Berg Publishers, 398–403.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another confusion that often occurs is between the Lolita fashion style and [[cosplay]]. Although both spread from Japan, they are different and should be perceived as independent from each other;&lt;ref&gt;http://eprints.utas.edu.au/15944/ S. Abigail Staite (2012) Lolita: Atemporal Class-Play With tea and cakes, University of Tasmania, Australia, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; one is a fashion style while the other is role-play, with clothing and accessory being used to play a character. This does not exclude that there may be some overlap between members of both groups.&lt;ref&gt;''De opkomst van de mangacultuur in België. Een subcultuuronderzoek.'', Lora-Elly Vannieuwenhuysen, p. 48, KU Leuven, 2014-2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen at [[anime conventions]] such as the convention in Götenborg in which cosplay and Japanese fashion is mixed.&lt;ref&gt;http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:su:diva-62778 K. Mikami (2011) Cultural Globalization in People's Life Experiences: Japanese Popular Cultural Styles in Sweden, Stockholm University, p. 5-12.&lt;/ref&gt; For some Lolitas, it is insulting if people label their outfit as a costume.&lt;ref name="Y.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22072">{{Muhammad}}

During the [[Early Middle Ages]], [[Christendom]] largely viewed [[Islam]] as a [[list of Christian heresies|Christological heresy]] and [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] as a [[false prophet]]. By the [[Late Middle Ages]], Islam was more typically grouped with [[Paganism|heathenism]], and [[Muhammad]] was viewed as inspired by the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]]. A more relaxed or benign view of Islam only developed in the modern period, after the Islamic empires ceased to be an acute military threat to Europe.  See [[Orientalism]].

The earliest documented Christian knowledge of Muhammad stems from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] sources, written shortly after Muhammad's death in 632. With the [[Crusades]] of the [[High Middle Ages]], and the wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Late Middle Ages]], the Christian reception of Muhammad became more [[polemic]]al, moving from the classification as a heretic to depiction of Muhammad as a servant of [[Satan]] or as the [[Antichrist]], who will be suffering tortures in [[Christian views on hell|Hell]].

== Overview ==
{{Main|Criticism of Muhammad#Christian criticism|Muhammad in the Bible#Muhammad as Antichrist}}
In contrast to the views of [[Muhammad in Islam]], the Christian image stayed highly negative for over a millennium.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;"Muhammad." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 10 January 2007, [http://search.eb.com/eb/article-251806 eb.com article].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[John Esposito|Esposito, John]] | year=1998 | title=Islam: The Straight Path | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-511233-4}} p.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt, W.

=== Early Middle Ages ===
The earliest written Christian knowledge of Muhammad stems from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] sources, written shortly after Muhammad's death in 632. In the anti-Jewish polemic the ''[[Teaching of Jacob]]'', a dialogue between a recent Christian convert and several [[Jews]], one participant writes that his brother "wrote to [him] saying that a deceiving prophet has appeared amidst the [[Saracen]]s". Another participant in the ''Doctrina'' replies about Muhammad: "He is deceiving. For do prophets come with sword and [[chariot]]?, …[Y]ou will discover nothing true from the said prophet except human bloodshed".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Emil Kaegi, Jr., "Initial Byzantine Reactions to the Arab Conquest", ''[[Church History (journal)|Church History]]'', Vol. 38, No. 2 (June , 1969), p. 139–149, p. 139–142, quoting from ''Doctrina Jacobi nuper baptizati'' 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; Though Muhammad is never called by his name,&lt;ref&gt;''Mahomet'', among other [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] forms (such as [[Mahound]]), were popular for rendering of the Arabic name Muhammad, borne by the founder of the religion of Islam (died 633). In literary use now superseded by the more correct form Mohammed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[New English Dictionary on Historical Principles]]'', Volume 6. By [[Philological Society|Philological Society (Great Britain)]]. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=iakjAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA38 38]&lt;/ref&gt; there seems to have been knowledge of his existence. It also appears that both [[Judaism's views on Muhammad|Jews]] and Christians viewed him in a negative light.&lt;ref&gt;Kaegi p. 139–149, p. 139–142&lt;/ref&gt; Other contemporary sources, such as the writings of [[Sophronius of Jerusalem]], show there was no knowledge of the Saracens having their own prophet or faith, and only remark that the Saracen attacks must be a punishment for Christian [[sin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kaegi p. 139–149, p. 139–141,&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge of Muhammad was available in [[Christendom]] from after the early expansion of his religion&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Stubbe]] ''An account of the rise and progress of Mahometanism'' Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG1AAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA211 211]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Christian Thought''. Edited by Adrian Hastings, Alistair Mason, Hugh Pyper. Pg 330.&lt;/ref&gt; and, later, the translation of a polemical work by [[John of Damascus]], who used the phrase "[[false prophet]] in "Heresies in Epitome: How They Began and Whence They Drew Their Origin.".&lt;ref&gt;http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/stjohn_islam.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Source: "The Fountain of Wisdom" (''pege gnoseos''), part II: "Concerning Heresy" (''peri aipeseon'')&lt;/ref&gt;   According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' Christian knowledge of Muhammad's life "was nearly always used abusively".&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Another influential source was the [[Epistolae Saraceni]] or the “Letters of a Saracen” written by an Oriental Christian and translated into Latin from Arabic.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; From the 9th century onwards, highly negative biographies of Muhammad were written in Latin,&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; such as the one by [[Álvaro of Córdoba (Mozarab)|Álvaro of Córdoba ]] proclaiming him the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref name="meyer2"/&gt;  Christendom also gained some knowledge of Muhammad through the [[Mozarabs]] of Spain, such as the 9th-century [[Eulogius of Córdoba]],&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; who was one of the [[Martyrs of Córdoba]].

=== High Middle Ages ===
{{see|Vita Mahumeti}}
[[File:Mohammed2.jpg|Mohammed and the Murdered Monk|thumb|left|250px|"Mohammed and the Murdered Monk", 1508 engraving by [[Lucas van Leyden]] – an incident unattested in Islamic accounts of the Prophet's life]]
In the 11th century [[Petrus Alphonsi]], a Jew who converted to Christianity, was another Mozarab source of information on Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Later during the 12th century [[Peter the Venerable]], who saw Muhammad as the precursor to the Antichrist and the successor of [[Arius]],&lt;ref name="meyer2"/&gt; ordered the translation of the [[Quran]] into Latin (''[[Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete]]'') and the collection of information on Muhammad so that Islamic teachings could be refuted by Christian scholars.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

During the 13th century European biographers completed their work on the life of Muhammad in a series of works by scholars such as [[Peter Pascual]], [[Riccoldo da Monte di Croce]], and [[Ramon Llull]]&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; in which Muhammad was depicted as an Antichrist while [[Islam]] was shown to be a Christian [[heresy]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; The fact that Muhammad was unlettered, that he married a wealthy widow, that in his later life he had several wives, that he was involved in several wars, and that he died like an ordinary person in contrast to the Christian belief in the supernatural end of [[Jesus]]' earthly life were all arguments used to discredit Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

Medieval scholars and churchmen held that Islam was the work of Muhammad who in turn was inspired by Satan. [[Kenneth Setton]] wrote that Muhammad was frequently calumniated and made a subject of legends taught by preachers as fact.&lt;ref name="meyer1"&gt;Kenneth Meyer Setton (July 1, 1992). "[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0871692015&amp;id=hk4LAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage Western Hostility to Islam and Prophecies of Turkish Doom]". Diane Publishing. {{ISBN|0-87169-201-5}}. pg 1–5&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in order to show that Muhammad was the anti-Christ, it was asserted that Muhammad died not in the year 632 but in the year 666 – the [[number of the beast]] – in another variation on the theme the number "666" was also used to represent the period of time Muslims would hold sway of the land.&lt;ref name="meyer2"/&gt; A verbal expression of Christian contempt for Islam was expressed in turning his name from Muhammad to [[Mahound]], the "devil incarnate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Reeves, Minou | title=Muhammad in Europe: A Thousand Years of Western Myth-Making | year=2003 | publisher=NYU Press | isbn=978-0-8147-7564-6}}, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Others usually confirmed to pious Christians that Muhammad had come to a bad end.&lt;ref name="meyer1"/&gt; According to one version after falling into a drunken stupor he had been eaten by a herd of swine, and this was ascribed as the reason why Muslims proscribed consumption of alcohol and pork.&lt;ref name="meyer1"/&gt; In another account of the alcohol ban, Muhammad learns about the Bible from a Jew and a heretical [[Arianism|Arian]] monk. Muhammad and the monk get drunk and fall asleep. The Jew kills the monk with Muhammad's sword. He then blames Muhammad, who, believing he has committed the crime in a drunken rage, bans alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Bushkovich, Paul, "Orthodoxy and Islam in Russia", Steindorff, L. (ed) ''Religion und Integration im Moskauer Russland: Konzepte und Praktiken, Potentiale und Grenzen 14.-17. Jahrhundert'', Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2010, p.128.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Leggenda di Maometto'' is another example of such a story. In this version, as a child Muhammad was taught the black arts by a heretical Christian villain who escaped imprisonment by the [[Christian Church]] by fleeing to the [[Arabian Peninsula]]; as an adult he set up a false religion by selectively choosing and perverting texts from the [[Bible]] to create Islam. It also ascribed the Muslim holiday of Friday "dies Veneris" (day of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]), as against the Jewish (Saturday) and the Christian (Sunday), to his followers' depravity as reflected in their multiplicity of wives.&lt;ref name="meyer1"/&gt; A highly negative depiction of Muhammad as a heretic, false prophet, renegade cardinal or founder of a violent religion also found its way into many other works of European literature, such as the [[chansons de geste]], [[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', and [[John Lydgate]]'s ''The Fall of the Princes''.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;
[[File:Dante and Virgil Meet Muhammad and His Son-in-law, Ali in Hell.jpg|thumb|right|Muhammad pulling his chest open in [[William Blake]]'s illustration of [[Dante Alighieri]]'s "[[Divine Comedy]]"]]

The thirteenth century ''[[Golden Legend]]'', a best-seller in its day containing a collection of hagiographies, describes "Magumeth (Mahomet, Muhammad)" as "a false prophet and sorcerer", detailing his early life and travels as a merchant through his marriage to the widow, Khadija and goes on to suggest his "visions" came as a result of epileptic seizures and the interventions of a renegade [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] monk named Sergius.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=GNWZgIL5ZCoC&amp;pg=PA753&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Divine Comedy====
In  [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'',  Muhammad is in the ninth ditch of [[Malebolge]], the eighth realm, designed for those who have caused schism; specifically, he was placed among the Sowers of Religious Discord.  Muhammad is portrayed as split in half, with his entrails hanging out, representing his status as a [[heresiarch]] (Canto 28):
:No barrel, not even one where the hoops and staves go every which way, was ever split open like one frayed Sinner I saw, ripped from chin to where we fart&lt;!-- this is the actual quotation; do not remove--&gt; below.
:His guts hung between his legs and displayed His vital organs, including that wretched sack Which converts to shit&lt;!-- this is the actual quotation; do not remove --&gt; whatever gets conveyed down the gullet.
:As I stared at him he looked back And with his hands pulled his chest open, Saying, ''"See how I split open the crack in myself! See how twisted and broken Mohammed is! Before me walks [[Ali]], his face Cleft from chin to crown, grief–stricken."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Seth Zimmerman|title=The Inferno of Dante Alighieri |page=191 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3hWDEjN7JcC&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2003 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=0-595-28090-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mohameddemons2.jpg|thumb|right|Mohammed tortured in Hell from fresco in [[San Petronio Basilica]]]]
This scene is frequently shown in illustrations of the ''Divine Comedy''. Muhammad is represented in a 15th-century [[fresco]] ''[[Last Judgment]]'' by Giovanni da Modena and drawing on Dante, in the [[San Petronio Basilica]] in [[Bologna]],&lt;ref name=fresco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,11711,742914,00.html|title=Al-Qaida plot to blow up Bologna church fresco|date=2002-06-24|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Philip Willan}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in artwork by [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[William Blake]], and [[Gustave Doré]].&lt;ref name=Chronicle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/02/11/MNGRCH6UQK1.DTL|title=What's behind Muslim cartoon outrage|date=2006-02-11|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Ayesha Akram}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common allegation laid against Muhammad was that he was an impostor who, in order to satisfy his ambition and his lust, propagated religious teachings that he knew to be false.&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;Watt, Montgomery, ''Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman.'' Oxford University Press, 1961. From p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural critic]] and author [[Edward Said]] wrote in ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' regarding Dante's depiction of Muhammad:
{{quote|Empirical data about the Orient […] count for very little [i.e., in Dante's work]; what matters and is decisive is […] by no means confined to the professional scholar, but rather the common possession of all who have thought about the Orient in the West […]. What […] Dante tried to do in the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', is […] to characterize the Orient as alien and to incorporate it schematically on a theatrical stage whose audience, manager, and actors are […] only for Europe. Hence the vacillation between the familiar and the alien; Mohammed is always the imposter (familiar, because he pretends to be like the Jesus we know) and always the Oriental (alien, because although he is in some ways "like" Jesus, he is after all not like him).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Said|first=Edward|authorlink=Edward Said|title=Orientalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zvJ3YwOkZAYC|year=1979|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-394-74067-6|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
A more positive interpretation appears in the 13th-century ''Estoire del Saint Grail'', the first book in the vast [[Matter of Britain]], the [[Lancelot-Grail]]. In describing the travels of [[Joseph of Arimathea]], keeper of the [[Holy Grail]], the author says that most residents of the Middle East were pagans until the coming of Muhammad, who is shown as a true [[prophet]] sent by God to bring Christianity to the region. This mission however failed when Muhammad's pride caused him to alter God's wishes, thereby deceiving his followers. Nevertheless, Muhammad's religion is portrayed as being greatly superior to paganism.&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, Norris J. (Ed.) (December 1, 1992). ''Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation,'' Volume 1 of 5. New York: Garland. {{ISBN|0-8240-7733-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Later presentations====
The depiction of Islam in the ''Travels of Sir [[John Mandeville]]'' is also relatively positive, though with many inaccurate and mythical features. It is said that Muslims are easily converted to Christianity because their beliefs are already so similar in many ways, and that they believe that only the Christian revelation will last until the end of the world. The moral behaviour of Muslims at the time is shown as superior to that of Christians, and as a standing reproach to Christian society.&lt;ref name="travel"&gt;[http://www.romanization.com/books/mandeville/chap15.html The Travels of Sir John Mandeville], CHAPTER XV.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of Muhammad in the form of [[picaresque novel]]  began to appear from the 13th century onward, such as in Alexandre du Pont's ''Roman de Mahom'', the translation of the Mi'raj, the ''Escala de Mahoma'' (“The Ladder of Muhammad”) by the court physician of Alfonso X of Castile and León and his son.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

Medieval European literature often referred to Muslims as "[[infidel]]s" or "pagans", in sobriquets such as the ''paynim foe''. These depictions such as those in ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' represent Muslims worshiping Muhammad (spelt e.g. 'Mahom' and 'Mahumet') as a god, and depict them worshiping various deities in the form of "[[cult image|idols]]", ranging from [[Abaddon|Apollyon]] to [[Lucifer]], but ascribing to them a chief deity known as "[[Termagant]]".&lt;ref name="meyer2"&gt;Kenneth Meyer Setton (July 1, 1992). "[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0871692015&amp;id=hk4LAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage Western Hostility to Islam and Prophecies of Turkish Doom]". Diane Publishing. {{ISBN|0-87169-201-5}}. pg 4-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'', "[http://www.bartleby.com/81/16352.html Termagant]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, in medieval romances such as the French Arthurian cycle, pagans such as the ancient Britons or the inhabitants of "Sarras" before the conversion of King Evelake, who presumably lived well before the birth of Muhammad, are often described as worshipping the same array of gods and as identical to the imagined (Termagant-worshipping) Muslims in every respect. In the same vein, the definition of "[[Saracen]]" in [[Raymond of Penyafort]]'s ''Summa de Poenitentia'' starts by describing the Muslims but ends by including every person who is neither a Christian nor a Jew.

When the [[Knights Templar]] were being tried for [[heresy]] reference was often made to their worship of a demon [[Baphomet]], which was notable by implication for its similarity to the common rendition of Muhammad's name used by Christian writers of the time, Mahomet.&lt;ref&gt;''Mahomet'' still is the Polish and French word for the English "Muhammad".&lt;/ref&gt; All these and other variations on the theme were all set in the "temper of the times" of what was seen as a Muslim-Christian conflict as Medieval Europe was building a concept of "the great enemy" in the wake of the quickfire success of the [[early Muslim conquests]] shortly after the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], as well as the lack of real information in the West of the mysterious East.&lt;ref name="Watt"/&gt;

Muhammad is characterized as "''pseudo-prophet''" in Byzantine and post-Byzantine religious and historic texts, as for example by [[Niketas Choniates]] (12th-13th c.).&lt;ref name="Mai1840"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mai|first=Angelo|authorlink=Angelo Mai|title=Spicilegium romanum ...: Patrum ecclesiasticorum Serapionis, Ioh.

In [[visual art]], '''mixed media''' is an [[work of art|artwork]] in which more than one [[Art medium|medium]] or material has been employed.
Assemblages and collages are two common examples of art using different medias that will make use of different materials including [[cloth]], [[paper]], and/or [[wood]]. &lt;ref name="assemblages and collages"&gt; [https://keeleybassett.wordpress.com/2016/11/16/what-is-the-difference-between-collage-montage-and-assemblage/]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
When an artist is doing painting or photography work using mixed media, care should be taken to allow enough drying time between layers, to ensure the final work will have structural integrity. If several different mixed medias are used with the artwork, it is important to choose a sturdy foundation upon which the different media layers are imposed. 

Many artistic effects can be achieved by using mixed media. [[Found objects]] can be used in conjunction with traditional artist media to attain a wide range of self-expression. 

Some children's picture books also use mixed media illustrations. For example, [['s Nachts]] by  [[Wolf Erlbruch]].

Mixed media art, a visual art, is distinguished from [[Multimedia|multimedia art]] which combines visual art with non-visual elements, such as recorded sound, literature, drama, dance, motion graphics, music, or interactivity.

The '''National Book Foundation''' (NBF) is an American [[nonprofit organization]] established "to raise the cultural appreciation of great writing in America". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/magazine/lisa-lucas-wants-to-make-reading-fun-again.html|title=Lisa Lucas Wants to Make Reading Fun Again|author=|date=7 September 2016|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established 1989 by National Book Awards, Inc.,&lt;ref name=nyt1989&gt;Edwin McDowell. "Book Notes: 'The Joy Luck Club' is to be in paperback&amp;nbsp;... The National Book Awards' new foundation". ''The New York Times'', July 5, 1989, page C19.&lt;/ref&gt;
the foundation is the administrator and sponsor of the [[National Book Award]]s, a changing set of [[literary awards]] inaugurated 1936 and continuous from 1950. It also organizes and sponsors public and educational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/features/la-ca-jc-lisa-lucas-20160509-snap-story.html|title=Lisa Lucas, head of the National Book Foundation, wants you to love reading|first=Carolyn|last=Kellogg|date=|website=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Book Foundation's Board of Directors comprises representatives of American literary institutions and the book industry. For example, in 2009 the Board included the President of the [[New York Public Library]], the Chief Merchandising Officer of [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], the President/Publisher of [[Grove/Atlantic, Inc.]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/70585-national-book-foundation-names-two-new-board-members.html|title=National Book Foundation Names Two New Board Members|author=|date=|website=publishersweekly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Lisa Lucas became the Foundation's third Executive Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/lisa-lucas-named-executive-director-of-national-book-foundation/?_r=0|title=Lisa Lucas Named Executive Director of National Book Foundation|last=Williams|first=John|website=ArtsBeat|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Book Foundation states the mission "to celebrate the best of American literature, to expand its audience, and to enhance the cultural value of great writing in America."

==Awards==
The original task of the National Book Foundation was to award the National Book Award. The Award was given without the foundation from 1950 until it was replaced with The American Book Awards in 1980, with 16 different categories.  In 1987, the National Book Award was reestablished. The award split into 4 categories in 1996: Fiction, Nonfiction, Poetry, and Young People's Literature. The winner in each category is decided by an independent panel of writers, librarians, booksellers, and critics.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Neary. [https://www.npr.org/2013/09/16/223132417/national-book-awards-look-to-raise-profile-and-its-not-the-first-time "National Book Awards Look to Raise Profile"]. ''NPR books''. September 16, 2013. [[National Public Radio]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to four National Book Awards to authors for particular books, the Foundation presents two lifetime achievement awards: the [[National Book Award#Medal for Distinguished Contribution (lifetime)|Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters]] and the [[National Book Award#Literarian Award for Outstanding Service (lifetime)|Literarian Award for Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://michaelcavacini.com/2015/11/19/james-patterson-honored-at-national-book-awards/|title=James Patterson Honored At National Book Awards|date=2015-11-19|website=Michael Cavacini|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigstory.ap.org/article/44096ee4eb0b419cb1859594e6d3cd5c/robert-caro-receive-honorary-national-book-award-medal|title=Robert Caro to receive honorary National Book Award medal|author=|date=|website=ap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation annually awards the [[Innovations in Reading Prize]] ($10,000) to "individuals and institutions—or partnerships between the two—that have developed innovative means of creating and sustaining a lifelong love of reading."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferbaker/2016/02/14/national-book-foundation-celebrates-innovators-of-reading/#55bb11a37e30|title=National Book Foundation Celebrates Innovators Of Reading Encouraging Philanthropy For More Literacy|last=Baker|first=Jennifer|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

===Book Up===
Book Up is an after school program for middle school students to foster a lifelong love of reading. The program is designed in a way meant to show kids how enjoyable reading can be, and to improve their confidence in their reading abilities. Middle School students are chosen as studies have shown that this is the age that students are the most likely to stop reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electricliterature.com/infographic-national-book-foundations-bookup-helps-foster-a-lifelong-love-of-reading-f2b330bf0842|title=INFOGRAPHIC: National Book Foundation’s BookUp Helps Foster a Lifelong Love of Reading|author=|date=17 March 2015|website=electricliterature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Program is typically run by authors with experience in teaching. Sessions last for at least 24 weeks, over which students share their reading interests and previous experiences with reading. Since BookUp began, the program has given out more than 30,000 free books to students. The program started in 2007 in New York City and has expanded to Hunstville, TX, Detroit, MI, and created BookUp LGBTQ for LGBTQ youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lambdaliterary.org/features/news/01/30/bookup-lgbtq-launches-at-the-hetrick-martin-institute/|title=BookUp LGBTQ Launches at the Hetrick-Martin Institute|date=2016-01-30|website=Lambda Literary|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===5 Under 35===
The 5 Under 35 program was started in 2005 in order to honor 5 young writers, all under the age of 35. The winners are all chosen by previous Finalists of the National Book Award. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-5-under-35-20160908-snap-story.html|title=Meet the National Book Foundation's 5 Under 35|first=Michael|last=Schaub|date=|website=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2015, the winners were chosen by previous 5 Under 35 honorees. Each award comes with a cash prize of $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jarrylee/5-under-35|title=Here Are The 2015 National Book Foundation 5 Under 35 Honorees|website=BuzzFeed|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5 Under 35 Ceremony has been hosted by [[Questlove]], [[Carrie Brownstein]], [[LeVar Burton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flavorwire.com/540285/national-book-foundation-reveals-their-5-under-35-honorees|title=The National Book Foundation Reveals Its "5 Under 35" Honorees|date=2015-09-30|website=Flavorwire|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

=== Teen Press Conference ===
The Teen Press Conference invites middle and high school students in New York City to interview the five Young People's Literature Finalists the day before the National Book Awards. Students are provided copies of the Finalists' books. In 2015, the Teen Press Conference took place at the [[92nd Street Y]] with host [[Jacqueline Woodson]], a National Book Award Winner, as well as in Miami as part of the Miami Book Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://miamibookfair.com/event/national-book-foundation-presents-the-teen-press-conference/|title=Upcoming Events – National Book Foundation presents the Teen Press Conference – Miami Book Fair|website=miamibookfair.com|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Book Awards on Campus ===
National Book Awards on Campus is a program that brings National Book Award winners and finalists to college campuses. In 2015, for its 11th season, NBA on Campus  took place at [[Sam Houston State University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shsu.edu/academics/english/creative-writing/national-book-awards/|title=National Book Awards Festival|first=Sam Houston State|last=University|date=|website=SHSU Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Concordia College (Moorhead, Minnesota)|Concordia College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.concordiacollege.edu/academics/events/national-book-awards-at-concordia/nba-history/|title=NBA History|author=|date=|website=Concordia College}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amherst College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amherst.edu/arts/the-common/national-book-awards-week|title=The Common Literary Magazine - National Book Awards on Campus - Amherst College|author=|date=|website=www.amherst.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Rollins College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://360.rollins.edu/arts-and-culture/rollins-college-partners-with-the-national-book-awards|title=Rollins College Partners with the National Book Awards - Arts &amp; Culture - Rollins College 360 News|author=|date=|website=360.rollins.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personal imaging''' is the continuous [[real time (media)|realtime]] capturing, archiving, recording,
and sharing of personal [[experience]] through [[image]]s. Typically the images are accompanied by other media such as [[sound reproduction|audio]]visual streams, or with [[writing|text]]ual narratives such as [[diary|diaries]], and often in an interactive way, i.e. people viewing the images comment on the images in realtime while they are being captured, so as to influence the capture process.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

'''Phan Thị Kim Phúc''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|OOnt}} ({{IPA-vi|faːŋ tʰɪ̂ˀ kim fúk͡p̚}}; born April 2, 1963), referenced informally as the ''' Napalm girl''', is a [[South Vietnam]]ese-born Canadian best known as the nine-year-old child depicted in the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning photograph taken at [[Trảng Bàng]] during the [[Vietnam War]] on June 8, 1972. The well-known photo, by AP photographer [[Nick Ut]], shows her at nine years of age running naked on a road after being severely burned on her back by a South Vietnamese [[napalm]] attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Girl, 9, Survives Napalm Burns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/11/archives/girl-9-survives-napalm-burns.html | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=17 |date=June 11, 1972 |accessdate=August 18, 2014 |quote=Nine-year-old Phan Thi Kim-Phuc is recuperating in a Saigon children's hospital, the unintended victim of a misdirected napalm attack....}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Kim Phúc and her family were residents of the village of [[Trảng Bàng]] in [[South Vietnam]]. On June 8, 1972, [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force|South Vietnamese planes]] dropped a [[napalm]] bomb on Trảng Bàng, which had been attacked and occupied by [[Vietnam People's Army|North Vietnamese forces]].&lt;ref name=boston/&gt; Kim Phúc joined a group of civilians and [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnamese soldiers]] who were fleeing from the [[Caodai]] Temple to the safety of South Vietnamese-held positions. [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force|The Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] pilot mistook the group for enemy soldiers and diverted to attack. The bombing killed two of Kim Phúc's cousins and two other villagers. Kim Phúc received third degree burns after her clothing was burned by the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Nick|title=Vietnam War 'girl in the picture' reunited with journalist who saved her life|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/vietnam/7735854/Vietnam-War-girl-in-the-picture-reunited-with-journalist-who-saved-her-life.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Associated Press]] photographer [[Nick Ut]]'s photograph of Kim Phúc running naked amid other fleeing villagers, South Vietnamese soldiers and press photographers became one of the most haunting images of the [[Vietnam War]]. In an interview many years later, she recalled she was yelling, ''Nóng quá, nóng quá'' ("too hot, too hot") in the picture. ''The New York Times'' editors were at first hesitant to consider the photo for publication because of the nudity, but eventually approved it. A cropped version of the photo—with the press photographers to the right removed—was featured on the front page of ''The New York Times'' the next day. It later earned a [[Pulitzer Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 1973 Pulitzer Prize Winner in Spot News Photography: Huynh Cong Ut of Associated Press |publisher=The Pulitzer Prizes |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/huynh-cong-ut}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was chosen as the [[World Press Photo of the Year]] for 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Press Photo of the Year, prize singles: Nick Ut, USA |publisher=World Press Photo |url=http://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/1973/world-press-photo-year/nick-ut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After snapping the photograph, Ut took Kim Phúc and the other injured children to Barsky Hospital in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]], where it was determined that her burns were so severe that she probably would not survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kimfoundation.com/modules/contentpage/index.php?file=story.htm&amp;ma=10&amp;subid=101 |title=History |publisher=Kim Phúc Foundation International |accessdate=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a 14-month hospital stay and 17 surgical procedures including [[Skin grafting|skin transplantations]], she was able to return home. A number of the early operations were performed by [[Finland|Finnish]] [[plastic surgeon]] [[Aarne Rintala]] (1926–2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Audio tapes of President [[Richard Nixon]], in conversation with his chief of staff, [[H. R. Haldeman]] in 1972, reveal that Nixon mused "I'm wondering if that was fixed" after seeing the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/02/28/politics/main502490.shtml | publisher=CBS News | title=Nixon, The A-Bomb, And Napalm | date=February 28, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the release of this tape, Ut commented, "Even though it has become one of the most memorable images of the twentieth century, President Nixon once doubted the authenticity of my photograph when he saw it in the papers on 12 June 1972.... The picture for me and unquestionably for many others could not have been more real. The photo was as authentic as the Vietnam War itself. The horror of the Vietnam War recorded by me did not have to be fixed. That terrified little girl is still alive today and has become an eloquent testimony to the authenticity of that photo. That moment thirty years ago will be one Kim Phúc and I will never forget. It has ultimately changed both our lives."&lt;ref&gt;from program booklet for Humanist Art/Symbolic Sites: An Art Forum for the 21st century&lt;/ref&gt;

Phúc was removed from her university as a young adult studying medicine and used as a propaganda symbol by the communist government of Vietnam. {{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 1986, however, she was granted permission to continue her studies in [[Cuba]]. Prime Minister of Vietnam [[Phạm Văn Đồng]] became her friend and patron.  After arriving in Cuba, she met Bui Huy Toan, another Vietnamese student and her future fiancé.  In 1992, Phúc and Toan married. On the way to their honeymoon in Moscow, they left the plane during a refuelling stop in [[Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador |Gander]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], and asked for [[Right of asylum |political asylum]] in Canada, which was granted.

In 2004, Phúc spoke at the [[University of Connecticut]] about her life and experience, learning how to be "strong in the face of pain" and how compassion and love helped her heal.&lt;ref&gt;Omara-Otunnu, Elizabeth, [http://www.advance.uconn.edu/2004/041108/04110803.htm "Napalm Survivor Tells of Healing After Vietnam War"], ''UConn Advance'', November 8, 2004.

==Recognition==
In 1996, Kim Phúc gave a speech at the United States [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] on [[Veterans Day]].  In her speech, she said that one cannot change the past, but everyone can work together for a peaceful future. Rev. John Plummer, a [[Vietnam veteran]], who believed he took part in coordinating the air strike with the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (though Plummer's entire chain of command and declassified documents indicate otherwise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ndqsa.com/myth.html |title=The Fraud Behind The Girl in the Photo |publisher=NDQSA |accessdate= June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) met with Phúc briefly and was publicly forgiven.

On November 10, 1994, Kim Phúc was named a [[UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador]]. Her biography, ''The Girl in the Picture'', was written by [[Denise Chong]] and published in 1999.  In 2003, Belgian composer Eric Geurts wrote "The Girl in the Picture," dedicated to Kim Phúc. It was released on Flying Snowman Records, with all profits going to the [[Kim Phúc Foundation]]. On October 22, 2004, Kim Phúc was made a member of the [[Order of Ontario]], and received an [[Honorary degree |honorary Doctorate of Law]] from [[York University]] for her work to support child victims of war around the world. On October 27, 2005, she was awarded an honorary degree in Law from [[Queen's University]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Honorary Degrees – Fall Convocation 2005 |publisher=[[Queen's University]] |url= http://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/senate/Sep22_05/HDfall05.pdf |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110606142002/http://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/senate/Sep22_05/HDfall05.pdf |archivedate=June 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 2, 2011, she was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the [[University of Lethbridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.uleth.ca/conreg/chancellorsdinner/ceremony-i |title= Chancellor’s dinner |publisher= ULeth |accessdate= June 6, 2012}}{{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;!-- not at archive.org --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On May 19, 2016, she was awarded a Doctor of Civil Law, Honoris Causa by [[Saint Mary's University (Halifax)]].

==''The Girl in the Picture''==
''The Girl in the Picture: The Kim Phúc Story, the Photograph and the Vietnam War'' by [[Denise Chong]] is a 1999 biographical and historical work tracing the life story of Kim Phúc. Chong's historical coverage emphasizes the life, especially the school and family life, of Kim Phúc from before the attack, through convalescence, and into the present time.

''The Girl in the Picture'' deals primarily with Vietnamese and American relationships during the Vietnam War, while examining themes of war, racism, immigration, political turmoil, repression, poverty, and international relationships through the lens of family and particularly through the eyes and everyday lives of women. Kim Phúc and her mother, Nu, provide the lens through which readers of ''The Girl in the Picture'' experience war, strife, and the development of communism in Vietnam.  Like Chong's first book, ''The Girl in the Picture'' was shortlisted for the [[Governor General's Award |Governor General's Literary Award for non fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =Diana | last = Lary |url= http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/denise-chong/ |title=Denise Chong | work =The Canadian Encyclopedia |date=June 9, 1953 |accessdate=June 6, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110608134423/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0010395 |archivedate=June 8, 2011 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="The Salvation of 'Napalm Girl'"==
In a December 21, 2017, article for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-salvation-of-napalm-girl-1513899109|title=The Salvation of ‘Napalm Girl’|first=Kim Phuc Phan|last=Thi|work=Wall Street Journal|date=December 21, 2017|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim Phúc wrote that the trauma she suffered in the napalm strike still requires treatment, but that the psychological trauma was greater: "But even worse than the physical pain was the emotional and spiritual pain." This led directly to her conversion to Christianity, which she credits with healing the psychological trauma of living over forty years being known to the world as "Napalm Girl". "My faith in Jesus Christ is what has enabled me to forgive those who had wronged me," she wrote, "no matter how severe those wrongs were."

:''This article refers to the [[Sefer (Hebrew)|Torah book]]. For the second [[Rebbe]] of the Sochatchov Hasidic dynasty, see [[Shmuel Bornsztain, second Sochatchover Rebbe|Shmuel Bornsztain]].''
'''''Shem Mishmuel''''' ({{lang-he|שם משמואל}}) is a nine-volume collection of homiletical teachings on the [[Torah]] and [[Jewish holiday]]s delivered by Rabbi [[Shmuel Bornsztain, second Sochatchover Rebbe|Shmuel Bornsztain]], the second [[Sochatchov (Hasidic dynasty)|Sochatchover]] [[Rebbe]], between the years 1910-1926.&lt;ref name="Landau"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/sochaczew/so628.html |last=Landau |first=Jerrold |title=The Admor Rabbi Shmuel of Holy Blessed Memory |date=9 July 2006 |accessdate=12 January 2011 |publisher=jewishgen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major work in Hasidic thought, it synthesizes the Hasidism of [[Pshischa]] and [[Kotzk]] in the style of Sochatchov,&lt;ref name="Landau" /&gt; and is frequently cited in Torah ''[[Shiur (Torah)|shiurim]]'' (lectures) and articles to this day.

Bornsztain became known as the ''Shem Mishmuel'' after the title of this work, which was published posthumously.

==Title ==
The title comes from the [[Mishnah]] on ''[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]]'' 12:3, which describes the [[Activities prohibited on Shabbat|prohibition]] against writing on [[Shabbat]]. The Mishnah teaches that if a [[Jews|Jew]] wishes to write a whole name like Shimon (שמעון) or Shmuel (שמואל), but writes only the first two letters of these names, ''[[Shin (letter)|shin]]'' (ש) and ''[[mem]]'' (מ), he still transgresses the prohibition&amp;mdash;for ''shin'' and ''mem'' spell a shorter name, ''shem'' (שם) (which literally means "name"). Bornsztain's choice of the Mishnaic expression ''shem miShimon o miShmuel'' (''Shem'' from Shimon or from Shmuel) for his title reflects the classical rabbinic [[word play|play on words]] combining a rabbinic teaching with the author's own name.&lt;ref name="Bel"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-fj-sKboVBoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=belovski+shem+mishmuel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9wkuTYuwK8rR4gbRt7DlCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=introduction&amp;f=false  |title=Shem Mishmuel: Selections on the weekly parashah and festivals |last=Belovski |first=Rabbi Zvi |pages=xix-xxi |isbn=1-56871-141-7 |year=1998 |publisher=[[Targum Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and structure==
The first eight volumes of ''Shem Mishmuel'' cover lessons on each of the ''[[parasha|parshiyot]]'' (weekly Torah readings). In traditional Hasidic style, they are not printed according to the sequence of the ''parshiyot'', but in the order in which the Rebbe delivered these lessons to his followers. The ninth volume deals exclusively with the [[Passover]] [[Haggadah]].&lt;ref name="Bel" /&gt;

In addition to displaying a thorough familiarity with [[Talmud]], [[Midrash]], [[Kabbalah]], and other classic Jewish sources, Bornsztain presents many of the ideas of his father, Rabbi [[Avrohom Bornsztain]], the first Sochatchover Rebbe, who was known as the ''Avnei Nezer'' after the title of his major work.&lt;ref name="Bel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.torah.org/learning/hamaayan/5762/tetzaveh.html |title=R' Avraham Bornstein z"l |date=February 2002 |accessdate=12 January 2011 |work=Hamaayan &amp;ndash; The Torah Spring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printing history==
The volume on the Pesach Haggadah was published first by Bornsztain's son and successor, Rabbi [[Dovid Bornsztain]], the third Sochatchover Rebbe, in [[Piotrków Trybunalski|Piotrków]] in 1927. Rabbi Dovid published the rest of the volumes between 1927 and 1932, with funding provided by Rabbi David Parshinowski.&lt;ref name="Bel" /&gt; Bornsztain's other son, Rabbi [[Chanoch Henoch Bornsztain]], who had [[Aliyah|immigrated]] to Israel in 1924&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zhdp9btWGWQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=where+heaven+touches+earth+rossoff&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wlPpTI3LFo74sgbcuvW_Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20burnstein&amp;f=false |title=Where Heaven Touches Earth |last=Rossoff |first=Dovid |year=1998 |isbn=0-87306-879-3 |page=471 |publisher=Guardian Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the fourth Sochatchover Rebbe after Rabbi David's death in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] in 1942,&lt;ref&gt;Growise, Yisroel Alter. ''The Sochatchover Rebbe, Harav Menachem Shlomo Bornstein, zt"l, 40 Years Since His Tragic Passing''. [[Hamodia]] Features, 27 August 2009, pp. C4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; published the second edition of ''Shem Mishmuel'' in [[Jerusalem]] in 1950 with the aid of Rabbi Avraham Parshan, son of Rabbi Parshinowski.&lt;ref name="Bel" /&gt;

Rabbi Parshan also assisted with the publication of a third edition in 1965.&lt;ref name="Bel" /&gt; The third edition of the volume dealing with the Hagaddah included an additional section containing ''chiddushei Torah'' (new Torah thoughts) on the Hagaddah which had been penned by Rabbi Dovid and which had survived the war, entitled ''Chasdei Dovid''.&lt;ref name="hamodia"&gt;''Harav Dovid Bornstein &amp;mdash; The Sochatchover Rebbe''. [[Hamodia]] Features, 11 November 2010, p. C3.&lt;/ref&gt; Other editions followed; the seventh, corrected edition used by Rabbi Zvi Belovski in his [[English language|English]] translation for [[Targum Press]] was published in Israel in 1988 by the Parshan family trust in memory of Rabbi Parshan.&lt;ref name="Bel" /&gt;

The '''Teatro Olimpico''' ("Olympic Theatre") is a theatre in [[Vicenza]], northern [[Italy]], constructed in 1580-1585. The theatre was the final design by the Italian Renaissance architect [[Andrea Palladio]] and was not completed until after his death. The [[trompe-l'œil]] onstage scenery, designed by [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]], to give the appearance of long streets receding to a distant horizon, was installed in 1585 for the very first performance held in the theatre, and is the oldest surviving [[theatrical scenery|stage set]] still in existence.  The full Roman-style ''scaenae frons'' back screen across the stage is made from wood and [[stucco]] imitating marble. It was the home of the '''''Accademia Olimpica''''', which was founded there in 1555.

The Teatro Olimpico is, along with the [[Teatro all'antica]] in [[Sabbioneta]] and the [[Teatro Farnese]] in [[Parma]], one of only three Renaissance theatres remaining in existence. Both these theatres were based, in large measure, on the Teatro Olimpico.  It is still used several times a year.

Since 1994, the Teatro Olimpico, together with other Palladian buildings in and around Vicenza, has been part of  the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] [[City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto]].

===Palladio's vision===
The Teatro Olimpico is the last work by Palladio, and ranks amongst his highest masterworks. The Vicentine architect had returned to his native city in 1579, bringing with him a lifetime of detailed study into all aspects of Roman architecture, and a more detailed understanding of the architecture of classical theatre than any other living person. Palladio had illustrated [[Daniele Barbaro|Daniele Barbaro's]] Italian translation of [[Vitruvius]]' ''[[De architectura]]''; the prints for this edition include floorplans for Roman theatres and an elevation for the ''[[scaenae frons]]'' of Vicenza's ruined Roman theatre, the ''[[Teatro Berga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced in Gino Nogara, ''Cronache degli spettacoli nel Teatro Olimpico di Vicenza dal 1580 al 1970''. Vicenza: Accademia Olimpica, 1972, Plate 6 (following p. 418).&lt;/ref&gt; As well, Palladio's papers include plans for the imagined reconstruction of the ruined Roman theatres in [[Pula|Pola]]&lt;ref&gt;Licisco Magagnato, "The Genesis of the ''Teatro Olimpico''", in ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', Vol XIV (1951), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Verona]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Palladio, a founder of the Olympic Academy (the ''Accademia Olimpica'', created in 1555), had already designed temporary theatre structures at various locations in the city. The most notable of these had been erected some seventeen years previously in the great hall of the [[Basilica Palladiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Licisco Magagnato, "The Genesis of the ''Teatro Olimpico''", in ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', Vol XIV (1951), p. 217. The original documents which record the existence of this temporary theatre are in the records of the Accademia Olimpico at the Biblioteca Beroliana in Vicenza.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1579 the Academy obtained the rights to build a permanent theatre in an old fortress, the ''Castello del Territorio,'' which had been turned into a prison and powder magazine before falling into disuse. Palladio was asked to produce a design, and despite the awkward shape of the old fortress, he decided to use the space to recreate an academic reconstruction of the Roman theatres that he had so closely studied. In order to fit a stage and seating area into the wide, shallow space, it was necessary for Palladio to flatten the semicircular seating area of the Roman theatre into an ellipse.

===Scamozzi takes over===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
Palladio died in August 1580, only six months after construction had started on the theatre. Despite this setback, construction continued, with Palladio's sketches and drawings serving as a guide, and Palladio's son, Silla, taking charge of the project. Soon, the other prominent Vicentine architect, [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]], was called upon to complete the project.

Scamozzi had already stepped in to complete Palladio's other great unfinished project, the villa just east of Vicenza that is today known as [[Villa Capra "La Rotonda"|''La Rotonda'']]. It is a mark of Scamozzi's genius that both these projects are today regarded as being among Palladio's most successfully executed works.

Scamozzi's contributions include the ''Odèo'' and ''Antiodèo'' rooms, as well as the entrance archway which leads from the street, through an old medieval wall into the courtyard of the old fortress.

In order to make the archway fit with its surroundings, and to prepare visitors to the theatre for the transformation from medieval to classical surroundings, Scamozzi built the archway to be the same size and shape as the ''porta reggia'' or triumphal arch at the center of the ''scaenae frons'' or rear wall of the stage. However, the entrance archway was [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] to make it fit with the rough and well-worn wall into which it was being inserted.

However, Scamozzi's most famous and most original contribution to the theatre was his elaborate stage set, with its remarkable [[trompe l'œil]] street views. He not only designed the sets, but also put considerable effort into designing the lighting that permitted the make-believe houses of the stage scenery to be lit from within, completing the illusion that these were real streets.

===Design and construction of the scenery===
Aside from a single sketch of the ''scaenae frons'', Palladio left no plans as to what kind of scenery should be used onstage. His illustration of an idealized Roman scaenae frons for Barbaro's edition of Vitruvius had shown perspective street views similar to those which would later be built in the Teatro Olimpico. But the sketch of the proposed scaenae frons for the Teatro Olimpico shows no such street scenes; the space behind the central archway and the doors to each side is blank.

The simplest explanation for the absence of any street scenes in this drawing is that the Academy had not yet obtained the land on which the scenery would later be built. This land was acquired in 1582, after Scamozzi had taken charge of the project. This made it possible to extend the building (including a special [[apse]]-shaped projection to accommodate the longest and most elaborate of the seven street views). The Academy's petition to the city government for the additional land anticipated that if acquired, the space would be used to create perspective scenery; it explains that the extra land would be used to build a theatre "along the lines laid out by our colleague Palladio, who has designed it to permit perspective views."&lt;ref&gt;Licisco Magagnato, "The Genesis of the ''Teatro Olimpico'', in ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', Vol. XIV (1951), p. 216, 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, Palladio can be given credit for having inspired the remarkable perspectives which are visible to the audience through the central archway of the scaenae frons (also known as the "porta reggia") and also through the smaller side openings. But it is also appropriate to regard Scamozzi as the technical genius behind their remarkably successful execution.

Scamozzi's stage set was the first practical introduction of perspective views into [[History of theatre#Renaissance theatre|Renaissance theatre]].  The scenery consists of seven hallways decorated to create the illusion of looking down the streets of a city from classical antiquity. Ancient [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], was to be the setting for the first play staged in the theatre. A set of seven extraordinarily realistic ''[[trompe-l'œil]]'' false perspectives provide the illusion of long street views, while actually the sets recede only a few meters. The way in which seats in all parts of the theatre were provided with at least one perspective view can be seen by observing the theatre floorplan and following the sight lines of audience members in different parts of the theatre.

{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
The theatre was inaugurated on March 3, 1585, with a production of [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mullin|first=Donald|title=The Development of the Playhouse|date=1970|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California, USA|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the theatre was virtually abandoned after only a few productions. The scenes, which had been created in wood and stucco for ''Oedipus Rex'', and which were meant to represent the streets of Thebes, were never removed: despite bombings and other vicissitudes, they have miraculously preserved into modern times. The original lighting system of glass oil lamps, designed by Scamozzi, heightened the illusion of space, has been used only a few times because of the high cost and the risk of fire. Scamozzi's lighting system was used when, in 1997, the theatre was again employed for a production of ''Oedipus Rex''.

The Teatro Olimpico is still used for plays and musical performances, but audience sizes are limited to 400, for conservation reasons. Performances take place in two theatre seasons{{mdash}}classical plays in the autumn and the festival ''Il Suono dell'Olimpico'' in the spring. It is not equipped with heating or air conditioning, which could damage the delicate wooden structures.

The Theatre has been used as a filming location for films such as ''[[Don Giovanni (1979 film)|Don Giovanni]]'' (1979) and  ''[[Casanova (2005 film)|Casanova]]'' (2005).

==Precursors==
Some authors have incorrectly stated that when the Teatro Olimpico was constructed in 1580-1585, it was the first purpose-built theatre in Europe in over a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;For example: "The Teatro Olimpico certainly was a landmark work. It was the first true theatre built after over a thousand years." Susan Crabtree and Peter Beudert, ''Scenic Art for the Theatre'', p. 241. Also: "[T]he first permanent theatre to be built since antiquity." Dan Cruickshank, ''Sir Banister Fletcher's A History of Architecture'', p. 882.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the theatre was one of a number of new permanent theatres being constructed at the time. Records show that permanent theatres were constructed in Ferrara (1531), Rome (1545), Mantua (1549), Bologna (1550), Siena (1561), and Venice (1565). This last theatre was designed by Palladio himself, for the Compagnia della Calza.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Nikolaus Pevsner]], ''A History of Building Types''. London: Thames and Hudson, 1976, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Over the centuries, the Teatro Olimpico has had many admirers, but relatively few imitators. One critic has observed, "In the history of theatre design, the Teatro Olimpico was a temporary hiatus, for succeeding generations adopted the proscenium arch and painterly stage sets. Palladio's ideas are closer to the spirit of the modern theatre, which favors the relationship of audience to action."&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Constant, ''The Palladio Guide''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton Architectural Press, 1985, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Another notes, "The rigid form of the scenic arrangements of the Teatro Olimpico...precluded any further development," and that the theatre was, in a sense, a prisoner of its creators' emphasis on "considerations of archaeology" and truthfulness to the Roman model.&lt;ref&gt;James Laver, ''Drama--Its Costume and Decor''. London: The Studio Publications, 1951, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The successful completion of Palladio's experiment in reconstructing the ancient model meant that there was no longer any need to pursue the objective of recovering the Roman past; it was now possible to start making innovations, starting with eliminating the rigid and unchangeable scaenae frons and the unchanging perspective views.

The first theatre to draw inspiration from the Teatro Olimpico, and the one in which its influence is the most obvious, is the [[Teatro all'antica]] in Sabbioneta. This theatre, which was designed by Vincenzo Scamozzi, is sometimes also referred to, somewhat confusingly, as the "Teatro Olimpico",&lt;ref&gt;For example, see ''Knopf Guides: Italy''. New York: Knopf, 2006, p. 265, which says, "Sabbioneta's reputation as a "Little Athens" rests particularly on the beautiful Teatro Olimpico, a masterpiece by Vincenzo Scamozzi...."&lt;/ref&gt; and some of its design elements, including most notably the colonnade behind the seating area and the self-conscious references to ancient Rome, are clearly drawn from the original Teatro Olimpico. However, the elaborate scaenae frons is absent in Sabbioneta, and only a single perspective view, along a single street, is employed onstage. As well, the seating area departs radically from Palladio's elliptical plan (perhaps as a result of the much narrower shape of the building in which the theatre is housed).

The English architect [[Inigo Jones]] visited the Teatro Olimpico shortly after its completion, and took careful notes, in which he expressed particular admiration for the perspective views: "[T]he chief artifice was that whear so ever you sat you saw one of thes Prospects...."&lt;ref&gt;Jones is quoted in James Laver, ''Drama--Its Costume and Decor''. London: The Studio Publications, 1951, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, a Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal''''' is a 2009 book by [[Ben Mezrich]] about the founding of [[Facebook]],&lt;ref name=moneycnn&gt;{{cite web|last=Hempel |first=Jessi |url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/06/25/technology/founding_of_facebook.fortune/index.htm |title=The Book that Facebook Doesn't Want You to Read|publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; adapted by [[Columbia Pictures]] for the 2010 film ''[[The Social Network]]''. Co-founder [[Eduardo Saverin]] served as Mezrich's main consultant,&lt;ref name=moneycnn /&gt; although [[Mark Zuckerberg]] declined to speak with him while the book was being researched. After Zuckerberg and Saverin settled their lawsuit, Saverin broke off contact with the author.

== Sources ==
Ben Mezrich maintains that the book is not a work of fiction despite his narrative style of writing. Some of his sources are his conversations with Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin and the court documents made available to him because of "all these college kids suing each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conspiracyworldwide.podomatic.com/entry/2010-10-23T08_05_51-07_00 |title=Podomatic interview with Ben Mezrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Maslin|Maslin, Janet]]. (2009-07-19). [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/books/20maslin.html "Harvard Pals Grow Rich: Chronicling Facebook Without Face Time"] at ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
The story begins in the weeks that precede the launch of "thefacebook.com" at Harvard.  Eduardo Saverin, cast as the protagonist, has befriended Mark Zuckerberg, and both struggle for social acceptance—Saverin by joining a [[final club]], Zuckerberg by creating a website where girls can be ranked according to their looks.  Zuckerberg's stunt, though successful, puts him at odds with the Harvard Administrative Board, and has angered numerous campus women's groups as well as individual female students.  An article on the incident in the [[Harvard Crimson]] is noticed by three Harvard seniors: [[Winklevoss twins|twin brothers]] [[Cameron Winklevoss|Cameron]] and [[Tyler Winklevoss]] and [[Divya Narendra]], all of whom who are trying to launch a Harvard dating site.  The trio approaches Zuckerberg, convincing him to join in the venture.  Zuckerberg, however, feels their site does not have what he thinks is the right approach and begins developing thefacebook with financial help from Saverin and programming from Zuckerberg's roommates.

Once thefacebook.com is launched it becomes an immediate hit on campus.  After discovering what Zuckerberg has done, the Winklevoss' and Narendra are infuriated and seek legal advice from their father's lawyer.  The story then chronicles the changing relationship between Saverin and Zuckerberg, who have different visions for thefacebook.

While the first half of the book centers on the Harvard University campus and focuses on college life, the second half centers on the business end of thefacebook and Zuckerberg's move to [[Silicon Valley]].  [[Napster]] creator [[Sean Parker]] inserts himself into Zuckerberg's life, soon becoming a mentor to Zuckerberg who guides him to Silicon Valley venture capitalists and other players in the industry.  Saverin, having graduated from Harvard, continues to feel sidelined by Parker, who he feels is not the best influence on Zuckerberg and is replacing him in importance to the advancement of thefacebook.

The end of the book does not provide a conclusion since, according to the author's admission, matters of dispute are ongoing in the court of law.

== Film adaptation ==
[[Columbia Pictures]] released a film adaptation of the book in 2010 titled ''[[The Social Network]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Leah McLaren|McLaren, Leah]] |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/style/zuckerpunched-maybe-those-tech-nerds-arent-so-harmless/article1577360 |title=Zuckerpunched!

'''''The Old Musician''''' is an 1862 oil painting on canvas by [[France|French]] [[Painting|painter]] [[Édouard Manet]], produced during the period when the artist was influenced by Spanish art. The painting also betrays the influence of [[Gustave Courbet]]. This work is one of Manet's largest paintings and is now conserved at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection  - The Old Musician|url=https://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.46637.html|website=nga.cov|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is composed of seven characters in a landscape. The old musician in the center who is preparing to play the [[violin]] is Jean Lagrène, the leader of a local gypsy band.&lt;ref name="manet.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Old Musician, 1862 by Edouard Manet|url=http://www.manet.org/the-old-musician.jsp|website=manet.org|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the left is a young girl standing with a baby in her arms, as well as two young boys. In the background, the man in the top hat is the [[rag picker]] and [[ironmonger]] Colardet.&lt;ref name="manet.org" /&gt; At the right, the Oriental man (partly shown) with a [[turban]] and a long robe, represents Guéroult, a "[[wandering Jew]]".&lt;ref name="manet.org" /&gt; Attitudes and clothes of the characters seem to be inspired by [[Diego Velázquez]] or [[Louis Le Nain]].&lt;ref name="manet.org" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Édouard Manet, les premières œuvres |url=http://www.van-gogh.fr/edouard-manet-premieres-oeuvres-page-2.php |publisher=Van Gogh |language=French |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Édouard Manet  (artist), French, 1832 - 1883, ''The Old Musician'', 1862 |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg90/gg90-46637.html |publisher=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting contains a series of allusions: the man in the top hat is the same character as ''[[The Absinthe Drinker (Manet painting)|The Absinthe Drinker]]'', painted by Manet some years earlier and who reappears in this painting without any particular reason. The young boy in straw hat, meanwhile, is explicitly inspired by [[Antoine Watteau]]'s ''Pierrot''.

'''''The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion''''' is a 2012 [[social psychology]] book by [[Jonathan Haidt]], in which the author describes [[human]] [[morality]] as it relates to politics and religion.

==Summary==
In the first part of the book, the author uses research to demonstrate [[social intuitionism]], how people's beliefs come primarily from their intuitions, and rational thought often comes after to justify initial beliefs. In the second portion of the book, he presents [[moral foundations theory]], and applies it to the political beliefs of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]], [[conservatives]], and [[libertarians]] in the [[US]].

Haidt argues that people are too quick to denigrate other points of view without giving those views full consideration, and attempts to reach common ground between liberals and conservatives. He makes the case in the book for morality having multiple foundations (more than just harm and fairness), and said in an interview that morality "is at least six things, and probably a lot more than that"&lt;ref name="POI20120319"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jonathan Haidt — The Righteous Mind|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/jonathan_haidt_the_righteous_mind/|website=[[Point of Inquiry]]|publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]]|accessdate=12 December 2016|format=MP3 Podcast|date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8:55}} and "[religion and politics are] ... expressions of our tribal, groupish, righteous nature".&lt;ref name="POI20120319"/&gt;{{rp|13:06}} Haidt himself acknowledges that while he has been a liberal all his life,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2014/01/jonathan_haidt.html&lt;/ref&gt; he is now more open to other points of view.&lt;ref name="Saletan.2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/the-righteous-mind-by-jonathan-haidt.html?pagewanted=all | title=Why Won't They Listen?

[[File:Jacob van Ruisdael, een watermolen schetsend Rijksmuseum SK-A-4865.jpeg|thumb|Historical painting of Jacob van Ruisdael sketching a watermill in Gelderland, by [[Gerard Bilders]], a 19th-century landscape painter who was inspired by Ruisdael's work]]
'''''The Watermill''''' (c. 1660) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] landscape painter [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].
It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]].

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1911, who wrote; "146. THE WATER-MILL. View across the mill-pool towards 
the water-mill, which stands amid trees. The same mill as that painted by [[Meindert Hobbema|Hobbema]], as, for example, in the two pictures at the Rijksmuseum 
(see Hobbema, 66, 67). The building on the right is roofed with red tiles, and the timbers are grey. To the left is a green hill. There is no distant 
view. On the road to the left is a man, followed by a dog. To the right is a flowering elder bush. To judge from the style, the picture was 
probably painted about the time when Hobbema and Ruisdael worked together (1660-63). 
Signed with the monogram on the left ; canvas, 25 inches by 27 1/2 inches. 

Exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] Winter Exhibition, London, 1876, No. 80, and 1902, No. 134. 
In the collection of the Right Hon. Lewis Fry, Clifton, Bristol. "&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn04hofsuoft#page/51/mode/1up  Entry 146 (Ruisdael) for ''''The Water-Mill''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

This scene is very similar to other paintings Ruisdael and his pupil Hobbema made in this period and these often served as inspiration for later painters of landscape.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Scholars have tried to locate this specific watermill as it was portrayed so many times, but so far it has only been documented as being "somewhere in [[Gelderland]]."

'''Tito Enrique Canepa Jiménez''' (21 September 1916 - 11 February 2014)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/news/2014/07/25/recent-deaths-in-the-arts-31/]&lt;/ref&gt; was a leading Dominican painter of the generation that came of age in the 1930s and 1940s. Canepa's artistic identity was shaped in New York City, where he lived from the age of 21, never returning to stay in his native country. Despite this distance, or perhaps because of it, as León David has pointed out, his works always evince a certain ''dominicanidad'' without his setting out to achieve it as a goal — a ''dominicanidad'' that is never folkloric.&lt;ref&gt;León David, ''Cánepa'', 1988 – preface Jerrilynn D. Dodds. Santo Domingo: Galería de Arte Moderno, 1988, pp. 52, 56 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the three modernist Dominican painters of the 1930s and 40s —  Canepa, Colson and Suro — singled out by Rafael Díaz Niese in 1944 as most significant,&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Díaz-Niese, 'Notas sobre el arte actual', ''Quadernos de Cultura Dominicana'', No. 12 (1944), pp. 33 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Canepa is the one whose artistic activity developed in the most continuous absence from his native country, and the one longest resident in New York. Cánepa is accented in Spanish but not in the original Ligurian.

== Biography ==
[[File:Painting by Tito Canepa, Desnuda sobre la yerba, 1939.jpg|thumb|left|''Desnuda sobre la yerba'', oil on canvas, 86.4x61 cm, 1939, private collection.]]

Canepa was born in 1916 in San Pedro de Macorís in the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Danilo de los Santos, ''Memoria de la pintura dominicana'', Vol. II. Santo Domingo: Grupo León Jimenes, 2003, p. 337&lt;/ref&gt; His initial artistic studies were in his native country. After participating in the political movement against the Trujillo dictatorship his existence in the Dominican Republic became precarious, and he left for New York in 1935, settling there permanently in 1937 when he accepted a position in the New York Siqueiros workshop on 13th Street.&lt;ref&gt;Hurlburt, Laurence P., ''The Mexican Muralists in the United States'', University of New Mexico Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  There he worked under [[Roberto Berdecio]] on a number of murals, while attending class at the [[Art Students League]].  Exile intensified his childhood memories, which were colored by his maternal family's progressive republican and anti-colonial traditions. Two of his maternal ancestors had been presidents of the Dominican Republic: [[Manuel Jimenes]] (presidency 1848-1849), a product of the Enlightenment and abolitionism, and [[Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra]] (presidency 1902-1916). In addition, Canepa's art reflected his paternal Genovese family's seafaring history and his father's extravagant construction of a small opera theater in San Pedro de Macorís, the Teatro Colón. It was there, watching the Spanish painter Enrique Tarazona at work, that Canepa gained "the sweeping confidence and bold absorption of historical styles that characterizes much" of his painting, "absorbing his catechism of old masters at such an early age that it became a digested part of his work."&lt;ref&gt;Jerrilynn D. Dodds, preface to León David, ''Cánepa''. Santo Domingo: Galería de Arte Moderno, 1988, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York he was steeped in the artistic and social ferment of the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] period. He exhibited in the Bonestell and ACA galleries, and his early circle of friends, with whom he exchanged paintings and drawings, included the painters [[David Burliuk]], [[Pavel Tchelitchew]], [[Walter Houmère]], [[Rufino Tamayo]] and [[Mario Carreño Morales|Mario Carreño]] and (later) [[Edward Laning]]. Far from setting out to become a 'Dominican' painter, he felt himself to be part of a broader tradition. Here a key influence was his mentor, the Dominican art historian and musicologist [[Américo Lugo Romero]]. With Lugo he spent almost every day of the better part of a year in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, absorbing his mentor's working connoisseurship of Renaissance art as the two discussed and challenged attributions of paintings.

His earliest recognition in the Dominican Republic came from [[Rafael Díaz Niese]], on the occasion of a show of self-portraits in 1943 at the Galería Nacional de Bellas Artes in Santo Domingo. Díaz Niese's essay established Canepa, [[Darío Suro]] and [[Jaime Colson]] as the trinity of Dominican artists who led the second generation of high modernism (1930s and 1940s). Of Canepa's now lost 1943 self-portrait, Díaz Niese wrote: 

&lt;blockquote&gt; An intense inner life animated this small-sized work. All its elements indicated that its author was more than a mere painter, but rather a true artist: The strength of the lines, the realization of the volumes in a perfect succession of planes and the exquisite restraint with which he has been able to shape his youthful expressiveness while using a rather cool tonality – all of this makes it plain that the author possesses an exceptional artistic temperament.&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Díaz-Niese, ''Quadernos de Cultura Dominicana'', No. 12 (1944), quoted in Danilo de los Santos, ''Memoria de la pintura dominicana'', Vol. II. Santo Domingo: Grupo León Jimenes, 2003, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding other early works and against the background Canepa's familiarity with Renaissance art, Díaz Niese summed up the outstanding qualities of his paintings:

{{quote| ... sobriety, the organizational logic of his compositions and the intense love for strongly drawn forms within an atmosphere of brightness and exquisite beauty.

These qualities — according to Danilo de los Santos citing Díaz Niese — which are tied to the preeminence of the human figure as the subject of painting, are reinforced as his art reaches a "certain sense of monumentality (…) visible even in his smaller figures, which magnify an admirably precise and severe draftsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;Danilo de los Santos, ''Memoria de la pintura dominicana'', Vol. II. Santo Domingo: Grupo León Jimenes, 2003, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his early works, according to Edward Sullivan, "the figures are solidly constructed in an almost sculptural fashion. They exist in a seemingly timeless realm"; in works of the 1970s he seems to be paying homage to Mantegna, Piero and other Quattrocento artists who "demonstrated such interest in the cool, calm and quasi-mathematical measuring of space. Many of these compositions are highly expansive and suggest the ambitious spatial descriptions of mural paintings."&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Sullivan, ''Tito Canepa: An Exhibition of Early and Recent Paintings'', September 3-September 30, 1992, Step Gallery, New York. New York: Step Gallery, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tito Canepa painting The Dream - 1975.jpg|thumb|left|''The Dream'', acrylic on gesso panel, 91.4x121.9 cm, 1975, private collection.]]
Dream symbolism, the "nostalgic search for a vanished land" and the exploration of the "mysterious realm of family and childhood" are among the themes that León David identified in Canepa's work.&lt;ref&gt;León David, ''Cánepa'', 1988 – preface by Jerrilynn D. Dodds. Santo Domingo: Galería de Arte Moderno, 1988, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War Canepa served in the US Army's Signal Corps making propaganda films. In 1944 he married the modern dancer [[Florence Lessing]].&lt;ref&gt;"Florence Lessing, 86, a Dancer in Theater, Nightclubs and Films," ''New York Times'', September 9, 2002 https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/22/nyregion/florence-lessing-86-a-dancer-in-theater-nightclubs-and-films.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, from New York, he was centrally involved in the group of political leaders planning to bring down the dictator of the Dominican Republic [[Rafael Trujillo|Trujillo]].&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Rodríguez de León, ''El Furioso Merengue del Norte. Una Historia de la Comunidad Dominicana en los Estados Unidos'', New York: Editorial Sitel, 1998, pp. 133-134.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s his work was the object of a series of articles in Dominican newspapers, notably those by [[María Ugarte]], a leading expert on the country's cultural and artistic heritage, in ''El Caribe'', and by poet and art critic León David, in ''El Síglo''. This renewed interest was largely triggered by one event: the efforts of a member of the Trujillo family to seize his historical triptych ''Enriquillo – Duarte – Luperón'' (1971) while still in the Santo Domingo airport.&lt;ref&gt;The triptych was brought to Santo Domingo to be exhibited. Confidential information indicated that a member of the  Trujillo family was about to have it seized at the airport for his own use while it was in the Dominican customs area. Canepa was urgently advised to move the triptych back to the airline's hangar and have it returned to the US. It thus never left the airport (information from a conversation with Tito Canepa).&lt;/ref&gt; The new appreciation culminated in the publication in 1988 of León David's monograph.&lt;ref&gt;León David, ''Cánepa'', 1988 – preface Jerrilynn D. Dodds. Santo Domingo: Galería de Arte Moderno, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tito Canepa, Triptych (1971), Enriquillo - Duarte - Luperón, acrylic on gesso panels, each panel 1.829 x .9144 m.jpg|frame|right|''Triptych: Enriquillo-Duarte-Luperón'', acrylic on gesso boards, 182.88x91.44 cm, 1971, private collection.]]
In the 1980s Canepa together with several other Dominican artists, including [[Bismarck Victoria]], [[Freddy Rodríguez (artist)|Freddy Rodríguez]] and [[Magno Laracuente]] formed the Dominican Visual Artists of New York (DVANY), which organized several important exhibitions.

In 1992 he was the recipient of a lifetime achievement award from the Fundación Ciencia y Arte of the Dominican Republic, with "the eternal gratitude of the Dominican people for [his] pictorial oeuvre."

In the 1990s, Canepa exhibited his work in a number of shows, including a show of Latin American art at the Mexican Cultural Institute in Washington DC and the Step Gallery in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Sullivan, ''Tito Canepa: An Exhibition of Early and Recent Paintings'', September 3-September 30, 1992, Step Gallery, New York. New York: Step Gallery, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 his by now famous triptych ''Enriquillo - Duarte - Luperón'' was chosen as the cover illustration for the most important group show of Dominican art ever to have been mounted outside the country: ''Modern and Contemporary Art from the Dominican Republic''  co-organised by the Spanish Institute and Americas Society, New York, in which his works occupied a significant place. The exhibition also travelled to the Bass Museum of Art, Miami Beach.

In 2005, the [[CUNY Dominican Studies Institute]] inaugurated their archives with an extensive collection of Tito Canepa's letters, drawings and photographs,&lt;ref&gt;"CUNY Dominican Studies Institute: Tito Cánepa Collection" http://www.ccny.cuny.edu/dsi/archives-tito-canepa-collection.cfm Retrieved 2014-03/24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Tito Cánepa donó correspondencias personales al Instituto de Estudios Dominicanos de la Universidad de Nueva York," Fundglode: Novedades y Noticias, Santo Domingo, April 17, 2008 http://new.funglode.org.do/?post_type=notice&amp;p=1438 Retrieved 2014-03/24.&lt;/ref&gt; along with three paintings: ''Ojeda y Caonabo'' (1984), ''The Sisters Mirabál'' (1985) and ''The Gulf of Arrows'' (1987).

In 2008 the Fundación Global Democracia y Desarollo (Global Foundation for Democracy and Development) and the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute organized a show at the Galería de Arte FUNGLODE in Santo Domingo, ''Tito Cánepa – 60 Years of Asserting Dominican Art in the United States''.&lt;ref&gt;"FUNGLODE, GFDD y el Instituto de Estudios Dominicanos de CUNY celebrarán un especial homenaje al pintor dominicano Tito Cánepa," Fundglode: Novedades y Noticias, Santo Domingo, April 3, 2008 http://new.funglode.org.do/?post_type=notice&amp;p=1429 Retrieved 2014-03/24; and "Rinden homenaje a Tito Canepa," ''Hoy'', April 22, 2008 http://hoy.com.do/rinden-homenaje-a-tito-canepa/ Retrieved 2014-03/24.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Brooke Thomas Trego''' (15 September, 1858 &amp;ndash; 24 June, 1909) was an [[United States|American]] [[Painting|painter]] best known for his historical [[Military art|military subjects]], in particular scenes of the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] and [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michenermuseum.org/bucksartists/artist.php?artist=281&amp;page=1191 James A. Michener Art Museum: Bucks County Artists - William B. T. Trego]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
William B. T. Trego was born in [[Yardley, Pennsylvania|Yardley]], [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]], [[Pennsylvania]] in 1858, the son of the artist [[Jonathan Kirkbridge Trego]] and Emily Roberts née Thomas. At the age of two William's hands and feet became nearly paralyzed, either from [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], or from a doctor administering a dose of [[calomel]] (mercurous chloride). Trego's family moved to Detroit in 1874 where William was enrolled in the local school, but an incident where 16-year-old William burned off all his hair with a [[Gas lighting|gas jet]] made his father decide to teach William in his studio from then on. Despite his crippled hands, young William showed an aptitude for art, learning to paint with a brush jammed in his right hand while he guided it with his left.&lt;ref name=battery&gt;Battery B, 4th U.S. Light Artillery [http://www.batteryb.com/trego.html William B.T. Trego]&lt;/ref&gt; William Trego first received public attention when he exhibited a painting titled ''The Charge of Custer at Winchester'' in 1879 at the [[Michigan State Fair]]. His depiction of [[George Armstrong Custer]]'s charge at the [[Third Battle of Winchester]] was described by the ''[[Cleveland Press]]'' as "one of the best historical paintings of the kind that has ever been produced by an American artist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A historical account of the Trego family|page =71|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9ZJZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA71|year=1884|publisher=Press of I. Freidenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pennsylvania Academy years===
[[File:Battery of Light Artillery en Route William T Trego 1883.png|thumb|left|300px|''Battery of Light Artillery en Route'' (1882)]]
Later that year, Trego used the proceeds from the sale of ''The Charge of Custer at Winchester'' to enroll himself at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gratzgallery.com/artist_trego.html Gratz Gallery bio - William Trego]&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at PAFA for three years under [[Thomas Eakins]], in courses that included instruction on aspects of the human figure, including anatomical study of the human and animal body and surgical dissection. Trego did not appreciate Eakins' rigorous, terse teaching style, and would later remark:
:"''Fortunately for myself I was drilled in the principles of drawing in my father's studio before I went to the Academy, so that I was able to some extent to brave the sarcasm and neglect of Eakins''"&lt;ref name="tfaoi.com"&gt;[http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/8aa/8aa147.htm http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/8aa/8aa147.htm "The Artist as Interpreter of American History"] by Mark Thistlethwaite excerpted from the exhibition catalogue "In This Academy: The Pennsylvanian Academy of the Fine Arts 1805 - 1976"&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The March to Valley Forge William Trego.png|thumb|right|300px|''The March to Valley Forge'' (1883), [[Museum of the American Revolution]]]]
In an 1882 Academy exhibition, Trego won the first Toppan Prize for his work, ''Battery of Light Artillery en Route,'' and the painting was subsequently purchased for the Academy by [[Fairman Rogers]]. In 1883, Trego received what he thought was a snub from the Academy when the art jury for the Temple Competition of Historical Paintings, a competition intended to help revive historical painting by limiting entries to depictions of the American War of Independence",&lt;ref name="tfaoi.com"/&gt; decided there were no paintings of sufficient quality to merit a 1st or second place, and awarded Trego 3rd place for his painting of [[George Washington]] and his troops called ''The March to Valley Forge''.&lt;ref&gt;note: This painting has many titles including "The March to Valley Forge", "Washington Reviewing His Troops At Valley Forge" and "Washington reviewing his Ragged Army at Valley Forge"&lt;/ref&gt; Trego sued the Academy on the grounds that if his painting was the best overall, it should receive first place (and he should get the $3,000 prize money). In 1886, he lost the case, with the [[Pennsylvania Supreme Court]] ruling the jury was well within their rights under the contract of the exhibit to award prizes as they saw fit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/20092259 Patronage Gone Awry: The 1883 Temple Competition of Historical Paintings], by Mark Thistlethwaite, 1988, Historical Society of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Wales studio===
[[File:Civil War Battle Scene 1887 William T Trego.png|thumb|left|250px|''Civil War Battle Scene'', (1887) an example of Trego's realistic depiction of battle.]]
After leaving the Academy, Trego lived in [[North Wales, Pennsylvania]], with his mother and father. Except for trips abroad, Trego would live in North Wales for the rest of his life, working in a studio behind his house. He used the town residents, their horses, and the surrounding landscape as models and backdrops for his paintings. Trego was becoming well known for the accuracy of his military depictions as well as the honest, sometimes brutal realism, especially in his Civil War subjects&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the American Civil War, by David Stephen Heidler, Jeanne T. Heidler, David J. Coles, page 117 [https://books.google.com/?id=SdrYv7S60fgC&amp;pg=PA117 Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; The Civil War works were well received and Trego had much success selling paintings during that time.

===Paris studies===
[[File:The Color Guard - William B. T. Trego (1888).jpg|thumb|''The Color Guard'', French [[dragoon]]s, 1888.]]
In 1887, he went to Paris to study at the [[Académie Julian]] under the [[France|French]] [[Academic art|academic painter]]s [[Tony Robert-Fleury]] and [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]. Trego studied at the French museums while he was there and enjoyed the Paris night life with other Pennsylvania Academy alumni such as [[Robert Henri]], [[Augustus B. Koopman]], [[Henry McCarter]], and [[Frederick J. Waugh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.williamtrego.com/documents_images.htm The William B.T.

One French writer thought this work put Trego on par with the famous French academic military artist, [[Édouard Detaille]].&lt;ref&gt;William Brooke Thomas Trego (1858-1909), The End of the Charge - [http://www.williamttrego.org/The_End_of_the_Charge.html williamttrego.org]&lt;/ref&gt; On his ocean voyage home from Paris in 1890, Trego returned to America not only with new found knowledge of French academic painting, he also returned with a French fiancée.

===Later years===
After his return to the States, Trego's work received much acclaim from critics. In 1891, noted American art collector [[Thomas Benedict Clarke]] wrote of Trego:

:"''In the accomplishment of his work, which is marked by strength, firmness, and force, he has had to overcome physical infirmities that would have made a less brave and earnest character halt at the threshold''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catalogue of the Thomas B. Clarke collection of American pictures|author=Thomas Benedict Clarke, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts|publisher=Times printing house|year=1891|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZADAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these accolades and the prestige of exhibiting in the Paris Salon, Trego found it hard to sell paintings due to the declining in popularity of [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] military artwork. He painted portraits and [[genre painting]]s to make money and took on work doing book and magazine illustration. He also tried unsuccessfully to become an instructor at The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. He lived with, and was supported by, his parents during the 1890s. Trego's father died in 1901 and his stepmother died six years later. Trego's increasing financial problems during this time made him take on students including [[Walter Emerson Baum]] and his wife, Flora. Trego tried to revive his career by basing a painting on the popular novel ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben Hur]]'' with one of his last works, ''The Chariot Race from Ben Hur'' (1908). He sent it to the 1909 [[National Academy of Design]] exhibition in New York but it failed to spark any interest.&lt;ref&gt;William Brooke Thomas Trego (1858-1909), ''The Chariot Race from Ben Hur'' [http://www.williamttrego.org/Chariot_Race.html williamttrego.org]&lt;/ref&gt; William Trego was found unconscious in his studio on June 24, 1909 and was dead by the time the doctor arrived.

During his lifetime, Trego had painted over 200 historical and military paintings. These would become so widely published after his death that writer [[Edwin Augustus Peeples]] commented: 
:"''There is probably not an American History book which doesn't have (a) Trego picture in it''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michenermuseum.org/bucksartists/artist.php?artist=281&amp;page=1191 michenermuseum.org - William B. T. Trego]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1976, Trego's ''The March to Valley Forge'' had become such an iconic image of that event that it was reproduced as a souvenir postage sheet issued by the [[United States Postal Service]] as part of the observance of the [[United States Bicentennial]]. It is currently on loan from the [[Museum of the American Revolution]] to [[Valley Forge National Historical Park]].

A book was published about Trego's life, So Bravely and So Well: The Life and Art of William T. Trego, by Joseph P. Eckhardt, in 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4679">'''Women of Color Quilters Network (WCQN)''' is a national organization dedicated to preserving African American quiltmaking. 

==History==
The Women of Color Quilters Network was founded in 1986 by [[Carolyn L. Mazloomi]].

For many years in the early 1980s Mazloomi had tried unsuccessfully to expand her circle of African American quilters. She eventually placed an advertisement in Quilter’s Newsletter Magazine requesting correspondence with other quilters who shared this frustration. She received several responses to this advertisement, and the resulting correspondence led to the formation of the Women of Color Quilters Network (WCQN).&lt;ref&gt; Quilter’s Exchange – Needle and Pin Pals.” Quilters Newsletter Magazine, February 1986, p. 41. Carolyn Mazloomi wishes to correspond with “Black quilters worldwide.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Founding members of the WCQN included Carolyn, Claire E. Carter, aRma Carter, [[Cuesta Benberry]], Meloydy Boyd, [[Michael_Cummings_(quilter)|Michael Cummings]], [[Peggie Hartwell]] and Marie Wilson.

In 1992-1993, a survey of WCQN members, conducted by quilter Sandra German, indicated members had low expectations for fairness, acceptance, and success from traditional or mainstream quilting ventures (e.g., quilt guilds, magazines, contests).&lt;ref&gt; “Surfacing: The Inevitable Rise of the Women of Color Quilters’ Network” In Uncovering 1993, ed. Laurel Horton, pp. 137 – 168. San Francisco: American Quilt Study Group, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The objectives of the organization include the fostering and preservation of the art of quilt making among women and men of color, researching quilt history and documenting quilts, and offering authentic, handmade African American quilts and fiber art to museums and galleries for exhibition.

WCQN membership surpassed 1,000 quilters from the U.S., Canada, the Caribbean and England. &lt;ref&gt;Martin, Charles. “What’s New and News in Quilting – Women of Color Network Membership Approaches 1,000.” Quilter’s Newsletter Magazine, May 1996, p. 7. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; German, Sandra K. “Surfacing: The Inevitable Rise of the Women of Color Quilters’ Network” In Uncovering 1993, ed. Laurel Horton, pp. 137 – 168. San Francisco: American Quilt Study Group, 1994.  &lt;/ref&gt;

Many members specialize in narrative quilts on contemporary African-American themes because, as Mazloomi pointed out, "we are a people with many stories to tell."&lt;ref&gt; Life's Thread Stitched Into Quilts,” by Patricial Leigh Brown, New York Times, April 04, 1996.  &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dfaPC_WSlNwC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=WCQN&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BKMQd3NQh4&amp;sig=_GS40MQydm2rr06o5sikaoch6Ns&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=txRoUfO-GKOOyAGr8oDICQ&amp;ved=0CGoQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=WCQN&amp;f=false Crafted Lives] Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

WCQN members continue to exhibit their quilts in community venues, local galleries and museums. In 2004, the Museum of Biblical Art sponsored the traveling exhibition, Threads of Faith: Recent Works from the Women of Color Quilters Network. &lt;ref&gt;[http://mobia.org/exhibitions/threads-of-faith#slideshow1 Museum of Biblical Arts, Past Exhibitions.]&lt;/ref&gt;
