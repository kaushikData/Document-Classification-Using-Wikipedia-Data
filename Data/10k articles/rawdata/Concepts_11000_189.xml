In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], the [[abstraction]] of '''actual [[infinity]]''' involves the acceptance (if the [[axiom of infinity]] is included) of infinite entities, such as the set of all [[natural numbers]] or an infinite sequence of [[rational numbers]], as given, actual, completed objects. This is contrasted with '''potential infinity''', in which a non-terminating process (such as "add 1 to the previous number") produces a sequence with no last element, and each individual result is finite and is achieved in a finite number of steps.

== Anaximander ==

{{seemain|Apeiron (cosmology)}}

The ancient Greek term for the potential or improper infinite was ''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]'' (unlimited or indefinite), in contrast to the actual or proper infinite ''aphorismenon''.{{fact|date=March 2018}} ''Apeiron'' stands opposed to that which has a ''peras'' (limit). These notions are today denoted by ''potentially infinite'' and ''actually infinite'', respectively.

[[Anaximander]] (610–546&amp;nbsp;BC) held that the '' apeiron'' was the principle or main element composing all things.  Clearly, the 'apeiron' was some sort of basic substance. [[Plato]]'s notion of the ''apeiron'' is more abstract, having to do with indefinite variability. The main dialogues where Plato discusses the 'apeiron' are the late dialogues ''Parmenides'' and the ''Philebus''.

==Aristotle==
[[Aristotle]] sums up the views of his predecessors on infinity thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Only the [[Pythagoreans]] place the infinite among the objects of sense (they do not regard number as separable from these), and assert that what is outside the heaven is infinite. Plato, on the other hand, holds that there is no body outside (the Forms are not outside because they are nowhere), yet that the infinite is present not only in the objects of sense but in the Forms also. (Aristotle)"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theme was brought forward by Aristotle's consideration of the apeiron in the context of mathematics and physics (the study of nature).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Infinity turns out to be the opposite of what people say it is. It is not 'that which has nothing beyond itself' that is infinite, but 'that which always has something beyond itself'. (Aristotle)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Belief in the existence of the infinite comes mainly from five considerations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CD0IRPg4roC&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;ots=Y1cIbHE3MX&amp;dq=Belief%20in%20the%20existence%20of%20the%20infinite%20comes%20mainly%20from%20five%20considerations:&amp;pg=PA169#v=onepage&amp;q=Belief%20in%20the%20existence%20of%20the%20infinite%20comes%20mainly%20from%20five%20considerations:&amp;f=false|title=Commentary on Aristotle's Physics|last=Thomas|first=Kenneth W.|last2=Thomas|first2=Thomas, Aquinas|date=2003-06-01|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781843715450|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# From the nature of time – for it is infinite.
# From the division of magnitudes – for the mathematicians also use the notion of the infinite.
# If coming to be and passing away do not give out, it is only because that from which things come to be is infinite.
# Because the limited always finds its limit in something, so that there must be no limit, if everything is always limited by something different from itself.
# Most of all, a reason which is peculiarly appropriate and presents the difficulty that is felt by everybody – not only number but also mathematical magnitudes and what is outside the heaven are supposed to be infinite because they never give out in our thought. (Aristotle)
Aristotle postulated that an actual infinity was impossible, because if it were possible, then something would have attained infinite magnitude, and would be "bigger than the heavens." However, he said, mathematics relating to infinity was not deprived of its applicability by this impossibility, because mathematicians did not need the infinite for their theorems, just an arbitrarily large finite magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.logoslibrary.org/aristotle/physics/37.html|title=Logos Virtual Library: Aristotle: Physics, III, 7|website=www.logoslibrary.org|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle's potential–actual distinction===
[[Aristotle]] handled the topic of infinity in ''Physics'' and in ''Metaphysics''. He distinguished between ''actual'' and ''potential'' infinity. ''Actual infinity'' is completed and definite, and consists of infinitely many elements. ''Potential infinity'' is never complete: elements can be always added, but never infinitely many. 

{{quote
|"For generally the infinite has this mode of existence: one thing is always being taken after another, and each thing that is taken is always finite, but always different."
|Aristotle, Physics, book 3, chapter 6.}}

Aristotle distinguished between infinity with respect to addition and division.

{{quote |But Plato has two infinities, the Great and the Small.
|Physics, book 3, chapter 4.}}

"As an example of a potentially infinite series in respect to increase, one number can always be added after another in the series that starts 1,2,3,... but the process of adding more and more numbers cannot be exhausted or completed."

With respect to division, a potentially infinite sequence of divisions starts e.g. as 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, but the process division cannot be exhausted or completed.

{{quote |"For the fact that the process of dividing never comes to an end ensures that this activity exists potentially, but not that the infinite exists separately."
| Metaphysics, book 9, chapter 6.}}

In mathematics, the infinite series 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + · · · is an elementary example of a geometric series that converges.

==Scholastic philosophers==
The overwhelming majority of [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophers]] adhered to the motto ''Infinitum actu non datur''. This means there is only a (developing, improper, "syncategorematic") ''potential infinity'' but not a (fixed, proper, "categorematic") ''actual infinity''. There were exceptions, however, for example in England. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is well known that in the Middle Ages all scholastic philosophers advocate Aristotle's "infinitum actu non datur" as an irrefutable principle. ([[Georg Cantor|G. Cantor]] [3, p.&amp;nbsp;174])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The number of points in a segment one ell long is its true measure. ([[Robert Grosseteste|R. Grosseteste]] [9, p.&amp;nbsp;96])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Actual infinity exists in number, time and quantity. (J. Baconthorpe [9, p.&amp;nbsp;96])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the Renaissance and by early modern times the voices in favor of actual infinity were rather rare.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The continuum actually consists of infinitely many indivisibles ([[Galileo Galilei|G. Galilei]] [9, p.&amp;nbsp;97])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am so in favour of actual infinity. ([[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|G.W. Leibniz]] [9, p.&amp;nbsp;97])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The majority{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} agreed with the well-known quote of Gauss:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I protest against the use of infinite magnitude as something completed, which is never permissible in mathematics. Infinity is merely a way of speaking, the true meaning being a limit which certain ratios approach indefinitely close, while others are permitted to increase without restriction.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Kleene 1952 (1971 edition):48 attributes the first sentence of this quote to (Werke VIII p. 216).&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Carl Friedrich Gauss|C.F. Gauss]] [in a letter to Schumacher, 12 July 1831])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The drastic change was initialized by Bolzano and Cantor in the 19th century.

[[Bernard Bolzano]] who introduced the notion of ''set'' (in German: ''Menge'') and Georg Cantor who introduced [[set theory]] opposed the general attitude. Cantor distinguished three realms of infinity: (1) the infinity of God (which he called the "absolutum"), (2) the infinity of reality (which he called "nature") and (3) the transfinite numbers and sets of mathematics.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A multitude which is larger than any finite multitude, i.e., a multitude with the property that every finite set [of members of the kind in question] is only a part of it, I will call an infinite multitude. (B. Bolzano [2, p.&amp;nbsp;6])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are twice as many focuses as centres of ellipses. (B. Bolzano [2a, § 93])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Accordingly I distinguish an eternal uncreated infinity or absolutum which is due to God and his attributes, and a created infinity or transfinitum, which has to be used wherever in the created nature an actual infinity has to be noticed, for example, with respect to, according to my firm conviction, the actually infinite number of created individuals, in the universe as well as on our earth and, most probably, even in every arbitrarily small extended piece of space. (G. Cantor [3, p.&amp;nbsp;399; 8, p.&amp;nbsp;252])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One proof is based on the notion of God. First, from the highest perfection of God, we infer the possibility of the creation of the transfinite, then, from his all-grace and splendor, we infer the necessity that the creation of the transfinite in fact has happened. (G. Cantor [3, p.&amp;nbsp;400])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The numbers are a free creation of human mind. ([[Richard Dedekind|R. Dedekind]] [3a, p.&amp;nbsp;III])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Opposition from the Intuitionist school==
The mathematical meaning of the term "actual" in '''actual infinity''' is synonymous with '''definite''', '''completed''', '''extended''' or '''existential''',&lt;ref name="Kleene 1952/1971:48."&gt;Kleene 1952/1971:48.&lt;/ref&gt; but not to be mistaken for ''physically existing''. The question of whether [[Natural number|natural]] or [[real numbers]] form definite sets is therefore independent of the question of whether infinite things exist physically in [[nature]].

Proponents of [[intuitionism]], from [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]] onwards, reject the claim that there are actually infinite mathematical objects or sets. Consequently, they reconstruct the foundations of mathematics in a way that does not assume the existence of actual infinities.  On the other hand, [[constructive analysis]] does accept the existence of the completed infinity of the integers.

For intuitionists, infinity is described as ''potential''; terms synonymous with this notion are ''becoming'' or ''constructive''.&lt;ref name="Kleene 1952/1971:48."/&gt; For example, [[Stephen Kleene]] describes the notion of a [[Turing machine]] tape as "a linear 'tape', (potentially) infinite in both directions."&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952/1971:48 p. 357; also "the machine ... is supplied with a tape having a (potentially) infinite printing ..." (p. 363).&lt;/ref&gt; To access memory on the tape, a Turing machine moves a ''read head'' along it in finitely many steps: the tape is therefore only "potentially" infinite, since while there is always the ability to take another step, infinity itself is never actually reached.&lt;ref&gt;Or, the "tape" may be fixed and the reading "head" may move. Roger Penrose suggests this because: "For my own part, I feel a little uncomfortable about having our finite device moving a potentially infinite tape backwards and forwards. No matter how lightweight its material, an ''infinite'' tape might be hard to shift!" Penrose's drawing shows a fixed tape head labelled "TM" reading limp tape from boxes extending to the visual vanishing point. (Cf page 36 in Roger Penrose, 1989, ''The Emperor's New Mind'', Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, {{ISBN|0-19-851973-7}}). Other authors solve this problem by tacking on more tape when the machine is about to run out.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematicians generally accept actual infinities.&lt;ref&gt;Actual infinity follows from, for example, the acceptance of the notion of the integers as a set, see J J O'Connor and E F Robertson, [ [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Infinity.html "Infinity"].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Cantor]] is the most significant mathematician who defended actual infinities, equating the [[Absolute Infinite]] with God. He decided that it is possible for natural and real numbers to be definite sets, and that if one rejects the axiom of Euclidean finiteness (that states that actualities, singly and in aggregates, are necessarily finite), then one is not involved in any [[contradiction]].

The philosophical problem of actual infinity concerns whether the notion is coherent and epistemically sound.

==Classical set theory==
Classical set theory accepts the notion of actual, completed infinities.  However, some [[finitism|finitist]] philosophers of mathematics and constructivists object to the notion.&lt;blockquote&gt;If the positive number ''n'' becomes infinitely great, the expression 1/''n'' goes to naught (or gets infinitely small). In this sense one speaks of the improper or potential infinite. In sharp and clear contrast the set just considered is a readily finished, locked infinite set, fixed in itself, containing infinitely many exactly defined elements (the natural numbers) none more and none less. ([[Adolf Abraham Halevi Fraenkel|A. Fraenkel]] [4, p.&amp;nbsp;6])&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus the conquest of actual infinity may be considered an expansion of our scientific horizon no less revolutionary than the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] or than the theory of relativity, or even of quantum and nuclear physics. (A. Fraenkel [4, p.&amp;nbsp;245])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;To look at the universe of all sets not as a fixed entity but as an entity capable of "growing", i.e., we are able to "produce" bigger and bigger sets. (A. Fraenkel et al. [5, p.&amp;nbsp;118])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;([[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]]) maintains that a veritable continuum which is not denumerable can be obtained as a medium of free development; that is to say, besides the points which exist (are ready) on account of their definition by laws, such as e, pi, etc. other points of the continuum are not ready but develop as so-called [[choice sequence]]s. (A. Fraenkel et al. [5, p.&amp;nbsp;255])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Intuitionists reject the very notion of an arbitrary sequence of integers, as denoting something finished and definite as illegitimate. Such a sequence is considered to be a growing object only and not a finished one. (A. Fraenkel et al. [5, p.&amp;nbsp;236])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Until then, no one envisioned the possibility that infinities come in different sizes, and moreover, mathematicians had no use for “actual infinity.” The arguments using infinity, including the Differential [[Calculus]] of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], do not require the use of infinite sets. (T. Jech [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/set-theory/#1])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Owing to the gigantic simultaneous efforts of [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]] and Cantor, the infinite was set on a throne and revelled in its total triumph. In its daring flight the infinite reached dizzying heights of success. ([[David Hilbert|D. Hilbert]] [6, p.&amp;nbsp;169])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the most vigorous and fruitful branches of mathematics [...] a paradise created by Cantor from which nobody shall ever expel us [...] the most admirable blossom of the mathematical mind and altogether one of the outstanding achievements of man's purely intellectual activity. (D. Hilbert on set theory [6])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Finally, let us return to our original topic, and let us draw the conclusion from all our reflections on the infinite. The overall result is then: The infinite is nowhere realized. Neither is it present in nature nor is it admissible as a foundation of our rational thinking – a remarkable harmony between being and thinking. (D. Hilbert [6, 190])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Infinite totalities do not exist in any sense of the word (i.e., either really or ideally). More precisely, any mention, or purported mention, of infinite totalities is, literally, meaningless. ([[Abraham Robinson|A. Robinson]] [10, p.&amp;nbsp;507])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Indeed, I think that there is a real need, in formalism and elsewhere, to link our understanding of mathematics with our understanding of the physical world.  (A. Robinson)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Georg Cantor's grand meta-narrative, Set Theory, created by him almost singlehandedly in the span of about fifteen years, resembles a piece of high art more than a scientific theory. ([[Yuri Manin|Y. Manin]] [https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0209244])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, exquisite minimalism of expressive means is used by Cantor to achieve a sublime goal: understanding infinity, or rather infinity of infinities. (Y. Manin [https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0209244])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no actual infinity, that the Cantorians have forgotten and have been trapped by contradictions. ([[Henri Poincaré|H. Poincaré]] [Les mathématiques et la logique III, Rev. métaphys. morale '''14''' (1906) p.&amp;nbsp;316])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the objects of discussion are linguistic entities [...] then that collection of entities may vary as a result of discussion about them. A consequence of this is that the "natural numbers" of today are not the same as the "natural numbers" of yesterday. (D. Isles [http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Display&amp;handle=euclid.ndjfl/1093634481&amp;abstract=])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are at least two different ways of looking at the numbers: as a completed infinity and as an incomplete infinity... regarding the numbers as an incomplete infinity offers a viable and interesting alternative to regarding the numbers as a completed infinity, one that leads to great simplifications in some areas of mathematics and that has strong connections with problems of computational complexity. (E. Nelson [http://www.math.princeton.edu/~nelson/papers/e.pdf])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the renaissance, particularly with [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]], actual infinity transfers from God to the world. The finite world models of contemporary science clearly show how this power of the idea of actual infinity has ceased with classical (modern) physics. Under this aspect, the inclusion of actual infinity into mathematics, which explicitly started with G. Cantor only towards the end of the last century, seems displeasing. Within the intellectual overall picture of our century ... actual infinity brings about an impression of anachronism. ([[Paul Lorenzen|P. Lorenzen]][http://www.sgipt.org/wisms/geswis/mathe/lor01.gif])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Cell S1, lock-up of the Old Supreme Court Building, Singapore - 20101010.jpg|thumb|upright|A cell of the [[Old Supreme Court Building, Singapore|Old Supreme Court Building]] lock-up. Article 9 of the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]] guarantees the [[right to life|rights to life]] and [[political freedom|personal liberty]] and other rights of arrested persons, but these rights are not absolute.]]

'''Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore''', specifically Article 9(1), guarantees the [[right to life]] and the [[political freedom|right to personal liberty]]. The [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] has called the right to life the most basic of human rights, but has yet to fully define the term in the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]]. Contrary to the broad position taken in jurisdictions such as Malaysia and the United States, the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] of [[Singapore]] has said that personal liberty only refers to freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention.

Article 9(1) states that persons may be deprived of life or personal liberty "in accordance with law". In ''[[Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (1980), an appeal to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] from Singapore, it was held that the term ''law'' means more than just legislation validly enacted by [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]], and includes fundamental rules of [[natural justice]]. Subsequently, in ''[[Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General]]'' (2011), the Court of Appeal held that such fundamental rules of natural justice embodied in the Constitution are the same in nature and function as [[common law]] rules of natural justice in [[administrative law in Singapore|administrative law]], except that they operate at different levels of the legal order. A related decision, ''[[Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (2010), apparently rejected the contention that Article 9(1) entitles courts to examine the substantive fairness of legislation, though it asserted a judicial discretion to reject [[bill of attainder|bills of attainder]] and absurd or arbitrary legislation. In the same case, the Court of Appeal held that ''law'' in Article 9(1) does not include rules of [[customary international law]].

Other subsections of Article 9 enshrine rights accorded to persons who have been arrested, namely, the right to apply to the High Court to challenge the legality of their detention, the right to be informed of the grounds of arrest, the [[right to counsel]], and the right to be produced before a magistrate within 48 hours of arrest. These rights do not apply to [[enemy alien]]s or to persons arrested for [[Parliament of Singapore#Powers|contempt of Parliament]]. The Constitution also specifically exempts the [[Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Singapore)|Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act]] ({{Singapore legislation|cap=67|ed=2000}}), the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]] ({{Singapore legislation|cap=143|ed=1985}}), and Part IV of the [[Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|Misuse of Drugs Act]] ({{Singapore legislation|cap=185|ed=2008}}) from having to comply with Article 9.

==Text of Article 9==
Article 9 of the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution of the Republic of Singapore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|rep=1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; guarantees to all persons the [[right to life]] and [[political freedom|right to personal liberty]]. It states:

{{quote|9.— (1) No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.

(2) Where a complaint is made to the High Court or any Judge thereof that a person is being unlawfully detained, the Court shall inquire into the complaint and, unless satisfied that the detention is lawful, shall order him to be produced before the Court and release him.

(3) Where a person is arrested, he shall be informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest and shall be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice.

(4) Where a person is arrested and not released, he shall, without unreasonable delay, and in any case within 48 hours (excluding the time of any necessary journey), be produced before a Magistrate, in person or by way of video-conferencing link (or other similar technology) in accordance with law, and shall not be further detained in custody without the Magistrate's authority.

(5) Clauses (3) and (4) shall not apply to an enemy alien or to any person arrested for contempt of Parliament pursuant to a warrant issued under the hand of the Speaker.

(6) Nothing in this Article shall invalidate any law —

:(a) in force before the commencement of this Constitution which authorises the arrest and detention of any person in the interests of public safety, peace and good order; or
:(b) relating to the misuse of drugs or intoxicating substances which authorises the arrest and detention of any person for the purpose of treatment and rehabilitation,

by reason of such law being inconsistent with clauses (3) and (4), and, in particular, nothing in this Article shall affect the validity or operation of any such law before {{sic|10|th|hide=y}} March 1978.}}

Article 9(1) embodies the concept of the [[rule of law]], an early expression of which was the 39th article of the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215: "No [[wikt:freeman#Noun|freeman]] shall be taken captive or imprisoned, or deprived of his lands, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any way destroyed, nor will we go with force against him nor send forces against him, except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the [[law of the land]]."&lt;ref&gt;The version in force in the UK is Article 29 of the Magna Carta reissued by [[Edward I of England]] in 1297, which reads: "No Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be [[wikt:disseisin|disseised]] of his [[Freehold (English law)|Freehold]], or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.": Magna Carta 1297 ([http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517519 1297 c. 9]).&lt;/ref&gt; Article 9(1) is similar, but by no means identical, to the Due Process Clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which prohibits any state from denying "any person of life, liberty, or property, without [[due process]] of law", and to Article 21 of the [[Constitution of India]] which states: "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law." Article 5(1) of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]] and Singapore's Article 9(1) are worded the same way as the latter was adopted in 1965 from the former following [[history of the Republic of Singapore#Independence of Singapore|Singapore's independence from Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Republic of Singapore Independence Act}}, s. 6(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights to life and personal liberty==

===Meaning of ''life''===
[[File:Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Reprint).jpg|thumb|Article 9(1) in the 1999 Reprint of the [[Constitution of Singapore]], which prohibits the deprivation of life or personal liberty save in accordance with law]]

In ''[[Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (2010),&lt;ref name="Yong Vui Kong"&gt;''[[Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor]]'' [2010] 3 S.L.R. [''Singapore Law Reports''] 489, [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore]] called the [[right to life]] "the most basic of human rights".&lt;ref name="Yong Vui Kong 84"&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'', p. 528, para. 84. This case is elaborated upon in the "[[#Meaning of save in accordance with law|Meaning of ''save in accordance with law'']]" section below.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the courts have not yet had the opportunity to define the term ''life'' in Article 9(1).

Jurisdictions such as India, Malaysia and the United States interpret the same term in their respective constitutions broadly. In the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[Munn v. Illinois]]'' (1877),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Munn v. Illinois]]'' {{ussc|94|113|1877}}, [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] (United States).&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Stephen Johnson Field]] stated that the term ''life'' means more than mere animal existence. Rather, the definition extends to all those limbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed. His rationale was that the term should not be "construed in any narrow or restricted sense".&lt;ref&gt;''Munn'', p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Indian courts have likewise adopted a broad interpretation of ''life'' in Article 21 of the Indian Constitution to mean more than mere existence – instead, it includes the right to livelihood&lt;ref&gt;''Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corp.'' A.I.R. 1986 S.C. 180, [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] (India); and ''Delhi Transport Corp. v. D.T.C. Mazdoor Congress'' A.I.R. 1991 S.C. 101, S.C. (India).&lt;/ref&gt; and the right to a healthy environment. Subsequently, in ''Samatha v. State of Andhra Pradesh'' (1997),&lt;ref&gt;''Samatha v. State of Andhra Pradesh'' A.I.R. 1997 S.C. 3297, S.C. (India).&lt;/ref&gt; the meaning of ''life'' was expanded to include the right to live with human dignity; and to the provision of minimum sustenance, shelter, and those other rights and aspects of life that make life meaningful and worth living. Similarly, Justice [[Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati]] held in ''Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India'' (1984)&lt;ref&gt;''Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India'' A.I.R. 1984 S.C. 802, S.C. (India).&lt;/ref&gt; that the expression ''life'' included the right to be free from exploitation, and to the basic essentials of life included in the [[Directive Principles in India|Directive Principles of State Policy]] that appear in the Indian Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Bandhua Mukti Morcha'', pp. 811–812.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Malaysian case ''[[Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan &amp; Another|Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan]]'' (1996),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan &amp; Another|Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan]]'' [1996] 1 M.L.J. 261, [[Court of Appeal of Malaysia|Court of Appeal]] (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; the appellant had appealed against his [[wrongful dismissal]] from employment on the grounds of procedural unfairness. One of the issues brought up was whether an unfair procedure meant that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to life or liberty protected by Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram held that the courts should take into consideration the unique characteristics and situation of the country, and must not be blind to the realities of life.&lt;ref name="Tan Tek Seng, p. 288"&gt;''Tan Tek Seng'', p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to suggest that a liberal approach be adopted to grasp the intention of the framers of the Constitution by giving ''life'' a broad and liberal meaning. He opined that such an interpretation would include elements that form the quality of life, namely the right to seek and be engaged in lawful and gainful employment,&lt;ref&gt;The court in ''Tan Tek Seng'' cited [[Chief Justice of India|Chief Justice]] [[Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud]] in ''Olga Tellis'' who stated at p. 193: "An equally important facet of that right is the right to livelihood because, no person can live without the means of living, that is, the means of livelihood. If the right to livelihood is not treated as a part of the constitutional right to life, the easiest way of depriving a person of his right to life would be to deprive him of his means of livelihood to the point of abrogation." See ''Tan Tek Seng'', p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; and the right to live in a reasonably healthy and pollution-free environment.&lt;ref name="Tan Tek Seng, p. 288"/&gt; He also noted that life cannot be extinguished or taken away except according to procedure established by law.&lt;ref&gt;''Tan Tek Seng'', p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Yong Vui Kong'' case suggests that Singapore courts may interpret the word ''life'' more narrowly than the Indian and Malaysian courts when called upon to do so. The Court of Appeal stated that the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution had been expanded by the Indian courts to include "numerous rights relating to life, such as the right to education, the right to health and medical care and the right to freedom from noise pollution", attributing this to the "pro-active approach of the Indian Supreme Court in matters relating to the social and economic conditions of the people of India".&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (2010), p. 528, para. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court declined to apply ''Mithu v. State of Punjab'',&lt;ref&gt;''Mithu v. State of Punjab'' A.I.R. 1983 S.C. 473, S.C. (India).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the mandatory death penalty had been found unconstitutional, stating it was "not possible" to interpret Singapore's Article 9(1) in the way that the Indian Supreme Court had interpreted Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.&lt;ref name="Yong Vui Kong 84"/&gt;

===Meaning of ''personal liberty''===
''Lo Pui Sang v. Mamata Kapildev Dave'' (2008)&lt;ref&gt;''Lo Pui Sang v. Mamata Kapildev Dave'' [2008] 4 S.L.R.(R.) [''Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)''] 754, [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; took a narrow approach to the reading of ''personal liberty'' in Article 9(1). The [[High Court of Singapore]] held that ''personal liberty'' only refers to freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention, and does not include a liberty to contract. Although it was suggested this had always been the understanding of the term, no authority was cited.&lt;ref&gt;''Lo Pui Sang'', p. 760, para. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach taken in ''Lo Pui Sang'' can be compared to the more liberal interpretation of ''liberty'' in the United States and Malaysia. In the US Supreme Court case of ''[[Allgeyer v. Louisiana]]'' (1897),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Allgeyer v. Louisiana]]'' {{ussc|165|578|1897}}, S.C. (United States).&lt;/ref&gt; where a Louisiana statute was struck down on the ground that it violated an individual's right to contract, it was held that ''liberty'' in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution meant not only the right of the citizen to be free from any physical restraint of his person, but also the right to freely enjoy all his faculties – that is, to be free to use them in all lawful ways; to live and work where he will; to earn his livelihood by any lawful calling; to pursue any livelihood or avocation; and for that purpose to enter into all contracts that may be proper, necessary, and essential to his carrying out those purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''Allgeyer'', p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Liberty'' was accorded the same broad reading in the subsequent case ''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'' (1923),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'' {{ussc|262|390|1923}}, S.C. (United States).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Supreme Court held that a state statute mandating that English be the only language used in schools was unconstitutional as it infringed on the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court stated that ''liberty''

{{quote|... denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.&lt;ref&gt;''Meyer'', p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was held in the Malaysian Court of Appeal case of ''Sugumar Balakrishnan v. Pengarah Imigresen Negeri Sabah'' (1998)&lt;ref&gt;''Sugumar Balakrishnan v. Pengarah Imigresen Negeri Sabah'' [1998] 3 M.L.J. 289, C.A. (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; that the term ''life'' in Article 5(1) of the Constitution is not limited to mere existence, but is a wide concept that must receive a broad and liberal interpretation. Likewise, ''personal liberty'' should be similarly interpreted, as any other approach to construction will necessarily produce an incongruous and absurd result.&lt;ref&gt;''Sugumar'', p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; On the facts, personal liberty extended to the liberty of an aggrieved person to go to court and seek judicial review, and thus a statutory provision that sought to oust the power of judicial review was apparently inconsistent with this fundamental liberty. However, the apparent inconsistency could be resolved by permitting an [[ouster clause]] to immunize from judicial review only those administrative acts and decisions that are not infected by an error of law.&lt;ref&gt;''Sugumar'', p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Federal Court]] reversed the Court of Appeal on this point,&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Pihak Berkuasa Negeri Sabah v. Sugumar Balakrishnan &amp; Another|Pihak Berkuasa Negeri Sabah v. Sugumar Balakrishnan]]'' [2002] 3 M.L.J. 72, [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Federal Court]], Malaysia.&lt;/ref&gt; in the subsequent case ''[[Lee Kwan Woh v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (2009)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lee Kwan Woh v. Public Prosecutor]]'' [2009] 5 M.L.J. 301, F.C. (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; the Federal Court held that the provisions of the Constitution should be interpreted "generously and liberally", and that "on no account should a literal construction be placed on its language, particularly upon those provisions that guarantee to individuals the protection of fundamental rights".&lt;ref name="Lee Kwan Woh 8"&gt;''Lee Kwan Woh'', p. 311, para. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In its view:

{{quote|... it is the duty of a court to adopt a prismatic approach when interpreting the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part II of the Constitution. When light passes through a prism it reveals its constituent colours. In the same way, the prismatic approach will reveal to the court the rights submerged in the concepts employed by the several provisions under Part II.&lt;ref name="Lee Kwan Woh 8"/&gt;}}

The Federal Court went on to state that ''personal liberty'' "includes other rights" such as the right to "cross the frontiers in order to enter or leave the country when one so desires".&lt;ref&gt;''Lee Kwan Woh'', p. 314, para. 14, citing ''Government of Malaysia v. Loh Wai Kong'' [1978] 2 M.L.J. 175 at 178, H.C. (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that since Article 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution is pitched at a high level of generality,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jack Lee Tsen-Ta|title=Rediscovering the Constitution|url=http://works.bepress.com/jacklee/8/|journal=Singapore Law Review|year=1995|volume=16|pages=157–211 at 190}}.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no limitation in the ordinary natural meaning of the phrase. Thus, there is no requirement in the Constitution for ''personal liberty'' to be construed narrowly to mean only freedom from physical restraint.&lt;ref name="Ong Ah Chuan"&gt;Lee, p. 191. Lee notes at p. 190 that in ''[[Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor]]'' [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1980/1980_32.html &amp;#91;1980&amp;#93; UKPC 32], [1981] A.C. 648, [1979–1980] S.L.R.(R.) 710, [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] (on appeal from Singapore), [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Lord Diplock]] indicated that the Constitution should not be treated as ordinary legislation but as "''[[sui generis]]'', calling for principles of interpretation of its own, suitable to its character": ''Ong Ah Chuan'' [1979–1980] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 721, para. 23, citing ''Minister of Home Affairs v. Fisher'' [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1979/1979_21.html &amp;#91;1979&amp;#93; UKPC 21], [1980] A.C. 319 at 329, P.C. (on appeal from Bermuda).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning of ''save in accordance with law''===
The meaning of the word ''law'' in Article 9(1) has a direct bearing on the scope of the Article. If ''law'' is read broadly (for example, as incorporating [[customary international law]] principles), the scope of the fundamental liberties would be wider. It would be narrower if, on the other hand, ''law'' is construed narrowly, as the Legislature would be able to curtail such rights through legislation more easily. This could lead to a watering-down of the emphasis on fundamental liberties, as any infringement might be considered legitimate so long as the statute in question was validly enacted.

====Fundamental rules of natural justice====
[[File:Downing Street.jpg|thumb|400px|Up to October 2009, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] met at Downing Street ''(pictured)'' in the Council Chamber. In a 1980 case on appeal from [[Singapore]], the Privy Council held that the term ''law'' in provisions of the [[Constitution of Singapore|Singapore Constitution]] such as Article 9 included fundamental rules of [[natural justice]].]]

In the Malaysian case ''Arumugam Pillai v. Government of Malaysia'' (1976),&lt;ref&gt;''Arumugam Pillai v. Government of Malaysia'' [1975] 2 M.L.J. 29, F.C. (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Federal Court]] construed the phrase ''save in accordance with law'' in Article 13(1) of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]] restrictively. This provision states: "No person shall be deprived of property save in accordance with law." The Court held that all that was required for the legislation in question to be constitutional was for it to have been validly passed by Parliament. Hence, the validity of any duly enacted piece of legislation could not be questioned on grounds of reasonableness, no matter how arbitrary the law appeared to be.&lt;ref&gt;''Arumugam Pillai'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1980 the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] rejected this interpretation in the case of ''[[Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor]]'',&lt;ref name="Ong Ah Chuan"/&gt; a decision on appeal from Singapore. This appeal questioned the constitutional validity of section 15 of the [[Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|Misuse of Drugs Act]],&lt;ref name=MDA&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Misuse of Drugs Act|titlelink=Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|cap=185|ed=2008}} ("MDA").&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the issues that had to be decided was the interpretation of the word ''law'' in Article 9(1). The Public Prosecutor contended that ''law'' should be given a narrow meaning. He argued that

{{quote|since 'written law' is defined in Art 2(1) to mean 'this Constitution and all Acts and Ordinances and subsidiary legislation for the time being in force in Singapore' and 'law' is defined as including 'written law', the requirements of the Constitution are satisfied if the deprivation of life and liberty has been carried out in accordance with provisions contained in any Act passed by the [[Parliament of Singapore]], however arbitrary or contrary to fundamental rules of natural justice the provisions of such Act may be.&lt;ref name="Ong Ah Chuan 24"&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', [1981] 1 A.C. at p. 670, [1979-1980] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 721, para. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the Public Prosecutor qualified the statement by providing a limitation, namely, that "the arbitrariness, the disregard of fundamental rules of natural justice for which the Act provides, must be of general application to all citizens of Singapore so as to avoid falling foul of the anti-discriminatory provisions of [[Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore|Art 12(1)]]".&lt;ref name="Ong Ah Chuan 24"/&gt;

In a judgment delivered by Lord Diplock, the Privy Council rejected this interpretation, finding the Public Prosecutor's argument fallacious. Reading the definition of ''written law'' as stated in Article 2(1) together with Article 4, which provides that "any law enacted by the Legislature after the commencement of this Constitution which is inconsistent with this Constitution shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void", their Lordships held that "the use of the expression 'law' in Art 9(1) ... does not, in the event of challenge, relieve the court of its duty to determine whether the provisions of an Act of Parliament passed after 16 September 1963 and relied upon to justify depriving a person of his life or liberty are inconsistent with the Constitution and consequently void".&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', [1981] 1 A.C. at p. 670, [1979-1980] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 722, para. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with their view that Part IV of the Constitution should be given "a generous interpretation ... suitable to give to individuals the full measure of the
[fundamental liberties] referred to",&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', [1981] 1 A.C. at p. 670, [1979-1980] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 721, para. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; their Lordships held that "references to 'law' in such contexts as 'in accordance with law', 'equality before the law', 'protection of the law' and the like ... refer to a system of law which incorporates those fundamental rules of natural justice that had formed part and parcel of the common law of England that was in operation in Singapore at the commencement of the Constitution".&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', [1981] 1 A.C. at p. 670, [1979-1980] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 722, para. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; This conception of the meaning of ''law'' in Article 9(1) has been affirmed by the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] in ''Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor'' (2005)&lt;ref&gt;''Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20101115085712/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/rss/judg/46431.html &amp;#91;2004&amp;#93; SGCA 47], [2005] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 103 at 125, para. 82, C.A. (Singapore), archived from [http://www.singaporelaw.sg/rss/judg/46431.html the original] on 15 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (2010), pp. 499–500, para. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been highlighted that this elevation of principles of [[natural justice]] to constitutional status, with the implication that they may override local statutes due to the supremacy of the Constitution over them, creates some tension with Article 38 which vests the law-making power of Singapore in the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=C.L. Lim|title=The Constitution and the Reception of Customary International Law: ''Nguyen Tuong Van v Public Prosecutor''|ssrn=952611|journal=Singapore Journal of Legal Studies|year=2005|volume=1|pages=218–233 at 229}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Extent of natural justice=====
In ''Ong Ah Chuan'' and the subsequent decision ''[[Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (1981),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor]]'' [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1981/1981_23.html &amp;#91;1981&amp;#93; UKPC 23], [1982] A.C. 136, [1981–1982] S.L.R.(R.) 133, P.C. (on appeal from Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; the Privy Council declined to set out a comprehensive list of fundamental rules of [[natural justice]] and merely stated some principles to deal with the issues at hand. At a 2000 conference, the [[Attorney-General of Singapore|Attorney-General]] [[Chan Sek Keong]], who became [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] in 2006, remarked that this gives the Court of Appeal a free hand to determine the scope of the fundamental rules of natural justice unencumbered by [[precedent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Chan Sek Keong |authorlink=Chan Sek Keong |contribution=Rethinking the Criminal Justice System of Singapore for the 21st Century |url=http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/Data/Files/File/Speeches/RethinkingCriminalJusticeSystem.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uViu4266?url=http://app.subcourts.gov.sg/Data/Files/File/Speeches/RethinkingCriminalJusticeSystem.pdf |archivedate=25 November 2010 |editor=Singapore Academy of Law |editor-link=Singapore Academy of Law |title=The Singapore Conference: Leading the Law and Lawyers into the New Millennium @ 2020 |location=Singapore |publisher=[[LexisNexis|Butterworths Asia]] |year=2000 |pages=29–58 at 39–40 |isbn=978-981-236-106-6 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guidance as to the scope of fundamental rules of natural justice was provided in ''Haw Tua Tau''. First, the Privy Council said that rules of natural justice are not stagnant and may change with the times. Secondly, they should be considered in the local context, in light of the entire system as a whole and from the perspective of the people operating the system.&lt;ref&gt;''Haw Tua Tau'', [1982] A.C. at p. 154, [1981–1982] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 144, paras. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in order to satisfy the rules of natural justice, the law in question should not be "obviously unfair".&lt;ref&gt;''Haw Tua Tau'', [1982] A.C. at p. 148, [1981–1982] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 137, para. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In its view, under a system of justice in which the court is invested with partly [[inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]] functions, compelling an accused to answer questions put to him by a judge cannot be regarded as contrary to natural justice.&lt;ref&gt;''Haw Tua Tau'', [1982] A.C. at p. 154, [1981–1982] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 144, para. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Appeal later ruled in ''Public Prosecutor v. Mazlan bin Maidun'' (1992)&lt;ref&gt;''Public Prosecutor v. Mazlan bin Maidun'' [1992] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 968, C.A. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[privilege (evidence)|privilege]] against [[self-incrimination]] was not a fundamental rule of natural justice, and thus not a constitutional right.

In ''[[Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General]]'' (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General|link=Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General|court=SGCA|year=2011|num=9|parallelcite=[2011] 2 S.L.R. 1189|courtname=C.A.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal stated that fundamental rules of natural justice embodied in the concept of ''law'' in constitutional provisions such as Articles 9(1) and 12(1) are the same in nature and function as [[common law]] rules of natural justice in [[administrative law in Singapore|administrative law]], except that they operate at different levels of the legal order. The former invalidate legislation on the ground of unconstitutionality and can only be altered by amending the Constitution, while the latter invalidate administrative decisions on the ground of administrative law principles and can be abrogated or disapplied by ordinary legislation.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (2011), pp. 1242–1243, paras. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====A procedural or substantive concept?=====
Traditionally, at common law, natural justice is taken to be a procedural concept that embodies the twin pillars of ''[[audi alteram partem]]'' (hear the other party) and ''[[nemo iudex in causa sua]]'' (no one should be a judge in his or her own cause). In the United States, [[due process]] has both procedural and substantive components. [[Substantive due process]] involves the courts assessing the reasonableness of executive actions and legislation using [[rational basis review]] if a fundamental right is not implicated and [[strict scrutiny]] if it is. The question thus arises whether substantive fundamental rules of natural justice may be developed by local courts. However, a line of Malaysian cases has expressed the view that the concept of substantive due process is not applicable to Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1).&lt;ref&gt;See ''Public Prosecutor v. Datuk Harun bin Haji Idris'' [1976] 2 M.L.J. 116, [[High Courts of Malaysia|High Court]] (Kuala Lumpur); ''Attorney-General, Malaysia v. Chiow Thiam Guan'' [1983] 1 M.L.J. 51, H.C.

(Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; There is also academic commentary that rejects the notion of "substantive natural justice", arguing that it is too vague and leads to problems in application.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=A[ndrew] J. Harding|title=Natural Justice and the Constitution|journal=Malaya Law Review|year=1981|volume=23|pages=226–236}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another argument against substantive natural justice is the fear that it may become an avenue for judges to invalidate laws on the basis of their own subjective opinions, leading to unbounded [[judicial activism]].

On the other hand, it has also been suggested that substantive natural justice would merely be a full exercise of the judiciary's proper role as conferred by the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jack Lee Tsen-Ta|title=Rediscovering the Constitution|url=http://works.bepress.com/jacklee/8/|journal=Singapore Law Review|year=1995|volume=16|pages=157–211 at 201}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, one scholar has asserted that there is no doubt that a judicial inquiry covers both substantive and procedural aspects. It is said that Article 9(1) connotes a judicial inquiry into the "fairness" of the law tested against certain principles regarded as fundamental to the legal system. Distinguishing between substantive and procedural fairness is a meaningless exercise, as it merely clouds the process of judicial inquiry. Judicial review is judicial review under whatever name, and as far as Article 9(1) is concerned, there is no room for making this distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=T.K.K. Iyer|title=Article 9(1) and 'Fundamental Principles of Natural Justice' in the Constitution of Singapore|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/sjls23&amp;div=25|journal=Malaya Law Review|year=1981|volume=23|pages=213–225 at 224–225}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in ''Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor'' (2010)&lt;ref name="Yong Vui Kong"/&gt; the Court of Appeal appeared to reject such an approach by declining to require that procedural laws must be "fair, just and reasonable"&lt;ref&gt;The approach taken to Article 21 of the Indian Constitution in ''Mithu'', para. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; before they can be regarded as ''law'' for the purpose of Article 9(1). It noted that the provision neither contains such a qualification, nor can such a qualification be implied from its context or wording. The Court considered it "too vague a test of constitutionality" and said: "Such a test hinges on the court’s view of the reasonableness of the law in question, and requires the court to intrude into the legislative sphere of Parliament as well as engage in policy making."&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (2010), pp. 526–527, para. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the Court acknowledged that Article 9(1) does not justify all legislation whatever its nature.&lt;ref&gt;Citing ''Ong Ah Chuan'', [1980] A.C. at 659.&lt;/ref&gt; It held, ''[[obiter dictum|obiter]]'', that ''law'' might not encompass [[wikt:colourable#Adjective|colourable]] legislation (that is, [[bill of attainder|bills of attainder]] – legislation purporting to be of general application but in fact directed at securing the conviction of particular individuals), or legislation "of so absurd or arbitrary a nature that it could not possibly have been contemplated by our constitutional framers as being 'law' when they crafted the constitutional provisions protecting fundamental liberties".&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (2010), p. 500, para. 16; see also pp. 524–525, para. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Customary international law====
[[File:UN General Assembly.jpg|thumb|The [[United Nations General Assembly]] hall in New York. The [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Singapore Court of Appeal]] acknowledged in a 2004 case that Article 5 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted by the General Assembly in 1948, prohibits [[torture]] and cruel and inhumane treatment, and that this is considered [[customary international law]]. However, what constitutes "cruel and inhumane treatment" remains unclear.]]

In ''Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor'' (2004), the Court of Appeal considered whether ''law'' in Article 9(1) includes principles of [[customary international law]]. In that case, the appellant argued that effecting a death sentence for drug trafficking by [[hanging]] is unconstitutional as a form of [[cruel and unusual punishment|cruel and inhuman punishment]] not "in accordance with law". The Court agreed that there was a prohibition against [[torture]] and cruel and inhumane treatment in Article 5 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and that this is considered customary international law. However, a customary international law rule had to be "clearly and firmly established" before it was adopted by the courts,&lt;ref&gt;''Nguyen Tuong Van'', pp. 126–127, para. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; and there was insufficient practice among states to hold that death by hanging was within the ambit of this prohibition. Also, even if there was a customary international law rule against death by hanging, domestic statutes would prevail in the event of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;''Nguyen Tuong Van'', p. 128, para. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of Appeal clarified in ''Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor'' (2010),&lt;ref name="Yong Vui Kong"/&gt; that customary international law cannot be read into the Constitution for two reasons. First, in order for a customary international law rule to have legal effect in Singapore, it has to be incorporated into [[municipal law|domestic law]]. The incorporation can occur either by enactment in a statute&lt;ref name="Yong Vui Kong 89"&gt;In which case the rule will be regarded as part of domestic legislation and no longer a customary international law rule: ''Yong Vui Kong'' (2010), p. 530, para. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; or by a court declaration that the rule forms part of the common law.&lt;ref name="Yong Vui Kong 89"/&gt; The Court felt it would be incorrect to incorporate customary international law rules into the meaning of ''law'' in Article 9(1) as this would cloak the common law with the constitutional status to nullify a statute, thus reversing the usual hierarchy of legal rules.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (2010), p. 530, para. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the term ''law'' is defined in Article 2(1) to include the common law only "in so far as it is in operation in Singapore". However, a court cannot treat rules of customary international law as having been incorporated into Singapore common law if they are inconsistent with existing statutes. Furthermore, if there is a conflict between such a rule and a domestic statute, the latter prevails.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (2010), p. 531, para. 91; {{citation|author=Thio Li-ann|authorlink=Thio Li-ann|title='It is a Little Known Legal Fact': Originalism, Customary Human Rights Law and Constitutional Interpretation: ''Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor''|ssrn=1802666|journal=Singapore Journal of Legal Studies|year=2010|pages=558–570 at 568–569}}. The Court of Appeal also held that since a significant number of nations still retain the mandatory death penalty for drug-related offences and other serious crimes, it had not been established that customary international law prohibited the imposition of the mandatory death penalty: ''Yong Vui Kong'' (2010), p. 533, para. 96. Further, a customary international law rule prohibiting the mandatory death penalty cannot be regarded as part of ''law'' in Article 9(1) of the Constitution because the [[Government of Singapore]] rejected a recommendation to include a prohibition against inhuman punishment in the Constitution in 1966: p. 531, para. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitution is silent as to the reception of [[international law]] in domestic law.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Li-ann Thio|authorlink=Thio Li-ann|title=The Death Penalty as Cruel and Inhuman Punishment before the Singapore High Court?: Customary Human Rights Norms, Constitutional Formalism and the Supremacy of Domestic Law in ''Public Prosecutor v Nguyen Tuong Van'' (2004)|journal=[[Oxford University Commonwealth Law Journal]]|year=2004|volume=4|issue=2|pages=213–226 at 223}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Yong Vui Kong'' the Court of Appeal accepted that domestic law, including the Constitution, should "as far as possible" be consistently interpreted with Singapore's international obligations. Nonetheless, while international human rights law can increase the normative pool judges may resort to in interpreting the Constitution, there are "inherent limits" such as the express wording of the constitutional text and constitutional history that "[militates] against the incorporation of those international norms".&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (2010), p. 519, para. 59; Thio, "Little Known Legal Fact", p. 569.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that although where possible local statutes should be interpreted in light of international treaties, it is not the role of the judiciary to import international law standards into the Constitution that are inconsistent with legislation instead of [[judicial deference|deferring]] to the views of the [[executive (government)|executive]]. According to this view, which hinges on a strict adherence to the [[separation of powers in Singapore|separation of powers]] doctrine, the judiciary should guard against unwarranted incursions into the executive sphere, as it is for the executive to determine Singapore's attitude and position in relation to foreign affairs. The judiciary must not undertake its task of interpreting the Constitution arbitrarily, but should accord with legal reasoning and sound principles.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "The Constitution and the Reception of Customary International Law", p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; This necessarily raises the question of what the applicable legal principle during the interpretation process should be. It has been suggested that the executive and the judiciary should show solidarity by speaking with "one voice",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=C.L. Lim |title=Public International Law before the Singapore and Malaysian Courts |journal=Singapore Year Book of International Law |url=http://law.nus.edu.sg/sybil/downloads/articles/SYBIL-2004/SYBIL-2004-243.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uYgsk8Fk?url=http://law.nus.edu.sg/sybil/downloads/articles/SYBIL-2004/SYBIL-2004-243.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2010 |year=2004 |volume=8 |pages=243–281 at 272 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the courts should exercise deference in favour of what the executive deems to be the nation's attitude towards the particular international law norm that is sought to be applied.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "The Constitution and the Reception of Customary International Law", p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be submitted that such judicial deference to the executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, it is crucial that the court should not merely rely on international law to determine the meaning of the liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "The Constitution and the Reception of Customary International Law", p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

===Right to life===

====Abortion====
One of the most difficult questions involving the right to life is when exactly life begins and ends. If an unborn child is treated as a living person, then it should be accorded the right to life under the Constitution. Laws permitting [[abortion]] would thus be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, see {{citation|author=Dawn Tan|title=Christian Reflections on Universal Human Rights and Religious Values: Uneasy Bedfellows?|journal=Singapore Law Review|year=1997|volume=18|pages=216–250 at 220|quote=Since the advent of the modern human rights movement, the term 'human rights' has been bandied about with great fervour by its proponents; often, persons on opposite sides of an argument are able to defend their position by talking in terms of rights. For instance, abortion is condemned in the name of the foetus's right to life; the outlawing of abortion, in the name of the mother's right to choose – a women's right.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue has yet to come before the Singapore courts.

In Singapore, the [[Penal Code (Singapore)|Penal Code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Penal Code|titlelink=Penal Code (Singapore)|cap=224|ed=2008}}, ss. 313–316.&lt;/ref&gt; lays out sanctions for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Termination of Pregnancy Act|cap=324|ed=1985}} ("TPA").&lt;/ref&gt; which limits abortion to women who have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;TPA, s. 4(a). Compare the Malaysian Penal Code (Act 574, 2006 Rev. Ed.), s. 312, which states that abortion is permissible within 120 days of conception only if the pregnancy poses a threat to an expectant mother's physical or mental health: see {{citation|author=Ahmad Mesum|title=An Overview of the Right to Life under the Malaysian Federal Constitution|journal=Malayan Law Journal|year=2008|volume=6|pages=xxxiv–xlix at xxxiv–xlviii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By not conferring the right to life upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Constitution]] provides that the state shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of the Philippines]], Art. II, s. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms]] of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms]] 1992 (Czech Republic), Art. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.

====Right to die====
In Singapore, [[failed suicide attempt|attempted suicide]],&lt;ref&gt;Penal Code, s. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; abetment of suicide, and abetment of attempted suicide&lt;ref&gt;Penal Code, s. 309 read with s. 107 (abetment); and s. 306 (abetment of suicide).&lt;/ref&gt; are criminal acts. This applies to physicians who aid patients in ending their lives. Such physicians are unable to claim a defence under section 88 of the Penal Code since they intended to cause the patients' deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Penal Code, s. 88, reads: "Nothing, ''which is not intended to cause death'', is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent." (Emphasis added.)&lt;/ref&gt; However, physicians are absolved of liability if patients refuse treatment for [[terminal illness]]es by issuing [[advance health care directive|advance medical directives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Advance Medical Directive Act|cap=4A|ed=1997}}, s. 20(1). Nothing in the Act authorizes an act that causes or accelerates death as distinct from an act that permits the dying process to take its natural course; or condones, authorizes or approves abetment of suicide or [[euthanasia]]: s. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the right to life guaranteed by Article 9(1) encompasses a [[right to die]] – that is, a right to commit suicide or a right to [[assisted suicide]], usually in the face of a terminal illness – has not been the subject of any Singapore court case. In other jurisdictions, the [[right to life]] has generally not been interpreted in this way. In ''Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab'' (1996)&lt;ref&gt;''Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab'' A.I.R. 1996 S.C. 1257, S.C. (India).&lt;/ref&gt; the Indian Supreme Court held that the right to life is a natural right embodied in Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, and since suicide is an unnatural termination or extinction of life it is incompatible and inconsistent with the concept of the right to life.&lt;ref&gt;''Gian Kaur'', para. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The US Supreme Court has also declined to recognize that choosing death is a right protected by the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. In ''[[Washington v. Glucksberg]]'' (1997),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Washington v. Glucksberg]]'' {{ussc|521|702|1997}}, S.C. (United States).&lt;/ref&gt; a group of Washington residents asserted that a state law banning assisted suicide&lt;ref&gt;[[Revised Code of Washington|Wash. Rev. Code]] Ann. §9A.36.060(1): "A person is guilty of promoting a suicide attempt when he knowingly causes or aids another person to attempt suicide."&lt;/ref&gt; was unconstitutional on its face. The majority held that as assisted suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the [[due process]] clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Several of the justices seemed persuaded that the availability of [[palliative care]] to "alleviate suffering, even to the point of causing unconsciousness and hastening death"&lt;ref&gt;''Glucksberg'', p. 737.&lt;/ref&gt; outweighed recognizing a new [[unenumerated rights|unenumerated]] "right to commit suicide which itself includes a right to assistance in doing so".&lt;ref&gt;''Glucksberg'', p. 723.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to personal liberty===

====Rights of arrested persons====
[[File:Changi Prison, Singapore.jpg|thumb|The Prison Link Centre, the gateway to the [[Changi Prison|Changi Prison Complex]]. Article 9 provides that arrested persons have a right to challenge the legality of their detention, to be informed of the grounds of their arrest, to [[right to counsel|consult counsel]], and to be produced before a magistrate within 48 hours of arrest.]]

Article 9(2) of the Constitution enshrines the right of persons who have been detained to apply to the High Court challenging the legality of their detention. The application is for an order for review of detention, which was formerly called a [[writ]] of ''[[habeas corpus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The application procedure is governed by Order 54 of the [http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/data/doc/ManagePage/97/eROC2006rev/eROC2006.htm Rules of Court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701223648/http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/data/doc/ManagePage/97/eROC2006rev/eROC2006.htm |date=1 July 2010 }} (Cap. 322, R 5, 2006 Rev. Ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court is required to inquire into the complaint, and order the detainee to be produced before the Court and released unless it is satisfied that the detention is lawful.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 9(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 9(3) requires that an arrested person be informed "as soon as may be" of the grounds of his arrest. Article 9(4) goes on to provide that if the arrested person is not released he must, without unreasonable delay, and in any case within 48 hours (excluding the time of any necessary journey) be produced before a magistrate and cannot be further detained in custody without the authority of the magistrate. The person's attendance before the magistrate may be in person or by way of [[videoconferencing|video-conferencing]] or other similar technology in accordance with law.

=====Right to counsel=====
Article 9(3) also states that an arrested person must be allowed to consult and be defended by a [[lawyers in Singapore|legal practitioner]] of his choice.

==Restrictions on the rights to life and personal liberty==
As mentioned [[#Meaning of save in accordance with law|above]], Parliament is entitled to restrict the rights to life and personal liberty as long as it acts "in accordance with law". More specific restrictions on Article 9 include Article 9(5), which provides that Articles 9(3) and (4) of the Constitution do not apply to [[enemy alien]]s or to persons arrested for [[Parliament of Singapore#Powers|contempt of Parliament]] pursuant to a [[warrant (law)|warrant]] issued by the [[Speaker of the Parliament of Singapore|Speaker]].

===Detention under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act and the Misuse of Drugs Act===
Article 9(6) saves any law
:(a) in force before the commencement of the Constitution authorizing the arrest and detention of any person in the interests of public safety, peace and good order; or
:(b) relating to the misuse of drugs or intoxicating substances which authorizes the arrest and detention of any person for treatment and [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]],
from being invalid because of inconsistency with Articles 9(3) and (4). This provision took effect on 10 March 1978 but was expressed to apply to laws in force prior to that date. Introduced by the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1978,&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution (Amendment) Act|no=5|year=1978|lk=off}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the provision immunizes the [[Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Singapore)|Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act
|titlelink=Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Singapore)|cap=67|ed=2000}} ("CLTPA").&lt;/ref&gt; and Part IV of the Misuse of Drugs Act&lt;ref name=MDA/&gt; from unconstitutionality.

[[Preventive detention]] is the use of executive power to detain individuals on the basis that they are predicted to commit future crimes that will threaten national interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Claire Macken|title=Preventive Detention and the Right to Personal Liberty and Security under Article 5 ECHR|journal=International Journal of Human Rights|year=2006|volume=10|issue=3|pages=195–217 at 196|doi=10.1080/13642980600828487}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act empowers the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Minister for Home Affairs]], if satisfied that a person has been associated with activities of a criminal nature, to order that he or she be detained for a period not exceeding 12 months if the Minister is of the view that the detention is necessary in the interests of public safety, peace and good order.&lt;ref&gt;CLTPA, s. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, the Director of the [[Central Narcotics Bureau]] may order [[drug addiction|drug addicts]] to undergo drug treatment or rehabilitation at an approved institution for renewable six-month periods up to a maximum of three years.&lt;ref&gt;MDA, s. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detention under the Internal Security Act===
Section 8(1) of Singapore's [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]] ("ISA")&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Internal Security Act|titlelink=Internal Security Act (Singapore)|cap=143|ed=1985}} ("ISA").&lt;/ref&gt; gives the Minister for Home Affairs the power to detain a person without trial for any period not exceeding two years on the precondition that the [[President of Singapore|President]] is: "satisfied ... that ... it is necessary to do so ... with a view to preventing that person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore ... or to the maintenance of public order or essential services therein". The period of detention may be renewed by the President indefinitely for periods not exceeding two years at a time as long as the grounds for detention continue to exist.&lt;ref&gt;ISA, s. 8(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISA has its constitutional basis in Article 149 of the Constitution, which sanctions preventive detention and allows for laws passed by the legislature against [[subversion]] to override the Articles protecting the personal liberties of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Yee Chee Wai|author2=Ho Tze Wei Monica|author3=Seng Kiat Boon Daniel|title=Judicial Review of Preventive Detention under the Internal Security Act – A Summary of Developments|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/singlrev10&amp;div=8|journal=Singapore Law Review|year=1989|volume=10|pages=66–103 at 74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Article 149(1) declares such legislation to be valid notwithstanding any inconsistency with five of the fundamental liberty provisions in the Constitution, including Article 9.&lt;ref&gt;The other provisions are Arts. 11, 12, 13 and 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, detentions under the ISA cannot be challenged on the basis of deprivation of these rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Eunice Chua|title=Reactions to Indefinite Preventive Detention: An Analysis of how the Singapore, United Kingdom and American Judiciary give Voice to the Law in the Face of (Counter) Terrorism|journal=Singapore Law Review|year=2007|volume=25|pages=3–23 at 6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5501">'''Assemblage theory''' is an ontological framework developed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], originally presented in their book ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980). Assemblage theory provides a bottom-up framework for analyzing social complexity by emphasizing fluidity, exchangeability, and multiple functionalities.&lt;ref name=UT2016&gt;Wikis.la.utexas.edu,. (2016). Assemblage Theory | University of Texas Theory. Retrieved 1 March 2016, from {{cite web|url=http://wikis.la.utexas.edu/theory/page/assemblage-theory |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314011817/http://wikis.la.utexas.edu/theory/page/assemblage-theory |archivedate=2016-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assemblage theory asserts that, within a body, the relationships of component parts are not stable and fixed; rather, they can be displaced and replaced within and among other bodies, thus approaching systems through relations of exteriority. &lt;ref name=UT2016 /&gt;

== Deleuze and Guattari, ''A Thousand Plateaus'' == 
In A Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari draw from [[dynamical systems theory]], which explores the way material systems self-organize, and extends the system to include that of the social, linguistic, and philosophical in order to create assemblage theory.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008&gt;Smith, D., &amp; Protevi, J. (2008). Gilles Deleuze. Plato.stanford.edu. Retrieved 1 March 2016, from http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/#ThoPla&lt;/ref&gt; In assemblage theory, assemblages are formed through the processes of coding, stratification, and territorialization.

Deleuze and Guatarri use the term “constellation” when they talk about assemblage. A constellation, like any assemblage, is made up of imaginative contingent articulations among myriad heterogeneous elements.&lt;ref name=SlackandWise&gt;Wise, J., &amp; Slack, J. (2014). Culture and Technology. New York, NY: Lang, Peter New York.&lt;/ref&gt; This process of ordering matter around a body is called coding.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008 /&gt; According to Deleuze and Guatarri, assemblages are coded by taking a particular form; they select, compose, and complete a territory. &lt;ref name=SlackandWise /&gt;

In composing a territory, there exists the creation of hierarchical bodies, in the process of stratification.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008 /&gt; Drawing from the constellation metaphor, Deleuze and Guattari argue that the constellation includes some heavenly bodies but leaves out others; the included bodies being those in close proximity given the particular gathering and angle of view. The example constellation thus defines the relationships with the bodies around it and the way the universe is viewed.

Territorialization is the final process of assemblage theory, and is viewed as the ordering of the coded and stratified bodies that create the “assemblage”.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008 /&gt;   Assemblages territorialize both forms of content and forms of expression. Forms of content, also known as material forms, include the assemblage of human and nonhuman bodies, actions, and reactions. Forms of expression include incorporeal enunciations, acts, and statements.&lt;ref name=SlackandWise /&gt; Within this form of territorialization, assemblages do not remain static; they are further characterized by processes of [[deterritorialization]] and reterritorialization. Deterritorialization occurs when articulations are disarticulated and disconnected.&lt;ref name=SlackandWise /&gt; Reterritorialization describes the process by which new articulations are forged, thus constituting a new assemblage.&lt;ref name=SlackandWise /&gt; In this way, these axes of content/expressive and the processes of territorialization exist to demonstrate the complex nature of  assemblages.

== DeLanda, ''A New Philosophy of Society'' == 
Philosopher [[Manuel DeLanda]] has adopted the concept of assemblage in his book ''[[A New Philosophy of Society]]'' (2006). In his book, DeLanda draws from Deleuze and Guattari to further argue that social bodies on all scales are best analyzed through their individual components. Like Deleuze and Guattari, DeLanda’s approach examines relations of exteriority, in which assemblage components are self-subsistent and retain autonomy outside of the assemblage in which they exist &lt;ref name=Karaman2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karaman | first1 = O | year = 2008 | title = A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory And Social Complexity by Manuel DeLanda | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8330.2008.00646.x | journal = Antipode | volume = 40 | issue = 5| pages = 935–937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DeLanda further expands upon Deleuze’s assemblage theory and relations of exteriority by suggesting that assemblage components are organized through the two axes of material/expressive and territorializing/deterritorializing.&lt;ref name=Karaman2008 /&gt; Further, a third axis exists of genetic/linguistic resources exists to define the interventions involved in the coding, decoding, and recoding of the assemblage.&lt;ref name=Karaman2008 /&gt; However, DeLanda further asserts that the social does not lose its reality, nor its materiality, through its complexity.&lt;ref name=UT2016 /&gt; In this way, assemblages are effective in their practicality; assemblages, though fluid, are nevertheless part of historically significant processes. In that way, DeLanda offers a reconfiguration of the Deleuzian concepts that provides a more robust theoretical framework for analyzing assemblages.

'''Barbara Smoker''' (born 2 June 1923) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Secular humanism|Humanist]] [[activist]] and [[freethought]] advocate. She is also a former President of the [[National Secular Society]] (1972–1996), former Chair of the British Voluntary Euthanasia Society (now known as [[Dignity in Dying]]) (1981–1985) and was an Honorary Vice President of the [[Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

== Biography ==
Barbara Smoker was born in [[London]] in 1923 into a [[Roman Catholic]] family. She served in the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] from 1942 to 1945 in southeast Asia. In 1949 she became an [[Atheism|atheist]],&lt;ref name="bed"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/in-bed-with-susan-de-muth-barbara-smoker--stranglers-in-the-night-1448717.html | title = In bed with Susan De Muth: Barbara Smoker / Stranglers in the night | accessdate = 2010-12-10 | date = 1994-09-14 | publisher = ''[[The Independent]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the writing of [[Hector Hawton]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;MacKillop, I. D. (1986) ''The British Ethical Societies'', p 86, Cambridge University Press, [online] Available from: https://books.google.com/books?id=mqgsFS_MN9UC&amp;pgis=1 (Accessed 13 May 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Managing Director of the [[Rationalist Press Association]] and editor of [[New Humanist|The Humanist]].

In 1950 Smoker joined the [[Secular Humanism|secular humanist movement]] when she became a member of the [[South Place Ethical Society]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; where she was critical of seeking redress on religious grounds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Eventually she became President of the [[National Secular Society]] for nearly 25 years (1972 &lt;ref name="pres"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://conwayhall.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ETHICAL-RECORD-JULY-AUGUST-1972.pdf | title = Kindred organisations, ''Ethical Record'', July/August 1972, p27 | accessdate = 2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;–1996). In that capacity, she represented the atheist viewpoint in print, on lecture platforms, speaking tours, on radio and television. 

She was in demand to give addresses at secular funerals&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and eventually officiated at non-religious funerals, wedding ceremonies, gay and lesbian commitments and baby namings. She was active in various social campaigns, such as the abolition of the [[Capital Punishment|death penalty]], [[nuclear disarmament]], [[legalization]] of [[abortion]] and for the [[Voluntary Euthanasia Society]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She claimed to have financed the manufacture of the first [[Make love, not war|Make Love, Not War]] badges that were popular in Britain during the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Barbara Smoker became the South Place Ethical Society's last and only female Appointed Lecturer in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;See image of the Appointed Lecturer Board at [[Conway Hall Ethical Society|Conway Hall]]&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2014, with the death of [[Harry Stopes-Roe|Dr Harry Stopes-Roe]], she became the only living Appointed Lecturer. In 2005 Barbara Smoker received the Distinguished Humanist Service Award from the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]. She is also an Honorary Member of [[Humanists UK]].

Smoker lives in southeast London and in 2012 was elected the Honorary life president of the South East London Humanist Group in recognition that she is its last surviving founder member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selondon.humanist.org.uk/index.php/aboutus/honorary-life-president |title=Honorary Life President |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324063425/http://www.selondon.humanist.org.uk/index.php/aboutus/honorary-life-president |archivedate=2014-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Panel on Climate Change|IPCC's]] 2014 [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|assessment report]], "Mitigation is a public good; climate change is a case of the '[[tragedy of the commons]]'. Effective climate change mitigation will not be achieved if each agent (individual, institution or country) acts independently in its own selfish interest (see [[International cooperation]] and [[Emissions trading]]), suggesting the need for collective action. Some [[climate change adaptation|adaptation]] actions, on the other hand, have characteristics of a private good as benefits of actions may accrue more directly to the individuals, regions, or countries that undertake them, at least in the short term. Nevertheless, financing such adaptive activities remains an issue, particularly for poor individuals and countries."&lt;ref name="AR5-WG3-Chap3"&gt;

One of the issues often discussed in relation to climate change mitigation is the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) has the ultimate objective of [[Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change|preventing "dangerous" anthropogenic (i.e., human) interference of the climate system]]. As is stated in Article 2 of the Convention, this requires that greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where [[climate change and ecosystems|ecosystems]] can adapt naturally to climate change, [[climate change and agriculture|food production]] is not threatened, and [[economics of global warming|economic development]] can proceed in a sustainable fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

There are a number of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. These include [[carbon dioxide]] ([[chemical formula]]: {{CO2}}), [[methane]] ({{chem|CH|4}}), [[nitrous oxide]] ({{chem|N|2|O}}), and a group of gases referred to as [[halocarbon]]s.

The reason for this is that human activities are adding CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the atmosphere faster than natural processes can remove it (see [[carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere]] for a complete explanation).&lt;ref name="meehl stabilizing ghg concentrations"/&gt; This is analogous to a flow of water into a bathtub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of the other greenhouse gasses humans emit also depends on how fast their emissions are added to the atmosphere, and how fast the GHGs are removed. Stabilization for these gases is described in the later section on [[#Non-CO2 greenhouse gases|non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; GHGs]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 2018 an international team of scientist published research saying that the current mitigation policy in [[Paris Agreement]] is insufficient to limit the temperature rise to 2 degrees. They say that even if all the current pledges will be accomplished there is a chance for a 4.5 degree temperature rise in decades.  To preventing that, restoration of natural [[Carbon sink]]s, [[Carbon dioxide removal]], changes in society and values will be necessary.&lt;ref name="Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steffen |first1=Will |last2=Rockström |first2=Johan |last3=Richardson |first3=Katherine |last4=M.

To create lasting climate change mitigation, the replacement of high carbon [[emission intensity]] power sources, such as conventional [[fossil fuel]]s—[[oil]], [[coal]], and [[natural gas]]—with [[low-carbon power]] sources is required. Fossil fuels supply humanity with the vast majority of our energy demands, and at a growing rate. In 2012 the IEA noted that coal accounted for half the increased energy use of the prior decade, growing faster than all renewable energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/English.pdf World energy outlook 2012 (IEA)]&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[hydroelectricity]] and [[nuclear power]] together provide the majority of the generated [[low-carbon power]] fraction of global total power consumption.

In general, higher consumption lifestyles have a greater environmental impact. Several scientific studies have shown that when people, especially those living in [[developed country|developed countries]] but more generally including all countries, wish to reduce their carbon footprint, there are four key "high-impact" actions they can take:&lt;ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017&gt;{{cite journal |title= The climate mitigation gap: education and government recommendations miss the most effective individual actions |journal= Environmental Research Letters |first1= Seth |last1= Wynes |first2= Kimberly A |last2= Nicholas |date= 12 July 2017 |volume= 12 |page= 074024 |number= 7 |doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541 |bibcode= 2017ERL....12g4024W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ceballos|first1=Gerardo|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul P |last3=Dirzo|first3=Rodolfo|date=23 May 2017|title=Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/07/05/1704949114.full|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|volume=114|issue=30|pages=E6089–E6096|quote=Much less frequently mentioned are, however, the ultimate drivers of those immediate causes of biotic destruction, namely, human overpopulation and continued population growth, and overconsumption, especially by the rich.

:3. Avoiding one round-trip transatlantic flight (1.6 tonnes)

:4. Eating a [[plant-based diet]] (0.8 tonnes)

These appear to differ significantly from the popular advice for “greening” one's lifestyle, which seem to fall mostly into the “low-impact” category: Replacing a typical car with a hybrid (0.52 tonnes); Washing clothes in cold water (0.25 tonnes); Recycling (0.21 tonnes); Upgrading light bulbs (0.10 tonnes); etc. The researchers found that public discourse on reducing one's carbon footprint overwhelmingly focuses on low-impact behaviors, and that mention of the high-impact behaviors is almost non-existent in the mainstream media, government publications, K-12 school textbooks, etc.&lt;ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05/&gt;&lt;ref name="PimmJenkins"/&gt;

The researchers added that “Our recommended high-impact actions are more effective than many more commonly discussed options (e.g. eating a plant-based diet saves eight times more emissions than upgrading light bulbs). More significantly, a US family who chooses to have one fewer child would provide the same level of emissions reductions as 684 teenagers who choose to adopt comprehensive recycling for the rest of their lives.”&lt;ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05/&gt;&lt;ref name="PimmJenkins"/&gt;

Overall, food accounts for the largest share of consumption-based GHG emissions with nearly 20% of the global carbon footprint, followed by housing, mobility, services, manufactured products, and construction.

====Energy efficiency and conservation====
{{Main|Efficient energy use|Energy conservation}}
[[File:Led-lampa.jpg|thumb|A 230-volt LED light bulb, with an [[Edison screw|E27]] base (10 [[watt]]s, 806 [[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s).]]

Efficient energy use, sometimes simply called "energy efficiency", is the goal of efforts to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing [[LED lamp|LED lighting]], [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]], or natural [[skylight|skylight windows]] reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional [[incandescent light bulb]]s. [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]s use only 33% of the energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than incandescent lights.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Diesendorf|Diesendorf, Mark]] (2007). ''[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]'', UNSW Press, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; LED lamps use only about 10% of the energy an incandescent lamp requires.

Energy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing [[world energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]]. For example, the state of [[California]] began implementing energy-efficiency measures in the mid-1970s, including building code and appliance standards with strict efficiency requirements. During the following years, California's energy consumption has remained approximately flat on a per capita basis while national US consumption doubled. As part of its strategy, California implemented a "loading order" for new energy resources that puts energy efficiency first, renewable electricity supplies second, and new fossil-fired power plants last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses using less energy to achieve a lesser energy demanding service, for example through behavioral change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter, driving less, or working in a less brightly lit room. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&amp;itemid=2929&amp;language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Demand-side switching sources====
Fuel switching on the demand side refers to changing the type of fuel used to satisfy a need for an energy service. To meet deep decarbonization goals, like the 80% reduction by 2050 goal being discussed in California and the European Union, many primary energy changes are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Climate Change |publisher=California Air Resources Board |accessdate=2015-04-29 |url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/cc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Roadmap for moving to a low-carbon economy in 2050 – European Commission |accessdate= 2015-04-29 |url= http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/roadmap/index_en.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150511100639/http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/roadmap/index_en.htm |archive-date= 2015-05-11 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy efficiency alone may not be sufficient to meet these goals, switching fuels used on the demand side will help lower carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/8/1/014038 |issn= 1748-9326 |volume= 8 |issue= 1 |page= 014038 |last1= Wei |first1= Max |last2= Nelson |first2= James H |last3= Greenblatt |first3= Jeffery B |last4= Mileva |first4= Ana |last5= Johnston |first5= Josiah |last6= Ting |first6= Michael |last7= Yang |first7= Christopher |last8= Jones |first8= Chris |last9= McMahon |first9= James E |last10= Kammen |first10= Daniel M |title= Deep carbon reductions in California require electrification and integration across economic sectors |journal= Environmental Research Letters |accessdate= 2015-03-21 |date= 2013-03-01 |url= http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/8/i=1/a=014038?key=crossref.37ef0d9dff3c11bf4c176aa87e4f5831|bibcode= 2013ERL.....8a4038W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Williams |first= James H. |title= The technology path to deep greenhouse gas emissions cuts by 2050: The pivotal role of electricity |journal= Science |volume= 335 |issue= 6064 |pages= 53–9 |accessdate= 2015-03-21 |date= 2012 |url= https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2mz2472z.pdf |bibcode= 2012Sci...335...53W |doi= 10.1126/science.1208365|pmid= 22116030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Progressively coal, oil and eventually natural gas for space and water heating in buildings will need to be reduced. For an equivalent amount of heat, burning natural gas produces about 45 per cent less carbon dioxide than burning [[coal]].&lt;ref name=gasdotorg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalgas.org/environment/naturalgas.asp#greenhouse/ |title=Natural Gas and the Environment |publisher=Naturalgas.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503132200/http://www.naturalgas.org/environment/naturalgas.asp#greenhouse/ |archivedate=2009-05-03 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various ways in which this could happen, and different strategies will likely make sense in different locations. While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric [[heat pump]] has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very efficient [[coefficient of performance]] of heat pumps.

At the beginning of this century 70% of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels, and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix, replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common.

The economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating, will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment. The EIA Annual Energy Outlook 2014 suggests that domestic gas prices will rise faster than electricity prices which will encourage electrification in the coming decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/ |title=Annual Energy Outlook 2015 – Energy Information Administration |publisher=Eia.gov |date=2015-04-14 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]]. Since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage, electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid.

Alternatives to electrification, include decarbonizing pipeline gas through [[power to gas]], [[biogas]], or other [[carbon-neutral fuels]]. A 2015 study by Energy+Environmental Economics shows that a hybrid approach of decarbonizing pipeline gas, electrification, and energy efficiency can meet carbon reduction goals at a similar cost as only electrification and energy efficiency in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= E3 Decarbonizing Pipeline 01-27-2015.pdf |accessdate= 2015-04-14 |url= https://ethree.com/documents/E3_Decarbonizing_Pipeline_01-27-2015.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150717182053/https://ethree.com/documents/E3_Decarbonizing_Pipeline_01-27-2015.pdf |archive-date= 2015-07-17 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Demand side grid management====
Expanding intermittent electrical sources such as [[wind power]], creates a growing problem balancing grid fluctuations. Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental [[super grid]]s costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittentcy, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a [[smart grid]].

[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.

[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers would need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.

[[Demand response]] devices could receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This would allow electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. The [[vehicle-to-grid]] suggestion would use a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.

A [[Yale University]] review published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology analyzing {{CO2}} [[life cycle assessment]](LCA) emissions from nuclear power([[light water reactor]]s) determined that: "The collective LCA literature indicates that life cycle [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions from nuclear power are only a fraction of traditional fossil sources and comparable to renewable technologies."&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE"/&gt;
While some have raised uncertainty surrounding the future GHG emissions of nuclear power as a result of an extreme potential decline in uranium ore grade without a corresponding increase in the [[enriched uranium|efficiency of enrichment methods]]. In a scenario analysis of future global nuclear development, as it could be effected by a decreasing global [[uranium market]] of average ore grade, the analysis determined that depending on conditions, median life cycle nuclear power GHG emissions could be between 9 and 110&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}-eq/kWh by 2050, with the latter high figure being derived from a "worst-case scenario" that is not "considered very robust" by the authors of the paper, as the "ore grade" in the scenario is lower than the uranium concentration in many lignite coal ashes.&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Warner |first1= E.

Although this future analyses primarily deals with extrapolations for present [[Generation II reactor]] technology, the same paper also summarizes the literature on "FBRs"/[[Fast Breeder Reactor]]s, of which two are in operation as of 2014 with the newest being the [[BN-800 reactor|BN-800]], for these reactors it states that the "median life cycle GHG emissions&amp;nbsp;...

It is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/factsheet_energy_speech_080308.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017172925/http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/factsheet_energy_speech_080308.pdf |archivedate=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis in 2015 by Professor and Chair of Environmental Sustainability [[Barry Brook (scientist)|Barry W. Brook]] and his colleagues on the topic of replacing fossil fuels entirely, from the electric grid of the world, has determined that at the historically modest and proven-rate at which nuclear energy was added to and replaced fossil fuels in France and Sweden during each nation's building programs in the 1980s, within 10 years nuclear energy could displace or remove fossil fuels from the electric grid completely, "allow[ing] the world to meet the most stringent greenhouse-gas mitigation targets.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Potential for Worldwide Displacement of Fossil-Fuel Electricity by Nuclear Energy in Three Decades Based on Extrapolation of Regional Deployment Data|first1=Staffan A.|last1=Qvist|first2=Barry W.|last2=Brook|date=13 May 2015|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=10|issue=5|page=e0124074|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0124074|pmid=25970621|pmc=4429979|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1024074Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar analysis, Brook had earlier determined that 50% of all [[world energy consumption|global energy]], that is not solely electricity, but transportation [[synfuels]] etc. could be generated within approximately 30 years, if the global nuclear fission build rate was identical to each of these nation's already proven decadal rates(in units of installed [[nameplate capacity]], [[gigawatt|GW]] per year, per unit of global [[GDP]](GW/year/$).&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421511009189|title=Could nuclear fission energy, etc., solve the greenhouse problem?

[[Nuclear fusion]] research, in the form of the [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]] is underway. Fusion powered electricity generation was initially believed to be readily achievable, as fission power had been.

Natural gas emits far fewer greenhouse gases (i.e. {{CO2}} and methane—CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) than coal when burned at power plants, but evidence has been emerging that this benefit could be completely negated by methane leakage at gas drilling fields and other points in the supply chain.

A study performed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Gas Research Institute (GRI) in 1997 sought to discover whether the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from increased natural gas (predominantly methane) use would be offset by a possible increased level of [[methane emissions]] from sources such as leaks and emissions. The study concluded that the reduction in emissions from increased natural gas use outweighs the detrimental effects of increased methane emissions. More recent peer-reviewed studies have challenged the findings of this study, with researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reconfirming findings of high rates of methane (CH4) leakage from natural gas fields.

A 2011 study&lt;ref name="usclimatenetwork.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/resource-database/report-coal-to-gas-the-influence-of-methane-leakage |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102222215/http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/resource-database/report-coal-to-gas-the-influence-of-methane-leakage |archive-date=2015-01-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by noted climate research scientist, Tom Wigley,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Wigley]]&lt;/ref&gt; found that while carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) emissions from fossil fuel combustion may be reduced by using natural gas rather than coal to produce energy, it also found that additional methane (CH4) from leakage adds to the radiative forcing of the climate system, offsetting the reduction in {{CO2}} forcing that accompanies the transition from coal to gas. The study looked at methane leakage from coal mining; changes in radiative forcing due to changes in the emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols; and differences in the efficiency of electricity production between coal- and gas-fired power generation. On balance, these factors more than offset the reduction in warming due to reduced {{CO2}} emissions. When gas replaces coal there is additional warming out to 2,050 with an assumed leakage rate of 0%, and out to 2,140 if the leakage rate is as high as 10%. The overall effects on global-mean temperature over the 21st century, however, are small. Petron et al.

These studies indicate that the exploitation of natural gas as a "cleaner" fuel is questionable. A 2014 meta-study of 20 years of natural gas technical literature shows that methane emissions are consistently underestimated but on a 100-year scale, the climate benefits of coal to gas fuel switching are likely larger than the negative effects of natural gas leakage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |volume= 343 |issue= 6172 |pages= 733–35 |last1= Brandt |first1= A.

====Heat pump====
{{Main|Heat pump}}
[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]
A heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a "heat sink". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.

While [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term "heat pump" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction—releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28037.pdf Air-source heat pumps] [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In heating mode, heat pumps are three to four times [[efficient energy use|more efficient]] in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters.

It has been concluded that heat pumps are the single technology that could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that is available on the market. With a market share of 30% and (potentially) clean electricity, heat pumps could reduce global {{CO2}} emissions by 8% annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Staffell Iain ''et al.'' |year= 2012 |title= A review of domestic heat pumps |url= |journal= [[Energy and Environmental Science]] |volume= 5 |issue= 11 |pages= 9291–9306 |doi= 10.1039/c2ee22653g}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using ground source heat pumps could reduce around 60% of the [[primary energy]] demand and 90% of {{CO2}} emissions in Europe in 2050 and make handling high shares of renewable energy easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Carvalho |first1= |display-authors= 1 |last2= et al |year= 2015 |title= Ground source heat pump carbon emissions and primary energy reduction potential for heating in buildings in Europe—results of a case study in Portugal |url= |journal= [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] |volume= 45 |issue= |pages= 755–768 |doi= 10.1016/j.rser.2015.02.034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using surplus renewable energy in heat pumps is regarded as the most effective household means to reduce global warming and fossil fuel depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Sternberg André, Bardow André |year= 2015 |title= ''Power-to-What? – Environmental assessment of energy storage systems''.

With significant amounts of fossil fuel used in electricity production, demands on the electrical grid also generate greenhouse gases. Without a high share of low-carbon electricity, a domestic heat pump will produce more carbon emissions than using natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energysolutionscenter.org/assets/1/Page/GHP_Position_Paper_and_apndx_031710.pdf pg 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinks and negative emissions===
{{Main|Carbon sink|Negative carbon dioxide emission}}

A [[carbon sink]] is a natural or artificial reservoir that accumulates and stores some carbon-containing chemical compound for an indefinite period, such as a growing [[forest]]. A [[negative carbon dioxide emission]] on the other hand is a permanent removal of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Examples are [[carbon capture and storage|direct air capture]], [[enhanced weathering]] technologies such as storing it in [[geologic sequestration of CO2|geologic formations]] underground and [[biochar]]. These processes are sometimes considered as variations of sinks or mitigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Reforestation and afforestation====
[[File:Shennongjia virgin forest.jpg|thumb|Transferring [[land rights]] to indigenous inhabitants is argued to efficiently conserve forests.]]
{{Main|Deforestation|Reforestation|Biosequestration}}

Almost 20 percent (8{{nbsp}}GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/year) of total greenhouse-gas emissions were from deforestation in 2007. It is estimated that avoided deforestation reduces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions at a rate of 1{{nbsp}}tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per $1–5 in [[opportunity costs]] from lost agriculture. [[Reforestation]] could save at least another 1{{nbsp}}GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/year, at an estimated cost of $5–15/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="stern"/&gt; [[Afforestation]] is where there was previously no forest - such plantations are estimated to have to be prohibitively massive to be reduce emissions by itself.&lt;ref&gt;Lena R.

With increased [[intensive agriculture]] and [[urbanization]], there is an increase in the amount of abandoned farmland. By some estimates, for every half a hectare of original [[old-growth forest]] cut down, more than 20 hectares of new [[secondary forest]]s are growing, even though they do not have the same biodiversity as the original forests and original forests store 60% more carbon than these new secondary forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/science/earth/30forest.html?pagewanted=all|title=New Jungles Prompt a Debate on Rain Forests|publisher=New York Times |accessdate=18 July 2016|date=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, E.

Restoring grasslands store CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air into plant material. Grazing livestock, usually not left to wander, would eat the grass and would minimize any grass growth.

[[File:Carbon sequestration-2009-10-07.svg|thumb|350px|Schematic showing both terrestrial and geological sequestration of carbon dioxide emissions from a coal-fired plant]]
{{Main|Carbon capture and storage}}

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a method to mitigate climate change by capturing [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from large point sources such as power plants and subsequently storing it away safely instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. The IPCC estimates that the costs of halting global warming would double without CCS.&lt;ref name=guardian0916&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/09/co2-turned-into-stone-in-iceland-in-climate-change-breakthrough|title=CO2 turned into stone in Iceland in climate change breakthrough|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 September 2017|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Energy Agency says CCS is "the most important single new technology for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; savings" in power generation and industry.&lt;ref name=futureenergysummit&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson |first=Simon |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1954176_1954175,00.html |title=How to Reduce Carbon Emissions: Capture and Store it? |publisher=[[Time.com]] |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it requires up to 40% more energy to run a CCS coal power plant than a regular coal plant, CCS could potentially capture about 90% of all the carbon emitted by the plant.&lt;ref name=futureenergysummit/&gt; Norway's [[Sleipner gas field]], beginning in 1996, stores almost a million tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; a year to avoid penalties in producing natural gas with unusually high levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;https://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/sleipner.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=futureenergysummit/&gt; As of late 2011, the total planned {{CO2}} storage capacity of all 14 projects in operation or under construction is over 33 million tonnes a year.

====Enhanced weathering====
Enhanced weathering is the removal of carbon from the air into the earth, enhancing the natural carbon cycle where carbon is mineralized into rock. The [[CarbFix]] project couples with carbon capture and storage in power plants to turn carbon dioxide into stone in a relatively short period of two years, addressing the common concern of leakage in CCS projects. While this project used [[basalt]] rocks, [[olivine]] has also shown promise.&lt;ref name=guardian0916/&gt;

===Geoengineering===
{{Main|Climate engineering}}

Geoengineering is seen by Olivier Sterck as an alternative to mitigation and adaptation, but by Gernot Wagner as an entirely separate response to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00635487/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.climatecentral.org/news/harvard-scientists-taking-geoengineering-into-the-field-21362&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[scientific literature|literature]] assessment, Barker ''et al.''

Chapter 28 of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] report ''Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Mitigation, Adaptation, and the Science Base'' (1992) defined geoengineering as "options that would involve large-scale engineering of our environment in order to combat or counteract the effects of changes in atmospheric chemistry."&lt;ref name="nas_policy_implications"&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1605&amp;page=433 Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Mitigation, Adaptation, and the Science Base] (1992), [[Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy]] (COSEPUP)&lt;/ref&gt; They evaluated a range of options to try to give preliminary answers to two questions: can these options work and could they be carried out with a reasonable cost. They also sought to encourage discussion of a third question&amp;nbsp;— what adverse side effects might there be. The following types of option were examined: reforestation, increasing ocean absorption of carbon dioxide (carbon sequestration) and screening out some sunlight. NAS also argued "Engineered countermeasures need to be evaluated but should not be implemented without broad understanding of the direct effects and the potential side effects, the ethical issues, and the risks.".&lt;ref name="nas_policy_implications"/&gt; In July 2011 a report by the [[United States Government Accountability Office]] on geoengineering found that "[c]limate engineering technologies do not now offer a viable response to global climate change."&lt;ref&gt;GAO (2011).

====Carbon dioxide removal====
{{Main|Carbon dioxide removal|Greenhouse gas remediation|Carbon sequestration}}
{{See also|Carbon air capture}}

[[Carbon dioxide removal]] has been proposed as a method of reducing the amount of radiative forcing. A variety of means of artificially capturing and storing carbon, as well as of enhancing natural sequestration processes, are being explored. The main natural process is [[photosynthesis]] by plants and single-celled organisms (see [[biosequestration]]). Artificial processes vary, and concerns have been expressed about the long-term effects of some of these processes.&lt;ref name=RoyalSociety&gt;The Royal Society, (2009) [http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=35151 "Geoengineering the climate: science, governance and uncertainty"]. Retrieved 2009-09-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is notable that the availability of cheap energy and appropriate sites for [[carbon capture and storage|geological storage]] of carbon may make [[carbon dioxide air capture]] viable commercially. It is, however, generally expected that carbon dioxide air capture may be uneconomic when compared to [[carbon capture and storage]] from major sources&amp;nbsp;— in particular, fossil fuel powered power stations, refineries, etc. As in the case of the US [[Kemper Project]] with carbon capture, costs of energy produced will grow significantly.

The emissions caps agreed to by most developed countries under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] regulate the emissions of almost all the anthropogenic GHGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

These gases are CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), the [[halocarbon|hydrofluorocarbons]] (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), and [[sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).

Stabilizing the atmospheric concentrations of the different anthropogenic GHGs requires an understanding of their different physical properties. Stabilization depends both on how quickly GHGs are added to the atmosphere and how fast they are removed. The rate of removal is measured by the atmospheric lifetime of the GHG in question (see the [[greenhouse gas#Global warming potential|main GHG article]] for a list). Here, the lifetime is defined as the time required for a given perturbation of the GHG in the atmosphere to be reduced to 37% of its initial amount.&lt;ref name="meehl stabilizing ghg concentrations"/&gt;
Methane has a relatively short atmospheric lifetime of about 12 years, while N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O's lifetime is about 110 years. For methane, a reduction of about 30% below current emission levels would lead to a stabilization in its atmospheric concentration, while for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, an emissions reduction of more than 50% would be required.&lt;ref name="meehl stabilizing ghg concentrations"/&gt;

[[Methane]] is a significantly more potent greenhouse gas than [[carbon dioxide]] in the amount of heat it can trap, especially in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Methane vs. Carbon Dioxide: A Greenhouse Gas Showdown|url= http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/|website= One Green Planet|accessdate= 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burning one molecule of methane generates one molecule of carbon dioxide, indicating there may be no net benefit in using gas as a fuel source.&lt;ref name="usclimatenetwork.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt; Reducing the amount of waste methane produced in the first place and moving away from use of gas as a fuel source will have a greater beneficial impact, as might other approaches to productive use of otherwise-wasted methane. In terms of prevention, vaccines are being developed in Australia to reduce the significant global warming contributions from [[methane]] released by livestock via [[flatulence]] and [[eructation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6431 Burp vaccine cuts greenhouse gas emissions] ''Rachel Nowak'' for NewScientist September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Another physical property of the anthropogenic GHGs relevant to mitigation is the different abilities of the gases to trap heat (in the form of [[infrared radiation]]). Some gases are more effective at trapping heat than others, e.g., SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is 22,200 times more effective a GHG than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on a per-kilogram basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Transport===
{{Main|Sustainable transport}}
Transportation emissions account for roughly 1/4 of emissions worldwide, and are even more important in terms of impact in developed nations especially in North America and Australia. Many citizens of countries like the United States and Canada who drive personal cars often, see well over half of their climate change impact stemming from the emissions produced from their cars. Modes of mass transportation such as bus, light rail (metro, subway, etc.), and long-distance rail are far and away the most energy-efficient means of motorized transportation for passengers, able to use in many cases over twenty times less energy per person-distance than a personal automobile. Modern [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient technologies]], such as [[plug-in hybrid]] electric vehicles and [[carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral synthetic gasoline &amp; Jet fuel]] may also help to reduce the consumption of [[petroleum]], land use changes and emissions of [[carbon dioxide]]. Utilizing [[rail transport]], especially electric rail, over the far less efficient [[environmental impact of aviation|air transport]] and [[road transport|truck transport]]
significantly reduces emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Urban planning===
{{Main|Urban planning}}

Effective [[urban planning]] to reduce [[urban sprawl|sprawl]] aims to decrease Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT), lowering emissions from transportation. Personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers, while [[public transport]] and bicycles are many times more efficient (as is the simplest form of human transportation, walking). All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Between 1982 and 1997, the amount of land consumed for [[urban development]] in the United States increased by 47 percent while the nation's population grew by only 17 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.

At the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These [[smart growth]] practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.

Approaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through "medium-density", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.&lt;!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book "Sustainability and Cities" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.--&gt;

Smarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.

====Building design====

For institutions of higher learning in the United States, greenhouse gas emissions depend primarily on total area of buildings and secondarily on climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fetcher|first=Ned|title=Effects of climate and institution size on greenhouse gas emissions from colleges and universities in the United States|journal=Sustainability: The Journal of Record|date=December 2009|volume=2|issue=6|pages=362–67|doi=10.1089/SUS.2009.9820}}&lt;/ref&gt; If climate is not taken into account, annual greenhouse gas emissions due to energy consumed on campuses plus purchased electricity can be estimated with the formula, ''E=aS''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''a'' =0.001621 metric tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent/square foot or 0.0241 metric tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent/square meter and ''b''= 1.1354.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Colleges and Universities|url=http://www.wilkes.edu/pages/4243.asp|accessdate=2 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106105803/http://www.wilkes.edu/pages/4243.asp|archive-date=2011-01-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources. Existing buildings can be made more efficient through the use of insulation, high-efficiency appliances (particularly [[hot water heater]]s and [[furnaces]]), [[insulated glazing|double- or triple-glazed gas-filled windows]], external window shades, and building orientation and siting. Renewable heat sources such as [[geothermal heat pump|shallow geothermal]] and [[passive solar]] energy reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted. In addition to designing buildings which are more energy-efficient to heat, it is possible to design buildings that are more energy-efficient to cool by using lighter-coloured, more reflective materials in the development of urban areas (e.g. by painting roofs white) and planting trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Agriculture===
{{See also|Climate change and agriculture}}
According to the [[EPA]], agricultural [[soil management]] practices can lead to production and emission of [[nitrous oxide]] (N2O), a major [[greenhouse gas]] and air pollutant. Activities that can contribute to {{chem|N|2|O}} emissions include [[fertilizer]] usage, [[irrigation]], and [[tillage]]. The management of soils accounts for over half of the emissions from the Agriculture sector. Cattle livestocks account for one third of emissions, through methane emissions. Manure management and rice cultivation also produce gaseous emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/sources/agriculture.html|title=Agriculture: Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions|year=2015|publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study found that farming can deplete soil carbon and render soil incapable of supporting life; however, the study also showed that [[conservation farming]] can protect carbon in soils, and repair damage over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://eos.org/research-spotlights/conservation-farming-shown-to-protect-carbon-in-soil|title=Conservation Farming Shown to Protect Carbon in Soil|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences|authors=A.

===Societal controls===
{{Main|Personal carbon credits}}

Another method being examined is to make carbon a new currency by introducing tradeable "[[personal carbon credits]]". The idea being it will encourage and motivate individuals to reduce their 'carbon footprint' by the way they live. Each citizen will receive a free annual quota of carbon that they can use to travel, buy food, and go about their business. It has been suggested that by using this concept it could actually solve two problems; pollution and poverty, old age pensioners will actually be better off because they fly less often, so they can cash in their quota at the end of the year to pay heating bills and so forth.{{citation needed|reason=previous source deadlink|date=April 2009}}

===Costs===
The [[Stern Review]] proposes stabilising the concentration of greenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere at a maximum of 550ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e by 2050. The Review estimates that this would mean cutting total greenhouse-gas emissions to three quarters of 2007 levels. The Review further estimates that the cost of these cuts would be in the range −1.0 to +3.5% of World [[GDP]], (i.e. [[Gross world product|GWP]]), with an average estimate of approximately 1%.&lt;ref name="stern"/&gt; Stern has since revised his estimate to 2% of GWP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/26/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange |title=Cost of tackling global climate change has doubled, warns Stern |first= Juliette |last=Jowit |first2= Patrick |last2=Wintour |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 June 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, the Gross World Product (GWP) at [[purchasing power parity|PPP]] was estimated at $74.5 trillion in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Mitigation costs will also vary according to how and when emissions are cut: early, well-planned action will minimise the costs.&lt;ref name="stern"&gt;Stern, N. (2006). ''Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change: Part III: The Economics of Stabilisation.'' HM Treasury, London: http://hm-treasury.gov.uk/sternreview_index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

One way of estimating the cost of reducing emissions is by considering the likely costs of potential technological and output changes. Policy makers can compare the [[marginal abatement costs]] of different methods to assess the cost and amount of possible abatement over time. The marginal abatement costs of the various measures will differ by country, by sector, and over time.&lt;ref name="stern"/&gt;

This was judged to be especially the case when combined with enhanced adaptation. By 2100, however, it was still judged likely that there would be significant [[effects of global warming]]. This was judged to be the case even with aggressive mitigation and significantly enhanced [[adaptive capacity]].

|doi=10.2277/0521568544|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wealth, as measured by per capita income (i.e., income per head of population), varies widely between different countries. Activities of the poor that involve emissions of GHGs are often associated with basic needs, such as [[heating]] to stay tolerably warm. In richer countries, emissions tend to be associated with things like [[car]]s, [[central heating]], etc. The impacts of cutting emissions could therefore have different impacts on human [[welfare economics|welfare]] according to wealth.

====Distributing emissions abatement costs====
There have been different proposals on how to allocate responsibility for cutting emissions (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;103–105):&lt;ref name=banuri/&gt;
*'''[[Egalitarianism]]''': this system interprets the problem as one where each person has equal rights to a global resource, i.e., polluting the atmosphere.
*'''Basic needs''': this system would have emissions allocated according to basic needs, as defined according to a minimum level of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.
*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the "polluter-pays principle", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:
**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;29).&lt;ref name=goldemberg&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-0-521-56854-8
|doi=10.2277/0521568544|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**''Comparable burdens and ability to pay'': with this approach, countries would reduce emissions based on comparable burdens and their ability to take on the costs of reduction. Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].
**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit from reducing their emissions.
**''Carbon inheritance'':&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Insurance companies should collect a carbon levy |journal=Nature |volume=549 |issue=7671 |pages=152-154 |first1=Anthony J. |last1=Webster |last2=Clarke |first2=Richard H. |year=2017 |doi=10.1038/549152a }}&lt;/ref&gt; Is the notion that we have inherited the (technological) benefits of past emissions, and those who benefit most from them should pay the most. An energy levy has been suggested as a proxy for technological development. Rather than allocating blame for historical emissions, an energy levy pays back the benefits these technologies have brought&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Insurance companies should collect a carbon levy |journal=Nature |volume=549 |issue=7671 |pages=152-154 |first1=Anthony J. |last1=Webster |last2=Clarke |first2=Richard H. |year=2017 |doi=10.1038/549152a }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Specific proposals====
*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;106),&lt;ref name=banuri/&gt; for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.
*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;106–107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.
*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;27).&lt;ref name=goldemberg/&gt; In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource. It was also recognized by the state that part of the other state's economy was dependent on that resource.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of these technologies aids mitigation and could result in substantial reductions in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Policies include targets for emissions reductions, increased use of renewable energy, and increased energy efficiency. It is often argued that the results of climate change are more damaging in poor nations, where infrastructures are weak and few social services exist. The [[Commitment to Development Index]] is one attempt to analyze rich country policies taken to reduce their disproportionate use of the global commons. Countries do well if their greenhouse gas emissions are falling, if their gas taxes are high, if they do not subsidize the fishing industry, if they have a low fossil fuel rate per capita, and if they control imports of illegally cut tropical timber.

===Kyoto Protocol===
{{Main|Kyoto Protocol}}

The main current international agreement on combating climate change is the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. On the 11th of December 1997 it was implemented by the 3rd conference of parties, which was coming together in kyoto, which came into force on 16 February 2005. The Kyoto Protocol is an [[wikt:amendment|amendment]] to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). [[List of Kyoto Protocol signatories|Countries that have ratified this protocol]] have committed to reduce their emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] and five other greenhouse gases, or engage in [[emissions trading]] if they maintain or increase emissions of these gases. For Kyoto reporting, governments are obliged to be told on the present state of the countries forests and the related ongoing processes.

*Policies adopted by parties to the UNFCCC are too weak to meet a 2 or 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C target. However, these targets might still be achievable if more stringent mitigation policies are adopted immediately.
*Cost-effective 2&amp;nbsp;°C scenarios project annual global greenhouse gas emissions to peak before the year 2020, with deep cuts in emissions thereafter, leading to a reduction in 2050 of 41% compared to 1990 levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alcamo|others|2013|pp=xiii–xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Discussion on other targets
Scientific analysis can provide information on the impacts of climate change and associated policies, such as reducing GHG emissions. However, deciding what policies are best requires value judgements.&lt;ref name="wg 2 ch19 dangerous climate change"/&gt; For example, limiting global warming to 1&amp;nbsp;°C relative to pre-industrial levels may help to reduce climate change damages more than a 2&amp;nbsp;°C limit.&lt;ref&gt;"Implication for Carbon Emissions Target," in: {{harvnb|Hansen|others|2013|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 1&amp;nbsp;°C limit may be more costly to achieve than a 2&amp;nbsp;°C limit.&lt;ref&gt;"4.

Emission taxes can be both cost-effective and environmentally effective.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"/&gt; Difficulties with emission taxes include their potential unpopularity, and the fact that they cannot guarantee a particular level of emissions reduction.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"/&gt; Emissions or energy taxes also often fall disproportionately on lower income classes. In developing countries, institutions may be insufficiently developed for the collection of emissions fees from a wide variety of sources.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"/&gt;

====Subsidies====
According to [[Mark Z. Jacobson]], a program of subsidization balanced against expected flood costs could pay for conversion to 100% renewable power by 2030.&lt;ref name="wws-review"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Jacobson |first1= M.Z. |year= 2009 |title= Review of solutions to global warming, air pollution, and energy security |url= http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/PDF%20files/ReviewSolGW09.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100424234910/http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/PDF%20files/ReviewSolGW09.pdf |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2010-04-24 |format= PDF |journal= Energy and Environmental Science |volume= 2 |issue= 2 |pages= 148–73 |doi= 10.1039/b809990c|citeseerx= 10.1.1.180.4676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobson, and his colleague Mark Delucchi, suggest that the cost to generate and transmit power in 2020 will be less than 4 cents per kilowatt hour (in 2007 dollars) for wind, about 4 cents for wave and hydroelectric, from 4 to 7 cents for geothermal, and 8 cents per kWh for solar, fossil, and nuclear power.&lt;ref name=wws&gt;{{cite journal|last1= [[Mark Z.

====Investment====
{{See also|Fossil fuel divestment}}

Another indirect method of encouraging uses of renewable energy, and pursue sustainability and environmental protection, is that of prompting investment in this area through legal means, something that is already being done at national level as well as in the field of international investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=Sustainable Energy Investments and National Security: Arbitration and Negotiation Issues|journal=Journal of World Energy Law and Business|date=2015|volume=8|issue=6|ssrn=2695579|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carbon emissions trading====
{{Main|Carbon emissions trading}}

With the creation of a [[market (economics)|market]] for [[carbon emissions trading|trading carbon dioxide emissions]] within the Kyoto Protocol, it is likely that London financial markets will be the centre for this potentially highly lucrative business; the [[NYSE|New York]] and [[Chicago]] stock markets may have a lower trade volume than expected as long as the US maintains its rejection of the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/focus/story/0,,1509761,00.html How high-pressure politics threatens action on climate] The Observer June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

However, emissions trading may delay the phase-out of fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;''StoryOfStuff.com'' (2009) [http://storyofstuff.com/capandtrade/ "The Story of Cap and Trade"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722034154/http://www.storyofstuff.com/capandtrade/ |date=2010-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the north-east United States, a successful cap and trade program has shown potential for this solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceprogress.org/2013/02/success-of-northeast-cap-and-trade-system-shows-market-based-climate-policy-is-well-within-reach/|title=Success of Northeast Cap-and-Trade System Shows Market-Based Climate Policy Is Well Within Reach|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission.htm Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS)] from ''ec.europa.eu''&lt;/ref&gt; is the largest multi-national, greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world. It commenced operation on 1 January 2005, and all 28 member states of the [[European Union]] participate in the scheme which has created a new market in carbon dioxide allowances estimated at 35&amp;nbsp;billion Euros (US$43&amp;nbsp;billion) per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-climate_change_debate/2570.jsp The $20,000,000,000,000 question] ''Robins, Nick'' for Opendemocracy&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] was the first (voluntary) emissions market, and is soon to be followed by Asia's first market ([[Asia Carbon Exchange]]). A total of 107 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent have been exchanged through projects in 2004, a 38% increase relative to 2003 (78 Mt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e).&lt;ref&gt;[http://carbonfinance.org/docs/CarbonMarketStudy2005.pdf State and Trends of the Carbon Market] International Emissions Trading Association 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty three [[multinational corporation]]s have come together in the [[G8 Climate Change Roundtable]], a business group formed at the January 2005 [[World Economic Forum]]. The group includes [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Toyota]], [[British Airways]], and [[BP]]. On 9 June 2005 the Group published a statement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weforum.org/pdf/g8_climatechange.pdf Statement of G8 Climate Change Roundtable] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508123035/http://www.weforum.org/pdf/g8_climatechange.pdf |date=May 8, 2013}} Convened by the World Economic Forum June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; stating that there was a need to act on climate change and claiming that market-based solutions can help. It called on governments to establish "clear, transparent, and consistent price signals" through "creation of a long-term policy framework" that would include all major producers of greenhouse gases.

The [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] is a proposed carbon trading scheme being created by nine North-eastern and Mid-Atlantic [[United States|American]] states; [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Vermont]]. The scheme was due to be developed by April 2005 but has not yet been completed.

===Implementation===
Implementation puts into effect climate change mitigation strategies and targets. These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon&lt;/ref&gt;

====Funding====
Implementation requires funding sources but is often beset by disputes over who should provide funds and under what conditions.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; A lack of funding can be a barrier to successful strategies as there are no formal arrangements to finance climate change development and implementation.&lt;ref name="IHDP"&gt;Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat. P, Klostermann.J.E.M (unpublished) Institutional governance barriers for the development and implementation of climate adaptation strategies, Working paper for the International Human Dimensions Programme (IHDP) conference "Earth System Governance: People, Places, and the Planet", December 2–4, Amsterdam, the Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; Funding is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Mee. L. D, Dublin. H. T, Eberhard. A. A (2008) Evaluating the Global Environment Facility: A goodwill gesture or a serious attempt to deliver global benefits?, Global Environmental Change 18, 800–810&lt;/ref&gt;

====Problems====
There are numerous issues which result in a current perceived lack of implementation.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; It has been suggested that the main barriers to implementation are Uncertainty, Fragmentation, Institutional void, Short time horizon of policies and politicians and Missing motives and willingness to start adapting. The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.&lt;ref name="IHDP"/&gt; The issues that arise with a system which involves international government cooperation, such as [[emissions trading|cap and trade]], could potentially be improved with a polycentric approach where the rules are enforced by many small sections of authority as opposed to one overall enforcement agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www10.iadb.org/intal/intalcdi/pe/2009/04268.pdf |title=A Polycentric Approach for Coping with Climate Change |publisher=World Bank |date=October 2009 |author=Elinor Ostrom |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101164212/http://www10.iadb.org/intal/intalcdi/pe/2009/04268.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-01 |series=Policy Research Working Paper Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about metal requirement and/or availability for essential decarbonization technoloqies such as [[photovoltaics]], [[nuclear power]], and (plug-in hybrid) [[electric vehicle]]s have also been expressed as obstacles.&lt;ref name="Tokimatsu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tokimatsu|first1=Koji|last2=Wachtmeister|first2=Henrik|last3=McLellan|first3=Benjamin|last4=Davidsson|first4=Simon|last5=Murakami|first5=Shinsuke|last6=Höök|first6=Mikael|last7=Yasuoka|first7=Rieko|last8=Nishio|first8=Masahiro|title=Energy modeling approach to the global energy-mineral nexus: A first look at metal requirements and the 2 °C target|journal=Applied Energy|date=December 2017|volume=207|pages=494–509|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.05.151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occurrence====
Despite a perceived lack of occurrence, evidence of implementation is emerging internationally. Some examples of this are the initiation of NAPA's and of joint implementation. Many developing nations have made National Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPAs) which are frameworks to prioritize adaption needs.&lt;ref name="EMJ"&gt;Preston. B. L, Westaway. R. M, Yuen. E. Y (2004) Climate adaptation planning in practice: an evaluation of adaptation plans from three developed nations, European Management Journal, 22(3) 304–314&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of many of these is supported by GEF agencies.&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC (2011) Report on the twentieth meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group, Subsidiary Body for Implementation, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&lt;/ref&gt; Many developed countries are implementing 'first generation' institutional adaption plans particularly at the state and local government scale.&lt;ref name="EMJ"/&gt; There has also been a push towards joint implementation between countries by the UNFCCC as this has been suggested as a cost-effective way for objectives to be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC (2011) Annual report of the Joint Implementation Supervisory Committee to the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{Main|Climate change in the United States}}
Efforts to reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions by the United States]] include [[energy policy of the United States|energy policies]] which encourage efficiency through programs like [[Energy Star]], [[Commercial Building Integration]], and the [[Industrial Technologies Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/index.html |title=Industrial Technologies Program: BestPractices |publisher=Eere.energy.gov |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 November 1998, Vice President [[Al Gore]] symbolically signed the Kyoto Protocol, but he indicated participation by the developing nations was necessary prior its being submitted for ratification by the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/12/11/kyoto/ |date=1997-12-11 |title=Clinton Hails Global Warming Pact|work= All Politics|publisher= CNN|accessdate=2006-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Transportation Secretary [[Mary Peters (politician)|Mary Peters]], with White House approval, urged governors and dozens of members of the House of Representatives to block California's first-in-the-nation limits on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks, according to e-mails obtained by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/09/25/4099/ "How the White House Worked to Scuttle California's Climate Law"], [[San Francisco Chronicle]], September 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Climate Change Science Program|US Climate Change Science Program]] is a group of about twenty federal agencies and US Cabinet Departments, all working together to address global warming.

The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] pressured American scientists to suppress discussion of global warming, according to the testimony of the Union of Concerned Scientists to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee of the US House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Reuters, January 30, 2007, free archived version at http://www.commondreams.org/headlines07/0130-10.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202012017/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines07/0130-10.htm |date=2007-02-02 }}, last visited Jan. 30, '07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Written testimony of Dr. Grifo before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the US House of Representatives on January 30, 2007, archived at {{cite web|url=http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113153-55829.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805213620/http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20070130113153-55829.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-05 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "High-quality science" was "struggling to get out," as the Bush administration pressured scientists to tailor their writings on global warming to fit the Bush administration's skepticism, in some cases at the behest of an ex-oil industry lobbyist. "Nearly half of all respondents perceived or personally experienced pressure to eliminate the words 'climate change,' 'global warming' or other similar terms from a variety of communications." Similarly, according to the testimony of senior officers of the [[Government Accountability Project]], the White House attempted to bury the report "National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change," produced by US scientists pursuant to US law.&lt;ref&gt;written testimony of Rick Piltz before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the US House of Representatives on January 30, 2007, archived at {{cite web |url=http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113813-92288.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070131202854/http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113813-92288.pdf |archivedate=2007-01-31 |df=}} last visited Jan. 30, 07&lt;/ref&gt; Some US scientists resigned their jobs rather than give in to White House pressure to underreport global warming.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;

In the absence of substantial federal action, state governments have adopted emissions-control laws such as the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] in the Northeast and the [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006]] in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/science/earth/in-california-a-grand-experiment-to-rein-in-climate-change.html |work=The New York Times |first=Felicity |last=Barringer |title=In California, a Grand Experiment to Rein in Climate Change |date=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Developing countries====
In order to reconcile [[economic development]] with mitigating carbon emissions, [[developing countries]] need particular support, both financial and technical. One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund&lt;ref&gt;[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.

An important point of contention, however, is how overseas development assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&amp;title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&amp;nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];
# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;
# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and
# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.
The main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

However, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.

In an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] "which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&amp;Cr=trade&amp;Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-governmental approaches==
While many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.

===Choices in personal actions and business operations===
Environmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]]. Common recommendations include lowering home heating and cooling usage, burning less gasoline, supporting renewable [[energy sources]], buying local products to reduce transportation, turning off unused devices, and various others.

A [[geophysicist]] at [[Utrecht University]] has urged similar institutions to hold the vanguard in voluntary mitigation, suggesting the use of communications technologies such as [[videoconferencing]] to reduce their dependence on long-haul flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Part of the difficulty is that when [[environmental impact of aviation|aviation emissions]] are made at high altitude, the climate impacts are much greater than otherwise. Others have been raising the related concerns of the increasing [[hypermobility (travel)|hypermobility]] of individuals, whether traveling for business or pleasure, involving frequent and often long distance air travel, as well as air shipment of goods.&lt;ref name="gossling"&gt;Gössling S, Ceron JP, Dubois G, Hall CM, Gössling IS, Upham P, [[Earthscan]] London (2009).

===Business opportunities and risks===
{{Main|Business action on climate change}}

On 9 May 2005 [[Jeff Immelt]], the [[chief executive]] of [[General Electric]] (GE), announced plans to reduce GE's global warming related emissions by one percent by 2012. "GE said that given its projected growth, those emissions would have risen by 40 percent without such action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7791657/ |title=Green Electric? GE unveils eco-strategy |publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2005 a group of leading [[airline]]s, [[airport]]s, and [[aerospace]] [[manufacturer]]s pledged to work together to reduce the negative [[environmental impact of aviation]], including limiting the impact of air travel on climate change by improving [[fuel efficiency]] and reducing carbon dioxide emissions of new aircraft by fifty percent per seat kilometre by 2020 from 2000 levels. The group aims to develop a common reporting system for carbon dioxide emissions per aircraft by the end of 2005, and pressed for the early inclusion of aviation in the [[European Union]]'s carbon emission trading scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/747d20ea-e1ff-11d9-bf18-00000e2511c8.html |title=Aviation groups set targets to limit their environmental impact |publisher=FT.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investor response===
{{Main|Fossil fuel divestment}}
Climate change is also a concern for large institutional investors who have a long term time horizon and potentially large exposure to the negative impacts of global warming because of the large geographic footprint of their multi-national holdings. SRI ([[Socially responsible investing]]) Funds allow investors to invest in funds that meet high ESG (environmental, social, governance) standards as such funds invest in companies that are aligned with these goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kiplinger.com/article/investing/T041-C016-S001-5-mutual-funds-for-socially-responsible-investors.html |title=5 Mutual Funds for Socially Responsible Investors |publisher=Kiplinger}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proxy firm]]s can be used to draft guidelines for [[investment manager]]s that take these concerns into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ussif.org/files/publications/institutional_climate.pdf |title=Investing to Curb Climate Change |publisher=USSIF |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a legal action for [[negligence]] (or similar) to succeed, "Plaintiffs ... must show that, more probably than not, their individual injuries were caused by the risk factor in question, as opposed to any other cause. This has sometimes been translated to a requirement of a relative risk of at least two."&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Columbia J. of Env. Law, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Another route (though with little legal bite) is the [[World Heritage Convention]], if it can be shown that climate change is affecting [[World Heritage Site]]s like [[Mount Everest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heatisonline.org/contentserver/objecthandlers/index.cfm?id=4950&amp;method=full |title=Climate change 'ruining' Everest |publisher=Heatisonline.org |date=2004-11-17 |access-date=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2004/11/041117_climate-belize.shtml Climate change 'ruining' Belize] BBC November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides countries suing one another, there are also cases where people in a country have taken legal steps against their own government. Legal action for instance has been taken to try to force the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatelaw.org/cases Climate Justice] Ongoing Cases&lt;/ref&gt; and against the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]] and [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation|OPIC]] for failing to assess environmental impacts (including global warming impacts) under [[NEPA]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

In the Netherlands and Belgium, organisations such as [[Urgenda]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/24/dutch-government-ordered-cut-carbon-emissions-landmark-ruling|title=Dutch government ordered to cut carbon emissions in landmark ruling|first=Arthur Neslen The|last=Hague|date=24 June 2015|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urgenda.nl/themas/klimaat-en-energie/klimaatzaak/|title=Klimaat en Energie – Thema's – Urgenda – Samen Sneller Duurzaam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tegenlicht.vpro.nl/afleveringen/2015-2016/de-klimaatzaak.html|title=VPRO Tegenlicht|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[vzw Klimaatzaak]] in Belgium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/binnenland/2.36678|title=Klimaatzaak|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://klimaatzaak.eu/nl/about/|title=Over ons – Klimaatzaak|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also sued their governments as they believe their governments aren't meeting the emission reductions they agreed to. Urgenda have already won their case against the Dutch government.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

According to a 2004 study commissioned by [[Friends of the Earth]], [[ExxonMobil]], and its predecessors caused 4.7 to 5.3 percent of the world's man-made carbon dioxide emissions between 1882 and 2002. The group suggested that such studies could form the basis for eventual legal action.&lt;ref&gt;Press release (29 January 2004). [http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/exxonmobils_contribution_t_28012004.html Archived press release: Exxonmobil's contribution to global warming revealed]. Friends of the Earth Trust. Retrieved May 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Exxon]] received a subpoena. According to the ''Washington Post'' and confirmed by the company, the attorney general of New York, [[Eric Schneiderman]], opened an investigation into the possibility that the company had misled the public and investors about the risks of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/11/05/exxonmobil-under-investigation-for-misleading-the-public-about-climate-change/ |title=New York is investigating Exxon Mobil for allegedly misleading the public about climate change |publisher=The Washington Post |date=November 5, 2015 |access-date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A consumer-led response to climate change===

Low carbon investment and [[ethical banking]] has been suggested as a tactic to allow consumers to drive a low-carbon transition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A.J.Webster|title=A global consumer-led strategy to tackle climate change|date=July 2018|url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03364}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Roughly 5% of OECD disposable income is saved[https://data.oecd.org/hha/household-savings.htm], and could alternately be saved in low-carbon investment funds to substantially increase overall low-carbon investment. 

Voluntarily funded, low-carbon investment funds have been suggested as a way to provide revenue for adaptation costs in the post-fossil fuel era&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A.J.Webster|title=A global consumer-led strategy to tackle climate change|date=July 2018|url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03364}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is suggested that voluntary donations can be invested, rather than spent, and long-term returns used to pay for adaptation costs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17356">The '''cobweb model''' or '''cobweb theory''' is an [[economic model]] that explains why [[price]]s might be subject to periodic fluctuations in certain types of [[Market (economics)|market]]s. It describes cyclical [[supply and demand]] in a market where the amount [[Production, costs, and pricing|produced]] must be chosen before prices are observed. Producers' [[Expected value|expectation]]s about prices are assumed to be based on observations of previous prices. [[Nicholas Kaldor]] analyzed the model in 1934, coining the term "cobweb theorem" (see Kaldor, 1938 and Pashigian, 2008), citing previous analyses in German by [[Henry Schultz]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Umberto Ricci|it|3=Umberto Ricci (economista)}}.

== The model ==
[[File:Cobweb theory (convergent).svg|thumb|The ''convergent'' case: each new outcome is successively closer to the intersection of supply and demand.]]
[[File:Cobweb theory (divergent).svg|thumb|The ''divergent'' case: each new outcome is successively further from the intersection of supply and demand.]]
The cobweb model is based on a time lag between supply and demand decisions. Agricultural markets are a context where the cobweb model might apply, since there is a lag between planting and [[harvest]]ing (Kaldor, 1934, p.&amp;nbsp;133-134 gives two agricultural examples: rubber and corn). Suppose for example that as a result of unexpectedly bad weather, farmers go to market with an unusually small crop of strawberries. This shortage, equivalent to a leftward shift in the market's [[supply curve]], results in high prices. If farmers expect these high price conditions to continue, then in the following year, they will raise their production of strawberries relative to other crops. Therefore, when they go to market the supply will be high, resulting in low prices. If they then expect low prices to continue, they will decrease their production of strawberries for the next year, resulting in high prices again.

This process is illustrated by the adjacent diagrams. The [[equilibrium price]] is at the intersection of the supply and demand curves. A poor harvest in period&amp;nbsp;1 means supply falls to Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, so that prices rise to P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. If producers plan their period&amp;nbsp;2 production under the expectation that this high price will continue, then the period&amp;nbsp;2 supply will be higher, at Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Prices therefore fall to P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when they try to sell all their output. As this process repeats itself, oscillating between periods of low supply with high prices and then high supply with low prices, the price and quantity trace out a spiral. They may spiral inwards, as in the top figure, in which case the economy converges to the equilibrium where supply and demand cross; or they may spiral outwards, with the fluctuations increasing in magnitude.

The cobweb model can have two types of outcomes:
* If the supply curve is steeper than the demand curve, then the fluctuations decrease in magnitude with each cycle, so a plot of the prices and quantities over time would look like an inward spiral, as shown in the first diagram. This is called the stable or ''convergent'' case.
* If the slope of the supply curve is less than the absolute value of the slope of the demand curve, then the fluctuations increase in magnitude with each cycle, so that prices and quantities spiral outwards. This is called the unstable or ''divergent'' case.

Two other possibilities are:
* Fluctuations may also remain of constant magnitude, so a plot of the outcomes would produce a simple rectangle, if the supply and demand curves have exactly the same slope (in absolute value).
* If the supply curve is less steep than the demand curve near the point where the two curves cross, but more steep when we move sufficiently far away, then prices and quantities will spiral away from the equilibrium price but will not diverge indefinitely; instead, they may converge to a [[limit cycle]].

In either of the first two scenarios, the combination of the spiral and the supply and demand curves often looks like a [[Spider web|cobweb]], hence the name of the theory.

== Elasticities versus slopes ==
The outcomes of the cobweb model are stated above in terms of slopes, but they are more commonly described in terms of elasticities. In terms of slopes, the ''convergent case'' requires that the slope of the supply curve be greater than the absolute value of the slope of the demand curve:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP^S}{dQ^S} &gt; \left|\frac{dP^D}{dQ^D}\right|.&lt;/math&gt;

In standard [[microeconomics]] terminology, define the ''[[Price elasticity of supply|elasticity of supply]]'' as &lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ^S/Q^S}{dP^S/P^S}&lt;/math&gt;, and the ''[[Price elasticity of demand|elasticity of demand]]'' as &lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ^D/Q^D}{dP^D/P^D}&lt;/math&gt;. If we evaluate these two elasticities at the equilibrium point, that is &lt;math&gt;P^S=P^D=P&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q^S=Q^D=Q&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then we see that the ''convergent case'' requires
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ^S/Q}{dP^S/P}&lt;\left|\frac{dQ^D/Q}{dP^D/P}\right|,&lt;/math&gt;
whereas the ''divergent case'' requires
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ^S/Q}{dP^S/P}&gt;\left|\frac{dQ^D/Q}{dP^D/P}\right|.&lt;/math&gt;

In words, the ''convergent case'' occurs when the demand curve is more elastic than the supply curve, at the equilibrium point. The ''divergent case'' occurs when the supply curve is more elastic than the demand curve, at the equilibrium point (see Kaldor, 1934, page 135, propositions (i) and (ii).)

== Role of expectations ==
One reason to be skeptical of this model's predictions is that it assumes producers are extremely shortsighted. Assuming that farmers look back at the most recent prices in order to forecast future prices might seem very reasonable, but this backward-looking forecasting (which is called [[adaptive expectations]]) turns out to be crucial for the model's fluctuations. When farmers expect high prices to continue, they produce too much and therefore end up with low prices, and vice versa.

In the stable case, this may not be an unbelievable outcome, since the farmers' prediction errors (the difference between the price they expect and the price that actually occurs) become smaller every period. In this case, after several periods prices and quantities will come close to the point where supply and demand cross, and predicted prices will be very close to actual prices. But in the unstable case, the farmers' errors get ''larger'' every period. This seems to indicate that [[adaptive expectations]] is a misleading assumption—how could farmers fail to notice that last period's price is ''not'' a good predictor of this period's price?

The fact that [[Agent (economics)|agents]] with adaptive expectations may make ever-increasing errors over time has led many economists to conclude that it is better to assume [[rational expectations]], that is, expectations consistent with the actual structure of the economy. However, the rational expectations assumption is controversial since it may exaggerate agents' understanding of the economy. The cobweb model serves as one of the best examples to illustrate why understanding [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectation]] formation is so important for understanding economic dynamics, and also why expectations are so controversial in recent economic theory.

=== The "Anpassung nach Unten" and "Schraube nach Unten" argument ===
{{Confusing|date=May 2017}}
The German concepts which translate literally "adjustment to lower" and "screw to lower" are known from the works of Hans-Peter Martin and Harald Schumann, the authors of ''[[The Global Trap]]''. Martin and Schumann see the process to worsened living standards as screw-shaped. Mordecai Ezekiel's ''[[The Cobweb Theorem]]'' (1938) illustrate a screw-shaped expectations-driven process.&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel, Mordecai: "The Cobweb Theorem". ''The Quarterly Journal of Economics'', vol. 52, No. 2 (Feb. 1938) pp. 255–280.&lt;/ref&gt; Eino Haikala has analyzed Ezekiel's work among others, and clarified that time constitutes the axis of the screw-shape.&lt;ref&gt;Haikala, Eino: Maatalouden ominaissuhdanteet ja cobweb-teoria (1956). Pellervo.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Martin and Schumann point out that the cobweb theorem works to worsen standards of living as well. The idea of expectations-variation and thus modeled and induced expectations is shown clearly in Oskar Morgenstern's ''Vollkommene Voraussicht und Wirtschaftliches Gleichgewicht''.&lt;ref&gt;Morgenstern, Oskar: Vollkommene Voraussicht und wirtschaftliches Gleichgewicht. Zeitschrift fur Nationalekonomie Bd. 6 (1935) pp. 337–357.&lt;/ref&gt; This article shows also that the concept of perfect foresight (vollkommene Voraussicht) is not a Robert E. Lucas or rational expectations invention but rests in [[game theory]], Morgenstern and John von Neumann being the authors of ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]''. This does not mean that the [[rational expectations|rational expectations hypothesis]] (REH) is not game theory or separate from the cobweb theorem, but vice versa. The "there must be" a random component claim by [[Alan A. Walters]] alone shows that rational (consistent) expectations is game theory,&lt;ref&gt;Walters, Alan A.: "Consistent Expectations, Distributed Lags and the Quantity Theory". ''The Economic Journal'' 81 (322) (Feb. 1971) pp. 273–281.&lt;/ref&gt; since the component is there to create an illusion of [[random walk]].

Alan A. Walters (1971) also claims that "extrapolators" are "unsophisticated", thus differentiating between [[prediction]] and [[forecasting]]. Using induced modeled expectations is prediction, not forecasting, unless these expectations are based on extrapolation. A prediction does not have to even try to be true. To avoid a prediction to be falsified it has to be, according to Franco Modigliani and Emile Grunberg's article "The Predictability of Social Events", kept private.&lt;ref&gt;Modogliani, Franco &amp; Grunberg, Emile: "The Predictability of Social Events". ''Journal of Political Economy'', Vol. 62, No. 6 (Dec. 1954) pp. 465–478.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus public prediction serves private one in REH. Haikala (1956) claims that cobweb theorem is a theorem of deceiving farmers, thus seeing cobweb theorem as a kind of rational or rather, consistent, expectations model with a game-theoretic feature. This makes sense{{Says who|date=February 2017}} when considering the argument of Hans-Peter Martin and Harald Schumann. The [[Truth value|truth-value]] of a prediction is one measure in differentiating between non-deceiving and deceiving models. In Martin and Schumann's context, a claim that anti-Keynesian policies lead to a greater welfare of the majority of mankind should be analyzed in terms of truth. One way to do this is to investigate past historical data. This is contrary to the principles of REH, where the measure of policies is an economic model,&lt;ref&gt;Kydland, Finn E. &amp; Prescott, Edward: Rules Rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans. ''Journal of Political Economy'', Vol. 85, No. 3 (Jun. 1977) pp. 473–492.&lt;/ref&gt; not reality, and credibility, not truth. The importance of intellectual climate emphasized in Friedmans' work&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Milton &amp; Friedman, Rose: Free to Choose.&lt;/ref&gt; means that the credibility of a prediction can be increased by manipulating public opinion, despite its lack of truth. Morgenstern (1935) states that when varying expectations, the expectation of future has always to be positive (and prediction has to be credible).

Expectation is a dynamic component in both REH and cobweb theorem, and the question of expectation formation is the key to Hans-Peter Martin's and Harald Schumann's argument, which deals with trading current welfare for expected future welfare with actually worsening policies in the middle. This 'in order to achieve that then we have to do this now' is the key in [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]]'s work. Cobweb theorem and the rational (consistent) expectations hypothesis are part of [[welfare economics]] which according to Martin and Schumann's argument act now to worsen the welfare of the majority of mankind. [[Nicholas Kaldor's]] work ''The Scourge of Monetarism'' is an analysis of how the policies described by Martin and Schumann came to the United Kingdom.

== Evidence ==

=== Livestock herds ===

The cobweb model has been interpreted as an explanation of fluctuations in various [[livestock]] markets, like those documented by Arthur Hanau in German hog markets; see [[Pork cycle]]. However, Rosen et al. (1994) proposed an alternative model which showed that because of the three-year life cycle of beef cattle, cattle populations would fluctuate over time even if ranchers had perfectly [[rational expectations]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lotterman, [http://www.twincities.com/lotterman/ci_20293708/shipping-cattle-and-some-careers-cycles-play-out "In shipping, cattle and some careers, cycles play out"], Twin Cities Pioneer Press, 4. April 2012: Real World Economics&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human experimental data ===
In 1989, Wellford conducted twelve experimental sessions each conducted with five participants over thirty periods simulating the stable and unstable cases. Her results show that the unstable case did not result in the divergent behavior we see with cobweb expectations but rather the participants converged toward the [[rational expectations]] equilibrium. However, the price path variance in the unstable case was greater than that in the stable case (and the difference was shown to be statistically significant).

One way of interpreting these results is to say that in the [[Long run and short run|long run]], the participants behaved as if they had rational expectations, but that in the short run they made mistakes. These mistakes caused larger fluctuations in the unstable case than in the stable case.

=== Housing sector in Israel ===

The residential construction sector of [[Israel]] was, primarily as a result of [[Bricha|waves of immigration]], and still is, a principal factor in the structure of the [[business cycles]] in Israel. The increasing population, financing methods, higher income, and investment needs converged and came to be reflected through the skyrocketing demand for housing. On the other hand, technology, private and public entrepreneurship, the housing inventory and the availability of workforce have converged on the supply side. The position and direction of the housing sector in the business cycle can be identified by using a cobweb model (see Tamari, 1981).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10288">In [[ethics]], two [[value theory|value]]s (or [[norm (philosophy)|norms]], [[practical reason|reasons]], or [[good and evil|goods]]) are '''incommensurable''' (or incommensurate, or incomparable) when they do not share a common standard of measurement or cannot be compared to each other in a certain way.

There is a cluster of related ideas, and many philosophers use the terms differently. On one common usage:  
* Two '''values''' (for example, freedom and security) are ''incommensurable'' when they cannot be 'traded off' against each other: for example, if there is no set amount of freedom that would compensate for a certain loss of security, or vice versa.  
* Two '''options or choices''' are ''incommensurate'' or ''incomparable'' if and only if: it is not true that one is better, that the other is better, or that they are exactly equally good.  
This page is concerned almost entirely with the second phenomenon. For clarity, the term 'incomparable' is used.

== Trichotomous Comparisons and Small Improvement Arguments ==
In terminology due to [[Ruth Chang]], the three ''trichotomous comparisons'' are betterness, worseness, and equal goodness. For example, one artist, drawing, or cup of coffee might be better or worse than another, or precisely equally as good as it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Ruth|date=2002-07-01|title=The Possibility of Parity|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/339673|journal=Ethics|volume=112|issue=4|pages=659–688|doi=10.1086/339673|issn=0014-1704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When two items are incomparable, none of the trichotomous comparisons holds between them (or at least it seems that way).

The clearest way of arguing that two options are incomparable is a '''small improvement argument.'''

The purpose of such examples is to show that none of the trichotomous comparisons apply. Here is an example. Suppose that (for you, taking everything into account), a certain job as a professor and a certain job as a banker are such that neither seems better than the other. The professor job offers more freedom and security, and the banking job offers more money and excitement. But we might say that though they are good in different ways, they are just too different to be compared with one of the trichotomous comparisons.

Let's suppose that this means that the banking job is not better, and the professor job is not better. This seems to rule out two of the three trichotomous comparisons.

But what about the third? Might the jobs be exactly equally good? The small improvement argument is supposed to show that they could not. Suppose for the sake of argument that they ''are'' precisely equally good.

Suppose also that in order to tempt you, the bankers offer you a tiny pay rise, perhaps 5 cents a year. This new banking job (often called 'banking+') is clearly better than banking, albeit only by a tiny amount. You could (under normal circumstances) never rationally choose banking over banking+: they are the same in every way, except that the latter pays more.

Here is the crux of the small improvement argument: if banking is exactly equally as good as professor, and banking+ is better than banking, then banking+ must be better than professor. But this seems very implausible: if banking and professor were so different that we could not say that professor is better, and we could not say that banking is better, then how could adding 5 cents a year to a huge salary make the difference?

This seems to show that one of our assumptions was incorrect. Defenders of incomparability will say it is most plausible that the assumption that banking and philosophy are equally good that is incorrect. So they conclude that this assumption as false, and thus that none of the trichotomous comparisons apply.

== Theories of Incommensurability ==
There are four main philosophical accounts of incommensurability/incomparability. Their task is to explain (or explain away) the phenomenon, and the small improvement argument. Some philosophers are pluralists about the phenomenon: they think that (for example) genuine incomparability might be the correct account in some cases, and parity in others.

One way to understand the difference between the theories is to see how they respond to the small-improvement argument.

=== Epistemicism about incomparability ===
One possibility is that this is all a mistake: that '''there is no genuine incomparability''', and when it seems like none of the three trichotomous comparisons apply, in fact one of them does but we do not know which. This is where the small-improvement argument goes wrong: one of the trichotomous comparisons ''does'' apply between banking and philosophy.

According to this view, apparent incomparability is merely ignorance. An advantage of this account is that the various puzzles surrounding incomparability dissolve rather quickly. Choice between incomparable options is no more than choice between options when we do not know which is better.

The main objection to this kind of view is that it seems very implausible, for similar reasons to [[Epistemicism|epistemicism about vagueness]]. In particular, it is hard to see how we could be ignorant of the kinds of facts involved in incomparability.

=== Genuine Incomparability ===
Joseph Raz has argued that in cases of incomparability, '''no comparison applies'''. Neither option is better, and they are not equally good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raz|first=Joseph|date=1985|title=Value Incommensurability: Some Preliminaries|jstor=4545040|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society|volume=86|pages=117–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this view, the small-improvement argument is sound.

=== Parity ===
Ruth Chang has argued that (at least some of the time), options may be '''comparable even if they are not trichotomously comparable'''. She does this by denying that the three trichotomous comparisons are the only ones on offer. She defends the existence of a fourth comparison, which she calls 'parity'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Luke Elson has criticised this argument, claiming that the apparent possibility of parity is really an artefact of the vagueness of the (trichotomous) comparisons involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elson|first=Luke|date=2014-04-01|title=Heaps and Chains: Is the Chaining Argument for Parity a Sorites?|url=https://sites.google.com/view/luke-elson/|journal=Ethics|volume=124|issue=3|pages=557–571|doi=10.1086/674844|issn=0014-1704|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Incomparability as Vagueness ===
Finally, a set of philosophers led by [[John Broome (philosopher)|John Broome]] has argued that incomparability is [[vagueness]]. This theory says that it is vague or indeterminate which trichotomous comparison applies.

The argument for this position is complex, and how 'incomparability as vagueness' is to be understood depends on one's theory of vagueness. But the main idea behind the theory is fairly simple. What is the ''precise'' minimum number of grains of sand needed to count as a heap, or hairs required to count as non-bald? If there is no precise number, only a rough range, then these are instances of vagueness. On one set of theories of vagueness, it is ''indeterminate'' how many heaps or hairs are required. Perhaps our language simply does not specify a sharp boundary.

In the small-improvement argument, the incomparability as vagueness view might say that it is indeterminate whether banking is better or worse than philosophy, or precisely equally good.

One taxonomic complication is distinguishing the view that incomparability is vagueness, combined with epistemicism about vagueness, from epistemicism about incomparability.

== Philosophical Implications of Incomparability ==
Incomparability has figured prominently in several philosophical debates concerning moral and rational action. In general, incomparability can add complications to any view according to which one ought to do the best thing that one can, or the better of two options. If the options are incomparable, it may be that neither is better. (Depending on which view of incomparability is true.)

=== Morality ===
[[Consequentialism|Consequentialists]] think that the morally right thing to do is what promotes the most overall good. But if two actions produce incomparable outcomes, it may be that neither is better.

The topic of incommensurability has also frequently arisen in discussions of the version of [[natural law]] theory associated with [[John Finnis]] and others.

=== Rational Choice ===
[[Joseph Raz]] has argued that incommensurability undermines the 'rationalistic' view of human action according to which distinctively rational action is doing what one has most reason to do.&lt;ref&gt;'Incommensurability and Agency' in the Chang book.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical reflection about [[practical reason]] typically aims for a description of the principles relevant in answering the question, "What is to be done in this or that circumstance?" On one popular view, answers to this question can be found by comparing the relative strengths of the various values or norms in play in some given situation. For example, if one is trying to decide on some nice afternoon whether they should stay in to do work or go for a walk, on this view of practical reason they will compare the merits of these two options. If going for a walk is the better or more reasonable course of action, they should put aside their books and go for a stroll. The topic of incommensurability—and the topic of incomparability in particular—is especially important to those who advocate this view of practical reason. For if one's options in certain circumstances are of incomparable value, he or she cannot settle the question of what to do by choosing the better option. When the competing options are incomparable, then by definition neither is better than the other.

The first ingredient in the construction of the Coxeter complex associated to a Coxeter group ''W'' is a certain [[representation (mathematics)|representation]] of ''W'', called the canonical representation of ''W''.

Let &lt;math&gt;(W,S)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Coxeter group|Coxeter system]] associated to ''W'', with [[Coxeter group#Coxeter matrix|Coxeter matrix]] &lt;math&gt; M = (m(s,t))_{s,t \in S}&lt;/math&gt;. The canonical representation is given by a vector space ''V'' with basis of formal symbols &lt;math&gt; (e_s)_{s \in S}&lt;/math&gt;, which is equipped with the symmetric bilinear form &lt;math&gt; B(e_s,e_t) = - \cos \left ( \frac{\pi}{m(s,t)} \right )&lt;/math&gt;. The action of ''W'' on this vector space ''V'' is then given by &lt;math&gt; s(v) = v - 2 \frac{B(e_s,v)}{B(e_s,e_s)}e_s&lt;/math&gt;, as motivated by the expression for reflections in [[root system]]s.

This representation has several foundational properties in the theory of Coxeter groups; for instance, the bilinear form ''B'' is positive definite if and only if ''W'' is finite. It is (always) a [[faithful representation]] of ''W''.

===Chambers and the Tits cone===
One can think of this representation as expressing ''W'' as some sort of reflection group, with the caveat that ''B'' might not be positive definite. It becomes important then to distinguish the representation ''V'' from its dual ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. The vectors &lt;math&gt;e_s&lt;/math&gt; lie in ''V'', and have corresponding dual vectors &lt;math&gt;e_s^\vee&lt;/math&gt; in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, given by:

: &lt;math&gt; \langle e_s^\vee, v \rangle = 2 \frac{B(e_s,v)}{B(e_s,e_s)},&lt;/math&gt;

where the angled brackets indicate the natural pairing of a dual vector in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; with a vector of ''V'', and ''B'' is the bilinear form as above.

Now ''W'' acts on ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, and the action satisfies the formula

: &lt;math&gt; s(f) = f - \langle f, e_s \rangle e_s^\vee, &lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt; s \in S&lt;/math&gt; and any ''f'' in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. This expresses ''s'' as a reflection in the hyperplane &lt;math&gt; H_s = \{ f \in V^*: \langle f, e_s \rangle = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. One has the fundamental chamber &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} = \{ f \in V^* : \langle f, e_s \rangle &gt; 0 \ \forall s \in S \}&lt;/math&gt;, this has faces the so-called walls, &lt;math&gt;H_s&lt;/math&gt;. The other chambers can be obtained from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; by translation: they are the &lt;math&gt; w\mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; w \in W&lt;/math&gt;.

Given a fundamental chamber &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, the '''Tits cone''' is defined to be &lt;math&gt; X = \bigcup_{w \in W} w \overline{\mathcal{C}}&lt;/math&gt;. This need not be the whole of ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. Of major importance is the fact that the Tits cone ''X'' is convex. The action of ''W'' on the Tits cone ''X'' has [[fundamental domain]] the fundamental chamber &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

===The Coxeter complex===
Once one has defined the Tits cone ''X'', the Coxeter complex &lt;math&gt;\Sigma(W,S)&lt;/math&gt; of ''W'' with respect to ''S'' can be defined as the quotient of ''X'', with the origin removed, by the [[positive reals]] (ℝ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, ×):
:&lt;math&gt; \Sigma(W,S) = (X \setminus \{ 0 \}) / \mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
===Finite dihedral groups===
The dihedral groups &lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt; (of order 2''n'') are Coxeter groups, of corresponding type &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{I}_2(n)&lt;/math&gt;. These have the presentation &lt;math&gt; \left \langle s, t \, \left | \, s^2, t^2, (st)^n \right \rangle \right . &lt;/math&gt;.

The canonical linear representation of &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{I}_2(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the usual reflection representation of the dihedral group, as acting on a ''n''-gon in the plane (so &lt;math&gt; V = \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; in this case). For instance, in the case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, we get the Coxeter group of type &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{I}_2(3) = \mathrm{A}_2&lt;/math&gt;, acting on an equilateral triangle in the plane. Each reflection ''s'' has an associated hyperplane ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; in the dual vector space (which can be canonically identified with the vector space itself using the bilinear form ''B'', which is an inner product in this case as remarked above), these are the walls. They cut out chambers, as seen below:

[[File:Spherical dihedral complex.svg | 300px]]

The Coxeter complex is then the corresponding 2''n''-gon, as in the image above. This is a simplicial complex of dimension 1, and it can be colored by cotype.

===The infinite dihedral group===
Another motivating example is the [[infinite dihedral group]] &lt;math&gt; D_{\infty} &lt;/math&gt;. This can be seen as the group of symmetries of the real line that preserves the set of points with integer coordinates; it is generated by the reflections in &lt;math&gt; x= 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x = {1 \over 2} &lt;/math&gt;. This group has the Coxeter presentation &lt;math&gt; \left \langle s, t \, \left | \, s^2, t^2 \right \rangle \right . &lt;/math&gt;.

In this case, it is no longer possible to identify ''V'' with the dual space ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, as ''B'' is not positive definite. It is then better to work solely with ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, which is where the hyperplanes are defined. This then gives the following picture:

[[Image:Affine dihedral complex.svg|300px]]

In this case, the Tits cone is not the whole plane, but only the upper half plane. Quotienting out by the positive reals then yields another copy of the real line, with marked points at the integers. This is the Coxeter complex of the infinite dihedral group.

==Alternative construction of the Coxeter complex==
Another description of the Coxeter complex uses standard cosets of the Coxeter group ''W''. A standard coset is a coset of the form &lt;math&gt; w W_J &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; W_J = \langle J \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for some subset ''J'' of ''S''. For instance, &lt;math&gt; W_S = W &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; W_\emptyset = \{1\}&lt;/math&gt;. 

The Coxeter complex &lt;math&gt; \Sigma(W,S) &lt;/math&gt; is then the [[poset]] of standard cosets, ordered by reverse inclusion. This has a canonical structure of a simplicial complex, as do all posets that satisfy:
*Any two elements have a greatest lower bound.
*The poset of elements less than or equal to any given element is isomorphic to the poset of subsets of &lt;math&gt; \{1, 2, \ldots, n \}&lt;/math&gt; for some integer&amp;nbsp;''n''.

==Properties==
The Coxeter complex associated to &lt;math&gt;(W,S)&lt;/math&gt; has dimension &lt;math&gt;|S|-1&lt;/math&gt;. It is homeomorphic to a &lt;math&gt;(|S|-1)&lt;/math&gt;-sphere if ''W'' is finite and is [[contractible space|contractible]] if ''W'' is infinite.

In ordinary language, a '''crime''' is an unlawful act punishable by a [[Forms of government|state]] or other authority.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |chapter=Crime}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "crime" does not, in modern [[criminal law]], have any simple and universally accepted definition,&lt;ref name="Farmer"&gt;Farmer, Lindsay: "Crime, definitions of", in Cane and Conoghan (editors), ''[[The New Oxford Companion to Law]]'', Oxford University Press, 2008 ({{ISBN|978-0199290543}}), p. 263 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=xjo5AQAAIAAJ Google Books]).&lt;/ref&gt; though [[statutory]] definitions have been provided for certain purposes.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, for instance, the definitions provided by section 243(2) of the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]] and by the Schedule to the [[Prevention of Crimes Act 1871]].&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular view is that crime is a [[Category of being|category]] created by [[law]]; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law.&lt;ref name="Farmer"/&gt; One proposed definition is that a crime or '''offence''' (or '''criminal offence''') is an act harmful not only to some individual but also to a community, society or the state ("a public [[wrong]]"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.&lt;ref name="oed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oxdic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Dictionary of Law |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0198607564 |author=Elizabeth A. Martin |edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion that acts such as [[murder]], [[rape]] and [[theft]] are to be prohibited exists worldwide.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |last=Easton |first=Mark |title=What is crime? |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markeaston/2010/06/what_is_crime.html |accessdate=10 June 2013 |newspaper=BBC News |date=17 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227042428/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markeaston/2010/06/what_is_crime.html |archivedate=27 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by [[criminal law]] of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the [[criminal code]], in some [[Common law (legal system)|common law]] countries no such comprehensive statute exists.

The state ([[Forms of government|government]]) has the power to severely restrict one's [[liberty]] for committing a crime. In [[Contemporary society|modern societies]], there are [[Criminal procedure|procedures]] to which investigations and [[trial]]s must adhere. If found [[Guilt (law)|guilty]], an offender may be [[Sentence (law)|sentenced]] to a form of reparation such as a [[community sentence]], or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo [[imprisonment]], [[life imprisonment]] or, in some [[jurisdiction]]s, [[Capital punishment|execution]].

Usually, to be classified as a crime, the "act of doing something criminal" (''[[actus reus]]'') must{{snd}}with [[Strict liability|certain exceptions]]{{snd}}be accompanied by the "intention to do something criminal" (''[[mens rea]]'').&lt;ref name="oxdic"/&gt;

While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of [[private law]] ([[tort]]s and [[breach of contract|breaches of contract]]) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through [[civil procedure]].

== Overview ==

When informal relationships and sanctions prove insufficient to establish and maintain a desired [[social order]], a government or a [[state (polity)|state]] may impose more formalized or stricter systems of [[social control]]. With institutional and legal machinery at their disposal, agents of the [[State (polity)|State]] can compel [[population]]s to conform to codes and can opt to punish or attempt to reform those who do not conform.

Authorities employ various mechanisms to regulate (encouraging or discouraging) certain behaviors in general. Governing or administering agencies may for example codify rules into laws, police citizens and visitors to ensure that they comply with those laws, and implement other policies and practices that legislators or administrators have prescribed with the aim of discouraging or [[crime prevention|preventing crime]]. In addition, authorities provide [[Legal remedy|remedies]] and [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]], and collectively these constitute a [[criminal justice]] system. Legal sanctions vary widely in their severity; they may include (for example) incarceration of temporary character aimed at reforming the convict. Some jurisdictions have penal codes written to inflict permanent harsh punishments: legal [[mutilation]], [[capital punishment]] or [[life imprisonment|life without parole]].

Usually, a [[natural person]] perpetrates a crime, but [[legal personality|legal persons]] may also commit crimes. Conversely, at least under U.S. law, nonpersons such as animals cannot commit crimes.&lt;ref&gt;''People v. Frazier'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA4/173CA4t613.htm 173 Cal. App. 4th 613] (2009). In this case, the California Court of Appeal explained: "Despite the physical ability to commit vicious and violent acts, dogs do not possess the legal ability to commit crimes."&lt;/ref&gt;

The sociologist [[Richard Quinney]] has written about the relationship between society and crime. When Quinney states "crime is a social phenomenon" he envisages both how individuals conceive crime and how populations perceive it, based on societal norms.&lt;ref&gt;Quinney, Richard, "Structural Characteristics, Population Areas, and Crime Rates in the United States," ''The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology and Police Science'', 57(1), pp. 45–52&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The word ''crime'' is derived from the [[Latin]] root ''cernō'', meaning "I decide, I give judgment". Originally the Latin word ''crīmen'' meant "[[criminal charge|charge]]" or "cry of distress."&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Klein, [https://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Etymological-Dictionary-English-Language/dp/0444409300 ''Klein's Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322101740/http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Etymological-Dictionary-English-Language/dp/0444409300 |date=2016-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Greek]] word ''krima'' (κρίμα), from which the Latin cognate derives, typically referred to an intellectual mistake or an offense against the community, rather than a private or moral wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Bakaoukas, Michael. "The conceptualisation of 'Crime' in Classical Greek Antiquity: From the ancient Greek 'crime' (krima) as an intellectual error to the christian 'crime' (crimen) as a moral sin." ERCES ( European and International research group on crime, Social Philosophy and Ethics). 2005. {{cite web |url=http://www.erces.com/journal/articles/archives/volume2/v02/v02.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928085421/http://www.erces.com/journal/articles/archives/volume2/v02/v02.htm |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 13th century [[English language|English]] ''crime'' meant "sinfulness", according to [[online Etymology Dictionary|etymonline.com]]. It was probably brought to England as Old French ''crimne'' (12th century form of [[French language|Modern French]] ''crime''), from Latin ''crimen'' (in the genitive case: ''criminis''). In Latin, ''crimen'' could have signified any one of the following: "[[Criminal charge|charge]], [[indictment]], [[Criminal accusation|accusation]]; crime, [[fault (legal)|fault]], offense".

The word may derive from the Latin ''cernere'' – "to decide, to sift" (see [[crisis]], mapped on [[Kairos]] and [[Chronos]]). But [[Ernest Klein]] (citing [[Karl Brugmann]]) rejects this and suggests *cri-men, which originally would have meant "cry of distress". Thomas G. Tucker suggests a root in "[[crying|cry]]" words and refers to English [[plaintiff|plaint]], [[plaintiff]], and so on. The meaning "offense punishable by law" dates from the late 14th century. The Latin word is [[Gloss (annotation)|glossed]] in Old English by ''facen'', also "deceit, fraud, treachery", [cf. fake]. ''Crime wave'' is first attested in 1893 in [[American English]].

== Definition ==

=== England and Wales ===

Whether a given act or omission constitutes a crime does not depend on the nature of that act or omission. It depends on the nature of the legal consequences that may follow it.&lt;ref&gt;''Seaman v Burley'' [1896] 2 QB, per Lord Esher MR at 346&lt;/ref&gt; An act or omission is a crime if it is capable of being followed by what are called criminal proceedings.&lt;ref name="Law, Eleventh Edition 1982, page 3"&gt;[[Glanville Williams]], ''Learning the Law'', Eleventh Edition, Stevens, 1982, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1 of "Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law" (13th Ed by Ormerod) discusses the various proposed definitions of "crime" in more detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History'''

The following definition of "crime" was provided by the Prevention of Crimes Act 1871, and applied&lt;ref&gt;The [[Prevention of Crime Act 1908]], section 10(6) and Schedule&lt;/ref&gt; for the purposes of section 10 of the Prevention of Crime Act 1908:

{{Blockquote|The expression "crime" means, in England and Ireland, any [[felony]] or the offence of [[uttering]] false or counterfeit coin, or of possessing counterfeit gold or silver coin, or the offence of obtaining goods or money by [[false pretences]], or the offence of [[conspiracy to defraud]], or any [[misdemeanour]] under the fifty-eighth section of the [[Larceny Act 1861|Larceny Act, 1861]].}}

=== Scotland ===

For the purpose of section 243 of the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]], a crime means an offence punishable on [[indictment]], or an offence punishable on [[summary conviction]], and for the commission of which the offender is liable under the [[statute]] making the offence punishable to be imprisoned either absolutely or at the discretion of the court as an alternative for some other punishment.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/52/section/243 section 243(2)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111200051/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/52/section/243 |date=2012-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociology ===

A [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] [[definition]] views crime as [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]] that violates prevailing [[norm (sociology)|norms]]{{spaced ndash}}[[culture|cultural]] standards prescribing how humans ought to behave normally. This approach considers the complex realities surrounding the concept of crime and seeks to understand how changing [[society|social]], [[politics|political]], [[psychology|psychological]], and [[economics|economic]] conditions may affect changing definitions of crime and the form of the legal, [[Police|law-enforcement]], and penal responses made by society.

These [[structuralism|structural]] realities remain fluid and often contentious. For example: as cultures change and the political environment shifts, societies may [[criminalisation|criminalise]] or [[decriminalisation|decriminalise]] certain behaviours, which directly affects the [[statistics|statistical]] [[crime rate]]s, influence the allocation of resources for the enforcement of laws, and (re-)influence the general [[public opinion]].

Similarly, changes in the collection and/or calculation of data on crime may affect the public perceptions of the extent of any given "crime problem". All such adjustments to [[crime statistics]], allied with the experience of people in their everyday lives, shape attitudes on the extent to which the State should use law or [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] to enforce or encourage any particular [[social norm]]. Behaviour can be controlled and influenced by a society in many ways without having to resort to the criminal justice system.

Indeed, in those cases where no clear [[consensus]] exists on a given norm, the drafting of [[criminal law]] by the group in [[power (sociology)|power]] to prohibit the behaviour of another group may seem to some observers an improper limitation of the second group's [[Political freedom|freedom]], and the ordinary members of society have less respect for the law or laws in general{{snd}}whether the authorities actually enforce the disputed law or not.

=== Other definitions ===

[[Legislature]]s can pass laws (called [[Malum prohibitum|''mala prohibita'']]) that define crimes against social norms. These laws vary from time to time and from place to place: note variations in [[gambling]] laws, for example, and the prohibition or encouragement of [[duelling]] in history. Other crimes, called [[Malum in se|''mala in se'']], count as outlawed in almost all societies, ([[murder]], [[theft]] and [[rape]], for example).

[[English criminal law]] and the related criminal law of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries can define offences that the courts alone have developed over the years, without any actual legislation: [[common law offence]]s. The courts used the concept of ''[[malum in se]]'' to develop various common law offences.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Law Dictionary'', John A. Yogis, Q.C., Barrons: 2003
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criminalization ==
{{Main article| Criminalization}}
[[File:Traitors heads on old london bridge.jpg|thumb|The spiked heads of executed criminals once adorned the gatehouse of the medieval [[London Bridge]].]]
One can view criminalization as a procedure deployed by society as a preemptive harm-reduction device, using the threat of punishment as a [[Deterrence (legal)|deterrent]] to anyone proposing to engage in the behavior causing harm. The State becomes involved because governing entities can become convinced that the costs of not criminalizing (through allowing the harms to continue unabated) outweigh the costs of criminalizing it (restricting individual [[liberty]], for example, to minimize harm to others).

States control the process of criminalization because:
* Even if [[victimology|victims]] recognize their own role as victims, they may not have the resources to investigate and seek legal redress for the injuries suffered: the enforcers formally appointed by the State often have better access to expertise and resources.
* The victims may only want compensation for the injuries suffered, while remaining indifferent to a possible desire for [[deterrence (psychology)|deterrence]].&lt;ref&gt;See Polinsky &amp; Shavell (1997) on the fundamental divergence between the private and the social motivation for using the legal system.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fear of [[retaliate|retaliation]] may deter victims or witnesses of crimes from taking any action. Even in policed societies, fear may inhibit from reporting incidents or from co-operating in a [[Trial (law)|trial]].
* Victims, on their own, may lack the economies of scale that could allow them to administer a penal system, let alone to collect any fines levied by a court.&lt;ref&gt;See Polinsky (1980) on the enforcement of fines&lt;/ref&gt; Garoupa &amp; Klerman (2002) warn that a [[rent-seeking]] government has as its primary motivation to maximize revenue and so, if offenders have sufficient wealth, a rent-seeking government will act more aggressively than a [[social welfare function|social-welfare]]-maximizing government in enforcing laws against minor crimes (usually with a fixed penalty such as parking and routine traffic violations), but more laxly in enforcing laws against major crimes.
* As a result of the crime, victims may die or become incapacitated.

== Labelling theory ==
{{further|Labeling theory#The "criminal"}}

The [[Labeling theory|label]] of "crime" and the accompanying [[social stigma]] normally confine their scope to those activities seen as injurious to the general population or to the State, including some that cause serious loss or damage to individuals. Those who apply the labels of "crime" or "criminal" intend to assert the [[hegemony]] of a dominant population, or to reflect a consensus of condemnation for the identified behavior and to justify any punishments prescribed by the State (in the event that [[due process|standard processing]] [[trial (law)|tries]] and [[conviction (law)|convicts]] an accused person of a crime).

== Natural-law theory ==

Justifying the State's use of [[coercion|force]] to coerce compliance with its laws has proven a consistent theoretical problem. One of the earliest justifications involved the theory of [[natural law]]. This posits that the nature of the world or of human beings underlies the standards of [[morality]] or constructs them. [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote in the 13th century: "the rule and measure of human acts is the [[reason]], which is the first principle of human acts" (Aquinas, ST I-II, Q.90, A.I). He regarded people as by nature [[rationality|rational]] beings, concluding that it becomes morally appropriate that they should behave in a way that conforms to their rational nature. Thus, to be valid, any law must conform to natural law and coercing people to conform to that law is morally acceptable. In the 1760s [[William Blackstone]] (1979: 41) described the thesis:

: "This law of nature, being co-eval with mankind and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original."

But [[John Austin (legal philosophy)|John Austin]] (1790–1859), an early [[Legal positivism|positivist]], applied [[utilitarianism]] in accepting the calculating nature of human beings and the existence of an objective morality. He denied that the legal validity of a norm depends on whether its content conforms to morality. Thus in Austinian terms a moral code can objectively determine what people ought to do, the law can embody whatever norms the legislature decrees to achieve social utility, but every individual remains free to choose what to do. Similarly, [[H. L. A. Hart|Hart]] (1961) saw the law as an aspect of [[sovereignty]], with lawmakers able to adopt any law as a means to a moral end.

Thus the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of a proposition of law simply involved internal [[logic]] and [[consistency]], and that the state's agents used state power with [[Social responsibility|responsibility]]. [[Ronald Dworkin]] (2005) rejects Hart's theory and proposes that all individuals should expect the equal respect and concern of those who govern them as a fundamental political right. He offers a theory of compliance overlaid by a theory of [[deference]] (the citizen's duty to obey the law) and a theory of enforcement, which identifies the legitimate goals of enforcement and punishment. Legislation must conform to a theory of legitimacy, which describes the circumstances under which a particular person or group is entitled to make law, and a theory of legislative justice, which describes the law they are entitled or obliged to make.

Indeed, despite everything, the majority{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} of natural-law theorists have accepted the idea of enforcing the prevailing morality as a primary function of the law. This view entails the problem that it makes any moral criticism of the law impossible: if conformity with natural law forms a necessary condition for legal validity, all valid law must, by definition, count as morally just. Thus, on this line of reasoning, the legal validity of a norm necessarily entails its moral justice.{{Clarify|date=December 2009|reason=see talk page 'Natural-law theory P5'}}

One can solve this problem by granting some degree of [[moral relativism]] and accepting that norms may evolve over time and, therefore, one can criticize the continued enforcement of old laws in the light of the current norms. People may find such law acceptable, but the use of State power to coerce citizens to comply with that law lacks moral justification. More recent conceptions of the theory characterise crime as the violation of [[individual and group rights|individual rights]].

Since society considers so many rights as natural (hence the term "[[rights|right]]") rather than man-made, what constitutes a crime also counts as natural, in contrast to laws (seen as man-made). [[Adam Smith]] illustrates this view, saying that a [[smuggling|smuggler]] would be an excellent citizen, "...had not the laws of his country made that a crime which nature never meant to be so."

Natural-law theory therefore distinguishes between "criminality" (which derives from human nature) and "illegality" (which originates with the interests of those in [[power (sociology)|power]]). Lawyers sometimes express the two concepts with the phrases ''[[malum in se]]'' and ''[[malum prohibitum]]'' respectively. They regard a "crime ''malum in se''" as inherently criminal; whereas a "crime ''malum prohibitum''" (the argument goes) counts as criminal only because the law has decreed it so.

It follows from this view that one can perform an illegal act without committing a crime, while a criminal act could be perfectly legal. Many [[age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers (such as Adam Smith and the American [[List of national founders|Founding Fathers]]) subscribed to this view to some extent, and it remains influential among so-called [[Liberalism#Classical and modern|classical liberals]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

== History ==
Some religious communities regard [[sin]] as a crime; some may even highlight the crime of sin very early in legendary or mythological accounts of origins{{snd}}note the tale of [[Adam and Eve]] and the theory of [[original sin]]. What one group considers a crime may cause or ignite war or conflict. However, the earliest known [[civilization]]s had codes of [[law]], containing both [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and penal rules mixed together, though not always in recorded form.

The [[Sumer]]ians produced the earliest surviving written codes.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urukagina]] (reigned {{Circa|2380 BC|2360 BC}}, [[short chronology timeline|short chronology]]) had an early code that has not survived; a later king, [[Ur-Nammu]], left the earliest extant written law system, the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] ({{c.|lk=no|2100|2050 BC}}), which prescribed a formal system of penalties for specific cases in 57 articles. The Sumerians later issued other codes, including the "code of [[Lipit-Ishtar]]". This code, from the 20th century BCE, contains some fifty articles, and scholars have reconstructed it by comparing several sources. {{quote|The Sumerian was deeply conscious of his personal rights and resented any encroachment on them, whether by his King, his superior, or his equal. No wonder that the Sumerians were the first to compile laws and law codes.| Kramer&lt;ref&gt;
Kramer (1971: 4)
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Successive legal codes in [[Babylon]], including the [[code of Hammurabi]] (c. 1790 BC), reflected [[Mesopotamia]]n society's belief that law derived from the will of the [[deity|gods]] (see [[Babylonian law]]).&lt;ref&gt;
Driver and Mills (1952–55) and Skaist (1994)
&lt;/ref&gt;
Many states at this time functioned as [[theocracy|theocracies]], with codes of conduct largely religious in origin or reference. In the Sanskrit texts of [[Dharmaśāstra]] ({{c.|lk=no|1250 BC}}), issues such as legal and religious duties, code of conduct, penalties and remedies, etc. have been discussed and forms one of the elaborate and earliest source of legal code.&lt;ref&gt;
Anuradha Jaiswal, ''Criminal Justice Tenets of Manusmriti – A Critique of the Ancient Hindu Code''
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, Patrick. 2004. ''The Law Code of Manu''. New York: Oxford UP.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Henry Maine]] (1861) studied the ancient codes available in his day, and failed to find any criminal law in the "modern" sense of the word. While modern systems distinguish between offences against the "State" or "community", and offences against the "individual", the so-called penal law of ancient communities did not deal with "crimes" (Latin: ''crimina''), but with "wrongs" (Latin: ''delicta''). Thus the Hellenic laws&lt;ref&gt;Gagarin: 1986; and Garner: 1987&lt;/ref&gt; treated all forms of [[theft]], [[assault]], [[rape]], and murder as private wrongs, and left action for enforcement up to the victims or their survivors. The earliest systems seem to have lacked formal courts.

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] systematized law and applied their system across the [[Roman Empire]]. Again, the initial rules of [[Roman law]] regarded assaults as a matter of private compensation. The most significant Roman law concept involved ''dominion''.&lt;ref&gt;Daube: 1969&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[pater familias]]'' owned all the family and its property (including slaves); the ''pater'' enforced matters involving interference with any property. The ''Commentaries'' of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] (written between 130 and 180 AD) on the [[Twelve Tables]] treated ''furtum'' (in modern parlance: "theft") as a [[tort]].

Similarly, assault and violent [[robbery]] involved [[trespass]] as to the ''pater's'' property (so, for example, the rape of a slave could become the subject of compensation to the ''pater'' as having trespassed on his "property"), and breach of such laws created a ''vinculum juris'' (an obligation of law) that only the payment of monetary compensation (modern "[[damages]]") could discharge. Similarly, the consolidated [[Germanic law|Teutonic laws]] of the [[Germanic tribes]],&lt;ref&gt;Guterman: 1990&lt;/ref&gt; included a complex system of monetary compensations for what courts would {{As of| 2008 | alt = now}} consider the complete{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} range of criminal offences against the person, from murder down.

Even though Rome abandoned its [[Roman Britain|Britannic provinces]] around 400 AD, the Germanic mercenaries{{spaced ndash}}who had largely become instrumental in enforcing Roman rule in Britannia{{spaced ndash}}acquired ownership of land there and continued to use a mixture of Roman and Teutonic Law, with much written down under the early [[Anglo-Saxon kings]].&lt;ref&gt;Attenborough: 1963&lt;/ref&gt; But only when a more centralized English monarchy emerged following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]], and when the kings of England attempted to assert power over the land and its peoples, did the modern concept emerge, namely of a crime not only as an offence against the "individual", but also as a wrong against the "State".&lt;ref&gt;
Kern: 1948; Blythe: 1992; and Pennington: 1993
&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea came from [[common law]], and the earliest conception of a criminal act involved events of such major significance that the "State" had to usurp the usual functions of the civil tribunals, and direct a special law or ''privilegium'' against the perpetrator. All the earliest English criminal trials involved wholly extraordinary and arbitrary courts without any settled law to apply, whereas the civil (delictual) law operated in a highly developed and consistent manner (except where a king wanted to raise money by selling a new form of [[writ]]). The development of the idea that the "State" dispenses [[justice]] in a court only emerges in parallel with or after the emergence of the concept of [[sovereignty]].

In continental Europe, Roman law persisted, but with a stronger influence from the Christian Church.&lt;ref&gt;Vinogradoff (1909); Tierney: 1964, 1979
&lt;/ref&gt;
Coupled with the more diffuse political structure based on smaller feudal units, various legal traditions emerged, remaining more strongly rooted in Roman [[jurisprudence]], but modified to meet the prevailing [[political climate]].

In Scandinavia the effect of Roman law did not become apparent until the 17th century, and the courts grew out of the ''[[thing (assembly)|things]]''{{snd}}the assemblies of the people. The people decided the cases (usually with largest freeholders dominating). This system later gradually developed into a system with a royal judge nominating a number of the most esteemed men of the parish as his board, fulfilling the function of "the people" of yore.

From the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] system onwards, the policy rationale for requiring the payment of monetary compensation for wrongs committed has involved the avoidance of [[feud]]ing between [[clan]]s and [[family|families]].&lt;ref&gt;
The concept of the ''pater familias'' acted as a unifying factor in extended kin groups, and the later practice of ''[[weregild|wergild]]'' functioned in this context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
If compensation could mollify families' feelings, this would help to keep the peace. On the other hand, the institution of oaths also played down the threat of [[endemic warfare|feudal warfare]]. Both in archaic Greece and in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Scandinavia]], an accused person walked free if he could get a sufficient number of male relatives to swear him not guilty. (Compare the [[United Nations Security Council]], in which the [[veto]] power of the permanent members ensures that the organization does not become involved in crises where it could not enforce its decisions.)

These means of restraining private [[feud]]s did not always work, and sometimes prevented the fulfillment of justice. But in the earliest times the "state" did not always provide an independent policing force. Thus criminal law grew out of what 21st-century lawyers would call torts; and, in real terms, many acts and omissions classified as crimes actually overlap with civil-law concepts.

The development of [[sociology|sociological]] thought from the 19th century onwards prompted some fresh views on crime and criminality, and fostered the beginnings of [[criminology]] as a study of crime in society. [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] noted a link between crime and [[creativity]]{{spaced ndash}}in ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' he asserted&lt;!-- in what context? --&gt;:{{Context inline|date=November 2016}} "The best and brightest that man can acquire he must obtain by crime". In the 20th century [[Michel Foucault]] in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' made a study of [[criminalization]] as a coercive method of state control.

== Classification and categorisation ==
{{Globalize|section|date=January 2010}}

=== Categorisation by type ===

The following classes of offences are used, or have been used, as legal terms of art:{{clarify|date=May 2016}}
* [[Offence against the person]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;For example, by the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Violent crime|Violent offence]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;For example, by section 31(1) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1991]], and by the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sex and the law|Sexual offence]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
* [[Property crime|Offence against property]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Researchers and commentators have classified crimes into the following categories, in addition to those above:
* [[Forgery]], [[personation]] and [[cheating (law)|cheating]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 22&lt;/ref&gt;
* Firearms and offensive weapons&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 24&lt;/ref&gt;
* Offences against the State/offences against the Crown and Government&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt;/political offences&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Card, Cross and Jones: Criminal Law]]'', 12th ed, 1992, chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Drug-related crime|Harmful or dangerous drugs]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 26&lt;/ref&gt;
* Offences against [[religion]] and public worship&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 27&lt;/ref&gt;
* Offences against public justice&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 28&lt;/ref&gt;/offences against the administration of public justice&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Card, Cross and Jones: Criminal Law]]'', 12th ed, 1992, chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Public-order crime|Public order offence]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 29&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Corporate crime|Commerce]], [[financial market]]s and [[insolvency]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 30&lt;/ref&gt;
* Offences against [[public morality|public morals]] and [[public policy]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 31&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Traffic code|Motor vehicle offences]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 32&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Conspiracy (criminal)|Conspiracy]], [[incitement]] and [[attempt]] to commit crime&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 33&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Inchoate offense|Inchoate offence]]
* [[Juvenile delinquency]]
* [[Victimless crime]]

=== Categorisation by penalty ===

One can categorise crimes depending on the related punishment, with [[sentence (law)|sentencing]] [[tariff]]s prescribed in line with the perceived seriousness of the offence. Thus [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] and noncustodial sentences may address the crimes seen as least serious, with lengthy imprisonment or (in some jurisdictions) [[capital punishment]] reserved for the most serious.

=== Common law ===

Under the common law of England, crimes were classified as either [[treason]], [[felony]] or [[misdemeanour]], with treason sometimes being included with the felonies. This system was based on the perceived seriousness of the offence. It is still used in the United States but the distinction between felony and misdemeanour is abolished in England and Wales and Northern Ireland.

=== Classification by mode of trial ===

The following classes of offence are based on [[mode of trial]]:
* [[Indictable-only offence]]
* [[Indictable offence]]
* [[Hybrid offence]], a.k.a. either-way offence in England and Wales
* [[Summary offence]], a.k.a. [[summary offence|infraction]] in the US

=== Classification by origin ===

In common law countries, crimes may be categorised into [[common law offences]] and [[statutory]] offences. In the US, Australia and Canada (in particular), they are divided into [[federal crime]]s and under state crimes.

=== Other classifications ===
* [[Arrestable offence]]

=== U.S. classification ===
[[File:Felony Sentences in State Courts.pdf|thumb|''Felony Sentences in State Courts'', study by the [[United States Department of Justice]].]]
In the United States since 1930, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has tabulated [[Uniform Crime Reports]] (UCR) annually from crime data submitted by [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] agencies across the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm |title=FBI: Uniform Crime Reports |publisher=Fbi.gov |accessdate=2013-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041024015252/https://www.fbi.gov//ucr/ucr.htm |archivedate=2004-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Officials compile this data at the city, county, and [[U.S. state|state]] levels into the UCR. They classify violations of laws based on [[common law]] as Part I (index) crimes in UCR data. These are further categorized as violent or property crimes. Part I violent crimes include murder and criminal homicide (voluntary manslaughter), forcible rape, aggravated assault, and robbery; while Part I property crimes include burglary, arson, larceny/theft, and motor-vehicle theft. All other crimes count come under Part II.

For convenience, such lists usually include [[summary offense|infractions]] although, in the U.S., they may come into the sphere not of the criminal law, but rather of the [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]]. Compare [[tort]]feasance.

Booking [[arrest]]s require detention for a time-frame ranging 1 to 24 hours.

==Reports, studies and organizations==
There are several national and International organizations offering studies and statistics about global and local crime activity, such as [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], the United States of America Overseas Security Advisory Council ([[OSAC]]) safety report or national reports generated by the law-enforcement authorities of EU state member reported to the [[Europol]].

== Offence in common law jurisdictions ==

In England and Wales, as well as in Hong Kong, the term "offence" means the same thing as, and is interchangeable with, the term "[[Crime#England and Wales|crime]]",&lt;ref name="Law, Eleventh Edition 1982, page 3"/&gt; They are further split into:
* [[Summary offence]]s
* [[Indictable offence]]s

== Causes and correlates of crime ==
{{main article|Causes and correlates of crime}}

Many different [[correlates of crime|causes and correlates of crime]] have been proposed with varying degree of empirical support. They include socioeconomic, psychological, biological, and behavioral factors. Controversial topics include [[media violence research]] and effects of [[gun politics]].

Emotional state (both chronic and current) have a tremendous impact on individual thought processes and, as a result, can be linked to criminal activities. The positive psychology concept of Broaden and Build posits that cognitive functioning expands when an individual is in a good-feeling emotional state and contracts as emotional state declines.&lt;ref&gt;Fredrickson, B.L. (2005). Positive Emotions broaden the scope of attention and though-action repertoires. Cognition and Emotion, 19: 313–332.&lt;/ref&gt; In positive emotional states an individual is able to consider more possible solutions to problems, but in lower emotional states fewer solutions can be ascertained. The narrowed thought-action repertoires can result in the only paths perceptible to an individual being ones they would never use if they saw an alternative, but if they can't conceive of the alternatives that carry less risk they will choose one that they can see. Criminals who commit even the most horrendous of crimes, such as mass murders, did not see another solution.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R.F. (2012). Human Evil: The myth of pure evil and the true causes of violence. In A.P. Association, M. Mikulincer, &amp; P.R. Shaver (Eds.), The social psychology of morality: Exploring the causes of good and evil (pp. 367–380). Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crimes in international law ==
{{Main article|International criminal law}}
[[File:Kang Kek Iew (Kaing Guek Eav or Duch) before the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia - 20090720.jpg|thumb|[[Kang Kek Iew]] before the [[Cambodian Genocide Tribunal]] on July 20, 2009]]
Crimes defined by [[treaty]] as crimes against international law include:
* [[Crime against peace|Crimes against peace]]
* [[Crime of apartheid|Crimes of apartheid]]
* [[Forced disappearance]]
* [[Genocide]]
* [[Piracy]]
* [[Sexual slavery]]
* [[Slavery]]
* Waging a [[war of aggression]]
* [[War crime]]s

From the point of view of state-centric law, extraordinary procedures (usually [[international court]]s) may prosecute such crimes. Note the role of the [[International Criminal Court]] at [[The Hague]] in the [[Netherlands]].

== Religion and crime ==
{{main article|Religious law}}
{{category see also|Crimes in religion}}
[[File:Hep-hep riots.jpg|thumb|alt= Two peasant women are assaulting a Jewish man with pitchfork and broom. A man wearing spectacles, tails, and a six-button waistcoat, perhaps a pharmacist or a schoolteacher, holds another Jewish man by the throat and is about to hit him with a stick, while a woman in a window above him throws the wet and solid contents of a basin at him, possibly the contents of a chamberpot. More chaos can be seen in the background, including a man with a raised sword and riding a horse towards the foreground.|[[Religious]] sentiment often becomes a contributory factor of crime. In the 1819 anti-Jewish riots in Frankfurt, rioters attacked Jewish businesses and destroyed property.]]

Different religious traditions may promote distinct norms of behaviour, and these in turn may clash or harmonise with the perceived interests of a state. Socially accepted or imposed religious morality has influenced secular jurisdictions on issues that may otherwise concern only an individual's conscience. Activities sometimes criminalized on religious grounds include (for example) [[alcohol]] consumption ([[prohibition]]), [[abortion]] and [[stem cell|stem-cell]] research. In various historical and present-day societies, institutionalized religions have established systems of earthly justice that punish crimes against the divine will and against specific devotional, organizational and other rules under specific codes, such as Roman Catholic [[canon law]].

== Military jurisdictions and states of emergency ==

In the [[military]] sphere, authorities can prosecute both regular crimes and specific acts (such as [[mutiny]] or [[desertion]]) under [[martial law|martial-law]] codes that either supplant or extend civil codes in times of (for example) war.

Many constitutions contain provisions to curtail freedoms and criminalize otherwise tolerated behaviors under a [[state of emergency]] in the event of war, natural disaster or civil unrest. Undesired activities at such times may include [[Freedom of assembly|assembly]] in the streets, violation of [[curfew]], or [[Gun politics|possession of firearms]].

== Employee crime ==
{{Main article| Occupational crime}}

Two common types of [[employment|employee]] crime exist: [[embezzlement]] and [[wage theft]].

The complexity and anonymity of computer systems may help criminal employees camouflage their operations. The victims of the most costly [[confidence trick|scams]] include banks, brokerage houses, insurance companies, and other large financial institutions.&lt;ref name="Computing1"&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}

In [[physics]], a '''degree of freedom''' is an independent physical [[parameter]] in the formal description of the state of a [[physical system]]. The set of all states of a system is known as the system's [[phase space]], and degrees of freedom of the system, are the [[dimension]]s of the phase space.

==Definition==
A degree of freedom of a physical system is an independent parameter that is necessary to characterize the state of a physical system. In general, a degree of freedom may be any useful property that is not dependent on other variables.

The location of a particle in three-dimensional space requires three position coordinates. Similarly, the direction and speed at which a particle moves can be described in terms of three velocity components, each in reference to the three dimensions of space.  If the time evolution of the system is deterministic, where the state at one instant uniquely determines its past and future position and velocity as a function of time, such a system has six degrees of freedom.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} If the motion of the particle is constrained to a lower number of dimensions, for example, the particle must move along a wire or on a fixed surface, then the system has fewer than six degrees of freedom. On the other hand, a system with an extended object that can rotate or vibrate can have more than six degrees of freedom.

In [[classical mechanics]], the state of a [[point particle]] at any given time is often described with position and velocity coordinates in the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] formalism, or with position and momentum coordinates in the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] formalism.

In [[statistical mechanics]], a degree of freedom is a single [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] number describing the [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]] of a system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reif |first=F. |title=Fundamentals of Statistical and Thermal Physics |year=2009 |publisher=Waveland Press, Inc. |location=Long Grove, IL |isbn=1-57766-612-7 |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specification of all microstates of a system is a point in the system's [[phase space]].

In the 3D [[ideal chain]] model in chemistry, two [[angle]]s are necessary to describe the orientation of each monomer.

It is often useful to specify quadratic degrees of freedom. These are degrees of freedom that contribute in a quadratic function to the energy of the system.

==Gas molecules==
[[Image:Degrees of freedom (diatomic molecule).png|thumb|right|Different ways of visualizing the 6 degrees of freedom of a diatomic molecule. (CM: [[center of mass]] of the system, T: [[translational motion]], R: [[rotation]]al motion, V: [[molecular vibration|vibrational motion]].)]]

In three-dimensional space, three degrees of freedom are associated with the movement of a particle. A diatomic gas molecule has 6 degrees of freedom{{Dubious|reason=diatomic molecules have at most 6, usually 5|date=April 2017}}. This set may be decomposed in terms of translations, rotations, and [[molecular vibration|vibrations]] of the molecule. The [[center of mass]] motion of the entire molecule accounts for 3 degrees of freedom. In addition, the molecule has two [[rotation]]al degrees of motion and one{{Dubious|reason=diatomic molecules have at most 1, usually zero vibrational modes|date=April 2017}} [[vibrational mode]]. The rotations occur around the two axes perpendicular to the line between the two atoms. The rotation around the atom–atom bond is not a physical rotation{{Dubious|reason=Diatomic molecules rotate and precess|date=April 2017}}. This yields, for a diatomic molecule, a decomposition of:
:&lt;math&gt;N = 6 = 3 + 2 + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

For a general, non-linear molecule, all 3 rotational degrees of freedom are considered, resulting in the decomposition:
:&lt;math&gt;3N = 3 + 3 + (3N - 6)&lt;/math&gt;

which means that an {{mvar|N}}-atom molecule has {{math|3''N'' − 6}} vibrational degrees of freedom for {{math|''N'' &gt; 2}}. In special cases, such as adsorbed large molecules, the rotational degrees of freedom can be limited to only one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/cphc.201200531|pmid=23047526|title=Stabilization of Large Adsorbates by Rotational Entropy: A Time-Resolved Variable-Temperature STM Study|journal=ChemPhysChem|volume=14|issue=1|pages=162–9|year=2013|last1=Waldmann|first1=Thomas|last2=Klein|first2=Jens|last3=Hoster|first3=Harry E.|last4=Behm|first4=R. Jürgen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As defined above one can also count degrees of freedom using the minimum number of coordinates required to specify a position. This is done as follows:
# For a single particle we need 2 coordinates in a 2-D plane to specify its position and 3 coordinates in 3-D space. Thus its degree of freedom in a 3-D space is 3.
# For a body consisting of 2 particles (ex. a diatomic molecule) in a 3-D space with constant distance between them (let's say d) we can show (below) its degrees of freedom to be 5.
Let's say one particle in this body has coordinate {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and the other has coordinate {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} with {{math| ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} unknown. Application of the formula for distance between two coordinates
:&lt;math&gt;d=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
results in one equation with one unknown, in which we can solve for {{math|''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
One of {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, or {{math|''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be unknown.

Contrary to the classical [[equipartition theorem]], at room temperature, the vibrational motion of molecules typically makes negligible contributions to the [[heat capacity]]. This is because these degrees of freedom are ''frozen'' because the spacing between the energy [[eigenvalue]]s exceeds the energy corresponding to ambient [[temperature]]s ({{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''}}). In the following table such degrees of freedom are disregarded because of their low effect on total energy. Then only the translational and rotational degrees of freedom contribute, in equal amounts, to the [[heat capacity ratio]].  This is why {{mvar|γ}}={{math|{{sfrac|5|3}}}} for [[monatomic]] gases and {{mvar|γ}}={{math|{{sfrac|7|5}}}} for [[diatomic]] gases at room temperature.

However, at very high temperatures, on the order of the vibrational temperature (Θ&lt;sub&gt;vib&lt;/sub&gt;), vibrational motion cannot be neglected.

Vibrational temperatures are between 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; K and 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==Independent degrees of freedom==
The set of degrees of freedom {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of a system is independent if the energy associated with the set can be written in the following form:
:&lt;math&gt;E = \sum_{i=1}^N E_i(X_i),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a function of the sole variable {{mvar|X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

example: if {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are two degrees of freedom, and {{mvar|E}} is the associated energy:
:* If &lt;math&gt;E = X_1^4 + X_2^4&lt;/math&gt;, then the two degrees of freedom are independent.
:* If &lt;math&gt;E = X_1^4 + X_1 X_2 + X_2^4&lt;/math&gt;, then the two degrees of freedom are ''not'' independent. The term involving the product of {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a coupling term, that describes an interaction between the two degrees of freedom.

For {{mvar|i}} from 1 to {{mvar|N}}, the value of the {{mvar|i}}th degree of freedom {{mvar|X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is distributed according to the [[Boltzmann distribution]]. Its [[probability density function]] is the following:
: &lt;math&gt;p_i(X_i) = \frac{e^{-\frac{E_i}{k_B T}}}{\int dX_i \, e^{-\frac{E_i}{k_B T}}}&lt;/math&gt;,

In this section, and throughout the article the brackets &lt;math&gt;\langle \rangle&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[mean]] of the quantity they enclose.

The [[internal energy]] of the system is the sum of the average energies associated with each of the degrees of freedom:
:&lt;math&gt;\langle E \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^N \langle E_i \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

==Quadratic degrees of freedom==
A degree of freedom {{mvar|X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is quadratic if the energy terms associated with this degree of freedom can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;E = \alpha_i\,\,X_i^2 + \beta_i \,\, X_i Y &lt;/math&gt;,

where {{mvar|Y}} is a [[linear combination]] of other quadratic degrees of freedom.

example: if {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are two degrees of freedom, and {{mvar|E}} is the associated energy:
:* If &lt;math&gt;E = X_1^4 + X_1^3 X_2 + X_2^4&lt;/math&gt;, then the two degrees of freedom are not independent and non-quadratic.
:* If &lt;math&gt;E = X_1^4 + X_2^4&lt;/math&gt;, then the two degrees of freedom are independent and non-quadratic.
:* If &lt;math&gt;E = X_1^2 + X_1 X_2 + 2X_2^2&lt;/math&gt;, then the two degrees of freedom are not independent but are quadratic.
:* If &lt;math&gt;E = X_1^2 + 2X_2^2&lt;/math&gt;, then the two degrees of freedom are independent and quadratic.

For example, in [[Newtonian mechanics]], the [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of a system of quadratic degrees of freedom are controlled by a set of homogeneous [[linear differential equation]]s with [[constant coefficients]].

===Quadratic and independent degree of freedom===
{{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are quadratic and independent degrees of freedom if the energy associated with a microstate of the system they represent can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;E = \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i X_i^2&lt;/math&gt;

===Equipartition theorem===
In the classical limit of [[statistical mechanics]], at [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the [[internal energy]] of a system of {{mvar|N}} quadratic and independent degrees of freedom is:
: &lt;math&gt;U = \langle E \rangle = N\,\frac{k_B T}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the [[mean]] energy associated with a degree of freedom is:
:&lt;math&gt;\langle E_i \rangle = \int dX_i\,\,\alpha_i X_i^2\,\, p_i(X_i) = \frac{\int dX_i\,\,\alpha_i X_i^2\,\, e^{-\frac{\alpha_i X_i^2}{k_B T}}}{\int dX_i\,\, e^{-\frac{\alpha_i X_i^2}{k_B T}}} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\langle E_i \rangle = \frac{k_B T}{2}\frac{\int dx\,\,x^2\,\, e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}}{\int dx\,\, e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}} = \frac{k_B T}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

Since the degrees of freedom are independent, the [[internal energy]] of the system is equal to the sum of the [[mean]] energy associated with each degree of freedom, which demonstrates the result.

==Generalizations==
The description of a system's state as a [[point (geometry)|point]] in its phase space, although mathematically convenient, is thought to be fundamentally inaccurate. In [[quantum mechanics]], the motion degrees of freedom are superseded with the concept of [[wave function]], and [[operator (physics)|operators]] which correspond to other degrees of freedom have [[point spectrum|discrete spectra]]. For example, [[angular momentum operator#Spin, orbital, and total angular momentum|intrinsic angular momentum]] operator (which corresponds to the rotational freedom) for an [[electron]] or [[photon]] has only two [[eigenvalue]]s. This discreteness becomes apparent when [[action (physics)|action]] has an [[order of magnitude]] of the [[Planck constant]], and individual degrees of freedom can be distinguished.

'''Eduardo Kac''' [ɛdwardoʊ kæts; ĕd·wâr′·dō kăts] (1962) is an American contemporary [[artist]] and professor whose artworks that span a wide range of practices, including [[performance art]], poetry, [[holography]], [[interactive art]], telematic art and transgenic art. He is particularly well known for his works that integrate [[biotechnology]], politics and aesthetics. 

Kac began his art career in the early 1980s as performance artist in [[Rio De Janeiro, Brazil]]. Within a few years he was involved in exploring holography as an interactive art form. At the same time, he began creating animated poetic works on the French Minitel platform.  

Before moving from Brazil to the United States in the late 1980s, Kac began creating his first telematic artworks that used electronic technologies to bridge two or more physical locations. During the 1990s he continued to produce these works, at the same time as he coined the phrase ''bioart''. In addition to ''bioart'' Kac coined numerous neologisms to describe his transdisciplinary art practice, including ''holoart'', ''transgenic art'' (the integration of human genes in an artwork) and ''plantimal'', referring to a plant infused with human genes.&lt;ref name="artnexus"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kalenberg|first=Ángel|title=Eduardo Kac: The Artist as Demiurge|url=http://www.artnexus.com/Notice_View.aspx?DocumentID=19376}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Kac is perhaps best known for his transgenic artworks that use biotechnology to intervene on the natural genetic structure of plants and animals. His works ''Time Capsule'', ''GFP Bunny'' and ''Natural History of the Enigma'' in particular are recognized as notable works for having joined biotechnology, art and bioethics together into politically charged artworks. 

In 2017 Kac collaborated with the French Space Observatory office to have a sculpture made aboard the [[international space station]]. 

A multidisciplinary artist, Kac has also employed poetry, fax, photocopying, photography, video, fractals, poetry, RFID implants, virtual reality, networks, robotics, satellites, telerobotics, Morse code and DNA extraction in his practice.&lt;ref name="artnexus"/&gt; 


==Life==
Kac was born July 3, 1962 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.&lt;ref name="Brittanica"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eduardo-Kac|title=Eduardo Kac - Brazilian American artist|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kostelanetz2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Kostelanetz|title=A Dictionary of the Avant-Gardes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tsq6NDST_b0C&amp;pg=RA2-PT245|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-136-80620-2|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the School of Communications of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, receiving a BA degree in 1985,&lt;ref name="Brittanica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.duke.edu/art/newsbyte/2011/1014.html|title=NewsByte - Duke Art, Art History and Visual Studies|website=web.duke.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] where he received an MFA degree in 1990.&lt;ref name="Brittanica"/&gt; In 2003 he received a doctorate from the [[University of Wales]], Great Britain.&lt;ref name="SAICBio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saic.edu/profiles/faculty/edward-kac|title=ekac|website=School of the Art Institute of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kac is a professor of art at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="SAICBio"/&gt;

(1987), a moebius-like work that could be read in two directions.&lt;ref name="Funkhouser2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Thompson Funkhouser|title=Prehistoric Digital Poetry: An Archaeology of Forms, 1959-1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zqFAAAAIAAJ|date=24 June 2007|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=978-0-8173-1562-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

Around the same time, and drawing on his interest in experimental poetry forms, Kac began making animated poetry works with the French [[Minitel]] videtext terminals that were then in use in Rio.&lt;ref name="Kac2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eduardo Kac|title=Media Poetry: An International Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8OrAMstlEQC&amp;pg=PA276|year=2007|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=978-1-84150-030-0|pages=276–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 he contributed one such work, ''Reabracadabra'', to the ''Arte On Line'' exhibition, organized by the Livraria Nobel bookstore in Sao Paolo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://anthology.rhizome.org/reabracadabra|title=NET ART ANTHOLOGY: Reabracadabra|date=27 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rhizome.org/editorial/2016/nov/03/when-net-art-outlives-the-net-eduardo-kacs-poetry-for-videotexto/|title=When Net Art Outlives the Net: Eduardo Kac's Poetry for Videotexto|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://editorial.centroculturadigital.mx/notacorta/reabracadabra-de-eduardo-kac-en-la-net-art-anthology|title=Reabracadabra de Eduardo Kac, en la Net Art Anthology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other videotext animated poems by Kac include ''Recaos'' (1986), ''Tesão'' (1985/86) and ''D/eu/s'' (1986).&lt;ref name="Chandler2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Annmarie Chandler|title=At a Distance: Precursors to Art and Activism on the Internet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ri36wNZoqVkC&amp;pg=PT290|year=2005|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-03328-2|pages=290–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ledesma2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eduardo Ledesma|title=Radical Poetry: Aesthetics, Politics, Technology, and the Ibero-American Avant-Gardes, 1900-2015|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KfVsDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA270|date=2 November 2016|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-6202-8|pages=270–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, with Flavio Ferraz, Kac organized the ''Brasil High-Tech'' exhibition at the Galeria de Arte Centro Empresarial Rio in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/reabracadabry/|title=Media Art Net - Kac, Eduardo: Reabracadabra|first=Media Art|last=Net|date=14 August 2018|website=www.medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cronologia das artes plásticas no Rio de Janeiro: da missão artística francesa à geração 90 : 1816, mil oitocentos e dezesseis a mil novecentos e noventa e quatro, 1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=deFeAAAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Topbooks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1985 to as late as 1994, Kac did a number of telecommunications performances that used [[Slow-scan television]] (SSTV)  and [[FAX]] technologies to create performances between separate locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1678-53202003000100003&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=pt|title=A arte de comunicação telemática: a interatividade no ciberespaço|first=Walter|last=Zanini|publisher=|journal=ARS (São Paulo)|volume=1|issue=1|pages=11–34|via=SciELO|doi=10.1590/S1678-53202003000100003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leonardo.info/isast/spec.projects/fadon/fadon.html|title=Evanescent Realities|website=www.leonardo.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late 80s Kac began work on his ''Ornitorrinco'' project, a telepresence artwork made in collaboration with Ed Bennett in Chicago. The work brought together robotics, telecommunications technologies and interactivity to create a robot that was controlled remotely. The piece allowed viewers in one location to control the robot's camera and motion, creating a telepresent work and effecting the experience of viewers in the other location.&lt;ref name="Giannachi2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gabriella Giannachi|title=Virtual Theatres: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0wXWQ5hwtsC&amp;pg=PA82|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-28379-3|pages=82–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kobialka1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michal Kobialka|title=Of Borders and Thresholds: Theatre History, Practice, and Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MSrzO77VBEwC&amp;pg=PA282|year=1999|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-3090-5|pages=282–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Kac moved from Brazil to Chicago, where he would complete his MFA at the Art Institute of Chicago the following year.&lt;ref name="Kostelanetz2013" /&gt;

=== 1990s ===
In the 1990s, Kac continued creating telematic works, with ''Dialogical Drawing'' (1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Art: The Magazine of Contemporary Visual Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UlRUAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=G+B Arts International}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1994) both using networks to explore the viewer experience of an artwork mediated between two site in real time. In the latter case, the artwork joined a plant in New York city and a live canary in Kentucky in conversation.&lt;ref name="Wilson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Wilson|title=Information Arts: Intersections of Art, Science, and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sHuXQtYrNPYC&amp;pg=PT145|year=2002|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-73158-4|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of a bird as part of its system, making it an early example of what Kac called ''transgenic art''.&lt;ref name="Bolognini2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maurizio Bolognini|title=Machines: Conversations on Art &amp; Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dnE2PjwVFkgC&amp;pg=PA89|year=2012|publisher=postmediabooks|isbn=978-88-7490-074-9|pages=89–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Teleporting An Unknown State'' (1994-96), Kac built a system that allowed a plant to survive in a gallery, illuminated not by sunlight but by the internet viewers of the work. In practice, online viewers of the work triggered a video projection onto the plant of an image representing the sky in the viewer's home location.&lt;ref name="Morey2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sean Morey|title=Rhetorical Delivery and Digital Technologies: Networks, Affect, Electracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uoj4CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT267|date=19 November 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-40708-9|pages=267–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MachinerySIGGRAPH.1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Association for Computing Machinery|author2=SIGGRAPH.|title=Visual proceedings: the art and interdisciplinary programs of SIGGRAPH 96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=omc-AQAAIAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Association for Computing Machinery|isbn=978-0-89791-784-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Flash Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3tUAAAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=G. Politi}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Notably, Kac coined the term "bioart" with his 1997 performance work ''Time Capsule''.&lt;ref name="Lushetich2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Natasha Lushetich|title=Interdisciplinary Performance: Reformatting Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdv_CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA242|date=13 April 2016|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|isbn=978-1-137-33503-6|pages=242–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Banash2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Banash|title=Steve Tomasula: The Art and Science of New Media Fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lj24CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|date=21 May 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-62892-369-8|pages=8–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Time Capsule'', Kac implanted himself with an [[RFID]] chip originally designed for use in pets. A participant in Chicago then triggered the RFID scanned in the Brazilian Gallery where Kac was performing, casing the scanner to display a unique code for the implant. Kac then registered himself on the pet database associated with the implant, becoming the first human to do so.&lt;ref name="Weintraub2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Scott Weintraub|title=Latin American Technopoetics: Scientific Explorations in New Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOhgDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91|date=17 July 2018|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-429-83939-9|pages=91–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Will Jackson|title=Crisis, Rupture and Anxiety: An Interdisciplinary Examination of Contemporary and Historical Human Challenges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zQsBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA135|date=1 March 2012|publisher=Cambridge Scholars|isbn=978-1-4438-3616-6|pages=135–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Artbyte|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LVkgAQAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=ArtByte, Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the late 90s Kac defined himself either a "transgenic artist" or "bio artist,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/07/bioart/|title=Bioart: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Using Living Tissue as a Medium|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was using [[biotechnology]] and [[genetics]] to create provocative works that concomitantly explore [[scientific technique]]s and critique them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.minnpost.com/arts-arena/2009/04/art-world-today-will-meet-edunia-eduardo-kacs-genetically-engineered-plantimal|title=Art world today will meet 'Edunia,' Eduardo Kac's genetically engineered 'plantimal'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kac's next transgenic artwork, created in 1998/99 and titled "Genesis," involved him taking a quote from the [[Bible]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis 1:26]] - "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth"), transferring it into [[Morse code]], and finally, translating that Morse code (by a conversion principle specially developed by the artist for this work) into the base pairs of genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=278|title=Eduardo Kac : Genesis 2|website=www.fondation-langlois.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bureaud2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Annick Bureaud|title=Eduardo Kac: Telepresence, Biotelematics, Transgenic Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQjlAAAAMAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Association for Culture and Education, KIBLA Multimedia Center|isbn=978-961-6304-02-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
In one of his best known works, ''[[Alba (rabbit)|Alba]]'', presented in 2000 in Avignon, France, Kac claimed to have commissioned a French laboratory to create a green-fluorescent [[rabbit]]; a rabbit implanted with a [[Green Fluorescent Protein]] (GFP) [[gene]] from a type of [[jellyfish]].&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2001/04/bunny/|title=I Love My Glow Bunny|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HopeRyan2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cat Hope|author2=John Charles Ryan|title=Digital Arts: An Introduction to New Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SO6KAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT171|date=19 June 2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-78093-321-4|pages=171–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under a specific blue light, the rabbit fluoresces green. The work proved to be hugely controversial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=119939&amp;page=1|title=Artist's Glowing, Live Rabbit Creation Causes Fuss|first=A. B.

His work ''Natural History of the Enigma'' (2003-8) continued in the theme of bio art by merging his DNA with that of a [[petunia]], creating a hybrid organism that Kac called a ''plantimal''.&lt;ref name="DunneRaby2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Dunne|author2=Fiona Raby|title=Speculative Everything: Design, Fiction, and Social Dreaming|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQyAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54|date=6 December 2013|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-01984-2|pages=54–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-story-of-how-an-artist-created-a-genetic-hybrid-of-himself-and-a-petunia-25148544/|title=The Story of How An Artist Created a Genetic Hybrid of Himself and a Petunia|first=Megan|last=Gambino|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant, also given the name ''Eudinia'' (from Eduardo and Petunia), mimicked the flow of blood through human veins by mixing Kac's DNA only with the plant's genetic components that made the veins in its leaves red.&lt;ref name="DunneRaby2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grau2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oliver Grau|title=Imagery in the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fdHxCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71|date=29 July 2011|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-29742-4|pages=71–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
In 2017 Kac collaborated with the French astronaut [[Thomas Pesquet]] to create an artwork in space called ''Inner Telescope''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/2016/11/17/03004-20161117ARTFIG00228-un-grand-pas-pour-l-art.php|title=Un grand pas pour l'art|date=17 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Kac's instructions, Pesquet cut and folded a piece of paper into a sculptural form that could be read as the three letters forming the French word for ''me'', M-O-I.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/arts/design/eduardo-kac-inner-telescope-space.html|title=A Space Odyssey: Making Art Up There|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2017/04/12/art-space-sparks-discussion-technology-ai|title=Art in Space Sparks Discussion on Technology, AI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Governance}}

'''Environmental governance''' is a concept in [[political ecology]] and [[environmental policy]] that advocates [[sustainability]] ([[sustainable development]]) as the supreme consideration for [[Management|managing]] all human activities—[[Politics|political]], [[social]] and [[Economy|economic]].&lt;ref&gt;Page 8. The Soft Path in a Nutshell. (2005). Oliver M Brandes and David B Brooks. University of Victoria, Victoria, BC.&lt;/ref&gt; Governance includes government, business and civil society, and emphasizes whole [[Systems management|system management]]. To capture this diverse range of elements, environmental governance often employs alternative systems of governance, for example watershed-based management.&lt;ref&gt;IPlanet U, R. Michael M'Gonigle, Justine Starke&lt;/ref&gt;

It views [[natural resource]]s and the environment as global [[public goods]], belonging to the category of [[goods]] that are not diminished when they are shared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institut-gouvernance.org/en/analyse/fiche-analyse-317.html Launay, Claire, Mouriès, Thomas, '' Les différentes catégories de biens '', summary and excerpt from Pierre Calame’s book, ’’La démocratie en miettes’’, 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that everyone benefits from for example, a breathable [[atmosphere]], stable [[climate]] and stable [[biodiversity]].

Public goods are non-rivalrous—a natural resource enjoyed by one person can still be enjoyed by others—and non-excludable—it is impossible to prevent someone consuming the good (breathing). Nevertheless, public goods are recognized as beneficial and therefore have value. The notion of a global public good thus emerges, with a slight distinction: it covers necessities that must not be destroyed by one person or state.

The non-rivalrous character of such goods calls for a management approach that restricts public and private actors from damaging them. One approach is to attribute an [[economic value]] to the resource. [[Water]] is possibly the best example of this type of good.

As of 2013 environmental governance is far from meeting these imperatives. “Despite a great awareness of environmental questions from [[Developed country|developed]] and [[Developing country|developing countries]], there is [[environmental degradation]] and the appearance of new environmental problems. This situation is caused by the parlous state of global environmental governance, wherein current global environmental governance is unable to address environmental issues due to many factors. These include fragmented governance within the [[United Nations]], lack of involvement from financial institutions, proliferation of environmental agreements often in conflict with [[trade]] measures; all these various problems disturb the proper functioning of global environmental governance. Moreover, divisions among northern countries and the persistent gap between developed and developing countries also have to be taken into account to comprehend the institutional failures of the current global environmental governance."

==Definitions==
'''What is Environmental Governance?'''

Environmental governance refers to the processes of [[decision-making]] involved in the control and management of the environment and [[natural resource]]s. [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), define environmental governance as the 'multi-level interactions (i.e., local, national, international/global) among, but not limited to, three main actors, i.e., state, [[market (economics)|market]], and civil society, which interact with one another, whether in formal and informal ways; in formulating and implementing policies in response to environment-related demands and inputs from the society; bound by rules, procedures, processes, and widely accepted behavior; possessing characteristics of “good governance”; for the purpose of attaining environmentally-[[sustainable development]]' (IUCN 2014)

Key principles of environmental governance include:

* Embedding the environment in all levels of decision-making and action
* Conceptualizing cities and communities, economic and political life as a subset of the environment
* Emphasizing the connection of people to the ecosystems in which they live
* Promoting the transition from open-loop/cradle-to-grave systems (like garbage disposal with no recycling) to closed-loop/[[cradle-to-cradle]] systems (like [[permaculture]] and [[zero waste]] strategies).

'''Neoliberal Environmental Governance''' – is an approach to the theory of environmental governance framed by a perspective on [[neoliberalism]] as an ideology, policy and practice in relation to the biophysical world. There are many definitions and applications of neoliberalism, e.g. in economic, international relations, etc. However, the traditional understanding of neoliberalism is often simplified to the notion of the primacy of market-led economics through the rolling back of the state, [[deregulation]] and [[privatisation]]. Neoliberalism has evolved particularly over the last 40 years with many scholars leaving their ideological footprint on the neoliberal map. [[Hayek]] and [[Friedman]] believed in the superiority of the free market over state intervention. As long as the market was allowed to act freely, the supply/demand law would ensure the ‘optimal’ price and reward. In [[Karl Polanyi]]’s opposing view this would also create a state of tension in which self-regulating [[free market]]s disrupt and alter social interactions and “displace other valued means of living and working”.&lt;ref&gt;Castree, N. (2007) ‘Neoliberal ecologies’, in Nik Heynen, James McCarthy, Scott Prudham and Paul Robbins (eds.) Neoliberal environments, London: Routledge, p.  281.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in contrast to the notion of an unregulated market economy there has also been a “paradoxical increase in [state] intervention”&lt;ref&gt;Jessop B. (2002) ‘Liberalism, Neo-Liberalism and Urban Governance: A State Theoretical Perspective’, Antipode, 34 (3), p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt; in the choice of economic, legislative and social policy reforms, which are pursued by the state to preserve the neoliberal order. This contradictory process is described by Peck and Tickell as roll back/roll out neoliberalism in which on one hand the state willingly gives up the control over resources and responsibility for social provision while on the other, it engages in “purposeful construction and consolidation of neoliberalised state forms, modes of governance, and regulatory relations".&lt;ref&gt;Peck, J. and Tickell, A. (2002) ‘Neoliberalising Space’, Antipode, 34(3): p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a growing interest in the effects of neoliberalism on the politics of the non-human world of environmental governance. Neoliberalism is seen to be more than a homogenous and monolithic ‘thing’ with a clear end point.&lt;ref&gt;Heynen N and Robins P. (2005) ‘The neoliberalisation of nature: Governance, privatization, enclosure and valuation’, Capitalism Nature Socialism, 16(1): p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a series of path-dependent, spatially and temporally “connected neoliberalisation” processes which affect and are affected by nature and environment that “cover a remarkable array of places, regions and countries”.&lt;ref&gt;Castree, N. (2007) ‘Neoliberal ecologies’, in Nik Heynen, James McCarthy, Scott Prudham and Paul Robbins (eds.) Neoliberal environments, London: Routledge, p.  283.&lt;/ref&gt;  Co-opting neoliberal ideas of the importance of private property and the protection of individual (investor) rights, into environmental governance can be seen in the example of recent multilateral trade agreements (see in particular the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]). Such neoliberal structures further reinforce a process of nature enclosure and primitive accumulation or “accumulation by dispossession” that serves to privatise increasing areas of nature.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, J. (2004) ‘Privatizing conditions of production: trade agreements as neoliberal environmental governance’, Geoforum, 35(3), p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; The ownership-transfer of resources traditionally not privately owned to free market mechanisms is believed to deliver greater efficiency and optimal return on investment.&lt;ref&gt;Swyngedouw, E. (2005) ‘Dispossessing H20: The contested terrain of water privatisation’, Capitalism, Nature, Socialism, 16(1): pp. 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar examples of neo-liberal inspired projects include the enclosure of minerals, the fisheries quota system in the North Pacific&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield, B. (2004) ‘Rules of Privatization: Contradictions in Neoliberal Regulation of North Pacific Fisheries’ Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 94(3): pp. 565–584.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[water privatization|privatisation of water supply]] and [[sewage treatment]] in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, K. (2004) An uncooperative commodity: privatizing water in England and Wales, Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; All three examples share neoliberal characteristics to “deploy markets as the solution to environmental problems” in which scarce natural resources are commercialized and turned into commodities.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, K. (2004) An uncooperative commodity: privatizing water in England and Wales, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.431&lt;/ref&gt; The approach to frame the ecosystem in the context of a price-able commodity is also present in the work of neoliberal geographers who subject nature to price and supply/demand mechanisms where the earth is considered to be a [[quantifiable]] resource ([[Robert Costanza|Costanza]], for example, estimates the earth [[ecosystem services|ecosystem's service]] value to be between 16 and [[orders of magnitude (currency)#1 trillion to 100 trillion|54 trillion dollars]] per year&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. et al., (1997) ‘The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital’, Nature 387(6630): pp. 255&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Environmental issues==

===Main drivers of environmental degradation===

''[[Economic growth]]'' – The development-centric vision that prevails in most countries and international institutions advocates a headlong rush towards more economic growth. Environmental economists on the other hand, point to a close correlation between economic growth and [[environmental degradation]], arguing for qualitative development as an alternative to growth. As a result, the past couple of decades has seen a big shift towards sustainable development as an alternative to neo-liberal economics. There are those, particularly within the alternative globalization movement, who maintain that it is feasible to change to a [[degrowth]] phase without losing social efficiency or lowering the [[quality of life]].

''[[Consumption (economics)|Consumption]]'' – The growth of consumption and the cult of consumption, or [[consumerist]] ideology, is the major cause of economic growth. Overdevelopment, seen as the only alternative to poverty, has become an end in itself. The means for curbing this growth are not equal to the task, since the phenomenon is not confined to a growing middle class in developing countries, but also concerns the development of irresponsible lifestyles, particularly in northern countries, such as the increase in the size and number of homes and cars per person.

''Destruction of [[biodiversity]]'' – The complexity of the planet’s ecosystems means that the loss of any species has unexpected consequences. The stronger the impact on biodiversity, the stronger the likelihood of a chain reaction with unpredictable negative effects. Another important factor of environmental degradation that falls under this destruction of biodiversity, and must not be ignored is [[deforestation]]. Despite all the damage inflicted, a number of ecosystems have proved to be [[Resilience (ecology)|resilient]]. Environmentalists are endorsing a precautionary principle whereby all potentially damaging activities would have to be analyzed for their [[environmental impact]].

''[[Population growth]]'' – Forecasts predict 8.9 billion people on the planet in 2050. This is a subject which primarily affects developing countries, but also concerns northern countries; although their demographic growth is lower, the environmental impact per person is far higher in these countries. Demographic growth needs to be countered by developing education and family planning programs and generally improving women’s status.

"[[Pollution]]" - Pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels is another driver of environmental destruction. The burning of carbon-based fossil fuels such as coal and oil, releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. One of the major impacts of this is the climate change that is currently taking place on the planet, where the earth's temperature is gradually rising. Given that fuels such as coal and oil are the most heavily used fuels, this a great concern to many environmentalists.

"Agricultural practices" - Destructive agricultural practices such as overuse of fertilizers and [[overgrazing]] lead to land degradation. The soil gets [[soil erosion|eroded]], and leads to silting in rivers and reservoirs. Soil erosion is a continuous cycle and ultimately results in [[desertification]] of the land. Apart from [[land degradation]], [[water pollution]] is also a possibility; chemicals used in farming can [[surface runoff|run-off]] into rivers and [[water contamination|contaminate the water]].

===Challenges===

The crisis by the impact of human activities on nature calls for governance. Which includes responses by international institutions, governments and citizens, who should meet this crisis by pooling the experience and knowledge of each of the agents and institutions concerned.

The [[environmental protection]] measures taken remain insufficient. The necessary reforms require time, energy, money and diplomatic negotiations. The situation has not generated a unanimous response. Persistent divisions slow progress towards global environmental governance.

The global nature of the crisis limits the effects of national or sectoral measures. Cooperation is necessary between actors and institutions in international trade, sustainable development and [[peace]].

Global, continental, national and local governments have employed a variety of approaches to environmental governance. Substantial positive and negative spillovers limit the ability of any single jurisdiction to resolve issues.

Challenges facing environmental governance include:

* Inadequate continental and global agreements
* Unresolved tensions between maximum development, sustainable development and maximum protection, limiting funding, damaging links with the economy and limiting application of [[Multilateral Environment Agreement]]s (MEAs).
* Environmental funding is not self-sustaining, diverting resources from problem-solving into funding battles.
* Lack of integration of sector policies
* Inadequate institutional capacities
* Ill-defined priorities
* Unclear objectives
* Lack of coordination within the UN, governments, the private sector and civil society
* Lack of shared vision
* Interdependencies among development/sustainable economic growth, trade, agriculture, health, peace and security.
* International imbalance between environmental governance and trade and finance programs, e.g., [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).
* Limited credit for organizations running projects within the Global Environment Facility (GEF)
* Linking [[UNEP]], [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) and the [[World Bank]] with MEAs
* Lack of government capacity to satisfy MEA obligations
* Absence of the gender perspective and equity in environmental governance
* Inability to influence public opinion&lt;ref name="inforesources2005"&gt;[http://www.inforesources.ch/pdf/focus_3_05_e.pdf Global Conventions and Environmental Governance; Inforesources Focus No. 3, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unep&gt;UNEP; International Environmental Governance and the Reform of the United Nations, XVI Meeting of the Forum of Environment Ministers of Latin America and the Caribbean;  2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/civil_society/PDF_docs/3rdGCSF_CS_Statement_IEG.pdf Civil Society Statement on International Environmental Governance; Seventh special session of the UNEP Governing Council/GMEF; Cartagena, Colombia; February 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Time lag between human action and environmental effect, sometimes as long as a generation&lt;ref name="Underdal, A 2010, pp.386-393"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Underdal | first1 = A | year = 2010 | title = Complexity and challenges of long term environmental governance | url = | journal = Global environmental change | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 386–393 | doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Environmental problems being embedded in very complex systems, of which our understanding is still quite weak&lt;ref name="Underdal, A 2010, pp.386-393"/&gt;

All of these challenges have implications on governance, however international environmental governance is necessary. The IDDRI claims that rejection of [[multilateralism]] in the name of efficiency and protection of national interests conflicts with the promotion of international law and the concept of global public goods. Others cite the complex nature of environmental problems.

On the other hand, The [[local Agenda 21|Agenda 21]] program has been implemented in over 7,000 communities.&lt;ref&gt;7,000 municipalities is very few, in view of the fact that over a million municipalities exist on the planet and that initial forecasts were for local agenda 21 actions being adopted in 500,000 municipalities in 1996 and throughout the rest of the planet in 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental problems, including global-scale problems, may not always require global solutions. For example, marine pollution can be tackled regionally, and ecosystem deterioration can be addressed locally. Other global problems such as climate change benefit from local and regional action.

Bäckstrand and Saward wrote, “sustainability and environmental protection is an arena in which innovative experiments with new hybrid, plurilateral forms of governance, along with the incorporation of a transnational civil society spanning the public-private divide, are taking place.”&lt;ref name=Saward&gt;[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p58974_index.html Bäckstrand, Karin; Saward, Michel; Democratizing Global Governance: Stakeholder Democracy at the World Summit for Sustainable Development; Document presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association; Chicago; 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local governance===
A 1997 report observed a global consensus that sustainable development implementation should be based on local level solutions and initiatives designed with and by the local communities.&lt;ref name="Leach, M. 1997 pp 1"&gt;Leach, M., Mearns, R and Scoones, I. (1997), Challenges to community based sustainable development, in IDS Bulletin Vol 28:4, pp 1&lt;/ref&gt; Community participation and partnership along with the decentralisation of government power to local communities are important aspects of environmental governance at the local level. Initiatives such as these are integral divergence from earlier environmental governance approaches which was “driven by state agendas and resource control”&lt;ref name="Leach, M. 1997 pp 1"/&gt; and followed a top-down or trickle down approach rather than the bottom up approach that local level governance encompasses. The adoption of practices or interventions at a local scale can, in part, be explained by [[Diffusion of innovations|diffusion of innovation]] theory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mascia|first=Michael B.|last2=Mills|first2=Morena|title=When conservation goes viral: The diffusion of innovative biodiversity conservation policies and practices|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12442/abstract|journal=Conservation Letters|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/conl.12442|issn=1755-263X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania and in the Pacific, researchers have illustrated that aspects of the intervention, of the adopter, and of the social-ecological context all shape why community-centered conservation interventions spread through space and time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Local level governance shifts decision making power away from the state and/or governments to the grassroots. Local level governance is extremely important even on a global scale. Environmental governance at the global level is defined as international and as such has resulted in the marginalisation of local voices. Local level governance is important to bring back power to local communities in the global fight against environmental degridation.&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 57"&gt;Elliot, L. (1956), Global Environmental Governance, in Hughes, S. and Wilkinson, R. (eds), Global Governance: Critical Perspectives, London: Routledge, ch. 4, pp. 57&lt;/ref&gt;  Pulgar Vidal observed a “new institutional framework, [wherein] decision-making regarding access to and use of natural resources has become increasingly decentralized.”&lt;ref name=pv&gt;[http://www.idrc.ca/uploads/user-S/11304196171GAD-espanol.pdf Pulgar Vidal, Manuel; Gobernanza Ambiental Descentralizada (Decentralized Environmental Governance); 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; He noted four techniques that can be used to develop these processes:

* formal and informal regulations, procedures and processes, such as consultations and participative democracy;
* social interaction that can arise from participation in development programs or from the reaction to perceived injustice;
* regulating social behaviours to reclassify an individual question as a [[public matter]];
* within-group [[participation (decision making)|participation]] in decision-making and relations with external actors.

He found that the key conditions for developing decentralized environmental governance are:

* access to [[social capital]], including local knowledge, leaders and local shared vision;
* democratic access to information and decision-making;
* local government activity in environmental governance: as facilitator of access to natural resources, or as policy maker;
* an institutional framework that favours decentralized environmental governance and creates forums for social interaction and making widely accepted agreements acceptable.&lt;ref name=pv/&gt;

The legitimacy of decisions depends on the local population's participation rate and on how well participants represent that population.&lt;ref name=poats&gt;[http://www.portalces.org/content/view/85/100000022/lang,Spanish Suárez, David; Poats, Susan V.; Procesos de Gobernanza Ambiental en el Manejo Participativo de Áreas Protegidas en Carchi (Environmental Governance Processes in the Participative Management of Carchi Protected Areas); Symposium; 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;
With regard to public authorities, questions linked to biodiversity can be faced by adopting appropriate policies and strategies, through exchange of knowledge and experience, the forming of partnerships, correct management of land use, monitoring of biodiversity and optimal use of resources, or reducing consumption, and promoting environmental certifications, such as EMAS and/or ISO 14001. Local authorities undoubtedly have a central role to play in the protection of biodiversity and this strategy is successful above all when the authorities show strength by involving stakeholders in a credible environmental improvement project and activating a transparent and effective communication policy (Ioppolo et al., 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Ioppolo G., Saija G., Salomone R. 2013. From coastal management to environmental management: The sustainable eco-tourism program for the mid-western coast of Sardinia (Italy). Land Use Policy (31), 460-471&lt;/ref&gt;

===State governance===
States play a crucial role in environmental governance, because "however far and fast international economic integration proceeds, political authority remains vested in national governments".&lt;ref&gt;Cable, V. 1999, ''Globalisation and global governance'', Chatham House Papers, London&lt;/ref&gt; It is for this reason that governments should respect and support the commitment to implementation of international agreements.&lt;ref&gt;WHAT 2000, "Governance for a sustainable future", Reports of the Commissions of the World Humanity Action Trust, viewed 22 April 2014, http://www.stakeholderforum.org/policy/governance/future.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

At the state level, [[environmental management]] has been found to be conducive to the creation of roundtables and committees. In France, the ''Grenelle de l’environnement''&lt;ref&gt;Operational Committee No. 24 "Institutions and stakeholder representativity" (introduced by Bertrand Pancher); Final report to the Prime Minister, senior Minister, Minister for the Ecology, Sustainable Development and Territorial Planning; 2008, also known as the Rapport Pancher.&lt;/ref&gt; process:

* included a variety of actors (e.g. the state, political leaders, unions, businesses, not-for-profit organizations and environmental protection foundations);
* allowed stakeholders to interact with the legislative and executive powers in office as indispensable advisors;
* worked to integrate other institutions, particularly the [[French Economic, Social and Environmental Council|Economic and Social Council]], to form a pressure group that participated in the process for creating an environmental governance model;
* attempted to link with environmental management at regional and local levels.

If environmental issues are excluded from e.g., the economic agenda, this may delegitimize those institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eauxglacees.com/Gouvernance-environnementale-vers Laime, Marc; Gouvernance environnementale: vers une meilleure concertation ? (Environmental Governance: towards better consultation?); 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

“In southern countries, the main obstacle to the integration of intermediate levels in the process of territorial environmental governance development is often the dominance of developmentalist inertia in states’ political mindset. The question of the environment has not been effectively integrated in national development planning and programs. Instead, the most common idea is that environmental protection curbs economic and social development, an idea encouraged by the frenzy for exporting raw materials extracted using destructive methods that consume resources and fail to generate any added value.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucn.org/es/sobre/union/secretaria/oficinas/sudamerica/sur_trabajo/sur_pgam.cfm IUCN; Gobernanza ambiental para un desarrollo sostenible (Environmental Governance for Sustainable Development).]&lt;/ref&gt; Of course they are justified in this thinking, as their main concerns are social injustices such as poverty alleviation. Citizens in some of these states have responded by developing empowerment strategies to ease poverty through sustainable development. In addition to this, policymakers must be more aware of these concerns of the global south, and must make sure to integrate a strong focus on social justice in their policies.

=== Global Governance ===
At the global level there are numerous important actors involved in environmental governance and "a range of institutions contribute to and help define the practice of global environmental governance.&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 57"/&gt; The idea of global environmental governance is to govern the environment at a global level through a range of nation states and non state actors such as national governments, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and other international organisations such as UNEP ([[United Nations Environment Programme]]). Global environmental governance is the answer to calls for new forms of governance because of the increasing complexity of the international agenda. It is perceived to be an effective form of multilateral management and essential to the international community in meeting goals of mitigation and the possible reversal of the impacts on the global environment.&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"&gt;Elliot, L. (1956), Global Environmental Governance, in Hughes, S. and Wilkinson, R. (eds), Global Governance: Critical Perspectives, London: Routledge, ch. 4, pp. 58&lt;/ref&gt; However, a precise definition of global environmental governance is still vague and there are many issues surrounding global governance.&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"/&gt;
Elliot argues that “the congested institutional terrain still provides more of an appearance than a reality of comprehensive global governance.”&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"/&gt;  This meant that there are too many institutions within the global governance of the environment for it to be completely inclusive and coherent leaving it merely portraying the image of this to the global public. Global environmental governance is about more than simply expanding networks of institutions and decision makers. “It is a political practice which simultaneously reflects, constitutes and masks global relations of power and powerlessness.”&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"/&gt; State agendas exploit the use of global environmental governance to enhance their oven agendas or wishes even if this is at the detriment of the vital element behind global environmental governance which is the environment. Elliot states that global environmental governance “is neither normatively neutral nor materially benign.”&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"/&gt;
As explored by Newell, report notes by The Global Environmental Outlook noted that the systems of global environmental governance are becoming increasingly irrelevant or impotent due to patterns of globalisation such as; imbalances in productivity and the distribution of goods and services, unsustainable progression of extremes of wealth and poverty and population and economic growth overtaking environmental gains.&lt;ref name="Newell, P. 2008 pp 508"&gt;Newell, P.(2008). The political economy of global environmental governance. Review of International Studies, 34, pp 508&lt;/ref&gt; Newell states that, despite such acknowledgements, the “managing of global environmental change within International Relations continues to look to international regimes for the answers.”&lt;ref name="Newell, P. 2008 pp 508"/&gt;

=== Issues of scale ===

==== Multi-tier governance ====

The literature on governance scale shows how changes in the understanding of [[environmental issues]] have led to the movement from a local view to recognising their larger and more complicated scale. This move brought an increase in the diversity, specificity and complexity of initiatives. Meadowcroft pointed out innovations that were layered on top of existing structures and processes, instead of replacing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meadowcroft|first=James|title=Politics and scale: some implications for environmental governance|journal=Landscape and urban planning|year=2002|volume=61|issue=2–4|pages=169–179|doi=10.1016/s0169-2046(02)00111-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lafferty and Meadowcroft give three examples of multi-tiered governance: [[internationalisation]], increasingly comprehensive approaches, and involvement of multiple governmental entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lafferty|first=William|title=Implementing Sustainable Development|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|author2=Meadowcroft, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lafferty and Meadowcroft described the resulting multi-tiered system as addressing issues on both smaller and wider scales.

==== Institutional fit ====

[[Hans Bruyninckx]] claimed that a mismatch between the scale of the environmental problem and the level of the policy intervention was problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruyninckx|first=Hans|title=Environmental evaluation practices and the issue of scale|journal=New directions for evaluation|year=2009|volume=122|pages=31–39|doi=10.1002/ev.293|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/234737/1/newdirectionsevaluation-HB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Young claimed that such mismatches reduced the effectiveness of interventions.&lt;ref name=young&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Oran|title=The globalization of socio-ecological systems: An agenda for scientific research|journal=Global Environmental Change|year=2006|volume=16|issue=3|pages=304–316|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the literature addresses the level of [[governance]] rather than ecological scale.

[[Elinor Ostrom]], amongst others, claimed that the mismatch is often the cause of unsustainable management practices and that simple solutions to the mismatch have not been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Folke|first=C|title=The problem of fit between ecosystems and institutions: ten years later|journal=Ecology and Society|year=2007|volume=12|issue=1|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrem|first=Elinor|title=A diagnostic approach for going beyond panaceas|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2007|volume=104|issue=39|pages=15181–15187|doi=10.1073/pnas.0702288104|bibcode=2007PNAS..10415181O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable debate has addressed the question of which level(s) should take responsibility for fresh water management. Development workers tend to address the problem at the local level. National governments focus on policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lebel|first=L |author2=Garden, L |author3=Imamura, M|title=The Politics of Scale, Position and Place in the Governance of Water Resources in the Mekong Region|journal=Ecology and Society|year=2005|volume=10|issue=2|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can create conflicts among states because rivers cross borders, leading to efforts to evolve governance of  [[river basins]].&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 57"/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zagg|first=V|author2=Gupta, J|title=Scale issues in the governance of water storage projects|journal=Water Resources Research|year=2008|volume=44|issue=10|pages=W10417|bibcode=2008WRR....4410417V|doi=10.1029/2007WR006364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental governance issues==

===Soil deterioration===

[[soil degradation|Soil]] and [[land degradation|land deterioration]] reduces its [[field capacity|capacity]] for capturing, [[water storage|storing]] and recycling water, energy and food. [[Alliance 21]] proposed solutions in the following domains:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article514.html Alliance 21’s Proposal Paper “Save our Soils to Sustain our Societies”]&lt;/ref&gt;

* include [[Soil regeneration|soil rehabilitation]] as part of conventional and popular education
* involve all stakeholders, including policymakers and authorities, producers and land users, the scientific community and civil society to manage incentives and enforce regulations and laws
* establish a set of binding rules, such as an international convention
* set up mechanisms and incentives to facilitate transformations
* gather and share knowledge;
* mobilize funds nationally and internationally

===Climate change===
The scientific consensus on [[climate change]] is expressed in the reports of [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) and also in the statements by all major scientific bodies in the United States such as [[National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Oreskes, N 2004, "Beyond the ivory tower", Science, vol. 306, no. 5702, pp, 1686.&lt;/ref&gt;

The drivers of climate change can include
- Changes in [[solar irradiance]]
- Changes in atmospheric [[trace gas]] and [[aerosol]] concentrations
Evidence of climate change can be identified by examining
- Atmospheric concentrations of [[Green House Gas]]es (GHGs) such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO2)
- Land and sea surface temperatures
- Atmospheric water vapor
- [[Precipitation]]
- The occurrence or strength of extreme weather and climate events
- [[Glacier]]s
- Rapid sea [[ice loss]]
- Sea level&lt;ref&gt;http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_Chapter01_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It is suggested by climate models that the changes in temperature and sea level can be the causal effects of human activities such as [[fuel consumption|consumption]] of fossil fuels, [[deforestation]], increased [[agricultural production]] and production of [[xenobiotic]] gases.&lt;ref&gt;Pernetta, JC &amp; Elder, DL 1992 Climate, Sealevel rise and the coastal zone: management and planning of global changes, Ocean and coastal management, vol 18, pp- 113-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been increasing actions in order to mitigate climate change and reduce its impact at national, regional and international levels. [[Kyoto protocol]] and [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) plays the most important role in addressing climate change at an international level.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/climatechange/pages/gateway/the-negotiations/the-un-climate-change-convention-and-the-kyoto-protocol&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of combating climate change led to the adoption of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] by 191 states, an agreement encouraging the reduction of [[greenhouse gases]], mainly {{CO2}}. Since developed economies produce more emissions per capita, limiting emissions in all countries inhibits opportunities for emerging economies, the only major success in efforts to produce a global response to the phenomenon.

Two decades following the [[Brundtland Report]], however, there has been no improvement in the key indicators highlighted.

===Biodiversity===

Environmental governance for protecting the [[biodiversity]] has to act in many levels. Biodiversity is fragile because it is threatened by almost all human actions. To promote conservation of biodiversity, agreements and laws have to be created to regulate agricultural activities, [[urban growth]], [[industrialization]] of countries, [[resource use|use of natural resources]], control of [[invasive species]],  the correct use of water and protection of [[air quality]]. Before making any decision for a region or country decision makers, politicians and community have to take into account what are the potential impacts for biodiversity, that any project can have.

[[Population growth]] and [[urbanization]] have been a great contributor for deforestation. Also, population growth requires more intense agricultural areas use, which also results in necessity of new areas to be deforested. This causes [[habitat loss]], which is one of the major threats for biodiversity. Habitat loss and  [[habitat fragmentation]] affects all species, because they all rely on limited resources, to feed on and to breed.&lt;ref&gt;Steffan-Dewenter &amp; Tscharntkae, 2000 ‘Butterfly community structure in fragmented habitats’  Ecology Letters, vol. 3, pp. 449-456.&lt;/ref&gt;

‘''Species are genetically unique and irreplaceable their loss is irreversible. Ecosystems vary across a vast range of parameters, and similar ecosystems (whether wetlands, forests, coastal reserves etc) cannot be presumed to be interchangeable, such that the loss of one can be compensated by protection or restoration of another''’.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN 2010 ‘Environmental Governance’ viewed 28 May 2014, www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/environmental_law/elp_work/elp_work_issues/elp_work_governance&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid habitat loss, and consequently biodiversity loss, politicians and lawmakers should be aware of the precautionary principle, which means that before approving a project or law all the pros and cons should be carefully analysed. Sometimes the impacts are not explicit, or not even proved to exist. However, if there is any chance of an irreversible impact happen, it should be taken into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN 2007 ‘Guidelines for applying the precautionary principle to biodiversity conservation and  natural resource management’ viewed 28 May 2014, cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/ln250507_ppguidelines.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

To promote environmental governance for biodiversity protection there has to be a clear articulation between values and interests while negotiating environmental management plans.&lt;ref&gt;Sampford, C 2002 ‘Environmental governance for biodiversity’ Environmental Science &amp; Policy, vol. 5, pp. 79-90.&lt;/ref&gt; International agreements are good way to have it done right.

The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) was signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 human activities. The CBD’s objectives are: “to conserve biological diversity, to use biological diversity in a sustainable fashion, to share the benefits of biological diversity fairly and equitably.” The Convention is the first global agreement to address all aspects of biodiversity: genetic resources, species and ecosystems. It recognizes, for the first time, that the conservation of biological diversity is “a common concern for all humanity”. The       Convention encourages joint efforts on measures for scientific and technological cooperation, access to genetic resources and the transfer of clean environmental technologies.

The Convention on Biological Diversity most important edition happened in 2010 when the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the Aichi Targets, were launched. These two projects together make the United Nations decade on Biodiversity. It was held in Japan and has the targets of ‘''halting and eventually reversing the loss of biodiversity of the planet''’.&lt;ref name="cbd.int"&gt;Convention on Biodiversity 2010 ‘Strategic Goals &amp; Targets for 2020’ viewed 28  May 2014, www.cbd.int/2011-2020/goals/&lt;/ref&gt;  The Strategic Plan for Biodiversity has the goal to ‘''promote its overall vision of living in harmony with nature''’ As result (...) ‘''mainstream biodiversity at different levels. Throughout the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity, governments are encouraged to develop, implement and communicate the results of national strategies for implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity''’.&lt;ref name="cbd.int"/&gt; According to the CBD &lt;ref name="cbd.int"/&gt; the five Aichi targets are:
#‘''Address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity across government and society'';
#''Reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity and promote sustainable use'';
#''Improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species and [[genetic diversity]]'';
#''Enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity and [[ecosystem services]]'';
#''Enhance implementation through [[participatory planning]], [[knowledge management]] and [[capacity building]]''.’

=== Water ===

The 2003 [[UN World Water Development Report]] claimed that the amount of water available over the next twenty years would drop by 30%.{{update|date=September 2013}}
In the same report, it is indicated that in 1998, 2.2 million people died from diarrhoeal diseases.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (2003). ''World Water Development Report 1: "Water for People, Water for Life"''. Retrieved from: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001297/129726e.pdf#page=27&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the UK’s [[WaterAid]] charity reported that one child died every 15 seconds from water-linked diseases.

According to Alliance 21&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article501.html Proposals Related to the Water Issue]&lt;/ref&gt; “All levels of water supply management are necessary and independent. The integrated approach to the catchment areas must take into account the needs of [[irrigation]] and those of towns, jointly and not separately as is often seen to be the case....The governance of a water supply must be guided by the principles of sustainable development.”

[[Australia]]n [[water resources]] have always been variable but they are becoming increasingly so with changing climate conditions. Because of how limited water resources are in Australia, there needs to be an effective implementation of environmental governance conducted within the country. Water restrictions are an important policy device used in Australian environmental governance to limit the amount of water used in urban and agricultural environments (Beeton et al. 2006). There is increased pressure on surface water resources in Australia because of the uncontrolled growth in [[groundwater]] use and the constant threat of drought. These increased pressures not only affect the quantity and quality of the waterways but they also negatively affect biodiversity. The government needs to create policies that preserve, protect and monitor Australia’s inland water. The most significant environmental governance policy imposed by the Australian government is environmental flow allocations that allocate water to the natural environment. The proper implementation of water trading systems could help to conserve water resources in Australia. Over the years there has been an increase in demand for water, making Australia the third largest per capita user of water in the world (Beeton et al. 2006). If this trend continues, the gap between supply and demand will need to be addressed. The government needs to implement more efficient water allocations and raise water rates (UNEP, 2014). By changing public perception to promote the action of reusing and recycling water some of the stress of water shortages can be alleviated.  More extensive solutions like desalination plants, building more dams and using aquifer storage are all options that could be taken to conserve water levels but all these methods are controversial. With caps on surface water use, both urban and rural consumers are turning to groundwater use; this has caused groundwater levels to decline significantly. Groundwater use is very hard to monitor and regulate. There is not enough research currently being conducted to accurately determine sustainable yields. Some regions are seeing improvement in groundwater levels by applying caps on bores and the amount of water that consumers are allowed to extract. There have been projects in environmental governance aimed at restoring vegetation in the riparian zone. Restoring riparian vegetation helps increase biodiversity, reduce salinity, prevent soil erosion and prevent riverbank collapse. Many rivers and waterways are controlled by weirs and locks that control the flow of rivers and also prevent the movement of fish. The government has funded fish-ways on some weirs and locks to allow for native fish to move upstream. Wetlands have significantly suffered under restricted water resources with water bird numbers dropping and a decrease in species diversity. The allocation of water for bird breeding through environmental flows in [[Macquarie Marshes]] has led to an increase in breeding (Beeton et al. 2006). Because of dry land salinity throughout Australia there has been an increase in the levels of salt in Australian waterways. There has been funding in salt interception schemes which help to improve in-stream salinity levels but whether river salinity has improved or not is still unclear because there is not enough data available yet. High salinity levels are dangerous because they can negatively affect larval and juvenile stages of certain fish. The introduction of invasive species into waterways has negatively affected native aquatic species because invasive species compete with native species and alter natural habitats. There has been research in producing [[daughterless carp]] to help eradicate carp. Government funding has also gone into building in-stream barriers that trap the carp and prevent them from moving into floodplains and wetlands.  Investment in national and regional programmes like the Living Murray (MDBC), Healthy Waterways Partnership and the Clean Up the Swan Programme are leading to important environmental governance. The Healthy Rivers programme promotes restoration and recovery of environmental flows, riparian re-vegetation and aquatic pest control.  The Living Murray programme has been crucial for the allocation of water to the environment by creating an agreement to recover 500 billion litres of water to the Murray River environment. Environmental governance and water resource management in Australia must be constantly monitored and adapted to suit the changing environmental conditions within the country (Beeton et al. 2006). If environmental programmes are governed with transparency there can be a reduction in policy fragmentation and an increase in policy efficiency (Mclntyre, 2010). In Arab countries, the extensive use of water for agriculture also needs critical attention since agriculture in this region has less contribution for its national income.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ozone layer===

On 16 September 1987 the United Nations General Assembly signed the [[Montreal Protocol]] to address the declining [[ozone layer]]. Since that time, the use of [[chlorofluorocarbons]] (industrial refrigerants and aerosols) and farming fungicides such as [[methyl bromide]] has mostly been eliminated, although other damaging gases are still in use.&lt;ref&gt;Gareau, Brian J. From Precaution to Profit: Contemporary Challenges to Global Environmental Protection in the Montreal Protocol (2013, Yale University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear risk===

The [[Nuclear non-proliferation treaty]] is the primary multilateral agreement governing nuclear activity.

===Transgenic organisms===
[[Genetically modified organisms]] are not the subject of any major multilateral agreements. They are the subject of various restrictions at other levels of governance. GMOs are in widespread use in the US, but are heavily restricted in many other jurisdictions.

Controversies have ensued over [[golden rice]], [[AquAdvantage salmon|genetically modified salmon]], [[Monsanto#Seeds|genetically modified seeds]], disclosure and other topics.

=== Precautionary principle ===

The [[precautionary principle]] or precautionary approach states that if an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public or to the environment, in the absence of scientific consensus that the action or policy is harmful, the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those taking an action. As of 2013 it was not the basis of major multilateral agreements.
The Precautionary Principle is put into effect if there is a chance that proposed action may cause harm to the society or the environment. Therefore, those involved in the proposed action must provide evidence that it will not be harmful, even if scientists do not believe that it will cause harm. It falls upon the policymakers to make the optimal decision, if there is any risk, even without any credible scientific evidence. However, taking precautionary action also means that there is an element of cost involved, either social or economic. So if the cost was seen as insignificant the action would be taken without the implementation of the precautionary principle.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, BD 2000, 'Applying the precautionary principle to the environment', Bulletin Of The World Health Organization, 78, 9, p. 1159, Health Business Elite, EBSCOhost, viewed 17 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; But often the cost is ignored, which can lead to harmful repercussions. This is often the case with industry and scientists who are primarily concerned with protecting their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;European Report 25 Jan. 2013"ENVIRONMENT : PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE: EEA REPORT DAMNING TO INDUSTRY."Academic OneFile. Web. 17 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socio-environmental conflicts ===
Leading experts have emphasized on the importance of taking into account the security aspects the environment and natural resources will cause. The twenty-first century is looking into a future with an increase in mass migrations of refugees, wars and praetorian regimes caused by the effect of environmental degradation such as water scarcity, deforestation and soil erosion, air pollution and, climate change effects such as rising sea levels. For a long time, foreign-policy challenges have focused on social causes as being the only reason for social and political changes. However, it is a crucial moment to understand and take into consideration the security implications that environmental stress will bring to the current political and social structure around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Robert D.|date=February 1994|title=The Coming Anarchy: How scarcity, crime, overpopulation,tribalism, and disease are rapidly destroying the social fabric of our planet.|url=|journal=The Atlantic|volume=GLOBAL|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agreements==

===Conventions===

The main multilateral conventions, also known as Rio Conventions, are as follows:

[[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) (1992–1993): aims to conserve biodiversity. Related agreements include the [http://www.cbd.int/doc/legal/cartagena-protocol-en.pdf Cartagena Protocol] on biosafety.

[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCC) (1992–1994): aims to stabilize concentrations of greenhouse gases at a level that would [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|stabilize the climate system]] without threatening food production, and enabling the pursuit of sustainable economic development; it incorporates the [[Kyoto Protocol]].

[[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD) (1994–1996): aims to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought and desertification, in developing countries (Though initially the convention was primarily meant for Africa).

Further conventions:
* [http://www.ramsar.org Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance] (1971–1975)
* [http://whc.unesco.org UNESCO World Heritage Convention]  (1972–1975)
* [http://www.cites.org Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES)] (1973–1975)
* [http://www.cms.int Bonn Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species] (1979–1983)
* [http://www.unece.org/env/water Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention)] (1992–1996)
* [http://www.basel.int Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal] (1989–1992)
* [http://www.pic.int Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedures for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade]
* [http://www.pops.int Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (COP)] (2001–2004)

The Rio Conventions are characterized by:

* obligatory execution by signatory states
* involvement in a sector of global environmental governance
* focus on the fighting poverty and the development of sustainable living conditions;
* funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for countries with few financial resources;
* inclusion of a for assessing ecosystem status&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millenniumassessment.org/fr/index.aspx Millennium assessment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental conventions are regularly criticized for their:

* rigidity and verticality: they are too descriptive, homogenous and top down, not reflecting the diversity and complexity of environmental issues. Signatory countries struggle to translate objectives into concrete form and incorporate them consistently;
* duplicate structures and aid: the sector-specific format of the conventions produced duplicate structures and procedures. Inadequate cooperation between government ministries;
* contradictions and incompatibility: e.g., “if reforestation projects to reduce {{CO2}} give preference to monocultures of exotic species, this can have a negative impact on biodiversity (whereas natural regeneration can strengthen both biodiversity and the conditions needed for life).”&lt;ref name="inforesources2005"/&gt;

Until now, the formulation of environmental policies at the international level has been divided by theme, sector or territory, resulting in treaties that overlap or clash. International attempts to coordinate environment institutions, include the Inter-Agency Coordination Committee and the [[Commission for Sustainable Development]], but these institutions are not powerful enough to effectively incorporate the three aspects of sustainable development.{{sfn|Kanie|Haas|2004}}

===Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs)===

MEAs are agreements between several countries that apply internationally or regionally and concern a variety of environmental questions. As of 2013 over 500 Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), including 45 of global scope involve at least 72 signatory countries.&lt;ref name=inomata&gt;Inomata, Tadanori; Management Review of Environmental Governance within the United Nations System; United Nations; Joint Inspection Unit; Geneva; 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Prue|title=Multilateral Environmental Agreement Negotiator’s Handbook: Pacific Region 2013|date=2013|publisher=Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme / New Zealand Centre for Environmental Law, University of Auckland|location=Samoa / New Zealand|isbn=978-982-04-0475-5|url=http://www.sprep.org/attachments/Publications/EMG/MEA_Handbook_2013.pdf|author2=Stroud, Lucy |author3=Peteru, Clark }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further agreements cover regional environmental problems, such as [[deforestation in Borneo]] or pollution in the Mediterranean. Each agreement has a specific mission and objectives ratified by multiple states.

Many Multilateral Environmental Agreements have been negotiated with the support from the United Nations Environmental Programme and work towards the achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals as a means to instil sustainable practices for the environment and its people.&lt;ref name="Steiner, A 2010 pp. 1-136"&gt;Steiner, A &amp; Oviir, M (2010) ‘Auditing the Implementation of Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs): A Primer for Auditors’, United Nations Environment Programme, pp. 1-136&lt;/ref&gt; Multilateral Environmental Agreements are considered to present enormous opportunities for greener societies and economies which can deliver numerous benefits in addressing food, energy and water security and in achieving sustainable development.&lt;ref name="Steiner, A 2010 pp. 1-136"/&gt; These agreements can be implemented on a global or regional scale, for example the issues surrounding the disposal of hazardous waste can be implemented on a regional level as per the Bamako Convention on the Ban of the Import into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Waste within Africa which applies specifically to Africa, or the global approach to hazardous waste such as the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal which is monitored throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Steiner, A 2010 pp. 1-136"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;African Union, (2010) ‘Bamako Convention on the Ban of the Import into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Wastes within Africa’, African Union, accessed on 16 May 2014 via &lt;http://www.au.int/en/content/bamako-convention-ban-import-africa-and-control-transboundary-movement-and-management-hazard&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basil Action Network (2011) ‘The Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal’, Basil Action Network, accessed on 16 May 2014 via &lt;http://ban.org/about_basel_conv/treaty_text.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

“The environmental governance structure defined by the Rio and Johannesburg Summits is sustained by [http://en.coredem.info/wiki/Environmental_governance#International_institutions UNEP], MEAs and developmental organizations and consists of assessment and policy development, as well as project implementation at the country level.

"The governance structure consists of a chain of phases:

* a) assessment of environment status;
* b) international policy development;
* c) formulation of MEAs;
* d) policy implementation;
* e) policy assessment;
* f) enforcement;
* g) sustainable development.

"Traditionally, UNEP has focused on the normative role of engagement in the first three
phases. Phases (d) to (f) are covered by MEAs and the sustainable development phase involves developmental organizations such as UNDP and the World Bank.”&lt;ref name=inomata/&gt;

Lack of coordination affects the development of coherent governance. The report shows that donor states support development organizations, according to their individual interests. They do not follow a joint plan, resulting in overlaps and duplication. MEAs tend not to become a joint frame of reference and therefore receive little financial support. States and organizations emphasize existing regulations rather than improving and adapting them.&lt;ref name=inomata/&gt;

==Background==

The risks associated with nuclear fission raised global awareness of environmental threats. The 1963 [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] prohibiting atmospheric nuclear testing was the beginning of the globalization of environmental issues. Environmental law began to be modernized and coordinated with the [[Stockholm Conference]] (1972), backed up in 1980 by the Vienna Convention on the [[Law of treaties|Law of Treaties]].&lt;ref&gt;Di Mento, Josep; The Global Environment and International law, University of Texas Press; 2003; p 7..&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]] was signed and ratified in 1985. In 1987, 24 countries signed the [[Montreal Protocol]] which imposed the gradual withdrawal of CFCs.

The [[Brundtland Report]], published in 1987 by the [[Earth Summit|UN Commission on Environment and Development]], stipulated the need for economic development that “meets the needs of the present without compromising the capacity of future generations to meet their needs.

===Rio Conference (1992) and reactions===

The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), better known as the 1992 [[Earth Summit]], was the first major international meeting since the end of the [[Cold War]] and was attended by delegations from 175 countries. Since then the biggest international conferences that take place every 10 years guided the global governance process with a series of MEAs. Environmental treaties are applied with the help of [[secretariats]].

Governments created international treaties in the 1990s to check global threats to the environment. These treaties are far more restrictive than global protocols and set out to change non-sustainable production and consumption models.&lt;ref name=boug&gt;Bouguerra, Larbi; La consommation assassine. Comment le mode de vie des uns ruine celui des autres, pistes pour u ne consommation responsible (Consumption Kills. How some people’s lifestyles ruin other people’s lives. Ideas for responsible consumption) ; Éditions Charles Léopold Mayer; 2005; adaptation of State of the World. Special Focus - The Consumer Society; The Worldwatch Institute; 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agenda 21===

[[Agenda 21]] is a detailed plan of actions to be implemented at the global, national and local levels by UN organizations, member states and key individual groups in all regions. Agenda 21 advocates making sustainable development a legal principle law. At the local level, local Agenda 21 advocates an inclusive, territory-based strategic plan, incorporating sustainable environmental and social policies.

The Agenda has been accused of using [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] principles, including free trade to achieve environmental goals. For example, chapter two, entitled “International Cooperation to Accelerate Sustainable Development in Developing Countries and Related Domestic Policies” states, “The international economy should provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals by: promoting sustainable development through trade liberalization.”

==Actors==

===International institutions===

====United Nations Environment Program====
{{main|United Nations Environment Program}}
The UNEP has had its biggest impact as a monitoring and advisory body, and in developing environmental agreements. It has also contributed to strengthening the institutional capacity of environment ministries.

In 2002 UNEP held a conference to focus on product lifecycle impacts, emphasizing the fashion, advertising, financial and retail industries, seen as key agents in promoting sustainable consumption.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt;

According to Ivanova, UNEP adds value in environmental monitoring, scientific assessment and information sharing, but cannot lead all environmental management processes. She proposed the following tasks for UNEP:

* initiate a strategic independent overhaul of its mission;
* consolidate the financial information and transparency process;
* restructure organizing governance by creating an operative executive council that balances the omnipresence of the overly imposing and fairly ineffectual Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum (GMEF).

Other proposals offer a new mandate to “produce greater unity amongst social and environmental agencies, so that the concept of ‘environment for development’ becomes a reality. It needs to act as a platform for establishing standards and for other types of interaction with national and international organizations and the United Nations. The principles of cooperation and [http://www.amisdelaterre.org/Des-responsabilites-communes-mais.html common but differentiated responsibilities] should be reflected in the application of this revised mandate.”&lt;ref&gt;Reforming International Environmental Governance: Statement representing views expressed at two meetings of stakeholders held at the 24th Session of the UNEP Governing Council/GMEF 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sherman proposed principles to strengthen UNEP:

* obtain a social consensus on a long-term vision;
* analyze the current situation and future scenarios;
* produce a comprehensive plan covering all aspects of sustainable development;
* build on existing strategies and processes;
* multiply links between national and local strategies;
* include all these points in the financial and budget plan;
* adopt fast controls to improve process piloting and identification of progress made;
* implement effective participation mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/president/62/issues/environmentalgov/Statement%20on%20IEG%20by%20civil%20society.pdf Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future, et al (comp.); Options for Strengthening the Environment Pillar of Sustainable Development. Compilation of Civil Society Proposals on the Institutional Framework for the United Nations' Environmental Activities; 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group stated, “Consider the specific needs of developing countries and respect of the fundamental principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities'. Developed countries should promote technology transfer, new and additional financial resources, and capacity building for meaningful participation of developing countries in international environmental governance. Strengthening of international environmental governance should occur in the context of sustainable development and should involve civil society as an important stakeholder and agent of transformation.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stakeholderforum.org/policy/ieg/SubmissionsToThePanel/BRAZILIANFORUMOFNGOS.pdf Submission by the Brazilian Forum of NGOs and Social Movements for the Environment and the Development to the Panel Consultation with Civil Society; June 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global Environment Facility (GEF)====
{{main|Global Environment Facility}}
Created in 1991, the Global Environment Facility is an independent financial organization initiated by donor governments including Germany and France. It was the first financial organization dedicated to the environment at the global level. As of 2013 it had 179 members. Donations are used for projects covering biodiversity, climate change, international waters, destruction of the ozone layer, soil degradation and [[persistent organic pollutant]]s.

GEF's institutional structure includes UNEP, UNDP and the World Bank. It is the funding mechanism for the four environmental conventions: climate change, biodiversity, persistent organic pollutants and desertification. GEF transfers resources from developed countries to developing countries to fund UNDP, UNEP and World Bank projects. The World Bank manages the annual budget of US$561.10 million.&lt;ref name=young2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Zoë |first=Young |title=A new green order: The World Bank and the politics of the global environmental facility |publisher=Pluto Press |location=London |year=2002 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GEF has been criticized for its historic links with the World Bank, at least during its first phase during the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Andler, Lydia; The Secretariat of the Global Environment Facility: From Network to Bureaucracy; "Global Governance Working Paper", no. 24; Amsterdam et al.; The Global Governance Project; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and for having favoured certain regions to the detriment of others.&lt;ref&gt;Werksman, Jake; Consolidating global environmental governance: New lessons from the GEF?; in {{harvnb|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view sees it as contributing to the emergence of a global "green market". It represents “an adaptation (of the World Bank) to this emerging world order, as a response to the emergence of environmental movements that are becoming a geopolitical force.”{{sfn|Zoë2002|p=3}}  Developing countries demanded financial transfers to help them protect their environment.

GEF is subject to economic profitability criteria, as is the case for all the [http://en.coredem.info/wiki/Environmental_governance#Conventions conventions]. It received more funds in its first three years than the UNEP has since its creation in 1972. GEF funding represents less than 1% of development aid between 1992 and 2002.{{sfn|Zoë2002|p=3}}

====United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD)====
{{main|Commission on Sustainable Development}}
This intergovernmental institution meets twice a year to assess follow-up on Rio Summit goals. The CSD is made up of 53 member states, elected every three years and was reformed in 2004 to help improve implementation of Agenda 21. It meets twice a year, focusing on a specific theme during each two-year period: 2004-2005 was dedicated to water and 2006-2007 to climate change. The CSD has been criticized for its low impact, general lack of presence and the absence of Agenda 21 at the state level specifically, according to a report by the [[World Resources Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.wri.org/pubs/pubs_pdf.cfm?PubID=3764 World Resources Institute; World Resources 2002–2004: Decisions for the Earth: Balance, Voice and Power; Washington DC; 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission focuses on sequencing actions and establishing agreements puts it in conflict with institutions such as UNEP and OECD.&lt;ref name=Najam&gt;[http://www.iisd.org/pdf/2006/geg.pdf Najam, A., Papa, M. and Taiyab, N. Global Environmental Governance. A Reform Agenda; IISD; 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====World Environment Organization (WEO)====
{{main|United Nations Environment Organization}}
A proposed World Environment Organization, analogous to the [[World Health Organization]] could be capable of adapting treaties and enforcing international standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.coredem.info/wiki/Environmental_governance#Proposals proposals]&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union, particularly France and Germany, and a number of NGOs favour creating a WEO. The United Kingdom, the US and most developing countries prefer to focus on voluntary initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iddri.org/Publications/Collections/Syntheses/Gouvernance-internationale-de-l'environnement-les-prochaines-etapes Tubiana, L.; Martimort-Asso, B.; Gouvernance internationale de l'environnement: les prochaines étapes (International Environmental Governance; the next stages)]; in "Synthèse", 2005, no. 01, Institut du développement durable et des relations internationales (IDDRI).&lt;/ref&gt; WEO partisans maintain that it could offer better political leadership, improved legitimacy and more efficient coordination. Its detractors argue that existing institutions and missions already provide appropriate environmental governance; however the lack of coherence and coordination between them and the absence of clear division of responsibilities prevents them from greater effectiveness.{{sfn|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;ref name=unep/&gt;

====World Bank====
{{main|World Bank}}
The World Bank influences environmental governance through other actors, particularly the GEF. The World Bank’s mandate is not sufficiently defined in terms of environmental governance despite the fact that it is included in its mission. However, it allocates 5 to 10% of its annual funds to environmental projects. The institution's capitalist vocation means that its investment is concentrated solely in areas which are profitable in terms of cost benefits, such as climate change action and ozone layer protection, whilst neglecting other such as adapting to climate change and desertification. Its financial autonomy means that it can make its influence felt indirectly on the creation of standards, and on international and regional negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Marschinski, Robert; Behrle, Steffen; The World Bank: Making the Business Case for the Environment; "Global Governance Working Paper No 21"; Amsterdam et al; The Global Governance Project; 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following intense criticism in the 1980s for its support for destructive projects which, amongst other consequences, caused deforestation of tropical forests, the World Bank drew up its own environment-related standards in the 1990s so it could correct its actions. These standards differ from UNEP’s standards, meant to be the benchmark, thus discrediting the institution and sowing disorder and conflict in the world of environmental governance. Other financial institutions, regional development banks and the private sector also drew up their own standards. Criticism is not directed at the World Bank’s standards in themselves, which Najam considered as “robust”,&lt;ref name=Najam/&gt; but at their legitimacy and efficacy.

===== GEF =====

The [[Global Environment Facility|GEF]]'s account of itself as of 2012 [http://www.thegef.org/gef/whatisgef] is as "the largest public funder of projects to improve the global environment", period, which "provides grants for projects related to biodiversity, climate change, international waters, land degradation, the ozone layer, and persistent organic pollutants."  It claims to have provided "$10.5 billion in grants and leveraging $51 billion in co-financing for over 2,700 projects in over 165 countries [and] made more than 14,000 small grants directly to civil society and community-based organizations, totaling $634 million."  It serves as mechanism for the:
*[[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD)
*[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC)
*[[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] (POPs)
*[[Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD)
*implementation of [[Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer]] in some countries with "economies in transition" [http://www.thegef.org/gef/whatisgef]
This mandate reflects the restructured GEF as of October 2011 [http://www.thegef.org/gef/instrument].

====World Trade Organization (WTO)====
{{main|World Trade Organization}}
The WTO’s mandate does not include a specific principle on the environment. All the problems linked to the environment are treated in such a way as to give priority to trade requirements and the principles of the WTO’s own trade system. This produces conflictual situations. Even if the WTO recognizes the existence of MEAs, it denounces the fact that around 20 MEAs are in conflict with the WTO’s trade regulations. Furthermore, certain MEAs can allow a country to ban or limit trade in certain products if they do not satisfy established environmental protection requirements. In these circumstances, if one country’s ban relating to another country concerns two signatories of the same MEA, the principles of the treaty can be used to resolve the disagreement, whereas if the country affected by the trade ban with another country has not signed the agreement, the WTO demands that the dispute be resolved using the WTO’s trade principles, in other words, without taking into account the environmental consequences.

Some criticisms of the WTO mechanisms may be too broad.  In a recently dispute over labelling of [[dolphin safe label]]s for [[tuna]] between the US and Mexico, the ruling was relatively narrow and did not, as some critics claimed,

====International Monetary Fund (IMF)====
{{main|International Monetary Fund}}
The IMF’s mission is "''to ensure the stability of the international monetary system''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/about.htm/|title=IMF -- About|website=www.imf.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, "most of the 24 directors ... told Strauss-Kahn that climate was not part of the IMF's mandate and that SDR allocations are a reserve asset never intended for development issues."&lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt;

==== UN ICLEI ====

{{main|International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives}}

The UN's main body for coordinating municipal and urban decision-making&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iclei.org/ ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability]&lt;/ref&gt; is named the [[International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives]]. Its slogan is "Local Governments for Sustainability".
This body sponsored the concept of [[full cost accounting]] that makes environmental governance the foundation of other governance.

ICLEIs projects and achievements include:
*Convincing thousands of municipal leaders to sign the [[World Mayors and Municipal Leaders Declaration on Climate Change]] (2005) which notably requests of other levels of government that:
:Global trade regimes, credits and banking reserve rules be reformed to advance debt relief and incentives to implement policies and practices that reduce and mitigate climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Starting national councils to implement this and other key agreements, e.g., [[ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA]]
*Spreading [[ecoBudget]] (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. [[Guntur]]'s Municipal Corporation, one of the first four to ipmlement the entire framework.
*[[Sustainability Planning Toolkit]] (launched 2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ICLEI Releases Sustainability Toolkit |url=http://blog.accessfayetteville.org/triple_bottom_line/2009/12/iclei-releases-sustainability-toolkit.html |title=ICLEI Releases Sustainability Toolkit - Triple Bottom Line |publisher=Blog.accessfayetteville.org |date=2009-12-05 |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; integrating these and other tools
*[[Cities Climate Registry]] (launched 2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmsc2010.org/2010/11/mayors-launch-reporting-platform-of-cities-at-climate-summit/ |title=Mayors launch reporting platform of cities at Climate Summit &amp;#124; WMSC 2010 Mexico City &amp;#124; World Mayors Summit on Climate 2010 |publisher=Wmsc2010.org |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; - part of UNEP [[Campaign on Cities and Climate Change]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/urban_environment/issues/climate_change.asp |title=Urban Environment Unit , UNEP |publisher=Unep.org |date=2006-09-20 |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICLEI promotes [[best practice exchange]] among municipal governments globally, especially [[green infrastructure]], [[sustainable procurement]].

====Other secretariats====
Other international institutions incorporate environmental governance in their action plans, including:

* [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), promoting development;
* [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) which works on the climate and atmosphere;
* [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]  (FAO) working on the protection of agriculture, forests and fishing;
* [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) which focuses on nuclear security.

Over 30 UN agencies and programmes support environmental management, according to Najam.&lt;ref name=Najam/&gt; This produces a lack of coordination, insufficient exchange of information and dispersion of responsibilities. It also results in proliferation of initiatives and rivalry between them.

====Criticism====

According to Bauer, Busch and Siebenhüner,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glogov.org Bauer, Steffen; Busch, Per-Olof; Siebenhüner, Bernd; Administering International Governance: What Role for Treaty Secretariats? "Global Governance Working Paper" No 29. Amsterdam et al; The Global Governance Project; 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; the different conventions and multilateral agreements of global environmental regulation is increasing their secretariats' influence. Influence varies according to bureaucratic and leadership efficiency, choice of technical or client-centered.

The United Nations is often the target of criticism, including from within over the multiplication of secretariats due to the chaos it produces. Using a separate secretariat for each MEA creates enormous overhead given the 45 international-scale and over 500 other agreements.

===States===

====Environmental governance at the state level====

Environmental protection has created opportunities for mutual and collective monitoring among neighbouring states. The European Union provides an example of the institutionalization of joint regional and state environmental governance. Key areas include information, led by the [[European Environment Agency]] (EEA), and the production and monitoring of norms by states or local institutions.
See also the [[Environmental policy of the European Union]].

====State participation in global environmental governance====

US refusal to ratify major environment agreements produced tensions with ratifiers in Europe and Japan.

The World Bank, IMF and other institutions are dominated by the developed countries and do not always properly consider the requirements of developing countries.

===Business===

Environmental governance applies to business as well as government. Considerations are typical of those in other domains:

*  values (vision, mission, principles);
*  policy (strategy, objectives, targets);
*  oversight (responsibility, direction, training, communication);
*  process (management systems, initiatives, internal control, monitoring and review, stakeholder dialogue, transparency, environmental accounting, reporting and verification);
*  performance (performance indicators, benchmarking, eco-efficiency, reputation, compliance, liabilities, business development).&lt;ref name=white&gt;[http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/GEHO0904BKFE-e-e.pdf White, Andrew; Klernan, Matthew; Corporate Environment Governance. A Study into the Influence of Environmental Governance and the Financial Performance; Environment Agency (United Kingdom Government); 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;

White and Klernan among others discuss the correlation between environmental governance and financial performance. This correlation is higher in sectors where environmental impacts are greater.&lt;ref name=white/&gt;

Business environmental issues include emissions, biodiversity, historical liabilities, product and material waste/recycling, energy use/supply and many others.&lt;ref name=white/&gt;

Environmental governance has become linked to traditional corporate governance as an increasing number of shareholders are corporate environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wallacepartners.net/governance.html |title=Environmental Governance |publisher=Wallace Partners |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate governance is the set of [[Business process|processes]], customs, [[policies]], laws, and institutions affecting the way a [[corporation]] (or [[company]]) is managed. Corporate [[governance]] is affected by the relationships among [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. These stakeholders research and quantify performance to compare and contrast the environmental performance of thousands of companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wallacepartners.net/stakeholders.html |title=Priority Stakeholders |publisher=Wallace Partners |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large corporations with global supply chains evaluate the environmental performance of business partners and suppliers for marketing and ethical reasons. Some consumers seek environmentally friendly and sustainable products and companies.

===Non-governmental organizations===
{{Main|Non-governmental organizations}}
According to Bäckstrand and Saward,&lt;ref name=Saward/&gt; “broader participation by non-state actors in multilateral environmental decisions (in varied roles such as agenda setting, campaigning, lobbying, consultation, monitoring, and implementation) enhances the democratic legitimacy of environmental governance.”

Local activism is capable of gaining the support of the people and authorities to combat environmental degradatation. In Cotacachi, Ecuador, a social movement used a combination of education, direct action, the influence of local public authorities and denunciation of the mining company’s plans in its own country, Canada, and the support of international environmental groups to influence mining activity.&lt;ref&gt;Bebbington, Anthony; et al.; Los movimientos sociales frente a la minería: disputando el desarrollo territorial andino (Social Movements and Mining: disputes over territorial development in the Andes); in J. Bengoa (ed.) "Movimientos sociales y desarrollo territorial rural en América Latina" (Social Movements and Territorial Rural Development in Latin America). Catalonia; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher cites cases in which multiple strategies were used to effect change.&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;Fisher, Dana R.; Civil Society Protest and Participation: Civic Engagement Within the Multilateral Governance Regime pp. 176-201; in {{harvnb|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; She describes civil society groups that pressure international institutions and also organize local events. Local groups can take responsibility for environmental governance in place of governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/hawaii/howwework/community-based-marine-conservation.xml |title=Community-Based Marine Conservation &amp;#124; The Nature Conservancy |publisher=Nature.org |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flacso.org.ec/docs/WP_005_AndradeM_01_2.pdf Andrade Mendoza, Karen; La gobernanza ambiental en el Ecuador: El conflicto alrededor de la licencia Ambiental en el bloque 31, en el parque nacional Yasuní (Environmental Governance in Ecuador:  the conflict concerning the environmental license for block 31 in the Yasuní National Park); FLACSO; Observatorio Socioambiental; Quito; 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bengoa,&lt;ref&gt;Bengoa, José; et al. Movimientos sociales, gobernanza ambiental y desarrollo territorial (Social Movements, Environmental Governance and Territorial Development) ; Catalonia; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; “social movements have contributed decisively to the creation of an institutional platform wherein the fight against poverty and exclusion has become an inescapable benchmark.” But despite successes in this area, “these institutional changes have not produced the processes for transformation that could have made substantial changes to the opportunities available to rural inhabitants, particularly the poorest and those excluded from society.” He cites several reasons:

* conflict between in-group cohesion and openness to outside influence;
* limited trust between individuals;
* contradiction between social participation and innovation;
* criticisms without credible alternatives to environmentally damaging activities

A successful initiative in Ecuador involved the establishment of stakeholder federations and management committees (NGOs, communities, municipalities and the ministry) for the management of a protected forest.&lt;ref name=poats/&gt;

==Proposals==

The [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] proposed an agenda for global governance. These objectives are:&lt;ref name=Najam/&gt;

* expert leadership;
* positioning science as the authoritative basis of sound environmental policy;
* coherence and reasonable coordination;
* well-managed institutions;
* incorporate environmental concerns and actions within other areas of international policy and action

=== Coherence and coordination ===

Despite the increase in efforts, actors, agreements and treaties, the global environment continue to degrade at a rapid rate. From the big hole in Earth’s ozone layer to over-fishing to the uncertainties of climate change, the world is confronted by several intrinsically global challenges.&lt;ref name="ProsConsMultiplicity"&gt;{{cite web

| access-date=30 March 2018
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the environmental agenda becomes more complicated and extensive, the current system has proven ineffective in addressing and tackling problems related to trans-boundary externalities and the environment is still experiencing degradation at unprecedented levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilkinson | first = Rorden | title = Global governance : critical perspectives | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780203302804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inforesources&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inforesources.ch/pdf/focus_3_05_e.pdf ''Global Conventions and Environmental Governance'']&lt;/ref&gt; identifies four major obstacles to global environmental governance, and describes measures in response. The four obstacles are:

* parallel structures and competition, without a coherent strategy
* contradictions and incompatibilities, without appropriate compromise
* competition between multiple agreements with incompatible objectives, regulations and processes
* integrating policy from macro- to micro- scales.

Recommended measures:

* MDGs (Millennium Development Goals)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/ UN Millenium Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; and conventions, combining sustainability and reduction of poverty and equity;
* country-level approach linking global and local scales
* coordination and division of tasks in a multilateral approach that supports developing countries and improves coordination between donor countries and institutions
* use of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/np/prsp/prsp.aspx Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers]&lt;/ref&gt; in development planning
* transform conflicts into tradeoffs, synergies and win-win options

Contemporary debates surrounding global environmental governance have converged on the idea of developing a stronger and more effective institutional framework. The views on how to achieve this, however, still hotly debated. Currently, rather than teaming up with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), international environmental responsibilities have been spread across many different agencies including: a) specialised agencies within the UN system such as the World Meteorological Organisation, the International Maritime Organisation and others; b) the programs in the UN system such as the UN Development Program; c) the UN regional economic and social commission; d) the Bretton Woods institutions; e) the World Trade Organisation and; f) the environmentally focused mechanisms such as the Global Environment Facility and close to 500 international environmental agreements.&lt;ref name="ProsConsMultiplicity"/&gt;

Some analysts also argue that multiple institutions and some degree of overlap and duplication in policies is necessary to ensure maximum output from the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| date=November 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst there are various arguments for and against a WEO, the key challenge, however, remains the same: how to develop a rational and effective framework that will protect the global environment efficiently.

=== Democratization ===

Starting in 2002, Saward&lt;ref name=Saward/&gt; and others began to view the [[Earth Summit]] process as capable opening up the possibility of stakeholder democracy. The summits were deliberative rather than simply participative, with NGOs, women, men, indigenous peoples and businesses joining the decision-making process alongside states and international organizations, characterized by:

* the importance given to scientific and technical considerations
* the official and unofficial participation of many actors with heterogeneous activity scopes
* growing uncertainty
* a new interpretation of [[international law]] and social organization models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Behnassi | first1 = Mohamed |title= Les négociations environnementales multilatérales: Vers une gouvernance environnementale mondiale (Multilateral Environmental Negotiations: towards world environmental governance) |journal= C Durable: Doctoral thesis summary paper|date= 2003|url=http://cdurable.info/Les-Negociations-Environnementales-Multinationales-NEM-vers-une-Gouvernance-Environnementale-Mondiale-GEM,1136.html|location=Casablanca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the absence of joint rules for composing such fora leads to the development of non-transparent relations that favour the more powerful stakeholders. Criticisms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Johal | first1 = Surjinder | last2 = Ulph | first2 = Alistair | title = Globalization, lobbying, and international environmental governance | journal = Review of International Economics | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 387–403 | publisher = Wiley | doi = 10.1111/1467-9396.00339 | date = August 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9396.00339 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; assert that they act more as a lobbying platform, wherein specific interest groups attempt to influence governments.

===Institutional reform===

Actors inside and outside the United Nations are discussing possibilities for global environmental governance that provides a solution to current problems of fragility, coordination and coherence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/UN/UNPAN021755.pdf Resolution 60/1 of the United Nations General Assembly.]&lt;/ref&gt; Deliberation is focusing on the goal of making UNEP more efficient. A 2005 resolution recognizes “the need for more efficient environmental activities in the United Nations system, with enhanced coordination, improved policy advice and guidance, strengthened scientific knowledge, assessment and cooperation, better treaty compliance, while respecting the legal autonomy of the treaties, and better integration of environmental activities in the broader sustainable development framework.”

Proposals include:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/president/62/issues/environmentalgov/resolution230708.pdf UN environmental governance report]&lt;/ref&gt;

* greater and better coordination between agencies;
* strengthen and acknowledge UNEP’s scientific role;
* identify MEA areas to strengthen coordination, cooperation and teamwork between different agreements;
* increase regional presence;
* implement the [[Bali Strategic Plan]] on improving technology training and support for the application of environmental measures in poor countries;
* demand that UNEP and MEAs participate formally in all relevant WTO committees as observers.
* strengthen its financial situation;
* improve secretariats’ efficiency and effectiveness.

One of the main studies addressing this issue proposes:

* clearly divide tasks between development organizations, UNEP and the MEAs
* adopt a political direction{{clarify|date=September 2013}} for environmental protection and sustainable development
* authorize the UNEP Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum to adopt the UNEP medium-term strategy
* allow Member States to formulate and administer MEAs an independent secretariat for each convention
* support UNEP in periodically assessing MEAs and ensure coordination and coherence
* establish directives for setting up national/regional platforms capable of incorporating MEAs in the Common Country Assessment (CCA) process and [[United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF)]]&lt;ref&gt;The CCA is the main diagnostic tool available for teams working in UN countries and their partners. It is used to assess and create a shared understanding of the underlying challenges facing a country during its development. The UNDAF is a product of the CCA analysis and collaboration process and provides the basis for UN cooperation programmes. (Source: ISDR; Words into Action: A Guide for Implementing the Hyogo Framework; United Nations; 2007; chapter 4; p. 81-120).&lt;/ref&gt;
* establish a global joint planning framework
* study the aptitude and efficiency of environmental activities’ funding, focusing on differential costs
* examine and redefine the concept of funding differential costs as applicable to existing financial mechanisms
* reconsider remits, division of tasks and responsibilities between entities that provide services to the multipartite conferences. Clearly define the services that UN offices provide to MEA secretariats
* propose measures aiming to improve personnel provision and geographic distribution for MEA secretariats
* improve transparency resource use for supporting programmes and in providing services to MEAs. Draw up a joint budget for services supplied to MEAs.

===Education===

A 2001 Alliance 21 report proposes six fields of action:&lt;ref&gt;Ziaka, Yolanda; Robicon, Philippe; Souchon, Christian; Environmental Education: Six Proposals for Citizens’ Action. Proposal Paper, [http://www.alliance21.org Alliance for a Responsible, Plural and United World]; 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

* strengthen citizens' critical faculties to ensure greater democratic control of political orientations
* develop a global and critical approach
* develop civic education training for teachers
* develop training for certain socio-professional groups
* develop environmental education for the entire population;
* assess the resulting experiences of civil society

===Transform daily life===

Individuals can modify consumption, based on [[voluntary simplicity]]: changes in purchasing habits, simplified lifestyles (less work, less consumption, more socialization and constructive leisure time). But individual actions must not replace vigilance and pressure on policies.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt; Notions of responsible consumption developed over decades, revealing the political nature of individual purchases, according to the principle that consumption should satisfy the population’s basic needs. These needs comprise the physical wellbeing of individuals and society, a healthy diet, access to drinking water and plumbing, education, healthcare and physical safety.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt; The general attitude centres on the need to reduce consumption and reuse and recycle materials. In the case of food consumption, local, organic and fair trade products which avoid ill treatment of animals has become a major trend.

Alternatives to the personal automobile are increasing, including public transport, car sharing and bicycles and alternative propulsion systems.

Alternative energy sources are becoming less costly.

Ecological industrial processes turn the waste from one industry into raw materials for another.

Governments can reduce subsidies/increase taxes/tighten regulation on unsustainable activities.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt;

The [[Community Environmental governance Global Alliance]] encourages holistic approaches to environmental and economic challenges, incorporating indigenous knowledge. [[Okotoks]], [[Alberta]] capped population growth based on the carrying capacity of the Sheep River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okotoks.ca/default.aspx?cid=208&amp;lang=1 |title=Okotoks - 1. Water Management |publisher=Okotoks.ca |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fraser Basin Council Watershed Governance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fraserbasin.bc.ca/ |title=Fraser Basin Council - Home |publisher=Fraserbasin.bc.ca |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in British Columbia, Canada, manages issues that span municipal jurisdictions. [[Smart Growth]] is an international movement that employs key tenets of Environmental governance in [[urban planning]].

===Policies and regulations===

Establish policies and regulations that promote “infrastructures for well being” whilst addressing the political, physical and cultural levels.

Eliminate subsidies that have a negative environmental impact and tax pollution

Promoting workers’ personal and family development.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt;

===Coordination===

A programme of national workshops on synergies between the three Rio Conventions launched in late 2000, in collaboration with the relevant secretariats. The goal was to strengthen coordination at the local level by:

* sharing information
* promoting political dialogue to obtain financial support and implement programmes
* enabling the secretariats to update their joint work programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sommetjohannesburg.org/initiatives/gouvernance-environnementale.html Diallo, Hama Arba; La gouvernance environnementale et la synergie entre les trois conventions globales (Environmental Governance and the Synergy between the Three Global Conventions); Johannesburg Summit document; 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Campbell,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Laura B.; The Effectiveness of WTO and WIPO: Lessons for Environmental Governance? in {{harvnb|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; “In the context of globalization, the question of linking up environmental themes with other subjects, such as trade, investment and conflict resolution mechanisms, as well as the economic incentives to participate in and apply agreements would seem to provide an important lesson for the effective development of environmental governance structures.” Environmental concerns would become part of the global economic system. “These problems also contain the seeds of a new generation of international conflicts that could affect both the stability of international relations and collective security. Which is why the concept of ‘collective security’ has arisen.”

Moving local decisions to the global level is as important as the way in which local initiatives and best practices are part of a global system. Kanie&lt;ref&gt;Kanie, Norichika; Global Environmental Governance in Terms of Vertical Linkages;  pp. 86-113 {{harvnb|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out that NGOs, scientists, international institutions and stakeholder partnerships can reduce the distance that separates the local and international levels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1417">'''Epistemic commitment''' is an obligation, which may be withdrawn only under appropriate circumstances, to uphold the factual truth of a given [[proposition]], and to provide reasons for one's [[belief]] in that proposition.
Epistemic means 'of, or relating to knowledge'. An epistemic commitment of some kind, on the part of the participants, underlies most [[argument]]s. For instance, each participant in an argument would have a position that they are expressing, and an underlying epistemic commitment fundamental to their reasoning.

==Example==
Joe states that [[whale]]s are gentle creatures, and as such, should never be killed.

Susan replies that [[killer whale]]s are not 'gentle', in fact, they eat [[pinniped|seal pups]].

Joe, instead of revising his earlier stated opinion of whales based on new information from Susan, asserts that killer whales must not actually be whales, because a 'true whale eats plankton.' Joe has now redefined 'whale' to suit his argument.

If Susan shows Joe a [[biology]] textbook which asserts that killer whales are, in fact whales, then Joe might (or might not) decide to withdraw his epistemic commitment to the original statement about whales.

In [[psychology]], the '''external image''' (also '''alien image''', '''foreign image''', '''public image''', '''third-party image'''; {{lang-de|Fremdbild}}) is the [[image]] other people have of a [[person]], i.e., a person's external image is the way they are viewed by other people. It contrasts with a person's [[self image]] ({{lang-de|Selbstbild}}); how the external image is communicated to a person may affect their [[self esteem]] positively or negatively.

== Definition ==

An external image is the totality of all [[perception]]s, [[feeling]]s, and [[Value judgment|judgment]]s that third parties make about an [[individual]]. These [[interpersonal perception]]s are automatically linked to earlier experiences with the person being observed, and with the feelings arising from these interactions and evaluations. The image that others have of a person shapes their expectations of this person, and significantly affects their mutual social interaction.

== External image and self image ==

A person's external image, or more precisely, how this image is communicated to the individual, and how others react to the individual as a result of his or her external image, significantly affects the person's [[self image]]. Positive, appreciative external images strengthen an individual's [[self confidence]] and [[self esteem]]. In extreme cases, negative or conflicting external images can cause [[mental illness]].

The external image is always different from an individual's self-image. From the two perspectives and the differences between them - or more accurately, the inferences that the two parties draw for themselves, social interactions evolve, influenced by the parties' own [[Self|selves]].

== In group dynamics ==
[[File:Johari_Window.PNG|right|250px|thumb|[[Johari window]]]]
Conscious handling of images about each other plays an important part in [[group dynamics]]. In [[feedback]] exercises, subjects are trained in giving and receiving external images. The [[Johari window]] describes the relationship between external and self images, and that between conscious and unconscious parts of these images. With [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindful]] "awareness exercises", a person is trained to detect previously unconscious expectations of third parties, and with communication exercises, they are trained to reconcile their own and others' images and expectations of each other.

== In psychotherapy ==

[[Psychotherapy]] also deals with external images when treating [[Clinical depression|depression]] or in dealing with the effects of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|trauma]] or [[bullying]], or more generally in counseling members of [[marginalized group]]s.

{{Nihongo|'''Freeter'''|フリーター|furītā}} is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] expression for people who lack full-time employment or are unemployed, excluding [[Housewife| housewives]] and students. The term originally included young people who deliberately chose not to become [[Salaryman |salary-men]], even though jobs were available at the time.

Freeters may also be described as ''[[underemployment |underemployed]]''. These people do not start a career after high school or university, but instead earn money from low-skilled and low-paid jobs.

The word ''freeter'' or ''freeta'' was first used around 1987 or 1988 and is thought to be a  [[portmanteau]] of the [[English language| English]] word ''free'' (or perhaps ''freelance'') and the [[German language|German]] word ''Arbeiter'' ("labourer"). ''Arubaito'' is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[gairaigo| loanword]] from ''Arbeiter'', and perhaps from ''Arbeit'' ("work"). As German (along with English) was used in Japanese universities before [[World War II]], especially for science and medicine, ''arubaito'' became common among students to describe part-time work for university students.

==History==
About 10% of high school and university graduates could not find steady employment in the spring of 2000, and a full 50% of those who could find a job left within three years after employment. The employment situation is worse for the youngest freeters.

From 2000–2009, the number of freeters increased rapidly. In 1982 there were an estimated 0.5 million freeters in Japan, 0.8 million in 1987, 1.01 million in 1992 and 1.5 million in 1997. The number for 2001 is 4.17 million freeters according to one estimate, and 2 million in 2002 according to another estimate. According to some estimates, there will be 10 million freeters in Japan by 2014.  

Many Japanese people worry about the future impact of freeters on society. If they work at all, freeters often work at convenience stores, supermarkets, fast food outlets, restaurants, and other low paying, low skill jobs. According to a survey by the Japan Institute of Labor in 2000, the average freeter works 4.9 days per week and earns [[yen|¥]]139,000 per month (ca. $1,300 U.S.). Two thirds of freeters have never had a regular, full-time job.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The rise of internet business has allowed some freeters to work from home and be self-employed. Some experts predict that [[Aging of Japan|Japan's aging population]] will create a labor shortage that will increase career options for freeters.

==Causes==
The Japan Institute of Labor classifies freeters into three groups: the "''moratorium'' type" that wants to wait before starting a career, the "''dream pursuing'' type", and the "''no alternative'' type". 
*The ''moratorium'' type of freeter wants to enjoy life, and deliberately chooses not to join the [[rat race]] of the [[Japanese work environment]].
*The ''dream pursuing'' type has specific dreams incompatible with a standard Japanese career.
*The ''no alternative'' type could not find a decent job before high school or university graduation in the system called {{nihongo|"[[simultaneous recruiting of new graduates]]" |新卒一括採用|Shinsotsu-Ikkatsu-Saiyō}}, which is unique to Japanese society.  Those left behind by ''Shinsotsu-Ikkatsu-Saiyō'' are forced to take low paying irregular jobs. This usually has to do with their [[Dropping out|dropout]] status from previous educational institutes. Those who dropped out of high school have the worst prospects.

==Effects==

===Difficulties starting their own household===
Many freeters live for free with their parents as [[parasite singles]]. Parents in Japan usually do not force their offspring out of the house. Once the parents die, the children will have to pay for their housing themselves. Even if they inherit the house or apartment, they still have to bear the costs of ownership.

[[Housing in Japan|Japanese housing]] is compact, and is too small for two families. If freeters want to marry they have to find their own housing, usually at their own expense. 

===Difficulties starting a career===
Starting a career becomes more difficult the longer somebody is a freeter, as Japanese companies prefer to hire new workers fresh out of high school or university. While the employment situation is changing, large traditional companies still see a new employee as a lifetime investment.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} They much prefer to hire a young person who offers a longer period of service, and who will be easier to mold.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Often the only option left for freeters is to continue working at low income part-time jobs, making it difficult to establish their own household. Some join the many [[Homelessness|homeless]] in Japan.

===Health and pension insurance===
Part-time jobs usually do not include any health or retirement benefits. Freeters' low income makes payment of [[medical expenses]] onerous.

The biggest problem for freeters is that the Japanese pension system is based on the number of years a person has paid into the system. The freeter usually has little or no pension insurance or savings, which may force him or her to work beyond the usual retirement age. 

Japan faces the problem of an aging population. The pension system will be under increasing strain as the ratio of pensioners to workers increases.

===Freedom of choice===
The advantage of being a freeter is that one has more freedom of choice, and more time for hobbies, volunteering, and community service. If they are living with their parents, they can spend their entire income on themselves.

===Effect on Japanese society===
Freeters lack the benefits of union membership, which would give them some legal protection against firing.

While they are young, freeters commonly live with their parents and have [[disposable income]] that would otherwise go towards rent. Their spending helps the manufacturing sector of the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]].

By living in the same house as their parents and often not owning a car, freeters have a much lower impact on the natural environment than "high consumption" members of society owning cars.

Large numbers of workers trying to start careers in their thirties may have a significant impact on the current corporate culture of Japan. It may change hiring and employment practices, particularly since demographers predict a future labor shortage due to the nation's aging population.

Many male freeters have difficulties marrying because of their low income. They may thus have children later in life, or not at all. This will further inflame the low birth rate in Japan and compound social and economic problems related to the aging population, such as underfunding of the [[National Pension (Japan)|Japanese pension system]]. As of today, freeters pay little or no money into the pension system. The situation could become even worse in the future as more people become freeters, the ratio of workers to pensioners decreases, and the current pension policies around the world stay the same.

The Japanese government has established a number of offices called ''Young Support Plaza'' to help young people find jobs. These offices offer basic training for job hunting: teaching young people how to write a [[résumé]], and how to conduct themselves during interviews. The demand for their services has been fairly low so far.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8475">'''Frequent deliveries''' are a largely ignored but powerful way of leveling apparent demand within a supply chain and thereby reducing [[Mura (Japanese term)|Mura]]. What is perhaps not so obvious is that this will reduce inventory levels and thereby assist progress along the Lean journey at the same time. The historical focus upon carrying full loads, sometimes of only one product, reduces the unit cost of transport but has sometimes hidden the true costs associated with achieving those transport discounts. It is also possible to gain some of these benefits by 'faking' frequent deliveries at the supply site.&lt;ref&gt;The Gold Mine, F &amp; M Ballé, 2005, {{ISBN|0-9743225-6-3}}, p 210&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==

=== Reducing production lot size and raising delivery frequency ===

If we model this idea using a factory that produces three products (Triangles, Circles and Squares) and is making a regular daily delivery to its customer at the end of each day then we can represent this as below.

[[File:FreqDelivsLot4Deliv1.JPG|frame|center|138px|Original Situation]]

Stock builds up during the day until the factory has completed the production campaign of three products each of which is produced in a lot of four. After each lot of four a line-changeover happens, there are in fact three as we must include the one before the first production lot. Stock builds here to a maximum of twelve units. If the number of changeovers were doubled to six then the stock levels would remain the same same all the stock is still on site until the shipment.

The customer is receiving a mix of products that it is likely that they consume (or their in-stock equivalent) during, say, the next day. If the customer consumes the provided products during the day then their stock level will decrease by twelve over the day.

So if the customer will agree to receive half the daily shipment of each product halfway through the day and the second half at the original time of end of day and we reduce lot sizes by a factor of two the factory schedule would look like this.

[[File:FreqDelivsLot2Deliv2.JPG|frame|center|100px|Double the deliveries and halve the lot size]]

We now see that the benefits of the lot size reduction in the stock levels, both at the customer and at the supplying factory. Stock at both locations has been reduced by six. A possible downside for the factory is that it now has twice the changeovers (See [[Single-Minute Exchange of Die]] (SMED)).

If we take this to the extreme where the factory now has a changeover after every [[unit of production]] (single piece flow) and where shipments occur after every campaign (every product has been made) then the factory has this situation.

[[File:FreqDelivsLot1Deliv4.JPG|frame|center|100px|Single piece flow and ship every campaign]]

Now stock levels, again at the customer and supplier, are down to three from twelve. To achieve this cost effectively the changeovers must be very quick.

=== Just raising delivery frequency ===

So starting from the same original situation.

[[File:FreqDelivsLot4Deliv1.JPG|frame|center|138px|Original Situation]]

The factory chooses to just make the deliveries more frequent but not change production lot size, and to keep some extra stock so that deliveries can be exactly as in the model where lot sizes were changed as well.

[[File:FreqDelivsLot4Deliv2.JPG|frame|center|138px|Stock holding and more frequent deliveries]]

Here, although an extra stock of two is constantly being held it can be seen that the deliveries still reduce the holding by six giving a net benefit of four at the factory and six at the customer. This is without changing the production schedule.

If, again, this is taken to the extreme where deliveries are going to be made of one unit of each product and stock keeping adjusted to make this possible then this situation is seen.

[[File:FreqDelivsLot4Deliv4.JPG|frame|center|138px|Stock holding and most frequent deliveries]]

Here, although an extra stock of three is constantly being held it can be seen that the deliveries still reduce the holding by nine giving a net benefit of six at the factory and nine at the customer. This is still without changing the production schedule.

=== Summary ===

So from this example it can be seen that just increasing delivery frequency reduces the stock held in the system. This is no surprise to those in the context of station to station within a factory. It does seem to surprise many when used in the context of supplier to customer. The summary of this argument is in the table below.

{| class="wikitable" border="1" align=center style="text-align:center"
|+ Stock levels with different lot sizes and delivery frequencies
|-
!

! Two deliveries
! Four deliveries
|-

| 12 || 8 || 6
|-
! Lot size 2
| 12 || 6 || 4
|-
! Lot size 1
| 12 || 6 || 3
|}

== Implementation ==

So now the question is how to achieve this more frequent delivery. Well in fact many of the benefits within the factory can be achieved by 'faking' frequent deliveries while discussions with the customer about actual delivery frequencies takes place.

=== Faking frequent deliveries ===

The removal of items in the factory from the 'manufacturing system' will trigger the resupply that we wish to smooth via [[kanban]] or other signals. The frequent deliveries will provide a smoother sequence of smaller resupply signals. So by 'faking it' what is meant is that the actual delivery schedule will be de-coupled from the resupply triggers in the factory.

This can be done by marking a position on the floor, say a rectangular outline of perhaps the same size as the truck, in the loading bay and designating it to be a specific planned delivery or part of one. Let's call that outline a 'virtual truck'. Clearly if all the items for the delivery were now loaded into the virtual truck then the impact on demand signals into the factory would be the same as a real truck load. The secret here is to schedule a steady flow of items from the factory into the virtual truck so that demand appears as flat as possible. Obviously this may seem like 'smoke and mirrors' since the goods are still actually in the loading bay. The importance is that demand and supply are now decoupled. So whilst a real truck can still be loaded at the required speed, from the virtual truck, the signals for resupply passing via kanbans etc. back into the factory have created a smooth demand. This method can also be used to give early warning to the factory that it is falling behind the required schedule if it is to have all goods ready for shipment when the real truck arrives.

The downside of this trick is that there are now two movements of the goods, one to the virtual truck and one from it to the real truck.

=== Actual frequent deliveries ===

Since these need to meet agreement with the customer these will be less flexible than the 'virtual truck's' unless they are part of an internal process. Between 1982 and 1990 Toyota reorganised its service and crash parts business and as part of that it established Local Distribution Centres (LDCs) in each metropolitan centre.&lt;ref&gt;Womack, James P. and Jones, Daniel T. (1998), Lean Thinking Free Press, {{ISBN|0-7432-4927-5}}, p 85&lt;/ref&gt; It also encouraged dealers to work intensively with customers so that maintenance was scheduled sufficiently in advance that parts requirements could be precisely predicted.

Because the LDCs are so close to the dealers it was possible to establish a 'milk run' which visited every dealer every two hours. So when the service is booked a prelimiinary order is prepared for the required parts. The day before the scheduled service the customer is called to confirm the service and then a firm order to the LDC is placed for delivery on the next 'milk run'. Finally, when the car arrives for its service it is inspected and any other required parts ordered for delivery with 2–4 hours (the next run). This has resulted in very significant stock reductions throughout the system as the table below illustrates.

[[File:FBS Maximum.jpg|thumb|Simple function block diagram]]
The '''Function Block Diagram'''  ('''FBD''') is a graphical language for [[programmable logic controller]] design,&lt;ref&gt;R. W Lewis (2001) ''Modelling Distributed Control Systems Using IEC 61499''. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; that can describe the function between input variables and output variables. A function is described as a set of elementary blocks. Input and output variables are connected to blocks by connection lines.

Inputs and outputs of the blocks are wired together with connection lines, or links. Single lines may be used to connect two logical points of the diagram:
* An input variable and an input of a block
* An output of a block and an input of another block
* An output of a block and an output variable

The connection is oriented, meaning that the line carries associated data from the left end to the right end.  The left and right ends of the connection line must be of the same type.

Multiple right connection, also called divergence can be used to broadcast information from its left end to each of its right ends.  All ends of the connection must be of the same type.

Function Block Diagram is one of five languages for [[logic]] or [[Control theory|control]] [[computer configuration|configuration]]&lt;ref&gt;W. Bolton (2011) ''Programmable Logic Controllers''. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; supported by [[standardization|standard]] [[IEC 61131-3]] for a [[control system]] such as a [[Programmable Logic Controller]] (PLC) or a [[Distributed Control System]] (DCS).  The other supported languages are [[ladder logic]], [[sequential function chart]], [[structured text]], and [[instruction list]].

A '''gravity tractor''' is a theoretical [[spacecraft]] that would deflect another object in space, typically a [[potentially hazardous object|potentially hazardous asteroid]] that might impact Earth, without physically contacting it, using only its [[gravitational field]] to transmit the required [[impulse (physics)|impulse]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward T. Lu and Stanley G. Love (10 November 2005), [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7065/abs/438177a.html Gravitational tractor for towing asteroids], ''Nature'' '''438''':177–178, {{doi|10.1038/438177a}}. Also, see [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0509595 astro-ph/0509595] in the [[ArXiv.org e-print archive|arXiv]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yeomans, D.K. et al. (2005) [http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/acm2008/pdf/8273.pdf Using a Gravity Tractor to Help Mitigate Asteroid Collisions with Earth]&lt;/ref&gt;  The gravitational force of a nearby space vehicle, though minuscule, is able to alter the trajectory of a much larger asteroid if the vehicle spends enough time close to it; all that is required is that the vehicle thrust in a consistent direction relative to the asteroid's trajectory, and that neither the vehicle nor its expelled reaction mass come in direct contact with the asteroid.  The tractor spacecraft could either hover near the object being deflected, or orbit it, directing its exhaust perpendicular to the plane of the orbit. The concept has two key advantages: namely that essentially nothing needs to be known about the mechanical composition and structure of the asteroid in advance; and that the relatively small amounts of force used enable extremely precise manipulation and determination of the asteroid's orbit around the [[sun]].  Whereas other methods of deflection would require the determination of the asteroid's exact center of mass, and considerable effort might be necessary to halt its spin or rotation, by using the tractor method these considerations are irrelevant.

==Advantages==
A number of considerations arise concerning means for avoiding a devastating collision with an asteroidal object, should one be discovered on a trajectory that were determined to lead to Earth impact at some future date.  One of the main challenges is how to transmit the [[impulse (physics)|impulse]] required (possibly quite large), to an asteroid of unknown mass, composition, and mechanical strength, without shattering it into fragments, some of which might be themselves dangerous to Earth if left in a collision orbit.
The gravity tractor solves this problem by gently accelerating the object as a whole over an extended period of time, using the spacecraft's own mass and associated gravitational field to effect the necessary deflecting force.
Because of the [[Universal gravitation|universality of gravitation]], affecting as it does all mass alike, the asteroid would be accelerated almost uniformly as a whole, with only [[tidal force]]s (which should be extremely small) causing any stresses to its internal structure.

A further advantage is that a [[transponder]] on the spacecraft, by continuously monitoring the position and velocity of the tractor/asteroid system, could enable the post-deflection trajectory of the asteroid to be accurately known, ensuring its final placement into a safe orbit.&lt;ref&gt;''Threat Mitigation: The Gravity Tractor''&amp;nbsp; (2006) Schweickart, Russell; Chapman, Clark; Durda, Dan; Hut, Piet, Submitted to NASA Workshop on Near-Earth Objects, Vail, Colorado, June 2006 [arXiv:physics/0608157.pdf], available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0608157]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Limitations of the tractor concept include the exhaust configuration. With the most efficient hovering design (that is, pointing the exhaust directly at the target object for maximum force per unit of fuel), the expelled reaction mass hits the target head-on, imparting a force in exactly the opposite direction to the gravitational pull of the tractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = New Scientist: Letter to editor re: gravity tractor article, with author response|url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19526151.400-asteroid-deflection.html |date = 2007-08-04 |accessdate = 2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would therefore be necessary to use the orbiting-tractor scheme described below, or else design the hovering tractor so that its exhaust is directed at a slight angle away from the object, while still pointing "down" enough to keep a steady hover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/b612_report.html |title= NEAR-EARTH OBJECT (NEO) ANALYSIS OF TRANSPONDER TRACKING AND GRAVITY TRACTOR PERFORMANCE |author= [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] |author2= D.K. Yeomans |author3=S. Bhaskaran |author4=S.B. Broschart |author5=S.R. Chesley |author6=P.W. Chodas |author7=M.A. Jones |author8=T.H. Sweetser |date= September 22, 2008 |publisher= [[B612 Foundation]] |pages= 17–22 |format= Microsoft Word (.doc) |accessdate= April 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires greater thrust and correspondingly increased fuel consumption for each [[Metre per second|metre per second]] change in the target's velocity.

Issues of the effect of [[ion propulsion]] thrust on the dust of asteroids have been raised, suggesting that alternative means to control the [[orbital stationkeeping|station keeping]] position of the gravity tractor may need to be considered. In this respect, [[solar sail]]s have been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=22765 The Asteroid and the Telescope], Paul Gilster, Centauri Dreams News, 2012-05-03, accessed 2012-05-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Rusty Schweickart]], the gravitational tractor method is also controversial because during the process of changing an asteroid's trajectory the point on Earth where it could most likely hit would be slowly shifted across different countries. It means that the threat for the entire planet would be minimized at the cost of some specific states' security. In Schweickart's opinion, choosing the way the asteroid should be "dragged" would be a tough diplomatic decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/12/saving-earth-from-an-asteroid/ | title=Saving Earth From an Asteroid Will Take Diplomats, Not Heroes | last=Madrigal | first=Alexis | date=16 December 2009 | publisher=[[WIRED]] | accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
To get a feel for the magnitude of these issues, let us suppose that a [[Near-Earth object|NEO]] of size around 100 m, and mass of one million metric tons, threatened to impact Earth.  Suppose also that

* a velocity correction of 1&amp;nbsp;centimetre per second would be adequate to place it in a safe and stable orbit, missing Earth
* that the correction needed to be applied within a period of 10 years.

With these parameters, the required impulse would be: ''V''&amp;nbsp;× ''M''&amp;nbsp; = 0.01 [m/s]×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; [kg] = 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; [N-s], so that the average tractor force on the asteroid for 10 years (which is 3.156×10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; seconds), would need to be about 0.032 [[Newton (unit)|newtons]].
An ion-electric spacecraft with a specific impulse of 10,000 N-s per kg, corresponding to an ion beam velocity of 10&amp;nbsp;kilometres per second (about 20 times that obtained with the best chemical rockets), would require 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg of reaction mass ([[xenon]] is currently favored) to provide the impulse.
The kinetic power of the ion beam would then be approximately 158 watts; the input electric power to the power converter and ion drive would of course be substantially higher.
The spacecraft would need to have enough mass and remain sufficiently close to the asteroid that the component of the average gravitational force on the asteroid in the desired direction would equal or exceed the required 0.032 newtons.
Assuming the spacecraft is hovering over the asteroid at a distance of 200 m to its centre of mass, that would
require it to have a mass of about 20 metric tonnes, because due to the [[gravitational force]] we
have

&lt;math&gt;
m_2 = \frac{F r^2}{G m_1}
=\frac{0.032[N] \times (200[m])^2}{6.674 \times 10^{-11} [N m^2 kg^{-2}] \times 10^9 [kg]}
\approx 19200 kg
&lt;/math&gt;

Considering possible hovering positions or orbits of the tractor around the asteroid, note that if two objects are gravitationally bound in a mutual orbit, then if one receives an arbitrary impulse which is less than that needed to free it from orbit around the other, because of the gravitational forces between them, the impulse will alter the momentum of both, together regarded as a composite system.
That is, so long as the tractor remains in a bound orbit, any propulsive force applied to it will be effectively transferred to the asteroid it orbits.
This permits a wide variety of orbits or hovering strategies for the tractor.
One obvious possibility is for the spacecraft to orbit the NEO with [[Normal (geometry)|the normal]] to the orbit in the direction of the desired force.
The ion beam would then be directed in the opposite direction, also perpendicular to the orbit plane.  This would result in the plane of the orbit being shifted somewhat away from the center of the asteroid, "towing" it, while the orbital velocity, normal to the thrust, remains constant.  The orbital period would be a few hours, essentially independent of size, but weakly dependent on the density of the target body.

A {{nihongo|'''''kōan'''''|公案}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|.|ɑː|n}}; {{zh|c=公案|p=gōng'àn}}, {{IPAc-cmn|g|ong|1|-|an|4}}; {{lang-ko|공안}} ''gong-an''; {{lang-vi|công án}}) is a [[narrative|story]], [[dialogue]], question, or statement which is used in [[Zen]] practice to provoke the "great doubt" and test a student's progress in Zen practice.

==Etymology==
The Japanese term ''kōan'' is the [[on'yomi|Sino-Japanese reading]] of the Chinese word ''gong'an'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:公案|公案]]|p=gōng'àn|w=''kung-an''|l=public case}}). The term is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] word, consisting of the [[Chinese character|characters]] {{lang|zh|[[wikt:公|公]]}} "public; official; governmental; common; collective; fair; equitable" and {{lang|zh|[[wikt:案|案]]}} "table; desk; (law) case; record; file; plan; proposal."

According to the [[Yuan Dynasty]] Zen master [[Zhongfeng Mingben]] ({{lang|zh|中峰明本}} 1263–1323), ''gōng'àn'' originated as an abbreviation of ''gōngfǔ zhī àndú'' ({{lang|zh|公府之案牘}}, Japanese ''kōfu no antoku''—literally the ''andu'' "official correspondence; documents; files" of a ''gongfu'' "government post"), which referred to a "public record" or the "case records of a public law court" in [[Tang dynasty|Tang-dynasty]] China.{{sfn|Sasaki|1965|p=4-6}}{{sfn|Foulk|2000|p=21-22}}{{refn|group=note|Assertions that the literal meaning of ''kung-an'' is the table, desk, or bench of a magistrate appear on page 18 of Foulk 2000. See also {{sfn|McRae|2003|p=172–173, note 16}}}} ''Kōan/gong'an'' thus serves as a [[metaphor]] for principles of reality beyond the private opinion of one person, and a teacher may test the student's ability to recognize and understand that principle.

Commentaries in kōan collections bear some similarity to judicial decisions that cite and sometimes modify precedents. An article by T. Griffith Foulk claims
{{quote|...Its literal meaning is the 'table' or 'bench' ''[[An (Shintō)|an]]'' of a 'magistrate' or 'judge' ''[[gong (title)|kung]]''.{{sfn|Foulk|2000|p=21–22}}}}

''Gong'an'' was itself originally a metonym—an article of furniture involved in setting legal precedents came to stand for such precedents. For example, ''Di Gong'an'' ({{lang|zh|狄公案}}) is the original title of ''[[Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee]]'', the famous Chinese [[detective novel]] based on a historical Tang dynasty judge. Similarly, Zen kōan collections are public records of the notable sayings and actions of Zen masters and disciples attempting to pass on their teachings.

==Origins and development==

===China===

====Commenting on old cases====
Gong'ans developed during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907){{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=111}} from the recorded sayings collections of Chán-masters, which quoted many stories of "a famous past Chán figure's encounter with disciples or other interlocutors and then offering his own comment on it".{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=109}} Those stories and the accompanying comments were used to educate students, and broaden their insight into the Buddhist teachings.

Those stories came to be known as gongan, "public cases".{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=109}} Such a story was only considered a gongan when it was commented upon by another Chán-master.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=109}} This practice of commenting on the words and deeds of past masters confirmed the master's position as an awakened master in a lineage of awakened masters of the past.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=1109}}

====Literary practice====
Koan practice developed from a literary practice, styling snippets of encounter-dialogue into well-edited stories. It arose in interaction with "educated literati".{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=131}} There were dangers involved in such a literary approach, such as ascribing specific meanings to the cases.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=131}} Dahui Zonggao is even said to have burned the woodblocks of the ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]'', for the hindrance it had become to study of Chán by his students.{{sfn|Yampolski|2003a|p=20}} Kōan literature was also influenced by the pre-Zen Chinese tradition of the "literary game"—a competition involving improvised poetry.{{sfn|Hori|2003|p=Chapter 4}}

The style of writing of Zen texts has been influenced by "a variety of east Asian literary games":{{sfn|Heine|2008|p=52}}
{{quote|
#The extensive use of [[allusion]]s, which create a feeling of disconnection with the main theme;
#Indirect references, such as titling a poem with one topic and composing a verse that seems on the surface to be totally unrelated;
#Inventive wordplay based on the fact that [[Hanzi]] (Chinese characters) are homophonic and convey multiple, often complementary or contradictory meanings;
#Linking the verses in a sustained string based on hidden points of connection or continuity, such as seasonal imagery or references to myths and legends.{{sfn|Heine|2008|p=52}}}}

====Observing the phrase====
During the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1297) the use of gongans took a decisive turn. [[Dahui Zonggao]] (1089–1163){{refn|group=note|{{lang|zh|大慧宗杲}}; Wade-Giles: ''Ta-hui Tsung-kao''; Japanese: ''Daie Sōkō''}} introduced the use of ''kanhua'', "observing the phrase". In this practice students were to observe (''kan'') or concentrate on a single word or phrase (''huatou''), such as the famous ''mu'' of the [[Mu (negative)|mu-koan]].{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=22}}

In the eleventh century this practice had become common.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=111}} A new literary genre developed from this tradition as well. Collections of such commented cases were compiled which consisted of the case itself, accompanied by verse or prose commentary.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=110}}

Dahui's invention was aimed at balancing the [[Vipassana|insight]] developed by reflection on the teachings with developing [[samatha]], calmness of mind.{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=23}} Ironically, this development became in effect ''silent illumination'',{{sfn|Wright|2000|p=208}} a "[re-absorbing] of koan-study into the "silence" of meditation (''ch'an'')".{{sfn|Wright|2000|p=209}} It led to a rejection of Buddhist learning:
{{quote|Some extent of Buddhist learning could easily have been recognized as a precondition for [[Subitism|sudden awakening]] in Chan. Sung masters, however, tended to take the rejection literally and nondialectically. In effect, what they instituted was a form of Zen fundamentalism: the tradition came to be increasingly anti-intellectual in orientation and, in the process, reduced its complex heritage to simple formulae for which literal interpretations were thought adequate.{{sfn|Wright|2000|p=209–210}}}}

This development left Chinese Chan vulnerable to criticisms by neo-Confucianism, which developed after the Sung Dynasty. Its anti-intellectual rhetoric was no match for the intellectual discourse of the neo-Confucianists.{{sfn|Wright|2000|p=210–211}}

====Interaction====
The recorded encounter dialogues, and the koan collections which derived from this genre, mark a shift from solitary practice to interaction between master and student:
{{quote|The essence of [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] came to be identified with the interaction between masters and students. Whatever insight [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]] might bring, its verification was always interpersonal. In effect, enlightenment came to be understood not so much as an insight, but as a way of acting in the world with other people{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=30}}}}

This mutual enquiry of the meaning of the encounters of masters and students of the past gave students a role model:
{{quote|One looked at the enlightened activities of one's lineal forebears in order to understand one's own identity [...] taking the role of the participants and engaging in their dialogues instead{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=130}}{{refn|group=note|This role-taking is described by the Swedish psychologist of religion [[Hjalmar Sundén]], though McRae does not seem to be aware of this}}}}

Kōan training requires a qualified teacher who has the ability to judge a disciple's depth of attainment. In the [[Rinzai school|Rinzai Zen school]], which uses kōans extensively, the teacher certification process includes an appraisal of proficiency in using that school's extensive kōan curriculum.

====Contemporary koan-use====
In China and Korea, "observing the phrase" is still the sole form of koan-practice, though [[Seung Sahn]] used the Rinzai-style of koan-practice in his [[Kwan Um School of Zen]].{{sfn|Lachs|2012}}

===Japan===
Japanese Zen, both Rinzai and [[Sōtō]], took over the use of koan-study and commenting. In Sōtō-Zen, koan commentary was not linked to seated meditation.{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=25}}

====Koan manuals====
When the Chán-tradition was introduced in Japan, Japanese monks had to master the Chinese language and specific expressions used in the koan-training. The desired "spontaneity" expressed by enlightened masters required a thorough study of Chinese language and poetry.{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=92–93}} Japanese Zen imitated the Chinese "syntax and stereotyped norms".{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=93}}

In the officially recognized monasteries belonging to the [[Five Mountain System|Gozan]] (Five Mountain System) the Chinese system was fully continued. Senior monks were supposed to compose Chinese verse in a complex style of matched counterpoints known as ''bienli wen''. It took a lot of literary and intellectual skills for a monk to succeed in this system.{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=94}}

The [[Five Mountain System#The Rinka|Rinka-monasteries]], the provincial temples with less control of the state, laid less stress on the correct command of the Chinese cultural idiom. These monasteries developed "more accessible methods of koan instruction".{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=94}} It had three features:{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=94}}
#A standardized koan-curriculum;
#A standardized set of answers based on stereotypes Chinese sayings;
#A standardized method of secretly guiding students through the curriculum of koan and answers.

By standardizing the koan-curriculum every generation of students proceeded to the same series of koans.{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=94}} Students had to memorize a set number of stereotyped sayings, ''agyō'', "appended words".{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=96–97}} The proper series of responses for each koan were taught by the master in private instruction-sessions to selected individual students who would inherit the dharma lineage.{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=97–98}}

''Missanroku'' and ''missanchō'', "Records of secret instruction" have been preserved for various Rinzai-lineages. They contain both the koan-curricula and the standardized answers.{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=98}}{{refn|group=note|In 1916 Tominaga Shūho, using the pseudonym "Hau Hōō", published a critique of the Rinzai koan-system, ''Gendai sōjizen no hyōron'', which also contained a translation of a ''missanroku''. The missanroku part has been translated by [[Yoel Hoffmann]] as ''"The Sound of the One Hand"'' (see {{sfn|Hoffmann|1975}}).{{sfn|Bodiford|1993|p=264, note 29}}}} In Sōtō-Zen they are called ''monsan'', an abbreviation of ''monto hissan'', "secret instructions of the lineage".{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=98}} The ''monsan'' follow a standard question-and-answer format. A series of questions is given, to be asked by the master. The answers are also given by the master, to be memorized by the student.{{sfn|Bodiford|2006|p=102–106}}

====Contemporary koan curricula====
In the eighteenth century the Rinzai school became dominated by the legacy of [[Hakuin]], who laid a strong emphasis on koan study as a means to gain [[kensho]] and develop insight.{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=25}} There are two curricula used in Rinzai, both derived from the principal heirs of Rinzai: the Takuju curriculum, and the Inzan curriculum.{{sfn|Hori|2000}} According to [[Ama Samy|AMA Samy]], "the koans and their standard answers are fixed."{{sfn|Samy|p=4}}

====Suppression in the Sōtō-school====
During the late eighteenth and nineteenth century the tradition of koan-commentary became suppressed in the Sōtō-school, due to a reform movement that sought to standardise the procedures for [[dharma transmission]].{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=25}} One reason for suppressing the koan-tradition in the Sōtō-school may have been to highlight the differences with the Rinzai-school, and create a clear identity.{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=25}} This movement also started to venerate [[Dogen]] as the founding teacher of the Sōtō-school. His teachings became the standard for the Sōtō-teachings, neglecting the fact that Dogen himself made extensive use of koan-commentary.{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=25}}

==Doctrinal background==
The popular western understanding sees ''kōan'' as referring to an unanswerable question or a [[meaningless statement]]. However, in Zen practice, a kōan is not meaningless, and not a riddle or a puzzle. Teachers do expect students to present an appropriate response when asked about a kōan.{{sfn|Sasaki|1965|p=xi}}{{sfn|Hagen|2000}}{{sfn|Aitken|1991|p=xiii, 26, and 212}} {{sfn|Loori|1994|p=p64}}

Koans are also understood as pointers to an unmediated "Pure Consciousness", devoid of cognitive activity.{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=282}} Victor Hori criticizes this understanding:
{{quote|[A] pure consciousness without concepts, if there could be such a thing, would be a booming, buzzing confusion, a sensory field of flashes of light, unidentifiable sounds, ambiguous shapes, color patches without significance. This is not the consciousness of the enlightened Zen master.{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=284}}}}

According to Hori, a central theme of many koans is the 'identity of opposites':{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=289-290}}{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=310 note 14}}
{{quote|[K]oan after koan explores the theme of nonduality. Hakuin's well-known koan, "Two hands clap and there is a sound, what is the sound of one hand?" is clearly about two and one. The koan asks, you know what duality is, now what is nonduality? In "What is your [[original face]] before your mother and father were born?" the phrase "father and mother" alludes to duality. This is obvious to someone versed in the Chinese tradition, where so much philosophical thought is presented in the imagery of paired opposites. The phrase "your original face" alludes to the original nonduality.{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=289-290}}}}

Comparable statements are: "Look at the flower and the flower also looks"; "Guest and host interchange".{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=289}}

==Koan-practice==
Study of kōan literature is common to all schools of Zen, though with varying emphases and curricula.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=35-43}} The Rinzai-school uses extensive koan-curricula, checking questions, and ''jakogo'' ("capping phrases", quotations from Chinese poetry) in its use of koans.{{sfn|Hori|2006}} The [[Sanbo Kyodan]], and its western derivates of [[Taizan Maezumi]] and the [[White Plum Asanga]], also use koan-curricula, but have omitted the use of capping phrases.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=35-43}} In [[Chinese Chán]] and Korean Seon, the emphasis is on [[Hua Tou]], the study of one koan throughout one's lifetime.{{sfn|Lachs|2012}} In Japanese Sōtō-Zen, the use of koans has been abandoned since the late eighteenth and nineteenth century.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=245}}

===Hua-tou or breakthrough-koan===
In the Rinzai-school, the Sanbo Kyodan, and the White Plum Asanga, koan practice starts with the assignment of a ''hosshi'' or "break-through koan", usually the [[Mu (negative)#The Mu-koan|mu-koan]] or "the sound of one hand clapping".{{sfn|Hori|2000}} In Chinese Chán and Korean Seon, various koan can be used for the hua-tou practice.

Students are instructed to concentrate on the "word-head", like the phrase "mu". In the Wumenguan (Mumonkan), public case #1 ("Zhaozhou's Dog"), Wumen (Mumon) wrote:
{{quote|... concentrate yourself into this 'Wú' ... making your whole body one great inquiry. Day and night work intently at it. Do not attempt nihilistic or dualistic interpretations."{{sfn|Shibayama|1974}}}}

Arousing this great inquiry or "Great Doubt" is an essential element of kōan practice. It builds up "strong internal pressure (''gidan''), never stopping knocking from within at the door of [the] mind, demanding to be resolved".{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=138–139}} To illustrate the enormous concentration required in kōan meditation, Zen Master Wumen commented,
{{quote|It is like swallowing a red-hot iron ball. You try to vomit it out, but you can't.}}

Analysing the koan for its literal meaning won't lead to insight, though understanding the context from which koans emerged can make them more intelligible. For example, when a monk asked Zhaozhou (Joshu) "does a dog have Buddha-nature or not?", the monk was referring to the understanding of the teachings on [[Buddha-nature]], which were understood in the Chinese context of absolute and relative reality.{{sfn|Shibayama|1974|p=Commentary on case #1}}{{sfn|Swanson|1997}}{{refn|group=note|The controversy over whether all beings have the potential for enlightenment is even older. Vigorous controversy still surrounds the matter of Buddha nature. See "Tao-sheng's Theory of Sudden Enlightenment", Whalen Lai, in ''Sudden and Gradual'' (subtitle) ''Approaches to Enlightenment in Chinese Thought'', p. 173 and 191. The latter page documents how in 429 or thereabouts (more than 400&amp;nbsp;years before Zhaozhou), Tao-sheng was expelled from the Buddhist monastic community for defending the idea that incorrigible persons (''icchantika'') do indeed have Buddha-nature (''fo-hsing'').}}

===Insight===
The continuous pondering of the break-through koan (''shokan''{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=132}}) or [[Hua Tou]], "word head",{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=38}} leads to [[kensho]], an initial insight into "seeing the [[Buddha-nature|(Buddha-)nature]].{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=287}}

The aim of the break-through koan is to see the "nonduality of subject and object":{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=289-290}}{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=310 note 14}}
{{quote|The monk himself in his seeking is the koan. Realization of this is the insight; the response to the koan [...] Subject and object - this is two hands clapping. When the monk realizes that the koan is not merely an object of consciousness but is also he himself as the activity of seeking an answer to the koan, then subject and object are no longer separate and distinct [...] This is one hand clapping.{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=288-289}}}}

Various accounts can be found which describe this "becoming one" and the resulting breakthrough:
{{quote|I was dead tired. That evening when I tried to settle down to sleep, the instant I laid my head on the pillow, I saw: "Ah, this outbreath is Mu!" Then: the in-breath too is Mu!" Next breath, too: Mu! Next breath: Mu, Mu! "Mu, a whole sequence of Mu! Croak, croak; meow, meow - these too are Mu! The bedding, the wall, the column, the sliding-door - these too are Mu! This, that and everything is Mu! Ha ha! Ha ha ha ha Ha! that roshi is a rascal! He's always tricking people with his 'Mu, Mu, Mu'!...{{sfn|Satomi|King|1993|p=106}}{{refn|group=note|Maura O'Halloran also gives an account of herself becoming mu.{{sfn|O'Halloran|2007|p=78}}}}}}

But the use of the mu-koan has also been criticised. According to [[Ama Samy|AMA Samy]], the main aim is merely to "'become one' with the koan".{{sfn|Samy|p=5}} Showing to have 'become one' with the first koan is enough to pass the first koan.{{sfn|Samy|p=5}} According to Samy, this is not equal to [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]:
{{quote|The one-pointed, non-intellectual concentration on the hua-t’ou (or Mu) is a pressure-cooker tactics, a reduction to a technique which can produce some psychic experiences. These methods and techniques are forced efforts which can even run on auto-pilot. They can produce experiences but not prajana wisdom. Some speak of ‘investigating’ the hua-t’ou, but it is rather a matter of concentration, which sometimes can provide insights, yet no more than that.{{sfn|Samy|p=5}}}}

===Testing insight - or learning responses===

====Sassho – Checking questions====
Teachers may probe students about their kōan practice using ''sassho'', "checking questions" to validate their [[satori]] (understanding) or [[kenshō|kensho]] (seeing the nature).{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=132–133}} For the ''mu-koan'' and the ''clapping hand-koan'' there are twenty to a hundred checking questions, depending on the teaching lineage.{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=133}} The checking questions serve to deepen the insight of the student, but also to test his or her understanding.{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=133}}

Those checking questions, and their answers, are part of a standardised set of questions and answers.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1975}}{{sfn|Stephenson|2005}}{{sfn|Samy|p=5}} Students are learning a "ritual performance",{{sfn|Stephenson|2005}} learning how to behave and response in specific ways,{{sfn|Hoffmann|1975}}{{sfn|Stephenson|2005}}{{sfn|Samy|p=5}} learning "clever repartees, ritualized language and gestures and be submissive to the master’s diktat and arbitration."{{sfn|Samy|p=5}}

====Jakugo – Capping phrases====
In the Rinzai-school, passing a koan and the checking questions has to be supplemented by ''[[jakugo]]'', "capping phrases", citations of Chinese poetry to demonstrate the insight.{{sfn|Hori|1999}}{{sfn|Hori|2003}} Students can use collections of those citations, instead of composing poetry themselves.{{sfn|Hori|1999}}{{sfn|Hori|2003}}

===Post-satori practice===
After the initial insight [[Kenshō#Training after kenshō|further practice]] is necessary, to deepen the insight and learn to express it in daily life.{{sfn|Sekida|1996}} In Chinese Chán and Korean Seon, this further practice consists of further pondering of the same Hua Tou.&lt;ref group=web name="Lachs" /&gt; In Rinzai-Zen, this further practice is undertaken by further koan-study, for which elaborate curriculae exist.{{sfn|Hori|2000}}{{sfn|Hori|2005b}} In Sōtō-Zen, [[Shikantaza]] is the main practice for deepening insight.

==Varieties in koan-practice==

===Chinese Chán and Korean Seon===
{{Main|Hua Tou}}

In Chinese Chán and Korean Seon, the primary form of Koan-study is ''kanhua'', "reflection on the koan",{{sfn|Schlütter|2000|p=168}} also called [[Hua Tou]], "word head".{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=38}} In this practice, a fragment of the koan, such as "''mu''", or a "what is"-question is used by focusing on this fragment and repeating it over and over again:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.dharmanet.org/samples/chansample2.htm Dharmanet, ''Huatou'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lachs|2012}}
{{quote|Who is it who now repeats the Buddha's name?&lt;br&gt;
Who is dragging this corpse about?&lt;br&gt;
What is this?&lt;br&gt;
What is it?&lt;br&gt;
What was the original face before my father and mother were born?&lt;br&gt;
Who am I?&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.hsuyun.org/chan/en/essays/bychuanzhi/759-huatoupractice.html hsuyun.org, ''The Hua-Tou Practice'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The student is assigned only one hua-tou for a lifetime.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=38}} In contrast to the similar-sounding "who am I?" question of [[Ramana Maharshi]], hua-tou involves raising "great doubt":&lt;ref group=web name="Lachs"&gt;[http://www.nondualitymagazine.org/nonduality_magazine.2.stuartlachs.interview.htm Nonduality Magazine (2010), ''Interview with Stuart Lachs'']&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|This koan becomes a touchstone of our practice: it is a place to put our doubt, to cultivate great doubt, to allow the revelation of great faith, and to focus our great energy.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=38}}}}

===Japanese Rinzai===
Kōan practice is particularly important among Japanese practitioners of the Rinzai sect.

====Importance of koan-study====
This importance is reflected in writings in the Rinzai-school on the koan-genre. [[Zhongfeng Mingben]]{{efn|group=note|{{lang|zh|中峰明本}}, Wade Giles: ''Chung-feng Ming-pen''; Japanese ''Chūhō Myōhon''}} (1263–1323),{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=155}} a Chinese [[Chinese Chán|Chán-master]] who lived at the beginning of the [[Yuan Dynasty]], revitalized the Rinzai-tradition,{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}} and put a strong emphasis on the use of koans. He saw the kung-ans as "work of literature [that] should be used as objective, universal standards to test the insight of monks who aspired to be recognized as Ch'an masters":{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=22}}
{{quote|The koans do not represent the private opinion of a single man, but rather the hundreds and thousands of [[bodhisattva]]s of the [[Trailokya|three realms]] and [[Ten spiritual realms|ten directions]]. This principle accords with the spiritual source, tallies with the mysterious meaning, destroys birth-and-death, and transcends the passions. It cannot be understood by logic; it cannot be transmitted in words; it cannot be explained in writing; it cannot be measured by reason. It is like the poisoned drum that kills all who hear it, or like a great fire that consumes all who come near it. What is called "the special transmission of the Vulture Peak" was the transmission of this; what is called the "direct pointing of [[Bodhidharma]] at Shao-lin-ssu" is this.{{sfn|Mingben|2006|p=13}}}}

[[Musō Soseki]] (1275–1351), a Japanese contemporary of Zhongfeng Mingben, relativized the use of koans.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=164–165}} The study of koans had become popular in Japan, due to the influence of Chinese masters such as Zhongfeng Mingben. Despite belonging to the Rinzai-school, Musō Soseki also made extensive use of ''richi'' (teaching), explaining the sutras, instead of ''kikan'' (koan). According to Musō Soseki, both are ''upaya'', "skillful means" meant to educate students.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=164–165}} Musō Soseki called both ''shōkogyu'', "little jewels", tools to help the student to attain [[satori]].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=164–165}}{{refn|group=note|The term ''shōkogyu'' comes from a Chinese poem in which a lady calls the attendant using the word ''xiaoyu'', Jap. ''shōkogyu'', to warn her lover.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=165}} The poem figures in an interaction between [[Wuzi Fayan]] (1024–1104) and his student [[Yuanwu Keqin]], the teacher of [[Dahui Zonggao]]. Yüan-wu was assigned the koan "The verbal and the nonverbal are like vines clinging to a tree". Yuanwu gained [[satori]] with the phrase "She keeps calling out to [her maid] ''Xiaoyu'' although there is nothing the matter.{{sfn|Schlütter|2000|p=186}} It is only because she knows Tanlang [her lover] will hear her voice".{{sfn|Schlütter|2000|p=198 note 96}} The same koan was assigned to Dahui Zonggao.{{sfn|Schlütter|2000|p=197 note 94}}}}

====Koan curricula====
In Rinzai a gradual succession of koans is studied.{{sfn|Besserman|Steger|2011|p=148}} There are two general branches of curricula used within Rinzai, derived from the principal heirs of Rinzai: the Takuju curriculum, and the Inzan curriculum.  However, there are a number of sub-branches of these, and additional variations of curriculum often exist between individual teaching lines which can reflect the recorded experiences of a particular lineage's members.  Koan curricula are, in fact, subject to continued accretion and evolution over time, and thus are best considered living traditions of practice rather than set programs of study.

Koan practice starts with the ''shokan'', or "first barrier", usually the mu-koan or the koan "What is the sound of one hand clapping?"{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=132}} After having attained ''kensho'', students continue their practice investigating subsequent koans.{{sfn|Yampolski|2005|p=186}} In the Takuju-school, after breakthrough students work through the ''Gateless Gate'' (Mumonkan), the ''Blue Cliff Record'' (Hekigan-roku), the ''Entangling Vines'' (Shumon Kattoshu), and the ''Collection of Wings of the Blackbird'' ({{lang|ja|鴆羽集}}, ''Chin'u shū'').{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=42}} The Inzan-school uses its own internally generated list of koans.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=42}}

Hakuin's descendants developed a fivefold classification system:{{sfn|Besserman|Steger|2011|p=148}}
#''Hosshin'', dharma-body koans, are used to awaken the first insight into [[sunyata]].{{sfn|Besserman|Steger|2011|p=148}} They reveal the [[dharmakaya]], or Fundamental.{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=136}} They introduce "the undifferentitated and the unconditional".{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=136–137}}
#''Kikan'', dynamic action koans, help to understand the phenomenal world as seen from the awakened point of view;{{sfn|Besserman|Steger|2011|p=148-149}} Where ''hosshin'' koans represent ''tai'', substance, ''kikan'' koans represent ''yu'', function.{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=137}}
#''Gonsen'', explication of word koans, aid to the understanding of the recorded sayings of the old masters.{{sfn|Besserman|Steger|2011|p=149}} They show how the Fundamental, though not depending on words, is nevertheless expressed in words, without getting stuck to words.{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=138}}
#''Hachi Nanto'', eight "difficult to pass" koans.{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=135}} There are various explanations for this category, one being that these koans cut off clinging to the previous attainment. They create another Great Doubt, which shatters the self attained through ''satori''.{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=139}} It is uncertain which are exactly those eight koans.{{sfn|Hori|2003|p=23}} Hori gives various sources, which altogether give ten ''hachi nanto'' koans:{{sfn|Hori|2003|p=23-24}}
#*Miura and Sasaki:
#**Nansen's Flower (Hekigan-roku Case 40)
#**A Buffalo Passes the Window (Mumonkan Case 38)
#**Sōzan's Memorial Tower (Kattō-shō Case 140)
#**Suigan's Eyebrows (Hekigan-roku Case 8)
#**Enkan's Rhinoceros Fan (Hekigan-roku Case 91)
#*Shimano:
#**The Old Woman Burns the Hut (Kattō-shō Case 162)
#*Asahina Sōgen:
#**Goso Hōen's "Hakuun Said 'Not Yet'" (Kattō-shō Case 269)
#**Shuzan's Main Cable (Kattō-shō Case 280).
#*Akizuki:
#**Nansen Has Died (Kattō-shō Case 282)
#**Kenpō’s Three Illnesses (Kattō-shō Case 17).
#''Goi jujukin'' koans, the [[Five Ranks|Five Ranks of Tozan]] and the Ten Grave Precepts.{{sfn|Besserman|Steger|2011|p=151}}{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=135}}

According to [[Akizuki Ryomin|Akizuki]] there was an older classification-system, in which the fifth category was ''Kojo'', "Directed upwards". This category too was meant to rid the monk of any "stink of Zen".{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=143}} The very advanced practitioner may also receive the ''Matsugo no rokan'', "The last barrier, and ''Saigo no ikketsu'', "The final confirmation".{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=143}} "The last barrier" when one left the training hall, for example "Sum up all of the records of Rinzai in one word!"{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=143}} It is not meant to be solved immediately, but to be carried around in order to keep practising.{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=143}} "the final confirmation" may be another word for the same kind of koan.{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=143}}

====Post-satori practice====
Completing the koan-curriculum in the Rinzai-schools traditionally also led to a mastery of Chinese poetry and literary skills:
{{quote|[D]isciples today are expected to spend a dozen or more years with a master to complete a full course of training in koan commentary. Only when a master is satisfied that a disciple can comment appropriately on a wide range of old cases will he recognize the latter as a dharma heir and give him formal "proof of transmission" (J. ''[[inka shomei]]''). Thus, in reality, a lot more than ''satori'' is required for one to be recognized as a master (J. ''shike'', ''roshi'') in the Rinzai school of Zen at present. The accepted proof of ''satori'' is a set of literary and rhetorical skills that takes many years to acquire.{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=42}}}}

After completing the koan-training, ''Gogo no shugyo'', post-satori training is necessary:{{sfn|Hori|2005b|p=145}}
{{quote|[I]t would take 10&amp;nbsp;years to solve all the kōans [...] in the sōdō. After the student has solved all koans, he can leave the sōdō and live on his own, but he is still not considered a roshi. For this he has to complete another ten years of training, called "go-go-no-shugyō" in Japanese. Literally, this means "practice after satori/enlightenment", but [[Keido Fukushima|Fukushima]] preferred the translation "special practice". Fukushima would explain that the student builds up a "religious personality" during this decade. It is a kind of period that functions to test if the student is actually able to live in regular society and apply his koan understanding to daily life, after he has lived in an environment that can be quite surreal and detached from the lives of the rest of humanity. Usually, the student lives in small parish temple during this decade, not in a formal training monastery.&lt;ref name=antaiji10 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/adult50.shtml Muho Noelke, ''Part 10: What does it take to become a full-fledged Sōtō-shu priest and is it really worth the whole deal?'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Breathing practices====
[[Hakuin Ekaku]], the 17th&amp;nbsp;century revitalizer of the Rinzai school, taught several practices which serve to correct physical and mental imbalances arising from, among other things, incorrect or excessive koan practice.  The "soft-butter" method (''nanso no ho'') and "introspection method" (''naikan no ho'') involve cultivation of [[Qi|ki]] centered on the [[tanden]] (Chinese:[[dantian]]).  These practices are described in Hakuin's works [[Orategama]] and [[Yasen Kanna]], and are still taught in some Rinzai lineages today.

===Japanese Sōtō===
Though few Sōtō practitioners concentrate on kōans during meditation, the Sōtō sect has a strong historical connection with kōans, since many kōan collections were compiled by Sōtō priests.

During the 13th&amp;nbsp;century, [[Dōgen]], founder of the Sōtō sect in Japan, quoted 580 kōans in his teachings.{{sfn|Bodiford|1993|p=144}} He compiled some 300 kōans in the volumes known as the Greater [[Shōbōgenzō]]. Dōgen wrote of Genjokōan, which points out that everyday life experience is the fundamental kōan.

However, according to Michel Mohr,
{{quote|...kōan practice was largely expunged from the Sōtō school through the efforts of [[Gentō Sokuchū]] (1729–1807), the eleventh abbot of Entsuji, who in 1795 was nominated abbot of [[Eiheiji]]".{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=245}}}}

===Sanbo Kyodan and White Plum Asanga===
The [[Sanbō Kyōdan|Sanbo Kyodan]] school and the [[White Plum Asanga]], which originated with the Sōtō-priest [[Hakuun Yasutani]], incorporates koan-study. The Sanbo kyodan places great emphasis on [[kensho]], initial insight into one's true nature,{{sfn|Sharf|1995c}} as a start of real practice. It follows the so-called Harada-Yasutani koan-curriculum, which is derived from [[Hakuin]]'s student Takuju. It is a shortened koan-curriculum, in which the socalled "capping phrases" are removed. The curriculum takes considerably less time to study than the Takuju-curriculum of Rinzai.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=42–43}}

To attain kensho, most students are assigned the mu-koan. After breaking through, the student first studies twenty-two "in-house"{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=42}} koans, which are "unpublished and not for the general public",{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=42}} but are nevertheless published and commented upon.{{sfn|MacInnes|2007}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.mkzc.org/foreword-to-flowing-bridge-the-miscellaneous-koans/ Ruben L. F. Habito (2007), ''Foreword to Flowing Bridge: The Miscellaneous Koans'']&lt;/ref&gt; There-after, the students goes through the ''Gateless Gate'' (Mumonkan), the ''Blue Cliff Record'', the ''Book of Equanimity'', and the ''Record of Transmitting the Light''.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=42}} The koan-curriculum is completed by the [[Dongshan Liangjie#Five Ranks|Five ranks of Tozan]] and the precepts.{{sfn|Sharf|1995c|p=432}}

==Classical kōan collections==
Kōans collectively form a substantial body of literature studied by Zen practitioners and scholars worldwide. Kōan collections commonly referenced in English include:
*The ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]'' (Chinese: ''Bìyán Lù''; Japanese: ''Hekiganroku''), 12th century;
*The ''[[Book of Equanimity]]'' (also known as the ''Book of Serenity''; Chinese: ''Cóngróng Lù''; Japanese: ''Shoyoroku''), 12th century;
*''[[The Gateless Gate]]'' (also known as ''The Gateless Barrier''; Chinese: ''Wúménguān''; Japanese: ''Mumonkan'') collected during the 13th&amp;nbsp;century).
In these and subsequent collections, a terse "main case" of a kōan often accompanies prefatory remarks, poems, proverbs and other phrases, and further commentary about prior emendations.

===The Blue Cliff Record===
The ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]'' (Chinese: {{lang|zh|碧巖錄}} Bìyán Lù; Japanese: Hekiganroku) is a collection of 100 kōans compiled in 1125 by [[Yuanwu Keqin]] ({{lang|zh|圜悟克勤}} 1063–1135).

===The Book of Equanimity===
The ''[[Book of Equanimity]]'' or ''Book of Serenity'' (Chinese: {{lang|zh|從容録}} Cóngróng lù; Japanese: {{lang|ja|従容録}} Shōyōroku) is a collection of 100 Kōans by [[Hongzhi Zhengjue]] (Chinese: {{lang|zh|宏智正覺}}; Japanese: Wanshi Shōgaku) (1091–1157), compiled with commentaries by [[Wansong Xingxiu]] (1166–1246). The full title is ''The Record of the Temple of Equanimity With the Classic Odes of Venerable Tiantong Jue and the Responsive Commentary of Old Man Wansong'' {{lang|zh|萬松老評唱天童覺和尚 頌古從容庵錄}} (Wansong Laoren Pingchang Tiantong Jue Heshang Songgu Congrong An Lu) (Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 48, No. 2004)

===The Gateless Gate===
''[[The Gateless Gate]]'' (Chinese: {{lang|zh|無門關}} Wumenguan; Japanese: Mumonkan) is a collection of 48 kōans and commentaries published in 1228 by Chinese monk [[Wumen]] ({{lang|zh|無門}}) (1183–1260). The title may be more accurately rendered as ''Gateless Barrier'' or ''Gateless Checkpoint'').

Five kōans in the collection derive from the sayings and doings of [[Zhaozhou Congshen]], (transliterated as Chao-chou in Wade-Giles and pronounced Jōshū in Japanese).

===The True Dharma Eye===
''[[Shinji Shōbōgenzō|The True Dharma Eye 300]]'' ([[Shōbōgenzō]] Sanbyakusoku) is a collection of 300 kōans compiled by [[Eihei Dōgen]].
Upon arriving in China, Dogen Kigen first studied under Wuji Lepai, a disciple of Dahui, which is where he probably came into contact with [[Dahui Zonggao]]s (大慧宗杲) (1089–1163) Shōbōgenzō, the ''Zhengfayan zang'' (正法眼藏), "Treasury of the true dharma eye" (W-G.: Cheng-fa yen-tsang, J.: Shōbōgenzō) a collection of koans and dialogues compiled between 1147 and 1150 by [[Dahui Zonggao]] . Dahui's Shōbōgenzō is composed of three scrolls prefaced by three short introductory pieces. The Zongmen liandeng huiyao 宗門聯燈會要 was compiled in 1183 by Huiweng Wuming 晦翁悟明 (n.d.), three generations after Dahui in the same line; the sermon is found in zh 20 (x 79: 173a).

Other kōan collections compiled and annotated by Sōtō priests include:
*''The Iron Flute'' (Japanese: ''Tetteki Tosui'', compiled by Genro in 1783)
*''Verses and Commentaries on One Hundred Old Cases of Tenchian'' (Japanese: ''Tenchian hyakusoku hyoju'', compiled by Tetsumon in 1771.)

==Examples of traditional kōans==
&lt;!-- Note to editors: the list in this section should not attempt to interpret the meanings --&gt;

===Does a dog have Buddha-nature===
{{Main|Mu (negative)}}

{{quote|A monk asked [[Zhaozhou Congshen|Zhàozhōu]], "Does a dog have [[Buddha nature]] or not?" Zhaozhou said, "[[Mu (negative)|Wú]]".}}

("Zhaozhou" is rendered as "Chao-chou" in [[Wade-Giles]], and pronounced "Joshu" in Japanese. "Wu" appears as "mu" in Japanese, meaning "no", "not", "nonbeing", or "without" in English. This is a fragment of Case #1 of the ''[[The Gateless Gate|Wúménguān]]''. However, another koan presents a longer version, in which Zhaozhou answered "yes" in response to the same question asked by a different monk: see Case #18 of the ''Book of Serenity''.)

===The sound of one hand===
{{quote
|text=''Two hands clap and there is a sound. What is the sound of one hand?'' ({{lang|ja|隻手声あり、その声を聞け}})
|sign=[[Hakuin Ekaku]]
}}

Victor Hori comments:
{{quote|...in the beginning a monk first thinks a kōan is an inert object upon which to focus attention; after a long period of consecutive repetition, one realizes that the kōan is also a dynamic activity, the very activity of seeking an answer to the kōan. The kōan is both the object being sought and the relentless seeking itself. In a kōan, the self sees the self not directly but under the guise of the kōan ... When one realizes ("makes real") this identity, then two hands have become one. The practitioner becomes the kōan that he or she is trying to understand. That is the sound of one hand.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/Bulletin_and_Shoho/pdf/23-Hori.pdf G. Victor Sogen Hori (1999), ''Translating the Zen Phrase Book''. Nanzan Bulletin 23, 1999, p. 44–58]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Original Face===
{{Main|Original face}}

[[Huineng|Huìnéng]] asked [[Hui Ming]], "Without thinking of good or evil, show me your original face before your mother and father were born." (This is a fragment of case #23 of the ''Wumenguan''.)

===Killing the Buddha===
{{quote
|text=''If you meet the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], kill him.'' ({{lang|zh|逢佛殺佛}})
|sign=[[Linji Yixuan|Linji]]
}}

Thinking about the Buddha as an entity or deity is delusion, not awakening. One must destroy the preconception of the Buddha as separate and external before one can become internally as their own Buddha. Zen master [[Shunryu Suzuki]] wrote in ''[[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]]'' during an introduction to [[Zazen]],
{{quote|Kill the Buddha if the Buddha exists somewhere else. Kill the Buddha, because you should resume your own Buddha nature.}}

One is only able to see a Buddha as he exists in separation from Buddha; the mind of the practitioner is thus still holding onto apparent duality.

===Other koans===
*A student asked Master Yun-Men (A.D. 949) "Not even a thought has arisen; is there still a sin or not?" Master replied, "[[Mount Sumeru]]!"
*A monk asked [[Dongshan Shouchu]], "What is Buddha?" Dongshan said, "Three pounds of [[flax]]." (This is a fragment of case #18 of the ''Wumenguan'' as well as case #12 of the ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]''.)
*A monk asked Zhaozhou, "What is the meaning of the ancestral teacher's (i.e., [[Bodhidharma]]'s) coming from the west?" Zhaozhou said, "The cypress tree in front of the hall." (This is a fragment of case #37 of the ''Wumenguan'' as well as case #47 of the ''Book of Serenity''.)

This section of the [[list of rampage killers]] contains mass murders, committed by [[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf perpetrators]], that have a foremost [[fundamentalism|religious]], [[racism|racial]] or political background.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator(s) are not counted among those killed or injured.

All abbreviations used in the table are explained [[#Abbreviations and footnotes|below]]. &lt;!--Additions should be made 1) in order of # of fatalities, and 2) # injured--&gt;

A '''loop''' in [[mathematics]], in a [[topological space]] ''X'' is a [[continuous function]] ''f'' from the [[unit interval]] ''I'' = [0,1] to ''X'' such that ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''(1). In other words, it is a [[path (topology)|path]] whose initial point is equal to the terminal point.&lt;ref name="ils"&gt;{{citation|title=Infinite Loop Spaces|volume=90|series=Annals of mathematics studies|first=John Frank|last=Adams|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1978|isbn=9780691082066|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2rYkg9lGnsC&amp;pg=PA3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A loop may also be seen as a continuous map ''f'' from the [[Pointed space|pointed]] [[unit circle]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; into ''X'', because ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; may be regarded as a [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient]] of ''I'' under the identification of 0 with 1.

The set of all loops in ''X'' forms a space called the [[loop space]] of ''X''.&lt;ref name="ils"/&gt;

The '''maximum power principle''' or '''Lotka's principle'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tilley |first1=David Rogers |title=Howard T. Odum’s contribution to the laws of energy |journal=Ecological Modelling |date=2004 |volume=178 |pages=121–125 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.12.032 |url=http://www.unicamp.br/fea/ortega/extensao/davidtilley-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed as the fourth [[Principles of energetics|principle of energetics]] in [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] [[thermodynamics]], where an example of an open system is a biological cell. According to [[Howard T. Odum]], "The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency."&lt;ref&gt;H.T. Odum 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;311&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chen (2006) has located the origin of the statement of maximum power as a formal principle in a tentative proposal by [[Alfred J. Lotka]] (1922a, b). Lotka's statement sought to explain the Darwinian notion of evolution with reference to a physical principle. Lotka's work was subsequently developed by the [[systems ecology|systems ecologist]] [[Howard T. Odum]] in collaboration with the Chemical Engineer Richard C. Pinkerton, and later advanced by the Engineer [[Myron Tribus]].

While Lotka's work may have been a first attempt to formalise evolutionary thought in mathematical terms, it followed similar observations made by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Vito Volterra|Volterra]] and Ludwig [[Boltzmann]], for example, throughout the sometimes controversial history of natural philosophy.  In contemporary literature it is most commonly associated with the work of Howard T. Odum.

The significance of Odum's approach was given greater support during the 1970s, amid times of [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], where, as Gilliland (1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;100) observed, there was an emerging need for a new method of analysing the importance and value of energy resources to economic and environmental production. A field known as [[energy analysis]], itself associated with [[net energy]] and [[EROEI]], arose to fulfill this analytic need. However, in energy analysis intractable theoretical and practical difficulties arose when using the [[energy unit]] to understand, a) the conversion among concentrated fuel types (or [[energy types]]), b)  the contribution of labour, and c) the contribution of the environment.

==Philosophy and theory==
Lotka said (1922b: 151): 
{{cquote|The principle of natural selection reveals itself as capable of yielding information which the first and second laws of thermodynamics are not competent to furnish. The two fundamental laws of thermodynamics are, of course, insufficient to determine the course of events in a physical system. They tell us that certain things cannot happen, but they do not tell us what does happen.}}

Gilliland noted that these difficulties in analysis in turn required some new theory to adequately explain the interactions and transactions of these different energies (different concentrations of fuels, labour and environmental forces). Gilliland (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101) suggested that Odum's statement of the maximum power principle (H.T.Odum 1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–87) was, perhaps, an adequate expression of the requisite theory:
{{cquote|That theory, as it is expressed by the maximum power principle, addresses the empirical question of why systems of any type or size organize themselves into the patterns observed. Such a question assumes that physical laws govern system function. It does not assume, for example, that the system comprising economic production is driven by consumers; rather that the whole cycle of production-consumption is structured and driven by physical laws.}}

This theory Odum called maximum power theory. In order to formulate maximum power theory Gilliland observed that Odum had added another law (the maximum power principle) to the already well established laws of thermodynamics. In 1978 Gilliland wrote that Odum's new law had not yet been validated (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101). Gilliland stated that in maximum power theory the [[second law efficiency]] of thermodynamics required an additional physical concept: "the concept of second law efficiency under maximum power" (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101):

{{cquote|Neither the first or second law of thermodynamics include a measure of the rate at which energy transformations or processes occur. The concept of maximum power incorporates time into measures of energy transformations. It provides information about the rate at which one kind of energy is transformed into another as well as the efficiency of that transformation.}} 
     
In this way the concept of maximum power was being used as a principle to quantitatively describe the selective law of biological [[evolution]]. Perhaps H.T.Odum's most concise statement of this view was (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;62):

{{cquote|Lotka provided the theory of natural selection as a maximum power organizer; under competitive conditions systems are selected which use their energies in various structural-developing actions so as to maximize their use of available energies. By this theory systems of cycles which drain less energy lose out in comparative development. However Leopold and Langbein have shown that streams in developing erosion profiles, meander systems, and tributary networks disperse their potential energies more slowly than if their channels were more direct. These two statements might be harmonized by an optimum efficiency maximum power principle (Odum and Pinkerton 1955), which indicates that energies which are converted too rapidly into heat are not made available to the systems own use because they are not fed back through storages into useful pumping, but instead do random stirring of the environment.}}

The Odum–Pinkerton approach to Lotka's proposal was to apply [[Ohm's law]] – and the associated [[maximum power theorem]] (a result in [[electric power|electrical power]] systems) – to ecological systems. Odum and Pinkerton defined "power" in electronic terms as the rate of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], where Work is understood as a "[[Thermodynamic free energy|useful energy]] transformation". &lt;!-- (In electrical engineering and physics, "[[Power (physics)|power]]" is defined as the rate of doing work or consuming energy, without any distinction between "useful energy" and any other energy.) --&gt;The concept of maximum power can therefore be defined as the '''''maximum''' rate of '''useful''' energy transformation''. Hence the underlying philosophy aims to unify the theories and associated laws of electronic and thermodynamic systems with biological systems. This approach presupposed an [[Analogical models|analogical view]] which sees the world as an ecological-electronic-economic engine.

==Proposals for maximum power principle as 4th thermodynamic law==
{{quotation|It has been pointed out by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] that the fundamental object of contention in the life-struggle, in the evolution of the organic world, is available energy. In accord with this observation is the principle that, in the struggle for existence, the advantage must go to those organisms whose energy-capturing devices are most efficient in directing available energy into channels favorable to the preservation of the species.|A.J. Lotka 1922a, p. 147}}

{{quotation|...it seems to this author appropriate to unite the biological and physical traditions by giving the Darwinian principle of natural selection the citation as the ''fourth law of thermodynamics'', since it is the controlling principle in rate of heat generation and efficiency settings in irreversible biological processes.|H.T. Odum 1963, p. 437}}

{{quotation|...it may be time to recognize the maximum power principle as the fourth thermodynamic law as suggested by Lotka.|H.T. Odum 1994}}

==Definition in words==
{{cquote|The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency. (H.T. Odum 1995, p. 311)}}

{{cquote|...the maximum power principle ... states that systems which maximize their flow of energy survive in competition. In other words, rather than merely accepting the fact that more energy per unit of time is transformed in a process which operates at maximum power, this principle says that systems organize and structure themselves naturally to maximize power. Systems regulate themselves according to the maximum power principle. Over time, the systems which maximize power are selected for whereas those that do not are selected against and eventually eliminated. ... Odum argues ... that the free market mechanisms of the economy effectively do the same thing for human systems and that our economic evolution to date is a product of that selection process. (Gilliland 1978, pp. 101–102)}}

Odum et al. viewed the [[maximum power theorem]] as a principle of '''power-efficiency reciprocity selection''' with wider application than just electronics. For example, Odum saw it in open systems operating on solar energy, like both photovoltaics and photosynthesis (1963, p.&amp;nbsp;438). Like the maximum power theorem, Odum's statement of the maximum power principle relies on the notion of 'matching', such that high-quality energy maximizes power by matching and amplifying energy (1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;262, 541): "in surviving designs a matching of high-quality energy with larger amounts of low-quality energy is likely to occur" (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;260). As with electronic circuits, the resultant rate of energy transformation will be at a maximum at an intermediate power efficiency. In 2006, T.T. Cai, C.L. Montague and J.S. Davis said that, "The maximum power principle is a potential guide to understanding the patterns and processes of ecosystem development and sustainability. The principle predicts the selective persistence of ecosystem designs that capture a previously untapped energy source." (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;317). In several texts H.T. Odum gave the [[Atwood machine]] as a practical example of the 'principle' of maximum power.

=== Mathematical definition ===
The mathematical definition given by H.T. Odum is formally analogous to the definition provided on the [[maximum power theorem]] article. (For a brief explanation of Odum's approach to the relationship between ecology and electronics see [[Howard T. Odum#Ecological analog of Ohm.27s Law|Ecological Analog of Ohm's Law]])

==Contemporary ideas==
Whether or not the principle of maximum power efficiency can be considered the fourth law of thermodynamics and the fourth principle of energetics is moot. Nevertheless, H.T. Odum also proposed a corollary of maximum power as the organisational principle of evolution, describing the evolution of [[microbiological]] systems, [[economic systems]], [[planet]]ary systems, and [[astrophysical]] systems. He called this corollary the '''[[Maximum empower#Empower and maximum empower|maximum empower]]''' principle.  This was suggested because, as S.E. Jorgensen, M.T. Brown, H.T. Odum (2004) note,

{{quotation|Maximum power might be misunderstood to mean giving priority to low level processes. ... However, the higher level transformation processes are just as important as the low level processes. ... Therefore, Lotka's principle is clarified by stating it as the principle of self organization for maximum ''empower''. |p. 18}}

C. Giannantoni may have confused matters when he wrote "The "Maximum Em-Power Principle" (Lotka–Odum) is generally considered the "Fourth Thermodynamic Principle" (mainly) because of its practical validity for a very wide class of physical and biological systems" (C. Giannantoni 2002, § 13, p.&amp;nbsp;155). Nevertheless,  Giannantoni has proposed the Maximum Em-Power Principle as the fourth principle of thermodynamics (Giannantoni 2006).

The preceding discussion is incomplete. The "maximum power" was discovered several times independently, in physics and engineering, see: Novikov (1957), El-Wakil (1962), and Curzon and Ahlborn (1975). The incorrectness of this analysis and design evolution conclusions was demonstrated by Gyftopoulos (2002).

The [[simulation]] technique used is a next event '''[[Monte Carlo Simulation]]''', with full array of building blocks, animation, graphical interface, unlimited hierarchical decomposition, full connectivity and interactivity with other programs, library based, build in compiled [[C (programming language)|C]]-like programming language, to mention some of the most important features. The flexible method enables modelling of multi purpose tasks like system availability, on demand failure probability, multiple product flow, loading/storage capacities and spare part optimization. In offshore development projects all these features are used during the concept selection process. There is an interface between the simulation tool and [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] for input data, which makes it easy to structure data, extract data, running sensitivities and customize results presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monte Carlo Simulation|url=http://www.palisade.com/risk/monte_carlo_simulation.asp|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simulation tool is built of hierarchical blocks where blocks can be constructed by the user, both regarding interface (pictures etc.) and programming the logic of the block. This feature is used to build up the model as a flow network with similar interface as a PFD ([[process flow diagram]]).  The flow net-work is intended to simplify the comprehension of the availability model for design engineers and management. Although some customers used to reliability block diagrams (RBD), prefer this interface for transparency, showing component redundancy instead of product flow.

Generally, this is a marriage between a man of high birth (such as from a [[reign]]ing, [[abolished monarchy|deposed]] or [[mediatisation|mediatised]] dynasty) and a woman of lesser status (such as a daughter of a [[German nobility#Divisions of nobility|low-ranked noble]] family or a commoner).&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org Webster's Online Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223164907/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/ |date=2012-02-23 }}.

[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]. Volume 18. ''Morganatic Marriage''. University Press, 1911, p. 835.&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, a woman could also marry a man of lower rank morganatically.

After World War I the heads of both ruling and [[abolished monarchy|formerly reigning dynasties]] initially continued the practice of rejecting dynastic titles and/or rights for descendants of "morganatic" unions, but gradually allowed them, sometimes retroactively, effectively de-morganatizing the wives and children. This was accommodated by [[Justus Perthes (publishing company)|Perthes']] ''[[Almanach de Gotha]]'' (which categorised princely families by rank until it ceased publication after 1944) by inserting the offspring of such marriages in a third section of the almanac under entries denoted by a symbol (a dot within a circle) that "signifies some princely houses which, possessing no specific princely [[letters patent|patent]], have passed from the first part, A, or from the second part into the third part in virtue of special agreements."&lt;ref name = "gotha"&gt;''[[Almanach de Gotha]]'' (Gotha: [[Justus Perthes]], 1944), pages 43, 363–364, 529. French&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Fürst]]liche Häuser'' ("Princely Houses") series of the ''Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels'' ("Genealogical Manual of the Nobility") has followed this lead, likewise enrolling some issue of unapproved marriages in its third section, "III B", with a similar explanation: "Families in this section, although verified, received no specific [[letters patent|decree]], but have been included by special agreement in the 1st and 2nd sections".&lt;ref name="ghda"&gt;''«Die in dieser Abteilung nachgewiesenen Familien besitzen kein besonderes Diplom, sondern sind nach besonderer Übereinkunft aus der 1. und 2. &lt;!--Do not remove the dots.

Starke Verlag, 1991, p. 565. {{ISBN|3-7980-0700-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations of morganatic marriage were also practised by non-European dynasties, such as the [[Royal Family of Thailand]], the polygamous [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] as to their non-principal wives, and other families of Africa and Asia.

== Etymology ==
''Morganatic'', already in use in English by 1727 (according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''), is derived from the [[Latin|medieval Latin]] ''morganaticus'' from the [[Late Latin]] phrase ''matrimonium ad morganaticam'' and refers to the gift given by the groom to the bride on the morning after the wedding, the [[morning gift]], i.e., [[dower]]. The Latin term, applied to a Germanic custom, was adopted from the [[Old High German]] term ''*morgangeba'' (modern German ''Morgengabe''), corresponding to Early English ''morgengifu''. The literal meaning is explained in a 16th-century passage quoted by [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Du Cange]] as, "a marriage by which the wife and the children that may be born are entitled to no share in the husband's possessions beyond the 'morning-gift'".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd Edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philo"&gt;[[Philological Society]]. A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles. ''Morganatic''. Clarendon Press, 1908. p. 663.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''morning gift'' has been a customary property arrangement for marriage found first in early medieval German cultures (such as the [[Lombards]]) and also among ancient Germanic tribes, and the church drove its adoption into other countries in order to improve the wife's security by this ''additional'' benefit. The bride received property from the bridegroom's clan. It was intended to ensure her livelihood in widowhood, and it was to be kept separate as the wife's discrete possession. However, when a marriage contract is made wherein the bride and the children of the marriage will not receive anything else (other than the dower) from the bridegroom or from his inheritance or clan, that sort of marriage was dubbed as "marriage with only the dower and no other inheritance", i.e., ''matrimonium morganaticum''.

== Examples ==
Royal men who married morganatically:
* [[Genghis Khan]] followed the contemporary tradition by taking several morganatic wives in addition to his principal wife, whose [[ultimogeniture|property passed to their youngest son]], also following tradition.
* King [[Erik XIV of Sweden]] married the servant [[Karin Månsdotter]] morganatically in 1567, and later secondly, but this time not morganatically, in 1568.
* [[Ludwig Wilhelm, Duke in Bavaria]] and (actress) [[Henriette Mendel]]. She was created Baroness von Wallersee, and their daughter, [[Marie Louise, Countess Larisch von Moennich]], was a confidante of Empress [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Elisabeth ("Sissi") of Austria]].
* Archduke [[Ferdinand II of Austria]], ruler of the [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]] first married [[Philippine Welser]], a [[bourgeois]]e of a wealthy family; their children were given the title Margrave von Burgau, the issue of Ferdinand's second (and equal) marriage being of archducal rank and preferred for purposes of inheritance.
* [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]] in 1869 married morganatically his principal mistress [[Rosa Teresa Vercellana Guerrieri]] (3 June 1833 – 26 December 1885). Popularly known in [[Piedmontese]] as "Bela Rosin" (Little Rosa the Beautiful), she was born a commoner but made Countess di Mirafiori e Fontanafredda in 1858.
* Late in his life, the widowed ex-king [[Fernando II of Portugal]] married the opera singer [[Elise Hensler]], who was created Countess von Edla.
* A list of [[morganatic branches of the Russian Imperial Family]]
* The 1900 marriage of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], whose subsequent assassination triggered World War I, to [[Sophie Chotek|Countess Sophie Chotek]] was morganatic at the insistence of the Austrian Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Max|last1=Hastings|author-link1=Max Hastings|title=Catastrophe: Europe Goes to War 1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mu2-BrJnZjUC|year=2013|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=978-0-00-751975-0|page=xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Royal women who married morganatically:
* [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]] (by birth an [[archduchess]] of the Imperial [[House of Habsburg]], and by her first marriage a French empress) married morganatically twice after the death of her husband, [[Emperor of the French#Napoleon I|the emperor]] Napoleon I, in 1821. Her second husband was [[Adam Albert von Neipperg|Count Adam Albert von Neipperg]]. After his death, she married Count [[Charles-René de Bombelles]], her chamberlain, in 1834.
* Queen [[Maria Christina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]], regent of Spain after her husband's ([[Ferdinand VII]]) death while their daughter, the future [[Isabella II]] was a minor. She married one of her guards in a secret marriage.
* Princess [[Stéphanie of Belgium]], the widow of [[Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria]], married Count Elemér Lónyay de Nagy-Lónya et Vásáros-Namény after the death of her first husband. In 1917, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]], conferred upon Lónyay a [[Dynasty#Dynasts|non-dynastic]] title of prince (''[[Fürst]]'').

==History==

=== Denmark ===
Succession to the Danish throne followed the specifications of the ''[[Lex Regia]]'' until the [[Danish Act of Succession]] was passed in 1953. Prominent morganatic marriages include the 1615 marriage of King [[Christian IV of Denmark]] to [[Danish nobility|noblewoman]] [[Kirsten Munk]]. Kirsten was titled "Countess of Schleswig-Holstein" and bore the King 12 children, all styled "Count/Countess of Schleswig-Holstein". [[Frederick VII of Denmark|King Frederick VII]] married the ballerina [[Louise Rasmussen]], who was raised to the rank of "Countess Danner" in 1850. There were no children of this marriage. When [[Christian IX of Denmark]]'s brother, [[Prince Julius of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg]] married Elisabeth von Ziegesar in 1883, the king granted her the title "Countess af [[Røst]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bricka, Carl Fredrik and Laursen, Laurs. Dansk Biografisk Lexikon. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=yJwZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA617&amp;lpg=PA617&amp;dq=Julius+%22af+Roest%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6DXGZ3g9xF&amp;sig=SchIs-yY27LVRrBkO2y0MUcvVTM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wb3KT5XLMMnW2gXOjc3ZCw&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Julius af Glucksborg]''. Gyldendalske Boghandels Forlag, 1894. Volume 8, p. 617. (Danish).&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1971, Danish princes who married women who did not belong to a royal or noble family were refused the sovereign's authorization, renouncing their right of succession to the throne and royal title ([[Prince Aage of Denmark]] morganatically [[elopement (marriage)|eloped]] with Matilda Calvi, daughter of Count Carlo Giorgio di Bergolo, in January 1914 but renounced his dynastic rights and titles subsequently).&lt;ref name="secrets"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "gotha"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roskildehistorie.dk/stamtavler/konger/7_Glyksborg/Rosenborg.htm History of Roskilde]. ''[http://www.roskildehistorie.dk/stamtavler/konger/7_Glyksborg/Rosenborg.htm Royal House: Rosenborg]''. Retrieved 2012/5/2. Danish.&lt;/ref&gt; They were granted the non-royal prefix of "Prince" and their descendants bear the title [[Count of Rosenborg|Count af Rosenborg]] in the [[Danish nobility]].

Neither of the children of [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]] has married a person of either royal birth or of the titled aristocracy. Members of the Royal Family may still lose their place in the line of succession for themselves and their descendants if they marry without the monarch's permission.

=== France ===
Morganatic marriage was not recognized in French law.&lt;ref name="montjouvent"&gt;de Montjouvent, Philippe. Le comte de Paris et sa descendance. ''Introduction sur la Maison royale de France''. Du Chaney Eds, Paris, 1998, p. 11. French. {{ISBN|2-913211-00-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the law did not distinguish, for marital purposes, between ruler and subjects, marriages between royalty and the noble heiresses to great [[fief]]s became the norm through the 16th century, helping to aggrandize the [[House of Capet]] while gradually diminishing the number of large domains held in theoretical vassalage by nobles who were, in practice, virtually independent of the French crown: by the marriage of [[Catherine de' Medici]] to the future [[Henry II of France|King Henry II]] in 1533, the last of these provinces, the [[List of rulers of Auvergne#List of Carolingian and French Counts|county of Auvergne]], came to the crown of France.&lt;ref name="anselme"&gt;{{cite book | title=Histoire de la Maison Royale de France | publisher=Editions du Palais Royal | author=[[Père Anselme]] | year=1967 | location=Paris | pages=531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antiquity of nobility in the legitimate male line, not noble [[quartering (heraldry)|quartering]]s, was the main criterion of rank in the ''[[ancien régime]]''.&lt;ref name="roque"&gt;de la Roque, Gilles-Andre. Traite de la Noblesse. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VC-OqGr2os0C&amp;q=nom+%26+d'armes&amp;hl=fr&amp;source=gbs_word_cloud_r&amp;cad=5#v=snippet&amp;q=nom%20%26%20d'armes&amp;f=false Du Gentilhomme de nom et d'armes]''. Etienne Michalet, Paris, 1678, pp. 5, 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the status of a British peer's wife and descendants (yet typical of the nobility of every [[continental Europe]]an country), the legitimate children and male-line descendants of any French nobleman (whether titled or not, whether possessing a [[Peerage of France|French peerage]] or not) were also legally noble ''ad infinitum''.&lt;ref name="roque"/&gt; Rank was not based on hereditary titles, which were often assumed or [[Nobility#Ennoblement|acquired by purchase of a noble estate]] rather than granted by the Crown. Rather, the main determinant of relative rank among the French nobility was how far back the nobility of a family's male line could be verifiably traced.&lt;ref name="roque"/&gt; Other factors influencing rank included the family's history of military command, high-ranking offices held at court and marriages into other high-ranking families. A specific exception was made for bearers of the title of duke who, regardless of their origin, outranked all other nobles. But the ducal title in post-medieval France (even when embellished with the still higher status of "peer") ranked its holder and his family among France's nobility and not, as in Germany and Scandinavia (and, occasionally, Italy, [[viz.]] [[House of Savoy|Savoy]], [[House of Medici|Medici]], [[House of Este|Este]], [[House of della Rovere|della Rovere]], [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] and [[Cybo|Cybo-Malaspina]]) among Europe's [[reign]]ing dynasties which habitually [[royal intermarriage|intermarried]] with one another.

Once the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] inherited the throne of France from the [[House of Valois]] in 1589, their [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynasts]] married daughters of even the oldest ducal families of France — let alone noblewomen of lower rank — quite rarely (viz., [[Anne de Montafié, Countess of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis|Anne de Montafié]] in 1601, [[Charlotte Marguerite de Montmorency]] in 1609 and, in exile from revolutionary France, [[Maria Caterina Brignole]] in 1798). Exceptions were made for equal [[royal intermarriage]] with the ''[[Foreign Prince|princes étrangers]]'' and, by royal command, with the so-called ''[[Prince du sang#Legitimised royal offspring|princes légitimés]]'' (i.e., out-of-wedlock but [[bastardy|legitimised]] descendants of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] and [[Louis XIV]]), as well as with the nieces of Cardinal-prime ministers (i.e., [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]], [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]]). Just as the French king could authorize a royal marriage that would otherwise have been deemed unsuitable, by 1635 it had been established by [[Louis XIII]] that the king could also legally void the canonically valid, [[Royal intermarriage|equal marriage]] of a French dynast to which he had not given consent (e.g., [[Marguerite of Lorraine#Marriage|Marguerite of Lorraine, Duchess of Orléans]]).&lt;ref name="Blet"&gt;Blet, Pierre. Le Clergé de France et la Monarchie, Etude sur les Assemblées Générales du Clergé de 1615 à 1666. Université Grégorienne, Rome, 1959, pp. 399-439.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="degert"&gt;Degert, (Abbé). "Le mariage de Gaston d'Orléans et de Marguerite de Lorraine," ''Revue Historique'' 143:161-80, 144:1-57. French.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, there was a [[France|French]] practice, legally distinct from morganatic marriage but used in similar situations of inequality in status between a member of the royal family and a spouse of lower rank: an "openly secret" marriage. French kings authorized such marriages only when the bride was past child-bearing or the marrying prince already had dynastic heirs by a previous spouse of royal descent. The marriage ceremony took place without [[banns]], in private (with only a priest, the bride and groom, and a few legal witnesses present), and the marriage was never officially acknowledged (although sometimes widely known). Thus, the wife never publicly shared in her husband's titles, rank, or coat of arms.&lt;ref name="pothier"&gt;Pothier, Robert. Traité des successions, Chapitre I, section I, article 3, § 4. French.&lt;/ref&gt; The lower-ranked spouse, male or female, could only receive from the royal spouse what property the king allowed.

In secret marriage, Louis XIV wed his second wife, [[Madame de Maintenon]], in 1683 (she was nearly 50, so no children were likely); [[Louis, Grand Dauphin|Louis the Grand Dauphin]] wed [[Marie Émilie de Joly de Choin]] in 1695; Anne Marie d'Orléans (''[[Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier|La Grande Mademoiselle]]'') wed [[Antoine Nompar de Caumont|Antoine, Duke de Lauzun]] in 1682; and [[Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orléans]] wed the [[Madame de Montesson|Marquise de Montesson]] in 1773. The mechanism of the "secret marriage" rendered it unnecessary for France to legislate the morganatic marriage ''per se''.&lt;ref name="webster"/&gt; Within post-monarchical dynasties, until the end of the 20th century the heads of the Spanish and Italian Bourbon branches, the Orléans of both France and Brazil, and the Imperial Bonapartes have, in exile, exercised claimed authority to exclude from their dynasty descendants born of unapproved marriages — albeit without calling these marriages "morganatic".

===German-speaking Europe===
The practice of morganatic marriage was most common in the [[German language|German-speaking]] parts of Europe, where equality of birth (''Ebenbürtigkeit'') between the spouses was considered an important principle among the reigning houses and high nobility.&lt;ref name="philo"/&gt; The German name was ''Ehe zur linken Hand'' ("marriage by the left hand") and the husband gave his left hand during the wedding ceremony instead of the right.&lt;ref name="secrets"/&gt;

Perhaps the most famous example in modern times was the 1900 marriage of the heir to the throne of [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], and Bohemian aristocrat [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Countess Sophie Chotek von Chotkowa]]. The marriage was initially resisted by [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph I]], but after pressure from family members and other European rulers, he relented in 1899 (but did not attend the wedding himself). The bride was made [[Fürst|Princess]] (later [[Herzog|Duchess]]) of [[House of Hohenberg|Hohenberg]], their children took their mother's new name and rank, but were excluded from the imperial succession. The [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Sarajevo assassination]] in 1914, killing both the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, triggered the [[World War I|First World War]].

Although the issue of morganatic marriages were ineligible to succeed to their families' respective thrones, children of morganatic marriages have gone on to achieve dynastic success elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref name="secrets"/&gt; Descendants of the 1851 marriage of [[Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine]] to the German-Polish noblewoman [[Countess Julia von Hauke]] (created Princess of [[Battenberg, Hesse|Battenberg]]) include [[Alexander of Bulgaria|Alexander, sovereign prince of Bulgaria]], queen-consorts of Spain ([[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]]) and of Sweden ([[Louise Mountbatten]]), and, in the female line, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] (through his paternal grandmother, Alice of Battenberg).

Likewise, from the morganatic marriage of [[Duke Alexander of Württemberg (1804–1885)|Duke Alexander of Württemberg]] and [[Countess Claudine Rhédey von Kis-Rhéde]] (created Countess von Hohenstein) descends [[Mary of Teck]], who became Britain's queen in 1911 as the consort of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].

Occasionally, children of morganatic marriages have overcome their non-dynastic origins and succeeded to their family's realms. [[Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden|Margrave Leopold]] inherited the throne of Baden, despite being born of a morganatic marriage, after all dynastic males of the [[House of Zähringen]] died out. The son of [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden]], by his second wife [[Louise Caroline of Hochberg|Louise Caroline Geyer von Geyersberg]], who belonged to the minor nobility, Leopold became a prince in 1817, at the age of 27, as the result of a new law of succession. Baden's grand-ducal family faced extinction, so Leopold was enfranchised by international treaty and married to a princess, ascending the throne in 1830. His descendants ruled the grand duchy until the abolition of the monarchy in 1918.

Other reigning German families adopted similar approaches when facing a lack of male heirs. In 1896 the Princely [[House of Schwarzburg]], with the Sondershausen branch numbering two elderly childless princes and Rudolstadt just one childless prince, recognised [[Sizzo, Prince of Schwarzburg|Prince Sizzo von Leutenberg]], morganatic son of [[Friedrich Günther, Prince of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt]], as a Prince of Schwarzburg and heir to the two principalities.

The senior line of the dynasty ruling the [[Principality of Lippe]] was bordering on extinction as the 20th century approached, prompting a succession dispute between the [[Lippe-Biesterfeld]] and [[Schaumburg-Lippe]] branches of the dynasty which evoked international intervention and troop movements. It centered on whether some ancestresses of the Biesterfeld branch had been legally dynastic; if so, that line stood next to inherit the princely crown according to primogeniture. If not, the Biesterfelds would be deemed morganatic and the Schaumburg-Lippes would inherit the throne. Lippe's Parliament was blocked from voting on the matter by the German Empire's ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'', which instead created a panel of jurists selected by the King of Saxony to evaluate the evidence concerning the historical marital rules of the House of Lippe and render a decision in the matter, all parties agreeing to abide by their judgment. In 1897 and 1905 panels ruled in favour of the dynasticity of the challenged ancestresses and their descendants, largely because, although neither had been of dynastic rank, the Lippes had historically accepted such marriages when approved by the Head of House.&lt;ref name="encycl2"&gt;"[[Hugh Chisholm]], editor. [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]. Volume 16. ''[[Lippe]]''. University Press, 1911, pp. 740-741.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="velde2"&gt;Velde, Francois. Heraldica.org.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a few families considered in Germany to be morganatic were considered for crowns elsewhere, constituting unexpected rehabilitation of their status.&lt;ref name="secrets"/&gt; The first of these was [[Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|Prince Alexander of Battenberg]], who in 1877 was agreed upon by the [[Great Powers]] as the best candidate for the new throne of Bulgaria. He was, however, unable to hold onto his crown, and was also unable to obtain the hand in marriage of [[Princess Viktoria of Prussia]] despite the efforts of her [[Victoria, German Empress|imperial mother]] and [[Queen Victoria|grandmother]].

[[Mindaugas II#Candidate for various thrones|Wilhelm, Duke of Urach]] (1864–1928), whose father was the morganatic son of a Württemberg prince, had the distinction of being under consideration for the crowns of five realms at different times: that of the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]] in the 1890s, as the senior [[patrilineality|agnate]] by primogeniture when it became likely that [[William II of Württemberg|King William II]] would die without male descendants, leaving as heir [[Duke Albrecht of Württemberg]], a more distantly related, albeit dynastic, royal kinsman; the [[Principality of Albania]] in 1913; the [[Prince of Monaco|Principality of Monaco]] at turn of the 20th century, as the next heir by [[proximity of blood]] following the [[Louis II of Monaco|Hereditary Prince Louis]], until the [[Monaco succession crisis of 1918]] was resolved as the [[World War I|First World War]] ended; the prospective [[Duchy of Lorraine|Grand Duchy of Alsace-Lorraine]] in 1917;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Times|London Times]]. ''Düsseldorfer Nachrichten'' excerpt. 1918/11/5. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and his abortive election by the ''[[Council of Lithuania|Taryba]]'' as King Mindaugas II of Lithuania in July 1918. In the event, Duke Wilhelm obtained none of these thrones.

Relying upon the ''[[Almanach de Gotha]]'' to [[Gazette#Gazette as a verb|gazette]] dynastic events, Germany's deposed heads of state continued to notify its editors of changes in family members' status and traditional titles.&lt;ref name="secrets"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gotha"/&gt; In 1919 the morganatic wife and children of [[Prince Oskar of Prussia]], the counts and countesses von Ruppin, were upgraded to princes and princesses of Prussia by the exiled [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]]. In 1928 [[Duke Georg of Mecklenburg|Georg, Count von Carlow]], morganatic son of Duke George Alexander of Mecklenburg and commoner Natalia Vanljarskaya, became a duke of Mecklenburg and heir to his uncle [[Duke Charles Michael of Mecklenburg|Duke Charles Michael]]. In 1949, and again in 1999, various morganatic members of the [[House of Wittelsbach|Bavarian Royal House]] were recognised as princes and princesses of Bavaria, with the current head of the house, [[Franz, Duke of Bavaria]], being among the beneficiaries of his father's ruling, having been born of a marriage initially deemed morganatic.&lt;ref name="petit"&gt;de Badts de Cugnac, Chantal. Coutant de Saisseval, Guy. ''Le Petit Gotha''. Nouvelle Imprimerie Laballery, Paris 2002, p. 37 (French) {{ISBN|2-9507974-3-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the former Royal Family of Saxony [[Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen]] adopted and designated as his heir his nephew [[Prince Alexander of Saxe-Gessaphe|Alexander de Afif]], thus bypassing his [[patrilineality|agnatic]] cousin’s morganatic son, [[Prince Rüdiger of Saxony]], and his three sons.

===Luxembourg===
When the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] found itself without a male heir at the beginning of the 20th century, the morganatic [[Count of Merenberg|counts von Merenberg]] proposed themselves as heirs, being the last legitimate descendants in the [[patrilineality|male line]] of the [[House of Nassau]]. [[William IV, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke William IV]], however, chose to confirm the law of succession stipulated in 1815 by the [[Congress of Vienna]] to allow a female descendant in the Nassau male line to become successor to the throne (his own daughter [[Marie-Adélaïde, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Marie-Adélaïde]]) instead.&lt;ref name="velde"&gt;Velde, Francois.

=== Russia ===
[[Paul I of Russia]] promulgated a strict new [[house law]] for Russia in 1797, eliminating the sovereign's right to designate the heir to the throne, but requiring that dynasts be born of authorized marriages.&lt;ref name="gdukes"&gt;Beeche, Arturo.

By ''ukase'' #35731, dated 11 August 1911, Nicholas II amended the amendment, reducing application of this restriction from all members of the Imperial Family to grand dukes and grand duchesses only. This decree allowed marriages of the [[prince du sang|princes and princesses of the Blood Imperial]] with non-royal spouses, on the [[Pauline laws#Dynastic marriage|conditions]] that the emperor's consent be obtained, that the dynast renounce his or her personal succession rights, and that the Pauline laws restricting succession rights to those born of equal marriages continue in force.&lt;ref name="gdukes"/&gt;

An early victim of the Pauline laws was [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich]], grandson of [[Catherine the Great]], and viceroy of Poland. On 20 March 1820 his marriage to Princess [[Juliane of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] was annulled to allow him to morganatically wed his longtime mistress, [[Joanna Grudzińska|Countess Joanna Grudna-Grudzińska]], in Warsaw on 24 May 1820, who was elevated to the title "Princess Łowicza" upon marriage, which produced no children.&lt;ref name="gdukes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enache"&gt;Enache, Nicolas.

Beginning a novel tradition, one of that couple's daughters, Princess Olga Aleksandrovna Yurievskaya (1873–1925), in 1895 married the child of an 1868 morganatic marriage in the [[House of Nassau]], [[Count of Merenberg|George, Count von Merenberg]] (1871–1965).&lt;ref name="willis"/&gt; His mother was a daughter of renowned author [[Alexander Pushkin]] but, despite being of noble birth, she could not in 1868 dynastically marry the [[Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau|younger brother]] of a then-exiled [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Duke of Nassau]].&lt;ref name="willis"/&gt; The count filed a futile suit to establish that his morganatic status in Germany should not exclude him from succession to the [[Line of succession to the throne of Luxembourg|throne of Luxembourg]] after the last male of the [[House of Orange]], King [[William III of the Netherlands]], died in 1890 and it became apparent that the House of Nassau faced the imminent extinction of its male members, as well, upon the eventual death of [[William IV, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke William IV]].&lt;ref name="velde"/&gt; Olga's brother, [[Prince George Alexandrovich Yuryevsky|Prince George Aleksandrovich Yurievsky]] (1872–1913), in 1900 wed Countess Alexandra von Zarnekau (1883–1957), daughter of the morganatic marriage of the Russo-German [[Duke Constantine Petrovich of Oldenburg]] with Agrafena [[Japaridze (noble family)|Djaparidize]].&lt;ref name="willis"/&gt; Merenberg's sister, [[Sophie of Merenberg|Sophia]] (1868–1927), likewise contracted a morganatic marriage in 1891, with [[Grand Duke Michael Mihailovich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich of Russia]], whose cousin, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Emperor Nicholas II]] banished them to England, unwittingly saving the couple from the maelstrom of the [[Russian Revolution]] which proved fatal to so many [[House of Romanov|Romanovs]].&lt;ref name="crawf"&gt;Crawford, Rosemary and Donald.

Less fortunate among the Romanovs was [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Paul Aleksandrovich]], who went into exile in Paris to marry a commoner, [[Olga Valerianovna Paley|Olga Valerianovna Karnovich]] in 1902.&lt;ref name="gdukes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crawf"/&gt; Paul returned to serve in the Russian army during the First World War, and Nicholas II rewarded his uncle's loyalty by elevating Olga and her children as Princess and Princes Paley in 1915.&lt;ref name="crawf"/&gt; Paul's patriotism, however, sealed his fate, and he died at the hands of Russia's revolutionaries in 1919. One of his daughters, [[Irina Paley|Princess Irene Pavlovna Paley]] (1903–1990), was married while in exile in 1923, to her cousin, [[Prince Feodor Alexandrovich of Russia|Prince Theodor Aleksandrovich of Russia]], (1898-1968).&lt;ref name="crawf"/&gt;

Nicholas II forbade his brother, [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia]], from marrying twice-divorced [[Russian nobility|noblewoman]] [[Princess Brassova|Natalya Sergeyevna Wulfert]] (''née'' Sheremetevskaya), but the couple eloped abroad in 1911.&lt;ref name="crawf"/&gt; The Tsar refused his brother's request to grant the bride or their son, [[George Mikhailovich, Count Brasov|George Mikhailovich]] (1910–1931) a title, but [[legitimation|legitimated]] George and incorporated him into the [[Russian nobility]] under the surname "Brassov" in 1915: nonetheless he and his mother used the [[count|comital]] title from 1915, only being granted a princely prefix in exile by [[Cyril Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia]] in 1928.&lt;ref name="enache"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crawf"/&gt; In the throes of the First World War, Nicholas II allowed his sister [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia]] to end her loveless marriage to her social equal, [[Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg]], and quietly marry commoner Colonel [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Kulikovsky]].&lt;ref name="crawf"/&gt; Both Michael's and Olga's descendants from these marriages were excluded from the succession.

After the murder of Nicholas II and his children, the Imperial Family's morganatic marriages restricted the number of possible claimants. [[Cyril Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia|Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich]], Nicholas's cousin, proclaimed himself as Emperor in exile.&lt;ref name="gdukes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crawf"/&gt; Controversy accompanied the marriage of his son [[Vladimir Cyrillovich, Grand Duke of Russia|Grand Duke Vladimir Cyrillovich]] to [[Leonida Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia|Princess Leonida Georgievna Bagration-Mukhransky]], a descendant of the deposed Royal House of Georgia.&lt;ref name="massie"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Romanovs: The Final Chapter | publisher=Random House | author=[[Robert Massie|Massie, Robert K.]] | year=1995 | location=New York | pages=268–270 | isbn=0-394-58048-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the annexation of Georgia in 1801, Leonida's family were deemed ordinary nobility in Imperial Russia rather than royalty, leading to claims that her 1948 marriage to Vladimir (who, however, also belonged to a deposed dynasty by then) was unequal and should be considered morganatic.&lt;ref name="massie"/&gt; As a result, some factions within Russia's monarchist movement did not support the couple's daughter, [[Maria Vladimirovna, Grand Duchess of Russia|Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna]], as the rightful heir to the Romanov dynasty (see [[Line of succession to the Russian throne]] for further details of the controversy).&lt;ref name="massie"/&gt;

===Transkei===
Standards of social classification and marital rules resembling the traditions of [[dynasty#Dynasts|dynastic]] Europe can also be found in places as far afield as [[Africa]]. Here, a number of its constituent sovereign nations have legalized [[traditional authority]] as manifested in the recognized hereditary transmission of [[Tribal chief|chieftaincy]] in historically relevant regions of the continent (e.g., the [[List of rulers of Asante|Asantehene]] of [[Ghana]]). For an example of the form that morganatic unions tend to take amongst African royalty, we have only to look at the biography of the continent's favourite son: President [[Nelson Mandela]], the late leader of [[South Africa]].

Mandela, a [[nobility|nobleman]] by birth of the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] Thembus that reside in the [[Transkei]] region of the Cape coast, was nevertheless unable to ascend the throne of the ''Kumkani'' (or king) of the entire Thembu tribe, even though he descended in the legitimate, male line from the holders of this title. Nearly two centuries ago, [[Ngubengcuka]] (d. 1832), who ruled as the ''Kumkani''  of the Thembu people, married and subsequently left a son named Mandela, who became Nelson's grandfather and the source of his surname. However, because Mandela was only the [[Inkosi]]'s child by a wife of the ''Ixhiba'' lineage, a so-called "Left-Hand House", the descendants of his [[cadet branch]] of the Thembu royal family remain ineligible to succeed to the Thembu throne,&lt;ref name="mafela"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/aborig_history/indigenous_biog/mobile_devices/ch08.html|title=The revelation of African culture in Long Walk to Freedom|last=Mafela|first=Munzhedzi James|date=October 2008|work=Indigenous Biography and Autobiography|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|accessdate=18 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is itself one of the several traditional seats that are still officially recognized by South Africa's government. Instead, the Mandelas were given the [[chiefdom]] of [[Mvezo]] and made hereditary counsellors to the ''Kumkani'' (i.e., [[privy counsellor]]s) in deference to their royal ancestry. Following the loss of this chiefdom (which has since been restored to the family) in the [[Apartheid]] era, the Mandelas retained their positions as nobles of the Transkei. This status entailed, however, a degree of subjugation to the head of the dynasty, in particular in the matter of marital selection, which proved so onerous an issue to Nelson Mandela that it prompted the departure to [[Johannesburg]] that eventually led to his political career. Like the [[Battenberg family|House of Battenberg]] in Europe, Mandela's family has since rehabilitated [[Royal intermarriage#Royal intermarriage outside of Europe|its dynastic status]] to some extent: Mandela was still in prison when his daughter [[Zenani Mandela-Dlamini|Zenani]] was married to [[House of Dlamini|Prince Thumbumuzi Dlamini]] in 1973, elder brother of both King [[Mswati III of Swaziland|Mswati III]] of [[Swaziland]] and Queen [[Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu#Wives and Children|Mantfombi]], [[Great Wife]] of [[Goodwill Zwelithini]], King of the Zulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.wgbh.org/ton/programs/5069_01.html|title=Swaziland prince and princess attend Boston University|date=13 May 1987|publisher=WGBH Boston|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Travancore and Cochin ===
In the erstwhile [[princely state]] of [[Travancore]], in [[India]], the male members of the [[Travancore Royal Family]]  were, under the existing matrilineal [[Marumakkathayam]] system of inheritance and family, permitted to contract marriages with women of the [[Nair]] [[caste]] only.&lt;ref&gt;Travancore State Manual Vol ii 1940 by TK Velu Pillai&lt;/ref&gt; These were morganatic marriages called [[Sambandham]]s wherein the children gained their mother's caste and family name, due to [[Marumakkathayam]]. Although they could not inherit the throne, they did receive a title of [[nobility]], [[Thampi]] (son of the Maharajah) and Kochamma (daughter of the Maharajah). These were the members of the [[Ammaveedu]]s and their titles ensured a comfortable lifestyle and all other luxuries. The descendants of these Ammaveedu members were simply called Thampi and Thankachi and they didn't get any other distinguishing privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Travancore State Manual Vol ii 1940 by TK Velu Pillai and TSM Vol II 1906 by V Nagam Aiya&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cochin Royal family also followed the system of [[Marumakkatayam]]. Traditionally the female members of the family married Namboodiri Brahmins while male members marry ladies of the Nair caste. These wives of the male members are not royalty or didn't receive any royal titles or power, per the matrilineal system but instead get the title of Nethyar Amma. Their position ceases when the Maharaja dies. The children born to Neytharammas will be known by their mother's caste and hold no key royal titles. Currently the family marries mostly within the Kerala Kshatriya class.&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff Correspondent|title=Seeking royal roots|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/03/03/stories/2003030300550200.htm|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
{{refimprove section|date = April 2017}}
The concept of morganatic marriage has never clearly existed in any part of the [[United Kingdom]], and historically the English crown descended through marriages with commoners as late as the 17th century.  Only two of the six marriages [[Henry VIII]] made to secure an heir were with royal brides, and [[Elizabeth Woodville]], queen of [[Edward IV of England]], was also a commoner.

Another link in the English succession involving marriage with a commoner was between [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]] and [[Katherine Swynford]].  When they married after co-habiting for several years all children born previously were subsequently legitimated by Act of Parliament. [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]] later declared that they could not inherit the crown, but it is not clear that he had the right to do this. This marriage was important, as [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]] was descended from it, but Parliament still declared that he was king, so some issues remained unresolved.

As in nearly all European monarchies extant in the 21st century, most approved marriages in the [[British Royal Family]] are with untitled commoners&lt;ref name="willis"2&gt;Willis, Daniel A., ''The Descendants of King George I of Great Britain'', Clearfield Company, Baltimore, 2002, pp. 48-54 and ''passim''. {{ISBN|0-8063-5172-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and have been for several generations. In 1923 the future [[George VI]] (then second in line to the throne as [[Duke of York]]), was the first future English monarch to marry a non-princess or prince since 1659 when the future [[James II]] eloped with [[Anne Hyde]]. Wives of British peers are entitled to use the feminine form of their husbands' peerages under [[English common law]], while wives of royal princes share their husbands' styles by custom unless the Sovereign formally objects.&lt;ref name="highness"&gt;[[Donald Somervell, Baron Somervell of Harrow|Somervell, Sir Donald]]. Memorandum, Attorney General to Home Secretary, 14 April 1937, [[National Archives]] file [[Home Office|HO]] 144/22945.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Catherine Middleton]], a commoner, became the [[Duchess of Cambridge]] upon her marriage on 29 April 2011 to [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]], who had been created [[Duke of Cambridge]] that morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Introducing the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/04/29/introducing-the-duke-and-duchess-of-cambridge/?xid=rss-politics-huffpo | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla Parker Bowles]], second wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]], legally holds the title "[[Princess of Wales]]" but at the time that the engagement was announced it was declared that she would be known by the title "[[Duchess of Cornwall]]" and, in Scotland, [[Duchess of Rothesay]] (derived from other titles her husband holds as [[heir apparent]]) in deference, it has been reported, to public feelings about the title's previous holder, the Prince's first wife [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana Spencer]]. It was simultaneously stated that at such time, if any, that her husband accedes to the throne, she will be known as "[[Princess Consort]]" rather than "Queen", although as the king's wife she would legally be queen.&lt;ref name = "noqueen"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page5559.asp|title=TRH The Prince of Wales &amp; The Duchess of Cornwall|accessdate = 2009-01-11|work = The Royal Family|quote = After the wedding, Mrs. Parker Bowles became known as HRH The Duchess of Cornwall.

==== Edward VIII &amp; Wallis Simpson ====

On 16 November 1936 [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] informed Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] that he intended to marry the American divorcée [[Wallis Simpson]], proposing that he be allowed to do so morganatically and remain king.&lt;ref name=duke&gt;HRH The Duke of Windsor. ''A King's Story''. 1951. London: [[Cassell and Co.]], p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin expressed his belief that Mrs. Simpson would be unacceptable to the British people as queen, but agreed to take further soundings. The prospect of the marriage was rejected by the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]].&lt;ref name="Windsor"&gt;Bloch, Michael (1982). ''The Duke of Windsor's War''. London: [[Weidenfeld and Nicolson]]. {{ISBN|0-297-77947-8}}, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; The other [[British Dominions|Dominion]] governments were consulted&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; pursuant to the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], which provided in part that "any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Statute of Westminster 1931 c.4|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1081723|publisher=The UK Statute Law Database|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Taylor, A.J.P.]], ''English History, 1914-1945'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1965, p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin suggested three options to the prime ministers of the five [[Dominion]]s of which Edward was also king: [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] and the [[Irish Free State]]. The options were:

# Edward and Mrs. Simpson marry and she become queen (a royal marriage);
# Edward and Mrs. Simpson marry, but she not become queen, instead receiving some [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy title]] (a morganatic marriage); or
# [[Abdication]] for Edward and any potential heirs he might father, allowing him to make any marital decisions without further constitutional implications.

The second option had European precedents, including Edward's own maternal great-grandfather, [[Duke Alexander of Württemberg (1804–1885)|Duke Alexander of Württemberg]], but no unambiguous parallel in British constitutional history. [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] ([[Prime Minister of Canada]]), [[Joseph Lyons]] ([[Prime Minister of Australia]]) and [[J. B. M. Hertzog]] ([[Prime Minister of South Africa]]) opposed options 1 and 2. [[Michael Joseph Savage]] ([[Prime Minister of New Zealand]]) rejected option 1 but thought that option 2 "might be possible&amp;nbsp;... if some solution along these lines were found to be practicable" but "would be guided by the decision of the Home government".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the majority of the Commonwealth's prime ministers agreed that there was "no alternative to course (3)".&lt;ref&gt;[[Éamon de Valera]] quoted in Bradford, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 November, Baldwin consulted the three leading opposition politicians in Britain: [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] [[Clement Attlee]], [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] leader [[Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso|Sir Archibald Sinclair]] and [[Winston Churchill]]. Sinclair and Attlee agreed that options 1 and 2 were unacceptable and Churchill pledged to support the government.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters and diaries of working-class people and ex-servicemen generally demonstrate support for the King, while those from the middle and upper classes tend to express indignation and distaste.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Williams, pp. 138–144&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'', ''[[The Morning Post]]'', the ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'', and newspapers owned by [[Gomer Berry, 1st Viscount Kemsley|Lord Kemsley]], such as ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', opposed the marriage. On the other hand, the ''[[Daily Express|Express]]'' and ''[[Daily Mail|Mail]]'' newspapers, owned by [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] and [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]], respectively, appeared to support a morganatic marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Beaverbrook, p. 68; Broad, p. 188 and Ziegler, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; The King estimated that the newspapers in favour had a circulation of 12.5&amp;nbsp;million, and those against had 8.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 308 and the Duke of Windsor, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;

Backed by Churchill and Beaverbrook, Edward proposed to broadcast a speech indicating his desire to remain on the throne or to be recalled to it if forced to abdicate, while marrying Mrs Simpson morganatically. In one section, Edward proposed to say:
{{quote|Neither Mrs. Simpson nor I have ever sought to insist that she should be queen. All we desired was that our married happiness should carry with it a proper title and dignity for her, befitting my wife. Now that I have at last been able to take you into my confidence, I feel it is best to go away for a while, so that you may reflect calmly and quietly, but without undue delay, on what I have said.&lt;ref&gt;The Duke of Windsor, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Baldwin and the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]] blocked the speech, saying that it would shock many people and would be a grave breach of constitutional principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2707489.stm|first=Dominic|last=Casciani|publisher=BBC News|title=King's abdication appeal blocked|date=30 January 2003|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, Edward decided to give up the throne for "the woman I love,"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Edward VIII|title=Broadcast after his abdication, 11&amp;nbsp;December 1936|publisher=Official website of the British monarchy|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/pdf/edwardviii.pdf |accessdate=1 May 2010|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon he and his descendants were deprived of all right to the Crown by Parliament's passage of [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]]. He was created [[Duke of Windsor]] on 8 March 1937 by his brother, the new [[George VI]]. He would marry Wallis Simpson in France on 3 June 1937, after her second divorce became final. In the meantime, however, [[letters patent]] dated 27 May 1937, which re-conferred upon the Duke of Windsor the "title, style, or attribute of [[Royal Highness]]", specifically stated that "his wife and descendants, if any, shall not hold said title or attribute". This decree was issued by the new king and unanimously supported by the Dominion governments,&lt;ref&gt;Diary of [[Neville Chamberlain]] quoted in Bradford, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; The king's authority to withhold from the lawful wife of a prince the attribute hitherto accorded to the wives of other modern British princes was addressed by the Crown's legal authorities: On 14 April 1937, [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] Sir [[Donald Somervell, Baron Somervell of Harrow|Donald Somervell]] submitted to [[Home Secretary]] Sir [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]] a memorandum summarising the views of [[Lord Advocate]] [[Thomas Cooper, 1st Baron Cooper of Culross|T. M. Cooper]], [[Parliamentary Counsel]] Sir Granville Ram, and himself:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#We incline to the view that on his abdication the Duke of Windsor could not have claimed the right to be described as a Royal Highness. In other words, no reasonable objection could have been taken if the King had decided that his exclusion from the lineal succession excluded him from the right to this title as conferred by the existing Letters Patent.
#The question however has to be considered on the basis of the fact that, for reasons which are readily understandable, he with the express approval of His Majesty enjoys this title and has been referred to as a Royal Highness on a formal occasion and in formal documents. In the light of precedent it seems clear that the wife of a Royal Highness enjoys the same title unless some appropriate express step can be and is taken to deprive her of it.
#We came to the conclusion that the wife could not claim this right on any legal basis. The right to use this style or title, in our view, is within the prerogative of His Majesty and he has the power to regulate it by Letters Patent generally or in particular circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Attorney General to Home Secretary (14 April 1937) National Archives file HO 144/22945&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The new King's firm view, that the Duchess should not be given a royal title, was shared by Queen Mary and George's wife, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2003/january30/edward_duke.htm|title=Home Office memo on the Duke and Duchess's title|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=2 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231024432/http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2003/january30/edward_duke.htm|archivedate=31 December 2010|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt; The Duchess bitterly resented the denial of the royal title and the refusal of the Duke's relatives to accept her as part of the family.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;[[Philip Ziegler|Ziegler, Philip]] (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38277 "Windsor, (Bessie) Wallis, duchess of Windsor (1896–1986)"], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/38277}}, retrieved 2 May 2010 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also, {{citation|last=Bloch|first=Michael (ed.)|title=Wallis and Edward: Letters 1931–1937|publisher=[[Summit Books]]|year=1986|isbn=0-671-61209-3|pages=231, 233}} cited in Bradford, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days of George VI's reign the Duke telephoned daily, importuning for money and urging that the Duchess be granted the style of Royal Highness, until the harassed King ordered that the calls not be put through.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; However, within the household of the Duke and Duchess, the style "Her Royal Highness" was used by those who were close to the couple.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

==== James II &amp; Anne Hyde ====

It has been suggested that [[William III of England|William, Prince of Orange]], expected to have a strong claim to the throne of [[England]] after the [[James II of England|Duke of York]] during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der zee and Van der zee, 1688: ''A Revolution in the family''. Viking, Great Britain: 1988. p 52&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the Duke's two daughters from his first marriage, [[Queen Mary II of England|Princess Mary]] and [[Queen Anne of Great Britain|Princess Anne]], were considered to have the stronger claim by the English establishment. William's expectation was based on the continental practice of morganatic marriage, since the mother of both princesses, [[Anne Hyde]], was a commoner and a lady-in-waiting to William's mother, [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Princess Mary]]. It was through his mother, a sister of Charles II and the Duke of York, that William claimed the throne, because, to his mind, the son of a princess had a stronger claim than the daughter of a commoner. It was to shore up his own claim to the throne that he agreed to marry his first cousin, Princess Mary. When James II fled at the [[Glorious Revolution]], William refused to accept the title of [[king consort]] (which [[Philip II of Spain]] had been granted under [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] in the 1550s) and insisted on being named King in his own right. The compromise solution involved naming both to the crown as had rarely happened in the past (see for example [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] and his son [[Henry the Young King|Young King Henry]], who ruled England simultaneously).

==== Morganatic vs. invalid ====

The [[Royal Marriages Act of 1772]] made it illegal for all persons born into the [[British royal family]] to marry without the permission of the sovereign, and any marriage contracted without the sovereign’s consent was considered invalid. This led to several prominent cases of British princes who had gone through marriage ceremonies, and who [[cohabit]]ed with their partners as if married,{{cn|date=February 2018}} but whose relationships were not legally recognised. As a result, their partners and children (the latter considered illegitimate) held no titles, and had no succession rights. This differs from morganatic marriages, which are considered legally valid.

The '''non-aggression principle''' (or '''NAP'''; also called the '''non-aggression axiom''', the '''anti-coercion''', '''zero aggression principle''' or '''non-initiation of force''') is an [[ethics|ethical]] stance asserting that [[aggression]] is inherently wrong. In this context, "aggression" is defined as initiating or threatening any ''forcible'' interference with an individual or individual's property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Long|first=Roderick |authorlink=Roderick T.

The NAP is considered by some to be a defining principle of [[natural-rights libertarianism]].

==History==
The non-aggression principle has existed in various forms. Although the principle has been traced back as far as antiquity, it was first formally described by this name by the [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] philosopher [[Ayn Rand]], and then further popularized by [[libertarianism|libertarian]] thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libertyunbound.com/sites/files/printarchive/Liberty_Magazine_January_2005.pdf |title= Freedom: What’s Right vs What Works (Liberty Magazine, January 2005, Vol 15 No 1, pp. 31–39) |author1=Charles Murray |author2=David Friedman |author3=David Boaz |author4=R.W.

|[[John Locke]]
|Locke gives the following version of the NAP: "Being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Principle_of_non-aggression#Historical_formulations_and_background |title=Principle of Non-Aggression |publisher=[[The Mises Institute]] | accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Thomas Jefferson]]
|Jefferson describes the NAP in a letter to Francis Gilmer: "Rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add 'within the limits of the law', because law is often but the tyrant's will, and always so when it violates the rights of the individual." and "No man has a natural right to commit aggression on the equal rights of another, and this is all from which the laws ought to restrain him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Principle_of_non-aggression#Historical_formulations_and_background |title=Principle of Non-Aggression |author=Thomas Jefferson | accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tjrs.monticello.org/letter/1380 |title=Extract from Thomas Jefferson to Francis Walker Gilmer, 7 June 1816 | author=Thomas Jefferson |publisher=Thomas Jefferson Foundation |work=Jefferson Quotes &amp;amp; Family Letters |accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[John Stuart Mill]]
|In his book ''[[On Liberty]]'' Mill states the NAP as follows: "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Principle_of_non-aggression#Historical_formulations_and_background |title=Principle of Non-Aggression |author=John Stuart Mill | accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|1923
|[[Albert Jay Nock]]
|In the second chapter of his book, [[Our Enemy, the State]], Nock refers to an ancient formulation of the NAP by the legendary king Pausole, who stated it as two laws.

|[[Ayn Rand]]
|In an essay called "Man's Rights" in the book ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]'' she formulated "The precondition of a civilized society is the barring of physical force from social relationships. ...

|[[Murray Rothbard]]
|"No one may threaten or commit violence ('aggress') against another man's person or property. Violence may be employed only against the man who commits such violence; that is, only defensively against the aggressive violence of another. In short, no violence may be employed against a nonaggressor. Here is the fundamental rule from which can be deduced the entire corpus of libertarian theory." Cited from "War, Peace, and the State" (1963) which appeared in ''[[Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard26.html |title=War, Peace, and the State (April 1963) |author=Murray N.

|}

==Justifications==
The principle has been derived by various philosophical approaches, including:
* [[Argumentation ethics]]: Some modern libertarian thinkers ground the non-aggression principle by an appeal to the necessary [[praxeology|praxeological]] [[presuppositions]] of any ethical discourse, an argument pioneered by libertarian scholar [[Hans Hermann Hoppe]]. They claim that the act of arguing for the initiation of aggression, as defined by the non-aggression principle is [[performative contradiction|contradictory]]. Among these are [[Stephan Kinsella]]&lt;ref name="KinsellaNAP&amp;PR2011"/&gt; and [[Murray Rothbard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard47.html |title=Hoppephobia (2004 LewRockwell.com reprint from Liberty, Vol. 3 No. 4, March 1990, pp. 11–12.) |author=Murray N. Rothbard |accessdate=2012-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Consequentialism]]: Some advocates base the non-aggression principle on [[rule utilitarianism]] or [[rule egoism]]. These approaches hold that though violations of the non-aggression principle cannot be claimed to be objectively immoral, adherence to it almost always leads to the best possible results, and so it should be accepted as a moral rule. These scholars include [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Review Article: The New Liberalism|journal=British Journal of Political Science| volume= 13|issue= 1|date= January 1993|pages= 93–123) |author=Norman P. Barry |jstor = 193781|doi=10.1017/s000712340000315x}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=October 2012}}
* [[Christian worldview]]: There is an emerging Biblical argument that the ''natural rights'' of Locke, Rothbard and others are most truly derived from the Biblical principles of ''self-stewardship'' and the ''image of God in man''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} (In contrast, some [[Ethics in religion|ethicists]]&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite book |last=Koehn |first=Daryl |year=2005 |title=The nature of evil |location=New York |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |pages=3–8 |isbn=1403968942 |oclc=56064628 |doi=10.1057/9781403979377 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUfHAAAAQBAJ}} And: {{cite book |editor-last=Schweiker |editor-first=William |editor-link=William Schweiker |year=2005 |title=The Blackwell companion to religious ethics |location=Malden, MA |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |isbn=0631216340 |oclc=55008191 |doi=10.1002/9780470997031 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XK2kQJqyXdEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anthropology of religion|anthropologists of religion]]&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite book |editor1-last=Waal |editor1-first=Frans B.

The rights to life, liberty and property derive from the fact that God has granted each person to be the steward of himself and none other, granting him the human authority to manage his own life and property, which morally requires him to do so according to God's Law, but civilly requires him to respect the dignity and property rights of his neighbor. The Biblical purpose of civil government is to serve on behalf of individuals who have had their life, liberty, or property violated by another.
* [[Natural rights]]: Some derive the non-aggression principle [[deontology|deontologically]] by appealing to rights that are independent of civil or social convention. Such approaches often reference [[self-ownership]], [[ethical intuitionism]], or the [[right to life]]. Thinkers in the natural law tradition include [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Murray Rothbard]], and [[Robert Nozick]].
* [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]: [[Ayn Rand]] rejected natural or inborn rights theories as well as supernatural claims and instead proposed a philosophy based on observable reality along with a corresponding ethics based on the factual requirements of human life in a social context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2013-winter/libertarianism-vs-radical-capitalism.asp |title= Libertarianism vs. Radical Capitalism (The Objective Standard, Vol. 8 No. 4, Winter 2013-2014) | author=Craig Biddle |accessdate=2013-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She stressed that the political principle of non-aggression is not a primary and that it only has validity as a consequence of a more fundamental philosophy. For this reason, many of her conclusions differ from others who hold the NAP as an axiom or arrived at it differently. She proposed that man survives by identifying and using concepts in his rational mind since "no sensations, percepts, urges or instincts can do it; only a mind can." She wrote, "since reason is man's basic means of survival, that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good; that which negates, opposes or destroys it [i.e. initiatory force or fraud] is the evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ari_ayn_rand_the_objectivist_ethics |title= The Objectivist Ethics (The Virtue of Selfishness, 1961) | author=Ayn Rand |accessdate=2012-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitional issues==

===Abortion===
Many supporters and opponents of abortion rights justify their position on NAP grounds. One important question to determine whether or not abortion is consistent with NAP is at what stage of development a fertilized human egg cell can be considered a [[human being]] with the status and rights attributed to [[personhood]]. Some supporters of NAP argue this occurs at the moment of conception. Others argue that since they believe the fetus lacks [[sentience]] until a certain stage of development, it does not qualify as a human being, and as such may be considered property of the mother. Opponents of abortion, on the other hand, state sentience is not a qualifying factor. They refer to the [[Non-aggression principle#Non-humans|animal rights]] discussion and point out the ''[[Argument from marginal cases]]'' that concludes NAP also applies to non-sentient (i.e. mentally handicapped) humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libertarianfaq.org/index.php?title=Are_libertarians_pro_choice_or_pro_life%3F |title=Are libertarians pro choice or pro life? (Libertarian FAQ Wikipage, January 2, 2010) |author=Various authors |accessdate=2011-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important question is whether an unwelcome fetus should be considered to be an unauthorized trespasser in its mother's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.str.org/articles/trespassing-in-the-womb#.VXIUO0aRzak|title=Trespassing in the Womb - Stand to Reason|author=|date=|website=www.str.org|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The non-aggression principle does not protect trespassers from the owners of the property on which they are trespassing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c4ss.org/content/13144|title=Is Property Theft?|author=|date=|website=c4ss.org|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be argued that unwelcome fetuses are themselves committing aggression against their mothers, by taking materials (oxygen, water, nutrients) from her bloodstream, by injecting toxic metabolic end-products (carbon dioxide and creatinine) into her bloodstream, and by preparing to subject her to major medical/surgical trauma in the form of full-term labor and delivery.

[[Objectivist movement|Objectivist]] philosopher [[Leonard Peikoff]] has argued that a fetus has no right to life inside the womb because it is not an "independently existing, biologically formed organism, let alone a person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peikoff.com/essays_and_articles/abortion-rights-are-pro-life/ |title=Abortion Rights are Pro-Life |author=Leonard Peikoff |accessdate=2011-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-choice libertarian [[Murray Rothbard]] held the same stance, maintaining that abortion is justified at any time during pregnancy if the fetus is no longer welcome inside its mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/rothbard/newlibertywhole.asp#p94 |title=For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto (1973, 1978, 2002 online ed, Chapter 6) |author=Murray N. Rothbard |accessdate=2011-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, other pro-choice supporters base their argument on criminal trespass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libertarianpapers.org/articles/2010/lp-2-32.pdf |title=Rejoinder to Wisniewski on Abortion (Libertarian Papers Vol. 2, Art. No. 32, 2010) |author=Walter Block |accessdate=2011-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, they claim, NAP is not violated when the fetus is forcibly removed, with deadly force if need be, from the mother’s body, just as NAP is not violated when an owner removes from the owner’s property an unwanted visitor who is not willing to leave voluntarily. Libertarian theorist [[Walter Block]] follows this line of argument but makes a distinction between evicting the fetus prematurely so that it dies and actively killing it (see ''[[Libertarian perspectives on abortion#Other positions|Libertarian perspectives on abortion]]'').

[[Libertarians for Life|Pro-life libertarians]], however, argue that because the parents were actively involved in creating a new human life and that life has not consented to his or her own existence, that life is in the womb by necessity and no parasitism or trespassing is involved (see also legal [[necessity (criminal law)|necessity]]). They state that as the parents are responsible for that life's position, NAP would be violated when that life is killed with abortive techniques.

===Intellectual property rights===
NAP is defined as applicable to any unauthorized actions towards a person’s ''physical'' property. Supporters of NAP disagree on whether it should apply to [[Libertarian perspectives on intellectual property|intellectual property (IP)]] rights as well as physical property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/libhe/libhe014.htm |title=Intellectual Property: The Late Nineteenth Century Libertarian Debate (Libertarian Alliance, 1995, ISBN 1-85637-281-2) |author=Wendy McElroy |accessdate=2011-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that because intellectual concepts are non-[[Rivalry (economics)|rivalrous]], intellectual property rights are unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/15_2/15_2_1.pdf |title=Against Intellectual Property (Journal of Libertarian Studies, Vol. 15, No. 2, Spring 2001, pp. 1–53) |author=N. Stephan Kinsella |accessdate=2011-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others argue that intellectual property rights are as valid and important as physical ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lysanderspooner.org/intellect/contents.htm |title=The Law of Intellectual Property: An Essay on the Right of Authors and Inventors to a Perpetual Property in Their Ideas (Bella Marsh, Boston, 1855) |author=Lysander Spooner |accessdate=2011-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interventions===
Though NAP is meant to guarantee an individual’s sovereignty, libertarians greatly differ on the conditions under which NAP applies.

===States===
Some libertarians justify the existence of a [[minarchism|minimal]] [[state (polity)|state]] on the grounds that [[anarchism]] implies that the non-aggression principle is optional because the enforcement of laws is open to competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/areed2/LongXXXMachan.pdf |title=Anarchism/Minarchism: Is a Government Part of a Free Country?

[[Anarcho-capitalism|Anarcho-capitalists]] usually respond to this argument that this presumed outcome of coercive competition (e.g. [[Private military company|PMCs]] or [[Private defense agency|PDAs]] that enforce [[Polycentric law|local law]]) is not likely because of the very high cost, in lives and economically, of war. They claim that war drains those involved and leaves non-combatant parties as the most powerful, economically and militarily, ready to take over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/legan/legan016.pdf |title=Privately Produced Law (Libertarian Alliance reprint, 1991, ISBN 1-85637-053-4) |author=Tom W.

Anarcho-capitalists aligned with the [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbardian]] philosophy generally contend that the state violates the non-aggression principle by its very nature because, it is argued, governments necessarily use force against those who have not [[theft|stolen private property]], [[vandalism|vandalized private property]], [[assault|assaulted anyone]], or [[fraud|committed fraud]].&lt;ref name="MolyneuxTSS2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://praxeology.net/Anarconst2.pdf|title=Market Anarchism as Constitutionalism (Anarchism/Minarchism, 2008, Chapter 9) |author=Roderick T.

===Taxation===
Proponents of the NAP see [[taxation|taxes]] as a [[Taxation as theft|violation of NAP]], while critics of the NAP argue that because of the [[free-rider problem]] in case security is a [[public good]], enough funds would not be obtainable by voluntary means to protect individuals from aggression of a greater severity. The latter therefore accept taxation, and consequently a breach of NAP with regard to any free-riders, as long as no more is levied than is necessary to [[consequentialism|optimise protection of individuals against aggression]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Geolibertarians]], who following the [[classical economics|classical economists]] and [[Georgism|Georgists]] adhere to the [[John Locke|Lockean]] [[labor theory of property]], argue that [[land value tax]]ation is fully compatible with the NAP.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

[[Anarcho-capitalism|Anarcho-capitalists]] argue that the protection of individuals against aggression is self-sustaining like any other valuable service, and that it can be supplied without coercion by the [[free market]] much more effectively and efficiently than by a [[government monopoly]].&lt;ref name="libertarianpapers"&gt;[http://libertarianpapers.org/articles/2011/lp-3-3.pdf "Review of Kosanke's Instead of Politics – Don Stacy"] Libertarian Papers Vol. 3, Art.

Supporters of the NAP often appeal to it in order to argue for the immorality of [[theft]], [[vandalism]], [[assault]], and [[fraud]]. Compared to [[nonviolence]], the non-aggression principle does not preclude violence used in [[self-defense]] or defense of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archive.lewrockwell.com/block/block26.html |title= The Non-Aggression Axiom of Libertarianism (LewRockwell.com, February 17, 2003) | author=Walter Block |accessdate=2011-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many supporters argue that NAP opposes such policies as [[victimless crime]] laws, [[taxation]], and [[military draft]]s. NAP is the foundation of libertarian philosophy.&lt;ref name=KinsellaNAP&amp;PR2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.mises.org/18608/the-relation-between-the-non-aggression-principle-and-property-rights-a-response-to-division-by-zer0/ |title=The relation between the non-aggression principle and property rights (Mises Economics Blog, October 4, 2011) |author=Stephan Kinsella |accessdate=2011-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NAP faces two kinds of criticism: the first holds that the principle is immoral, and the second argues that it is impossible to apply consistently in practice; respectively, [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] or [[Deontological ethics|deontological]] criticisms, and [[Consistent|inconsistency]] criticisms. Libertarian academic philosophers have noted the implausible results consistently applying the principle yields: for example, Professor Matt Zwolinski notes that, because pollution necessarily violates the NAP by encroaching (even if slightly) on other people's property, consistently applying the NAP would prohibit driving, starting a fire, and other activities necessary to the maintenance of industrial society.&lt;ref name="Matt Zwolinski"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libertarianism.org/blog/six-reasons-libertarians-should-reject-non-aggression-principle|title=Six Reasons Libertarians Should Reject the Non-Aggression Principle |author=Matt Zwolinski |accessdate=2014-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral criticisms===
{{Main article|Morality}}

====NAP does not allow for positive rights====
Critics argue that the non-aggression principle is not ethical because it opposes the initiation of force even when they would consider the results of such initiation to be morally superior to the alternatives that they have identified. In arguing against the NAP, philosopher Matt Zwolinski has proposed the following scenario: "Suppose that by imposing a very, very small tax on billionaires, I could provide life-saving vaccination for tens of thousands of desperately poor children. Even if we grant that taxation is aggression, and that aggression is generally wrong, is it really so obvious that the relatively minor aggression involved in these examples is wrong, given the tremendous benefit it produces?"&lt;ref name="Matt Zwolinski"/&gt;

====Incompatibility with driving and other civilizational necessities====
Zwolinski also notes that the NAP is incompatible with any practice that produces any pollution, because pollution encroaches on the property rights of others. Therefore, the NAP prohibits both driving and starting fires. Citing Professor [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]], Professor Zwolinski notes that the NAP is unable to place a sensible limitation on risk-creating behavior. Writes Zwolinski,

{{quote|Of course, almost everything we do imposes some risk of harm on innocent persons. We run this risk when we drive on the highway (what if we suffer a heart attack, or become distracted), or when we fly airplanes over populated areas. Most of us think that some of these risks are justifiable, while others are not, and that the difference between them has something to do with the size and likelihood of the risked harm, the importance of the risky activity, and the availability and cost of less risky activities. But considerations like this carry zero weight in the NAP’s absolute prohibition on aggression. That principle seems compatible with only two possible rules: either all risks are permissible (because they are not really aggression until they actually result in a harm), or none are (because they are). And neither of these seems sensible.}}

====Innocent persons problem====
Some critics use the example of the [[trolley problem]] to invalidate NAP. In case of the runaway trolley, headed for five victims tied to the track, NAP does not allow a trolley passenger to flip the switch that diverts the trolley to a different track if there is a person tied to that track. That person would have been unharmed if nothing was done, therefore by flipping the switch NAP is violated. Another example often cited by critics is [[human shield]]s.

Some supporters argue that no one initiates force if their only option for self-defense is to use force against a greater number of people as long as they were not responsible for being in the position they are in. [[Murray Rothbard]]'s and [[Walter Block]]'s formulations of NAP avoid these objections by either specifying that the NAP applies only to a civilized context (and not 'lifeboat situations') or that it applies only to legal rights (as opposed to general morality). Thus a starving man may, in consonance with general morality, break into a hunting cabin and steal food, but nevertheless he is aggressing, i.e. violating the NAP, and (by most rectification theories) should pay compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/daily/1628 |title=Lifeboat Situations (The Ethics of Liberty, 1982, Chapter 20) |author=Murray N. Rothbard |accessdate=2011-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that the legal rights approach might allow people who can afford to pay a [[sufficiently large]] amount of [[Blood money (restitution)|compensation]] to get away with murder. They point out that [[Polycentric law|local law]], though based on NAP, may vary from proportional compensation to capital punishment to no compensation at all.&lt;ref name="FriedmanMOF1989"/&gt;

====Non-physical aggression====
Other critics state that the NAP is unethical because it does not provide for the violent prohibition of, and thereby supposedly legitimizes, several forms of aggression that do not involve intrusion on property rights, such as verbal&lt;!--Physical sexual harassment (e.g., unwanted touching) unambiguously violates the nonaggression axiom.--&gt; [[sexual harassment]], [[defamation]], [[boycott]]ing, noninvasive&lt;!--Invasive striking (e.g., sitdown striking without the consent of the owner (provided ownership was obtained and maintained legitimately)) unambiguously violates the nonaggression axiom.--&gt; [[labour strike|striking]], and noninvasive&lt;!--Invasive discrimination (e.g., burning crosses on another's property without the owner's consent) unambiguously violates the nonaggression axiom.--&gt; [[discrimination]].&amp;nbsp; If a victim thus provoked would turn to physical violence, according to the NAP, he would be labeled an aggressor.&amp;nbsp; Supporters of the NAP, however, state that boycotting&lt;ref name="boycott-FANL"&gt;[[Murray N.

I do not think there are any other conditions to free speech. I've got a right to say and believe anything I please, but I have not got a right to press it on anybody else. [...] Nobody's got a right to be a nuisance to his neighbors.| Mencken (1880–1956) in a 1948 interview with Donald H. Kirkley for the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.infinitemonkeysblog.com/?q=node/7319 |title=Fred Phelps, Freedom of Speech and 'the Last Limits of the Endurable' (Ben’s Blog on Infinite Monkeys, Fri, 10/08/2010) |author=Ben’s Blog |accessdate=2011-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Inconsistency criticisms===
{{Main article|Applied ethics}}

====Natural resources and environmental pollution====
Critics argue it is not possible to uphold NAP when protecting the [[Natural environment|environment]] as most [[pollution]] can never be traced back to the party that caused it. They therefore claim that only general broad government regulations will be able to protect the environment. Supporters cite the problem of the [[tragedy of the commons]] and argue that [[free-market environmentalism]] will be much more effective in conserving nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj2n1/cj2n1-2.pdf |title=Law, Property Rights, and Air Pollution (Cato Journal, Vol. 2, No. 1, Spring 1982, pp. 55–99) |author=Murray N. Rothbard |accessdate=2011-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911075448/http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj2n1/cj2n1-2.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libertarianpapers.org/articles/2011/lp-3-10.pdf |title=Free Markets, Property Rights and Climate Change: How To Privatize Climate Policy (Libertarian Papers, Vol. 3, No. 10, 2011, pp. 1–29) |author=Graham Dawson |accessdate=2011-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Political theorist [[Hillel Steiner]] emphasizes that all things made come from natural resources and that the validity of any rights to those made things depends on the validity of the rights to the natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2012/04/left-libertarianism-and-the-ownership-of-natural-resources/ |title=Left-Libertarianism and the Ownership of Natural Resources (Bleeding Heart Libertarians, April 24, 2012) |author=Hillel Steiner |accessdate=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If land was stolen then anyone buying produce from that land would not be the legitimate owner of the goods. Also, if natural resources cannot be privately owned but are, and always will be, the property of all of mankind then NAP would be violated if such a resource would be used without everybody’s consent (see the [[Lockean proviso]] and [[free-market anarchism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2012/04/natural-rights-and-natural-stuff/ |title=Natural Rights and Natural Stuff (Bleeding Heart Libertarians, April 23, 2012) |author=Eric Mack |accessdate=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian philosopher [[Roderick Long]] points out that, as natural resources are required not only for the production of goods but for the production of the human body as well, the very concept of [[self-ownership]] can only exist if the land itself is privately owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2012/04/self-ownership-and-external-property/ |title=Self-Ownership and External Property (Bleeding Heart Libertarians, April 25, 2012) |author=Roderick Long |accessdate=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of NAP as an absolute, rather than relative, concept====
[[Consequentialist libertarianism|Consequentialist libertarian]] [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]], who believes that the NAP should be understood as a relative rather than absolute principle, defends his view by using a [[Sorites argument]]. Friedman begins by stating what he considers obvious: A neighbor aiming his flashlight at someone's property is not aggression, or if it is, it is only aggression in a trivial technical sense. However, aiming at the same property with a gigawatt laser is certainly aggression by any reasonable definition. Yet both flashlight and laser shine photons onto the property, so there must be some cutoff point of how many photons one is permitted to shine upon a property before it is considered aggression. But the cutoff point cannot be found by deduction alone, because of the [[Sorites paradox]], so the non-aggression principle is necessarily ambiguous. Friedman points out the difficulty of undertaking any activity that poses a certain amount of risk to third parties (e.g. flying) if the permission of thousands of people that might be affected by the activity is required.&lt;ref name=FriedmanMOF1989_ii&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Libertarian/Machinery_of_Freedom/MofF_Chapter_41.html |title=Problems (The Machinery of Freedom, 1989, Chapter 41) |author=David D.

'''Noogenesis''' is the emergence and evolution of [[intelligence]].&lt;ref name=wordinfo&gt;[http://wordinfo.info/unit/1410 Noogenesis // Word Info about English Vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Term origin ==
Noo, [[Nous|nous]] ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|n|aʊ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|n|uː|s}}) – from the [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|en|[[Wiktionary: νόος|νόος]]}}, has synonyms in other languages {{lang|en|[[Wiktionary: 智慧|智慧]]}} ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]), is a term that currently encompasses the semantics: [[mind]], [[intelligence]], [[intellect]], [[reason]]; [[wisdom]]; [[insight]], [[intuition]],  [[thought]], - in a single phenomenon&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles|edition=3 |page=1417|year=1973|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;See entry for ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dno%2Fos νόος]'' in [[Liddell &amp; Scott]], on the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;See entry for ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dintellectus2 intellectus]'' in [[Lewis &amp; Short]], on the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt;.

Noogenesis was first mentioned in the posthumously published in 1955 book ''[[The Phenomenon of Man]]'' by [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], an [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] and philosopher, in a few places:
{{quote|"With and within the crisis of reflection, the next term in the series manifests itself. Psychogenesis has led to man. Now it effaces itself, relieved or absorbed by another and a higher function—the engendering and subsequent development of the mind, in one word noogenesis. When for the first time in a living creature instinct perceived itself in its own mirror, the whole world took a pace forward."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; "There is only one way in which our minds can integrate into a coherent picture of noogenesis these two essential properties of the autonomous centre of all centres, and that is to resume and complement our Principle of Emergence."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; "The idea is that of noogenesis ascending irreversibly towards Omega through the strictly limited cycle of a geogenesis."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; "To make room for thought in the world, I have needed to ' interiorise ' matter : to imagine an energetics of the mind; to conceive a noogenesis rising upstream against the flow of entropy ; to provide evolution with a direction, a line of advance and critical points..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; —"[[Omega point]]".}}
The lack of any kind of definition of the term has led to a variety of interpretations reflected in the book,&lt;ref&gt;Glycerio, M. L. &amp; Paulsen, J. B. (1999). Is Noogenesis Progressing? Richmond, VA.

E. Explanatory dictionary of social science terms. - Lan. — 1999. — 528 p. ({{ISBN|5-8114-0167-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; etc.
The most widespread interpretation is thought to be "the emergence of mind, which follows geogenesis, [[biogenesis]] and [[wikt:Hominization|anthropogenesis]], forming a new sphere on [[Earth]]—[[noosphere]]".

A new understanding of the term "noogenesis" as an evolution of the intellect was proposed by A. Eryomin. A hypothesis based on [[recapitulation theory]] links the evolution of the human brain to the development of human civilization. The parallel between the amount of people living on Earth and the amount of neurons becomes more and more obvious leading us to viewing global intelligence as an analogy for human brain.
All of the people living on this planet have undoubtedly inherited the amazing cultural treasures of the past, be it production, social and intellectual ones. We are genetically hardwired to be a sort of "live RAM" of the global intellectual system. Alexey Eryomin suggests that humanity is moving towards a unified self-contained informational and intellectual system.  His research has shown the probability of Super Intellect realizing itself as Global Intelligence on Earth. We could get closer to understanding the most profound patterns and laws of the Universe if these kinds of research were given enough attention. Also, the resemblance between the individual human development and such of the whole human race has to be explored further if we are to face some of the threats of the future.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://www.itogi.ru/archive/2005/26/67197.html Krivosheev S.

Therefore, generalizing and summarizing: 
{{quote|"Noogenesis—the expansion process in space and development in time (evolution) of intelligent systems (intelligent matter). Noogenesis represents a set of natural, interconnected, characterized by a certain temporal sequence of structural and functional transformations of the entire hierarchy and set of interacting among themselves on the basic structures and processes ranging from the formation and separation of the rational system to the present (the phylogenesis of the nervous systems of organisms; the evolution of humanity as [[autonomy|autonomous]] intelligent systems) or death (in the course of ontogenesis of the human brain)".&lt;ref&gt;Eryomin A.L.

== Aspects of emergence and evolution of mind ==

=== To the parameters of the phenomenon "noo", "intellectus" ===
The emergence of the human mind is considered to be one of the five fundamental phenomenons of [[emergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://global.britannica.com/science/emergence-science Emergence. Encyclopædia Britannica. 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
To understand the mind, it is necessary to determine how human thinking differs from other thinking beings. Such differences include the ability to generate calculations, to combine dissimilar concepts, to use mental symbols, and to think abstractly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nature-wonder.livejournal.com/177318.html Hauser M. The Origin of the Mind // Scientific American. - 2009. September. 301. - P. 44-51.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325141142/http://nature-wonder.livejournal.com/177318.html |date=2010-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The knowledge of the phenomenon of intelligent systems—the emergence of reason (noogenesis) boils down to:

* Emergence and evolution of the "[[Homo sapiens|sapiens]]" (phylogenesis);
* A conception of a new idea ([[insight]], [[creativity]] synthesis, [[intuition]], [[decision-making]], [[eureka (word)|eureka]]);

[[Image:Omni art performance 1984.jpg|thumb|300px|Jeffrey Milburn's first Omni Art performance installation Denver, Colorado (1984).]]
'''Omni art''' is an [[art movement]] that emerged in 1988 in [[New York City]] ([[United States]]).&lt;ref&gt;The Village Voice, 1988. Village Voice Media Group&lt;/ref&gt; Omni art followed [[Pop art]] and [[Postmodernism]] by shifting attention from social and political issues focusing on the emerging convergence of science, consciousness and art in the late 20th and early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Art and Consciousness 2008, Embracing The Journey Podcast with Karen Humphries Sallick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Boulder Weekly, Interview for performance installation "Khymera" benefit for The Boulder County AIDS Project.1999&lt;/ref&gt;

It draws from ancient [[Sanskrit]] mysticism, [[sacred geometry]], and [[Quantum field theory|theoretical quantum physics]], and its premise maintains that sentient experience is immersed in a multidimensional [[quantum field]] that can be distilled into 5 distinct yet connected planes or dimensions that together weave a Universal fabric or “cosmic soup” of existence.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Observer 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Creating an Art Style", The Omni Art Salon Episodes 1,2,3. Omni Art Salon Productions&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Soul artwork 1981 detail.jpg|thumb|300px|Milburn's "Soul" artwork (1981) in detail..]]

==The Omni art Perspective==
Within the Omni art paradigm,&lt;ref&gt;see OMNI ART - Language of Consciousness, Milburn, Jeffrey. 2007, Voice One Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; there is an ascending series of vibrational fields ranging from the most coarse in vibratory rate (the physical dimension) to the most subtle and sublime (the etheric dimension). Each of the 5 dimensions (described below) maintain environmental vibrational fields that correlate with universal particle and wave energy signatures with qualities that can be ascertained through both [[empirical]] and subjective methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Observer'', September 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OMNI ART - Language of Consciousness, Milburn, Jeffrey 2007, Voice One Publishing {{ISBN|978-1-4276-1589-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview, Colorado Daily,University of Colorado 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Omni art is concerned with exploring and expressing sentient life experiences of and within these 5-dimensional fields that exhibit powerful influences within and upon sentient and other life forms.&lt;ref&gt;Boulder Weekly Interview, Boulder Weekly 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantum physicist postulates that a wave/particle model of energy and matter substructs universal cosmology and in this way quantum physicists and Omni artists are concerned with the same observable and intuited phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;The Creation of an Art Movement,Episodes 1-3. The Omni Art Salon 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist [[Jeffrey Milburn]] postulates that these 5-dimensional vibrational particle and wave fields are experienced in the human consciousness through light and sound waves forming a 5-dimensional matrix that sustains the fabric of existence for all life in the visible and invisible universe.&lt;ref&gt;Omni Art - Language of Consciousness, Milburn, Jeffrey. Voice One Publishing 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Five Dimensions of Human Experience==
[[Image:Omni Art Book.jpg|thumb|200px|Language of Consciousness (2007) is a personal description of an art style he developed during the late 1980s and founded as a style in a groundbreaking museum installation in 1991.]]

'''The Physical Dimension''' - The [[primary vibrational field]] has the most dense oscillation pattern and energy signature manifested as matter within the physical universe.

'''The Astral Dimension''' - The [[secondary vibrational field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the physical dimension. This is where dreams, psychic cognition, human emotions, and paranormal phenomenon take place.

'''The Causal Dimension''' - The [[tertiary vibrational field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the astral dimension, and is described by many researchers as a resonant “brain” or record of all the cause-effect relationships in the universe, known in ancient [[Vedic]] texts as the [[akasha]].

'''The Mental Dimension''' - The [[quaternary vibrational field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the causal dimension. The human mind experiences this vibrational field as thoughts, ideas, concepts and connectivity.

'''The Etheric Dimension''' - The [[quinary dimensional field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the mental dimension. This is the subconscious portal to the non-dual dimensions.
This dimension acts as the gateway into non-duality or singularity and can be observed in sudden, unexplainable awareness that spontaneously appears as an "aha!", or sudden, moment of realization.

==The Universalist Group Collection==

Artist [[Jeffrey Milburn]] mounted a museum installation of the foundational collection of 12 artworks called “The Universalist Group.” in 1991 at [http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/islip_art_museum/index.html The Islip Art Museum]&lt;ref&gt;The Islip Art Museum, Islip, New York. March 1991&lt;/ref&gt; in Islip, New York. This group of 12 assemblage artworks were created over a period of 10 years beginning in 1981, and provide the basic vocabulary for the language of the Omni art style. Milburn coined this style of art “Omni art” in 1988 when he founded this nascent art movement. The Universalist Group collection has appeared in whole or in part in all of Milburn's performance installations over the last 30 years and is described in detail in his book, OMNI ART - Language of Consciousness, Milburn’s treatise regarding Omni art.

Milburn's artworks are assemblages of found objects, canvas, and paint. Milburn describes the juxtaposition of objects in his artworks as creating a gestalt “language” allowing the observer to communicate with an inner experience he describes as a “language of consciousness” that is attuned to the observer's current state of developmental awareness. In this way, each artwork serves as a catalyst for a personal inspiration or realization that mirrors what quantum physicists describe as the observer and observed duality that collapses into a singularity field. This is the same [[Omega Point|singularity]] that scientists and ancient spiritual teachers describe as “Source” or “Oneness” that is the origination point for all particles and waves that form the phenomenon of existence.

In this way, Omni art is literally defined as “God art” or “Source art” both by intentional application and [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] utilization. The term Omni was discovered by Milburn when researching terminology that would apply to this emerging art form. Milburn describes his role as one of an artist/mystic and subsequently he has come to be known as “The Oracle of Omni.”

[[Image:Omni art universalist group.jpg|205px|thumb|left|Artist's statement from a 1991 installation at The Islip Art Museum in Islip, New York.]]

===Sacred Geometry===

One of the two primary artworks from The Universalist Group collection titled “SOUL” (1981) contains many elements that are fundamental in the science of [[sacred geometry]]. Surrounding the mirror in the center circle on this art work are 5 hand cut quartz crystals in the shape of the 5 platonic solids originally discovered and articulated upon by [[Plato]].

Milburn identified these platonic solids as corresponding to the 5-dimensional vibrational fields which he deduced constitute the basic elements forming a universal cosmological structure.

This center circle area is fronted with a 3-dimensional metaform mandala projecting out from the front of the artwork also containing many sacred geometry's. Milburn discovered 16 years after creating this artwork that its basic shape reflects the geometric shape of a black hole and posited that this peculiarity pertains to the ancient [[Kabbalistic]] theory that all in the invisible universe is reflected in the visible universe - or more commonly stated as “as above, so below.” In quantum physics jargon this same cosmological structure was articulated by physicist [[David Bohm]] as an “implicate and explicate order.”

Milburn further describes this artwork as a symbolic map or representation of universal [[cosmological]] structures that integrate with emerging scientific theories of conscious human evolution.

===The Omni art Movement===
According to Milburn, conscious human evolution is intrinsic and incontrovertible and can be seen in all aspects of life.  It naturally follows that this conscious evolution can then be observed in all the arts, sciences, and cultural idioms and he coined this process “meta-evolution” as it transcends the boundaries of [[scientific materialism]]. Reaching into the invisible regions of discovery not accessible by current technology, this evolutionary phenomenon is seen by Milburn to be the definition of the Omni art movement in the widest sense.&lt;ref&gt;Creating a New Art, The Omni Art Salon Episodes 1-3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Rocky Mountain News, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;radio interview, KGNU Boulder Public Radio 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art, Public Dialogue on The Four Propositions 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Milburn states that in popular culture one can observe the contemporary appearance of this meta-evolutionary process in contemporary films, books, and videos exploring the many aspects of emerging awareness as it intersects with a popular fascination with metaphysical and [[paranormal phenomenon]].&lt;ref&gt;"Orbiting Omni Art", The Boulder Weekly 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this phenomenon such as UFO sightings, and most recently the light orbs that are appearing by the hundreds of thousands in low resolution (below 2 mega-pixels) digital photographs espoused upon in [[Miceal Ledwith]] and physicist Klaus Heinemann's 2008 book [http://books.simonandschuster.ca/Orb-Project/Klaus-Heinemann/9781582701820 The Orb Project], have captured the imaginations of millions of people around the world and show no sign of abating.

'''Orthology''' is the study of the right use of words in [[language]]. The word comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ortho''- ("correct") and -''logy'' ("science of"). This [[science]] is a place where [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], and many other fields of [[learning]] come together. The most noted use of ''Orthology'' is for the selection of words 
for the language of [[Basic English]] by the [[Orthological Institute]].

The book, ''The Meaning of Meaning'', by [[Charles Kay Ogden|C.K. Ogden]] and [[I.A. Richards]], is an important book dealing with orthology. The term ''Orthology'' comes from the book ''The Grammar of Science'' by [[Karl Pearson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Karl |first= Pearson |title= The Grammar of Science |origyear= 1893 |publisher= Walter Scott |location= London |pages=454 |quote= A fundamental part of logic is the study of the right use of language, clear definition, and, if needful, invention of terms -- ''Orthology''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parampara''' ([[Sanskrit]]: परम्परा, ''paramparā'') denotes a succession of teachers and disciples in traditional [[Vedic period|Vedic culture]] and [[Indian religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]]. It is also known as ''[[guru–shishya tradition]]'' ("succession from [[guru]] to disciple"). Each parampara belongs to a specific [[sampradaya]], and may have own [[akhara]]s and [[gurukula]]s.

The [[Sanskrit]] word literally means ''an uninterrupted row or series, order, succession, continuation, mediation, tradition''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary |author=[[Monier Monier-Williams]] |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1899 |ol=6534982M |page=587(column a) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the traditional residential form of education, the shishya remains with his or her guru as a family member and gets the education as a true learner.&lt;ref&gt;[[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] ''Srimad Bhagavatam'' 7.12.1, The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, 1976, {{ISBN|0-912776-87-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some traditions there is never more than one active master at the same time in the same ''guruparamaparya'' (lineage).&lt;ref&gt;Padoux, André. "The Tantric Guru" in David Gordon White (ed.) 2000. ''Tantra in Practice'', p. 44. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press {{OCLC|43441625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the paramparā system, knowledge (in any field) is passed down (undiluted) through successive generations. For example, division of [[Veda]] and its transfer through paramparas describes [[Bhagavata Purana]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', Canto 12, Chapter 6 "[https://sites.google.com/site/100scriptures/srimad-bhagavatam-bhagavata-purana/srimad-bhagavatam-canto-12-chapter-6 Mahārāja Parīkṣit passes away]". 47-60&lt;/ref&gt; Other fields of knowledge taught may include [[Spirituality|spiritual]], artistic ([[music]] or [[dance]]), or [[educational]].

==Three types of parampara: Deva, Rsi and Manav==
The current Acaryas, the heads of the maṭhas, trace their authority back to the four main disciples of Shankara,&lt;ref name="parampara" /&gt; and each of the heads of these four maṭhas takes the title of [[Shankaracharya]] ("the learned Shankara") after Adi Shankara.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The Advaita guru-paramparā (''Lineage of Gurus in Non-dualism'') begins with the mythological time of the '''Daiva-paramparā''', followed by the vedic seers of the '''Ṛṣi-paramparā''', and the '''Mānava-paramparā''' of historical times and personalities:&lt;ref name="parampara"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/advaita-parampara.html |title=The Advaita Vedânta Home Page&amp;nbsp;— Advaita Parampara |publisher=Advaita-vedanta.org |date=1999-05-05 |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The following [[Sanskrit]] [[verse (poetry)|Verse]] among [[Smartism|Smarthas]] provides the list of the early teachers of the [[Vedanta]] in their order:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vidya-ashramvidyaorder.org/index.V.html   Under Page: BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES ABOUT SANKARA AND GAUDAPAD]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Book: Shri Gowdapadacharya &amp; Shri Kavale Math (A Commemoration volume).

==Titles of gurus==
In paramapara, not only is the immediate guru revered, the three preceding gurus are also worshipped or revered. These are known variously as the ''kala-guru'' or as the "four gurus" and are designated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/tantra/maha/maha06.htm Mahanirvana Tantra]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Guru – the immediate guru
*Parama-guru – the guru of the Parampara or specific tradition (e.g. for the [[Sankaracharya|Śankaracharya]]s this is [[Adi Sankara|Adi Śankara]])
*Parātpara-guru – the guru who is the source of knowledge for many traditions (e.g. for the Śankaracharya's this is [[Vyasa|Vedavyāsa]])
*Parameṣṭhi-guru – the highest guru, who has the power to bestow mokṣa (usually depicted as [[Śiva|Lord Śiva]], being the highest guru)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7253">{{Probability fundamentals}}
The '''Kolmogorov axioms''' are a fundamental part of [[Andrey Kolmogorov]]'s [[probability theory]].
In it, the [[probability]] ''P'' of some [[event (probability theory)|event]] ''E'', denoted &lt;math&gt;P(E)&lt;/math&gt;, is usually defined as to satisfy these axioms.
The axioms are described below.

These assumptions can be summarised as follows: Let (Ω,&amp;nbsp;''F'',&amp;nbsp;''P'') be a [[measure space]] with  ''P''(Ω)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. Then (Ω,&amp;nbsp;''F'',&amp;nbsp;''P'') is a [[probability space]], with sample space Ω, event space ''F'' and probability measure&amp;nbsp;''P''.

An alternative approach to formalising probability, favoured by some [[Bayesian theory|Bayesians]], is given by [[Cox's theorem]].

== Axioms ==

==={{Anchor|Non-negativity}}First axiom ===
The probability of an event is a non-negative real number:
:&lt;math&gt;P(E)\in\mathbb{R}, P(E)\geq 0 \qquad \forall E \in F&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the event space. In particular, &lt;math&gt;P(E)&lt;/math&gt; is always finite, in contrast with more general [[Measure (mathematics)|measure theory]].  Theories which assign [[negative probability]] relax the first axiom.

=== {{Anchor|Unitarity|Normalization}}Second axiom ===
{{see also|Unitarity (physics)}}
This is the assumption of [[unit measure]]: that the probability that at least one of the [[elementary event]]s in the entire sample space will occur is 1.
: &lt;math&gt;P(\Omega) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

=== {{Anchor|Sigma additivity|Finite additivity|Countable additivity|Finitely additive}}Third axiom ===
This is the assumption of [[&amp;sigma;-additivity]]:
: Any [[countable]] sequence of disjoint sets (synonymous with ''[[Mutual_exclusivity|mutually exclusive]]'' events) &lt;math&gt;E_1, E_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; satisfies 
::&lt;math&gt;P\left(\bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty E_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty P(E_i).&lt;/math&gt;
Some authors consider merely [[finitely additive]] probability spaces, in which case one just needs an [[algebra of sets]], rather than a [[&amp;sigma;-algebra]].  [[Quasiprobability distribution]]s in general relax the third axiom.

== Consequences ==
From the [[Kolmogorov]] axioms, one can deduce other useful rules for calculating probabilities.

=== The probability of the empty set ===

: &lt;math&gt;P(\varnothing)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

In some cases, &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is not the only event with probability&amp;nbsp;0.

=== Monotonicity ===

: &lt;math&gt;\quad\text{if}\quad A\subseteq B\quad\text{then}\quad P(A)\leq P(B).&lt;/math&gt; 

If A is a subset of, or equal to B, then the probability of A is less than, or equal to the probability of B.

=== The numeric bound ===
It immediately follows from the monotonicity property that
: &lt;math&gt;0\leq P(E)\leq 1\qquad \forall E\in F.&lt;/math&gt;

== Proofs ==
The proofs of these properties are both interesting and insightful. They illustrate the power of the third axiom, and its interaction with the remaining two axioms. When studying [[axiomatic]] [[probability theory]], many deep consequences follow from merely these three axioms.
In order to verify the monotonicity property, we set &lt;math&gt;E_1=A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_2=B\setminus A&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\quad A\subseteq B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_i=\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i\geq 3&lt;/math&gt;. It is easy to see that the sets &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise disjoint and &lt;math&gt;E_1\cup E_2\cup\cdots=B&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, we obtain from the third axiom that
: &lt;math&gt;P(A)+P(B\setminus A)+\sum_{i=3}^\infty P(E_i)=P(B).&lt;/math&gt;
Since the left-hand side of this equation is a series of non-negative numbers, and since it converges to &lt;math&gt;P(B)&lt;/math&gt; which is finite, we obtain both &lt;math&gt;P(A)\leq P(B)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(\varnothing)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
The second part of the statement  is seen by contradiction: if &lt;math&gt;P(\varnothing)=a&lt;/math&gt; then the left hand side is not less than infinity
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=3}^\infty P(E_i)=\sum_{i=3}^\infty P(\varnothing)=\sum_{i=3}^\infty a = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{if } a=0, \\ \infty &amp; \text{if } a&gt;0. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; then we obtain a contradiction, because the sum does not exceed &lt;math&gt;P(B)&lt;/math&gt; which is finite. Thus, &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt;. We have shown as a byproduct of the proof of monotonicity that &lt;math&gt;P(\varnothing)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Further consequences ==
Another important property is:

: &lt;math&gt;P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B).&lt;/math&gt;

This is called the addition law of probability, or the sum rule.
That is, the probability that ''A'' ''or'' ''B'' will happen is the sum of the probabilities that ''A'' will happen and that ''B'' will happen, minus the probability that both ''A'' ''and'' ''B'' will happen. The proof of this is as follows:

Firstly,

:&lt;math&gt;P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B\setminus A)&lt;/math&gt; (by Axiom 3)

So,

:&lt;math&gt;P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B\setminus  (A \cap B))&lt;/math&gt; (by :&lt;math&gt;P(B \setminus A) = P(B\setminus  (A \cap B))&lt;/math&gt;).

Also, 

:&lt;math&gt;P(B) = P(B\setminus (A \cap B)) + P(A \cap B)&lt;/math&gt;

and eliminating &lt;math&gt;P(B\setminus (A \cap B))&lt;/math&gt; from both equations gives us the desired result.

An extension of the addition law to any number of sets is the [[inclusion–exclusion principle]].

Setting ''B'' to the complement ''A&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;'' of ''A'' in the addition law gives

: &lt;math&gt;P\left(A^{c}\right) = P(\Omega\setminus A) = 1 - P(A)&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the probability that any event will ''not'' happen (or the event's [[Complement_(set_theory)|complement]]) is 1 minus the probability that it will.

== Simple example: coin toss ==
Consider a single coin-toss, and assume that the coin will either land heads (H) or tails (T) (but not both).  No assumption is made as to whether the coin is fair.

We may define:

: &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \{H,T\}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;F = \{\varnothing, \{H\}, \{T\}, \{H,T\}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Kolmogorov's axioms imply that:

: &lt;math&gt;P(\varnothing) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
The probability of ''neither'' heads ''nor'' tails, is 0.

: &lt;math&gt;P(\{H,T\}) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
The probability of ''either'' heads ''or'' tails, is 1.

: &lt;math&gt;P(\{H\}) + P(\{T\}) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
The sum of the probability of heads and the probability of tails, is 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9902">'''Reflected appraisal''' is a term used in [[psychology]] to describe a person's perception of how others see and evaluate him or her. The reflected appraisal process concludes that people come to think of themselves in the way they believe others think of them (Mead, 1934; Cooley, 1902; Sullivan, 1947). This process has been deemed important to the development of a person's self-esteem, especially because it includes interaction with people outside oneself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hindman|first1=Kaci|title=What Is Reflected Appraisal?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-reflected-appraisal.htm|website=wisegeek.com|publisher=Conjecture Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered one of the main influences on the development of self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1=Kendra | last1=Cherry | url=http://psychology.about.com/od/rindex/g/reflectapp.htm | title=What Is the Reflected Appraisal Process? | website=psychology.about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Harry Stack Sullivan]] first coined the term reflected appraisal in 1953 when he published ''The Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry'', though [[Charles H. Cooley]] was the first to describe the process of reflected appraisal when he discussed his concept of the [[looking-glass self]] (1902). Although some of our self-views are gained by direct experience with our environment, most of what we know about ourselves is derived from others.

In 1979, Shrauger and Shoeneman found that rather than our [[self-concept]]s resembling the way others actually see us, our self-concepts are filtered through our perceptions and resemble how we think others see us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leary|first1=Mark R.|last2=Tangney|first2=June Price|title=Handbook of Self and Identity|date=July 13, 2005|publisher=The Guilford Press|isbn=1593852371|pages=5–6|edition=1|url=http://wat2146.ucr.edu/papers/02a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Felson (1993) explained that individuals are not very accurate in judging what others think of them. Among the causes of the discrepancy is the apprehension of others about revealing their views. At best, they may reveal primarily favorable views rather than both favorable and unfavorable views. Consistent with other research (DePaulo, Kenny, Hoover, Webb &amp; Oliver, 1987, Keny &amp; Albright, 1987), Felson found that individuals have a better idea of how groups see them than of how specific individuals see them. Presumably, individuals learn the group standards and then apply those standards. In turn, when group members judge individuals, they use the same standards that individuals originally applied to themselves. Thus we find a correspondence in self-appraisals and other’s appraisals of the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leary|first1=Mark R.|last2=Tangney|first2=June Price|title=Handbook of Self and Identity|date=July 13, 2005|publisher=The Guilford Press|isbn=1593852371|pages=5–6|edition=1|url=http://wat2146.ucr.edu/papers/02a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extent of impact ==
The extent to which reflected appraisals affect the person being appraised depends upon characteristics of the appraiser and his or her appraisal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=Sree|title=How the Self concept Develops|url=http://www.citeman.com/9591-how-the-self-concept-develops.html|website=citeman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater impact on the development of a person’s self-concept is said to occur when:
(1) the appraiser is perceived as a highly credible source
(2) the appraiser takes a very personal interest in the person being appraised 
(3) the appraisal is very discrepant with the person’s self-concept at the moment
(4) the number of confirmations of a given appraisal is high 
(5) the appraisals coming from a variety of sources are consistent and 
(6) appraisals are supportive of the person’s own beliefs about himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=Sree|title=How the Self concept Develops|url=http://www.citeman.com/9591-how-the-self-concept-develops.html|website=citeman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationships ==
Several studies have been conducted on the way reflected appraisal affects various relationships in a person's life. The idea that a person's self-concept is related to what that person perceives as another's opinion usually holds more weight with significant others. Appraisals from significant others such as parents, close friends, trusted colleagues, and other people the individual strongly admires, influences self-concept development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=Sree|title=How the Self concept Develops|url=http://www.citeman.com/9591-how-the-self-concept-develops.html|website=citeman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often has more influence than a stranger on a child's developing self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hindman|first1=Kaci|title=What Is Reflected Appraisal?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-reflected-appraisal.htm|website=wisegeek.com|publisher=Conjecture Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study of this topic has led to the realization that people sometimes tend to anticipate what will happen in the future based on a previous perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hindman|first1=Kaci|title=What Is Reflected Appraisal?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-reflected-appraisal.htm|website=wisegeek.com|publisher=Conjecture Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Families ===
Reflected appraisals are present among family members. All family members have opinions about one another and are typically less reticent to express them to each other than is the case outside of family relations. Siblings, especially, may be only too eager to give critical feedback regarding each other's behavior, appearance, social skills, and intelligence. Not all of these appraisals, of course, are equally significant for one's [[self-esteem]]. Both what is being appraised (with regard to its importance for one's self-concept) and who does the appraising, are important qualifiers. For children, on most things, the reflected appraisals of their parents may matter much more than those of their siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-Esteem|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Self-Esteem.aspx|website=encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflected appraisal has been the main process examined in studies of self-esteem within families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-Esteem|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Self-Esteem.aspx|website=encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of this research has focused on the effects of parental behavior on children's self-esteem. In general, these studies find that parental support and encouragement, responsiveness, and use of inductive control are related positively to children's self-esteem (Gecas and Seff 1990). Most of these parental variables could be considered indicators of positive reflected appraisals of the child. They are also the parental behaviors found to be associated with the development of other positive [[socialization]] outcomes in children and adolescents (such as moral development, pro-social behavior, and academic achievement).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-Esteem|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Self-Esteem.aspx|website=encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Married couples ===
In the investigation of the reflected appraisal process with newly married couples, [[social status]] derived from one’s position in the social structure also influences the appraisal process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leary|first1=Mark R.|last2=Tangney|first2=June Price|title=Handbook of Self and Identity|date=July 13, 2005|publisher=The Guilford Press|isbn=1593852371|pages=5–6|edition=1|url=http://wat2146.ucr.edu/papers/02a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spouse with the higher status (education, occupation, and income) in the marriage is more likely to not only influence their partner’s self-views, but also their partner’s views of them (Cast, Stets, &amp; Burke, 1999). Spouses with a lower status in the marriage have less influence on the self-view of their higher status counterparts or on how their higher-status counterparts view them.

Through reflected appraisals, we are also given lines to speak in everyday situations (Murial &amp; Joneward, 1971, pp.&amp;nbsp;68–100) that are sometimes so specific that some people refer to them as scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hybels|first1=Saundra|last2=Weaver II|first2=Richard L.|title=Communicating Effectively|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies|isbn=0072563974|pages=36–37|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through these scripts, we are given our lines, our gestures, and our characterizations. The scripts tell us how to act in future scenarios, and what is expected of us. Others tell us what they expect from us, how we should look, how we should behave, and how we should say our lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hybels|first1=Saundra|last2=Weaver II|first2=Richard L.|title=Communicating Effectively|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies|isbn=0072563974|pages=36–37|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-fulfilling prophecies ==
The messages we receive about ourselves during the process of reflected appraisal can become [[self-fulfilling prophecies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hybels|first1=Saundra|last2=Weaver II|first2=Richard L.|title=Communicating Effectively|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies|isbn=0072563974|pages=36–37|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pygmalion effect]], [[Rosenthal effect]], and [[observer-expectancy effect]] show that biased expectancies could affect reality and create self-fulfilling prophecies through reflected appraisal. If you were given positive reflected appraisals when you were young, you probably have a good self-concept; if the appraisals were largely negative, your self-concept may suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hybels|first1=Saundra|last2=Weaver II|first2=Richard L.|title=Communicating Effectively|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies|isbn=0072563974|pages=36–37|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3567">'''Source reduction''' is activities designed to reduce the volume, mass, or toxicity of products throughout the life cycle.  It includes the design and manufacture, use, and disposal of products with minimum toxic content, minimum volume of material, and/or a longer useful life. 

An example of source reduction is use of a [[Reusable shopping bag]] at the grocery store;  although it uses more material than a single-use [[disposable]] bag, the material per use is less. 

== Synonyms ==
[[Pollution Prevention]] (or P2) and [[Toxics use reduction]] are also called source reduction because they address the use of hazardous substances at the source.

== Procedures ==
Source Reduction is achieved through improvements in design, production, use, reuse, recycling, and through Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP).  A [[Life-cycle assessment]] is useful to help choose among several alternatives and options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zabaniotou|first=A|authorlink= |author2=Kassidi  |date=August 2003 |title= Life cycle assessment applied to egg packaging made from polystyrene and recycled paper |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=549–559 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi= 10.1016/S0959-6526(02)00076-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Source reduction in the United States==
In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Trade Commission]] offers guidance for labelling claims: "Source reduction" refers to reducing or lowering the weight, volume or toxicity of a product or package. To avoid being misleading, source reduction claims must qualify the amount of the source reduction and give the basis for any comparison that is made. These principles apply regardless of whether a term like "source reduced" is used.

The [[Massachusetts]] Toxics Use Reduction Program (TURA) offers 6 strategies to achieve source reduction:{{fact|date=June 2015}}
# Toxic chemical substitution
# Production process modification
# Finished product reformulation
# Production [[modernization]]
# Improvements in operations and maintenance
# In-process recycling of production material

In [[physics]], a '''spin network''' is a type of diagram which can be used to represent [[Quantum state|states]] and interactions between [[Particle physics|particles]] and [[Quantum field theory|fields]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. From a [[mathematical]] perspective, the diagrams are a concise way to represent [[multilinear function]]s and functions between [[representation theory|representations]] of [[matrix group]]s. The diagrammatic notation often simplifies calculation because simple diagrams may be used to represent complicated [[Function (mathematics)|functions]]. 

[[Roger Penrose]] is credited with the invention of spin networks in 1971,&lt;ref name=Penrose71/&gt; although similar diagrammatic techniques existed before his time. Spin networks have been applied to the theory of [[Quantum gravity|quantum gravity]] by [[Carlo Rovelli]], [[Lee Smolin]], [[Jorge Pullin]], [[Rodolfo Gambini]] and others. 

Spin networks can also be used to construct a particular [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] on the space of [[connection (mathematics)|connections]] which is invariant under local [[gauge transformation]]s.

== Definition ==

=== Penrose's original definition ===
A spin network, as described in Penrose (1971),&lt;ref name=Penrose71&gt;R. Penrose (1971a), "Angular momentum: an approach to combinatorial spacetime," in T. Bastin (ed.), ''Quantum Theory and Beyond'', Cambridge University Press (this paper can be found online on [[John C. Baez]]'s [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/penrose/ website]); and R. Penrose (1971b), "Applications of negative dimensional tensors," in D. J. A. Welsh (ed.), ''Combinatorial Mathematics and its Applications'' ([[Proceedings|Proc.]] [[Academic conference|Conf.]], Oxford, 1969), Academic Press, pp. 221–244, esp. p. 241 (the latter paper was presented in 1969 but published in 1971 according to Roger Penrose, [http://users.ox.ac.uk/~tweb/00001/#05 "On the Origins of Twistor Theory"] in: ''Gravitation and Geometry, a Volume in Honour of [[Ivor Robinson (physicist)|I. Robinson]]'', Biblipolis, Naples 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; is a kind of diagram in which each line segment represents the [[world line]] of a "unit" (either an [[elementary particle]] or a compound system of particles). Three line segments join at each vertex. A vertex may be interpreted as an event in which either a single unit splits into two or two units collide and join into a single unit. Diagrams whose line segments are all joined at vertices are called ''closed spin networks''. Time may be viewed as going in one direction, such as from the bottom to the top of the diagram, but for closed spin networks the direction of time is irrelevant to calculations.

Each line segment is labelled with an integer called a [[spin number]]. A unit with spin number ''n'' is called an ''n''-unit and has [[angular momentum]] ''nħ/2'', where ''ħ'' is the reduced [[Planck constant]]. For [[boson]]s, such as [[photon]]s and [[gluon]]s, ''n'' is an even number. For [[fermion]]s, such as [[electron]]s and [[quark]]s, ''n'' is odd.

Given any closed spin network, a non-negative integer can be calculated which is called the ''norm'' of the spin network. Norms can be used to calculate the [[probabilities]] of various spin values. A network whose norm is zero has zero probability of occurrence. The rules for calculating norms and probabilities are beyond the scope of this article. However, they imply that for a spin network to have nonzero norm, two requirements must be met at each vertex. Suppose a vertex joins three units with spin numbers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''. Then, these requirements are stated as:
* [[Triangle inequality]]: ''a'' must be less than or equal to ''b'' + ''c'', ''b'' less than or equal to ''a'' + ''c'', and ''c'' less than or equal to ''a'' + ''b''.
* Fermion conservation: ''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' must be an even number.
For example, ''a'' = 3, ''b'' = 4, ''c'' = 6 is impossible since 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 is odd, and ''a'' = 3, ''b'' = 4, ''c'' = 9 is impossible since 9 &gt; 3 + 4. However, ''a'' = 3, ''b'' = 4, ''c'' = 5 is possible since 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 is even, and the triangle inequality is satisfied. 
Some conventions use labellings by half-integers, with the condition that the sum ''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' must be a whole number.

=== Formal definition ===
More formally, a spin network is a (directed) [[graph theory|graph]] whose [[graph theory|edges]] are associated with [[Irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[Representations of Lie groups/algebras|representations]] of a [[Compact group|compact]] [[Lie group]] and whose [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] are associated with [[intertwiner#Representation_theory|intertwiner]]s of the edge representations adjacent to it.

A spin network, immersed into a manifold, can be used to define a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] on the space of [[Connection (mathematics)|connections]] on this manifold. One computes [[holonomy|holonomies]] of the connection along every link (closed path) of the graph, determines representation matrices corresponding to every link, multiplies all matrices and intertwiners together, and contracts indices in a prescribed way. A remarkable feature of the resulting functional is that it is invariant under local [[gauge transformation]]s.

== Usage in physics ==

=== In the context of loop quantum gravity ===
In [[loop quantum gravity]] (LQG), a spin network represents a "quantum state" of the [[gravitational field]] on a 3-dimensional [[hypersurface]]. The set of all possible spin networks (or, more accurately, "[[s-knot]]s" - that is, equivalence classes of spin networks under [[diffeomorphisms]]) is [[countable]]&lt;!-- inaccurate - diffeomorphism class? --&gt;; it constitutes a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of LQG [[Hilbert space]].

One of the key results of loop quantum gravity is [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of areas: the operator of the area ''A'' of a two-dimensional surface Σ should have a discrete [[Spectrum of a matrix|spectrum]]. Every '''spin network''' is an [[eigenstate]] of each such operator, and the area eigenvalue equals

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\Sigma} = 8\pi \ell_\text{PL}^2\gamma
\sum_i  \sqrt{j_i(j_i+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum goes over all intersections ''i'' of Σ with the spin network. In this formula,
*{{ell}}&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Planck length]],
*&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Immirzi parameter]] and
*''j&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, ... is the [[spin (physics)|spin]] associated with the link ''i'' of the spin network.  The two-dimensional area is therefore "concentrated" in the intersections with the spin network.

According to this formula, the lowest possible non-zero eigenvalue of the area operator corresponds to a link that carries spin 1/2 representation. Assuming an [[Immirzi parameter]] on the order of 1, this gives the smallest possible measurable area of ~10&lt;sup&gt;−66&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The formula for area eigenvalues becomes somewhat more complicated if the surface is allowed to pass through the vertices, as with anomalous diffusion models.  Also, the eigenvalues of the area operator ''A'' are constrained by [[ladder symmetry]].

Similar quantization applies to the volume operator. The volume of 3D submanifold that contains part of spin network is given by a sum of contributions from each node inside it. One can think that every node in a spin network is an elementary "quantum of volume" and every link is a "quantum of area" surrounding this volume.

=== More general gauge theories ===
Similar constructions can be made for general gauge theories with a compact Lie group G and a [[connection form]]. This is actually an exact [[duality (mathematics)|duality]] over a lattice. Over a [[manifold]] however, assumptions like [[diffeomorphism invariance]] are needed to make the duality exact (smearing [[Wilson loop]]s is tricky). Later, it was generalized by [[Robert Oeckl]] to representations of [[quantum group]]s in 2 and 3 dimensions using the [[Tannaka–Krein duality]].

[[Michael A. Levin]] and [[Xiao-Gang Wen]] have also defined [[string-net]]s using [[tensor category|tensor categories]] that are objects very similar to spin networks. However the exact connection with spin networks is not clear yet. [[String-net condensation]] produces [[topological order|topologically ordered]] states in condensed matter.

== Usage in mathematics ==
In mathematics, spin networks have been used to study [[skein module]]s and [[character variety|character varieties]], which correspond to spaces of [[Connection (mathematics)|connections]].

'''Sustainability standards and certifications''' are voluntary, usually third party-assessed, norms and standards relating to environmental, social, ethical and food safety issues, adopted by companies to demonstrate the performance of their organizations or products in specific areas.  There are perhaps up to 500 such standards{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} and the pace of introduction has increased in the last decade{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.  The trend started in the late 1980s and 90s with the introduction of [[Ecolabel]]s and standards for [[Organic food]] and other products. In recent years, numerous standards have been established and adopted in the food industry in particular{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Most of them refer to the triple bottom line of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678472 Overview article on sustainability standards in the food industry]&lt;/ref&gt; A standard is normally developed by a broad range of stakeholders and experts in a particular sector and includes a set of practices or criteria for how a crop should be sustainable grown or a resource should be ethically harvested. This might cover, for instance, responsible fishing practices that don't endanger marine biodiversity, or respect for human rights and the payment of fair wages on a coffee or tea plantation. Normally sustainability standards are accompanied by a verification process - often referred to as "certification" - to evaluate that an enterprise complies with a standard, as well as a traceability process for certified products to be sold along the supply chain, often resulting in a consumer-facing label. Certification programmes also focus on capacity building and working with partners and other organisations to support smallholders or disadvantaged producers to make the social and environmental improvements needed to meet the standard.

The basic premise of sustainability standards is twofold.  Firstly, they emerged in areas where national and global legislation was weak but where the consumer and [[NGO]] movements around the globe demanded action.  For example, campaigns by Global Exchange&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030618203029/http://www.globalexchange.org/campaigns/sweatshops/nike/ |Global Exchange Campaign - Nike]&lt;/ref&gt; and other NGOs against the purchase of goods from “[[sweatshop]]” factories by the likes of [[Nike, Inc.]], [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]] and other leading brands led to the emergence of social welfare standards like the [[SA8000]] and others.  Secondly, leading brands selling to both consumers and to the [[Business-to-business|B2B]] supply chain may wish to demonstrate the environmental or organic merits of their products, which has led to the emergence of hundreds of ecolabels{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, organic and other standards.  A leading example of a consumer standard is the [[Fairtrade]] movement, administered by [[FLO International]] and exhibiting huge sales growth around the world for ethically sourced produce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/press_office/press_releases_and_statements/jun_2009/global_fairtrade_sales_increase_by_22.aspx Fairtrade Growth] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225094221/http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/press_office/press_releases_and_statements/jun_2009/global_fairtrade_sales_increase_by_22.aspx |date=2010-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a [[Business-to-business|B2B]] standard which has grown tremendously in the last few years is the [[Forest Stewardship Council]]’s standard (FSC) for forest products made from sustainable harvested trees.

However, the line between consumer and B2B sustainability standards is becoming blurred, with leading trade buyers increasingly demanding Fairtrade certification, for example, and consumers increasingly recognizing the FSC mark. In recent years, the business-to-business focus of sustainability standards has risen as it has become clear that consumer demand alone cannot drive the transformation of major sectors and industries{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. In commodities such as palm oil, soy, farmed seafood, and sugar, certification initiatives are targeting the mainstream adoption of better practices and [[precompetitive]] industry collaboration. Major brands and retailers are also starting to make commitments to certification in their whole supply chain or product offering, rather than a single product line or ingredient{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} .

With the growth of standards and certification as the major tool for global production and trade to become more sustainable and for the private sector to demonstrate sustainability leadership, it is essential that there are ways to assess the legitimacy and performance of different initiatives. Company and government buyers, as well as NGOs and civil society groups committed to sustainable production, need clarity on which standards and ecolabels are delivering ''real'' social, environmental and economic results. The [[ISEAL Alliance]] has emerged as the authority on good practice for sustainability standards and its Codes of Good Practice represent the most widely recognised guidance on how standards should be set up and implemented in order to be effective{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. By complying with these Codes and working with other certification initiatives, ISEAL members demonstrate their credibility and work towards improving their positive impacts.

Attempts to address the problems caused by a multiplicity of certification initiatives led to the launch of [[State of Sustainability Initiatives|The State of Sustainability Initiatives (SSI)]] project, facilitated by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) and the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] (IISD) under the auspices of the Sustainable Commodity Initiative (SCI){{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

== Origin of global standards ==

''Most'' sustainability standards that are being adopted today were initiated by [[social movements]] in particular countries, such as Rainforest Alliance in the United States and Fairtrade in the Netherlands{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Other standards were initiated by individual companies, such as [[UTZ Certified|Utz Certified]] (Ahold), Starbucks C.A.F.E. (Starbucks), and Nespresso AAA (Nespresso). Some standards were launched by coalitions of private firms, development agencies, NGOs, and other stakeholders. For example, the Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C) was initiated by an alliance of large American coffee roasters, including [[Kraft Foods]], [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]] and [[Nestle]], assisted by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development ([[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GIZ]]). One important facilitator for the development of most global standards were series of local development projects involving NGOs, coffee roasters and producers in different developing countries. For example, the Fairtrade standard was developed based on pilot projects with Mexican farmers. 4C builds on development projects in Peru, Colombia and Vietnam, involving GIZ, major coffee roasters, and local producers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1668888 Article on the Development of the Common Code for the Coffee Community]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely established and adopted standards are in agriculture, with 40% of global coffee production certified to one of the main schemes, and approximately 15-20% of cocoa and tea production being compliant with major international standards. Forestry and wild seafood are also sectors in which standards have been influential, with certified production pushing past 10% of the global share. Cotton, palm oil, soy, biofuels and farmed seafood are some of the commodities in which certification is growing the fastest, due in part to major roundtables that have been set up to bring the whole industry together. More recently, standards have started to emerge for mining and the extraction of metals - including gold, silver, aluminium, and oil and gas - as well as for cattle, electronics, plastics and tourism.

Evidence suggests that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) adopted willingly by firms will be much more effective than government regulated CSR so global standards by private companies show promise for effective social impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=J. Scott|last2=Green|first2=Kesten C.|title=Effects of corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility policies|journal=Journal of Business Research|date=2013|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/43007/1/MPRA_paper_43007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the [[ISEAL Alliance]] in 2002 was the first collaborative effort amongst a group of sustainability standards organisations to agree to follow common good practices in how their standards are implemented and also to work together to drive up the use of standards and certification globally.

== Different sustainability standards ==
{{Tone|date=May 2017}}

Numerous sustainability standards have been developed in recent years to address issues of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity of global production and trade practices. Despite similarities in major goals and certification procedures, there are some significant differences in terms of their historical development, target groups of adopters, geographical diffusion, and emphasis on environmental, social or economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678472 Introduction to different standards]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major differences to be aware of is based on the level of strictness of the standard. Some standards set the bar high for a sector, promoting the strongest social and environmental practices and working with the top performers to constantly push up sustainability expectations{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Other standards are more focused on the elimination of the worst practices and operate at more of an entry-level to get a large proportion of an industry working incrementally towards better practices. Often times there are strategies between standards to move producers along this performance ladder of sustainability{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Another important distinction is that some standards can be applied internationally (usually with mechanisms to ensure local relevance and appropriateness) whereas other standards are developed entirely with a regional or national focus{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

Additional differences between standards might relate to the certification process and whether it is conducted by a first, second or third party; the traceability system in place and whether it allows for the segregation or mixing of certified and non-certified materials; and the types of sustainability claims that are made on products.

=== Fairtrade ===

The [[Fairtrade]] label was developed in the late 1980s by a Dutch development agency in collaboration with Mexican farmers{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. The initiative performs [[development work]] and promotes its political vision of an [[alternative economy]], seeing its main objective in empowering small producers and providing these with access to and improving their position on global markets{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. The ''most distinguishing'' feature of the Fairtrade label is the guarantee of a minimum price and a [[social premium]] that goes to the cooperative and not to the producers directly. Recently{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, Fairtrade also adopted environmental objectives as part of their certification system.

=== Rainforest Alliance ===
{{Tone|date=May 2017}}
The [[Rainforest Alliance]] was created in the late 1980s from a social movement and is committed to conserving rainforests and their biodiversity. One key element of the standard is the compulsory elaboration and implementation of a detailed plan for the development of a sustainable farm management system to assist wildlife conservation. Another objective is to improve workers’ welfare by establishing and securing ''sustainable'' livelihoods. Producer prices may carry a premium. Yet instead of guaranteeing a fixed [[floor price]], the standard seeks to improve the economic situation of producers through higher yields and enhanced cost efficiency{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

=== Utz Certified ===

[[UTZ Certified]] (formerly Utz Kapeh) was co-founded by the Dutch coffee roaster [[Ahold Coffee Company]] in 1997. It aims to create an open and transparent marketplace for socially and environmentally responsible agricultural products. ''Instruments'' include the UTZ Traceability System and the UTZ Code of Conduct. The traceability system makes certified products traceable from producer to final buyer and has ''stringent'' chains of custody requirements. The UTZ Code of Conduct emphasizes both environmental practices (e.g. biodiversity conservation, waste handling and water use) and social benefits (e.g. access to medical care, access to sanitary facilities at work).

=== Organic ===
The [[Organic farming|Organic]] standard was developed in the 1970s and is based on [[IFOAM]] Basic Standards{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. IFOAM stands for International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements and is the leading global umbrella organization for the organic farming movement. The IFOAM Basic Standards provide a framework of minimum requirements, including the omission of agrochemicals such as pesticides and chemical-synthetic fertilizers. The use of animal feeds is also strictly regulated. Genetic engineering and the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are forbidden{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

=== trustea ===

The [http://www.trustea.org trustea code] is designed to evaluate the social, economic, [[agronomic]] and environmental performance of Indian tea estates, smallholders and Bought Leaf Factories (BLFs).

It is expected that the compliance with the code not only improves competitiveness of the tea farms but also facilitates the tea farms in achieving compliance with national regulations and international sustainability standards in a step-wise approach. The applicable control points under eleven chapters are required to be adhered to within a four-year period. The India tea code allows producers to show that they operate responsibly– producing quality tea according to strict social and environmental standards. The verification under the code provides manufacturers with the assurance of responsible production and provides opportunities to credibly demonstrate this to their customers.

=== SuRe® – The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure ===

SuRe® is a global voluntary standard which integrates key criteria of resilience and sustainability into infrastructure development, through various criteria across governance, social and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gib-foundation.org/sure-standard/&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently developed under ISEAL guidelines by the Swiss [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] (GIB) and the French bank [[Natixis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges-africa/news/sustainable-trade-infrastructure-in-africa-a-key-element-for-growth&lt;/ref&gt; GIB and Natixis launched the SuRe® standard at a [[COP21]] event on 9 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greeneconomycoalition.org/updates/gib-launches-sure%C2%AE-standard-cop21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other examples===
Other types of standards include sector-specific schemes such as the [[Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil]] (RSPO); standards for climate and development interventions like the Gold Standard, retailer-led sustainability certification initiatives such as [[GlobalGAP]];
Corporate own-brand sustainability initiatives such as [[Starbucks#Coffee and Farmer Equity .28C.A.F.E..29 practices|Starbucks' CAFE Practices]]; and national programmes such as the [[Bord Bia|Irish Food Board]]'s 'Origin Green' scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Topics/Product-differentiation/Special-report-Implications-of-sustainability-certification-schemes-for-the-ACP ''Agritrade'': Implications of sustainability certification schemes for the ACP] 16 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards]] (UNFSS) is a joint initiative of FAO, UNEP, ITC, UNCTAD, and UNIDO on Sustainability Standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards|url=https://unfss.org|website=UNFSS|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Symmetry breaking of escaping ants''' is a phenomenon that happens when [[ant]]s are constrained into a cell with two equivalent exits, and perturbed with an [[insect repellent]]. Contrary to intuition, ants tend to use one door more than the other on average (i.e., there is a  [[symmetry breaking]] in the escape behavior), so they crowd on one of the doors, which decreases the evacuation efficiency.

==Description==

The [[symmetry breaking]] phenomenon arises in experiments described as follows. Worker ants freshly collected from the field are enclosed into a circular cell with a glass cover in such a way that they can only move in two dimensions (i.e., ants cannot pass over each other). The cell has two exits located symmetrically relative to its center. We will describe first a "reference" experiment, and then the one where the "escape [[symmetry]]" is broken.

In the reference experiment, both doors are opened at the same time and let the ants escape. If the experiment is realized many times, in average we see that approximately the same number of ants use the left and the right doors. In this experiment the escape symmetry is not broken.

The second experiment involves a further step before opening the doors: an [[insect repellent]] fluid is poured into the cell at its center through a small hole in the glass cover. As a result, ants get very excited. If the experiment is realized many times, we see that the number of ants escaping by one of the doors (which can be randomly either the left one or the right ones) is significantly higher than the number of ants escaping by the other one, i.e., the escape symmetry is broken. The crowding of ants at one of the doors while the other one may be eventually free results in an inefficient evacuation in terms of time.

Geng Li and coworkers from Beijing Normal University tested whether and how the density of a group influenced symmetry breaking in escaping ants. They used the [[red imported fire ant]] (''Solenopsis invicta'') to repeat the experiment mentioned above with different total number of ants. The result shows that the symmetry breaking increases at low density but decreases after a peak. That is to say, when density is low, the ant group produces a collective escaping behavior; while at high density, the ant group behaves more like random particles.&lt;ref name="Li et al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = G. | last2 = Huan | first2 = D. | last3 = Roehner | first3 = B. | last4 = Xu | first4 = Y.

== History==

Inspired by earlier computer simulations that predicted a symmetry breaking phenomenon when panicked humans escape from a room with two equivalent exits, E. Altshuler and coworkers from the [[University of Havana]] designed the experiment described in the section above, which revealed the symmetry breaking effect in the leaf-cutting ant ''[[Atta insularis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=E. Altshuler|title=Symmetry breaking in escaping ants|journal=American Naturalist|year=2005 |jstor=498139|doi=10.1086/498139|pmid=16475081|volume=166|issue=6|pages=643–649|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ant ''Atta insularis'' (commonly called ''bibijagua'' in Cuba) displays a high degree of [[swarm intelligence]], like most social insects, which has made them great survivors through millions of years of [[evolution]]. In Cuba, a person may be described as "smarter than ''bibijaguas''" (''"sabe mas que las bibijaguas"''). The poor evacuation efficiency illustrated by the phenomenon of symmetry breaking in escaping ants is one of the few examples where bibijaguas do not seem to behave collectively in a smart way.

==Explanations==

The basic idea is that the action of the repellent induces [[herd behavior]] in the ants. When ants are in "panic", they experience a strong tendency to follow each other. As a result, if a random fluctuation in the system produces a locally large amount of ants trying to reach one of the two doors, the fluctuation can be amplified because ants tend to follow the direction of the majority of individuals. Then, that specific door becomes crowded.

E. Altshuler and coworkers were able to reproduce their symmetry breaking experiments in ants using a simplified version of the theoretical model proposed earlier by Helbing et al. for humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. Helbing.|title= Simulating dynamical features of escape panic|journal=Nature|year=2000 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v407/n6803/full/407487a0.html|volume=407|issue=6803|pages=487–90|doi=10.1038/35035023|pmid=11028994|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the fact that walkers tend to follow the general direction of motion of their neighbors ("[[Vicsek's rule]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=T. Vicsek|title= A new type of phase transition in a system of self-driven particles|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |year=1995 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1226|bibcode=1995PhRvL..75.1226V|volume=75|issue=6|pages=1226–1229|pmid=10060237|display-authors=etal|arxiv=cond-mat/0611743}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and such herd behavior increases as the so-called "panic parameter" increases. In the case of ants, the panic parameter is supposed to be low when no repellent is used, and high when the repellent is used.

A more "biologically-sensible" model based on the deposition of an alarm [[pheromone]] by ants under stress also reproduces the symmetry breaking phenomenon, with the advantage that it also predicts the experimental output for different concentrations of ants in the cell.&lt;ref name="Li et al" /&gt;

The pheromone mechanism shares the key element of the previous models: stressed ants tend to "follow the crowd".

==Ants vs. humans escaping in panic==
From the statistical point of view, human beings and ants seem to behave in a similar way in certain scenarios, such as evacuation from a room or cell under stress, resulting in symmetry breaking phenomena: while ants increase their tendency to follow each other under stress, human beings seem to forget about [[Emergency evacuation]] strategies, and  just run towards the door where most people run to. However, the enormous physical and behavioural differences between humans and ants imply also big differences in their [[collective behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. Detrain and J.-L. Deneubourg|title=Self-organized structures in a super-organism: do ants "behave" like molecules?|journal=Physics of Life Reviews |year=2006 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571064506000200|doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2006.07.001|volume=3|issue=3|pages=162–187|bibcode=2006PhLRv...3..162D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=S. Boari|title=Efficient egress of escaping ants stressed with temperature|journal=PLOS ONE |volume=8|issue=11|pages=e81082|year=2014 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0081082&amp;representation=PDF|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0081082|pmid=24312264|pmc=3843683|bibcode=2013PLoSO...881082B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the symmetry breaking experiment on ants, for example, the individuals are relatively "polite": rarely ants are crushed by other ants in the process or evacuation. When humans are in panic, however, deaths by overpressure or suffocation are common, like in the case of the [[Love Parade disaster]] occurred in [[Germany]] in 2010.

Videos on symmetry breaking in escaping ants are available on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PANICAntsEng| author=Complexperiments |year=2012 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rz8LNesxGs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the modern [[component-free]] approach to the theory of  a '''tensor''' views a tensor as an [[abstract object]], expressing some definite type of multi-linear concept. Their well-known properties can be derived from their definitions, as linear maps or more generally; and the rules for manipulations of tensors arise as an extension of [[linear algebra]] to [[multilinear algebra]].

In [[differential geometry]] an intrinsic geometric statement may be described by a [[tensor field]] on a [[manifold]], and then doesn't need to make reference to coordinates at all. The same is true in [[general relativity]], of tensor fields describing a [[physical property]]. The component-free approach is also used extensively in [[abstract algebra]] and [[homological algebra]], where tensors arise naturally.

:'''''Note:''' This article assumes an understanding of the [[tensor product]] of [[vector space]]s without chosen [[Basis (linear algebra)|bases]]. An overview of the subject can be found in the main [[tensor]] article.''

==Definition via tensor products of vector spaces==

Given a finite set {{nowrap|{ ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; }{{null}}}} of [[vector space]]s over a common  [[Field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'', one may form their [[Tensor product#Tensor product of vector spaces|tensor product]] {{nowrap|''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ ... ⊗ ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, an element of which is termed a '''tensor'''.

A '''tensor on the vector space''' ''V'' is then defined to be an element of (i.e., a vector in) a vector space of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;V \otimes \cdots \otimes V \otimes V^* \otimes \cdots \otimes V^*&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[dual space]] of ''V''.

If there are ''m'' copies of ''V'' and ''n'' copies of ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; in our product, the tensor is said to be of '''{{nowrap|type (''m'', ''n'')}}''' and contravariant of order ''m'' and covariant order ''n'' and total [[tensor order|order]] {{nowrap|''m'' + ''n''}}. The tensors of order zero are just the scalars (elements of the field ''F''), those of contravariant order 1 are the vectors in ''V'', and those of covariant order 1 are the [[linear functional|one-forms]] in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; (for this reason the last two spaces are often called the contravariant and covariant vectors).  The space of all tensors of type {{nowrap|(''m'', ''n'')}} is denoted

:&lt;math&gt; T^m_n(V) = \underbrace{ V\otimes \dots \otimes V}_{m} \otimes \underbrace{ V^*\otimes \dots \otimes V^*}_{n} .&lt;/math&gt;

The type {{nowrap|(1, 1)}} tensors

:&lt;math&gt;V \otimes V^*&lt;/math&gt;

are isomorphic in a natural way to the space of [[linear transformations]] from ''V'' to ''V''.  A [[bilinear form]] on a real vector space ''V'', {{nowrap|''V'' × ''V'' → '''R'''}}, corresponds in a natural way to a type {{nowrap|(0, 2)}} tensor in

:&lt;math&gt;V^* \otimes V^* .&lt;/math&gt;

An example of such a bilinear form may be defined, termed the associated ''[[metric tensor]]'' (or sometimes misleadingly the ''[[metric (mathematics)|metric]]'' or ''[[inner product]]''), and is usually denoted ''g''.

==Tensor rank==
{{Main|Tensor rank decomposition}}

A '''simple tensor''' (also called a tensor of rank one, elementary tensor or decomposable tensor {{harv|Hackbusch|2012|pp=4}}) is a tensor that can be written as a product of tensors of the form
:&lt;math&gt;T=a\otimes b\otimes\cdots\otimes d&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'', ''b'', ..., ''d'' are nonzero and in ''V'' or ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; – that is, if the tensor is nonzero and completely [[factorization|factorizable]].  Every tensor can be expressed as a sum of simple tensors.  The '''rank of a tensor''' ''T'' is the minimum number of simple tensors that sum to ''T'' {{harv|Bourbaki|1989|loc=II, §7, no. 8}}.

The [[zero tensor]] has rank zero.  A nonzero order 0 or 1 tensor always has rank 1.  The rank of a non-zero order 2 or higher tensor is less than or equal to the product of the dimensions of all but the highest-dimensioned vectors in (a sum of products of) which the tensor can be expressed, which is ''d''{{i sup|''n''−1}} when each product is of ''n'' vectors from a vector space of finite-dimensional vector space of dimension ''d''.

The term ''rank of a tensor'' extends the notion of the [[rank of a matrix]] in linear algebra, although the term is also often used to mean the order (or degree) of a tensor.  The rank of a matrix is the minimum number of column vectors needed to span the [[Row and column spaces|range of the matrix]].  A matrix thus has rank one if it can be written as an [[outer product]] of two nonzero vectors:
:&lt;math&gt; A = v w^{\mathrm{T}}.&lt;/math&gt;
The rank of a matrix ''A'' is the smallest number of such outer products that can be summed to produce it:
:&lt;math&gt;A = v_1w_1^\mathrm{T} + \cdots + v_k w_k^\mathrm{T}.&lt;/math&gt;
In indices, a tensor of rank 1 is a tensor of the form
:&lt;math&gt;T_{ij\dots}^{k\ell\dots}=a_i b_j \cdots c^k d^\ell\cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

The rank of a tensor of order 2 agrees with the rank when the tensor is regarded as a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] {{harv|Halmos|1974|loc=§51}}, and can be determined from [[Gaussian elimination]] for instance.  The rank of an order 3 or higher tensor is however often ''very hard'' to determine, and low rank decompositions of tensors are sometimes of great practical interest {{harv|de Groote|1987}}.  Computational tasks such as the efficient multiplication of matrices and the efficient evaluation of polynomials can be recast as the problem of simultaneously evaluating a set of [[bilinear form]]s
:&lt;math&gt;z_k = \sum_{ij} T_{ijk}x_iy_j\,&lt;/math&gt;
for given inputs ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.  If a low-rank decomposition of the tensor ''T'' is known, then an efficient [[evaluation strategy]] is known {{harv|Knuth|1998|pp=506–508}}.

==Universal property==
The space &lt;math&gt;T^m_n(V)&lt;/math&gt; can be characterized by a [[universal property]] in terms of [[multilinear map]]pings. Amongst the advantages of this approach are that it gives a way to show that many linear mappings are "natural" or "geometric" (in other words are independent of any choice of basis). Explicit computational information can then be written down using bases, and this order of priorities can be more convenient than proving a formula gives rise to a natural mapping. Another aspect is that tensor products are not used only for [[free module]]s, and the "universal" approach carries over more easily to more general situations.

A scalar-valued function on a [[Cartesian product]] (or [[Direct sum of modules|direct sum]]) of vector spaces
:&lt;math&gt;f : V_1\times V_2\times\cdots\times V_N \to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;
is multilinear if it is linear in each argument. The space of all multlinear mappings from the product {{nowrap|''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × ... × ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}} into ''W'' is denoted
''L''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''V''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;;&amp;nbsp;''W'').  When ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, a multilinear mapping is just an ordinary linear mapping, and the space of all linear mappings from ''V'' to ''W'' is denoted {{nowrap|''L''(''V''; ''W'')}}.

The [[tensor product#Universal property|universal characterization of the tensor product]] implies that, for each multilinear function
:&lt;math&gt;f\in L^{m+n}(\underbrace{V,V,\dots,V}_m,\underbrace{V^*,V^*,\dots,V^*}_n;W)&lt;/math&gt;
there exists a unique linear function
:&lt;math&gt;T_f \in L(V\otimes\cdots\otimes V\otimes V^*\otimes\cdots\otimes V^*; W)&lt;/math&gt;
such that
:&lt;math&gt;f(v_1,\dots,v_m,\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n) = T_f(v_1\otimes\cdots\otimes v_m\otimes\alpha_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\alpha_n)&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''V'' and ''α''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.

Using the universal property, it follows that the space of (''m'',''n'')-tensors admits a [[natural isomorphism]]
:&lt;math&gt;T^m_n(V) \cong
L(V^* \otimes \dots \otimes V^* \otimes V \otimes \dots \otimes V ; \mathbb{R})
\cong L^{m+n}(V^*,\dots,V^*,V,\dots,V;\mathbb{R}).&lt;/math&gt;

In the formula above, the roles of ''V'' and ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; are reversed. In particular, one has

:&lt;math&gt;T^1_0(V) \cong L(V^*;\mathbb{R}) \cong V&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;T^0_1(V) \cong L(V;\mathbb{R}) = V^*&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;T^1_1(V) \cong L(V;V).&lt;/math&gt;

==Tensor fields==
{{Main|tensor field}}

[[Differential geometry]], [[physics]] and [[engineering]] must often deal with [[tensor field]]s on [[smooth manifold]]s. The term ''tensor'' is sometimes used as a shorthand for ''tensor field''. A tensor field expresses the concept of a tensor that varies from point to point on the manifold.

'''Terrorism insurance''' is [[insurance]] purchased by property owners to cover their potential losses and liabilities that might occur due to [[terrorism|terrorist]] activities.

It is considered to be a difficult product for insurance companies, as the odds of terrorist attacks are very difficult to predict and the potential liability enormous. For example, the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] resulted in an estimated $31.7 billion loss.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This combination of uncertainty and potentially huge losses makes the setting of [[insurance premium|premiums]] a difficult matter. Most insurance companies therefore exclude terrorism from coverage in [[Casualty insurance|casualty]] and [[property insurance]], or else require endorsements to provide coverage.

==Industry needs==
Concentration of risk is another factor in determining availability for terrorism insurance. Due to the concentrated losses of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], carriers were hit with large losses in one centralized location. Insurers seek to spread the coverage over a wider geographic area than as with other aggregate perils, such as flood.

==Modelling the risks==

Insurance companies are using an approach that is similar to that used with natural catastrophe risks. A Swiss report{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} suggested that in this case where demand is greater than the supply for terrorism coverage that a short-term solution is possible: a mix of government and private resource to make easy the transition. In this situation, the government would serve two functions: to establish rules to overcome the capacity shortage and to be the insurer of last resort.

==By country==

===Netherlands===
[[Insurance]] payments related to [[terrorism]] are restricted to a billion euro per year for all insurance companies together{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}. This regards property insurance, but also life insurance, medical insurance, etc.

===United States===

In 2002, the [[US Congress]] enacted the [[Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]], in which the government shared the cost of large insurance losses.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Expiring terrorism insurance program alarms Md. industries|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-terrorism-insurance-20141227-story.html#page=1|publisher=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 26, 2007, the President of the United States signed into law the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 which extends the [[Terrorism Risk Insurance Act|Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA)]] through December 31, 2014. The law extends the temporary federal Program that provides for a transparent system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/financial-institution/terrorism-insurance/ U.S. Treasury - Office of Domestic Finance - Terrorism Risk Insurance Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114045440/http://www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/financial-institution/terrorism-insurance/ |date=2007-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists have supported U.S. government subsidies of terrorism insurance.  Soon after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, economist [[Edwin Mills (economist)|Edwin Mills]] expressed concern over whether private developers could build real estate without subsidies for insurance.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Mills, Terrorism and US real estate, Journal of Urban Economics 51 (2002) 198–204.&lt;/ref&gt;  Economist [[David R. Barker]] argued that properly structured subsidies could increase overall economic efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;David Barker, Terrorism insurance subsidies and social welfare, Journal of Urban Economics 54 (2003) 328–338&lt;/ref&gt;  Other economists have argued against these subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act: Time to End the Corporate Welfare|url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa736_web_1.pdf|publisher=Cato Institute|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dwight Jaffee and Thomas Russell, Public Insurance and Private Markets, 2010, pp. 86-114, Washington, D.C.: AEI Press; distributed by Rowman and Littlefield, Lanham, Md.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States insurance market offers coverage to the majority of large companies which ask for it in their policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pciaa.net/sitehome.nsf/lcpublic/|title=Property Casualty Insurers Association of America|publisher=|accessdate=12 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909014736/http://www.pciaa.net/sitehome.nsf/lcpublic/|archivedate=9 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price of the policy depends on where the clients are residing and how much limit they buy.

[[Image:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11.jpeg|thumb|right|[[9/11|Attack]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]]]
According to ''The Economist''{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, one of the best studies to understand TRIA has been the one undertaken in 2005 by the Center for Risk Management at the Wharton Business School ("TRIA and Beyond"; available on their website below).

In mid-2007 the idea of another extension to TRIA was tabled and is officially known as TRIREA{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, (Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act). Initially TRIREA contained several new provisions including a mandatory 'make available' clause for NCBR coverage (Nuclear, Chemical, Biological and Radiological) and the ending of the distinction between domestic and foreign events.

The act expired on December 31, 2014, but was renewed at the start of the next congress, with Obama signing the extension of the TIRA through 2020 on January 12, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sddt.com/Construction/article.cfm?SourceCode=20150116czm&amp;_t=TRIA+reauthorized+with+several+tweaks#.V4fRhPkrLDc|title=TRIA reauthorized with several tweaks|date=2015-01-19|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the 2014 expiration, many experts warned that "construction projects could be stalled and commercial loans on shopping malls, utilities and skyscrapers could be in jeopardy." In addition, according to the [[Baltimore Sun]], the [[National Football League]] denied rumors that it would cancel the [[Super Bowl]] over the issue.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Iraq===
The [[New York Times]] reports that in Baghdad personal terrorism insurance is available. One company offers such insurance for $90, and if the customer is a victim of terrorism in the next year, it pays the heirs $3,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/21/international/middleeast/21insurance.html?_r=1|title=New Business Blooms in Iraq: Terror Insurance|publisher=|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], following the [[Baltic Exchange bomb|Baltic Exchange bomb in 1992]], all UK insurers stopped including terrorism coverage on their commercial insurance policies with effect from 1 January 1993 (home insurance policies were unaffected).  As a consequence, the government and insurance industry established the [[Pool Re|Pool Reinsurance Company Ltd (Pool Re)]]. Primarily funded by premiums paid by policyholders, the government guarantees the fund although any such support must be repaid from future premiums. To date, despite paying over £600 million in relation to thirteen separate claims, no government support has been necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Company|url=https://www.poolre.co.uk/|website=Pool Reinsurance|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In [[France]], a pool of insurers and reinsurers was set up on 1 January 2002 under the name Gestion de l'Assurance et de la RÉassurance des risques attentats et Actes de Terrorisme (GAREAT). GAREAT is constituted upon the principle of mutuality between its Members, all of whom are jointly liable, and relies on the support given to GAREAT by international reinsurers as well as by the French State which provides unlimited coverage to the GAREAT programme via unlimited treaties reinsured 100% by [[:fr:Caisse centrale de réassurance|Caisse Centrale de Réassurance (CCR)]]. As a non-profit-making Economic Interest Grouping mandated by its Members, GAREAT returns to the latter that part of the premiums which are not used to finance the reinsurance coverage at the close of each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who are we?|url=http://www.gareat.com/en|website=GAREAT|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gestion de l'assurance et de la réassurance des risques attentats et actes de terrorisme|url=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestion_de_l%27assurance_et_de_la_r%C3%A9assurance_des_risques_attentats_et_actes_de_terrorisme|website=Wikipédia (French)|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2017}}

The goals of the movement included securing [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection under the law]], ending legally established [[racial discrimination]], and gaining equal access to public facilities, [[education reform]], fair housing, and the ability to vote.

==1954–1959==
===1954===
*May 3{{spaced ndash}}In ''[[Hernandez v. Texas]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court rules that [[Mexican American]]s and all other racial groups in the United States are entitled to equal protection under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].
*May 17{{spaced ndash}} In ''[[Brown v. Board of Education|Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kans.]]'' and in ''[[Bolling v.

In [[mathematics]], '''unimodality''' means possessing a unique [[mode (statistics)|mode]]. More generally, unimodality means there is only a single highest value, somehow defined, of some mathematical object.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=Unimodal|title=Unimodal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unimodal probability distribution ==
[[File:Normal distribution pdf.svg|thumb|'''Figure 1.''' [[probability density function]] of normal distributions, an example of unimodal distribution.]]
[[File:Bimodal.png|thumb|'''Figure 2.''' a simple bimodal distribution.]]
[[File:Bimodal geological.PNG|thumb|'''Figure 3.''' A bimodal distribution. Note that only the largest peak would correspond to a mode in the strict sense of the definition of mode]]

In [[statistics]], a '''unimodal probability distribution''' or '''unimodal distribution''' is a [[probability distribution]] which has a single peak. The term "mode" in this context refers to any peak of the distribution, not just to the strict definition of [[mode (statistics)|mode]] which is usual in statistics.  

If there is a single mode, the distribution function is called "unimodal". If it has more modes it is "bimodal" (2), "trimodal" (3), etc., or in general, "multimodal".&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=Mode|title=Mode}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figure 1 illustrates [[normal distribution]]s, which are unimodal. Other examples of unimodal distributions include [[Cauchy distribution]], [[Student's t-distribution]], [[chi-squared distribution]] and [[exponential distribution]]. Among discrete distributions, the [[binomial distribution]] and [[Poisson distribution]] can be seen as unimodal, though for some parameters they can have two adjacent values with the same probability.

Figure 2 and Figure 3 illustrate bimodal distributions.

===Other definitions===
Other definitions of unimodality in distribution functions also exist.

In continuous distributions, unimodality can be defined through the behavior of the [[cumulative distribution function]] (cdf).&lt;ref name=Khinchin&gt;{{cite journal|author=A.Ya. Khinchin|title=On unimodal distributions|journal=Trams. Res. Inst. Math. Mech.|publisher=University of Tomsk|volume=2|issue=2|year=1938|pages=1–7|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the cdf is [[convex function|convex]] for ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''m'' and [[concave function|concave]] for ''x''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''m'', then the distribution is unimodal, ''m'' being the mode. Note that under this definition the [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] is unimodal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Springer|title=Unimodal distribution|id=U/u095330|first=N.G.|last=Ushakov}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as any other distribution in which the maximum distribution is achieved for a range of values, e.g. trapezoidal distribution.  Note also that usually this definition allows for a discontinuity at the mode; usually in a continuous distribution the probability of any single value is zero, while this definition allows for a non-zero probability, or an "atom of probability", at the mode.

Criteria for unimodality can also be defined through the [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of the distribution&lt;ref name=Khinchin/&gt; or through its [[Laplace–Stieltjes transform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Random summation: limit theorems and applications|author=Vladimirovich Gnedenko and Victor Yu Korolev|ISBN=0-8493-2875-6|publisher=CRC-Press|year=1996}} p.&amp;nbsp;31&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to define a unimodal discrete distribution is by the occurrence of sign changes in the sequence of differences of the probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the unimodality of discrete distributions |journal=Periodica Mathematica Hungarica|first=P. |last=Medgyessy|volume= 2| issue = 1–4 |pages=245–257|date=March 1972|url=http://www.akademiai.com/content/j5012306777g764n/ |doi=10.1007/bf02018665}}&lt;/ref&gt; A discrete distribution with a [[probability mass function]], &lt;math&gt;\{p_n ;  n = \dots, -1, 0, 1, \dots \} &lt;/math&gt;, is called unimodal if the sequence &lt;math&gt;\dots, p_{-2} - p_{-1}, p_{-1} - p_0, p_0 - p_1, p_1 - p_2, \dots&lt;/math&gt; has exactly one sign change (when zeroes don't count).

===Uses and results===
One reason for the importance of distribution unimodality is that it allows for several important results. Several inequalities are given below which are only valid for unimodal distributions. Thus, it is important to assess whether or not a given data set comes from a unimodal distribution. Several tests for unimodality are given in the article on [[multimodal distribution]].

===Inequalities===
{{See also|Chebychev's inequality#Unimodal distributions}}

====Gauss's inequality====

A first important result is [[Gauss's inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gauss|first=C. F.|authorlink=Carl Friedrich Gauss|year=1823|title=Theoria Combinationis Observationum Erroribus Minimis Obnoxiae, Pars Prior|journal=Commentationes Societatis Regiae Scientiarum Gottingensis Recentiores|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauss's inequality gives an upper bound on the probability that a value lies more than any given distance from its mode. This inequality depends on unimodality.

====Vysochanskiï–Petunin inequality====

A second is the [[Vysochanskiï–Petunin inequality]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D. F. Vysochanskij,  Y. I. Petunin |year=1980 |title=Justification of the 3&amp;sigma; rule for unimodal distributions |journal=Theory of Probability and Mathematical Statistics |volume=21 |pages=25–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; a refinement of the [[Chebyshev inequality]]. The Chebyshev inequality guarantees that in any probability distribution, "nearly all" the values are "close to" the mean value. The Vysochanskiï–Petunin inequality refines this to even nearer values, provided that the distribution function is continuous and unimodal. Further results were shown by Sellke &amp; Sellke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

where the median is ''ν'', the mean is ''μ'' and  ''ω'' is the root mean square deviation from the mode.

It can be shown for a unimodal distribution that the median ''ν'' and the  mean ''μ'' lie within (3/5)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 0.7746 standard deviations of each other.&lt;ref name="unimodal"&gt;[http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/S0040585X97975447 Basu, Sanjib, and Anirban DasGupta. "The mean, median, and mode of unimodal distributions: a characterization." Theory of Probability &amp; Its Applications 41.2 (1997): 210-223.]&lt;/ref&gt; In symbols,

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{ | \nu - \mu | }{ \sigma } \le \sqrt{ \frac{ 3 } { 5 } }&lt;/math&gt;

where |.| is the absolute value.

A similar relation holds between the median and the mode ''θ'': they lie within 3&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 1.732 standard deviations of each other:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{ | \nu - \theta |}{ \sigma } \le \sqrt{ 3 }.&lt;/math&gt;

It can also be shown that the mean and the mode lie within 3&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; of each other.

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{ | \mu - \theta |}{ \sigma } \le \sqrt{ 3 }.&lt;/math&gt;

====Skewness and kurtosis====

Rohatgi and Szekely have shown that the [[skewness]] and [[kurtosis]] of a unimodal distribution are related by the inequality:&lt;ref name=Rohatgi1989&gt;Rohatgi VK, Szekely GJ (1989) Sharp inequalities between skewness and kurtosis. Statistics &amp; Probability Letters 8:297-299&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \gamma^2 - \kappa \le \frac{ 6 }{ 5 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''κ'' is the kurtosis and ''γ'' is the skewness.

Klaassen, Mokveld, and van Es derived a slightly different inequality (shown below) from the one derived by Rohatgi and Szekely (shown above), which tends to be more inclusive (i.e., yield more positives) in tests of unimodality:&lt;ref name=Klaassen2000&gt;Klaassen CAJ, Mokveld PJ, van Es B (2000) Squared skewness minus kurtosis bounded by 186/125 for unimodal distributions. Stat &amp; Prob Lett 50 (2) 131–135&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \gamma^2 - \kappa \le \frac{ 186 }{ 125 } &lt;/math&gt;

==Unimodal function==
As the term "modal" applies to data sets and probability distribution, and not in general to functions, the definitions above do not apply. The definition of "unimodal" was extended to functions of [[real number]]s as well.

A common definition is as follows: a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''(''x'') is a '''unimodal function''' if for some value ''m'', it is [[monotonic]]ally increasing for ''x'' ≤ ''m'' and monotonically decreasing for ''x'' ≥ ''m''. In that case, the [[maximum]] value of ''f''(''x'') is ''f''(''m'') and there are no other local maxima.

Proving unimodality is often hard. One way consists in using the definition of that property, but it turns out to be suitable for simple functions only. A general method based on derivatives exists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://homepage.univie.ac.at/thibaut.barthelemy/METRIC.pdf|title=On the unimodality of METRIC Approximation subject to normally distributed demands.|work=Method in appendix D, Example in theorem 2 page 5|accessdate=2013-08-28|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it does not succeed for every function despite its simplicity.

Examples of unimodal functions include [[quadratic polynomial]] functions with a negative quadratic coefficient, [[tent map]] functions, and more.

The above is sometimes related to as "strong unimodality", from the fact that the monotonicity implied is ''strong monotonicity''. A function ''f''(''x'') is a '''weakly unimodal function''' if there exists a value ''m'' for which it is weakly monotonically increasing for ''x'' ≤ ''m'' and weakly monotonically decreasing for ''x'' ≥ ''m''.  In that case, the maximum value ''f''(''m'') can be reached for a continuous range of values of ''x''. An example of a weakly unimodal function which is not strongly unimodal is every other row in a [[Pascal triangle]].

Depending on context, unimodal function may also refer to a function that has only one local minimum, rather than maximum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://glossary.computing.society.informs.org/second.php?page=U.html|title=Mathematical Programming Glossary.|work=|accessdate=2010-07-07|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[local unimodal sampling]], a method for doing numerical optimization, is often demonstrated with such a function. It can be said that a unimodal function under this extension is a function with a single local [[extremum]].

One important property of unimodal functions is that the extremum can be found using [[search algorithm]]s such as [[golden section search]], [[ternary search]] or [[successive parabolic interpolation]].

==Other extensions==

A function ''f''(''x'') is "S-unimodal" (often referred to as "S-unimodal map") if its [[Schwarzian derivative]] is negative for all &lt;math&gt;\ x \ne  c&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the critical point.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{cite news|title=Distortion of S-Unimodal Maps|authors=John Guckenheimer and Stewart Johnson|journal=Annals of Mathematics |series=Second Series|volume=132|number=1|date=July 1990|pages=71–130|doi=10.2307/1971501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computational geometry]] if a function is unimodal it permits the design of efficient algorithms for finding the extrema of the function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Godfried T. Toussaint|title=Complexity, convexity, and unimodality|journal=International Journal of Computer and Information Sciences|volume=13|number=3|date=June 1984|pages=197–217|doi=10.1007/bf00979872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more general definition, applicable to a function f(X) of a vector variable X is that f is unimodal if there is a one-to-one differentiable mapping
''X'' = ''G''(''Z'') such that ''f''(''G''(''Z'')) is convex.  Usually one would want ''G''(''Z'') to be continuously differentiable with nonsingular Jacobian matrix.

[[Quasiconvex function]]s and quasiconcave functions extend the concept of unimodality to functions whose arguments belong to higher-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]s.

In [[law]] and [[ethics]], '''universal law''' or '''universal principle''' refers as concepts of legal [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] actions, whereby those [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] and rules for governing human beings' conduct which are most universal in their acceptability, their applicability, translation, and [[philosophical]] basis, are therefore considered to be most legitimate.  One type of Universal Law is the Law of Logic which prohibits logical contradictions known as sophistry.  The Law of Logic is based upon the universal idea that logic is defined as that which is not illogical and that which is illogical is that which involves a logical contradiction, such as attempting to assert that an apple and no apple can exist at and in the same time and in the same place, and attempting to assert that A and not A can exist at and in the same time and in the same place. What goes around , comes around.

[[File:Original Position.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Symbolic depiction of Rawls's veil of ignorance.  The citizens making the choices about their society make them from an "original position" of equality and ignorance ''(left)'', without knowing what gender, race, abilities, tastes, wealth, or position in society they will have ''(right)''.  Rawls claims this ensures they will choose a just society. ]]

The "'''veil of ignorance'''" is a method of determining the [[morality]] of political issues proposed in 1971 by American philosopher [[John Rawls]] in his "[[original position]]" [[political philosophy]]. It is based upon the following [[thought experiment]]: people making political decisions imagine that they know nothing about the particular talents, abilities, tastes, social class, and positions they will have within a social order. When such parties are selecting the principles for distribution of rights, positions, and resources in the society in which they will live, this "veil of ignorance" prevents them from knowing who will receive a given distribution of rights, positions, and resources in that society. For example, for a proposed society in which 50% of the population is kept in [[slavery]], it follows that on entering the new society there is a 50% likelihood that the participant would be a slave. The idea is that parties subject to the veil of ignorance will make choices based upon moral considerations, since they will not be able to make choices based on their own self- or class-interest.

As Rawls put it, "no one knows his place in society, his class position or social status; nor does he know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, his intelligence and strength, and the like".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Theory of Justice|first=John|last=Rawls|authorlink=John Rawls|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1999 | page = 118 | isbn = 0-674-00078-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the thought experiment is to render obsolete those personal considerations that are morally irrelevant to the [[justice]] or injustice of principles meant to allocate the benefits of social cooperation. The veil of ignorance is part of a long tradition of thinking in terms of a [[social contract]] that includes the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]], and [[Thomas Jefferson]].

==The concept==
Spencer J. Maxcy outlines the concept as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Imagine that you have set for yourself the task of developing a totally new social contract for today's society. How could you do so fairly? Although you could never actually eliminate all of your personal biases and prejudices, you would need to take steps at least to minimize them. Rawls suggests that you imagine yourself in an original position behind a veil of ignorance. Behind this veil, you know nothing of yourself and your natural abilities, or your position in society. You know nothing of your sex, race, nationality, or individual tastes. Behind such a veil of ignorance all individuals are simply specified as rational, free, and morally equal beings. You do know that in the "real world", however, there will be a wide variety in the natural distribution of natural assets and abilities, and that there will be differences of sex, race, and culture that will distinguish groups of people from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEpQCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq|title=Ethical School Leadership|last=Maxcy|first=Spencer J.|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=|location=|page=93|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been argued that such a concept can have grand effects if it were to be practiced both in the present and in the past. Referring again to the example of slavery, if the slave-owners were forced through the veil of ignorance to imagine that they themselves may be slaves, then suddenly slavery may no longer seem justifiable. A grander example would be if each individual in society were to base their practices off the fact that they could be the least advantaged member of society. In this scenario, freedom and equality could possibly coexist in a way that has been the ideal of many philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andreaskluth.org/2009/10/28/the-veil-of-ignorance-another-great-thought-experiment|title=The veil of ignorance: great thought experiment|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the imaginary society, one might or might not be intelligent, rich, or born into a preferred class. Since one may occupy any position in the society once the veil is lifted, the device forces the parties to consider society from the perspective of all members, including the worst-off and best-off members.

==History==
The concept of the veil of ignorance has been in use by other names for centuries by philosophers such as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Immanuel Kant]] whose work discussed the concept of the [[social contract]]. [[John Harsanyi]] helped to formalize the concept in economics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. C. |last=Harsanyi |title=Cardinal Utility in Welfare Economics and in the Theory of Risk-taking |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy|J. Polit. Economy]] |volume=61 |year=1953 |issue=5 |pages=434–435 |jstor=1827289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. C. |last=Harsanyi |title=Cardinal Welfare, Individualistic Ethics, and Interpersonal Comparisons of Utility |journal=J. Polit. Economy |volume=63 |issue=4 |year=1955 |pages=309–21 |jstor=1827128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that it provides an argument in favor of [[utilitarianism]] rather than an argument for a social contract.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freeman|first1=Samuel|title=Original Position|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=13 September 2017|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern usage was developed by John Rawls in his 1971 book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Rawls |title=A Theory of Justice |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=[[Belknap Press]] |year=1971 |isbn=0-674-00078-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Rawls |title=[[Justice as Fairness: A Restatement]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Belknap Press |year=2001 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Viral dynamics''' is a field of [[applied mathematics]] concerned with describing the progression of viral infections within a host organism.&lt;ref name="VDbook" &gt;{{cite book |last1=Nowak |first1=Martin |last2=May |first2=Robert |date=2001 |title=Virus Dynamics: mathematical principles of immunology and virology | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Kixhc3IiCy4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=virus+dynamics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9yXeVIHfH4a8yQTipIGYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=virus%20dynamics&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It employs a family of [[mathematical model]]s that describe changes over time in the populations of cells targeted by the virus and the [[viral load]]. These equations may also track competition between different viral strains and the influence of immune responses. The original viral dynamics models were inspired by compartmental [[epidemic model]]s (e.g. the SI model), with which they continue to share many common mathematical features, such as the concept of the [[basic reproduction number|basic reproductive ratio]] (''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). The major distinction between these fields is in the scale at which the models operate: while epidemiological models track the spread of infection between individuals within a population (i.e. "between host"), viral dynamics models track the spread of infection between cells within an individual (i.e. "within host"). Analyses employing viral dynamic models have been used extensively to study [[HIV]],&lt;ref name="VDbook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perelson|first1=Alan S|last2=Ribeiro|first2=Ruy M|title=Modeling the within-host dynamics of HIV infection|journal=BMC Biology|date=2013|volume=11|issue=1|page=96|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-11-96|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/11/96/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hepatitis B virus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowak|first1=MA|last2=Bonhoeffer|first2=S|last3=Hill|first3=AM|last4=Boehme|first4=R|last5=Thomas|first5=HC|last6=McDade|first6=H|title=Viral dynamics in hepatitis B virus infection|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=1996|volume=93|pages=4398–4402| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/93/9/4398.short|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.9.4398|pmc=39549}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ciupe|first1=SM|last2=Ribeiro|first2=RM|last3=Nelson|first3=PW|last4=Perelson|first4=AS|title=Modeling the mechanisms of acute hepatitis B virus infection|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=2007|volume=247|issue=1|pages=23–35|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.02.017|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519307000938|pmc=1994818}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hepatitis C virus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neumann|first1=A|last2=Lam|first2=NP|last3=Dahari|first3=H|last4=Gretch|first4=DR|last5=Wiley|first5=TE|last6=Layden|first6=TJ|last7=Perelson|first7=AS|title=Hepatitis C Viral Dynamics in Vivo and the Antiviral Efficacy of Interferon-α Therapy|journal=Science|date=1998|volume=282|issue=5386|pages=103–107|doi=10.1126/science.282.5386.103|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/282/5386/103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chatterjee|first1=A|last2=Smith|first2=PF|last3=Perelson|first3=AS|title=Hepatitis C Viral Kinetics: The Past, Present, and Future|journal=Clinics in Liver Disease|date=2013|volume=17|issue=1|pages=13–26|doi=10.1016/j.cld.2012.09.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1089326112000992|pmc=3584572}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other infections

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6053">'''Völkerabfälle''' is a term used by [[Frederick Engels]] to describe small nations which he considered residual fragments of former peoples who had succumbed to more powerful neighbours in the historic process of social development and which Engels considered prone to become "fanatical standard-bearers of counter-revolution".&lt;ref name="MS"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Engels |first1=Frederick |title=Magyar Struggle |journal=Neue Rheinsiche Zeitung |date=1849 |issue=No. 194 |url=http://www.marxistsfr.org/archive/marx/works/1849/01/13.htm |accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He offers as examples:&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt;
* the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]]: "Such, in Scotland, are the [[Gaels]], the supporters of the [[Stuarts]] from 1640 to 1745."
* the [[Chouannerie]]: "Such, in France, are the [[Bretons]], the supporters of the [[Bourbons]] from 1792 to 1800."
* the [[First Carlist War]]: "Such, in Spain, are the [[Basques]], the supporters of [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Don Carlos]]."

Engels was referring also specifically to the [[Serb uprising of 1848–49]], in which Serbs from Vojvodina fought against the previously victorious [[Hungarian_Revolution_of_1848#Serbs_of_Vojvodina|Hungarian revolution]]. Engels finished the article with the folwing prediction:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But at the first victorious uprising of the French proletariat, which Louis Napoleon is striving with all his might to conjure up, the Austrian Germans and Magyars will be set free and wreak a bloody revenge on the Slav barbarians. The general war which will then break out will smash this Slav [[Sonderbund]] and wipe out all these petty hidebound nations, down to their very names.&lt;p&gt;The next world war will result in the disappearance from the face of the earth not only of reactionary classes and dynasties, but also of entire reactionary peoples. And that, too, is a step forward.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Critique==
Engels views were criticised by leading socialist [[Karl Kautsky]] who in 1915 argued that subsequent to 1848/9 the Czech and Austrian South Slavs had transformed themselves in a manner which in practice refuted the views of Marx and Engels. Referring to [[Heinrich Cunow]] he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Today when those people have achieved such great power and significance to refer to them in the old Marxian terms of 1848/9 does appear most unfortunate. Should someone today still hold onto that standpoint he has a lot to unlearn&lt;ref name="Herod"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Herod |first1=N. A. |title=The Nation in the History of Marxian Thought: The Concept of Nations with History and Nations without History |date=2013 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9789401747547 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Mb2lBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=V%C3%B6lkerabf%C3%A4lle#v=onepage&amp;q=V%C3%B6lkerabf%C3%A4lle&amp;f=false |accessdate=15 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Roman Rozdolsky]] analyses Engels' position in his book ''Engels and the 'Nonhistoric' Peoples: the National Question in the Revolution of 1848''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are two ways to look at Marx and Engels: as the creators of a brilliant, but in its deepest essence, thoroughly critical, scientific method; or as church fathers of some sort, the bronzed figures of a monument. Those who have the latter vision will not have found this study to their taste. We, however, prefer to see them as they were in reality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rosdolsky examines Engels' viewpoint at length. Both Marx and Engels had supported the [[1848 revolution]] which had spread throughout Europe. They saw this as a necessary first step towards the Socialist revolution, which was hoped to be imminent. However, the forces of reaction rallied in [[Klemens von Metternich]]'s Austria in October 1848 with the brutal suppression of the [[Vienna Uprising]]. Engels was prompted to write his article thanks to the Austrian Slavs' rejection of the opportunity to liberate themselves from the oppressive rule of the [[Habsburgs]], as well their enthusiastic embrace of Metternich’s counter-revolution.&lt;ref name="Clarkson"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clarkson |first1=Andy |title=Reviews – Engels and the 'Nonhistoric' Peoples |url=https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/revhist/backiss/vol3/no2/rosdolsk.html |website=www.marxists.org |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
This last passage, the final paragraph of Engels' article in 1849, has fuelled accusations that this constitutes a call for genocide. The British [[Liberalism|Liberal]] historian, [[George G.

'''WORM''' is a [[Rotterdam]] based [[non-profit]] [[Foundation (non-profit)|foundation]] and a multi-media alternative [[cultural centre]] focused on [[experimental]], [[new media art]], [[avant-garde]] and [[underground art]], primarily [[music]] and [[movie]]s. WORM is funded by the [[Triodos Bank]] and part of the culture nota 2009-2012 from the Dutch government. The foundation has received the Pendrecht Culture Prize and its venue is part of the Rotterdam culture plan.

WORM organises festivals and concerts, movie nights, runs an independent record label, a radio station. Part of the organisation is also a [[Computer lab#Media_lab|media lab]], a [[hackspace]], and a music studio. The media lab and music studio both run free [[artist in residence]] programmes for artists and [[experimental music]]ians. Experimental musician [[Lukas Simonis]] is the programmer of the artist in residence programme for the music studio. The studio has a collection of [[experimental musical instrument]]s built by [[Yuri landman|Yuri Landman]]. Artists that have been in residence at WORM were [[Tujiko Noriko]], [[Toktek]], [[Machinefabriek]], [[Jørgen Teller]], [[One Man Nation]], [[Blevin Blectum]], [[Kevin Blechdom]], Joe Howe, [[Eugene Chadbourne]], [[Lucas Crane]], [[Jim Xentos]], [[Knull]], [[Ben Butler (musician)|Ben Butler]] and Mousepad, [[Colin Black]], Harry Taylor ([[Action Beat]]), [[Stignoise]], [[Hovatron]], Martijn Comes, Danielle Lemaire and others.

Besides the venue and studio the foundation also has a shop with [[left field]] music, [[art house]] movies and books about subjects related to the cultural focus of the organisation.

WORM developed the [[Web 2.0 Suicide Machine]]. The organisation co-operates closely with [[International Film Festival Rotterdam]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmfestivalrotterdam.com/professionals/programme/sections_events_iffr_2009/live/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poetry International]], [[Incubate (festival)|Incubate]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100819234637/http://www.incubate.org/2010/event/23 Wocci]&lt;/ref&gt; [[State-X|State-X New Forms]], [[Museumnacht]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kultprom.org/ Kultprom]&lt;/ref&gt;

WORM was based at the [[Achterhaven]] till 2010. In 2011 it moved to the centre of Rotterdam and is currently located in the building formerly used as the [[Nederlands Fotomuseum]] (Dutch Photo Museum) at the Witte de Withstraat.

[[Image:Waterfall-chart.jpg|thumb|300px|A typical waterfall chart]]

A '''waterfall chart''' is a form of [[data visualization]] that helps in understanding the cumulative effect of sequentially introduced positive or negative values. These intermediate values can either be time based or category based. The waterfall [[chart]] is also known as a '''flying bricks chart''' or '''Mario chart''' due to the apparent suspension of columns (bricks) in mid-air. Often in [[finance]], it will be referred to as a '''bridge'''.

Waterfall charts were popularized by the strategic consulting firm [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] in its presentations to clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blog.ideatransplant.com/2008/08/how-to-create-mckinsey-waterfall-chart.html| title=How to Create a McKinsey-style waterfall chart| publisher=Idea transplant}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ethan M. Rasiel. ''The McKinsey Way.''  McGraw–Hill, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Complexity can be added to waterfall charts with multiple total columns and values that cross the axis. Increments and decrements that are sufficiently extreme can cause the cumulative total to fall above and below the axis at various points. Intermediate subtotals, depicted with whole columns, can be added to the graph between floating columns. 

==Overview==
The waterfall, also known as a bridge or cascade, chart is used to portray how an initial value is affected by a series of intermediate positive or negative values. Usually the initial and the final values (end points) are represented by whole columns, while the intermediate values are shown as floating columns that begin based on the value of the previous column. The columns can be [[color-coded]] for distinguishing between positive and negative values.

==Applications==
A waterfall chart can be used for [[analysis|analytical]] purposes, especially for understanding or explaining the gradual transition in the quantitative value of an entity which is subjected to increment or decrement. Often, a waterfall or cascade chart is used to show changes in revenue or profit between two time periods.

[[Image:waterfallchart ex2.jpg|frame|center|alt=A waterfall chart showing profitability analysis.|Waterfall chart showing profitability analysis]]

Waterfall charts can be used for various types of [[statistics|quantitative analysis]], ranging from [[inventory analysis]] to [[Performance attribution|performance analysis]].

Waterfall charts are also commonly used in [[financial analysis]] to display how a net value is arrived at through gains and losses over time or between actual and budgeted amounts. Changes in cash flows or income statement line items can also be shown via a waterfall chart. Other non-business applications include tracking demographic and legal activity changes over time.

[[Image:waterfallchart ex3.jpeg|frame|center|alt=Inventory analysis using waterfall chart|Inventory analysis using waterfall chart]]There are several sources for automatic creations of Waterfall Charts ( [[PlusX Excel Add-In|PlusX]] , [[Origin (data analysis software)|Origin]], etc.)

{{No footnotes|date=March 2013}}

'''Wenedyk''' ({{lang-en|'''Venedic'''}}) is a naturalistic [[constructed language]], created by the Dutch translator [[Jan van Steenbergen]] (who also co-created the international auxiliary language [[Interslavic language|Interslavic]]). It is used in the fictional ''Republic of the Two Crowns'' (based on the ''[[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Republic of Two Nations]]''), in the [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate timeline]] of [[Ill Bethisad]]. Officially, Wenedyk is a descendant of [[Vulgar Latin]] with a strong [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] admixture, based on the premise that the [[Roman Empire]] incorporated the ancestors of the [[Poles]] in their territory. Less officially, it tries to show what [[Polish language|Polish]] would have looked like if it had been a [[Romance languages|Romance]] instead of a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] language. On the Internet, it is well-recognized as an example of the [[altlang]] genre, much like [[Brithenig]] and Breathanach.

The idea for the language was inspired by such languages as Brithenig and Breathanach, languages that bear a similar relationship to the Celtic languages as Wenedyk does to Polish. The language itself is based entirely on ([[Vulgar Latin|Vulgar]]) [[Latin]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]: all phonological, morphological, and syntactic changes that made Polish develop from [[Common Slavic language|Common Slavic]] are applied to Vulgar Latin. As a result, vocabulary and morphology are predominantly Romance in nature, whereas phonology, orthography and syntax are essentially the same as in Polish. Wenedyk uses the modern standard [[Polish orthography]], including (for instance) {{angle bracket|w}} for {{IPA|/v/}} and {{angle bracket|ł}} for {{IPA|/w/}}.

Wenedyk plays a role in the [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] of Ill Bethisad, where it is one of the official languages of the [http://steen.free.fr/rtc/index.html Republic of the Two Crowns]. In 2005 Wenedyk underwent a major revision due to a better understanding of Latin and Slavic sound and grammar changes. In the process, the author was assisted by the Polish linguist Grzegorz Jagodziński.

The dictionary on the WWW page linked below contains over 4000 entries.

The language has acquired some media attention in Poland, including a few online news articles and an article in the monthly ''Wiedza i Życie'' ("Knowledge and Life").

== Spelling and pronunciation ==

Wenedyk uses the [[Polish alphabet]], which consists of the following 32 letters :

:'''A Ą B C Ć D E Ę F G H I J K L Ł M N Ń O Ó P R S Ś T U W Y Z Ź Ż'''

Also, there are seven digraphs, representing five phonemes (ch being identical with h, and rz with ż):

:'''Ch Cz Dz Dź Dż Rz Sz'''

Pronunciation is exactly as in Polish. Stress almost always falls on the penultimate [[syllable]]. A [[preposition]] and a [[pronoun]] are generally treated as one word, and therefore, when the pronoun has only one syllable, the preposition is stressed.

(In theory, the construction of Wenedyk enables relatively easy construction of other "Slavo-Romance" languages. The Romance "mirror" for [[Czech language|Czech]], for example, is called "Šležan"; [http://steen.free.fr/slezan/index.html] another for [[Slovak language|Slovak]], although somewhat looser than the other two as it uses a partially [[Hungarian alphabet|Hungarian orthography]], is called "Slevan". [http://wiki.frath.net/Slevan])

== Grammar ==

=== Nouns and adjectives ===
Wenedyk does not have [[article (grammar)|articles]]. This is a feature that distinguishes Wenedyk from all natural Romance languages. The reason for this is that [[Vulgar Latin]] showed only a rudimentary tendency toward the formation of articles, whereas they are absent in Polish and most other Slavic languages.

Nouns, pronouns and adjectives can have three [[grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, neuter), two [[grammatical number|numbers]] (singular, plural), and three [[grammatical case|cases]]:
* the ''direct case'': used for both the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and the [[direct object]] of a sentence. In the sentence: '''''Miej poterz'' leże ''libier''''' "My father reads a book", ''Miej poterz'' "my father" and ''libier'' "a book" are both in the direct case.
* the ''[[genitive case]]'': used to indicate possession, for example: '''siedź ''potrze''''' "''my father's'' chair", '''rzejna ''Anglie''''' "the queen ''of England''".
* the ''[[dative case]]'': used to indicate the [[indirect object]] of a sentence, for example: '''Da ''mi'' ił libier''' "Give ''me'' that book", '''Da ''mi'' łu''' "Give it ''to me''".
Wenedyk also has a ''[[vocative case]]''. In most cases it has the same form as the direct case, but there are exceptions: '''O potrze!''' "Oh father!"

Noun can be subdivided into four [[declension]]s. They are similar to the declension system in Latin:
* the ''first declension'' are all words on '''-a''', the vast majority of which are [[feminine]];
* the ''second declension'' are mostly masculine and neuter words ending with a [[consonant]]. It is a mixture of the second and fourth declension in Latin;
* the ''third declension'' are mostly feminine words ending with a soft consonant;
* the ''fourth declension'' are words on '''-ej''', it matches the Latin fifth declension.

[[Adjective]]s always agree in gender, number and case with the noun they modify. They can be placed both before and after it.

=== Pronouns ===
Unlike nouns, adjectives and other pronouns, [[personal pronoun]]s do not use the direct case, but preserve the distinction between the [[nominative case|nominative]] and [[accusative case|accusative]] instead. They are displayed in the following chart:

|align="center" colspan="3"|''they&lt;br&gt;them&lt;br&gt;theirs&lt;br&gt;to them''
|}

=== Verbs ===
[[Verb]]s are inflected for person, number, mood and tense. The forms in the present tense are:
:''1 sg.'' &amp;ndash; '''jemu''' "I love"
:''2 sg.'' &amp;ndash; '''jemasz''' "you love"
:''3 sg.'' &amp;ndash; '''jema''' "he/she loves"
:''1 pl.'' &amp;ndash; '''jemamy''' "we love"
:''2 pl.'' &amp;ndash; '''jemacie''' "you love"
:''3 pl.'' &amp;ndash; '''jemą''' "they love"
Because Latin and [[Proto-Slavonic]] had virtually identical person/number inflections, Wenedyk and Polish do also.

Wenedyk verbs have the following [[grammatical mood|moods]] and [[grammatical tense|tenses]]:
:''[[infinitive]]'' &amp;ndash; '''jemar''' "to love"
:''[[present tense]]'' &amp;ndash; '''jemu''' "I love, I am loving"
:''[[imperfect]]'' &amp;ndash; '''jemawa''' "I loved"
:''[[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]'' &amp;ndash; '''jemie''' " I have loved"
:''[[future tense]] ([[imperfective aspect|imperfective]])'' &amp;ndash; '''joru jemar''' "I will love, I will be loving"
:''[[future tense]] ([[perfective aspect|perfective]])'' &amp;ndash; '''jemaru''' "I will have loved"
:''[[conditional mood]]'' &amp;ndash; '''jemarsi''' "I would love, I would have loved"
:''[[imperative mood]]'' &amp;ndash; '''jem''' "love!"
:''[[participle|present active participle]] &amp;ndash; '''jemęć''' "loving"
:''[[participle|perfect passive participle]] &amp;ndash; '''jematy''' "beloved"

== Word list ==

Wenedyk vocabulary as published on the internet consists of over 4000 words. Because of how it was developed from Vulgar Latin, Wenedyk words are closest to [[Italian language|Italian]], but with phonologic differences from Italian which may be compared to those distinguishing [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] from [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The following charts of 30 shows what Wenedyk looks like in comparison to a number of other Romance languages; note that unlike [[Brithenig]], where one-quarter of the words resembled Welsh words, only four Wenedyk words (not counting ''szkoła'', borrowed into Polish from Latin) resemble Polish words, due to the Slavic languages' greater distance from the Romance languages compared to the Celtic languages:

In the Ill Bethisad universe, there are two other languages which are related to Wenedyk: Slevan, which is spoken in that universe's counterpart of [[Slovakia]]; and Šležan, or Silesian, spoken in [[Silesia]]. Šležan mirrors [[Czech language|Czech]] [http://steen.free.fr/slezan/index.html] [http://steen.free.fr/slezan/gmp.html] in much the same way Wenedyk does Polish, whereas Slevan, despite being located in Slovakia, is more similar to [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] in its orthography. (The Romance "mirror" of Slovak is a dialect of Slevan spoken in [[Moravia]] called Moravľaňec.) (As if in compensation, [[Croatian language|Croatian]] in Ill Bethisad is forced to be noticeably different from [[Serbian language|Serbian]] by being made to resemble the now-virtually-missing Czech and Slovak. [http://ib.frath.net/w/Croatian] )

Additionally, in the famous ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' series, the fictional language [[Syldavian]] may be thought of as the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] counterpart of Wenedyk, showing what Polish might have looked like if it were a Germanic and not a Slavic language. The nearly extinct [[Wymysorys language]] provides another real-life example of this. Ill Bethisad also has such a "Slavo-Germanic" language: Bohemian, spoken in that universe's [[Czech Republic]], developed by amateur [[Czech people|Czech]] linguist Jan Havliš.
