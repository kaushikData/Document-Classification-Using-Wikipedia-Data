[[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] competed in the second '''[[Asian Test Championship]]''' between August 2001 and March 2002. [[India national cricket team|India]] pulled out of the tournament due to [[2001–02 India–Pakistan standoff|political tensions with Pakistan]].

Pakistan and Sri Lanka both played Bangladesh in the two [[round-robin tournament|round robin matches]]. A win was worth 16 or 12 points, a tie 8 points and no points were awarded for a draw or loss. In addition to this, bonus points were awarded to teams for [[Bowling (cricket)|bowling]] and [[Batting (cricket)|batting]] performances. Pakistan and Sri Lanka qualified for the final after convincingly beating Bangladesh in [[Multan]] and [[Colombo]], respectively.

The final was held at [[Gaddafi Stadium]] in [[Lahore, Pakistan]]. Sri Lanka beat Pakistan by 8 wickets to win the second Asian Test championship.

==Pre-Championship build up==

===India pulls out===
{{see also|2001–02 India–Pakistan standoff}}
The 2001–02 [[Asian Test Championship]] was originally planned to include all four [[Asia]]n [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] [[Test cricket#Test cricket playing nations|full-members]] ([[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]], [[India national cricket team|India]], [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]]). However, before the tournament started, India's participation was put in doubt.

Initially, the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]] requested the [[Asian Cricket Council|ACC]] to change the venue of the final ([[Dhaka]]) of the championship. The BCCI requested that if Bangladesh does not reach the final, the match should not be held in Dhaka, and if India and Pakistan were to meet in the final, it should be held in [[India]], and if an India Sri Lanka final was to take place, it should be held in [[Sri Lanka]]. The BCCI stated that if the venue for the final was not changed it would be difficult for India to participate in the championship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/95911.html] India insists on changing venue for ATC final 5 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, the BCCI commented that India's participation in the championship and selection of the team would depend on permission from the [[Government of India|Indian government]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/96127.html] Selection of team for ATC after government's permission: Lele 11 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; India's delay in confirming their participation in the championship resulted in the ACC threatening that the tournament would go ahead as scheduled without India. However the BCCI reacted strongly to the threat, claiming that "[a] decision will be taken shortly" and that the delay does not "[construe] that India has pulled out of the championship".&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/96468.html] India cannot be bullied into taking part in ATC: Uma Bharti 20 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A week before the championship was scheduled to begin, the BCCI announced that India would not participate in the tournament. This decision was reported to have been taken by the [[Indian Prime Minister]] [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] and other government ministers after a meeting with the BCCI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/96555.html] ACC unhappy over decision 22 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely understood that India's withdrawal was due to [[2001–02 India–Pakistan standoff|political tensions]] between India and Pakistan. Indian sports minister [[Uma Bharti]] stated that cricketing ties between the two countries would resume after the normalization of political Indo-Pak ties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/96592.html] Cricketing ties will resume only after normalisation of Indo-Pak ties: Bharti 23 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Indian players' security and safety in Pakistan was also noted to be the major concern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/96630.html] Dawood was behind India's pull out from ATC: Bharti 24 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

As expected, the ACC reacted angrily over India's decision, however it was confirmed that the tournament would be rescheduled and go on with only three teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/96538.html] ACC unhappy over decision 22 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jagmohan Dalmiya]], the chairman of the ACF, the marketing arm of the ACC, described the government's decision not to allow the Indian team to participate in the Asian Test Championship as an internal matter:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is purely an internal matter between the Government of India and the Indian Cricket Board. The ACC or the ACF has no jurisdiction to deal with the respective governments. I have no comment to make on the decision"&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/96555.html] India's decision `internal matter': Dalmiya 22 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Pakistan Cricket Board|PCB]] expressed regret over India's decision not to participate in the championship. The PCB chairman, Lt. Gen. [[Tauqir Zia]] was dismayed over the Indian government's decision to go back on their commitment, which was a guarantee that India would have no objection playing [[multilateralism|multilateral]] tournaments which included Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/96595.html] Pakistan's dismay on India's non-participation Pakistan Cricket Board 22 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

It was expected the ICC to sanction or fine the BCCI for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/96584.html] India's absence unfortunate, say captains 29 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The ACC and PCB were expected to experience a financial downfall due to India's decision. Pakistan in particular were unhappy since [[Pakistani cricket team in India in 1998-99|Pakistan's tour of India in 1999]] helped raised millions of [[United States dollar|dollars]] in revenue for the BCCI. India had already cancelled a tour earlier in the year to Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/97352.html] Imran urges ICC to penalize India 31 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, after the first Test, the [[Bangladesh Cricket Board]] reported that they were fearing bankruptcy due to India's withdrawal from the tournament. The director of the BCB, [[Ashraf-ul-Haq]] commented that funds that would have been generated by the ACC from the championship would be used to invest in Bangladesh cricket as well as other minor countries, without which the BCB faced serious financial problems. Ashraf planned on condemning the BCCI in the following ICC executive and ACC meetings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/109656.html] BCB faces bankruptcy 1 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pakistan Cricket Board]] protested the appointment of [[John Richard Reid|John Reid]] as match referee for the 1st match of the 2001–02 Asian Test Championship. John Reid had been involved in controversies involving the Pakistan team; he had fined and suspended [[Waqar Younis]] and [[Azhar Mahmood]] for [[ball tampering]] and had been involved in reporting [[Shoaib Akhtar]]'s suspect [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]] action to the ICC.

Pakistan used the precedent that Sri Lanka had successfully removed [[Australian]] [[umpire (cricket)|umpire]] [[Darrell Hair]] from their matches during the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]]. Hair had called Sri Lankan [[off-spinner]] [[Muttiah Muralitharan]] for throwing during a tour of [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]].&lt;ref name="content-usa.cricinfo.com"&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/newzealand/content/story/96490.html] Match referee John Reid draws protest from Pakistan Lynn McConnell 21 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ICC policies do not permit any member country to veto the appointment of independent referees or umpires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/96509.html] ICC confirms John Reid appointment for Asian Test Championship ICC Media Release 21 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The ICC rejected Pakistan's formal complaint, and the ICC [[Chief Executive Officer]] [[Malcolm Speed]] assured that the PCB had confirmed that 
John Reid would receive the same courtesies that are extended to all ICC officials visiting [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/96535.html] ICC rejects Pakistan protest 22 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

John Reid did not comment on the protest, but expressed disappointment and that he was still available to go to the match and do the job he had been appointed to.&lt;ref name="content-usa.cricinfo.com"/&gt;

[[Wasim Akram]] and [[Mushtaq Ahmed (cricketer)|Mushtaq Ahmed]] were left out of the initial [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] training squad before the tournament.

==Scoring system==
The scoring system used for the 2001–02 Asian Test Championship was a revised version of the first system used in the [[1998-99 Asian Test Championship]]. The [[Asian Cricket Council]] approved the revisions brought forward by the technical committee compromising of [[Sunil Gavaskar]] (India), [[Zaheer Abbas]](Pakistan), [[Ashantha De Mel]] (Sri Lanka) and [[Gazi Ashraf]] (Bangladesh). Points for winning the match were kept at 12, however additional points were given for an innings victory. Points for a tie were increased from 6 to 8.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/96463.html] ACC approves points system for ATC 20 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonus points were awarded to teams for good [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]] and [[batting (cricket)|batting]] performances (''see table below''). A maximum of 24 points could be gained in one match (including the 16 match winning points). The bonus bowling and batting points were confined to the first 100 overs of the first innings. The two teams with the highest number of points qualify for the final. If two teams are tied on points, the team with a better [[run rate]] in the first 100 overs will go through. If the final ends in a draw, the side with the higher bonus points will win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/79323.html] Points at stake in the Asian Test Championship 11 February 1999 By Our Special Representative&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2001–02 Championship, the bonus point system was changed, 400+ runs and 10 wickets to achieve maximum points (increased for 350+ and 9–10 from the previous championship).

==1st Test: Pakistan v Bangladesh==

The first [[Test cricket|Test match]] of the Championship was between Bangladesh and Pakistan. It was held in [[Multan]], at the newly renovated $2.5&amp;nbsp;million [[Multan Cricket Stadium]]. This was the first Test match to be held in Multan since [[West Indian cricket team in Pakistan in 1980-81|1980–81]] when the [[West Indian national cricket team|West Indies]] drew a match with Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chughtai|first1=Arshad|title=Multan regains Test Status|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/97263.html|work=ESPN Cricinfo|date=28 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being the first match in the stadium, the nature of the [[Cricket pitch|pitch]] and ground was unknown, however a result was expected.&lt;ref name="cricinfo2001"&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/97269.html] ATC Test: Pakistan favourites in the heat at Multan (Preview) Rafi Nasim 28 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the first Test match between the two sides. The previous international cricket match between the two sides was at the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]] when Bangladesh upset Pakistan to win its first [[One Day International]] against a Test team. Bangladesh was granted [[Test cricket#Test cricket playing nations|Test status]] only 14 months prior to the championship; this was their fourth Test match, having played [[India national cricket team|India]] [[Indian cricket team in Bangladesh in 2000–01|once]] and [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] [[Zimbabwean cricket team in Bangladesh in 2001–02|twice]] losing on all three occasions.&lt;ref name="cricinfo2001"/&gt; Before the match, Bangladesh [[Captain (cricket)|captain]] had ruled out the possibility of a repeat upset&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/97287.html] Repeat of 1999 World Cup unlikely: Naimur 29 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Batsman|batsmen]] [[Al Sahariar]] revealed that the aim for the team was to play the full five days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/96247.html] Al-Sahariar wants to play five full days Shahryar Khan 14 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The Bangladesh team had engaged notable former cricketers [[Javed Miandad]] of Pakistan, [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Andy Roberts]] of West Indies and [[Trevor Chappell]] of Australia as coaches, to strengthen their side. However, [[monsoon]] weather had hampered their preparations for the tournament.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

For Pakistan, [[Saqlain Mushtaq]] was left out of the side due domestic conflicts in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/96652.html] Saqlain misses Asian Test 25 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taufeeq Umar]] and [[Shoaib Malik]] were included in the initial 16-man squad; both players earned their first Test cap in this match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/96940.html] Taufiq hopes to justify his selection 26 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wasim Akram]], initially left out of the 27-man training squad, was included in the final 16 and 11, taking [[Shoaib Akhtar]]'s place, after a positive performance in a [[First-class cricket|first-class match]] between PCB XI and Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/96958.html] Selectors eat humble pie and name Wasim in 16-man squad Samiul Hasan 26 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan entered the match as clear favorites, despite having failed to win a Test series at home since 1997, when Wasim Akram captained the side to a [[West Indian cricket team in Pakistan in 1997-98|3–0 whitewash]] over the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]]. Since then, Pakistan has lost series against [[Zimbabwean cricket team in Pakistan in 1998–99|Zimbabwe]], [[Sri Lankan cricket team in Pakistan in 1999–2000|Sri Lanka]], [[English cricket team in Pakistan in 2000–01|England]] and [[Australian cricket team in Pakistan in 1998–99|Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/97288.html] Complacency Pakistan's biggest enemy Samiul Hasan 29 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Day 1===

Bangladesh won the toss and elected to bat, however they made a poor start to the match, being bowled out for 134 in 41.1 overs. None of the Bangladeshi batsmen scored 20 runs, while [[Danish Kaneria]] took 6 wickets. Pakistan made a confident start to their innings, reaching 219/2 at the end of the day. [[Saeed Anwar]] top scored on the day, making 101 from 104 deliveries. He reach 4000 Test runs in this innings, joining the likes of [[Javed Miandad]], [[Saleem Malik]], [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]], [[Zaheer Abbas]] and [[Mudassar Nazar]] as the only Pakistanis to do so.

===Day 2===

Pakistan added to their overnight score on the 2nd day, amassing a total of 546/3 (declared), creating a 412 first innings lead. Five players scored centuries: Saeed Anwar (101), [[Taufeeq Umar]](104), [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]] (105*), [[Yousuf Youhana]] (102*) and [[Abdul Razzaq (Pakistani cricket player)|Abdul Razzaq]] (110*). Taufeeq Umar became the 8th Pakistani batsmen to score a century on debut, while Razzaq's was the second fastest century by a Pakistani (after [[Majid Khan (cricketer, born 1946)|Majid Khan]]). Inzamam-ul-Haq [[retired hurt]] ([[dehydration]]) when the score was at 381/3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/97337.html] With 5 centuries in an innings Pakistan maul Bangladesh Rafi Nasim 30 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh started their innings on the 2nd day with 19 overs remaining. They closed at 55/3 with [[Habibul Bashar]] not out on 19.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/2001-02/ASIA-TEST/SCORECARDS/BDESH_PAK_ASIA-TEST_T1_29AUG-02SEP2001.html] Test # 1560 Asian Test Championship, 2001–02, 1st Match Pakistan v Bangladesh Multan Cricket Stadium&lt;/ref&gt;

===Day 3===

Pakistan won the match when Bangladesh were bowled out on the 3rd day; Man of the Match, Kaneria took 6/52 for a career best match total of 12/94. Habibul Bashar was the only batsmen to offer any resistance, scoring an unbeaten 56.

===Reaction===

Pakistan established four unique records in the match:&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/110115.html] Four unique records established at Multan Kamran Sekha 3 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
# Five players scored centuries in one innings
# Saeed Anwar and Taufeeq Umar became the first left-handed opening pair to both score centuries
# For the second time in Test history two separate century partnerships for the same wicket in the same innings were recorded. Inzamam-ul-Haq and Yousuf Youhana added 123 (unbroken) for the fourth wicket and then Yousuf Youhana and Abdur Razzaq added 165 (unbroken) for the fourth wicket. The latter partnership is considered "fourth" wicket because Inzamam-ul-Haq retired hurt and was not out.
# The Pakistan v Bangladesh and the concurrent Sri Lanka v India ([[Indian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2001|3rd Test at Colombo]]) Test matches provided the unique feat of centuries on test debuts on successive days in two separate Test matches.

Additionally, the Test match was the hottest ever, with temperatures in excess of 38 degrees Celsius (100 degree Fahrenheit) on each day.

Wasim Akram was criticised by the media for a poor performance in which he did not take a wicket. However [[Captain (cricket)|skipper]] Waqar Younis backed Akram saying that he was unlucky with a couple of dropped chances. Bangladesh coach [[Trevor Chappell]] and captain [[Naimur Rahman]] were critical of the Tigers batting performance. Chappell also added that Kaneria did not "deserve" 12 wickets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/109651.html] Waqar backs Wasim 1 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, it was reported that [[Saeed Anwar]]'s young daughter died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/109713.html] Saeed Anwar's young daughter dies 1 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; This event led to his eventual move away from cricket.

Pakistan received the maximum 24 points for their victory; 16 for winning by an innings and 4 each for batting and bowling performances. Bangladesh received no points:

==2nd Test: Sri Lanka v Bangladesh==

The second Test of the Championship was held at the [[Sinhalese Sports Club Ground]] in [[Colombo]] between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. It was the first Test between the two sides and to mark the occasion, the [[Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka]] (BCCSL) allowed free entry at five enclosures at the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Free Entrance for Inaugural Bangladesh Test|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/97377.html|work=ESPN Cricinfo|date=31 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BCCSL also established prize money for the match, with the winning team earning [[Sri Lankan rupee|SLR]] 70,000, the losing team SLR 40,000 and the [[Man of the Match]] earning SLR 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/110256.html] Prizes at Asian Test Championship match BCCSL 5 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

This Test was the second meeting of the two sides in [[international cricket]]; Sri Lanka beat Bangladesh in an ODI during the [[1997 Asia Cup]]. Prior to this match, Bangladesh had lost four Test matches in a row, and their coach [[Trevor Chappell]] was expecting this Test to be a learning experience for the side rather than an opportunity to win their first match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/srilanka/content/story/110168.html] Chappell wants players to learn from Sri Lankan experience CricInfo 5 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Following Bangladesh's batting collapse in the first match of the championship against [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] at the hands of [[leg spinner]] [[Danish Kaneria]], Bangladesh was expected to perform better with the bat, especially against the in-form [[Muralitharan]] who took 23 wickets in [[Indian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2001|3 Tests against India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://usa.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/2001/IND_IN_SL/STATS/IND_IN_SL_JUL-SEP2001_TEST_AVS.html] India in Sri Lanka, 2001 Test Series Averages&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri Lanka entered the match after a 2–1 [[Indian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2001|series win over India]]. [[Sanath Jayasuriya]], the Sri Lanka captain warned ahead of the game that his team can not afford to relax and was expecting good performance against the newest Test nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/srilanka/content/story/110166.html] Sanath Jayasuriya warns against complacency Carlie Austin 5 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, Sri Lanka have had a winning record at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground,&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/srilanka/engine/records/team/results_summary.html?class=1;id=679;type=ground] Sinhalese Sports Club Ground, Colombo – Test matches&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Chaminda Vaas]] and Muralitharan taking career bests at this venue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/srilanka/content/ground/59308.html] Sinhalese Sports Club Colombo, Sri Lanka&lt;/ref&gt; The pitch was not expected to deteriorate in the first three days and was assumed to support fast bowlers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/srilanka/content/story/110167.html] Both sides make changes before inaugural Test Rex Clementine 5 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, under-performing batsman [[Russel Arnold]] and fast bowler [[Dulip Liyanage]] were replaced by [[Michael Vandort]] and [[Ruchira Perera]] respectively.

==Final: Pakistan v Sri Lanka==
After both Pakistan and Sri Lanka defeated Bangladesh in their respective [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] matches, the two teams agreed to play a straight final instead of their meaningless round-robin match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lanka and Pakistan go straight to final of Asian Test Championship|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/114258.html|work=ESPN Cricinfo|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PCB and [[Sri Lanka Cricket|Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka]] agreed to play the final match at [[Gaddafi Stadium]] in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]]. It marked the return of [[international cricket]] to Pakistan after the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 US invasion of Afghanistan]] prompted the cancellation of tours by [[New Zealand cricket team in Pakistan in 2001–02|New Zealand]] and [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]], and the rescheduling of the [[West Indian cricket team in Pakistan in 2001–02|West Indies series to Sharjah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Asian Test Championship final to be held in Pakistan|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/116067.html|work=ESPN Cricinfo|date=30 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mascot==
[[File:Joemy.JPG|thumb|95px|Joemy]]
The mascot for 2011, Joemy, was unveiled on 27 August 2009 after a public vote by mail, email, fax and SMS (with nearly 8,000 voters). An initial sketch by a pupil from Jules Garnier High School in Nouméa was transformed into a three dimensionsal cartoon character by graphic designers at ''Banana Studio'' in Nouméa.&lt;ref name= mascot-2011/&gt;

Joemy is a blue [[flying fox]] in orange shorts. Her name was intended as an "invitation", chosen for its proximity to the local [[Drehu language|Drehu]] word ''troemi'' (pronounced "chôémi" which means "come") and the English phrase "join me". The flying fox is an animal that is endemic to New Caledonia. The colour blue was chosen as representing the ocean surrounding all of the 22 island countries taking part in the Games.&lt;ref name= mascot-2011/&gt;

==Sporting events==
There were 27 sports contested at the 2011 Games:

# Cricket -  all matches were deemed by the International Cricket Council as "Official Internationals" meaning that participating countries had the opportunity to move up into a higher ICC membership category &lt;ref name="sportingpulse"/&gt;
# Football - the men's event was supposed to be the first stage qualification for the FIFA 2014 World Cup in Brazil and the women's event was supposed to be the first stage qualification for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. However, in June 2011 the format was amended, and the Pacific Games were no longer part of the qualification process.
# Tennis - the Oceania Tennis Federation used the Pacific Games as an official selection event for the Pacific Oceania Davis Cup (Men) and Federation Cup (Women) teams &lt;ref name="sportingpulse"/&gt;

The '''2011 Winter Deaflympics''' officially known as the 17th Winter Deaflympics was originally scheduled to be held from 18 February 2011 to 26 February 2011 in [[Vysoke Tatry]], [[Slovakia]]. This was the first time that Slovakia was selected to host a Deaflympic event. But the multi-sporting event was cancelled due to the lack of preparations, lack of readiness and reluctance by the [[Deaflympic Committee of Slovakia]] prior to the event. The event was also cancelled mainly due to the alleged fraud by the former President of the Deaflympic Committee of Slovakia, [[Jaromir Ruda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://limpingchicken.com/2013/07/24/deaf-news-organiser-of-the-failed-2011-winter-deaflympics-sentenced-to-prison-for-fraud/|title=Deaf News: Organiser of the failed 2011 Winter Deaflympics sentenced to prison for fraud|date=2013-07-24|work=The Limping Chicken|access-date=2017-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Winter Games was cancelled and was postponed to 2015, which was the 17th Winter Deaflympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.disabled-world.com/sports/deaflympics/officially-cancelled.php|title=Slovakia Winter Deaflympics Officially Declared Cancelled|work=Disabled World|access-date=2017-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics-sochi-old/winter-deaf-games-cancellation-met-with-anger-1.990271|title=Winter deaf games cancellation met with anger|work=CBC Sports|access-date=2017-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bidding and organization ==
[[Vysoke Tatry]] was selected as the host city for the 17th Winter Deaflympics which was approved by the 39th Congress of International Committee of Sports for the Deaf on 4 January,2005 in [[Australia]], [[Melbourne]] just before the [[2005 Summer Deaflympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deaflympics.com/icsd.asp?614|title=39th Congress of ICSD {{!}} Deaflympics|last=|first=|date=|website=www.deaflympics.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;About 438 athletes and 25 countries were estimated to compete in the multi-sport event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://spravy.pravda.sk/domace/clanok/169343-z-olympiady-su-zatial-len-sluby/|title=Z olympiády sú zatiaľ len sľuby|date=2011-02-10|work=Pravda.sk|access-date=2017-11-01|language=sk-SK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://storify.com/paulocosta/deaflympics|title=Winter Deaflympic Games Fiasco - Slovakia 2011|website=Storify|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crisis and controversies ==
The 2011 Winter Games was also temporarily cancelled by the [[Comite International des Sports des Sourds]] on the 11th of May, 2010 due to the delay in arrangements for the commencement of the Winter Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deaflympics.com/news.asp?1536|title=News {{!}} Deaflympics|website=www.deaflympics.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalvoices.org/2011/02/11/slovakia-deaflympics-2011-controversy/|title=Slovakia: Deaflympics 2011 Controversy · Global Voices|date=2011-02-11|work=Global Voices|access-date=2017-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ukdeafsport.org.uk/icsd-statement-on-2011-winter-deaflympics/|title=ICSD statement on 2011 Winter Deaflympics {{!}} UK Deaf Sport|website=ukdeafsport.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;Apart from the lack of preparations, it was revealed that the President of the Deaflympic Organizing Committee of Slovakia involved in the fraud scam (accused of diverting in excess of 1.7 million euros) relating to the funds which was transferred to the Deaflympic Committee of Slovakia by other national deaf sports federations was misused by the Committee and the President of the Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/deaflympics-the-rubbish-tycoon-and-the-games-that-were-dumped-2266957.html|title=Deaflympics: The rubbish tycoon and the games that were dumped|date=2011-04-13|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://spravy.pravda.sk/domace/clanok/169380-deaflympiadu-zrusili-slovensko-ma-svetovu-hanbu/|title=Deaflympiádu zrušili, Slovensko má svetovú hanbu|date=2011-02-14|work=Pravda.sk|access-date=2017-11-01|language=sk-SK}}&lt;/ref&gt;The ICSD filed a criminal complaint against him and against the Committee demanding the reimbursement of the funds in order to cover the hotel accommodations and other relevant expenditures for the arrangement of the multi-sporting event.

== Overview ==
=== Format ===
During the initial round-robin stage, played over 14 weeks, each team plays every other team once, and teams from their home country a second time, with one bye somewhere between Rounds 5–12 inclusive. Teams are awarded 2 points for each win, and 0 points for a loss. Tournament rules do not allow draws; matches that are tied at the end of regular time will extend into extra time until a winner emerges. In 2012, round 6 will be the designated Rivalry Round. At the end of the round-robin stage, the four teams with the highest points will progress to the finals stage. If two or more teams have the same number of points, they are sorted by goal percentage.

The top four teams from the round-robin stage progress to the finals stage, played over three weeks in a [[Page-McIntyre System]]. The 1st-ranked team (who receive the minor premiership) will play the 2nd-ranked team in the major semi-final, while 3rd plays 4th in the minor semi-final. The winner of the major semi-final advances to the grand final; the losing team progresses to the preliminary final, and will host the winner of the minor semi-final. The grand final will be contested in late July, between the winners of the major semi-final and the preliminary final.

== Offseason ==
{{See also|2012 ANZ Championship transfer period}}
Players became available for transfer talks one week after the conclusion of the [[2011 ANZ Championship season|2011 season]]. Teams had to submit their final rosters for the 2012 season by 1 November 2011.

In contrast to previous years, only one pre-season tournament was held in 2012. For the first time since 2008, all ten teams compete at the same tournament, which was held on 2–4 March at [[TECT Arena]] in [[Tauranga]], New Zealand. The new multisport venue was opened in mid-2011 and will also host several regular season matches for the [[Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tauranga to host 2012 ANZ Championship pre-season tournament |author=TTNL |url=http://www.anz-championship.com/news/a/tauranga-to-host-2012-anz-championship-pre-season-tournament/741 |date=3 November 2011 |accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Batavia Downs''' is a [[harness racing]] [[Race track|track]]  and casino in [[Batavia (city), New York|Batavia]], [[New York (state)|New York]].  It is located in [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee County]] between [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] just off of the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90 in New York|Interstate 90]]).  It opened on September 20, 1940, and is the oldest lighted harness racetrack in the United States.  The track is exactly {{convert|.5|mi|km}} long.

==History==
In 1939, William "Lefty" Goldberg and others chose Batavia, halfway between Buffalo and Rochester, for par-mutuel wagering on horse races.  Harold Wishman, William Zimmer, Arthur Martin and Frederick Strohm were stockholders in the Monroe-Genesee Breeders Association, a predecessor to the Genesee-Monroe Racing Association, which rented the Genesee County Fairgrounds for racing.

===1940s===
In 1940, Batavia Downs opened pari-mutuel racing at 8:20 PM on September 20, 1940.  Crowds of more than 2,500 attended and $10,411 was wagered on the first card.

In 1941, Batavia Downs opened to an estimated crowd of about 4,000 and a handle of $20,231.  Track lighting was improved.

The season was cancelled in 1942 and 1943 because of war travel restrictions. 
   
In 1944, [[Pat E. Provenzano]] borrowed money and bought out stockholder William Weisman, a New York City attorney, for $15,000. Provenzano was elected president of the Genesee Monroe Racing Association. 
   
In 1947, Provenzano purchased the racetrack property for $150,000 after the Genesee County Agricultural Society's fair association went bankrupt. Proximity set the then-track record of 2:04. In 1948 she broke her own time record with a time of 1:59 3/5.

===1950s===
In 1959, Bye Bye Byrd beat Tar Boy and equaled the world record for a half-mile track, 159.2.  Attendance for this race was 9,633.

===1960s===
In 1962, a fire devastated the stables, killing a caretaker, 26 horses, and causing an estimated $625,000 in damages, not including lost revenues. The Downs underwent extensive renovations to prevent fires.
   
In 1963, Batavia Downs welcomed its eight millionth visitor.

'''Canoe polo''', also known as '''Kayak polo''', is one of the competitive disciplines of [[kayaking]], known simply as "polo" by its aficionados. Polo combines boating and ball handling skills with a contact team game, where tactics and positional play are as important as the speed and fitness of the individual athletes.

The game requires excellent teamwork and promotes both general canoeing skills and a range of other techniques unique to the sport. Each team has five players on the pitch (and up to three substitutes), who compete to score in their opponents goal which is suspended two metres above the water. The ball can be thrown by hand, or flicked with the paddle to pass between players and shoot at the goal. Pitches can be set up in swimming pools or any stretch of flat water.

The kayaks are specifically designed for polo and are faster and lighter than typical kayaks which give them superior maneuverability. The blades of a polo paddle have thick rounded edges to prevent injury. Paddles are also very lightweight and designed with both pulling power and ball control in mind. Nose and tail boat bumpers, body protection, helmets and face-guards are all compulsory.

In [[International Canoe Federation]] nomenclature used in some European countries, chiefly the [[United Kingdom]], the term canoe can refer to a [[kayak]] too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Canoe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boats in this game are paddled with a double-bladed paddle and are called "kayaks".

== History ==
The birth of the modern sport could be considered to be the demonstration event held at the National Canoe Exhibition at the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre]], London, in 1970.

In response to the interest created at the Crystal Palace event, the first National Canoe Polo subcommittee of the [[British Canoe Union]] was formed, and it was this committee that developed the modern framework of the game. The National Championships were held every year at the National Canoe Exhibition, and this activity led on to the inclusion of Canoe Polo in the demonstration games at [[Duisburg]], [[Germany]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nomadkayakclub.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Canoe-polo-history.pdf |first=Ian |last=Beasley |title=Boat, Paddle and Ball: a short history of canoe polo |year=2009 |accessdate=2 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
The game is now played in many countries throughout all inhabited continents, for recreation and serious sport. The sport has World Championships every two years and European, Asian, African, and PanAmerican Continental Championships held every year in between World Championship years. Internationally the sport is organized by the Canoe Polo committee of the [[International Canoe Federation]], as one of the disciplines of the sport of canoeing.

[[File:Canoe Polo.jpg|thumbnail|Finnish canoe polo championships, [[Lahti]], Finland, 2010]]

[[File:Canoe polo practice.JPG|thumb|right|Practicing on the [[River Cam]], England, 2004]]

The game is often described as a combination of [[water polo]], [[basketball]] and [[kayaking]]. The tactics and playing of the game are not unlike basketball or water polo but with the added complexity of the boats, which can be used to tackle an opposition player in possession of the ball, or jostle for position within 6&amp;nbsp;meters of the goal.

=== Officials ===
There are two referees (one on each side-line) and they are on foot rather than in boats. The score is kept by the scorekeeper and the timekeeper monitors the playing time and sending-off times. The goal lines are monitored by two line judges. Before play commences scrutineers check all kit for compliance with regulations.

=== Pitch ===
Canoe polo is played either indoors in swimming pools or outdoors on a pitch which should measure 35 meters by 23 meters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canoeicf.com/dms/icf/documents/Disciplines/CAP/Rules/Appendix-3---Field_Diagram/Appendix%203%20-%20Field_Diagram.pdf ICF field diagram]. canoeicf.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203043527/http://www.canoeicf.com/dms/icf/documents/Disciplines/CAP/Rules/Appendix-3---Field_Diagram/Appendix%203%20-%20Field_Diagram.pdf |date=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The boundaries of the pitch are ideally marked using [[floating rope]]s (similar to lane markers in swimming), although for smaller venues the edges of the pool are frequently used.

The area approximately 6&amp;nbsp;meters in front of each the goal can be defined as the Zone. This area is where defending players create formations to defend the goal from attackers.

=== Timing ===
The game is officially played as a 14- to 20-minute game consisting of two 7- to 10-minute halves. The teams change ends at the half-time period, which is 1 to 3 minutes long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canoeicf.com/dms/icf/documents/Disciplines/CAP/Rules/Canoe-Polo-Rules-2013---14/Canoe%20Polo%20Rules%202013%20%26%2014.pdf ICF Rules] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018011446/http://www.canoeicf.com/dms/icf/documents/Disciplines/CAP/Rules/Canoe-Polo-Rules-2013---14/Canoe%20Polo%20Rules%202013%20%26%2014.pdf# |date=2013-10-18 }}. canoeicf.com&lt;/ref&gt; Each half begins with a "sprint" where each team lines up against its goal-line and the ball is thrown into the middle of the pitch by the referee. One player from each team sprints to win possession of the ball.

=== Shot clock ===
A shot clock may be used to speed up the game. The attacking team have 60 seconds to have a shot on the goal or they lose possession. The shot clock is reset when the ball is intercepted by the opposing team or the attacking team loses possession. The shot clock is a recent addition to the rules, and due to the expense and complexity of the equipment is not used universally.

== Tactics ==
There are several attacking and defensive tactics all with different variations.

=== Offensive ===
*'''Overload''':  1 or 2 players attack the side of the zone, pushing the defensive players together and creating space for a 3rd player to sprint into the newly created space, receive a pass from the 4th player and take a direct shot on the goal.
*'''Box player''': A player positions themselves directly under the goal, next to the keeper. The aim is to keep this position and to receive  a quick pass and then have a short, direct shot at the goal or pass to another player who takes the opportunity to break through the defence.
*'''Star''': The players position themselves around the zone and sprint in consecutively, a defensive player moves to block each player as they sprint in,  the attacking team move the ball around as the players sprint in, threatening to take a shot. If done correctly the fifth player is able to sprint into the zone, will have no defensive player to block them, receive the pass from the 4th player and be able to take a direct shot on goal.

=== Defensive ===
*'''3–1''': Three players form a row above the goal keeper, 1 to each side and 1 directly above the keeper. This formation can provide a very solid defensive line, by protecting the sides and the middle. The remaining player patrols the top of the zone with the aim of pressuring the ball and stopping players running into gaps in the defensive line.
*'''2–2''': Two players position themselves in front, and to the side of the goal keeper, and block attacking players threatening the goal from the side. The two other players go further forward and towards the middle with the aim of stopping players running in to the zone and to place pressure of the attackers.  Looked on from above, it is not dissimilar to a Christmas tree formation. The aim is to force long-shots and errors from the attackers to win the ball back, while protecting the goal.
*'''Five or out''': Every player, including the goal keeper, marks a player and pressures the ball and every pass, trying to force a mistake or gain an interception.

== Fouls ==
Most of the rules concern the safety of the players involved or are designed to keep the game fast-paced and exciting to play and watch.

*'''Illegal substitution and entry into the playing area''': Only 5 players are allowed in the playing area at once. During a substitution a player must be completely off the pitch (including all kit) before another player can come on.
*'''Illegal possession''': A player must dispose of the ball within five (5) seconds of gaining possession, either by passing it to another player or by performing one throw causing the ball to travel by at least one metre measured horizontally from the point of release.
*'''Illegal hand tackle''': Types of hand tackle include any hand-tackle where the tackled player does not have possession of the ball or is sharing possession of the ball with another player or any body-contact other than one open hand to the opponents’ back, upper arm or side or any hand tackle which endangers the tackled player.
*'''Illegal kayak tackle''': Any kayak-tackle that results in significant contact between the tackler's kayak and the head or body of an opposing player, or endangering a player, tackling a player not within 3&amp;nbsp;metres of the ball or who is not competing for the ball.
*'''Illegal use of the paddle''': Playing, or attempting to play, the ball with a paddle when the ball is within arm's reach of an opponent, contacting an opponent's person or any use of a paddle that endangers a player.
*'''Illegal jostle''': When a player is stationary or attempting to maintain a position and their body is moved by more than half a metre by sustained contact from an opponent's kayak or jostling the player behind the goal line.
*'''Illegal screen/obstruction''': A player actively or deliberately impeding the progress of an opponent when neither player is within three  metres of the ball or a player who is not competing for the ball who actively impedes the progress of an opponent who is competing for the ball on the water and not in the air.
*'''Illegal holding''': A player gaining support or propulsion by placing their hand, arm, body or paddle on an opponent's kayak, or holding the opposing player or their equipment or using surrounding pitch equipment (goal, side-lines, pool wall), fending off an opponent.
*'''Unsporting behaviour''': Players showing dissent, retaliation, foul or abusive language, delaying tactics, interference with opponents equipment, bouncing the ball out of play or any action that the referees consider detrimental to the game.

Three general principles can be applied when determining the severity of a foul.

'''Deliberate foul''' – A foul where no effort was made to avoid the illegal play. Any deliberate foul should receive a minimum of a green card- either immediately or at the next break in play if playing advantage.

'''Dangerous foul''' – Is significant contact with the opponent's arm, head or body that may result in personal injury and is illegal.

'''Significant contact''' – Any high impact or continuous contact, that may result in equipment damage or personal injury.

== Equipment ==
{{double image|right|Polobal.jpg|70|NewWaterPoloBall.JPG|90|Water polo balls: old (left) and new designs.}}
Specialized equipment is needed to play Canoe polo. Items required are:
*'''Ball''': A [[water polo ball]] is constructed of buoyant material to allow it to float on the water. The cover is textured to give players additional grip. The size of the ball is different for men's, women's and junior games.
*'''Buoyancy aids''': A [[buoyancy aid]] is used to protect the players' torso from injury, and must provide an inch of foam on the front, sides and back of the player. All buoyancy aids are numbered to make the player identifiable to the other players, referees and spectators. Buoyancy aids are reversible and are colored with the teams primary and secondary colors on each side. This allows opponents to reverse their buoyancy aids and play in their away colors if the opposing teams primary color is the same or similar.
*'''Helmet and face guard''': Helmets and face-guards are compulsory to protect players head and face from injury caused by accidental contact from paddles or other kayaks.
*'''Goals''': The goals (measuring 1 meter high by 1.5 meters wide) are a frame with a net, suspended 2 meters above the water. A player, acting as goal keeper, defends the goal with their paddle by sticking it up vertically. Special rules concern the goal keeper, such as: the attacking team not being allowed to interfere with or jostle them. The length of the paddles used by the goal keepers are often longer than those used by other players. [[File:Canoe Polo Kayak.jpg|thumb|right|Canoe polo kayak]]
*'''Kayak''': A special [[kayak]] is used. They are constructed from carbon-kevlar or a similarly lightweight material. This makes them faster and more maneuverable than other kayaks. They are fitted with an inch of protective foam around both ends of the kayak to prevent injury and damage at high speeds.
*'''Paddle''': A [[paddle]] is used to propel the players during the game. The paddle can be used to flick and play the ball. Paddles are strictly forbidden of being played within hands reach of an opposing player to reduce the risk of injury.
*'''Spray deck''': A [[spray deck]] is used to secure the cockpit of the kayak and prevent water filling the kayak during play.

'''Charlotte Speedway''' was the site of [[NASCAR]]'s first Strictly Stock (now [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]]) race on June 19, 1949. The [[Daytona Beach Road Course]] held the first race sanctioned by NASCAR in 1948. The track was a few miles west of the [[NASCAR Hall of Fame]], on Little Rock Road.  It was owned by Carl C. Allison Sr. and his wife, Catherine Montgomery Allison. The track was forced to close when construction of Interstate 85 took its parking area.

==Event details==
Charlotte Speedway was a three-quarter mile long [[Dirt track racing|dirt track]]. The first event in 1949 was a {{convert|150|mi|km|sing=on}} race. Other events were 100, 113, or {{convert|150|mi|km}} long.

==NASCAR history==
Twelve events were held at the track between 1949 and 1956. Winners at the track include: [[Jim Roper]] (1), [[Tim Flock]] (1), [[Curtis Turner]] (2), [[Herb Thomas]] (2), [[Dick Passwater]] (1), [[Buck Baker]] (3), [[Fonty Flock]] (1), and [[Speedy Thompson]] (1).

===1949===
{{main|1949 NASCAR Strictly Stock Series Race 1}}
[[Bob Flock]] won the pole. [[Glenn Dunaway]] was declared the original winner, but a post-race inspection revealed that his car was fitted with illegal springs, causing NASCAR to disqualify him. [[Jim Roper]] was declared the official winner of the event. Roper would only compete in one more NASCAR event in his career. Other famous drivers to finish in the Top 10 include: [[Fonty Flock]], [[Red Byron]], [[Tim Flock]], and [[Curtis Turner]]. Famous drivers to finish outside of the Top 10 include: [[Buck Baker]], [[Jack Smith (NASCAR driver)|Jack Smith]], [[Lee Petty]], [[Herb Thomas]], and [[Bob Flock]]. [[Sara Christian]] finished 14th to become the first female to start in a NASCAR race.

'''Cramton Bowl''' is a 25,000-seat [[stadium]] located in [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. Cramton Bowl opened in 1922 as a [[Baseball park|baseball stadium]] and has been home to [[Major League Baseball]] [[spring training]], and to [[minor league baseball]]. Today, however, its primary use is for [[American football]].

It is the host of the annual [[Camellia Bowl (2014–present)|Camellia Bowl]] for the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]], and of Montgomery's five high school squads. It was home to the [[Blue–Gray Football Classic]], an all-star game usually played on Christmas Day, the [[Alabama State Hornets football]] team, and hosted the first ever football game played under the lights in the South.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montgomeryal.gov/index.aspx?page=188 City of Montgomery, website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721050054/http://www.montgomeryal.gov/index.aspx?page=188 |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPNNewCB&gt;{{cite news|last=McMurphy|first=Brett|title=Bowl created for MAC, Sun Belt|publisher=ESPN.com|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9581531/espn-creates-bowl-mac-sun-belt-teams|accessdate=August 20, 2013|date=August 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stadium history==
[[File:Cramton Bowl 1921.png|thumb|right|An architect's sketch of Cramton Bowl, 1921]]
Cramton Bowl is named for Fred J. Cramton, a local businessman who donated the land on which the stadium is built.&lt;ref&gt;"City Dads Accept Cramton Bowl Gift", ''Montgomery Advertiser'', February 9, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; After a conversation with friends about the need for a baseball stadium, Cramton donated his sanitary landfill to the city so a facility could be constructed there. The city held the land for a time and then returned it, stating that Cramton's stadium idea was too big of a project for the city to undertake. Cramton then decided to take matters into his own hands; with the help of the [[Junior Chamber of Commerce]], Cramton raised $33,000 to build the sports venue.&lt;ref name=Conversion&gt;{{cite web

===Capacity===
[[Seating capacity]] was expanded in 1929 to 7,991. More additions were made in 1946, increasing the seating capacity to 12,000.&lt;ref name=baseball/&gt; East stands were added in 1962 bringing the seating capacity up to 24,000. After new renovations were completed in July 2011 the capacity was reduced to 21,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alsportscapital.com/facility/cramton_bowl Central Alabama Sports Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811093838/http://alsportscapital.com/facility/cramton_bowl |date=2011-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseball==
[[File:Cramton Bowl baseball.jpg|thumb|Cramton Bowl during a baseball game in the 1920s or 1930s]]
The first baseball game played on the new field was in May 1922 between [[Auburn University]] and [[Vanderbilt University]].
Shortly after its completion in 1922 the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] decided to move their spring training operations from [[Eagle Pass, Texas]] to Montgomery. They used the facility for their 1923 and 1924 spring training and exhibition games before moving to a newer stadium in [[Fort Myers, Florida]].

After the departure of the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] spring training, [[Minor League Baseball]]'s newly formed [[Southeastern League]] placed a team in Montgomery. They became known as the [[Montgomery Lions]]. The Lions played in Cramton Bowl from 1927 to 1930. There was no team from 1931 to 1936 due to problems within the Southeastern League and the ongoing negative economic effects of the [[Great Depression]]. The team returned for the 1937 season as the [[Montgomery Bombers]] and garnered their first [[major league baseball]] affiliation with the [[Cleveland Indians]]. The Indians pulled out for the 1938 season and were replaced by the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. After one season the Phillies dropped their affiliation; the team became a co-op franchise and were renamed the [[Montgomery Rebels]]. In 1943, the Rebels would disband due to the manpower shortage caused by World War II. On July 11 of that year, the [[Chattanooga Lookouts]] moved their home games to Cramton Bowl to play out the rest of the season.&lt;ref name="Lookouts move from Chattanooga to Montgomery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2018/New%20York%20NY%20Sun/New%20York%20NY%20Sun%201943/New%20York%20NY%20Sun%201943%20-%200568.pdf|title=Senators shift Lookout franchise|last=The Old Scout|date=July 16, 1943|publisher=New York Sun|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lookouts managed to move back to Chattanooga and reverse the trend of declining attendance sometime later in the 1940s. The Rebels returned in 1946 through 1949 before moving to the newly constructed [[Paterson Field]] located just across the street.&lt;ref name=baseball&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/park.cgi?id=AL031 Baseball-Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalballparks.com/Southern/Cramton.html Digital Ballparks]&lt;/ref&gt;

The eighth and deciding game of the [[1943 Negro World Series]] was held at the Cramton Bowl, with the [[Homestead Grays]] defeating the [[Birmingham Black Barons]], 8-4.

==Football==
On September 23, 1927, Cramton Bowl became the site of the very first game played "under the lights" in the South with Cloverdale taking on Pike Road High School. Former superintendent D. H. "Sarge" Caraker remembers fondly, "[We] used dishpans for reflectors and sent to California for the lamps. We drew 7,200 people from all over the South to see it."&lt;ref name=Conversion/&gt;

===College football===
Cramton Bowl was host to all home games for [[Alabama State Hornets football]], and was the host to all of those for the [[Faulkner University]] Eagles. It was also home to the [[Turkey Day Classic]] and in 2009 hosted the inaugural [[HBCU]] [[All-star]] Bowl.

Cramton Bowl also provided a location for [[Alabama Crimson Tide football]] home games in the capital city. The Crimson Tide played home games at Cramton Bowl in the [[1922 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1922]] through [[1932 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1932 seasons]], in [[1934 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1934]], from [[1944 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1944]] through [[1946 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1946]] and again from [[1951 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1951]] through [[1954 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1954]]. Alabama's all-time record at Cramton Bowl was 17 wins and 3 losses.&lt;ref name="Results"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cramton Bowl probably achieved its greatest fame as the home of the [[Blue–Gray Football Classic]], an annual [[college football]] [[all-star]] game which was held there each December from 1938 until 2001.

Beginning in 2014, Cramton Bowl began hosting the [[Camellia Bowl (2014–present)|Camellia Bowl]], a college football [[bowl game]] which features teams from the [[Sun Belt Conference]] and [[Mid-American Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2013/8/19/4636402/montgomery-bowl-game-sun-belt-mac&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/08/19/newly-created-camellia-bowl-will-feature-mac-sun-belt-teams/&lt;/ref&gt;

===High school football===
Several area high schools call Cramton Bowl home including the [[Jefferson Davis High School (Montgomery, Alabama)|Jeff Davis Volunteers]], [[Sidney Lanier High School|Lanier Poets]], [[Robert E. Lee High School (Montgomery, Alabama)|Lee Generals]], Park Crossing High School Thunderbirds, and [[George Washington Carver High School (Montgomery, Alabama)|Carver Wolverines]]. In July 2011, Cramton Bowl hosted the [[Alabama High School Athletic Association]] Alabama All-Stars Sports Week football game.

==2011 renovations==
By the start of the 21st century, Cramton Bowl was widely regarded as being functionally obsolete for major sporting events. The stadium's relatively small capacity was not a concern as much as its age and condition. The stadium was not well maintained for most of its history, and by the dawn of the new millennium it was actually crumbling. These issues were factors, although not the predominant ones, in the Blue-Gray Game not being held in 2002 and its subsequent relocation in 2003 to [[Troy University]]'s [[Movie Gallery Stadium]], about 50 miles (80&amp;nbsp;km) from Montgomery.

In mid-2010 the City of Montgomery approved a measure for a $10 million renovation and addition to Cramton Bowl. The renovations planned for Cramton Bowl were a unique mix of the old and the new. The old structure was revamped and updated with four entrances, a state-of-the-art press box, an aesthetically enhanced plaza area, and a "Walk of Fame," which celebrates Montgomery's sports history and houses various articles of historic sports memorabilia. Perhaps the most important and impressive addition was the {{convert|90,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} multi-purpose sports facility.&lt;ref name=Conversion/&gt; Demolition of the north endzone and press box began in late November 2010, which was phase one of the project. Phase two began in early January 2011 as crews removed an existing brick wall from the south endzone and dismantled the scoreboard to make way for the new multi-purpose sports facility. Work on the stadium was completed in 2011 while the new multi-purpose facility was finished in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}'''Derby Greyhound Stadium''' or '''Derby Stadium''' was a [[greyhound racing]] venue in [[Derby]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=The Encyclopedia of Greyhound Racing|year=1981|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=07207-1106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
A full century before turning into a greyhound stadium the site was used as the county gaol and called the [[Derby Gaol|Vernon Street Prison]]. It was a six acre site on South Street backing onto Uttoxeter Old Road and cost £65,000 to build. The entrance was at the end of Vernon Street and the construction took six years to complete opening in 1827. The walls were 25 feet high enclosing three acres of land and the gaol held over 300 prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.old-maps.co.uk/#/Map/434264/336307/13/100155|title=OS Town Plan, Derby, Derbyshire 1883|publisher=old-maps.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It continued to serve as a prison until 1916 but was then used as a military prison. The buildings and cells inside the boundary walls were demolished in 1929 but the curtain wall and large entrance. Within five years the Preston Greyhound Racing Association had purchased the site and built a greyhound stadium within the walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tarter|first=P Howard|title=Greyhound Racing Encyclopedia|page =58|year=1949|publisher=Fleet Publishing Company Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opening==
The company who had just opened their [[Preston Greyhound Stadium|Preston]] track in May 1932 set an opening date of 29 April 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Derby Stadium Dog Racing|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000520/19330501/080/0007|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=Derby Evening Telegraph|date=1 May 1933|via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first manager was Ted Rimmer (one of the famous Rimmer brothers within the industry) and facilities included two clubs, one in the grandstand and one in the popular enclosure. The first ever winner was 2-1 shot Tramore Lad over 260 yards after defeating 6-4 favourite Santober by one length in 17.31. Many of the early races were just four dog events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|page =93|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumference of the track was 385 yards which was laid out on the former exercise yard for the prisoners, other distances were 460 and 650 yards.  The onsite kennels adjacent to the track backed onto Sims Avenue; the old prison officer's quarters were now houses for the trainers, a cookhouse, storage and staff rooms.

==History==
Trainer Charlie Green provided the track with their first major winner when Silver Wire won the 1939 [[Scurry Gold Cup]] at [[Clapton Stadium]]. Another track trainer Harold Broadbent looked after the greyhounds housed in the adjoining stadium kennels owned by the company and he would eventually become the head of the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]]. After the [[World War II|war]] a greyhound called Keepers Remorse raced a remarkable 409 times, finishing second 98 times and in 1947 the [[Tote board|tote]] turnover was £452,808.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Particulars of Licensed tracks, table 1 Licensed Dog Racecourses|year=1947|publisher=Licensing Authorities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racing Managers included Lieutenant-Colonel Prior and George Turnpenny who arrived from [[Willenhall Greyhound Stadium|Willenhall]] in the 1950s. The next milestone came in 1968 after the Pat Murphy trained Malaria won the Midland Flat Championship. During the sixties race nights were on Wednesday and Saturday evenings and facilities included three buffet bars and two licensed bars. The circuit circumference was re-measured at 378 yards. In the 1970s Barry Davis was Racing Manager and two principal events were introduced, they were the Derby Plate over 420 metres and the Derby Vase over 590 metres&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=The Encyclopedia of Greyhound Racing|pages =47–48|year=1981|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=07207-1106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==
In 1984 the ageing stadium was bought by Terry Corden for £300,000, Corden had taken over as General Manager in 1979. Peter Robinson was brought in as  Racing Manager and the only remaining trainers housed at the track kennels were Tom Harrison and Pat Murphy following the departure of Frank Heald and Peter Corbett. Corden sold the stadium for £1 million in 1988 to JF Miller properties and Heights of Abraham Limited. Within two years the Derby City Council received a planning application for redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=NGRC book of Greyhound Racing|page =63|year=1990|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=0-7207-1804-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last race meeting was held on Saturday 7 December 1988 (the same year as former sister track Preston).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Betts|first=Bob|title=The Sporting Life Greyhound Annual|page =86|year=1992|publisher=The Sporting Life|isbn=0-948955-22-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the area is very smart with office buildings contained within the redeveloped area. A beautifully restored entrance called Vernon Gate still marks the entrance of the prison and greyhound stadium.

'''Estadio El Teniente''', also known as '''Estadio El Teniente-Codelco''' for sponsorship reasons, is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Rancagua]], [[Chile]]. It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches. The stadium actually holds approximately 13,000 people and was built in 1945 with the name [[Braden Copper Company]] Stadium ''(Estadio Braden Copper Co.)''. The stadium is the home stadium for [[O'Higgins F.C.|O'Higgins]], the team of the city of [[Rancagua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/south_america/countries/chile.shtml|title=Stadiums in Chile|publisher=Worldstadiums.com|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium hosted seven matches of [[1962 FIFA World Cup]], where played matches of the group stage and quarter-finals.

In 2013, the stadium was renovated for hosting the [[2015 Copa América]], to be played in [[Chile]]. Two matches of the group stage will be played in this stadium.

==History==

===Construction===

[[File:Estadio Rancagua (Chile) - mayo de 1962.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The stadium in [[El Gráfico]] magazine in 1962.]]

The stadium, since its construction, was owned by the U.S. copper mining company [[Braden Copper Company]], which operated the mineral-extraction complex "El Teniente".

The designation of the Braden Copper Stadium to host matches in the [[1962 FIFA World Cup]] was due to an emergency. Indeed, the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake]] severely damaged or destroyed facilities in some of the originally-designated host cities of the FIFA World Cup in 1962 including [[Talca]], [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]], [[Talcahuano]] and [[Valdivia]], which caused the original schedule to be discarded and forced its almost complete modification. Further, [[Antofagasta]] and [[Valparaíso]] were deterred from fulfilling their offers to host because they could not feasibly construct self-funded stadiums, a condition that had been imposed by the Federation due to its own lack of resources. However, given the bleak outlook for the organization, the U.S. mining interests allowed the use of their stadium in [[Rancagua]].

[[File:Estadio El Teniente 2009.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The old stadium in a match against [[Cobreloa]].]]

===Nationalisation of copper===

The [[Government of Chile]] acquired in 1967 51% of the shares of Braden Copper Co., as part of the general [[nationalization]] of copper, which concluded in 1971. Therefore, the ownership and management of the "Estadio Braden Copper" passed to the state-owned coroporation [[Codelco|Codelco Chile]], which led to the name change to the current one.

===New stadium===

On May 21, 2008, the then-[[President of Chile|president]] [[Michelle Bachelet]] announced the "Red de Estadios para el [[Bicentennial of Chile|Bicentenario]]", a programme in which w new stadiums were built and upgrades planned for others, among which was the Estadio El Teniente. However, remodeling El Teniente was not executed during the term of Bachelet, although this was projected, due to the [[2010 Chilean earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elrancahuaso.cl/noticia/deporte/estadio-el-teniente-por-fin-se-cumplira-el-sueno-de-rancagua|title=Estadio El Teniente: Por fin se cumplirá el sueño de Rancagua|work=El Rancahuaso.cl, Noticias de Rancagua y O'Higgins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 2012, President [[Sebastian Piñera]] announced in Rancagua the final draft of the plans for remodelling the stadium, which will have a capacity of 15 000 spectators.

== Teams ==
This is a list of nicknames of professional and college football teams. Many are merely abbreviations or diminutives of the team's name; otherwise, the origin of the nickname (if known) is noted.  An [[asterisk]] [[asterisk|(*)]] after a nickname indicates that the name is pejorative, insulting, or has at least a negative intent, and is often used by opponents or detractors (including fans when the team is performing poorly).
Note on abbreviations: CFL – [[Canadian Football League]]; NFL – [[National Football League]]; NCAA – [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]

The '''Lithuania women's national volleyball team''' represents [[Lithuania]] in international women's [[volleyball]] competitions and friendly matches.

==History==
Although volleyball was always regularly played in Lithuania, both the country's men's and women's national teams were inactive for a long period. In 2013 the Lithuania women's national volleyball team participated in the [[2014 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship qualification (CEV)]] tournament, the first Lithuanian team international appearance after their extended absence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportas.lt/straipsnis/atgimusios-lietuvos-moteru-tinklinio-rinktines-trenere-d-simokaitiene-tai-yra-istorinis-ivykis-lietuvai-26099?menuRaised=1 Atgimusios Lietuvos moterų tinklinio rinktinės trenerė D.Simokaitienė: „Tai yra istorinis įvykis Lietuvai“]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lynah Rink''' (pronounced LIE-nuh) is a 4,267-seat hockey [[arena]] at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]], that opened in 1957. Named after [[James Lynah]], Class of 1905, who was the director of Cornell athletics from 1935 to 1943, it is home to the [[Cornell Big Red|Big Red]] men's and women's [[ice hockey]] teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Lynah has been home to hockey greats such as [[Ken Dryden]], [[Joe Nieuwendyk]], [[Matt Moulson]], [[Digit Murphy]], and [[Canada women's national ice hockey team|Olympic Gold Medalists]] [[Rebecca Johnston]] and [[Brianne Jenner]].

[[Image:Cornell'sawesomehockeyteam.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Lynah salute]]
The building is a [[quonset hut|quonset]] shaped structure covered with multi-colored (orange, tan, black, and brown) brick wall cladding set in a common bond pattern. Projecting from the facade of the structure is a one story rectangular wing flanked on either side by two vertical appendages, which have multi-paned colored glass windows. The one story wing has a strip of [[casement window]]s. The stairway is situated on the west side of the building. A white concrete block structure with wall buttresses connects Lynah Rink to Bartels Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Carpenter, Jr.]] whose gift came with the stipulation that he did not want his name on the building. The facility was designed by Van Storch, Evans, and Burkavage of [[Waverly, PA]] and constructed by Streeter Associates of [[Elmira, NY]].&lt;ref&gt;

The rink opened on March 21, 1957 with a match between the [[New York Rangers]] ([[NHL]]) and the [[Rochester Americans]] ([[American Hockey League|AHL]]) in front of 4200 spectators. It was subsequently dedicated on April 6, 1957 and named the [[James Lynah]] Skating Hall.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, 2006 Cornell University broke ground on a major renovation project designed to add {{convert|19500|sqft|m2}} to the rink. The additions and renovations included 464 new seats, upgraded locker rooms for both the men's and women's squads and their opponents, trainers' rooms, coaches' offices and a study area for players. A new scoreboard was added as well as preferred seating and a tunnel for the players.&lt;ref&gt;

==Lynah Faithful==
Fans of Cornell's Hockey program, aptly named the "Lynah Faithful," are among the loudest and most dedicated fans in the country, making Lynah Rink, many believe, one of college hockey's most hostile arenas. The raucous crowd support gives the Big Red one of the largest home ice advantages in college hockey, losing under 20% of their games on home ice since Lynah opened in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/espn/thelife/news/story?id=4796116&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lynah Faithful are cheered on by one cowbell, usually played by a zealous undergraduate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Many of the other regular chants of the Faithful are listed on a website, which serves as a useful primer in the history and traditions of Cornell Hockey when initiating new students into the Lynah Faithful.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elynah.com&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of all games at Lynah, when the opposing team leaves the ice, the Cornell team gathers at center ice and raises their sticks to salute the faithful as they applaud the team. This is known as the '''Lynah salute'''.
[[File:LynahCowbellPhoto.jpg|thumb|A zealous undergraduate student plays the cowbell. Chants are generally very loud, and students are known to lose their voices by the end of the match.]]

Cornell's men's team has had great success at Lynah Rink, closing in on its 500th win on home ice. Its record at Lynah was 15-0-1 during the 2004–05 season, 15-0-0 during the 2002–03 season, and 14-1-1 during the 2001–02 season. Postseason success at Lynah has been equally impressive. Since Lynah Rink hosted its first postseason game in 1966, Cornell's men's team has a postseason record of 38-7-2 in games played there. During the same period they were 14-1 in single elimination games with the sole loss coming against Providence in 1978 and 12-3 in multi-game series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Cornell has long been criticized for its policies regarding the distribution of season tickets to men's hockey home games.  Students often wait in line for nights to get tickets; however, some believe that this is part of the experience of being among Lynah Faithful. It's common to see students wearing [[T-shirt]]s proudly announcing, "I did my time in the line."  In 2005, despite efforts to improve the process over previous years, Cornell was [https://web.archive.org/web/20110607054511/http://www.cornellsun.com/node/15383 criticized] for creating chaos when the Athletic Department announced where students had to go for tickets.  In 2006, this was alleviated when the ticket line was preselected at random. During the 2009–10 Hockey season, students did not have to wait in line for season passes given growing concerns over swine flu. Instead the tickets were distributed via a lottery. Beginning in the fall of 2010, Cornell Athletics began distributing tickets via online ticket sales, giving priority to students who had previously purchased season tickets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cornellbigred.com/news/2010/9/12/MICE_0912100342.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Swanee River, cornell univ pep band, lynah rink.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Cornell [[Cornell Big Red Pep Band|Pep Band]] [[Sousaphone]]s play [[Old Folks at Home|Swanee River]] over an opposing team's bench to taunt them]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4082">There are 22 '''district Football Associations''' in [[Portugal]]. These organizations are the governing bodies (alongside the [[Portuguese Football Federation]]) of football in each [[Districts of Portugal|Portuguese district]]. 

==Overview==

Until the reform of Portuguese football in 1948, all clubs in a given district had to participate in the [[Portuguese District Championships|District Championship]], even those in [[Primeira Liga]] and [[Portuguese Second Division|Segunda Divisão]]; after 1948, a [[Portuguese Third Division|Terceira Divisão]] was established for transition between the [[Portuguese District Championships|District Championship]] and national leagues and the top level clubs no longer had to play in their [[Portuguese District Championships|District Championship]] (the arrangement did not include clubs from the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira Islands|Madeira]], which did not reach the top division until the 1970s).

With the reform of Portuguese Football League system in 2013, the [[Campeonato Nacional de Seniores]] became the Portuguese third-level [[association football|football]] league, making the principal [[Portuguese District Championships|District Championship]] the fourth-level leagues.

While the three districts in which the Azores were divided pre-autonomy were abolished, the district football associations haven't merged, and still exist as separate entities. Nevertheless, beginning in 2013, their clubs will compete in a unified Azores league before joining the [[Campeonato Nacional de Seniores]].

==List of district associations==

Sanderstead's [[Interwar]] growth coincided with electrification of the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] leaving largely a [[suburb]]an community of households having at least one commuter to central London or [[Croydon]].

== History ==
[[File:Sanderstead church.jpg|thumb|The Grade I listed All Saints' Church, Sanderstead]]
There is evidence of prehistoric human activity in and around Sanderstead.  In 1958–60 the Sanderstead Archaeological Group excavated in the vicinity of Sanderstead pond and revealed the presence of man as far back as the Mesolithic Period nearly 12,000 years ago, as well as pottery fragments dated between 100 AD and 1300 AD and a bronze belt from the end of the Saxon era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.croydon.gov.uk/leisure/parksandopenspaces/parksatoz/sandersteadpond/ssphistory |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112163500/http://www.croydon.gov.uk/leisure/parksandopenspaces/parksatoz/sandersteadpond/ssphistory |archivedate=12 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; North of the village at [[Croham Hurst]], upon a wooded hill, are circular barrows believed to be from a [[Bronze Age]] settlement.  This is now part of a public open space and the site is marked by a brass monument.  A [[Romano-British]] homestead (small farming settlement) was discovered during the construction of the Atwood School. During the 1980s, when the school was extended, further excavation revealed the remains of several round huts, hearths, a brooch, and pottery, some of which hailed from [[North Africa]].

An [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] reference to Sanderstead can be found in the will, dated 871, of  Alfred, an ealdorman.  The village lay within the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] administrative division of [[Wallington (hundred)|Wallington]] [[hundred (division)|hundred]]. It later appears to have been given to St Peter's Abbey, Winchester ([[Hyde Abbey]]) by Æthelflæd, the wife of [[Edgar the Peaceful]] and mother of [[Edward the Martyr]], where it remained after the [[Norman Conquest]].&lt;ref&gt;A topographical history of Surrey, by E.W. Brayley assisted by J. Britton ...  By Edward Wedlake Brayley, John Britton, page 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanderstead appears in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as ''Sandestede'', and belonging to St Peter's Abbey, Winchester. It had a noted population (probably of just the adult males) of 26 including 21 villagers, 4 slaves and 1 cottager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domesdaymap.co.uk/place/TQ3461/sanderstead/|title=Index of /place/TQ3461/sanderstead/|author=|date=|website=domesdaymap.co.uk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its Domesday assets were assessed as 5 [[hide (unit)|hide]]s, and 10 [[carucate]]s of arable land. It had 9 [[plough]]s and wood worth 30 [[hog (swine)|hog]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm Surrey Domesday Book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715015325/http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm |date=15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its Domesday entry records that in the time of [[Edward the Confessor]] it was valued at 100 shillings, and now 12 pounds; and yet it produces 15 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;A topographical history of Surrey, by E.W. Brayley assisted by J. Britton ...  By Edward Wedlake Brayley, John Britton, Page 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The village was granted to [[Sir John Gresham]] by [[Henry VIII]] following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. It was passed to his son Richard who subsequently sold it to John Ownsted, the transfer being ratified in 1591. Ownsted died without issue in 1600, and devised his estates to his two sisters and cousin Harman Atwood, with Atwood subsequently purchasing the shares of his joint legatees. The Atwood family had a long association with Sanderstead, with inscriptions at the local church indicating a presence in the village from the reign of [[Edward II]].&lt;ref&gt;A topographical history of Surrey, by E.W. Brayley assisted by J. Britton ...  By Edward Wedlake Brayley, John Britton, Page 41&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, 6 September 1731, the nearby Sanderstead Common was the venue for an [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important cricket match]] between [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] and [[Thomas Chambers' XI cricket team|Thomas Chambers' XI]], Surrey winning the match by an unknown margin.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; On Monday, 26 June 1732, Surrey played [[London Cricket Club|London]] on the common. This match was drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[manor house]], known as [[Sanderstead Court]], was substantially remodelled by Harman Atwood.  This large country house was probably first constructed in the early sixteenth century. The Atwoods continued to occupy the house until 1778, when it was devised to Atwood Wigsell.  It was turned into a hotel in 1928, and before the [[Second World War]] it was used by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). It was very badly damaged by fire (not a bomb) in 1944 and was demolished in 1958. One very small part of the hotel building does however still stand. On the site now stands "Sanderstead Court", a three-storey block of flats.

One of the more curious aspects of Sanderstead is that it has no pub, unlike nearby [[Warlingham]] which has around six. 

On the edge of the village lies the site of the Old Saw Mill now home to a number of private residences and the picturesque setting for Sanderstead Cricket Club. Cricket has been played here since 1883 and continues to the present day with four teams playing in the Surrey Championship and a number of other Colts and friendly teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanderstead.play-cricket.com/website/web_pages/80378|title=Sanderstead CC|author=|date=|website=sanderstead.play-cricket.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located between Limpsfield Road and Kingswood Lane is the large ''Kings Wood''.
It derives its name from a small wood to the north of Kings Wood Lodge. In 1823, Ordnance Survey Maps called the wood Sanderstead Wood, but this might be due to a mistake.
It covers some 147½ acres, criss-crossed by ancient rides and is on relatively flat ground.  It was purchased in 1937 under the Green Belt Act by the local council and is now public open space. There is the site of a Romano-British settlement on the northern boundary, a small farmstead undisturbed for 2000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croydononline.org/history/places/parks_and_open_spaces/kingswood.asp|title=Online communities|author=|date=22 January 2016|website=croydononline.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Sanderstead has four schools, namely; Atwood Primary School, Gresham Primary School, Kingsdown Secondary School and Ridgeway Primary School. It is also conveniently placed for a number of others located within a couple of miles from the village including [[Croydon High School]], [[Harris Academy Purley]], [[Riddlesdown Collegiate]], [[Royal Russell School]], [[The Quest Academy, Croydon|The Quest Academy]], [[Thomas More Catholic School, Purley|Thomas More Catholic School]], [[Warlingham School]], and [[Whitgift School]].

==Demography==
The 2011 census showed that White British was the largest ethnic group in Sanderstead ward, forming 76% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/sanderstead-e05000160|title=Sanderstead - UK Census Data 2011|first=Good Stuff IT|last=Services|date=|website=UK Census Data|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Sanderstead has consistently returned [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] MPs to the local seat of [[Croydon South (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon South]] and has also returned Conservative members to the local council. Since the north of Croydon tends to return [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] councillors, a near-identical split in representation follows. The current MP for Croydon South is [[Chris Philp]].

Sanderstead is one of the twenty-four [[ward (country subdivision)|ward]]s constituting [[Croydon London Borough Council]]. Three councillors are elected every four years to represent the ward on the Council. The current elected Councillors are:

The '''Sargodha Cricket Stadium''' is a cricket [[stadium]] located in [[Sargodha]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]] . It is within walking distance of the [[University of Sargodha]] (UOS) and part of the Local Sports and Entertainment Precinct.

The Stadium was firstly used in 1954. It only hosted on Jan 10, 1992.

Internationally, Sargodha Stadium is remembered as the first match of series 1991-92 between Pakistan and Sri Lanka was played in this stadium. Pakistan won this match easily by securing victory by 8 wickets. That was the first international match it has hosted and the last one so far. The open-air stadium is also famous for its role in the development of local cricket. Many youngsters attend practice sessions in the stadium. Many local events like sports functions by local universities, colleges and schools.

The Sargodha Stadium, also known as Sports Stadium, Sargodha, has hosted other events, including a picket by PTI's Chairman and former cricketer Imran Khan and by some other famous leaders too, and also hosts major musical concerts.

This page discusses '''scoring''' in the [[Gaelic games]] of [[hurling]], [[Gaelic football]], [[camogie]], [[ladies' Gaelic football]], [[international rules football]] and [[shinty-hurling]]. 

Note that although [[rounders]] and [[Gaelic handball]] are considered "Gaelic games", they are not listed under this page.

==Scoring==
In [[hurling]], [[Gaelic football]], [[camogie]], [[ladies' Gaelic football]] and [[shinty-hurling]], the goalposts are placed {{Convert|6.5|m|abbr=on}} apart and are at least {{Convert|7|m|abbr=on}} tall,&lt;ref&gt;http://ww.w.thesmartjournal.com/GAA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with a crossbar at a height of {{Convert|2.5|m|abbr=on}}. Playing the ball (a [[sliotar]] or [[Ball (Gaelic football)|Gaelic football]], depending on the game) between the posts and below the crossbar scores a '''goal''' ({{Lang-ga|cúl}}), while playing the ball between the posts and above the crossbar scores a '''point''' (''cúilín''). A goal is worth 3 points. The [[umpire]] signifies a goal by waving a green flag, and a point by waving a white flag. These flags have been used since the 1900s; one game in the [[United States]] in 1907 used a US flag to signify points, and an Irish flag (presumably the [[Irish tricolour|tricolour]]) for a goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=U3K3DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=%22green+flag%22+%22white+flag%22+first+used+gaa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ_LCppMXeAhWsAMAKHWVeDAEQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=flag&amp;f=false|title=On the Cross Road of Polity, Political Elites and Mobilization|first1=Barbara|last1=Wejnert|first2=Paolo|last2=Parigi|date=21 December 2016|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:International Rules Football scores.png|thumb|400px|Scoring in [[international rules football]].]]
In [[international rules football]] there are further posts {{Convert|6.5|m|abbr=on}} either side of the goalposts. Playing the ball between the goalposts and these side posts scores a '''behind'''. Playing the ball between the centre posts and below the crossbar scores a '''goal''', while playing the ball between the posts and above the crossbar scores an '''over'''. A goal is worth 6 points, an over 3, and a behind 1.

===Terminology===

The Irish term for goal is ''cúl'', [[cognate]] with [[Latin]] [[wikt:culus|''cūlus'']], "rear." "Point" is ''cúilín'', a [[diminutive]] form.

==History==

===First GAA rules===
The first [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] rules were published by the fledgling [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] in 1885. These specified goalposts similar to [[soccer]] goals: for football {{Convert|15|ft|abbr=on}} wide and a crossbar {{Convert|8|ft|abbr=on}} high, while for hurling they were {{Convert|20|ft|abbr=on}} wide and a crossbar {{Convert|10|ft|abbr=on}} high. Goals were the only score possible; this led to a high number of drawn games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:tOlW8_iW0gMJ:https://www.nli.ie/GetAttachment.aspx?id=4833289f-fd82-4978-9471-eceff459cb06+&amp;cd=36&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ie|title=LEAVING CERTIFICATE HISTORY CASE STUDY|website=webcache.googleusercontent.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886 two poles were placed {{Convert|21|ft|abbr=on}} either side of the goals.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.museum.ie/The-Collections/Documentation-Discoveries/July-2015/Gaelic-Athletic-Association-Football-Rules-Book,-1&lt;/ref&gt; A goal was scored when the ball was played into the goal; a point was scored when the ball was played above the crossbar, or wide of the goals between the two outer posts. When the ball was played wide of the outer posts, no score was recorded, unless it was played by a defernder, in which case a ''forfeit point'' was awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://irishamerica.com/2017/02/up-tipp-hurling-nationalism/|title=Up Tipp: Hurling &amp; Nationalism|date=1 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://crokepark.ie/BlankSite/media/Images/secondary-schools-resource-pack.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Whichever team scored most goals won the game; if teams were tied on goals, points were counted, and forfeit points were worth {{fraction|5}} of a point. Forfeit points thus rarely made any difference, although one game in 1887  ended North Tipperary 0-0 (1), Holycross 0-0 (0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=D4pZDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT140&amp;lpg=PT140&amp;dq=%22forfeit+point%22+hurling&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=22xZ7yHfAq&amp;sig=TtXA-qGJp6EBu_T2-oe-wjcSEVQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiU3NGcl8PeAhWSbsAKHexIAuYQ6AEwB3oECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22forfeit+point%22&amp;f=false|title=The Hurlers: The First All-Ireland Championship and the Making of Modern Hurling|first=Paul|last=Rouse|date=6 September 2018|publisher=Penguin UK|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The score was written in the format ''goals''–''points'' (''forfeit points''), e.g. Tipperary's score of 1-1 (1) in the [[1887 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final]]

In 1888 the forfeit point was abolished, replaced by a {{Convert|70|yd|abbr=on}} puck in hurling and a {{Convert|50|yd|abbr=on}} kick in football. Hurling and Gaelic football goals were made the same size: {{Convert|21|ft|abbr=on}} by {{Convert|8|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=UtQJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=GAA+goalposts+%22feet+apart%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sCnvbDUZe1&amp;sig=Y5tfwXo_C0qyO7KY-Sk2aE7aGc4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjWyezGncPeAhVkIcAKHXT2DboQ6AEwGXoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=GAA+goalposts+%22feet+apart%22&amp;f=false|title=The reliable book of outdoor games|first=H.|last=Chadwick|date=7 November 1893|publisher=Рипол Классик|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892 the goal was changed to be worth five points. 

In 1896 the goal was reduced to three points, and has held that value ever since.

In 1910 the side posts were removed, and the H-shaped goalposts introduced. Now, a point had to go over the crossbar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2018/0713/978456-the-7-ages-of-hurling/|title=The Game - 7 Ages of Hurling|first=Mikey|last=Stafford|date=15 July 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern experiments===
In the [[2005 National Hurling League]] two points were awarded for a point scored from a sideline cut in hurling, in recognition of the difficulty of this skill (typically only about one-fifth of such efforts are successful).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/ladies-sticking-with-skirts-as-oflynn-backs-rules-makeover-26837681.html|title=Ladies sticking with skirts as O'Flynn backs rules makeover - Independent.ie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/hurling/cutting-edge-line-art-still-a-major-draw-36785192.html|title=Cutting edge: Line art still a major draw - Independent.ie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of increasing the value of the goal to 4 points has come up repeatedly in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.balls.ie/gaa/almost-every-known-solution-improve-gaa-past-20-years-233953|title=Every Known Solution To Improve The GAA In The Past 20 Years|first=Conor|last=Neville|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/the-gaa/games/hurling-review-committee|title=Hurling Review Committee|website=www.gaa.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Frequency==

An oft-repeated aphorism, especially with regard to Gaelic football, is "points win games" or "take your points and the goals will come."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaacork.ie/taggedNews/47537/cork_football_teams_v_clare|title=Cork GAA Official Website|website=gaacork.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/gaa/hurling/take-the-points-and-the-goals-334970.html|title=Take the points and the goals...|date=6 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has become especially true in recent decades: in the mid-1970s, games in the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] averaged 3.5 goals, but in the 2000s this had fallen to 1 goal per game. [[Martin Breheny]] observed "Improved fitness levels, more mobile defenders, and better defensive techniques have combined to seal off attackers' approach routes, making the goal an endangered species." Raising the value to 4 or even 5 points has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/time-for-the-gaa-to-reassess-its-football-goals-26084096.html|title=Time for the GAA to re-assess its football goals - Independent.ie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In hurling, goals per game has decreased from a peak of 4.18 per game in 1983, in part because of a rule change that banned handpassed goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2018/0806/983440-the-art-of-the-assassin-the-lust-for-green-flags/|title=The art of the 'assassin' &amp; the lust for green flags|first=Christy|last=O'Connor|date=6 August 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hurlingfacts.wordpress.com/2011/07/06/is-point-scoring-really-increasing-in-championship-hurling/|title=Is point scoring really increasing in Championship Hurling?|date=6 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==

A particular notation has been developed over the years by journalists and statisticians to record scoring in Gaelic games.

===Score by team===

A team's score is given in the form ''goals-points'', separated by either a [[hyphen]] ( - ) or [[en dash]] ( – ), for example ''Kerry 2-10 Cork 1-12''. The total points score may be given in brackets afterward for clarity: ''Kerry 2-10 (16) Cork 1-12 (15)''. Unlike other sports, where the home team's name is given before the away team, in Gaelic games the winning team's name is almost always given first.

Scores are spoken aloud thus:
*0-20: "twenty points"
*1-6: "one six"
*3-17: "three seventeen"
*2-0: "two goals"
*0-0: "no score"

In [[international rules football]], the score is given in the format ''goals.overs.points (total)'', for example the [[2014 International Rules Series]] ended [[Australia international rules football team|Australia]] 0.17.5 (56), [[Ireland international rules football team|Ireland]] 2.9.7 (46).

===Score by player===

In newspaper and other written accounts of games, the score of each individual player is given in abbreviated format. First the total is given, and then it is broken down by [[dead ball]] scores.
*'''f''' or '''fs''': free kicks / free pucks
*'''pen''': penalty kicks / penalty pucks
*'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;45&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' or '''&lt;nowiki&gt;‘&lt;/nowiki&gt;45''': 45-metre kick (awarded in [[Gaelic football]] and [[ladies Gaelic football]] when a defender plays the ball over his/her own end line, like a [[corner kick]] in soccer); a 45-metre puck is awarded in [[camogie]]
*'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;65&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' or '''&lt;nowiki&gt;‘&lt;/nowiki&gt;65''': 65-metre puck (awarded in [[hurling]] when a defender plays the ball over his own end line)
*'''s/l''' or '''sl''': sideline kicks / sideline pucks
* Scores from open play are not indicated; any scores not accounted for by dead ball are from open play by default.

So if a report says ''James Kelly 2-5 (1-1f, 1-0pen, 0-2 '45')'', it means that he scored 2 goals and 5 points, of which a goal and a point were from frees, a goal from a penalty, two points from 45-metre kicks, and the other two points were from open play. If no goals are scored, the ''0-'' will be omitted, e.g. ''Michael O'Shea 0-9 (5f, 1 '65', 1 s/l)''. If all scores were of one type, the brackets may be omitted, reading: ''Síle Harrington 0-5f'' (indicating five points, all of which were frees) or ''J. J. Maguire 1-0pen'' (one goal, a penalty) or sometimes ''Sarah Moore 0-4(fs)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoganstand.com/Type/football/Article/Index/280780|title=FL2: Rossies rally stuns Premier - HoganStand|website=www.hoganstand.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Skimboarding Seal Beach 11 25 11.webm|thumb|Ski at [[Seal Beach, California|Seal Beach]], 2011]]
'''Skimboarding''' (or '''skimming''') is a [[boardsport]] in which a ''skimboard'' (much like a [[surfboard]] but smaller and without fins) is used to glide across the water's surface to meet an incoming [[breaking wave]], and ride it back to shore. Wave-riding skimboarders perform a variety of surface and air maneuvers, at various stages of their ride, out to, and back with, the wave. Some of these are known as "wraps," "big spins," "360 shove-its" and "180s." Unlike surfing, skimboarding begins on the [[beach]] by dropping the board onto the thin wash of previous waves. Skimboarders use their [[momentum]] to skim out to breaking waves, which they then catch back into shore in a manner similar to surfing. [[File:Bigspin at Kiahuna Beach.jpg|thumb|200px|Skimboarder|Poipu Beach Kauai,Hawaii]] Another aspect of skimboarding is "flatland," which involves performing tricks derived from skateboarding such as [[Ollie (skateboarding trick)|ollies]] and [[shove-it]]s on the wash of waves without catching [[Surf break|shore break]]s.  Skimboarding originated in [[Southern California]] when [[Laguna Beach, California|Laguna Beach]] [[lifeguard]]s wanted to surf the local [[Surf break|shore breaks]] that were too fast and shallow for surfboards.  Skimboarding has developed since then to ride waves much like surfing, performing [[aerial maneuvers]] and pulling into the barrel of the wave. Professionals have even started getting towed by [[WaveRunner|waverunners]] into much larger waves. Professional Skimboarder, [http://exileskimboards.com/team/brad-domke/ Brad Domke], displayed the new technique in this video.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ExileSkimboards|title=The Biggest Wave Ever Ridden On A Skimboard - Brad Domke - Exile Skimboards|date=2014-07-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cu0VnsWNTI|accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skimboard characteristics==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
[[File:Surfwax.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Man applying [[surfboard wax]] to a skimboard.]]
Riders typically favor a board [[length]] which reaches about their mid-[[chest]] height when stood on end.

Thickness of the board depends somewhat on the [[materials]] used in construction, but typically ranges from 3/8&amp;nbsp;inch to 1&amp;nbsp;inch.  The most common thicknesses are 5/8" and 3/4".  A few high-flotation [[foam]] core boards and "soft" boards have been built with thicknesses in excess of 2&amp;nbsp;inches. A 5/8 board is capable of sharper turns while sacrificing a little speed. A 3/4 will be able to glide out farther, but turns slightly slower.

Most skimboards will have some nose lift, or rocker. There are three types of rockers generally used for skimboards. There is a constant rocker, which means that the board has a constant curve from nose to tail. Constant rockers are known for better control on bigger waves and steeper slopes.  Another type of rocker and the most commonly used is a hybrid rocker. This means that the board has a curve on the bottom through about 3/4 of the board's length, the rest (meaning the flat part) is usually the tail. This type of rocker is good for both speed and control on decent size waves; also the best type of board for flatland tricks. Last of all, a traditional rocker means that the board is almost completely flat except for the nose. A traditional rocker is typically used for east coast conditions where the waves are far out.

==Dangers==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
There are many types of [[risk|dangers]] that skimboarders can face on a daily basis.  It is not uncommon to see [[bone fracture|fractures]] or [[joint dislocation|dislocations]] of the lower limbs, some requiring serious [[Health care (disambiguation)|medical attention]]. [[Lacerations]], [[Sprained ankle|twisted ankles]] and [[bruises]] are also common, due to impacts with the board itself, or [[rocks]], logs and other obstacles present on beaches. [[Hamstring]] injury is also common due to the fast and extreme movement of a skimboarder's legs when they run toward the water and jump on the board. [[Drowning]] amongst skimboarders is not as likely as amongst surfers due to the shallow water in which skimboarding is usually practiced. Also, due to the shallow water, [[cervical fracture]] is a very dangerous possibility when riding big waves.

A study was done in a British journal on the dangers of skimboarding, and it states, "Over a 5 month period—May to September 2003, 10 patients were seen by the fracture team at the [[Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust]]. Of the 10, eight were male, with an average age 18.7 (range 12–31). There was an equal incidence of left and right sided injuries. All the injuries were closed with no neurovascular [[symptoms]] or signs. Eight were to the lower limb, all of which were fractures of the [[distal tibia]], [[ankle]], and mid-foot. Six patients required hospital admission. . . [all of these injuries were from skimboarding]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dangers of skimboarding|author=|date=1 November 2006|publisher=|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=40|issue=11|pages=905|pmc=2465017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many injuries that skimboarders suffer happen over a long period of time. Such injuries include: groin strain, fractures, leg pains, [[shin splints]], etc. Some of these injuries can be prevented by [[stretching]] before and after a session.

Another foot injury that can occur is "skimboard toe". Much like "[[turf toe]]," it develops from overuse and can eventually break bones in your foot.

Other dangers to consider while skimboarding are [[riptide]]s. They can be very strong in certain areas and bring a skimboarder out to [[sea]] very quickly. There have been a few incidences of skimboarders dying from drowning by being caught in a riptide.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Many skimboarders{{who|date=August 2013}} recommend asking locals about [[tides]] and swells as well as checking tide charts if skimming in a new area. Doing so will also help avoid rocks that are hidden under waves, which are another potential cause of serious injury.

==Locations==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
Many consider the center of skimboarding to be located in Laguna Beach, California where skimboarding became popular in the late 1920s when lifeguards would skim across [[sand]] on pieces of wood. Every [[summer]], Victoria Skimboards sponsors a contest called the VIC, which is held at Aliso Beach in Laguna; it is one of the biggest skimboarding competitions in the [[world]]. Other Laguna hot spots consist of Tenth street, West Street, Treasure Island, Thalia Street, and Crescent Bay. In [[Dewey Beach, Delaware]], every year the World Amateur Championships of Skimboarding are held on New Orleans Street. The Florida Pro/Am is held every year in August, on [[Vilano Beach, Florida]], which is known as the best [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] skimboarding location.  Big skimboarding waves are also found in [[Cabo San Lucas, Mexico]]. However, people skim in many other locations throughout [[North America]], [[Europe]] (the main locations being [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[british isles|United Kingdom]] &amp; the [[Netherlands]]), [[Australia]], [[Asia]], and [[South America]]. Some people skim [[Inland navigation|inland]] because of difficulty with shore access. Flatland skimboarding can be done nearly anywhere: [[lakes]], [[rivers]], [[Stream|creeks]], [[ponds]], [[golf courses]], [[puddles]], or even wet [[grass]]. In the [[United States]], flatland skim scenes have developed primarily in states not bordering the ocean. Flatland has also developed in British Columbia, [[Ontario]], and along The [[Great Lakes]].

Australia (Melbourne and [[Parramatta]]), and [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]] also have dedicated flatland communities and riders. In Europe, the Flatland skim scene is growing fast, with the biggest group of skimboarders situated in [[Poland]]. Skimboarding is popular on many beaches where it is impossible to surf, for example, on [[Boa Viagem, Recife]], Brazil, where surfing is banned due to the threat of shark attacks. Beaches that have streams or rivers flowing into the ocean can also make ideal downhill skimming areas.

'''Wave Riding Skimboards'''

Wave riding is the style most popular and best recognized in the sport of skimboarding. There are more athletes and competitions in wave riding than any other division of skimboarding. It is also the hardest and most technical. Today's wave riding boards are a product of years of trials and errors. There isn't much variation in shape because of this. There is a wide variety of beginner to very advanced, high performance boards in this category and it is important to choose the right one for your size, ability and style.
Wave riding skimboarders refer to their board as a "skimboard."  However to inland skimborders it is referred to as a "foamie."

The majority of wave riding skimboard manufacturers use a closed cell foam, which is a high density foam material that resists water absorption and dings.  A [[Fiber-reinforced polymer]] is commonly used to cover the foam forming a strong outer shell.

[[Fiberglass]] boards are great, compared to the wooden board. They are faster, lighter, and they have more control on the water. The fiberglass behaves across the sand and water better, which is important for doing tricks and moves with the skimboard when it hit the wave. Its outer shell is strong, but easy to dent with rocks, shells, like any other composite skimboard.

[[Carbon fiber]] boards are lighter, stronger, and stiffer than the fiberglass skimboards and faster on the water and on the wet sand but they are one of the most expensive boards. These boards are more commonly used by professional riders that ride big waves.

There are four essential characteristics specific for riding a variety of waves.  The board must be light enough to practically float (skim) on the water, but heavy enough that it will not fly away in the wind.  It must be fast, as skimboarders need speed to get to the desired wave and not miss it completely.  It must have adequate and appropriate rocker for your desired skimboarding location.  It must be flexible according to personal preference based on riding style and ability.

'''Flatland or Inland Skimboards'''

Inland boards are generally made of wood and are easy to find at a local surf or skate shop, depending on your location. Inland boards tend to be made of wood and have a hpl bottom{{clarify|date=May 2016}} and, therefore, are called "woodies" by wave-riding skimboarders. Wood core can boards are quite rugged. They are meant for grinding rails and doing tricks.  They stand up well against rocks and shells, obstacles, and general wear, they are great for beginners because they are simple to make and low-price. They are also used by a lot of professional skimboarders and can learn how to do a lot more tricks such as a "Bigger Spin".

There are two basic sides of the spectrum for board types. The “Trick board,” a board where both sides are symmetrical and the shape is even throughout. This makes it ideal for spinning the board and completing tricks due to its symmetry. The “Cruiser board,” a board where the shape follows the same curves as a surfboard and is either slightly pointed or rounded at the top or tip and the back is slightly rounder. The backside of the board can also have a tail. These boards are typically called pintails.

==Industry==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
The increasing international interest in skimboarding has resulted in the development of a competitive industry, catering for the ever-increasing demand for both quality and cheap skimboards. Each company has what they call [[team riders]]. Some famous riders are: Paulo Prietto, a professional skimboarder from California, and Brad Domke, a new rider from Florida which just beat the world record of the biggest wave ridden before, people who skimboard in competitions while representing their company [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] to promote their boards. They usually have an amateur and professional team who are supplied by the manufacturer with skimboards at no or little cost. However, as a pro-rider the company usually pays for all traveling expenses for their riders on competition tours.

==Contests==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
Skimboarding contests are held to establish ranking amongst skimboarders and provide a way for companies to market products. In North America there are two centralized organizations that hold events: United Skim Tour and Skim USA. There are also a lot of minor competitions such as the Virgin River Classic held in St. George Utah.  In recent years the United Skim Tour (UST) has focused solely on professional competition while Skim USA has gravitated towards amateur competition.  Some events are both Skim USA and UST events, and all Skim USA competitions have a professional division.

In Europe, the European Skimboard League was created in 2009 to promote skimboarding across the world. Its creation has been seen as one of the finest moments in European skimboarding to date. The 2009 League was won by Emanuel (Mega) Embaixador and in 2010 Hugo Santos. The league consists of 4 stages mostly held in the summer months, although UK &amp; Spanish events tend to happen just outside the holiday season. The stages are held in Portugal, France, The UK &amp; Spain, each hosted at one of the best skimboarding locations found anywhere in the world. The UK event is held at Tolcarne Beach in Newquay, Cornwall. Newquay is a location famous for its surfing scene and Tolcarne Beach is known as the UK Wedge to many surfers, bodyboarders &amp; skimboarders.

The DB Dash point Open is a flatland contest that takes place in Federal Way Washington, U.S.A at Dash Point State Park once a year&lt;nowiki/&gt;https://dbskimboards.com/articles/2016-db-pro-skimboard-contest. The Dash Point Pro/Am contest has been running for thirteen years&lt;nowiki/&gt;https://dbskimboards.com/articles/10th-annual-dash-point-proam. The first contest happened in 2003 and the latest in 2016 where Cody Maurer of Utah won first place in the Pro division&lt;nowiki/&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F8HcymKw3I. Maurer landed a flawless backside 270 big-spin to front board on a launch ramp to double flat bar set-up. This banger helped him win first place.

In the past The Victoria World Championships determined the World Champion of Professional Skimboarding.  The United Skim Tour moved professional skimboarding to a points system in 2012. Most events consist of a set time and date, but, there has been a small movement to start holding waiting period competitions like the Florida Pro/Am held in Vilano Beach, Florida each year, also the DB Pro-AM at Dash Point State Park. The pros all look forward to the first official contest of the year, which until 2013 was held in Cabo San Lucas every spring, but is now held in Brazil.  In 2013, Cabo San Lucas was moved to the second contest of the year.  The Florida Pro/Am is a skimboarding tournament held each August, on Vilano Beach, Florida.  It typically lasts three days, and is the final leg of The Florida Cross Over Tour which includes surfing, skateboarding and skimboarding. The Florida Pro/Am and The Florida Cross-Over Tour are both considered premier skimboarding events. Some well-known skimboarders are Austin Keen, who is the current 2013 UST World Champion, Bill Bryan, Brad Domke, Adrien Raza, Morgan Just, Grady Archbold, James Lovett, Sam Stinnett, Paulo Prietto, Brandon Sears, Brandon Rothe, Jackson Tenney, and Colton Wallace.

Three leading companies are Exile Skimboards, Victoria Skimboards and Zap Skimboards.  There are two types of contests; flatland and wave riding contests.

[[Image:Monaco005.jpg|thumb|A top view of the stadium]]
The '''Stade Louis II''' ({{IPA-fr|stad(ə) lwi dø}}) is a [[stadium]] located in the [[Fontvieille, Monaco|Fontvieille]] district of [[Monaco]]. It serves primarily as a venue for [[Association football|football]], being the home of [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]] and the [[Monaco national football team]]. From 1998 to 2012, the stadium hosted the annual [[European Super Cup|UEFA Super Cup]] match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefasupercup/news/newsid=1644318.html|title=Prague celebrates 2013 Super Cup honour|date=17 June 2011|work=UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium is also used for the [[Herculis]], a [[track and field]] meet of the [[IAAF Diamond League]].  From 2003 to 2005 it hosted the [[IAAF World Athletics Final]], though certain events, such as the [[hammer throw|hammer]], had to be held elsewhere, due to the stadium's relatively small capacity.

The original [[Stade Louis II (1939)|Stade Louis II]] was opened in 1939 as the home of [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]]. The new stadium was built in the early 1980s, close to the site of the old stadium on land reclaimed from the sea, opening fully in 1985. {{As of|2016}} the capacity was about 18,500 all seated, about half of the population of Monaco (about 36,371), and more than any other stadium in the country.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The vast majority of the stadium's facilities are located underground, with a large car park directly under the pitch (something that has caused some degree of criticism from managers of AS Monaco's opponents in the past over the state of the pitch).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The stadium is named after [[Louis II, Prince of Monaco]], who was the [[Prince#Nominal principalities|Sovereign Prince]] of Monaco when the original stadium was built.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Events==
On 29 July 2008, [[Yelena Isinbayeva]] set the women's pole vault world record of 5.04 metres at the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IAAF Statistics Handbook, 2009 |url=http://www.iaaf.org/mm/document/competitions/competition/05/15/63/20090706014834_httppostedfile_p345-688_11303.pdf |publisher=[[IAAF]] |accessdate=4 April 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629134819/http://www.iaaf.org/mm/document/competitions/competition/05/15/63/20090706014834_httppostedfile_p345-688_11303.pdf |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2011, [[The Eagles]] played at the ground at the [[Wedding of Albert II, Prince of Monaco, and Charlene Wittstock|wedding of Prince Albert II to Charlene Wittstock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mariage princier : concert au stade Louis II (Princely marriage - concert at the Stade Louis II)|url=http://www.noblesseetroyautes.com/2011/07/mariage-princier-concert-au-stade-louis-ii/|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=Noblesse et Royautés|date=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explosion==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
On 31 May 2004, an explosion, apparently deliberate, caused damage to the Stade Louis II and a neighbouring building, [[La Ruche, Fontvieille]]. No injuries were reported and responsibility for the attack remained unclear. The damage, while relatively extensive to portions of the fabric of the buildings, was verified as not having affected the buildings' respective structures. The Government of Monaco assumed responsibility for repairs to the damage caused by the explosion, without preempting the results of expert investigations, which continued. This explosion constituted a rare exception to the principality's long-established reputation for safety and absence of violence.

==Facilities==
[[Image:Salle Gaston Médecin.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The [[Salle Gaston Médecin]] indoor arena, which is used by the [[AS Monaco Basket|AS Monaco]] basketball club]]
The [[Salle Gaston Médecin]] indoor arena is located under the stands of the football stadium. Salle Gaston Médecin is able to host [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], and [[handball]] games, as well as [[judo]] and [[fencing]] matches, and [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] and [[gymnastics]] competitions.

Stade Louis II, containing a large office complex, also houses the [[International University of Monaco]] (IUM), which specializes in business education.

The '''Syracuse Mile''' was a {{convert|1|mile|km|adj=on}} [[Dirt track racing|dirt]] [[Oval racing|oval]] [[Stock car racing|raceway]]  located at the [[Great New York State Fair|New York State Fairgrounds]] in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Originally built for [[harness racing]] in 1826, the first auto race was run in 1903, making it the second oldest auto racing facility in United States history. The track and grandstands were torn down in 2016 by state government officials with the plan to modernize facilities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The history of the Moody Mile| url=https://360nitro.tv/articles/2014/10/01/the-history-of-the-moody-mile |publisher=360nitro.tv|accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harness racing==

The Syracuse Mile hosted [[harness racing]] from its opening until 2005.  The [[Hambletonian Stakes]] were held from 1926 through 1929. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Early Years| url=https://www.hambletonian.com/hambletonian-history.html |publisher=The Hambletonian Society, Inc|accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the early 1970s, a new 16,000-seat grandstand was built as part of an unsuccessful attempt to bring back the Hambletonian Stakes. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/36634141/  The Post-Standard (1976, February 23, p.15)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auto racing==

In 1900, a $10,000 bid was awarded to build a dirt track suitable for auto racing on the perimeter of the harness track. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Place of 'mystery, lore and legend'| url=http://www.syracuse.com/kirst/index.ssf/2015/09/place_of_mystery_lore_and_legend_in_farewell_to_moody_mile_where_is_deep_respect.html |publisher=Syracuse.com|accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
The first auto race at the track was held in 1903, and won by [[Barney Oldfield]] in his "Baby Bullet".  Oldfield averaged more than 60 mph in a lap around the mile.  Syracuse was one of the several tracks one mile in length that made up the [[American Automobile Association|AAA]] [[AAA Contest Board|national championship]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Farewell to the ‘Moody Mile’|url=https://www.thestar.com/autos/2015/10/09/farewell-to-the-moody-mile-and-was-he-really-going-100-miles-an-hour.html|publisher=TheStar.com|accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1925 to 1971 the Fairgrounds Board contracted with former Indianapolis driver [[Ira Vail]] to promote auto racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fourth National Sprint Car Hall of Fame Inductions|url =http://www.sprintcarhof.com/FileGet.aspx?ID=189|publisher=National Sprint Car Hall of Fame &amp; Museum|accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Vail's promotion, drivers such as Mario Andretti, A.J. Foyt and Al Unser competed for wins during one of the Indianapolis 500's golden era's, putting the Syracuse Mile in the national spotlight. 

On Labor Day 1949 the sportsman modified stock cars took to the track.  The New York State Fair Championship then became a Labor Day a tradition that lasted until 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Fairgrounds' track faces final memories of long racing history| url=http://www.syracuse.com/motorsports/index.ssf/2015/03/fairgrounds_track_faces_final_memories_of_long_racing_history.html |publisher=Syracuse.com |accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Floyd, New York]] driver Cliff Kotary reigned as State Fair Champion for six straight years (1960-1965). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Cliff Kotary dies at 91| url=http://www.uticaod.com/article/20101230/news/312309920 |publisher=Utica Observer Dispatch |accessdate=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1955 the first of three races for what is now referred to as the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series at the fairgrounds. Tim Flock, Buck Baker and Gwyn Staley were victorious in the three events held from 55-57. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The history of the Moody Mile| url=https://360nitro.tv/articles/2014/10/01/the-history-of-the-moody-mile |publisher=360nitro.tv|accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASCAR's Convertible Stock Series also competed in 56 and 57. Curtis Turner and Possum Jones were victorious in those events. 

In 1972, [[Central New York Raceway Park |Glenn Donnelly]] began promoting races at the fairgrounds adding to the Labor Day event with races on the Fourth of July and Columbus Day weekend.  The October race became [[Super Dirt Week|Super DIRT Week]], and continued at the Fairgrounds until 2015.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Fairgrounds' track faces final memories of long racing history| url=http://www.syracuse.com/motorsports/index.ssf/2015/03/fairgrounds_track_faces_final_memories_of_long_racing_history.html |publisher=Syracuse.com |accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buzzie Reutimann]] beat NASCAR Hall of Famer [[Jerry Cook]] for the 1972 Championship. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syracuse's Moody Mile Hosting Final Stock Car Race|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/motor/2015/10/07/syracuse-moody-mile-closing-final-race-finale-new-york-state-fairgrounds/73560972/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brett Hearn]] of [[Kinnelon, New Jersey]], became the all-time win leader at the "Moody Mile," after claiming 6 Super Dirt Week main event victories and 6 "358 Modified" triumphs, the final coming in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Brett Hearn Wins Record 6th Title| url=http://blog.syracuse.com/motorsports/2012/10/hearn_wins_record_sixth_super_dirt_title_in_rain-delayed_rain.html|publisher=Syracuse.com |accessdate=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Brett Hearn Wins 358 Modified Championship| url=http://blog.syracuse.com/motorsports/2014/10/super_dirt_week_2014_brett_hearn_wins_salute_to_the_troops_358-modified_championship.html|publisher=Syracuse.com |accessdate=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==The “Moody Mile”==

The race track was nicknamed "The Moody Mile" after driver Wes Moody turned a 100-mile-per-hour lap in 1970. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Farewell to the ‘Moody Mile’|url=https://www.thestar.com/autos/2015/10/09/farewell-to-the-moody-mile-and-was-he-really-going-100-miles-an-hour.html|publisher=TheStar.com|accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==

In 2015, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a sweeping redesign of the fairgrounds that included taking out what was the 16,000-seat grandstand and mile-long dirt track. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Development plans may doom the dirt mile track at Syracuse, New York|url=https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2015/03/19/development-plans-may-doom-the-dirt-mile-track-at-syracuse-new-york/|publisher=Hemmings Daily|accessdate=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last stock car race was held that year on Columbus day weekend.

'''Weingart Stadium''' (formerly '''ELAC Stadium''') is a 22,355-capacity multi-purpose stadium located at [[East Los Angeles College]], in [[Monterey Park, California]]. It was built in 1951 at a cost of $3.1 million, and following renovations in 1984 it was renamed after philanthropist [[Ben Weingart]].

The stadium played host to all [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]] Olympic [[Field hockey at the 1984 Summer Olympics|field hockey]] matches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt1.pdf 1984 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 1. Part 1. pp. 83-6.&lt;/ref&gt; US Field Hockey played a home game here in 1990. The [[Los Angeles Salsa]] [[soccer]] club called Weingart home in the early 1990s. It is one of the only mid-size stadiums in the western United States that is retrofitted with turf-playing surface certified by the [[Federation International de Football Association]] (FIFA).

Today, although it remains home to the [[East Los Angeles College]] football team, it is best known as the site of the annual [[Garfield High School (Los Angeles County, California)|Garfield High School]]–[[Theodore Roosevelt High School (Los Angeles)|Roosevelt High School]] football game, better known as the [[East LA Classic|East Los Angeles Classic]], which has been responsible for the Stadium's largest crowds, numbering over 25,000.

Commencement ceremonies for local high schools such as [[Schurr High School]] in [[Montebello, California|Montebello]], [[Alhambra High School (Alhambra, California)|Alhambra High School]] in [[Alhambra]] and [[Garfield High School (Los Angeles County, California)|Garfield High School]] in [[Los Angeles]] are held at Weingart Stadium.

==Usage in films==

In the film via Evel Kenvil it was used to simulate a stadium in Mexico were Evel did I motorcycle jump. A Mexican concert was used to draw a crowd in to fill the stadium for the shoot

In the film ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', special effects were used to turn ELAC's Weingart Stadium into the [[University of Alabama]]'s football stadium. Using digital FX, a small crowd which was filmed at ELAC, appears to fill the entire stadium.

On October 19, 2013, during halftime of the ELAC and [[Victor Valley College]] game, the stadium was used as the home field of Gotham City University for the film ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' featuring the superheroes [[Superman]] and [[Batman]]. The scene involved a football game between Gotham City University and rival Metropolis State University.

'''William (Will) Palmer''' (born late 1736 and christened 9 January 1737 in [[Coulsdon]], [[Surrey]]; died February 1790 and buried 8 February 1790 in Coulsdon) was a famous English [[cricket]]er who played in the 1760s and 1770s.

Most of Palmer's career was before cricket's statistical record began in the [[1772 English cricket season]] so relatively little is known of him.  He played in first-class matches until 1776.  He was a noted batsman in his day and had some fine innings in 1773 especially.

Palmer was a member of [[Coulsdon Cricket Club]] in Surrey but he also played a few times for Kent.  In recorded matches from 1772, he made 20 known first-class appearances and took 2 catches but no wickets.  He scored 478 runs in 37 innings with a top score of 68, which is a very good record considering the prevailing conditions that were entirely in the favour of the bowlers.   He made 2 known scores of 50-plus and 4 more that were 25-plus.&lt;ref name=LL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1761.html |title=From Lads to Lord's – profile |accessdate=2009-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153249/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1761.html#palmer |archivedate=10 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Witter Field''' is a baseball [[ballpark]] located at 521 Lincoln Street in [[Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin]], United States. It was built in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raftersbaseball.com/history.html RaftersBaseball.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It served as the home park for multiple [[minor league]] teams: the [[Wisconsin Rapids White Sox]], [[Wisconsin Rapids Senators]] and [[Wisconsin Rapids Twins]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?city=Wisconsin%20Rapids&amp;state=WI&amp;country=US BR Minors]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it hosts the [[Northwoods League]]'s [[Wisconsin Rapids Rafters]] and youth teams.

==Witter Field History==

The ballpark was home to the [[Wisconsin Rapids White Sox]] (1941–42; 1946–53) of the Class-D [[Wisconsin State League]].&lt;ref&gt;http://northwoodsleague.com/wisconsin-rapids-rafters/team/ballpark/&lt;/ref&gt; The League folded after the 1953 season,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalballparks.com/MWL/Witter_640_6.html&lt;/ref&gt; leaving Witter without professional baseball until a new team in the Class-A [[Midwest League]] started play. The  [[Wisconsin Rapids Senators]] (1963) and [[Wisconsin Rapids Twins]] (1964-1983) would play for the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/park.cgi?id=WI031&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the 1983 season, the franchise moved to [[Simmons Field]] in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalballparks.com/MWL/Witter_640_20.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, baseball returned, as the current tenant, the [[Wisconsin Rapids Rafters]] of the summer collegiate [[Northwoods League]] began play in June, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://northwoodsleague.com/wisconsin-rapids-rafters/team/ballpark/&lt;/ref&gt;

The park was built in 1928 and dedicated in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;http://northwoodsleague.com/wisconsin-rapids-rafters/team/ballpark/&lt;/ref&gt; The site housed the Lincoln High School facility, beginning in 1902 and the field was called "Lincoln Athletic Field" until 1940 when it became "Witter Field" in honor of Isaac Witter.&lt;ref&gt;http://wisconsinrapidslegionbaseball.org/witter.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The wooden grandstand bleachers were replaced in 1950. 227 seats from the demolished [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] were installed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://northwoodsleague.com/wisconsin-rapids-rafters/team/ballpark/&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2005-2008 Witter Field hosted the youth WIAC state baseball tournament.&lt;ref&gt;http://wisconsinrapidslegionbaseball.org/witter.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 18, 2011, Witter Field hosted the Northwoods League All-Star Game. [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Paul Molitor]] was present for All-Star festivities.&lt;ref&gt;http://northwoodsleague.com/wisconsin-rapids-rafters/team/ballpark/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The site today==
It is currently the home to local High School baseball, [[American Legion Baseball|Legion Baseball]] and hosts the [[Northwoods League]]'s [[Wisconsin Rapids Rafters]].&lt;ref&gt;http://northwoodsleague.com/wisconsin-rapids-rafters/team/ballpark/&lt;/ref&gt;

The site also contains tennis courts, ice skating, a warming house, a football field and a skate park.&lt;ref&gt;http://visitwisrapids.com/witter-field/&lt;/ref&gt;
