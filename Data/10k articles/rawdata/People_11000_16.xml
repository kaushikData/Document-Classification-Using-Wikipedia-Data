'''Andrew Peter Schillinger''', played by [[Frederick Koehler]], is a fictional character in the [[HBO]] drama ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''.

==Character overview==
''Prisoner 99S333. Convicted February 16, 1999 - Murder in the second degree, possession of narcotics. Sentence: 50 years, up for parole in 20.''

Raised with his brother [[Hank Schillinger|Hank]] by his [[racism|racist]] grandfather Heinrick and equally racist father [[Vern Schillinger]], Andrew has supported the ideology of the [[The Aryan Brotherhood in Oz|Aryan Brotherhood]] throughout his whole life. As a result, he lands in Oz for his part in a [[hate crime]] &amp;mdash; he and a few friends murder a black man by dragging him from the back of a pickup truck (very similar to the [[James Byrd, Jr.|James Byrd]] murder in [[Jasper, Texas]]).

Andrew, however, has a problem that makes his commitment to the brotherhood questionable: he is a full-blown [[heroin]] addict. Andrew's addiction causes problems between him and his father in Oz that eventually result in his death.

When he and Hank were 12 and 10 years old (respectively), Vern nearly murdered a black drug dealer from whom they were trying to buy [[marijuana]], the crime for which he was incarcerated.

==Season 3==
Andrew arrives in Oz for his part in a hate crime (murdering a black man). When in Oz, he looks for drugs immediately and is supplied by [[Irish people|Irish]] inmate [[Ryan O'Reily]]. He has been moved to Emerald City purposefully by unit manager [[Tim McManus]], who hates his father [[Vernon Schillinger]], the head of the Aryan Brotherhood, serving time in Oz's unit B. When Schillinger begs [[Warden Glynn]] to move Andrew to Unit B, Glynn refuses in order to punish him. 

In the cafeteria, Vern sees Andrew drugged out courtesy of O'Reilly and then gets guard [[Len Lopresti]] to take him to the isolation ward for using heroin. Because of Andrew's addiction, Vern tells the brotherhood to ignore him until he is drug free, as the Aryans in Oz oppose the use of drugs. At the same time, the other inmates, including the blacks, who are sickened by his crime, do not make any attempts to kill or [[rape]] Andrew out of fear of Vern's wrath. When Andrew gets back to Emerald City, he is cut off from O'Reilly's drug connections, who claims that Andrew is burning through his supply too fast. O'Reilly then points out that the other dealers in Oz are of other races, who Andrew refuses to buy from.

In drug rehab, Andrew is very disrespectful to [[Sister Peter Marie|Sister Pete]] and his attitude starts a fight between inmates [[Chris Keller]] and [[Tobias Beecher]], which they later reveal was staged. Beecher then befriends Andrew, a move that McManus, the staff, and other inmates question, given Beecher's longstanding feud with Vern. Over a period of time, Beecher helps Andrew beat his addiction, and Andrew befriends O'Reily and Keller as well. As all three are looking to exact revenge on Vern, Schillinger becomes worried that his son will be murdered or raped by any of the three, especially after Beecher taunts Schillinger in the mail room. Meanwhile, as Andrew gets clean, he starts to question the ideology taught to him by his family.

In the cafeteria, Vern speaks with Andrew and hugs him, happy that he is drug free. He claims that he wants have a better relationship with him, but Andrew rejects him, angered by everything that his father stands for. Vern hits him and Andrew retaliates, until the guards, led by Lopresti, take Andrew to the hole. Vern, heartbroken that his son has renounced him, arranges for the guards to take Andrew a package of heroin, as a way of "renouncing" him. Lopresti delivers the heroin to the hole. Andrew at first resists, throwing the package away, but breaks down and then [[drug overdose|overdoses]] on it. As the guards carry Andrew's personal effects out of his cell, Beecher, O'Reilly, and Keller reveal that this was their plan all along.

==Season 6==
His spirit, along with Hank's, narrate the episode "4giveness".

===Murders committed===

* '''Unknown black man''' - Murdered by Andrew, then got 50 years in prison.

==Career==
After his studies, Lal developed interest in archaeology and in 1943, became a trainee in excavation under a veteran British archaeologist, [[Mortimer Wheeler]], starting with [[Taxila]],&lt;ref name=today/&gt; and later at sites such as [[Harappa]] and [[Sisupalgarh]] in [[Odisha]].&lt;ref name=bookReview/&gt; Lal went on to work as an archaeologist for more than fifty years.

In 1968, he was appointed the Director General of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] where he would remain until 1972. Thereafter, Lal served as Director of the [[Indian Institute of Advanced Study|Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, Shimla]].&lt;ref name="BBLalChair"/&gt;

==Archaeological work==
The [[Archaeological Survey of India]] had performed conservation and restoration of [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]], Khwaj Parsa’s Mosque at [[Balkh]] and [[Khwaja Abu Nasr Parsa shrine|the shrine of Khwaja Abu Naser]] under R. Sen Gupta and Lal in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=ASI2&gt;[http://asi.nic.in/asi_abroad.asp Archaeological endeavours abroad], [[Archaeological Survey of India]] Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1950-52, Lal worked on the archaeology of sites accounted for in the Hindu epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', including [[Hastinapura]], the capital city of [[the Kurus]]. He made discoveries of many [[Painted Grey Ware culture|Painted Grey Ware (PGW) sites]] in the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Indo‑Gangetic Divide]] and upper [[Yamuna]]‑[[Ganga]] [[doab]].&lt;ref name=bookReview&gt;[http://ifihhome.tripod.com/bookreviews/sarasvatiflowsonrv.html Book review by Dr. V. N. Misra], Book review of The Saraswati Flows on: the Continuity of Indian Culture, by Chairman of Indian Society for Prehistoric and Quaternary Studies journal Man and Environment; (vol. XXVI, No. 2, July–December 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nubia]], the [[Archaeological Survey of India]], Lal and his team discovered [[Middle stone age|Middle]] and [[Late Stone Age]] tools in the terraces of the river [[Nile]] near Afyeh. The team excavated a few sites at Afyeh and cemetery of C-group people, where 109 graves would be located.&lt;ref name=ASI2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Egypt&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3385173 | pmid=22754242 | doi=10.4103/0971-6866.96686 | volume=18 | title=A comparison of Fulani and Nadar HLA | journal=Indian J Hum Genet | pages=137–8 | author=Winters C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lal worked on [[Mesolithic]] site of Birbhanpur (West Bengal), [[Chalcolithic]] site of [[Gilund]] (Rajasthan) and [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan]] site of [[Kalibangan]] (Rajasthan).

In 1975-76, Lal worked on the "Archaeology of Ramayana Sites" project funded by the ASI, which excavated five sites mentioned in the Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]'' - [[Ayodhya]], Bharadwaj ''[[ashram]]'', [[Nandigram]], [[Chitrakoot district|Chitrakoot]] and [[Shringverpur|Shringaverapur]]. In the seven-page preliminary report submitted to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Lal disclosed the discovery by his team of "pillar bases", immediately south of the [[Babri mosque]] structure in Ayodhya.&lt;ref name=bookReview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = I found pillar bases back in mid-seventies: Prof Lal | url =http://www.indianexpress.com/oldStory/19644/|publisher=Indian Express | accessdate = 9 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. B. B. Lal has published several books and over 150 research papers and articles in national and international scientific journals.&lt;ref name="BBLalChair"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bookReview/&gt; In his 2002 book, ''The Saraswati Flows On'', Lal criticised the earlier [[Indo-Aryan migration|Aryan invasion/migration theory]], arguing that the [[Rig Veda|Rig Vedic]] description of the [[Sarasvati River]] (which dried up by 2000 BCE) as "overflowing" contradicts the claim made by certain previous historians that the Indo-Aryan migration occurred 300 years after they contend the Sarasvati River dried up (in 1500 BCE) and which they also contended had led to the end of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]].&lt;ref name=today/&gt;

== Ayodhya dispute ==
In Lal's 2008 book, ''Rāma, His Historicity, Mandir and Setu: Evidence of Literature, Archaeology and Other Sciences'', he writes (that): 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Attached to the piers of the Babri Masjid, there were twelve stone pillars, which carried not only typical Hindu motifs and mouldings, but also figures of Hindu deities. It was self-evident that these pillars were not an integral part of the Masjid, but were foreign to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ayodhya: High Court relies on ASI's 2003 report|publisher=Economic Times | url = http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-10-01/news/27573745_1_hindu-temple-b-b-lal-asi|date=Oct 1, 2010| accessdate = 9 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
The B. B. Lal Chair at [[Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur]] ([[IIT, Kanpur]]) has been established in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Faculty Chairs | publisher = IIT Kanpur | url = http://www.iitk.ac.in/drpg/facultychair.htm | accessdate = 9 August 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140218220149/http://www.iitk.ac.in/drpg/facultychair.htm | archive-date = 18 February 2014 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British archaeologists [[Stuart Piggott]] and D.H. Gordon describe ''Copper Hoards of the Gangetic Basin'' and the ''Hastinapura Excavation Report'', two of Lal's works published in the ''Journal of the Archaeological Survey of India'', as ''models of research and excavation reporting''.&lt;ref name=bookReview/&gt;

'''Barrett Lancaster Brown''' (born August 14, 1981) is an American journalist, essayist and [[satirist]]. He founded Project PM, a research collaboration and [[wiki]], to facilitate analysis of the troves of hacked emails and other [[Internet leak|leaked information]] concerning the inner workings of the cyber-[[military-industrial complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/barrett-brown-faces-105-years-in-jail-20130905 |title=Barrett Brown Faces 105 Years in Jail |last=Zaitchik |first=Alexander |date=5 September 2013 |website=Rolling Stone |publisher=Rolling Stone |access-date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Brown was sentenced to 63 months in federal prison for the crimes of [[accessory after the fact]], [[obstruction of justice]], and [[threatening the government officials of the United States#Other civil servants|threatening a federal officer]] stemming from the FBI's investigation into the [[2012 Stratfor email leak]]. Prosecutors had previously brought other charges associated with his sharing of an [[Hyperlink#Legal issues|HTTP link]] to the leaked Stratfor data, but those charges were dropped in 2014.&lt;ref name=carr&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2011, Brown had ties with the [[hacktivist]] collective [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]].

==Early life and education==
Brown was born in [[Dallas, Texas]], to Robert Brown and Karen Lancaster, who later divorced.&lt;ref name=rollingstone /&gt; He grew up in Dallas and exhibited an early interest in writing and journalism, creating his own newspapers on his family's computer while attending [[Preston Hollow Elementary School]].&lt;ref name=rollingstone /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Tim. "[http://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/2011/april/how-barrett-brown-helped-overthrow-the-government-of-tunisia?single=1 Barrett Brown is Anonymous]." ''[[D Magazine]]''. April 2011. Retrieved on May 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to contribute to his school newspapers, and interned at several weekly newspapers during his teenage years.&lt;ref name=rollingstone /&gt;&lt;ref name=dmag /&gt; He attended the [[Episcopal School of Dallas]] through his sophomore year of high school, then spent his would-be junior year in [[Tanzania]] with his father who was residing there on business. While in Africa, Brown completed high school online through a [[Texas Tech University]] program, earning college credits as well as his high school diploma.&lt;ref name=dmag /&gt; In 2000 he enrolled at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and spent two semesters taking writing courses before leaving school to pursue a full-time career as a freelance writer.&lt;ref name=rollingstone&gt;{{cite news

==Journalism==

Brown served as the director of communications for ''Enlighten the Vote'', an [[Atheism|atheist]] [[Political action committee|PAC]] that provides financial and strategic assistance to political candidates that advocate strict enforcement of the [[Establishment Clause]].&lt;ref name=ryan&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan Gallagher |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/mar/20/barrett-brown-anonymous-pr-federal-target |title=How Barrett Brown went from Anonymous's PR to federal target|work=The Guardian|accessdate=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/panelists/51376-barrett-brown |title=Barrett Brown |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=August 1, 2012 |accessdate=September 6, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818044050/http://www.businessweek.com/panelists/51376-barrett-brown |archivedate=August 18, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Brown began work on his crowdsourced investigation wiki, Project PM.  Brown has written that the main goals of Project PM are to increase the positive influence of what he calls "the more capable segments of the blogosphere", while reducing the negative influence of well-regarded mainstream pundits, who may have political agendas not compatible with public interest.  It was his aim that the wiki Project PM be established by way of the deliberate generation of critical mass of work and following among dependable bloggers in such a manner as that segments of the traditional media will be prompted or even forced to address critical issues in their own methods and means of reportage. A further and experimental aim of Project PM is also to develop a communicational schematic which could provide bloggers, reporters and any other concerned [[Citizen journalist]] with the best possible feed of raw information by which to produce content.

On the aim of Project PM, Brown has stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The institutions and structures that have developed over the past two decades of accelerating public internet use have had what we reasonably describe as a wholesome effect on information flow. But the information age is a work in progress, and thus there are potential improvements to be made. More importantly, there are improvements that can be made by an initially small number of influential participants working in coordination. The purpose of Project PM is to implement these solutions to the extent that participants are collectively able to do so, as well as to demonstrate the beneficial effects of these solutions to others that they might be spurred to recreate or even build upon them independently of our own efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Barrett Brown|url=http://trueslant.com/barrettbrown/2010/03/24/project-pm/|title=The Great Pundit Hunt – Barrett Brown at True/Slant|publisher=True/Slant|date=March 24, 2010|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In June 2011, he and Project PM released an exclusive report about a surveillance contract called "Romas/COIN" which was discovered in e-mails hacked from HBGary by Anonymous. It consisted of sophisticated data-mining techniques leveraging mobile software and aimed at Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Barrett Brown|url=http://wiki.project-pm.org/wiki/Romas/COIN|title=Romas/COIN|publisher=Project PM|date=June 22, 2011|accessdate=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Barrett Brown|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/22/hacking-anonymous|title=A sinister cyber-surveillance scheme exposed|work=The Guardian|date=June 22, 2011|accessdate=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Brown said that 75 names of members of the [[Zetas (Mexico)|Zetas]] drug cartel would be released if a member of the Anonymous group who had been kidnapped was not set free.&lt;ref name=zetas&gt;{{cite news

 | date=November 4, 2011 | accessdate=October 9, 2013 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Brown says the member was then released and that there was a truce between him and the drug cartel for the moment. Others have said the kidnapping was fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2012, Brown was interviewed by the English language Russian news network [[Russia Today|RT]] about the cyber attacks by Anonymous and the temporary blackout of the US government websites WhiteHouse.Gov, DoJ.gov and FBI.gov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/usa/anonymous-barrettbrown-sopa-megaupload-241/
|title=Internet strikes back: Anonymous' Operation Megaupload explained
|publisher=RT|date=January 20, 2012 |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2012, he confirmed on [[Twitter]] that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] raided his residence after receiving information from [[Hector Xavier Monsegur]] (also known by the online pseudonym Sabu), the founder of [[LulzSec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

In early January 2014, it was announced that his second book, begun in 2006, will be published. According to his legal defense website
&lt;blockquote&gt;The book was originally titled ''Hot, Fat, and Clouded: The Amazing and Amusing Failures of America’s Chattering Class'' and consisted of his attack on the ubiquitous newspaper columnists and media pundits whom he argues are undeservedly influential and able to form public opinion. … We are excited to announce that we have rescued the book from its fate and that it will soon see the light of day. Newly titled as ''Keep Rootin’ for Putin: Establishment Pundits and the Twilight of American Competence'', the text become available as an eBook in the spring of 2014 for donors to his legal defense fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rogers|first=Tim|title=Barrett Brown Book Will Be Released After All|url=http://frontburner.dmagazine.com/2014/01/06/barrett-brown-book-will-be-released-after-all/|accessdate=January 8, 2014|newspaper=D Magazine|date=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From September 2012, during his incarceration, Brown wrote a series of columns for [[D Magazine]] titled "The Barrett Brown Review of Arts and Letters and Jail".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frontburner.dmagazine.com/author/barrettbrown/ |title=The Barrett Brown Review of Arts and Letters and Jail |work=D Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 he transitioned from [[D Magazine|D]] to [[The Intercept]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freebarrettbrown.org/2015/07/08/announcement-barrett-brown-is-courages-fifth-beneficiary/ |title=Announcement: Barrett Brown is Courage’s fifth beneficiary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frontburner.dmagazine.com/2015/07/10/barrett-brown-gives-d-magazine-the-middle-finger-leaves-frontburner-for-more-fertile-greenwald-grounds/ |title=Barrett Brown Gives D Magazine the Middle Finger, Leaves FrontBurner for More Fertile Greenwald Grounds |author=Tim Rogers |work=[[D Magazine]] |date=Jul 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/07/16/barrett-brown-review-prison/ |title=A Visit to the Sweat Lodge |author=Barrett Brown |date=July 16, 2015 |work=[[The Intercept]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 The Intercept won a [[National Magazine Award]] for three of Barrett's columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magazine.org/asme/ellie-awards-2016-winners-announced |title=Ellie Awards 2016 Winners Announced |work=American Society of Magazine Editors |date=February 3, 2016 |accessdate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and trial==
On March 6, 2012, the FBI executed search warrants at Brown's apartment and his mother's house seeking evidence of alleged crimes. The items to be seized included "Records relating to HBGary, Infragard, Endgame Systems, Anonymous, LulzSec, IRC Chats, Twitter, wiki.echelon2.org, and pastebin.com." Agents took possession of his laptop computers. "I suspect that the FBI is working off of incorrect information," Brown told a reporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Surveillance of contacts and sympathizers ==
In 2017, lawyers for donors to Brown's legal fund filed suit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freebarrettbrown.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Barrett-Brown-donors-complaint.pdf|title=Class-action complaint for violation of right to speak and associate anonymously under the first amendment of the United States Constitution; the Stored Communications Act; and the California constitutional right to privacy: demand for jury trial|author=Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton LLP|date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; against Assistant United States Attorney Candina Heath for filing a subpoena against [[WePay]] that resulted in divulgence of their identities.  The lawyers argued that the irrelevance of donor information to the case against Brown and the provision of the information directly to Special Agent Robert Smith of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] rather than to the prosecutor or judge in the trial led to donors' belief that the information was intended to surveil and harass the donors for activity protected by the U.S. constitution, and filed for destruction of the data and monetary damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freebarrettbrown.org/2017/05/12/us-government-moves-to-dismiss-our-lawsuit/|title=US government moves to dismiss our lawsuit on behalf of donors|publisher=The Courage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/40779-we-don-t-have-the-rule-of-law-barrett-brown-on-incarceration-journalism-and-his-next-steps|title="We Don't Have the Rule of Law": Barrett Brown on Incarceration, Journalism and His Next Steps|author=Candice Bernd|publisher=Truth-out.org|date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 2, 2017, Judge Maria Elena James denied a motion to dismiss the case introduced by the Department of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/judge-barrett-brown-donors-can-sue-government-over-subpoenaed-records/|title=Judge: Barrett Brown donors can sue government over subpoenaed records|last=Farivar|first=Cyrus|date=October 4, 2017|work=Ars Technica|access-date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his sentencing statement, Brown alleged that, despite the denial of a subpoena by the judge to which he was making the statement, the identities of all contributors to the echelon2.org public [[Wiki]] had been obtained "by other means",  and that "now the dozens of people who have given their time and expertise to what has been hailed by journalists and advocacy groups as a crucial journalistic enterprise are now at risk of being indicted under the same sort of spurious charges that I was facing not long ago, when the government exposed me to decades of prison time for copying and pasting a link to a publicly available file that other journalists were also linking to without being prosecuted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2015/01/22/read-the-statement-barrett-bro.html|title=Read the statement Barrett Brown read to the court in his sentencing hearing|publisher=BoingBoing.net|date=2015-01-22|author=Xeni Jardin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernd /&gt;

'''Blake Alexander Carrington''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', created by [[Richard and Esther Shapiro]]. The role was portrayed by [[John Forsythe]] from the [[Oil (Dynasty)|1981 pilot episode]] until the series finale in 1989. Forsythe returned for the 1991 [[miniseries]] ''[[Dynasty: The Reunion]]''. In [[The CW]]'s [[Dynasty (2017 TV series)|2017 reboot of the series]], Blake is played by [[Grant Show]].

Patriarch of the [[Carrington family]], self-made CEO of monolithic Denver-Carrington, and the principal character of the series, oil tycoon Blake Carrington is initially a ruthless man in both business and family matters. The character soon softens into a more benevolent patriarchal figure due to the influence of actor Forsythe.

Weeks later, attorney Michael Torrance from [[Billings, Montana]] approaches Blake and claims to be Adam. Though Alexis believes him, Blake does not, but he eventually accepts Adam as his son.

He accepts his sister after his father, [[Tom Carrington (Dynasty character)|Tom Carrington]], admits on his deathbed that she is his daughter. A few months later, Blake learns that Alexis had another child after they divorced, a daughter she named [[Amanda Carrington|Amanda]]. Although Alexis initially denies that he is Amanda's father, Blake eventually learns that she is, in fact, his daughter. At Christmas, Blake is thrilled when Krystle has a baby girl they name [[Krystina Carrington|Krystina]]. Although her health is fragile at first, she survives and thrives.

Blake's health deteriorates until he is almost completely incapacitated. Sammy Jo learns the truth and helps Krystle escape captivity. Joel and Rita disappear. Blake is furious when his brother [[Ben Carrington|Ben]] returns to Denver. In league with Alexis, Ben sues for his share of their late father's estate. Blake mortgages his house and holdings, expecting to gain control over ColbyCo. Thanks to Ben and Alexis's interference, he loses everything, including his lucrative South China Sea oil leases. In the season finale, he learns that Alexis has bought his house. Furious, he grabs her by the throat and starts to strangle her.

====Season seven====

Blake is charged with arson, but eventually the charges are dropped when it is revealed that Claudia was responsible for the blaze. As Blake continues to try and regain his empire, he discovers that the land he inherited from his mother is rich in natural gas. However, he is forced to temporarily halt his plans to develop on the land when Alexis and Ben learn of its existence. Soon after, [[Emily Fallmont]] gives incriminating information about Alexis and Ben to Blake, who uses it to force them to relinquish their ownership of Denver-Carrington and all its holdings back to him, including the South China Sea oil leases. Later, Blake, Alexis, and Ben are in southeast Asia inspecting an oil rig when it catches fire. Ben rescues a trapped Blake moments before the rig explodes. Blake awakens in the hospital with no memories of the last 25 years. Alexis has him discharged from the hospital and convinces him that they are still married. However, when Krystle finds them, Blake's memories return. Blake and Krystle's daughter, Krystina, falls ill and needs a heart transplant. A donor is found and Krystina is saved, but the donor's mother, [[Sarah Curtis (Dynasty character)|Sarah Curtis]], kidnaps Krystina. She is later recovered, unharmed. In the season finale, Blake and Alexis legally adopt Adam.

====Season eight====
Blake runs for governor, opposed by the incumbent and Alexis. After a long and grueling campaign, both he and Alexis lose. Not long after, Blake returns home to find his bedroom in disarray and Krystle missing. He says, "Oh, Krystle, I thought we had more time!"

====Season nine====
Krystle has a serious brain tumor and must have risky surgery. They fly to Switzerland, where the surgery is successful, but Krystle is left in a coma. A body is found at the bottom of a lake on the Carrington property. It turns out to be Roger Grimes, the man with whom Alexis was having the affair that caused her and Blake's divorce. Roger has been dead for 20 years, but the cold temperatures in the lake preserved his body. Ultimately, it is revealed that 8-year-old Fallon had shot Roger after finding him beating Alexis, and Blake's late father Tom had hidden the body in a mine under the lake to protect Fallon. The situation is complicated by the fact that the mine is full of stolen Nazi treasure, hidden there by Tom. In the last episode of the series, Blake learns that the police captain investigating Roger's murder is searching for the treasure. Blake attempts to force a confession. The captain pulls a gun, and they both shoot. Blake is left lying in a pool of blood.

====''The Reunion''====
Three years later, in ''[[Dynasty: The Reunion]]'' (1991), Blake has fully recovered from his gunshot injury and is being released from jail after being exonerated for the fatal shooting of Captain Handler. Along with his sons, Steven and Adam, and former son-in-law [[Jeff Colby]], Blake attempts to regain control of Denver-Carrington from an international consortium. Krystle returns, having come out of her coma, but has been programmed by the Consortium to assassinate Blake. Her love for Blake proves to be too strong, and breaks the Consortium's control over her.

===Characterization===
Executive producer [[Josh Schwartz]] said that, according to series creator [[Esther Shapiro]], "Blake Carrington was a guy who could run this amazing company, but the one place that he really struggles is running his own family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/10/11/dynasty-reboot-preview/|title=''Dynasty'' producers talk reimagining the beloved primetime soap|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Samantha|last=Highfill|date=October 11, 2017|accessdate=November 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Showrunner [[Sallie Patrick]] described Blake as  "a white patriarch who is in a changing world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-ca-st-fall-preview-dynasty-reboot-lessons-20170908-htmlstory.html|title=The do's and don'ts of reboots: ''Dynasty'' edition|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Yvonne|last=Villarreal|date=September 8, 2017|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She noted, "I love Grant Show's warmth when he lies directly to his son's face about having returned the phone. That's just one of the skills that make Blake Carrington the multi-billion dollar magnate that he is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/10/25/dynasty-episode-3-blog-sallie-patrick/|title=''Dynasty'' showrunner takes you behind the scenes of that drama-filled gala|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Sallie|last=Patrick|date=October 25, 2017|accessdate=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Show said, "Blake Carrington is not just your average soap opera character. He's very complex. He's a protagonist, but a very flawed protagonist. I was intrigued by that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.com/tv/grant-show-melrose-place-dynasty/|title='90s Heartthrob Grant Show Reveals Which ''Melrose Place'' Costar He'd Love to Reunite with|work=People|first=Dana Rose|last=Falcone|date=October 6, 2017|accessdate=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
Maureen Ryan of ''Variety'' called Grant Show "personable and charismatic" in the role, but noted that "a few corporate moves that are meant to make Blake seem deviously brilliant make him look anything but." She added, "If you’re going to base a show around the machinations of a brilliant and ruthless mastermind, his strokes of genius should seem whipsmart and diabolically genius, not predictable or even puzzling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://variety.com/2017/tv/reviews/dynasty-review-cw-reboot-1202584620/|title=TV Review: ''Dynasty'' Reboot on The CW|first=Maureen|last=Ryan|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 9, 2017|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl McCoy''' (born 18 January 1963, [[Lambeth]], [[London]], England){{cn|date=April 2016}} is the [[frontman]] for [[gothic rock]] band [[Fields of the Nephilim]].

==Biography==
The band formed in 1984. Following on from two [[Extended play|EP]]s, their first album ''[[Dawnrazor]]'' was released in 1987. They produced two more full-length albums, ''[[The Nephilim (album)|The Nephilim]]'' and ''[[Elizium]]'', plus a live album called ''[[Earth Inferno]]'' and a handful of singles, before splitting in 1991. McCoy went on to form [[Nefilim]]. The 1996 release of Nefilim's album ''[[Zoon]]'' saw a departure from the ethereal gothic sound of ''Elizium'' in favour of an [[industrial metal]] and [[death metal]] direction.&lt;ref name="Goth Chic"/&gt;

McCoy's most recent studio album, ''[[Mourning Sun]]'', was released in 2005. Although it was released under the name [[Fields of the Nephilim]], McCoy has been secretive about the musicians who play on ''Mourning Sun'', with John 'Capachino' Carter the only named contributor. The album was conceived and produced in McCoy's studio.

McCoy frequently uses mystical and [[occult]] references in his lyrics. Samples of [[Aleister Crowley]]'s voice were featured on ''Elizium'';&lt;ref name="Goth Chic"/&gt; one of Fields of the Nephilim's biggest hits, "Moonchild", shares a name with one of Crowley's [[Moonchild (novel)|novels]].

In interviews, McCoy has hinted that he sees his on-stage performances as theurgic, [[Witchcraft|magickal]] or [[shamanic]] workings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Quietus {{!}} Features {{!}} A Quietus Interview {{!}} Into The Subconscious: Fields Of The Nephilim Interviewed|url = http://thequietus.com/articles/08546-fields-of-the-nephilim-interview|website = The Quietus|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} He is also an admirer of [[Austin Osman Spare]] (the name of the Fields of the Nephilim live album ''Earth Inferno'' comes from one of Spare's works) and has thanked "AOS" in dedications on his albums. In another nod to [[chaos magic]], Fields of the Nephilim's song ''[[Psychonaut]]'' shares its name with a book on the subject by [[Peter J. Carroll]], and quotes lines from the ''[[Necronomicon]]''. McCoy's lyrics are heavily influenced by the work of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and mention [[Cthulhu Mythos|Cthulhu]] in several places.

McCoy owns a graphics company, Sheerfaith, which has supplied art and design for all of his musical projects. Sheerfaith has also produced artwork for other projects, such as for the [[Storm Constantine]] book ''Hermetech'' and Andrew Collins' ''21st Century Grail''. He himself is a 3D artist, a longtime user of [[LightWave 3D]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sumerland.devin.com/articles/sheerfaith-computerarts.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

McCoy appeared as the nomad in the motion picture ''[[Hardware (film)|Hardware]]'' (1990), directed by [[Richard Stanley (film director)|Richard Stanley]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0566710/ IMDB page on McCoy]&lt;/ref&gt; who had previously directed a number of videos for Fields of the Nephilim.

==Personal life==
McCoy has two daughters, Scarlett and Eden, with his long-time partner Lynn. The Nephilim's 1996 album ''Zoon'' was dedicated to Scarlett. Both girls sing on ''Mourning Sun''. McCoy comes from a religious background; he grew up in England with his mother, who was deeply religious, a [[Jehovah's Witness]].&lt;ref name="Goth Chic"/&gt; McCoy later dealt with his relation to Christianity critically in some of his songs such as "Chord of Souls".&lt;ref name="Goth Chic"&gt;Baddeley: Goth Chic. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; He has talked in interviews about his belief in [[paganism]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=bB8D1Fm2G4kC&amp;pg=PA35&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Brown''' (born June 9, 1895)&lt;ref name="statistics"&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/nlb/player.cgi?id=brown-008dav "Dave Brown Negro League Statistics &amp; History"]. baseball-reference.com. Retrieved June 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="draftrego" /&gt; was a left-handed [[pitcher]] in [[Negro league baseball]]. Considered one of the better pitchers in negro league history, he was also known for serious off-the-field problems. His career came to a premature end when he became a fugitive after allegedly killing a man in 1925.

==Early career==
Brown was born in [[Leon County, Texas]].&lt;ref name="statistics"/&gt;  He had a good [[curveball]] and excellent control. He was also a good fielder and had outstanding speed but was a weak hitter. Brown played with the Dallas Black Giants in 1917 and 1918.&lt;ref name="Dallas1918"&gt;[http://negroleagues.bravehost.com/pdf/001945.pdf "Plenty of Baseball Provided for Fans of Dallas Today" Dallas Morning News, Dallas, Texas, Sunday, August 11, 1918, Page 8, Column 2]&lt;/ref&gt; He was regarded as a "timid nice guy" who did not cause trouble, but during his time with the [[Dallas Black Giants]] he was involved in a highway [[robbery]].&lt;ref name="Riley117"&gt;Riley, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Brown was reported to have become a fugitive, [[Rube Foster]] agreed to pay $20,000 for Brown's [[parole]] and he became a member of Foster's [[Chicago American Giants]].&lt;ref name="Riley117" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cottrell165"&gt;Cottrell, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chicago American Giants Seasons==

[[File:Chicago American Giants 1919.jpg|left|thumb|230px|1919 Chicago American Giants]]
Brown became the [[ace (baseball)|ace]] of the American Giants as they dominated negro league baseball in the early 1920s. From 1920 through 1922, he posted a 29-8 [[Win (baseball)|record]] in league games.&lt;ref name="Riley117" /&gt;  His 11-3 record led them to a pennant win in 1921 including three victories in a playoff with the [[Bacharach Giants]].&lt;ref name="Riley117" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cottrell160"&gt;Cottrell, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  His 8-3 record contributed to another pennant in 1922.&lt;ref name="Cottrell163"&gt;Cottrell, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the winter following the 1922 season, Brown joined [[Oscar Charleston]] for the first season of the [[Cuban League]]'s [[Santa Clara Leopardos]].&lt;ref name="Heaphy1734"&gt;Heaphy, pp. 173-174.&lt;/ref&gt;

==League change and abrupt career end==
For the 1923 season, Brown left Rube Foster's American Giants for the brand new [[Eastern Colored League]]. Foster voiced his displeasure, pointing out that Brown had been paroled to him and that he had promised Brown's mother to take care of him. He pointed out that the public would vilify him if he revoked.&lt;ref name="Cottrell165"&gt;Cottrell, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;  Brown posted a losing record in his first season with the [[New York Lincoln Giants]] but he and Charleston returned to Cuba the following winter and helped Santa Clara compile one of the best records in Cuban baseball history.&lt;ref name="Riley118"&gt;Riley, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heaphy174"&gt;Heaphy, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;  His second season with the Lincoln Giants improved on the first and he defeated "Cannonball" [[Dick Redding]] and the [[Brooklyn Royal Giants]] to win the [[New York City]] championship.&lt;ref name="Riley117" /&gt;

Brown's career came to an abrupt end in 1925. He went to a bar one night with [[Frank Wickware]] and [[Oliver Marcelle]].&lt;ref name="Riley118" /&gt;&lt;ref name="James184"&gt;James, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;  Marcelle was a [[third baseman]] with a reputation for trouble off the field.&lt;ref name="James184" /&gt;  A fight erupted at the bar, possibly involving [[cocaine]], and Brown killed one of the participants {Benjamin Adair} &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&amp;ccid=xuRyoXXZ&amp;id=1FED3D391F21EF77D788FA6F811D417EE2C683BF&amp;thid=OIP.xuRyoXXZvKBzpI0ir5FOzAHaGf&amp;mediaurl=http%3a%2f%2fcardsthatneverwere.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2flefty-brown.jpg&amp;exph=1173&amp;expw=1339&amp;q=Wanted++Poster+Lefty+Dave+Brown&amp;simid=608036985236556903&amp;selectedIndex=1&amp;ajaxhist=0 Cards that never were]&lt;/ref&gt; April 27,1925&lt;ref&gt;[The League of Outsider Baseball: An Illustrated History of Baseball's ...By Gary Cieradkowski pp. 128-129]&lt;/ref&gt;. Wickware and Marcelle were questioned the next day at the ballpark, but Brown had disappeared.&lt;ref name="Riley118" /&gt;

==Rumors and legacy==
The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] searched for Brown but he was never officially seen again. Rumors abounded that he continued playing baseball under the alias "Lefty Wilson" with [[semi-professional]] teams through the [[Midwestern United States]]. Lefty Wilson toured with [[Gilkerson's Union Giants]] in 1926,&lt;ref name="gilkerson1926"&gt;[https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B1Wcncq5-bHdVWFYMENhekRMUVk "Gilkerson Union Giants Swamp Knights of Columbus Nine 11 to 4" Davenport Democrat and Leader, Davenport, IA, Monday Evening, June 21, 1926, Page 7, Columns 1 and 2]&lt;/ref&gt; a white team in [[Bertha, Minnesota]] in 1927 and 1928, and he was rumored to have played in [[Sioux City, Iowa]] in 1929 and [[Little Falls, Minnesota]] in 1930. More unsubstantiated rumors claimed that Brown died in mysterious circumstances in [[Denver, Colorado]] in 1930.&lt;ref name="Riley118" /&gt; However, Lefty Wilson shows up again pitching for the [[Gilkerson's Union Giants]] again in 1932. Reportedly, he was alive in 1938 &lt;ref&gt;[See The League of Outsider Baseball: An Illustrated History of Baseball's ...By Gary Cieradkowski p.129 for a 1938 report of Brown]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1927, a ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]'' column solicited opinions for the best black baseball player of all time. On April 2, [[John Henry Lloyd]] announced his list which included Dave Brown.&lt;ref name="Cottrell175"&gt;Cottrell, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the ''Pittsburgh Courier'' announced a similar list in 1952, they included Brown on their second team.&lt;ref name="Cottrell182"&gt;Cottrell, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francisco de Ibarra''' (1539 &amp;ndash;June 3, 1575) was a [[Basque people|Basque]] [[explorer]], founder of the city of [[Durango, Durango|Durango]], and [[governor]] of the Spanish province of [[Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain|Nueva Vizcaya]], in present-day [[Durango]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]].

==Biography==
Francisco de Ibarra was born about 1534 in [[Eibar]], [[Gipuzkoa]], in the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] of [[Spain]].  He went to [[Mexico]] as a young man, and upon the recommendation and financing of his uncle, [[conquistador]] and wealthy mine owner [[Diego de Ibarra]], Francisco was placed at the head of an expedition to explore northwest from [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]] in 1554.  The young Ibarra noted silver in the vicinity of present-day [[Fresnillo]], but passed it by.  He explored further and founded towns at San Martín and Avino, where the silver mines made him a mine owner in his own right.&lt;ref&gt;P. J. Bakewell (1971) ''Silver Mining and Society in Colonial Zacatecas 1546–1700'', Cambridge: University Press, p. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibarra's expedition to Zacatecas was later documented by Spanish historian [[Baltasar Obregón]], who traveled with Ibarra in 1554.

In 1562, Ibarra headed another expedition to push farther into northwest Mexico. In particular, he was searching for the fabled golden city of Copala (also called [[Seven Cities of Gold|Cibola]]).  He did not find the mythical treasure, but explored and conquered what is now the Mexican state of [[Durango (state)|Durango]]. Ibarra was appointed governor of the newly formed province of Nueva Vizcaya (New Biscay) in 1562, and the following year he founded the city of [[Durango, Durango|Durango]] to be its capital.&lt;ref name="Bannon_1970_Borderlands"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Spanish Borderlands Frontier, 1513-1821 |author=[[John Francis Bannon]]|location=Albuquerque |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston |year=1970 |edition=1 |isbn=0030851696 |OCLC=5685684 |pages=308 |series=Histories of the American frontier}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29,53-4}}

In 1564, Ibarra, following rumors of rich mineral deposits, crossed the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] to conquer what is now southern [[Sinaloa]].  Prospectors discovered silver veins in the new territory, and in 1565, de Ibarra founded the towns of [[Copala, Sinaloa|Copala]] and [[:es:Pánuco (Sinaloa)]].

Soldiers under Ibarra's direction explored north from [[Durango]] in 1567, and founded the town of [[Santa Bárbara, Chihuahua|Santa Bárbara]] in present-day [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] to mine the silver they found there.

Francisco de Ibarra died on 3 June 1575 in [[Pánuco, Sinaloa]], one of the silver-mining cities that he founded.&lt;ref&gt;José Ignacio Gallegos (1960) ''Durango Colonial, 1563–1821'', Mexico City: Editorial Jus, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Haruhi Fujioka'''|藤岡 ハルヒ|Fujioka Haruhi}} is a fictional character from the [[manga]] series ''[[Ouran High School Host Club]]'', which was created by [[Bisco Hatori]]. In the [[manga]] and its adaptations, Haruhi takes on the role of male host with a comical [[tsukkomi]]-archetype, despite being of [[female|female sex]]; keeping her sex secret from the [[Host and hostess clubs|host club]]'s female clients. Haruhi's character was positively received, both because of her fluid [[gender]] and her down-to-earth personality.

==Character==
[[File:Haruna Kawaguchi as Haruhi Fujioka.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Haruna Kawaguchi]] was sixteen years old when she portrayed Haruhi in [[Ouran High School Host Club (film)|her first feature-length film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-12-08/miwa-to-sing-ouran-high-school-host-club-film-theme|publisher=''Anime News Network''|title=Miwa to Sing Ouran High School Host Club Film's Theme|last=Sherman|first=Jennifer|date=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Caitlin Glass by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|[[Caitlin Glass]], who voices the character in English, referred to her work in ''Ouran'' as a passion project.]]

At the start of the ''Ouran High School Host Club'' manga and [[anime]], Haruhi enters the prestigious Ouran Academy on a [[scholarship]]. Looking for a quiet place to study, she stumbles upon the school's male-only [[Host and hostess clubs|host club]], where she was initially mistaken for a boy due to her short hair and gender-neutral clothing. After knocking over a highly expensive vase, the club forces her to work away her debt. Having a "[[gender-blind|low perception of gender]]", Haruhi joins the club as a host, keeping her sex secret from the club's clientele.&lt;ref name="top 5 queer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/top-5-queer-voices-anime-manga/|publisher=''[[The Mary Sue]]''|title=The Top 5 Queer Voices in Anime and Manga|last=Figa|first=Alenka|date=2015-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the story, Haruhi dislikes being forced to work for the host club. However, as the plot advances, Haruhi slowly grows less introverted and starts to realize that the boys of the host club have become her best friends who are helping her learn and grow to be a better person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capsulecomputers.com.au/2012/10/ouran-high-school-host-club-series-collection-review/|publisher=''Capsule Computers''|title=Ouran High School Host Club Series Collection Review|last=Elawar|first=Zac|date=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapters consist of comedic explorations of [[shoujo]] [[clichés]] and [[gender performance]]. Unlike other shoujo heroines that ''Ouran High School Host Club'' parodies, Haruhi is an independent, hard-working [[asocial]] ''[[tsukkomi]]''-type character who embraces a [[genderqueer]] or "gender-ambivalent" identity.&lt;ref name=DailyDot&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/geek/transgender-characters-anime-boston/|publisher=''[[The Daily Dot]]''|title=When it comes to transgender representation, anime has room to grow|last=Romano|first=Aja|date=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[Caitlin Glass]], the English voice actress of Haruhi, has noted that the character is both among her most challenging and her favorite roles. In an interview with [[Swerve (magazine)|''Swerve'']], she described how difficult it was to "believably [be] a boy [while] still appealing even to a male audience." Taking the dual role of [[Television director|director]] and lead character, Glass said she felt like she had "something to prove" and, initially, she was under great pressure.&lt;ref name="Glass interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theswervemagazine.com/Caitlin_Glass.html|title=No Glass Ceiling|publisher=''[[Swerve (magazine)|The Swerve Magazine]]''|last=Regina|first=Steven|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025043339/http://www.theswervemagazine.com/Caitlin_Glass.html|archivedate=2014-10-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Afro Samurai of ''[[IGN]]'' listed Haruhi among his 25 "greatest anime characters". Stating that while the [[reverse harem]] genre of anime had been "done to death" by the time the ''Ouran High School Host Club'' anime was released, Haruhi's character went against the established tropes of the genre. Described as "super [[tomboy]]ish, demure, and not at all [[moe (slang)|moe]]," Haruhi is considered a good contrast to the eccentric cast of rich boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/04/top-25-greatest-anime-characters|publisher=''[[IGN]]''|title=Top 25 greatest anime characters|author=Afro Samurai|date=2014-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an anime review, ''IGN''{{'}}s D.F. Smith praised both Caitlin Glass and [[Maaya Sakamoto]] for their performance as Haruhi in their respective languages, reporting that it is a "tricky role".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=D.F. Smith|title= IGN: Ouran High School Host Club Season 1 - Part 1 Review|url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/922/922943p1.html|publisher=''IGN''|date=2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakamoto was nominated for a [[1st Seiyu Awards|Seiyu Award]] in 2007 for her portrayal of Haruhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.seiyuawards.jp/center.html | script-title=ja:各部門ランキング　中間発表 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116222131/http://www.seiyuawards.jp/center.html | archivedate=2007-01-16 | language=Japanese | publisher=[[Seiyu Awards]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose Bridges of ''[[Anime News Network]]'' lauded Haruhi as one of the "freshest elements" of the anime. Comparing Haruhi to [[Tohru Honda]] from ''[[Fruits Basket]]'' and Tsukushi Makino from ''[[Boys Over Flowers]]'' because of her strong sense of [[empathy]] and her "take-no-crap" attitude respectively, Bridges praised the character for her intelligence, ability to speak her mind and her "blasé approach to gender roles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2015-09-02/the-secret-revolution-of-ouran-high-school-host-club/.92432|publisher=''Anime News Network''|title=The Secret Revolution of Ouran High School Host Club|last=Bridges|first=Rose|date=2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Mary Sue]]'', Alenka Figa listed Haruhi at the top of her top five queer characters in anime. Noting that plots based on gender confusion are common in anime, Figa states that the trope was subverted quickly when Haruhi admits to her gender-blindness in the first episode.&lt;ref name="top 5 queer" /&gt; Aja Romano of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' pointed Haruhi out as one of the "rare cases" where a character in an anime embraces a genderqueer or "gender-ambivalent" identity, refusing to return to what she described as "safely [[heteronormative]] territory."&lt;ref name=DailyDot /&gt;

Born in 1962, Al-Huraiti worked as a judge, a lawyer, and a professor before being elected to the National Assembly in 2006. Al-Huraiti is an Independent deputy who is on good terms with the [[Al-Sabah]] royal family.

== Minister of Justice and Islamic Affairs ==
Al-Huraiti is also the Minister of Justice and Islamic Affairs, the only elected MP in the cabinet. Kuwaiti law requires the government to include at least one elected lawmaker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gNFx4Jgt4TFBg5Cr5v88LGmq_YpQ Al-Huraiti's cabinet appointment]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 19, 2008, Al-Huraiti told the Kuwait Times that he had met with Education Minister Nouriya Al-Sabeeh and heard from her replies to a number of questions related to the grilling and he was satisfied with her answers. The lawmaker also said that Sabeeh needed more time to execute her promised reforms. Al-Huraiti had previously been widely expected to back the no-confidence vote. He is one of seven MPs from the Awazem, the largest tribe in the country, whose other six MPs have already declared they would vote against the minister.

'''Iacob Melcon Iacobovici''' (November 18, 1879 &amp;ndash; October 9, 1959) was a [[Romania]]n surgeon.

==Biography==

===Origins and early career===
Born in [[Răchiți|Costești]], [[Botoșani County]], his family were peasants of [[Armenians in Romania|Armenian origin]] who had arrived in the [[Moldavia]] region over a century earlier. His parents Melcon and Roza were poor, which meant that their son struggled materially as he passed through [[A. T. Laurian National College|A. T. Laurian High School]] in [[Botoșani]] and the [[University of Bucharest]]'s medical faculty. He graduated from the latter institution in 1905 with a thesis on fetal arteriology that he defended before professors [[Paul Petrini]], [[Thoma Ionescu]], [[Dimitrie Gerota]], [[Anastasie Obregia]] and [[Dimitrie Drăghicescu]]. The work earned him a ''magna cum laude'' degree and a letter of commendation from [[Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz|Wilhelm von Waldeyer]]. While a student, he became an extern in 1901, an intern at [[Spitalul Brâncovenesc]] in 1902, and an assistant in the anatomy department the same year.&lt;ref name="s423"&gt;Sârbu, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Iacobovici won a competition to become assistant to Ionescu at [[Colțea Hospital]]. In 1912, he became consulting physician at the same institution, as well as librarian of the medical faculty. He remained in [[Bucharest]] until 1919, taking part as a [[combat medic]] in the [[Second Balkan War]] and [[World War I]]. He wrote numerous scientific publications and proposed several new surgical techniques. In October 1919, following the [[union of Transylvania with Romania]] and the establishment of a medical faculty within the new [[Cluj University]], he was named head of the surgical clinic at [[Cluj]], with the rank of full professor.&lt;ref name="s423"/&gt;

===At Cluj and return to Bucharest===
The clinic Iacobovici set up included laboratories for biochemistry, urology, endoscopy, morphology and dissection, as well as ambulatory and emergency departments and sections for trauma, orthopedics, urology and chest surgery. In 1922, he edited a textbook on upper abdominal surgery. In 1926, together with several collaborators, he published a [[propaedeutic]]s of surgery, the first of its kind in Romania. He served as university rector in 1922-1923, and during his term established Cluj University Press, the country's first [[university press]].&lt;ref name="s423"/&gt; In May 1923, as he was walking from his bedroom to his dining room one evening, an assailant fired four shots at him from the street, but missed. The police were convinced the deed was the work of a disgruntled anti-Semitic student.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

When Iacobovici arrived in Transylvania, there were almost no Romanian surgeons in the province, methods of surgery were obsolete and Romanian-language teaching materials were scarce. Starting under these conditions, he managed to train surgeons who developed departments throughout Transylvania and even in the former [[Romanian Old Kingdom|Old Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="s423"/&gt; In 1929, when he had Alexandru Pop appointed lecturer and, implicitly, his successor as clinic head, nearly all the senior physicians quit and went to other cities. In ten years, Iacobovici trained some forty surgeons, who later became department heads and, in some cases, university professors.&lt;ref name="s424"&gt;Sârbu, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; Among the types of operations in which he innovated were surgery for gastric ulcer, biliary bypass, tuberculosis, lumbar region, neurovegetative features and war wounds; as well as working on thyroid pathology, pulmonary exeresis and renal tumors.&lt;ref name="s425"/&gt;

Following the accidental death in 1933 of [[Ernest Juvara]], head of the surgery clinic at Spitalul Brâncovenesc, Iacobovici was named as his replacement. At Bucharest, he continued working for a further fifteen years. He created yet another school of surgeons, founded the country's first emergency hospital in 1934, and in 1935 was a founding member of the Romanian Medical Academy. Taken together, around twenty professors emerged from under his tutelage at Cluj and Bucharest. During the [[National Legionary State]], he was temporarily removed from his post of clinic director. After [[World War II]], he showed increasing signs of [[Parkinson's disease]] and cardiac sclerosis. He asked to retire in 1947, and left the clinic for good in 1949. He died in 1959 and, in accordance with his last will, was immediately incinerated at [[Cremation in Romania|Cenușa Crematorium]] in a simple ceremony. He donated three buildings in Bucharest and his villa at [[Târgu Ocna]] to what was now the [[Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy]].&lt;ref name="s425"&gt;Sârbu, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Langley Dalton''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]] (1833 – 7 January 1887) was an [[England|English]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces for service at the [[Battle of Rorke's Drift]] during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]].

==Military career==
Born in [[London]] in 1833, Dalton enlisted in [[85th Regiment of Foot]] in November 1849 at the age of 17.  In 1862 he transferred to the Commissariat Corps at the rank of [[corporal]], and was promoted to [[sergeant]] in 1863, and clerk and [[staff sergeant]] in 1867. He served with [[Sir Garnet Wolseley]] on the [[Wolseley Expedition|Red River Expedition]] in Canada in 1870, retiring from the army the next year. By 1877, he was living in South Africa and volunteered for service as Acting Assistant Commissary with the British Force.

===Victoria Cross===
Dalton was approximately 46 years old, and an acting assistant [[commissary]] in the [[Commissariat and Transport Department]] (later [[Royal Army Service Corps]]), [[British Army]] during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] when  he was awarded the VC for his actions on 22 January 1879, at [[Rorke's Drift]], [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]], [[South Africa]]. 

His citation in the ''London Gazette'' of 17 November 1879 reads:
{{quote|For his conspicuous gallantry during the attack on Rorke's Drift post by the Zulus on the night of the 22nd&amp;nbsp;January 1879, when he actively superintended the work of the defence, and was amongst the foremost of those who received the first attack at the corner of the hospital, where the deadliness of his fire did great execution, and the mad rush of the Zulus met with its first check, and where, by his cool courage, he saved the life of a man of the Army Hospital Corps, by shooting the Zulu who having seized the muzzle of the man's rifle, was in the act of assegaing (thrusting an assegai into) him. This officer, to whose energy much of the defence of the place was due, was severely wounded during the contest, but still continued to give the same example of cool courage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mod.uk/logistic/23573.aspx The Royal Logistic Corps - history and Honours]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24784|page=6494|date=18 November 1879}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dalton was not originally named among the VC recipients, eventually receiving his VC from General [[Henry Hugh Clifford|Hugh Clifford, VC]] at a special parade at Fort Napier on 16 January 1880.

==Death and legacy==
Dalton died in [[Port Elizabeth]], South Africa. He is buried in the Russell Road Roman Catholic Cemetery with a memorial, Plot E. The precise location of his grave is 33° 57' 37" S 25° 36' 53" E.

The barracks in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, is named "The Dalton VC Centre" after him. [[Dalton Barracks]], Abingdon, previously RAF Abingdon, also bears his name.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the [[Royal Logistic Corps Museum]] in [[Camberley]], [[Surrey]].

'''Jeremy James Anthony Gibson-Beadle''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (12 April 1948&amp;nbsp;– 30 January 2008) was an English television presenter, radio presenter, writer and producer. During the 1980s he was a regular face on British television, and in two years appeared on 50&amp;nbsp;weeks of the year. He also worked presenting many corporate events.&lt;ref&gt;The Unforgettable Jeremy Beadle, ITV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Beadle was born in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], East London, on 12 April 1948. His father, a Fleet Street sports reporter, abandoned Jeremy's mother, Marji (9 July 1921 – 9 July 2002), when he learned that she was pregnant. Before Jeremy reached the age of two he was frequently hospitalised and had undergone surgery for [[Poland syndrome]], a rare disorder that stunted growth in his right hand.&lt;ref name=inde&gt;James Macintyre, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/jeremy-beadle-king-of-the-tv-practical-jokers-dies-aged-59-776160.html "Jeremy Beadle, king of the TV practical jokers, dies aged 59"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 31 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother worked as a secretary to help pay to raise him, including a stint for the boxing promoter Jack Solomon. Beadle did not enjoy school and was frequently in trouble. He was eventually expelled from his secondary school, Orpington County Secondary Boys' School.&lt;ref name=inde/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianObit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,2249518,00.html|title=Obituary: Jeremy Beadle|first=Dennis|last=Barker|date=31 January 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=31 January 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A teacher remarked, "Beadle, you waffle like a champion but know nothing."

After his expulsion, he travelled and worked in Europe. He had a number of jobs, at one point taking photographs of topless models,&lt;ref name=inde/&gt; and worked as a skin-diving instructor, lavatory attendant and tour guide. He even briefly worked as a tour guide at the York dungeons.&lt;ref name="Watch Out My Autobiography"&gt;''Watch Out My Autobiography''&lt;/ref&gt; He often said that he gave the best London tour because he realised that what people wanted was stories of blood, sex and death.&lt;ref name="Watch Out My Autobiography"/&gt;

Beadle was chosen in 1970 by [[Tony Elliott (publisher)|Tony Elliott]], the founder of ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'', to set up a Manchester edition of the magazine, a venture that was short-lived,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Elliott [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/feb/01/television.relationships "'I think he'd rather not have been a clown'",] ''The Guardian'', 1 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; though he subsequently maintained a connection with the publication in London. In 1972, North West Arts Association asked him to organise the [[Bickershaw Festival]],&lt;ref name=inde/&gt; and he worked on further musical events over the next couple of years.

In 1973, as an early member of the [[Campaign for Real Ale]], he was elected to their National Executive and secured the campaign's first television or radio coverage in a one-hour programme on [[BBC London 94.9|BBC Radio London]], which he hosted.&lt;ref&gt;"What's Brewing", March 2008 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this period that his talent for practical jokes became evident, although occasionally this rebounded on him, such as when colleagues left him naked in front of 400 women arriving for their shift.&lt;ref name=GuardianObit /&gt; He then started writing for radio and television, going on to provide material for stars such as [[Terry Wogan]], [[Michael Aspel]], [[Noel Edmonds]] and [[Kenny Everett]].&lt;ref name=inde/&gt;

==Later public life==

===Radio and television===
Beadle began supplying odd facts and questions to radio and television game shows, such as ''[[Celebrity Squares]]''. He sent a number of questions to [[Bob Monkhouse]], the host, without the answers and Monkhouse was so impressed he rang Jeremy to ask him to work on the show. His presenting style on the phone-in programme ''Nightline'' on [[LBC]] in London, which he hosted between September 1979 and 22 June 1980 (when he was sacked), led to a cult following. He introduced himself as Jeremy James Anthony Gibson-Beadlebum: "Jeremy James Anthony Gibson-Beadle is my name and a bum is what I am," he explained. He teased his producer as 'Butch' Bavin Cook (b. 12 June).

On 31 May 1980, he began co-presenting the children's television show ''Fun Factory'' with his LBC co-star Therese Birch, Kevin Day and [[Billy Boyle]]. On [[Capital Radio]] Beadle presented ''Beadle's Odditarium'', a music show concentrating on strange, bizarre and rare recordings all taken from the archives of producer [[Phil Swern]]. From 5 October 1986, Beadle presented ''Beadle's Brainbusters'' on the independent local radio network, with questions written by Beadle and Paul Donnelley. He also became renowned for his off-air pranks and intellectually challenging quizzes. He wrote, devised and presented many television pilots for the highly successful game show company Action Time, then run by Jeremy Fox, son of [[Paul Fox (television executive)|Paul Fox]]. Beadle wrote and presented ''The Deceivers'', a [[BBC Two|BBC2]] television series recounting the history of swindlers and hoaxers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Hodgson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/31/itv.television |title=Veteran TV joker Jeremy Beadle dies of pneumonia, aged 59  |date=31 January 2008 |registration=yes|work=Guardian media section|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=31 January 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of this led to using the same format for ''[[Eureka (BBC TV Series)|Eureka]]'', which told the background behind everyday inventions.

Beadle then went on to become nationally famous as one of the presenters of [[LWT]]'s ''[[Game for a Laugh]]'', the first show made by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] to beat the BBC's shows in the Saturday night ratings battle. This was followed by a hidden-camera style practical joke show, ''[[Beadle's About]]'' (1986–1996), which became the world's longest continuously running hidden-camera show.

From 1990 to 1997, Beadle presented ''[[You've Been Framed!]]'', a family show featuring humorous clips from viewers' home video recordings. An offshoot of this was ''Beadle's Hotshots'', featuring viewers' intentionally funny parodies and sketches, some of which were re-edited and even reshot by a young [[Edgar Wright]] in his first industry job; other sketches and scripts were produced by writer/director [[Chris Barfoot]]). In total, Beadle hit the UK Number One ratings slot four times.

In 1995, reflecting his days on LBC, he presented a relatively short-lived but popular Sunday late-evening show on the newly launched [[talkSPORT|Talk Radio UK]]. As well as his considerable television output as writer, presenter and producer, he appeared in numerous pantomimes and acted as ringmaster for many circuses, notably for [[Gerry Cottle]]'s. He also worked as a consultant for many television companies, wrote books, and presented quizzes both commercially and for charity. As a radio presenter, he chaired a brief revival of ''Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?'' on [[BBC Radio 4]]. In 2007 he started to work on the Bickershaw Festival 40th Anniversary Boxed set project for 2012 in conjunction with Chris Hewitt, who had worked with Beadle on the original event in 1972. (Chris Hewitt continued to work on the project after Beadle died.)

Beadle was living in [[Highgate]], north London, when he was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' on 26 January 1994. He was surprised by [[Michael Aspel]] during a school carol concert at a church in nearby [[Hampstead]] on 8 December 1993.

===Writing===
Beadle wanted to be the British [[Robert L. Ripley]]. A love of trivia was born when his mother bought him ''[[The Guinness Book of Records]]'' for Christmas when he was a small boy. This led him to write ''Today's the Day'' (published in UK by WH Allen in 1979 and by Signet in the United States two years later), researched in his own library of 27,000 volumes. The book recounts&amp;nbsp;–  for any given day of the year&amp;nbsp;– around half a dozen notable births, deaths or events that occurred on that date, linked to odd or amusing facts. Beadle briefly performed a similar duty on television's ''[[TV-am]]'', informing each morning's viewers of prominent events on this date in past years. The scripts were written by Beadle and Paul Donnelley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pauldonnelley.com/page2.htm|title=PaulDonnelley.com - Biography|website=www.pauldonnelley.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The format was briefly revived when [[GMTV]] replaced TV-am as the ITV breakfast franchise in 1993.

For more than two years Beadle wrote a daily cartoon series of ''Today's the Day'' for the ''[[Daily Express]]''. He worked alongside [[Irving Wallace]] and his son [[David Wallechinsky]] and daughter [[Amy Wallace]] as the biggest contributor to the sex and death chapters of ''[[The Book of Lists]]'' and was the London editor of ''The People's Almanac 2''. The Wallaces' book ''The Intimate Sex Lives of Famous People'' (Dell (US) Hutchinson (UK), 1981) was researched in part in Beadle's library, which contained an extensive collection of erotic literature.

In autumn 2007, three new books by Beadle were published: ''Firsts, Lasts &amp; Onlys: Crime'', ''Firsts, Lasts &amp; Onlys: Military'' (both co-authored by the celebrated writer Ian Harrison) and ''Beadle's Miscellany'', the first hundred quizzes from his weekly puzzlers in ''[[The Independent]]''. He guest-edited the January 2008 edition of ''True Detective'', which featured contributions from his friends who are crime experts including James Morton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littlebrown.co.uk/Genre/Crime-Thriller/TrueCrime?Sort=Author&amp;Page=4|title=Invalid Site|website=www.littlebrown.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Donnelley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pauldonnelley.com|title=PaulDonnelley.com - Home|website=www.pauldonnelley.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Rose and Matthew Spicer.

In 1995, Beadle wrote the foreword to "Who Was Jack the Ripper?", a collection of theories and observations about the Victorian serial murderer, published by the veteran true crime book dealer Camille Woolf. It included contributions from experts such as [[Martin Fido]], [[Colin Wilson]], [[Donald Rumbelow]], Colin Kendell and Richard Whittington-Egan. In his foreword Beadle coined the collective noun to describe those interested in the subject "a speculation of Ripperologists".

===General knowledge===
Renowned for his [[Trivia|general knowledge]], Beadle was host of ''Win Beadle's Money'' (based on the US format ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]''). Beadle lost his money only eight times in 52 shows. He wrote and presented a notoriously difficult quiz at London's The Atlantic Grill restaurant then owned by [[Oliver Peyton]], often attended by celebrities and members of the press. He also wrote a [[quiz]] for ''[[The Independent]]'' every Saturday. He occasionally appeared as a panellist on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Quote... Unquote]]'' and in dictionary corner for [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]''.

Beadle was also a winner on the game show [[19 Keys]], presented by [[Richard Bacon (broadcaster)|Richard Bacon]], defeating [[Nick Weir]], [[Nicholas Parsons]], and fellow [[Game for a Laugh]] presenter [[Henry Kelly]] (who also did [[Going for Gold]]).

===Charity work===
An estimate of Beadle's total charitable fund raising is around £100&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=bbcannounce&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7217342.stm |title=TV presenter Beadle dies aged 59 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=30 January 2008 |accessdate=30 January 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2001 [[New Year Honours]] Beadle was made a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) for his services to charity.&lt;ref name=mbe&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=56070 |supp=y |page=14 |date=30 December 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a keen supporter of the charity [[Children With Leukaemia]], a disease he suffered from himself in 2005. He spent much time raising money for many different charities with Plastermind his 'outrageous quiz for those who don't like quizzes', as well as a school video venture called CamClass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2002/nov/16/schools.education1
|title=Now Beadle's about helping good causes |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=10 May 2009 | location=London | date=16 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beadle was a patron of The [[Philip Green Memorial Trust]], and he annually hosted a quiz party to raise money for disadvantaged children. Beadle was also the patron of Reach, an organisation providing support and advice for children in the UK with hand or arm deficiencies, and their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Who's Who in Reach |url=http://www.reach.org.uk/content/about/whoswho/jeremybeadle.htm |accessdate = 11 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070128074912/http://www.reach.org.uk/content/about/whoswho/jeremybeadle.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 28 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of Westminster City Council Freemason Lodge No. 2882. Although he did not join this organisation until after his television heyday was over, he quickly became involved with all aspects of English [[Freemasonry]], and particularly its charitable work, often using his celebrity status to assist in raising funds for Masonic charities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cumbwestmasons.co.uk/main/famous_british_masons.shtml See this website] for citation.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and disability===
Beadle had [[Poland syndrome]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burt |first=Jennifer |title=Jeremy was a role model for children |publisher=Leicester (UK) Mercury |date=20 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; which manifested itself as a disproportionately small right hand.&lt;ref name="bbcobit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7217383.stm |title=Obituary: Jeremy Beadle |work=BBC News |date=30 January 2008 |accessdate=30 January 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Beadle was diagnosed with [[Renal cell carcinoma|cancer of the kidney]] and underwent a successful operation to remove it.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} In April 2005, a blood test during a routine post-op medical check-up led to his being diagnosed with [[Chronic lymphocytic leukemia|CLL]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/%27Jeremy+Beadle%27s+death+frightened+my+family%27.-a0175551342 "'Jeremy Beadle’s death frightened my family'",] ''The Free Library'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Beadle was successfully treated for this, though two serious illnesses in such a short space of time were detrimental to his general state of health.

==Death==
[[Image:Jeremy Beadle grave.jpg|thumb|right|Grave, [[Highgate Cemetery]]]]
On 25 January 2008, it was reported that Beadle had been admitted to The London Clinic and was subsequently placed in a critical care unit due to severe [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Reynolds |url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/32669/TV-s-Jeremy-Beadle-seriously-ill-as-he-fights-pneumonia/ |title=Tv's Jeremy Beadle seriously ill as he fights pneumonia |work=Daily Express |date=25 January 2008 |accessdate=30 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/showbiz/2008/01/25/jeremy-beadle-has-pneumonia-89520-20297026/ |title=Jeremy Beadle has pneumonia |work=Daily Mirror |date=25 January 2008 |accessdate=30 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 30 January 2008, at the age of 59.&lt;ref name=bbcannounce /&gt; On 2 February 2008 ITV dedicated that day's episode of ''You've Been Framed'' to Beadle and promoted a tribute webpage to him over the show's credits. The channel's official tribute to Jeremy Beadle was broadcast on 4 February 2008 where various celebrity friends including [[Alan Sugar|Lord Sugar]] paid tribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.itv.com/Entertainment/celebrity/JeremyBeadledies/default.html |title=Jeremy Beadle dies |work=ITV plc |date=30 January 2008 |accessdate=9 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beadle was cremated at [[East Finchley Cemetery|Marylebone Crematorium]] on 14 February 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/2008/02/15/jeremy-beadle-has-last-laugh-at-his-funeral-86908-20319989/|title=Jeremy Beadle Has Last Laugh at His Funeral&amp;nbsp;– The Daily Record |publisher=www.dailyrecord.co.uk |accessdate=27 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and interred in [[Highgate Cemetery]] (his headstone bears the inscription "Writer, Presenter, Curator of Oddities"). A further tribute was aired on Friday 16 May, ''[[An Audience with...|An Audience Without Jeremy Beadle]]'', hosted by [[Chris Tarrant]] and with contributions from [[Alan Sugar]], [[Henry Kelly]], [[Ken Campbell]], [[Anneka Rice]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Beadle's obituary in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' claimed that he "was the most avidly watched presenter on television".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1576975/Jeremy-Beadle.html  Obituary,] ''Daily Telegraph'', 30 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August 2010 he was the subject of an ITV documentary, ''The Unforgettable Jeremy Beadle''.

'''John IV of Glymes, 2nd Marquess of Berghes''' (1528–1567), [[Grand Huntsman of Brabant]], was a noble from the Low Countries.
[[File:Emanuel van Meteren Historie ppn 051504510 MG 8684 johan van berghen.tif|thumb|John IV of Glymes]]

He was the son of [[Anthony of Glymes]] (1500–1541) and Jacqueline de Croÿ, sister of [[Philippe II de Croÿ]]. He succeeded his father as [[Lords and margraves of Bergen op Zoom|Lord of Bergen op Zoom]] in 1541 under regency of his mother.

As his ancestors, John IV was an important political figure of his time. In 1550, he married Maria of Lannoy, daughter of Jan van Lannoy, a Knight in the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]]. They had no surviving children. In 1554 he was sent to England, together with [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont]], to arrange the marriage between [[Philip II of Spain]] and [[Mary I of England]].&lt;br&gt;
He participated in the War against France and was rewarded with the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] in 1556. Four years later, he was appointed [[Stadtholder]] of [[County of Hainaut|Hainault]]. He was also a member of the Council of state.

When the tensions between King Philip II, represented by his minister [[Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle]], and the nobility of the Low Countries increased, he subscribed in 1565 the [[Compromise of Nobles]], which was ignored by King Philip.&lt;br&gt;
As a protested, Glymes resigned as Stadtholder in January 1566, together with [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], [[Floris of Montmorency]], [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont]] and [[Philip de Montmorency, Count of Horn]].
 
In April 1566, he was sent with [[Floris of Montmorency]] to Spain in a last attempt to avoid war. He was wounded on the leg before leaving, when he was hit by a wooden ball whilst passing a ballgame, and died from complications in Segovia on May 23, 1567. By then, the [[Beeldenstorm]] had already raged across the Low Countries and the Duke of Alba was on his way to the Low Countries to "restore the order".

'''Julius Koch''' (1872 – 30 March 1902), also known as ''Le Geant Constantin'', was one of seventeen people in medical history who have surpassed eight feet (244&amp;nbsp;cm) in height. He was a victim of the malady eunuchoidal-infantile [[gigantism]] (daddy-longlegs syndrome). His height, 245.9 centimeters, (8 feet, 0.8 inches) was estimated, as his legs were amputated after they developed [[gangrene]]. He was probably never the world's tallest person due to his life coinciding with that of [[John Rogan]], who likewise suffered from gigantism. Koch's [[femur]]s were the longest on record - 76 centimeters (29.9 inches) - and his hands were 37.5 centimeters (14¾ inches) in length. His feet in some articles are claimed to have a length of 32 inches (81.3&amp;nbsp;cm).

Koch died in [[Mons]], [[Belgium]] on 30 March 1902. His skeleton is preserved in the Museum of Natural History in Mons, Belgium.

Koch was the star of an early short film, ''The Giant Constantin'', released in 1902.

==Early life==
[[Plutarch]] indicates his real name was Sphínēs and that he was from [[Taxila]], but since he greeted people with the word "Kalē!" - perhaps ''kallāṇa (mitta)'' "Greetings (friend)" - the Greeks called him Kalanos.&lt;ref name=Halkias /&gt;&lt;ref name=invasion&gt;{{cite book |last=M'Crindle |first=J.W. |title=The invasion of India by Alexander the Great |year=2004 |publisher=Kessinger Pub. |location=[[Whitefish, Montana]] |isbn=9780766189201 |pages=46, 315, 388–9, 346 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncDFRgtSysIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sastri/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Enemies of the Roman order: treason, unrest, and alienation in the empire  By Ramsay MacMullen |year=1992 |page=317 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a4YOAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite book |title=Yādnāmah-ʾi Panjumīn Kungrih-ʾi Bayn al-Milalī-i Bāstānshināsī va Hunar-i Īrān |year=1972 |publisher=Ministry of Culture and Arts, Iran.

Early Western scholarship suggested Kalanos was a Jain, but modern scholarship rejects this notion as Jain ascetics are forbidden from using fire and deliberate self-harm due to their convictions about [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]] and because Taxila and Gandhara were centers of Buddhism and had no Jain presence at all.&lt;ref name=Halkias /&gt;

== Meeting Alexander ==
Plutarch records that when first invited to meet Alexander, Kalanos "roughly commanded him to strip himself and hear what he said naked, otherwise he would not speak a word to him, though he came from [[Jupiter]] himself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Plutarch |title=The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdH27ZmvD5cC |year=1998 |publisher=The Modern Library (Random House Inc) |location=New York |isbn=9781853267949 |page=847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalanos refused the rich gifts offered by Alexander saying that man's desire cannot be satisfied by such gifts.&lt;ref name=suhas/&gt; They believed that, even if Alexander killed them, "they would be delivered from the body of flesh now afflicted with age and would be translated to a better and purer life."&lt;ref name=suhas/&gt; Alexander's representative [[Onesicritus]]&lt;ref name=jackson&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams Jackson |first=A.V. |title=History of India Vol. IX |year=2009 |publisher=Cosimo Inc. |location=New York |isbn=9781605205328 |pages=65–70 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lllGG9RtILQC}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a discussion with several sages and Alexander was attracted by the criticism on Greek Philosophy by Kalanos.&lt;ref name=sastri/&gt; Alexander persuaded Kalanos to accompany him to Persis&lt;ref name=invasion/&gt; and stay with him as one of his teachers. Alexander even hinted use of force to take him to his country, to which Kalanos replied philosophically, that "what shall I be worth to you, Alexander, for exhibiting to the Greeks if I am compelled to do what I do not wish to do?"&lt;ref name=Maren/&gt; Kalanos lived as a teacher to Alexander and represented "eastern honesty and freedom".&lt;ref name=Maren&gt;{{cite book |last=Niehoff |first=Maren R. |title=Philo on Jewish identity and culture |year=2001 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |location=Tübingen |isbn=9783161476112 |pages=153–154 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cOjCkfLCt3sC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and prophecy==

==Early life==

Pugliese was born and raised in Ottawa Ontario, but frequently visited Pikwàkanagàn in her youth. Most of her close family lived off-reserve in Ottawa.&lt;ref&gt;See intro and conclusion in Karyn Pugliese "'So, where are you from?' glimpsing the history of Ottawa-Gatineau's urban Indian communities M.A. Thesis Carleton University, 2005 https://curve.carleton.ca/94ac5233-7a31-4bc8-bd8f-012d9b6429a9&lt;/ref&gt;

Pugliese dropped out of high school three times, eventually enrolling in an alternative high school where she earned her diploma.  Although she was a bright student, Pugliese had no intention of attending university, and wanted to be a bartender, until a high school teacher coaxed her into applying to [[Carleton University|Carleton University's]] journalism program.  She enrolled and graduated with a combined honours in Journalism and History in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;In Department of History Newsletter WINTER 2007 https://carleton.ca/history/wp-content/uploads/Newsletter-Winter-2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating Pugliese worked short-term contracts at [[CBC Radio]] Ottawa’s ''Morning Show'', ''Sounds Like Canada'' and CTV television, Ottawa. As a single mother of a young child, Pugliese found it difficult to balance motherhood with the instability of a journalism career. For a time she left journalism and worked as a technical writer in the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Jermyn "How top employers empower their people" Oct. 10, Globe and Mail  2012 12:29PM EDT https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/top-employers/how-top-employers-empower-their-people/article4598515/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karyn Pugliese Linkin Profile https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAIAAAB6cbcBxBdKQLjhK3ApUNhqYOVDXw2mgSg&amp;trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile_pic&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time she returned to Carleton University to complete an M.A. in History. Her thesis  '''So, where are you from?' Glimpsing the history of Ottawa-Gatineau's urban Indian communities'' is a history of the off-reserve community she grew up in.&lt;ref&gt;In Department of History Newsletter WINTER 2007 https://carleton.ca/history/wp-content/uploads/Newsletter-Winter-2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Pugliese returned to journalism in 2000, after a professor put her in touch with the [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network|APTN]]. Pugliese became the APTN’s first Parliamentary Correspondent. She credits the APTN’s daycare policy and flexible hours for her ability to re-enter journalism and build a career.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Jermyn "How top employers empower their people" The Globe and Mail Oct. 10, 2012 https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/top-employers/how-top-employers-empower-their-people/article4598515/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kilab ibn Murrah''' ({{lang-ar|كلاب بن مُرة}}) (born 373 AD) was an ancestor of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad|Muḥammad]].&lt;ref name="IbnHisham"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ibn Hisham|first= |title=The Life of the Prophet Muhammad|year= |volume=1|publisher= |page=181|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Kilab was the son of [[Murrah ibn Ka'b]] ibn Lu'ay ibn Ghalib ibn Fihr ibn Malik by his first wife Hind bint Surayr ibn Thalabah ibn Harith ibn Fihr ibn Malik. Both his parents traced their lineage back to Fihr, the progenitor of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]], and further to [[Ishmael#Islamic view|Ismail]] ([[Ishmael]]), son of [[Islamic view of Abraham|Ibrahim]] ([[Abraham]]).

He had two half-brothers, [[Taym ibn Murrah]] and Yaqazah ibn Murrah, through his father's second wife, Asma bint Adiy (Hind bint Harithah al-Bariqiyyah) of Asad.&lt;ref name="ruqaiyyah2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Maqsood|first=Ruqaiyyah Waris|url=http://www.ruqaiyyah.karoo.net/articles/prophfamily2.htm|title=The Prophet’s Family Line No 2  - from Qusayy to Adnan and beyond|publisher=Ruqaiyyah Waris Maqsood Dawah|date=|accessdate=14 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925104139/http://www.ruqaiyyah.karoo.net/articles/prophfamily2.htm|archivedate=25 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married to [[Fatimah bint Sa'd|Fatimah bint Sa'd ibn Sayl]], who bore him two sons. His elder son, [[Zuhrah ibn Kilab]], was the progenitor of the [[Banu Zuhrah]] clan, and his younger son, [[Qusai ibn Kilab]], became the first [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] custodian of the [[Kaaba|Ka'aba]]. After his death, his wife married Rabi'ah ibn Haram from the [[Banu Udhrah]] tribe.

'''Krafft Arnold Ehricke''' (March 24, 1917&amp;nbsp;– December 11, 1984) was a German [[rocket]]-propulsion engineer and advocate for [[space colonization]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Berlin]], Ehricke believed in the feasibility of space travel from a very young age, influenced by his viewing of the [[Fritz Lang]] film ''[[Woman in the Moon]]''. At the age of 12, he formed his own rocket society.  He attended [[Technical University of Berlin]] and studied [[celestial mechanics]] and nuclear [[physics]] under such luminaries as [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]], attaining his degree in [[Aerospace engineering|Aeronautical Engineering]].&lt;ref name="astronautix1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/ehricke.htm |title=Ehricke |publisher=Astronautix.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019013520/http://astronautix.com/astros/ehricke.htm |archivedate=2010-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked at [[Peenemünde]] as a propulsion engineer from 1942 to 1945 with [[Walter Thiel]], then went to the United States with other German rocket scientists and technicians under "[[Operation Paperclip]]" in 1947. He worked for a short time with the Von Braun Rocket Team at [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]].

In 1948, while working for the U.S. Army, Ehricke wrote a story about a manned mission to Mars called "Expedition Ares".  It anticipated the many challenges that still face explorers who will make the journey in the future. In the same year he wrote a book with [[Wernher von Braun]], ''[[The Mars Project]]'', which detailed how man could travel to [[Mars]] using a ferry system.

Upon leaving government service Ehricke worked at [[Bell Aircraft]], and then for [[Convair]] in 1952. While at Convair, he designed the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|D-1 Centaur]], the world's first upper-stage-booster that used liquid hydrogen and oxygen.&lt;ref name="astronautix1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/Ehricke.html |title=Ehricke, Krafft Arnold (1917-1984) |publisher=Daviddarling.info |date=2007-02-01 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also created an early space station design, based on launch by Convair's Atlas rocket. The [[NEXUS (rocket)|NEXUS]] reusable rocket was a 1960s concept design by a group at [[General Dynamics]] led by Krafft Ehricke. Also, during his stay at General Dynamics, he participated on [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)]].

In 1966, Ehricke was inducted into the International Aerospace Hall of Fame for his engineering achievements and his influential ideas on the purpose of space exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. ''These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame''. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-57864-397-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Krafft Ehricke undertook a major, multi-decade study of the industrial development of the Moon, which he described as Earth's "seventh continent." His lunar industrialization concept was based on the most advanced technologies, such as nuclear-powered freight transporters, and using [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] energy to power his city, Selenopolis, on the Moon.

Ehricke received a [[space burial]] on April 21, 1997, when a rocket sent a small amount of his cremated remains into Earth orbit.

He married Ingeborg Ehricke (born 12 September 1922).&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|1039922|section=bio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to space flight dynamics==
Ehricke was an accomplished practitioner in the field of astrodynamics and its applications.  His two-volume work entitled Space Flight is probably the most complete and surely the most useful introduction to this complex subject ever written.  It focuses on methods for exploration of the solar system.  He clearly demonstrated the so-called "gravity assist" method for utilizing hyperbolic encounters with an intermediate planet to increase (or decrease) the velocity and orbital elements of a space vehicle.  This technique had opened the entire solar system to robotic exploration by using what he called "Instrumented Comets."  Examples include the Voyager missions to the outer planets and the recent successful New Horizons mission to Pluto. His contribution to this important field of exploration has been neglected for many decades and incorrect claims of "invention" of what is now called gravity assist were made by Minovitch.

==Extraterrestrial Imperative==
Ehricke promoted a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] concept called the "Extraterrestrial Imperative." This idea refers to Ehricke's belief that it was the responsibility of humanity to explore space and exploit the resources of the [[Solar System]], in order to sustain the development of the species. There are no external "limits to growth," Ehricke insisted, because while the Earth is a "closed system," the exploration of space opens the universe to humanity.  For Ehricke, human creativity has no limits.&lt;ref&gt;Ehricke, Krafft, [http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1978/jan-feb/ehricke.html "The Extraterrestrial Imperative,"] ''Air University Review'', January–February 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apogeespacebooks.com/Books/9781894959919.html |title=Krafft Ehricke Extraterrestrial Imperative by Marsha Freeman An Apogee Books Publication |publisher=Apogeespacebooks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Japanese name|Kōtoku}}
{{nihongo|'''Denjirō Kōtoku'''|幸徳 傳次郎|Kōtoku Denjirō|November 5, 1871 – January 24, 1911}}, better known by the ''[[nom de plume]]'' {{nihongo|'''Kōtoku Shūsui '''|幸徳 秋水|}}, was a Japanese [[socialism|socialist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] who played a leading role in [[Anarchism in Japan|introducing anarchism to Japan]] in the early 20th century, particularly by translating the works of contemporary European and Russian anarchists, such as [[Peter Kropotkin]], into [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. He was a radical [[journalism|journalist]], and he was executed for [[treason]] by the Japanese government.

He also contributed articles to ''Sekai Fujin'' (''Women of the World''), a socialist women's newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;''Japan and the High Treason Incident'', edited by Masako Gavin, Ben Middleton November 1890 Page 110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Socialist years and imprisonment===
Kōtoku moved from his birthplace, the town of [[Nakamura, Kōchi|Nakamura]] in [[Kōchi Prefecture]], to [[Tokyo]] in his mid-teens and after graduating from the Tokyo School of English, became a journalist there in 1893. He joined [[Katayama Sen]] in the "Society of the Study of Socialism". From 1898 onwards he was a columnist for the ''Yorozu Chōhō (Everything Morning News)'', one of the more radical daily papers of the time; however, he resigned that position when the paper switched to a pro-war stance in October 1903 in the buildup to the [[Russo-Japanese War]].

The following month he co-founded the ''[[Heimin Shimbun]]'' (''Common Peoples' Newspaper'') with another ''Yorozu Chōhō'' journalist, [[Toshihiko Sakai]]. This paper's outspoken anti-war stance and disregard of the state's press laws landed its editors in trouble with the government on numerous occasions, and Kōtoku himself served a five-month jail sentence from February to July 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Notehelfer| first = Frederick George| year = 1971| title = Kōtoku Shūsui: Portrait of a Japanese Radical| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]| location = Cambridge| edition =| series =| volume =| chapter = Chapter 4: Pacifist opposition to the Russo-Japanese War, 1903–5| pages = 106–107| isbn = 978-0-521-07989-1| oclc = 142930| url = https://books.google.com/?id=qa88AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA106| lccn = 76134620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===America and the anarchist influence===
In 1901, when Kōtoku together with Katayama, Sakai and [[Abe Isoo]] took part in the first attempt to found the [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Japanese Social Democratic Party]], he was not an anarchist, but a socialist&amp;nbsp;– Sakai and Kōtoku were the first to translate ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' into Japanese, which appeared in an issue of the ''Heimin Shimbun'' and which got them heavily fined.

His political thoughts first began to turn to a more [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] philosophy when he read Kropotkin's ''[[Fields, Factories and Workshops]]'' in prison. In his own words, he "had gone [to jail] as a Marxian Socialist and returned as a radical Anarchist."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/japan/sp001883/japchap1.html The Anarchist Movement in Japan – Chapter One: 1906–1911&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.spunk.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Common Peoples Newspaper.JPG|thumb|A clip from the ''Heimin Shimbun'' (13 November 1904)]]

In November 1905 Kōtoku travelled to the United States in order to freely criticise the [[Emperor of Japan]], whom he now saw as the linchpin of [[capitalism]] in Japan. During his time in the United States, Kōtoku was further exposed to the philosophies of [[anarchist communism]] and European [[syndicalism]].

He had taken Kropotkin's ''Memoirs of a Revolutionist'' as reading material for the [[Pacific]] voyage; after he arrived in [[California]], he began to correspond with Kropotkin and by 1909 had translated ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' from English to Japanese.

One thousand copies of his translation were published in Japan in March of that year and distributed to students and workers.

===Return to Japan===
On Kōtoku's return to Japan, in June 1906, a public meeting was held to welcome him. At this meeting, on June 28, he spoke on "The Tide of the World Revolutionary Movement", which he said was flowing against parliamentary politics (i.e. Marxist party politics) and in favour of the [[general strike]] as "the means for the future revolution".

This was an [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] view, and one which, because anarcho-syndicalism was growing in the United States at the time, with the founding of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], showed the American influence clearly.

He followed this speech with a number of articles, the most well-known of which was "The Change in My Thought (On Universal Suffrage)".
In these articles, Kōtoku was now advocating [[direct action]] rather than political aims such as [[universal suffrage]], which was a shock to many of his comrades and brought the schism between Anarchist Communists and Social Democrats to the Japanese working class movement.

This split was made clear when the re-launched ''[[Heimin Shimbun]]'' folded in April 1907 and was replaced two months later by two journals: the Social Democrat ''Social News'' and the ''Osaka Common People's Newspaper'', which argued from an anarchist position, in favour of [[direct action]].

===Trial and execution===
{{Communism sidebar}}
Although there were anarchists who preferred peaceful means, such as the dissemination of [[propaganda]], many anarchists in this period turned to [[terrorism]] as means of overthrowing the state and achieving Anarchist Communism, or at least hitting out against the state and authority. Repression of publications and organizations, such as the [[Socialist Party of Japan]], and "public peace police law", which effectively prevented [[trade union]] organizations and strikes, were both factors in this emerging trend in Japan.

In the episode which became known as the [[High Treason Incident]] (''Taigyaku Jiken''), police arrested five anarchists for possessing bomb-making equipment, which was allegedly intended for a plot to [[assassination|assassinate]] [[Emperor Meiji]].

This was followed by a wave of arrests of political dissidents, including Kōtoku. Though there was conclusive evidence against five, on January 18, 1911, twenty-six anarchists were convicted&amp;nbsp;– mostly on [[circumstantial evidence]]. Twenty-four were sentenced to death, and twelve were actually executed&amp;nbsp;– Kōtoku among them. While he may have known of the plot to kill the Emperor in its initial stages, he had certainly distanced himself from it.&lt;ref&gt;See Sharon Sievers, (1983), Flowers in salt: The beginnings of feminist consciousness in modern Japan, Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Kōtoku was hanged along with ten others on January 24, 1911 (the one woman, [[Suga Kanno]], was executed the following day because it was already turning dark).

In 1965 the Japanese Supreme Court refused a plea to reopen his case and that of the others executed with him.

===Christ myth theory===
His final work is ''Kirisuto Massatsuron'' (基督抹殺論, On the Obliteration of Christ). In this book, he claimed that Jesus was a mythical and unreal figure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwanami.co.jp/.BOOKS/33/4/3312550.html 基督抹殺論]([[Iwanami Shoten, Publishers]] website, Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/japanesethoughti012224mbp/japanesethoughti012224mbp_djvu.txt Full text of "Japanese Thought In The Meiji Era Centenary Culture Council Series"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leila Djabali''' (born 1933) was an [[Algeria]]n intellectual and poet, who was imprisoned and tortured by the French colonial authorities during the [[Algerian War of Independence]].

Her poem, ''Pour mon tortionnaire, le Lieutenant D..'' (''For My Torturer, Lieutenant D...'', 1957), written while imprisoned at the Barberousse Prison in [[Algiers]], vividly portrays multiple rapes in prison, and ends by describing the gentle everyday life of the torturer.&lt;ref&gt;Gathering Seaweed: African Prison Writing, By Jack Mapanje, Heinemann 2002 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mNNaXZgi0FsC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=djabali+locomotive+belly&amp;sig=ACfU3U1JfMw0Xt_IpUQuE4BK0i5HsG5s0g]&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem has been anthologized in ''Women Poets of the World'' (1983), ''The Heinemann Book of African Women’s Poetry'' (1995), and ''Fire in the Soul: 100 Poems for Human Rights'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/leila-djabali|title=Leila Djabli|publisher=[[Poetry Foundation]] Website|accessdate=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maarten Rudelsheim''' (25 April 1873 in [[Amsterdam]] &amp;ndash; 10 September 1920 in [[Antwerp]]) was a ''[[flamingant]]'' of Jewish-Dutch descent.

Rudelsheim was born in the [[Netherlands]], of a [[Jewish]] father and a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] mother. In 1885, the family came to Antwerp. Maarten Rudelsheim studied at [[Ghent University]] and became [[doctorate|Doctor]] of [[German language|German]] [[philology]]. In 1898, Maarten Rudelsheim was naturalized as a [[Belgian]] citizen. In 1900, he became assistant [[librarian]] in Antwerp. Like [[Louis Franck (politician)|Louis Franck]], [[Nico Gunzburg]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Lon Landau|nl}}, Maarten Rudelsheim was one of a number of Jewish [[flamingant]]s who were engaged in the [[Flemish movement]]. He devoted himself to the Dutchification of [[Ghent University]], then still a French-speaking university in a Flemish city. After the [[World War I|war]], Rudelsheim was condemned to ten years' imprisonment for involvement in [[activism]] during the war. He died in Antwerp prison.

'''Mamai''' ({{lang-tt|Мамай, Mamay}}; 1335–1380), of Kiyat descent, was a powerful military commander of the [[Golden Horde]]. Contrary to popular misconception, he was not a [[Khan (title)|khan]] (king), but a warlord and a [[kingmaker]] for several khans, and the de facto regent of the Horde in the 1370s. His defeat in [[Battle of Kulikovo]] marked the beginning of the decline of the Horde, as well as his own.

==Viceroy of Crimea==
Mamai became governor, sometime in the second half of the 1350s, of a territory that later would become the [[Crimean Khanate]]. During the rule of [[Berdi Beg]] (1357–59) Mamai was appointed as ''beqlar beg'' ([[beylerbey]]), a position simultaneously combining the duties of general of the army, minister of foreign affairs, and the head of the supreme court.

==Interregnum after the assassination of  Berdi Beg==
Upon the assassination of [[Berdi Beg]] by [[Qulpa]] in 1359, Mamai associated himself with one of the coalitions formed to depose Qulpa. During that period of time the [[Golden Horde]] was in relative chaos; numerous regional governors were striving to become the Khan. Qulpa eventually was killed by [[Nawruz Beg]] who was himself assassinated less than six months later. Mamai, who was not a direct descendant of [[Genghis Khan]], played a key role in promoting and supporting rival khans of the [[White Horde]] (western part of Golden Horde). In 1361 he supported Ğabdullah, son of [[Uzbeg Khan]], who became [[Khan (title)|Khan]] in Crimea. Upon the death of Ğabdullah in 1370, Mamai supported Bulak under regency of [[Tulun Beg Khanum]], who only briefly enjoyed power before being replaced by his main opponent [[Urus Khan|Urus]] in 1372.

==Attempts to subdue the Principalities of Rus==

After being badly defeated by Russians under [[Dmitri Donskoi]] first in 1378 at the [[Battle of the Vozha River]] and then at the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] (1380), Mamai began to assemble a large force to punish Dmitri. But he was defeated by [[Tokhtamysh]] on the banks of the [[Kalka River]] and was either executed by Tokhtamysh or assassinated by the Genoese after fleeing to Caffa.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Martin, ''Medieval Russia, 980-1584'', (Cambridge University Press, 1995), 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Mamai paved the way for the next khan to reunify the Golden Horde.

==Legacy==
The memory of Mamai has endured for centuries. Contemporary [[Russian language]] has an expression "как Мамай прошёл" (''kak Mamaj prošjol''), which translates roughly to "it's as if Mamai came through here", used to describe an utter mess.

The burial of Mamai was found by the native Crimean and famous Russian painter [[Ivan Aivazovsky]]. Mamai was buried in a village of ''Şeyh Mamay'' (today Aivazovske, [[Kirovske Raion]]).

== Purported descendants ==
Khan  Mamatsios or Mamatzios, Mamatsou,Mamatsu (Mamai-son) Macedonie was a supposed son of Mamai. One of his sons, Manzur Kiyat, purportedly escaped to [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], and, serving Grand Prince [[Vytautas the Great]], received the title of Prince of [[Hlinsk]] with multiple estates around the modern city of [[Poltava]] ([[Ukraine]]). These legendary events could have taken place in the 15th century, although the first documented mention of the [[Glinski]] princes is made in 1437. [[Michael Glinski]] was the most illustrious member of the family: he studied at the German university, took part as a knight in the [[Italian Wars]], was the most powerful man in Lithuania in the 16th century, but later rebelled and run away with his brothers to [[Muscovy]] and helped the Russians to retake the city of [[Smolensk]]. His niece [[Elena Glinskaya]] was married to [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasily III]], Grand Prince of [[Moscow]], and [[Ivan the Terrible]] was her son.

'''Melchor Aymerich''' (1754 in [[Ceuta]] &amp;ndash; 1836 in [[Cuba]]) was a Spanish general and provincial administrator, serving as the last president of the [[Royal Audience of Quito]] from April until May 1822. One of the last Spanish colonial provinces to be overthrown during the final years of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]], he was defeated by rebel General [[Antonio José de Sucre]] at the [[Battle of Pichincha]] on May 24, 1822, formally surrendering two days later.

'''Mirabeau Buonaparte Lamar''' (August 16, 1798 – December 19, 1859), an attorney born in Georgia, became a [[Texas]] [[politician]], poet, diplomat and soldier. He was a leading Texas political figure during the Texas Republic era. He was elected as the second [[President of the Republic of Texas|President]] of the [[Republic of Texas]] after [[Sam Houston]]. He was known for waging war against the Cherokee and Comanche people to push them out of Texas and for establishing a fund to support public education.

==Early life==
[[File:Coat of Arms of Mirabeau B. Lamar.svg|175px|thumb|left|Coat of Arms of Mirabeau B. Lamar]]
Lamar was born in 1798 in [[Louisville, Georgia]], and grew up at Fairfield, his father's cotton [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] near [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]], then the state capital. His father's family were descended from French Huguenot Thomas Lamar, who had settled in Maryland in 1660, and they had connections throughout Georgia and the South.&lt;ref name="hay"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/40577432?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Thomas Robson Hay, "Gazaway Bugg Lamar, Confederate Banker and Business Man"], ''The Georgia Historical Quarterly'' Vol. 37, No. 2 (June, 1953), pp.&amp;nbsp;89–128, via JSTOR; accessed 31 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tsha"&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fla15  "Mirabeau Buonaparte Lamar"], ''Handbook of Texas History Online''&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Lamar loved to read and educated himself through books. Although he was accepted to [[Princeton University|Princeton College]], he chose not to attend. He started work as a merchant and then ran a newspaper, but both of those enterprises failed.

In 1823, Lamar's family connections helped him to gain a position as the private secretary to newly elected Georgia Governor [[George M. Troup]]. In this position, Lamar issued press releases and toured the state giving speeches on behalf of the governor. On one of his trips, he met Tabitha Burwell Jordan, whom he married in 1826.&lt;ref name=hen35&gt;Hendrickson (1995), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; They had a daughter together.&lt;ref name="tsha"/&gt;

When Troup lost his reelection bid in 1828, Lamar moved with his family to [[Columbus, Georgia]], where he established the ''[[Columbus Ledger-Enquirer|Columbus Enquirer]].''&lt;ref name=cep&gt;[http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/presidents/lamar/m_lamar_jan_1828.html "Prospectus for the Columbus Enquirer, 1828"], Texas State Library, retrieved September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This venture was much more successful than his previous business attempts. In 1830 his wife Tabitha died of [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="archives"&gt;[https://www.tsl.texas.gov/treasures/giants/lamar/lamar-01.html "Mirabeau B. Lamar"], Texas State Library and Archives Commission, accessed 5 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Lamar was deeply affected and took time to recover his drive. He withdrew his name from consideration for re-election to the [[Georgia Senate]], in which he had served one term.

After traveling, Lamar began to study law. He was admitted to the [[Bar (law)|bar]] in 1833 and ran an unsuccessful campaign for a seat in the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]].&lt;ref name=hen35/&gt;

==Texas Revolution==
Lamar's brother [[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar (I)|Lucius]] committed suicide in 1834. A grief-stricken Lamar began traveling again to ease his sorrow. In the summer of 1835, he reached [[Mexican Texas|Texas]], then part of Mexico. He decided to stay, where he was visiting his friend [[James Fannin]]. He had recently settled there and was working as a [[slave trader]] in Velasco.&lt;ref name=hen35/&gt;&lt;ref name="archives"/&gt;

After a trip back to Georgia, Lamar returned to Texas. Learning of a battle for independence, he traveled with his horse and sword to join [[Sam Houston]]'s army in spring 1836, and distinguished himself with bravery at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]].&lt;ref name=hen35/&gt; On the eve of the battle, Lamar courageously rescued two surrounded Texans, an act that drew a salute from the Mexican lines. One of those rescued was [[Thomas Jefferson Rusk]], later appointed as Texas Secretary of War.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lamar Coughlin, ''Those Southern Lamars'' {{ISBN|0-7388-2410-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2018}} Lamar was promoted that night from private to Colonel and given command of the cavalry during the battle the following day.

Houston noted in his battle report: "Our cavalry, sixty-one in number, commanded by Mirabeau B. Lamar, (whose gallant and daring conduct on the previous day, had attracted the admiration of his comrades and called him to that station,) placed on our right, completed our line..."{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

After Texas achieved independence from Mexico, Lamar was appointed as the Secretary of War in the interim [[Republic of Texas|Texian]] government. In 1836, he was elected to the position.

==President of Texas==
Lamar, the unanimous choice as nominee of the [[Democratic Party (Texas)|Democratic Party]] for president to succeed Houston, was elected. He was inaugurated on December 1, 1838.&lt;ref name=hen35 /&gt; Houston talked for three hours in his farewell address, "which so unnerved Lamar that he was unable to read his inaugural speech."&lt;ref name=hen35 /&gt; It was given by his aide, Algernon P. Thompson.&lt;ref name=hen35 /&gt; Lamar's vice president was David G. Burnet.

Several weeks later, in his first formal address to the [[Texas Congress]], Lamar urged that the [[Cherokee]] and [[Comanche]] tribes be driven from their lands in Texas, even if the tribes had to be destroyed. He proposed to create a national bank and to secure a loan from either the [[United States]] or [[Europe]]. Finally, he stated his opposition to potential annexation to the United States and desire to gain recognition of the Republic of Texas by European nations.&lt;ref name=hen37&gt;Hendrickson (1995), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

He ordered attacks against the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribes. In 1839 Texan troops drove the Cherokee bands from the state. Houston's friend, [[The Bowl (Cherokee chief)|Chief Bowles]], was killed in battle, and Houston was furious with Lamar. The government conducted a similar campaign against the Comanche. Although losing many lives, the Comanche resisted leaving the area.&lt;ref name=hen37 /&gt; Lamar believed the "total extinction" of the Indian tribes was necessary to make the lands available to whites.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Gary C. ''The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land 1820–1875'', 2005, pg. 174, {{ISBN|0-8061-3698-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He drove the Indians out at the Battle of the Neches, where 500 Texans attacked 800 American Indians of several different tribes. Of these 800 Indians, between 400–500 were women, children, and elders. The Texans and Rangers that attacked the tribes were fully armed, while the Indians had an estimated 16–24 rifles and pistols. Before the attack, Duwali, Gatunwali, Big Mush, and other chiefs and leaders asked for time to gather their crops, then they would go in peace, but Lamar would not wait. Lamar ordered the Secretary of War, [[Albert Sydney Johnston]], and General Thomas J. Rusk to run them out of Texas. Some say he said: "Just kill them all."{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Lamar appointed a commission to select a permanent site for the capital of the Republic.  After two months of debate, they recommended the small town of Waterloo, along the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] toward the center of the state. The town was renamed [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] after the pioneer. By October 1839, all of the records and employees were relocated there from [[Houston, Texas|Houston]].&lt;ref name=hen37 /&gt; That same year, Lamar founded the Texas State Library (presently known as the [[Texas State Library and Archives Commission]]).&lt;ref name=hen37 /&gt;

During his administration, Lamar sent three separate agents to [[Mexico]] to negotiate a peace settlement. All failed. Lamar failed to gain official recognition for Texas from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], [[France]], and [[Belgium]]; it always eluded the would-be nation. He did succeed in getting the three nations to send observers, who would provisionally investigate the issue.&lt;ref name=hen38&gt;Hendrickson (1995), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not succeed in getting loans approved from them. To fill the treasury, he authorized issuance of a large amount of Republic of Texas paper money, known as [[Texas redbacks|Redbacks]]. The paper money was virtually worthless. Spending doubled during Lamar's term and, combined with the worthless currency, caused financial difficulties for the government.&lt;ref name=hen37 /&gt;&lt;ref name=hen38 /&gt;

Lamar wanted the [[Rio Grande]] to be the western boundary of Texas. He wanted to send an [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition|expedition]] to [[New Mexico]] to conquer it, and convince the residents, still loyal to Mexico, to join the Republic. The Texas Congress refused to fund the expedition in 1839 and 1840. In June 1841, Lamar took $89,000 from the treasury and sent an expedition on his own initiative. It was questioned on constitutional grounds. Its members were arrested when they reached [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], and were told they would soon be released. Instead, under guard, they were marched to prison in [[Mexico City]], and many died during the journey.&lt;ref name=hen38 /&gt;

Lamar has been called "the Father of Texas Education" because of his provisions of land to support it. During his administration, he convinced the legislature to set aside three leagues of land in each county to be devoted to school development. He also allotted 50 leagues of land for the support of two universities, later developed as [[Texas A&amp;M University]] (1876), under the [[Morrill Act]], and the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] (1883). Although no facilities were constructed during his term, he provided the base for a statewide public school system.&lt;ref name=hen37 /&gt; Government gave 18,000 acres of public land for public schools. He wanted education to be a priority to cultivate a knowledgeable citizenry.

In keeping with other slave societies in the South, Texas prohibited the few [[Free negro|free blacks]] from schools. A public school system was not firmly established until after the [[American Civil War]], when the [[Reconstruction era]] legislature created an endowment to finance a school system. In 1869, it passed a law to give the public school fund the proceeds from sale of public lands. The constitution of that year authorized the legislature to establish school districts and appoint directors. [[Freedmen]]'s children were included in the system, despite much opposition.&lt;ref&gt;W.E.B. Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880'', New York: Free Press, 1935/1998 edition, p.560&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lamar left office in 1841, Texas was almost 7 million dollars in debt, the majority of which was accrued from his policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mirabeau B. Lamar|author=[[Texas State Library and Archives Commission]]|url=https://www.tsl.texas.gov/exhibits/presidents/lamar/mrprez.html|access-date=9 January 2017|quote="... To finance his ambitious schemes, he counted on loans from England and France that never came through. During his term of office, the Texas government collected about a million dollars in taxes and spent almost five million."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|title=Mirabeau Buonaparte Lamar|year=1998|access-date=9 January 2017|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mirabeau-Buonaparte-Lamar|quote=Lamar's constant military campaigning against the Indians and his costly exploits into New Mexico nearly bankrupted Texas. When he left office in 1841, the republic's debt stood at more than $7,000,000.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Houston was elected again as president after Lamar. The latter returned to service in the army, and distinguished himself in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] at the [[Battle of Monterrey]] during the [[Mexican–American War]]. During this period of time, money was tight in Texas; Lamar borrowed money from his banker cousin [[Gazaway Bugg Lamar]]. Some of the letters on this subject between the two are amusing.&lt;ref&gt;Gulick, Charles Adams Jr, ''The Papers of Mirabeau Buonaparte Lamar,'' A.C. Baldwin &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1847, he was assigned as a post commander at [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]], but disliked the job as he wanted more action.&lt;ref name=hen39&gt;Hendrickson (1995), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamar was elected from Eagle Pass in the [[Texas Legislature]] for several years after [[Texas annexation|Texas was annexed]] to the [[United States]] in 1845. In 1857, President [[James Buchanan]] appointed Lamar as the Minister to [[Nicaragua]], and a few months later to [[Costa Rica]]. He served in [[Managua]] for twenty months before returning to Texas in October 1859 because of poor health. He died of a heart attack at his [[Richmond, Texas|Richmond]] plantation on December 19, 1859.&lt;ref name=hen39/&gt;

Lamar's volume of collected poems, ''Verse Memorials,'' was published in 1857 (New York, W.P. Fetridge &amp; Co., 224 pages).

==Origins==
===Ancestry===
The Nadikerianda clan name originated from the words ''Nadu keri'' ('Central village') and the suffix ''anda'' which means 'belonging to'. Incidentally, Nadikeri is the name of a village in South Kodagu as well. According to a family tree drawn by Nadikerianda Chinnappa himself the earliest remembered ancestors of the clan were Nadikerianda Aiyanna and his wife Mayamma who lived around 1600 CE. This family tree was drawn up in 1918. The most notable legendary members of this clan were Nadikerianda Devayya and Kaaruvanna, the first was a folk ballad hero whose clan was responsible for the Malethirike shrine on top of the Somagiri peak, near the Nadikerianda ancestral house in Karada village. He was cursed by a powerful tantric. Kaaruvanna was his heroic brother who redeemed his spirit. They are considered to be the Kaarana or Kaarona (revered ancestors) of the clan. (Ramachandrachar 4:1994)

Nadikerianda Chinnappa was born in 1875 in the village of Karada, Napoklu naad in Coorg (now [[Kodagu]]) to [[Kodava people|Kodava]] parents Nadikerianda Aiyanna (not to be mistaken for the early ancestor who had the same name) and Pattamada Ponnavva. They had eight children, four daughters and four sons; Chinnappa was the fifth eldest, he had two elder sisters, two elder brothers (Subbayya and Kaalappa), two younger sisters and one younger brother. His mother was a lady of the Pattamada clan who knew horse-riding. (Ramachandrachar 5:1994)

==Early life==
===Education===
After matriculating in Mercara from the Central High School he did his F.A.(First Year Arts) from Mangalore. In college he was good at sports, especially in Hockey and Cricket, and in studies. He got married to his deceased brother Subbayya's widow, Nanjavva, in accordance to tradition, in Coorg and worked as a teacher in Mercara Central High School.

===Career===
In 1899 he joined the revenue department and became a Senebaayi (Shanbhog or Accountant). That year in September he wrote an English poem, 'My Position as Shanbog', voicing his frustration with his job. The following year he became a Revenue Inspector and in 1902 he joined the Coorg Regiment of the army and rose to become a Subedar-Major. When the regiment was disbanded in 1904 he joined the Police Department, underwent training in Vellore and became a sub-Inspector in Kushalnagar. Thereafter he served in Napoklu, Srimangala and Virajpet for some five or six years each until he was made Prosecuting sub-Inspector and posted in [[Madikeri]]. Later he became a Prosecuting Inspector in Coorg.

His job in the Police Force required him to travel on horseback to the villages nestled in the valleys and hills of Kodagu. While he went about his duties, he witnessed local festivals and listened to folk-songs that were a part of his culture and was fascinated by them. He feared that these traditions and songs that were handed down orally over the generations would in time be forgotten, because of the dominance of the English language, and influence of the cultures of the neighbouring areas. He got acquainted with several folk-singers and often, when he returned after his day's work, he brought them home on his horse. He asked his wife to feed them and having served them local toddy, he got them to sing the folk-songs they knew, as they beat the dudi (small, hand-held, hourglass-shaped Coorg drum), while he transcribed the words of the songs, late into the night. By the year 1922 he had compiled many folk-songs and gathered enough material on the customs and traditions of Kodavas for his book, which he called the [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]]. He also collected nearly 750 Kodava idioms and proverbs for the book.

==Pattole Palame==

===Name===
‘Pattole' is derived from patt-pole which means 'silk-like', and 'Palame' means 'lore' or 'stories'. Thus [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]] stands for 'Silken Lore'. There is yet another interpretation of the title. In the olden days, family histories, rituals and other records were scripted on palm leaves by astrologers. These ancient, scripted leaves called Pattole (patt=silk, ole=palm leaf) or 'silken palm leaf' are still preserved in many Kodava Ainmanes (ancestral homes). Palame also referred to the hereditary oral tradition of folk songs and ballads among the Kodavas.

===Reviews and publication===
The '''[[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]]''', a collection of [[Kodava language|Kodava]] folksongs and traditions compiled in the early 1900s by Nadikerianda Chinnappa, was first published in 1924. Some British officials who were interested in Indology(C. S. Sooter and C. Hilton Brown) encouraged Chinnappa in his effort and asked some prominent Kodavas – District Magistrate Rao Saheb (later Dewan Bahadur) Ketolira Chengappa, Retd. Mysore Councillor Rao Bahadur Kodanda Madayya and Retd. Assistant Commissioner Kodandera
Kuttayya to review his draft book. When these reviewers commended the book, C.S.Sooter, the then Commissioner of Coorg, got the British Government to provide financial assistance to the author to publish it. Kullachanda Karumbayya was the proof examiner for the book.

===Folksongs===
Nearly two-thirds of the book consists of folksongs that were handed down orally through generations. Many of these songs are sung even today during marriage and death ceremonies, during Kodava festivals relating to the seasons and during festivals in honour of local deities and heroes. Traditionally known as ''Balo Pat'', these songs are sung by four men who beat dudis (small, handheld, hourglass-shaped Coorg drums) as they sing. The songs have haunting melodies and evoke memories of times long past. Kodava folk dances are performed to the beat of many of these songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book Details 'Pattole Palame' |url=http://isbndb.com/d/book/pattole_palame.html|publisher=ISBN Database|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second edition of ''[[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]]'' (or 'Silken Lore'), published by the University of Mysore in 1975, the editor describes it as one of the earliest, if not the earliest, extensive collection of folklore of any Indian community written in an Indian language by an Indian.&lt;ref name="It's story time, folks"/&gt; The fourth edition of the [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]] was published in 2002 by the Karnataka Kodava Sahitya Academy.

==Bhagvathanda Patt==

In 1929, Chinnappa's translation of the Bhagwat Gita into Kodava thakk, called Bhagvathanda Patt, got published. This was written in the style of the Balopattu (Palame songs) and in a simple manner which could be understood by common people as well.

==Sri Moola Kanniye ==

On 1 October 1917, Nadikerianda Chinnappa wrote a patriotic song in Kodava thakk ''Sri Moola Kanniye'' ('Primal Goddess'). He called this the ''Swadesha Priya Keerthana'' (literally 'Hymn of the love for self-rule') and the 'National Anthem'. This song is dedicated to the Goddess Kaveri, the patron of Kodagu and the Kodavas. One must note that this song was written in the pre-Independence age when the British Raj ruled over India and Indians were being stirred by the call for a sovereign nation ruled by themselves.

This song was included in the 'Introduction' of the original version of the [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]] that was released in 1924, but was inadvertently omitted in the second and the third editions, that came out in 1975 and 1995. However, in the fourth (2002) and fifth (2006) editions these omissions were noticed by the grandchildren of Chinnappa, who had been abroad those many years, and hence subsequently included. Chinnappa's family members and relatives sing this song as their daily prayer.

===Linguistic Survey===

Between 1913 and 1920 Grierson began the first Linguistic Survey of India. He wanted knowledgeable representatives of various Indian languages to translate a biblical parable into their language and to either sing a song or to narrate a story from their language. Needless to say Nadikerianda Chinnappa, who was well-versed in both English and Kodava thakk (besides Kannada), was chosen as the representative of the Kodava language.(Biddappa:20 1996) In 1922, after narrating the Kodava thakk rendering of the biblical parable 'Prodigal son',&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/lsi/118AK  Kodava thakk rendering of a biblical passage, in Chinnappa's voice] Retrieved 1 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; he sang his own composition, the poem titled ''The Coorg national anthem: Swadēsi priya kirtane'' ('Patriot's hymn').&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/lsi/119AK Sri Mula Kanniye in the poet's voice]. Retrieved 1 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; These gramophone recordings became part of the Linguistic Survey of India collection. (Ramachandrachar 7:1994)

A copy of these recordings were kept in the British Library's 'Sound Archives' in London and in the Madras Museum. This was digitised recently by the Linguistics Department of the University of Chicago&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.wn.com/view/2010/10/14/Rare_audio_of_Rajera_linguistic_survey_now_just_a_click_away/  Rare audios of Raj era (Newspaper article)]. Retrieved 1 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Kodava thakk is called Kodaga and it is wrongly identified as being a language of the erstwhile Madras province. The archives don't credit Chinnappa, they simply state that the narrator is unknown. Upon hearing the recording in the Madras museum in the early 1970s, his son, Subbayya, who had known about the recording, recognised his father's voice. Chinnappa's grandson N. S. Nanjappa has since informed the concerned authorities in the University of Chicago about the name of the narrator.

== Renaissance Man==

Nadikerianda Chinnappa was a renaissance man of his times. He was a compiler, poet, translator, army man, police officer, cricket player, historian, singer and philanthropist.

===Poet===
Although he was best known for his compilation work, the [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]], he wrote original work in three languages: Kodava thakk, Kannada and English. Chinnappa was also a well-known Kodava thakk poet, his most famous work being Bhagavanthanda Paat, the translation of the Bhagavad Gita into Kodava thakk in the folksong style. His popular poem ''Sri Moola Kanniye'' ('The Primal Goddess'),in Kodava thakk, is called the Kodava anthem. He also wrote a well-known poem in Kannada and it was titled ''Somagirija Deva'', on the deity of the Nadikerianda clan, at the Malethirike shrine.

===Sportsperson===
He used to play different sports regularly at the Victoria Club in [[Virajpet]]. A very good bowler in the game of cricket, he was a member of the All Coorg XI cricket team. Beside being part of the Coorg XI cricket team and playing field hockey, he also played billiards and tennis at the Victoria Club. Many of the Europeans who frequented the Club would mutter under their breathe upon losing to him. One day he lost his patience during a game of billiards and he broke the stick. This was seen as a very daring thing for a petty officer under the majesty's service to do before the European officers. (Ramachandrachar 11:1994)

===Philanthropist===
He was also involved in establishing the Coorg Central Bank and the Coorg Education Fund. As a philanthropist he sponsored the education of many poor and orphaned children in Kodagu. In fact, at any point of time during his employment in the Police Department there used to be around 8–10 students boarding in his [[Madikeri]] and [[Virajpet]] residences, free of cost. Chinnappa encouraged Boverianda Muthanna, a brilliant student from the neighbouring village of Nariandada, to pursue his higher education by applying to the Coorg Education Fund for financial support. Muttanna studied in [[Bangalore]] Central College where he earned a gold medal in English. He joined the College of Engineering, Guindy, in Madras province (now, in Chennai, Tamil Nadu). Later Chinnappa's daughter Gangamma married Muthanna. (Ramachandrachar 10:1994)

==Legacy==
''Nadikerianda Chinnappa'' and Appaneravanda Hardas [[Appachcha Kavi]] are the two important poets and writers of the [[Kodava language]]. These two pioneers were the earliest known to write Kodava thakk in the Kannada script. Nadikerianda Chinnappa is well known for his magnum opus the '[[Pattole Palome]]', a compilation of the folk songs and hymns of the Kodavas. The [[Kodava language]], called the Kodava thakk ('speech of the Kodavas'), is a tongue rather than a written language, spoken in [[Kodagu]] (earlier known as Coorg), a district of Karnataka State in South India. Formerly thought of as a Kannada dialect, it is now recognised as a separate Indian language of the Dravidian family. It has a very recent literature dating from the early 20th century.

The text of the [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]] was in Kannada and the folksongs, proverbs etc., in it were in Kodava thakk, written using the Kannada script. Nadikerianda Chinnappa had begun translating the work into English in 1925 but he died in 1931, before he could complete it. This work is considered the main literature of the Kodava language. This book is also referred by the Kodava Hindus who seek to clarify ancient traditions. The 119th birth anniversary of Chinnappa was celebrated in 1994 jointly by the Karnataka Janapada (folk) association and the [[Yakshagana]] Academy. The [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]] has become the chief text on [[Kodava people|Kodava]] customs and traditions for Kodavas.

==Family==

Chinnappa had four sons and two daughters but among them his first three sons died, the surviving children were two daughters (Gangamma and Muthamma) and one son (Subbayya). He also had two step children, a boy and a girl (Aiyanna and Bojamma), the children of Nanjavva and his late elder brother Subbayya. Besides these five surviving children he also adopted his widowed sister Chinnavva's daughter Akkamma.

His son Subbayya (Mittu), who was a BEd trained teacher, was engaged to marry Neravanda Nanjappa's daughter Ponnamma, who was also a teacher. But before the marriage was to happen, Chinnappa died of cancer, aged 56, on 12 September 1931, only a few months after his retirement from the Police service. Subbayya also wrote poetry and drama. He became the Asst. Education Officer of Coorg, before retirement. He was responsible for starting many High Schools in Coorg. Nadikerianda Subbayya's daughter Nanjamma was married to Gangamma's son Bovverianda Chinnappa. [[N. Ponnappa|N.S. Ponnappa]], the famous cartoonist is Nadikerianda Chinnappa's youngest grandson – son of Subbayya and Ponnamma.

==Translation==

In the 1970s, over almost three years, Boverianda Chinnappa, Nanjamma and Nanjamma's mother began to copy out in longhand the partially completed rough translation of the [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]] done by Nadikerianda Chinnappa.[5]&lt;ref name="It's story time, folks"&gt;{{cite news |title=It's story time, folks |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2003/10/16/stories/2003101600630300.htm |newspaper=The Hindu |accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanjamma's parents assisted in translating and interpreting the text. After retirement from Canada in 1995, the [[Boverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa|Boverianda Chinnappas]] settled down in [[Bangalore]] and began to realise the author's cherished dream of translating the [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]] into English.

While they were searching for copies of the original edition of the [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]], a ninety-year-old farmer and self-taught folk artist, Bacharaniyanda Annaiah, responded to their advertisement. During his youth unable to afford the book he had copied out the entire text word by word under the light of a kerosene lamp, after a hard day's work in the rice fields. He gave this notebook to the [[Boverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa|Boverianda Chinnappas]]. They also consulted many elders from Kodagu for the meanings of archaic words in the folk-songs and proverbs.

Finally in 2003, they completed the work and it has been published by Rupa &amp; Co., New Delhi. That same year it was released in Madikeri (Mercara) and in Dakshinachitra, Chennai. [[N. Ponnappa|N.S. Ponnappa]] did the cover painting for the book and illustrated it with beautiful line drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://indianfolklore.org/journals/index.php/IFRJ/article/download/182/189 |title=Pattole Palame: Kodava Culture – Folksongs and Traditions |first=M.

[[File:Nahum Sokolow.jpg|thumb|150x|Nahum Sokolow]]

'''Nahum Sokolow''' ('''Nahum ben Joseph Samuel Sokolow''', {{lang-he-n|נחום ט' סוקולוב}} ''Nachum ben Yosef Shmuel Soqolov'', {{lang-yi|סאָקאָלאָוו}}, &lt;span dir= "ltr"&gt;10 January 1859 – 17 May 1936&lt;/span&gt;) was a [[Zionism|Zionist]] leader, author, translator, and a pioneer of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] journalism.

==Biography==
[[File:Sokołow.jpg|thumb|150px|Nahum Sokolow, 1910]]
Nahum Sokolow was born in  [[Wyszogród]], near [[Plock]], [[Poland]] (then [[Russian Empire]]). He began to attend [[heder]] at the age of three. When he was five, his parents moved to Plock. At the age of ten,  he was already renowned as a Hebrew scholar. His father wanted him to study for the rabbinate but with the intervention of Baron Wrangel, the governor of Plock, he enrolled in a secular school. He married at eighteen and settled in Makov, where his father-in-law lived, and earned a living as a wool merchant. At the age of 20, he moved to Warsaw and became a regular contributor to the Hebrew daily [[HaTzefirah]].  Eventually he wrote his own column and went on to become editor and co-owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1931/01/23/archive/our-leader-nahum-sokolov-celebrates-his-seventieth-birthday-statement-issued-by-zionist-executive|title=Our Leader Nahum Sokolov Celebrates His Seventieth Birthday: Statement Issued by Zionist Executive:|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1914, after the outbreak of World War I, he moved to London to work with [[Chaim Weizmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=SYW0AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=sokolow+moved+to+london&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IyXLWExVaU&amp;sig=RmPf9mFmwfXn8I7NnQ8VN04_4oo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB6f6k5JLWAhXDyRoKHaXHAOUQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=sokolow+moved+to+london&amp;f=true|title=Historical Dictionary of Zionism|first=Rafael|last=Medoff|date=5 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sokolow died in London in 1936.

==Literary career==
Sokolow was a prolific author and translator. His works include a three-volume history of [[Baruch Spinoza]] and his times, and various other biographies. He was the first to translate [[Theodor Herzl]]'s [[utopia]]n novel ''[[The Old New Land|Altneuland]]'' into Hebrew, giving it the name ''Tel Aviv'' (literally, "An Ancient Hill of Spring"). In 1909, the name was adopted for the first modern Hebrew-speaking [[Tel Aviv|city]].

==Zionist activism==
In 1906 Sokolow was asked to become the secretary general of the [[World Zionist Congress]].  In the ensuing years, he crisscrossed Europe and North America to promote the [[Zionist]] cause. After moving to London, he was a leading advocate for the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]], in which the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] government declared its support for a [[Jewish homeland]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

On 6 February 1917 a meeting was held in Maida Vale with Weizmann to discuss the results of the Picot convention in Paris.  Sokolow and Weizmann pressed on after seizing leadership from Gaster; they were granted official recognition from the British government. &lt;ref&gt;Schneer, p.202&lt;/ref&gt;
Historian [[Martin Kramer]] argues that securing the assent of Britain's French and American Allies, and of the Vatican, which controlled many Christian Holy Sites in the Land of Israel, was a necessary precondition of the [[Balfour Declaration]]. Sokolow secured the support of [[Pope Benedict XV]] on 4 May 1917.  Pope Benedict described the return of the Jews to Palestine as "providential; God has willed it.".&lt;ref name="KramerInternationalLaw"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kramer|first1=Martin|title=How the Balfour Declaration Became Part of International Law|url=https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/2017/06/how-the-balfour-declaration-became-part-of-international-law/|accessdate=14 June 2017|work=[[Mosaic (magazine)|Mosaic]]|date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sokolow secured the assent of the France in the [[Cambon letter]] of 4 June 1917, signed by [[Jules Cambon]], head of the political section of the French foreign ministry.&lt;ref name="KramerInternationalLaw"/&gt;

Chaim Weizmann wrote to the Manchester Zionist, [[Harry Sacher]], who became a focus for the view that Sokolow and Weizmann had capitulated; forfeiting the right to lead by "preferring British Imperialism ... to Zionism".&lt;ref&gt;Stein, 'Letters', letter no.313, 7335, WI – filed miscellaneous; Schneer, p.207&lt;/ref&gt; Sokolow acted as Weizmann's eyes and ears in Paris on a diplomatic mission with Sir Mark Sykes to negotiate with the French.  The idea that the Jews would form a new kind of Triple Entente under the Ottoman Empire was unsettling to them.  Nonetheless the delegation left for Paris on 31 March 1917.  One purpose of the Entente was to strengthen the hand of Zionism in USA.  "The Jews represented a powerful political and economic force...if subterranean influence".&lt;ref&gt;Sykes to Picot, 28 February 1917, Oxford, St Anthony's, MEC, SP, GB 165-0275/32B; Schneer, p.211&lt;/ref&gt; Sokolow did not know of the Sykes-Picot Agreement and British/French understanding on Middle Eastern policy matters.  He believed that he must report to Weizmann that what France really meant by a "Greater Syria", taking the whole of Palestine for themselves.  In a series of letters in April and May 1917, Weizmann accused Sokolow of letting the Zionists down in negotiations with France; Sokolow countered by replying that he remained totally committed to a British Palestine.

Rupaisen, Ben-Zion Mossinson, H. Farbstein, Nahum Sokolow, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, [[Yosef Sprinzak]], I. L. Goldberg, [[Shmaryahu Levin]], [[Eliezer Kaplan]].]]

The [[desiderata]] or things desired by the Jews for their new homeland – "facilities of colonization, communal autonomy, rights of language and establishment of a Jewish chartered company."&lt;ref&gt;Sokolow to Weizmann, 4 April 1917, CZA, Sokolow Papers&lt;/ref&gt; Sokolow eventual diplomacy triumph for Zionism in Paris "they accept in principle the recognition of Jewish nationality in the capacity of National Home, local autonomy etc. It is beyond my boldest expectations...", he wrote.  They expected a quid pro quo for support against Germany, which was further made urgent by the entry of USA on 6 April 1917 to the global conflict.  They now associated an Allied victory with securing "Zionist aspirations", a phrase also used by Sykes in his despatches to Balfour.&lt;ref&gt;NA, FO371/3045; Schneer, 395&lt;/ref&gt;
On 9 April, the Paris conference ended, marking a high-point in Sokolow's career.  The Zionists were now open to all diplomatic rounds.  Sokolov came to Rome to gain support for the plan of a Jewish state in Palestine, where he spoke to Monsignor [[Eugenio Pacelli]], the future Pope Pius XII.  That Pope [[Benedict XV]] had vehemently condemned antisemitism a year before was seen as a good omen.

In Rome, the Vatican City were considering accepting terms.  Sokolow's letters asked advice from Weizmann;  the amazed Sokolow met the Pope on 6 May.  The Zionists began to feel more confident about their patriotism.  Sokolow asked for "moral support" – a philosophical equality, and immediately wrote Weizmann about the "expressing of favour".  But Weizmann was not so emotional; being tough hard-headed business-like character.  He congratulated Sokolow on the success.  Sokolow was called upon to stop at Paris by [[Jules Cambon]] and Prime Minister, [[Alexandre Ribot]].  They were still concerned that Zionism would cause unlimited damage to world security if unleashed in Bolshevik Russia. 

In 1931 Nahum Sokolow was elected President of the World Zionist Congress, and served in that capacity until 1935, when he was succeeded by [[Chaim Weizmann]].  He also served as President of the [[Jewish Agency for Palestine]] (now called the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]]) between 1931 and 1933 and was succeeded by [[Arthur Ruppin]].

'''Nicholas of Cusa''' (1401 – 11 August 1464), also referred to as '''Nicholas of Kues''' and '''Nicolaus Cusanus''' ({{IPAc-en|k|j|uː|ˈ|s|eɪ|n|ə|s}}), was a [[Germans|German]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Theology|theologian]], [[jurist]], and [[Astronomy|astronomer]]. One of the first German proponents of [[Renaissance humanism]], he made spiritual and political contributions in European history. A notable example of this is his mystical or spiritual writings on "learned ignorance," as well as his participation in power struggles between [[Roman Curia|Rome]] and the German states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

[[Papal legate]] to Germany from 1446, he was appointed [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] for his merits by [[Pope Nicholas V]] in 1448 and [[Bishopric of Brixen|Prince–Bishop of Brixen]] two years later. In 1459 he became [[vicar general]] in the [[Papal States]].

Nicholas of Cusa has remained an influential figure. In 2001, the sixth centennial of his birth was celebrated on four continents and commemorated by publications on his life and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Izbicki|first=Thomas M.|date=Spring 2007|title=Cusanus: The Legacy of Learned Ignorance|url=|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Bernkastel Kues Geburtshaus Nikolaus von Kues.jpg|thumb|left|Birthplace in Kues]]
Nicholas was born in [[Bernkastel-Kues|Kues]] ([[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] as "Cusa") in southwestern Germany. He was the second of four children of Johan Krebs (or Cryfftz) and Katherina Roemer. His father was "a prosperous boat owner and ferryman."&lt;ref&gt;Donald F. Duclow, "Life and Works", ''in'' Christopher M. Bellitto, Thomas M. Izbicki, Gerald Christianson (Eds.), ''Introducing Nicholas of Cusa, A Guide to a Renaissance Man'', Paulist Press, 2004, p25&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the [[Faculty of Arts]] of the [[Heidelberg University]] in 1416 as "a cleric of the [[Electorate of Trier|Diocese of Trier]]", studying the [[liberal arts education|liberal arts]]. He seemed to have left Heidelberg soon afterwards, as he received his doctorate in [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] from the [[University of Padua]] in 1423. In Padua, he met with the later cardinals [[Julian Cesarini]] and [[Domenico Capranica]] and became friends with the mathematician [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli]]. Afterwards, he entered the [[University of Cologne]] in 1425 as "a doctor of canon law," which he appears to have both taught and practiced there. In Cologne, he made friends with the scholastic theologian [[Heymeric de Campo]].

Following a brief period in Cologne, Nicholas returned to his hometown and became secretary to Otto of Ziegenhain, the [[Elector of Trier|Prince–Archbishop of Trier]]. Otto appointed him [[Canon (priest)|canon]] and [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] at the [[stift]] of [[Florinus of Remüs|Saint Florinus]] in [[Koblenz]] affiliated with numerous [[prebendary|prebends]]. In 1427 he was sent to Rome as an episcopal delegate. The next year he travelled to [[Paris]] to study the writings of [[Ramon Llull]]. At the same time he rejected a calling by the newly established [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]]. He acquired great knowledge in the research of ancient and mediæval [[manuscript]]s as well as in [[textual criticism]] and the examination of [[primary source]]s. In 1433 he identified the ''[[Donation of Constantine]]'' as a fake, confirmed by [[Lorenzo Valla]] a few years later, and revealed the forgery of the ''[[Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals]]''. He made friends with the Austrian astronomer [[Georg von Peuerbach]] and advocated a reform of the [[Julian calendar]] and the Easter [[computus]], which, however, was not realized until the introduction of the [[Gregorian calendar]] in 1582.

After the Archbishop Otto of Trier had died in 1430, [[Pope Martin V]] appointed the [[Bishopric of Speyer|Speyer]] bishop Raban of [[Helmstadt-Bargen|Helmstatt]] his successor. Nevertheless, the Electorate was contested by opposing parties, and in 1432 Nicholas attended the [[Council of Florence|Council of Basel]] representing the Cologne dean Ulrich von Manderscheid, one of the claimants,&lt;ref&gt;Donald F. Duclow, "Life and Works", ''in'' Christopher M. Bellitto, Thomas M. Izbicki, Gerald Christianson (Eds.), ''Introducing Nicholas of Cusa, A Guide to a Renaissance Man'', Paulist Press, 2004, pp. 25-56 at pp. 26-29.&lt;/ref&gt; who hoped to prevail against the new [[Pope Eugene IV]]. Nicholas stressed the determining influence of the cathedral chapter and its given right to participate in the succession policy, which even places the pope under an obligation to seek a consent. His efforts were to no avail in regard to Ulrich's ambitions; however, Nicholas' pleadings earned him a great reputation as an intermediary and diplomat. While present at the council, he wrote his first work, ''De concordantia catholica'' (''The Catholic Concordance''), a synthesis of ideas on church and empire balancing hierarchy with consent. This work remained useful to critics of the papacy long after Nicholas left Basel.&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Sigmund, ''Nicholas of Cusa and Medieval Political Thought'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially as [[Conciliarism|conciliarist]], Nicholas approached to his university friend Cardinal Julian Cesarini, who had tried to reconcile pope and council, combining reform and hierarchic order. Nicholas supported transfer of the council to Italy to meet with the Greeks, who needed aid against the [[Ottoman Turks]]. He arbitrated in the conflict with the [[Hussite]]s. Between the summer of 1437 and early 1438 he was a member of the delegation sent to Constantinople with the pope's approval to bring back the Byzantine emperor and his representatives to the papally summoned [[Council of Florence]] of 1439, which was attempting to bring the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] into union with the Western [[Catholic Church]]. The reunion achieved at this conference turned out to be very brief. Nicholas would later claim (in the postfaced dedicatory letter of ''On Learned Ignorance'', which Nicholas finished writing on 12 February 1440) that he had chosen to write on this metaphysical topic because of a shipboard experience of divine illumination while on the ship returning from this mission to Constantinople.

After a successful career as a papal envoy, he was made a cardinal by [[Pope Nicholas V]] in 1448 or 1449. In 1450 he was both named [[Bishop of Brixen]], in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], and commissioned as a [[papal legate]] to the German lands to spread the message of reform. This latter role, his 'Great Legation' of 1450-2, involved travel of almost 3000 miles, preaching, teaching and reforming. He became known as ''the Hercules of the Eugenian cause''.&lt;ref&gt;Duclow, "Life and Works," pp. 29-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  His local councils enacted reforms, many of which were not successful.  Pope Nicholas canceled some of Nicholas' decrees, and the effort to discourage pilgrimages to venerate the bleeding hosts of [[Wilsnack]] (the so-called [[Holy Blood of Wilsnack]]) was unsuccessful. His work as bishop between 1452 and 1458 – trying to impose reforms and reclaim lost diocesan revenues – was opposed by [[Sigismund, Archduke of Austria|Duke Sigismund of Austria]].  The duke imprisoned Nicholas in 1460, for which [[Pope Pius II]] [[excommunication|excommunicated]] Sigismund and laid an [[Interdict (Roman Catholic Church)|interdict]] on his lands. Nicholas of Cusa returned to Rome, but was never able to return to his bishopric.

He died at [[Todi]] in [[Umbria]] on 11 August 1464. Sigmund's capitulation came a few days after Nicholas's death.&lt;ref&gt;Duclow, "Life and Works," pp. 38-48.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:S. Pietro in Vincoli 021.JPG|thumb|225px|Tomb in S.Pietro in Vincoli, Rome, with the relief "Cardinal Nicholas before St Peter" by [[Andrea Bregno]] ]]

Upon his death, Cusanus's body was interred in the church of [[San Pietro in Vincoli]] in Rome, probably near the relic of Peter's chains; but it was later lost. His monument, with a sculpted image of the cardinal, remains. Two other tombstones, one medieval and one modern, also are found in the church.  In accordance with his wishes, his heart rests within the chapel altar at the [[Cusanusstift]] in Kues. To this charitable institution that he had founded he bequeathed his entire inheritance: it still stands, and serves the purpose Nicholas intended for it, as a home for the aged. The Cusanusstift houses also many of his manuscripts.[http://www.cusanus.de/]

==Philosophy==
Nicholas of Cusa was noted for his deeply [[mysticism|mystical]] writings about [[Christianity]], particularly on the possibility of knowing God with the divine human mind — not possible through mere human means — via "learned ignorance". Cusanus wrote of the enfolding of creation in God and their unfolding in creation.  He was suspected by some of holding [[pantheism|pantheistic]] beliefs, but his writings were never accused of being [[heresy|heretical]].&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Hopkins, ''Nicholas of Cusa's Debate with John Wenck: A Translation and an Appraisal of ''De Ignota Litteratura'' and ''Apologia Doctae Ignorantiae'' '', 3rd ed., (Minneapolis, MN: Banning, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist and philosopher [[Max Bernhard Weinstein]] wrote that Nicholas was, to a certain extent, a [[Pandeist]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Bernhard Weinsten, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 306: "Er ist bis zu einem gewissen Grade Pandeist. Gott schafft die Welt nur aus sich (de nullo alio creat, sed ex se); indem er alles umfaßt, entfaltet er alles aus sich, ohne doch sich dabei irgend zu verändern."&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas also wrote in ''De coniecturis'' about using conjectures or surmises to rise to better understanding of the truth.  The individual might rise above mere reason to the vision of the intellect, but the same person might fall back from such vision.

Theologically, Nicholas anticipated the profound implications of Reformed teaching on the [[harrowing of Hell]] (Sermon on Psalm 30:11), followed by [[Pico della Mirandola]], who similarly explained the ''descensus'' in terms of Christ’s agony.

==Science and mathematics==
Most of Nicholas of Cusa's mathematical ideas can be found in his essays, ''[[De Docta Ignorantia]]'' (''Of Learned Ignorance''), ''De Visione Dei'' (''On the Vision of God'') and ''On Conjectures''. He also wrote on [[squaring the circle]] in his mathematical treatises.

From the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1913 edition):
&lt;blockquote&gt;The astronomical views of the cardinal are scattered through his philosophical treatises. They evince complete independence of traditional doctrines, though they are based on symbolism of numbers, on combinations of letters, and on abstract speculations rather than observation. The earth is a star like other stars, is not the centre of the universe, is not at rest, nor are its poles fixed. The celestial bodies are not strictly spherical, nor are their orbits circular. The difference between theory and appearance is explained by relative motion. Had [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] been aware of these assertions he would probably have been encouraged by them to publish his own monumental work.&lt;ref name=cathen&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author=Hagen, J.|title = Nicholas of Cusa | encyclopedia =The Catholic Encyclopedia | volume =11 | publisher =Robert Appleton Company | year =1911 | url =http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11060b.htm | accessdate =2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like [[Nicole Oresme]], Nicholas of Cusa also wrote about the possibility of the plurality of worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Dick, Steven J. Plurality of Worlds: The Extraterrestrial Life Debate from Democritus to Kant. Cambridge University Press (June 29, 1984). pgs 35-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Medieval &amp; Renaissance Astronomy", Australia Telescope National Facility.

[[Sir Norman Moore, 1st Baronet|Norman Moore]], M.D., tells us in The Fitz-Patrick Lectures of 1905:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In medicine he introduced an improvement which in an altered form has continued in use to this day. This improvement was the counting of the pulse which up to his time had been felt and discussed in many ways but never counted. ...Nicholas of Cusa proposed to compare the rate of pulses by weighing the quantity of water run out of a water clock while the pulse beat one hundred times. ...The manufacture of watches with second-hands has since given us a simpler method of counting, but the merit of introducing this useful kind of observation into clinical medicine belongs to Nicholas of Cusa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore|first=Norman, M.D.|title=The Fitz-Patrick Lectures for 1905|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HbZMAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1525&amp;|work=The Lancet, Vol.2, Part 2, p.1525 (Oct-Dec, 1905)|publisher=J. Onwhyn|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Politics==
In 1433, Nicholas proposed reform of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and a method to elect [[Holy Roman Emperors]]. Although it was not adopted by the Church, his method was essentially the same one known today as the [[Borda count]], which is used in many academic institutions, competitions, and even some political jurisdictions, in original form and a number of variations. His proposal preceded [[Jean-Charles de Borda|Borda]]'s work by over three centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Gunter Hagele and Friedrich Pukelsheim, "The electoral systems of Nicholas of Cusa in the Catholic Concordance and beyond," in ''The Church, the Councils, &amp; Reform: The Legacy of the Fifteenth Century'', ed. Gerald Christianson, Thomas M. Izbicki and Christopher M. Bellitto, Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, 2008, pp. 229-249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas' opinions on the Empire, which he hoped to reform and strengthen, were cited against papal claims of temporal power in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.  Protestant writers were happy to cite a cardinal against Rome's pretensions.  Protestants, however, found his writings against the [[Hussites]] wrong.  Nicholas seemed to Protestants to give the church too much power to interpret Scripture, instead of treating it as self interpreting and self-sufficient for [[salvation]], the principle of [[sola scriptura]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. Izbicki, "'Their Cardinal Cusanus': Nicholas of Cusa in Tudor and Stuart polemics," in Izbicki, ''Reform, Ecclesiology, and the Christian Life in the Late Middle Ages'', Aldershott: Variorum, 2008, IX, pp. 1-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas' own thought on the church changed with his departure from Basel.  He tried arguing that the Basel assembly lacked the consent of the church throughout the world, especially the princes.  Then he tried arguing that the church was unfolded from Peter (''explicatio Petri'').&lt;ref&gt;Izbicki, "The Church," in ''Introducing Nicholas of Cusa'', pp. 113-140.&lt;/ref&gt;   This allowed him to support the pope without abandoning ideas of reform.  Thus he was able to propose to Pius II reform of the church, beginning with the pope himself.  Then it was to spread through the [[Roman curia]] and outward throughout Christendom.&lt;ref&gt;Morimichi Watanabe and Thomas M. Izbicki, “Nicholas of Cusa: A General Reform of the Church,” in ''Nicholas of Cusa on Christ and the Church: Essays in Memory of Chandler McCuskey Brooks for the American Cusanus Society'', ed. Gerald Christianson and Thomas M. Izbicki (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1996), pp. 175-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicolas of Cusa noted that government was founded on the [[consent of the governed]]:
:Accordingly, since by nature all men are free, any authority  by which subjects are prevented from doing evil and their freedom is restrained to doing good through fear from penalties, comes solely from harmony and from the consent of the subjects, whether the authority reside in written law or in the living law which is in the ruler. For if by nature men are equally strong and equally free, the true and settled power of one over the others, the ruler having equal natural power, could be set up only by the choice and consent of the others, just as a law also is set up by consent.&lt;ref&gt;''De concordantia catholica'' II xiv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Holland Sabine]] (1937) [[A History of Political Theory]], p 319, [[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nicholas and other religions==
Shortly after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, Nicholas wrote ''De pace fidei'', ''On the Peace of Faith''.  This visionary work imagined a summit meeting in [[Heaven]] of representatives of all nations and religions. [[Islam]] and the [[Hussite]] movement in [[Bohemia]] are represented. The conference agrees that there can be ''una religio in varietate rituum'', a single faith manifested in different rites, as manifested in the eastern and western rites of the [[Catholic Church]]. The dialog presupposes the greater accuracy of Christianity but gives respect to other religions.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. McTighe, "Nicholas of Cusa's Unity-Metaphysics and the Formula Religio una in rituum varietate", in Gerald Christianson and Thomas M. Izbicki (edd.), ''Nicholas of Cusa in Search of God and Wisdom: Essays in Honor of Morimichi Watanabe by the American Cusanus Society'', ed. Gerald Christianson and Thomas M. Izbicki (Leiden: Brill, 1991), pp. 161-172.&lt;/ref&gt; Less irenic but not virulent, is Cusanus' ''Cribratio Alchorani'', ''Sifting the Koran'', a detailed review of the Koran in Latin translation. While the arguments for the superiority of Christianity are still shown in this book, it also credits Judaism and Islam with sharing in the truth at least partially.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Hopkins, “The Role of ''Pia Interpretatio'' in Nicholas of Cusa’s Hermeneutical Approach to the Koran,” in Gregorio Piaia ed., ''Concordia discors: Studi su Niccolò Cusano e l’umanesimo europeo offerti a Giovanni Santinello'' Padua:  Antenore, 1993, pp. 251-273.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cusanus' attitude toward the Jews was not always mild; on 21 September 1451 he ordered that Jews of Arnhem were to wear badges identifying them as such. The ''De pace fidei'' mentions the possibility that the Jews might not embrace the larger union of ''una religio in varietate rituum'', but it dismisses them as politically insignificant. This matches the decrees from Cusanus' legation restricting Jewish activities, restrictions later canceled by Pope [[Nicholas V]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. Izbicki, "Nicholas of Cusa and the Jews," in ''Conflict and Reconciliation: Perspectives on Nicholas of Cusa'', ed. Inigo Bocken, Leiden: Brill, 2004, 119-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
Nicholas was widely read, and his works were published in the sixteenth century in both Paris and Basel. Sixteenth-century French scholars, including [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]] and [[Charles de Bovelles]], cited him.  Lefèvre even edited the Paris 1514 ''Opera''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Prefatory Epistles of Jacques Lefévre D'Etaples and Related Texts'', ed. Eugene F. Rice, New York: Columbia University Press, 1972; P. M. Sanders, "Charles de Bovelle's Treatise on Regular Polyhedra," ''Annals of Science'' 41 (1984): 513-566.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, there was no Cusan school, and his works were largely unknown until the nineteenth century, though [[Giordano Bruno]] quoted him, while some thinkers, like [[Gottfried Leibniz]], were thought to have been influenced by him.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Ctana, "The Meaning of ''contractio'' in Giordano Bruno's ''Sigillus sigillorum''." In ''Giordano Bruno: Philosopher of the Renaissance'', ed. Hilary Gatti, Aldershot, Ashgate, 2002, pp. 327-341; Thomas P. McTighe, "Nicholas of Cusa and Leibniz's Principle of Indiscernibility," ''The Modern Schoolman'' 42 (1964): 33-46.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neo-Kantian]] scholars began studying Nicholas in the nineteenth century, and new editions were begun by the ''[[Heidelberg Academy for Sciences and Humanities|Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften]]'' in the 1930s and published by Felix Meiner Verlag.&lt;ref&gt;Morimichi Watanabe, "The origins of modern Cusanus research in Germany and the establishment of the Heidelberg ''Opera Omnia''," in ''Nicholas of Cusa: In Search of God and Wisdom: Essays in Honor of Morimichi Watanabe by the American Cusanus Society'', ed. Gerald Christianson and Thomas M. Izbicki (Leiden: Brill, 1991), pp. 17-42.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early twentieth century, he was hailed as the 'first modern thinker',&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Cassirer, ''Individuum und Kosmos in der Philosophie der Renaissance'', (1927).&lt;/ref&gt; and much debate since then has centered around the question whether he should be seen as essentially a medieval or Renaissance figure. Societies and centers dedicated to Cusanus can be found in Argentina, [[Japan]], Germany, Italy and the United States. His well known quote about the infinity of the universe is found paraphrased in the Central Holy Book of the Thelemites, The Book of the Law, which was "received" from the Angel Aiwass by Aleister Crowley in Cairo in April 1904. " In the sphere I am everywhere the centre, as she, the circumference, is nowhere found".

In The Pursuit of God (1948), [[A. W. Tozer|A.W. Tozer]] refers to Nicholas as someone who had a vibrant Christian spirituality, stating in Chapter 7, "I should like to say more about this old man of God. He is not much known today anywhere among Christian believers, and among current Fundamentalists he is known not at all. I feel that we could gain much from a little acquaintance with men of his spiritual flavor and the school of Christian thought which they represent…"

[[Clint Eastwood]] has had numerous casual and long-term relationships of varying length and intensity since he was 14 years old. He was first married to Margaret "Maggie" Johnson in 1953, but while dating Johnson, he had another relationship that allegedly resulted in a child that the mother gave up for adoption. He had extramarital relationships while married to Johnson, including a 14 year long relationship with actress and stunt woman Roxanne Tunis that produced a daughter. Johnson reportedly tolerated an open marriage with Eastwood. Eastwood and Johnson were divorced and he continued seeing many other women. In 1975, actress [[Sondra Locke]] began living with Eastwood. She took the relationship seriously and was extremely distraught when she discovered much later that Eastwood continued to have sexual relationships with other women. When they separated, Locke filed a [[palimony]] lawsuit. Eastwood had two children with stewardess Jacelyn Reeves in the 1980s. He married for the second time to news anchor [[Dina Ruiz]] in 1996, which lasted until 2013. He has been seen with other women since then.

== Early sexual relationships ==

During an interview for the only authorized book ever written about himself, Eastwood told film historian [[Richard Schickel]] that he lost his virginity to a neighbor when he was 14 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; At age 19, Eastwood dated a schoolteacher in her 20s who stalked him and threatened to commit suicide after he broke up with her.&lt;ref&gt;Interviewed by [[Ginny Dougary]] for ''[[The Times]]'', 28 March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting upon this relationship, Eastwood told ''[[US Weekly]]'' in 1987, "There was just a little misinterpretation about how serious the whole thing was."&lt;ref&gt;"Clint Eastwood: The ''Us'' Interview". ''Us Weekly''. January 26, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriage to Margaret Johnson ==

During the summer of 1953, Eastwood met Margaret Neville "Maggie" Johnson (1931–), a secretary for auto parts suppliers Industria Americana, on a [[blind date]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munn |first=Michael |title=Clint Eastwood: Hollywood's Loner |publisher=Robson |year=1992 |location=London |isbn=978-0-86051-790-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}}&lt;ref name="McG55"&gt;McGilligan, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; They began dating. During the same summer, Eastwood had a serious relationship in Seattle with a young woman who became pregnant with his child.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Eastwood biographer [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], the mother gave the  girl up for adoption.&lt;ref name="McG500"&gt;McGilligan, p. 500&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson announced her engagement to him in October.&lt;ref name="McG55"/&gt;  Eastwood and Johnson married on December 19, 1953 in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]].&lt;ref name="McG55"/&gt;  

Their marriage had problems. Schickel wrote, "He thought they were too young, not well enough established."&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Actress [[Mamie Van Doren]] later reported she met Eastwood on the set of ''[[Star in the Dust]]'' in the mid-1950s, during which they had an affair. She starred and he played an uncredited bit role.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/archive/chatter-vol-25-no-21|title=Chatter|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|first=Michael|last=Neill|date=May 26, 1986|access-date=June 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611020109/https://people.com/archive/chatter-vol-25-no-21/|archive-date=June 11, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Relationship with Roxanne Tunis===

In 1959 during the second season of ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', Eastwood began an ongoing affair (reportedly lasting 14 years&lt;ref name="makinghisday"/&gt;) with dancer and  stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis. She was also married yet separated. Their relationship resulted in Eastwood's earliest legal child, daughter Kimber Eastwood (born Kimber Tunis; June 17, 1964).&lt;ref name="McG139"&gt;McGilligan, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent2"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-1259606.html The Good, the Bad and the Ugly] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922150612/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-1259606.html |date=2017-09-22 }}. Young, Josh (May 4, 1997). ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Kimber's existence was kept secret from the public until July 1989, when the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' revealed her identity.&lt;ref name="McG455"&gt;McGilligan, p. 455&lt;/ref&gt; Her birth certificate does list Eastwood as the father, however.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; 

Biographer Marc Eliot wrote that Eastwood's wife Johnson may not have known about the baby at the time. "It is difficult to say for sure that she actually knew about the baby, although it would have been nearly impossible for her not to. Everyone on the set knew ... and it is simply too difficult to keep a secret like that when the mother and the illegitimate child live in the same small town, especially when that small town is Hollywood."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; The source for the 1989 ''Enquirer'' article that originally broke the story claimed Johnson was aware of Kimber's existence at all times and even met Roxanne Tunis in person when making an unannounced visit to the set of ''[[Breezy]]'' in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Clint's Bombshell Secret – He Has Illegitimate Daughter &amp; Grandson|first1=Mike|last1=Kerrigan|first2=Brian|last2=Williams|date= July 11, 1989|work=National Enquirer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actress [[Barbara Eden]], a onetime ''Rawhide'' guest star and witness to the affair with Tunis, said Eastwood and Johnson "...conducted a somewhat [[open marriage]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eden|first=Barbara|title=Jeannie Out of the Bottle|year=2011|publisher=Crown Archetype|isbn=0307886956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other affairs and reconciliation ===

Ria Brown, the biographer of competitive swimmer Anita Lhoest, claims Lhoest terminated a pregnancy by Eastwood without consulting him at one point during their late 1950s to early 1960s affair.&lt;ref&gt;From unpublished manuscript ''Take Ten'' (The Life Story of Anita Lhoest) by Ria Brown, cited in Acknowledgements section of McGilligan biography&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Restaurant critic [[Gael Greene]] described an affair with Eastwood that started when she was assigned to interview him on the set of 1970's ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.net/clint-eastwood/news/food-critic-reveals-she-bedded-hunky-clint_10_02_2006|title=Food Critic Reveals She Bedded Hunky Clint|date=February 10, 2006|publisher=|access-date=January 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110160814/http://www.contactmusic.net/clint-eastwood/news/food-critic-reveals-she-bedded-hunky-clint_10_02_2006|archive-date=January 10, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fling with French model Cathy Reghin around the same time was one of his few extramarital involvements to receive press coverage of any kind during the fact. According to McGilligan, Eastwood had many other affairs, including with co-stars [[Inger Stevens]]&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[Hang 'Em High]]''), [[Jean Seberg]]&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[Paint Your Wagon (film)|Paint Your Wagon]]'') and [[Jo Ann Harris]]&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[The Beguiled (1971 film)|The Beguiled]]''), as well as actresses [[Jill Banner]],&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catherine Deneuve]]&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Susan St. James]],&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; columnist Bridget Byrne&lt;ref name="McGilligan, p. 228"&gt;McGilligan, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; and singer [[Keely Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; while married to Johnson, who, after a [[trial separation]] and lingering bout of [[hepatitis]] during the mid-1960s, expressed desire to reconcile and start a family.&lt;ref name="McGilligan, p. 228"/&gt; They had two children together: [[Kyle Eastwood]] (born May 19, 1968) and [[Alison Eastwood]] (born May 22, 1972).&lt;ref name="McG484"&gt;McGilligan, p. 484&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with Sondra Locke ==
In 1972, Eastwood met married actress (later director) [[Sondra Locke]] at a meeting in his office on the [[Universal Studios Lot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Brien |first=Daniel |title=Clint Eastwood: Film-Maker |publisher=B. T. Batsford |year=1996 |isbn=0-7134-7839-X |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two began living together while filming ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' in [[Page, Arizona]] in October 1975,&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; by which time, according to Locke, "He had told me that there was no real relationship left between him and Maggie."&lt;ref name="autobio"&gt;{{cite book|last=Locke|first=Sondra|title= The Good, the Bad, and the Very Ugly – A Hollywood Journey|publisher= [[William Morrow and Company]]|year= 1997|ISBN=978-0-688-15462-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locke wrote in her autobiography, "Clint seemed astonished at his need for me, even admitting that he'd never been faithful to one woman — because he'd "never been in love before," he confided. He even made up a song about it: "She made me monogamous." That flattered and delighted me. I would never doubt his faithfulness and his love for me."&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; 

After ''Josey'' wrapped, Locke moved into the [[Sherman Oaks]] house Eastwood had once shared with Johnson (who by then lived full-time in [[Pebble Beach]]&lt;ref name="McGilligan, p. 288"&gt;McGilligan, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;), but felt uncomfortable there because "psychologically, it would always be Maggie's."&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; "Finally I told Clint that I couldn't live there any longer," writes Locke.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; The couple moved to [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel-Air]] in a [[fixer-upper]] that took three years to renovate.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim they shuttled between homes in [[Tiburon, California]] and [[Sun Valley, Idaho]], as well as the [[Rising River Ranch]] which Eastwood bought from [[Bing Crosby]]'s estate.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; Locke had two abortions and then a [[tubal ligation]] during the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; She was quite reluctant to have the second abortion. She later said, "I couldn't help but think that that baby, with both Clint's and my best qualities, would be extraordinary."&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; Johnson made no secret of her dislike for Locke, even though the two women never met. "Maggie placed severe rules on my relationship with the kids. Apparently, she never forgave me ... After she learned that Clint had taken me onto her property to show me a baby deer that had just been born there, she laid down a rule that I was never to be allowed there again. I was not even allowed to phone the Pebble Beach house."&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;

=== Divorce from Johnson ===

In 1978 Johnson filed for [[legal separation]] from Eastwood,&lt;ref name="McGilligan, p. 288"/&gt; but did not file for divorce until May 18, 1984,&lt;ref&gt;"Actor sued for divorce". ''Ukiah Daily Journal.'' Ukiah, California. May 20, 1984. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; a divorce which was finalized that November&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VPLK-J4C|title="California Divorce Index, 1966-1984," database, FamilySearch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Johnson receiving a straight cash payment reported to be between $25 and $30&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="McG348"&gt;McGilligan, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;
Locke never divorced her legal husband, sculptor Gordon Anderson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PBPB&amp;p_theme=pbpb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF82D6894FA344&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id|title=Locke Married?|work=[[The Palm Beach Post]]|date=May 9, 1989|accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="annonline.com"&gt;[http://www.annonline.com/interviews/971111/biography.html "Locke Biography"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707145247/http://www.annonline.com/interviews/971111/biography.html |date=July 7, 2011 }}, annoline.com; retrieved October 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; who was gay and resided with his partner in a [[West Hollywood]] home purchased by Eastwood.&lt;ref name="independent2" /&gt;

Eastwood and Locke went on to star in ''[[The Gauntlet (film)|The Gauntlet]]'', ''[[Every Which Way But Loose (film)|Every Which Way But Loose]]'', ''[[Bronco Billy]]'', ''[[Any Which Way You Can]]'' and ''[[Sudden Impact]]''. According to former longtime associate Fritz Manes, as quoted by author McGilligan, Eastwood was devoted to her between 1976 and 1980 at the least, but discreetly kept up several "maintenance relationships" (such as with Tunis&lt;ref name="McG353"&gt;McGilligan, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;) during that period.

===Affairs with Jacelyn Reeves and others===

McGilligan claims Eastwood returned to his "habitual womanizing" in the early 1980s, becoming involved with story analyst Megan Rose,&lt;ref name="McG353"/&gt; actress [[Jamie Rose]]&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; (who played a bit part in ''[[Tightrope (film)|Tightrope]]''), animal rights activist Jane Brolin (who had intermittent liaisons with Eastwood between the early 1960s and late 1980s&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 457&lt;/ref&gt;), and Jacelyn Reeves, a Hawaii-based stewardess he met at the Hog's Breath Inn, among others. 

=== Children with Reeves  ===

He was still living with Locke when he conceived two children with Reeves:&lt;ref name="parade-jacelyn"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.parade.com/celebrity/2008/12/clint-eastwood.html |title= Clint Eastwood After 70| work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]] | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121114101721/http://www.parade.com/celebrity/2008/12/clint-eastwood.html | archivedate= November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; son [[Scott Eastwood]] (born Scott Reeves; March 21, 1986)&lt;ref name="Eliot226"&gt;Eliot, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/scott-eastwood-interview-how-clints-son-bounced-back-after-being-rejected-for-role-in-fathers-film-10314191.html |title=Scott Eastwood interview: How Clint's son bounced back after being rejected for role in 'American Sniper'|first=Tom |last=Teodorczuk |date=June 12, 2015 |accessdate= April 11, 2015|work=[[The Independent]] | location =UK|archivedate= January 30, 2016| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160130160216/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/scott-eastwood-interview-how-clints-son-bounced-back-after-being-rejected-for-role-in-fathers-film-10314191.html | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and daughter Kathryn Eastwood (born Kathryn Reeves; February 2, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  The birth certificates for both children said "Father declined",&lt;ref name="Eliot252"&gt;Eliot, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; and the affair with Reeves was not reported anywhere until an [[Exposé (journalism)|exposé]] article was published in the ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]'' tabloid in 1990.&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Clint Eastwood's Secret 4-Year Love Comes Out of Hiding|first1=Bob|last1=Smith|first2=Stephen|last2=Viens|date= February 27, 1990|work=[[Star (magazine)|Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McG370"&gt;McGilligan, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; Reeves reportedly stated, "Some family members tell me to file a paternity suit against Clint, but I don't want to."&lt;ref name="star"/&gt; The children were not reported by mainstream news sources up until the mid-2000s.&lt;ref&gt;The Reeves children are not included in the count, for instance, at {{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20143212,00.html|title=Passages|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|first=Jeremy|last=Helligar|date=January 13, 1997|accessdate=March 25, 2014|quote=News anchor Dina Ruiz, 31, more than made husband Clint Eastwood's day when she gave birth to the couple's first child, an 8-lb. 4-oz. girl named Morgan, on Dec. 12 in Los Angeles.

=== Breakup with Locke ===

Eastwood's relationship with Locke (at the time, unaware of his infidelities&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;) ended acrimoniously in April 1989, and the post-breakup litigation dragged on for a decade. Locke filed a [[palimony]] lawsuit against him after he changed the locks on their home and moved her possessions into storage when she was at work filming her second directorial feature, ''[[Impulse (1990 film)|Impulse]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/archive/cover-story-after-the-loving-counting-the-cost-vol-32-no-6|title=When Harry Left Sondra|date=7 August 1989|work=People|access-date=1 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180526185824/https://people.com/archive/cover-story-after-the-loving-counting-the-cost-vol-32-no-6/|archive-date=26 May 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In court, Eastwood [[Minimisation (psychology)|downplayed]] the intensity of their relationship. He described Locke as a "roommate" before quickly redescribing her as a "part-time roommate."&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; Locke's estranged brother told ''[[The Tennessean]]'' that Eastwood still truly loved her, but could no longer take her "addiction" to husband Gordon Anderson.&lt;ref name="Tennessean"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slaughter|first=Sylvia|title=Sondra vs. Clint in palimony suit|journal=The Tennessean|date=May 28, 1989|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/113567847/|access-date=July 2, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818232812/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/113567847/|archive-date=August 18, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Anticipating that Eastwood was going to misrepresent her marriage to Anderson, Locke asked Anderson to surrender all claims on any of her assets which as her legal spouse he was entitled to.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; "In an extraordinary gesture of love and faith in me, Gordon signed away everything without hesitation."&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; During the trial, an investigative journalist contacted Locke and informed her of Eastwood's other family. "I spoke with the nurse in the delivery room, and she confirmed that they are Clint's children. I'll send copies of the birth certificates to you and a photo of Jacelyn, if you want them," Locke quotes the informant.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; "My mind was still searching to get all his actions lined up. For at least the last four years, Clint had been living this double life, going between me and this other woman, and ''having children with her''. Two babies had been born during the last three years of our relationship, and they weren't mine."&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;

As the case went on, Locke developed breast cancer and said the treatments sapped her will to fight.&lt;ref name="independent2" /&gt; She dropped her suit in November 1990 in exchange for a settlement package that included a lump sum plus monthly payments from Eastwood and a $1.5 million directing deal at Warner Bros.,&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; but sued him again for [[fraud]] in 1995 when she became convinced the deal was a sham,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/33559/eastwood-s-ex-lover-says-he-torpedoed-her-career|title=Eastwood's Ex-Lover Says He Torpedoed Her Career|work=E!

''Chicago Sun-Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other female companions during 1989 included Carmel mayor Jean Grace, actress Dani Crayne and model [[Barbara Minty]], widow of [[Steve McQueen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moser|first=Margaret|title=Movie Stars Do the Dumbest Things|date=2011|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=1429978376|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Daughter with Frances Fisher ==
[[File:Clint and Dina Eastwood.jpg|thumb|right|With his (now former) wife [[Dina Eastwood|Dina]] in 2007]]
In the autumn of 1990, actress [[Frances Fisher]], whom Eastwood had met on the set of ''[[Pink Cadillac (film)|Pink Cadillac]]'' two years prior,&lt;ref name="McG434"&gt;McGilligan, p. 434&lt;/ref&gt; moved in with him. Fisher said of dating Eastwood, "I simply felt that this was it, the big one.

Eastwood and Fisher ended their relationship in January 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-09-15/entertainment/ca-46085_1_frances-fisher|title=How's Life After Clint?

== Marriage and divorce with Dina Ruiz==

Before Fisher had moved out of Eastwood's home, he was reportedly already dating [[Dina Eastwood|Dina Ruiz]],&lt;ref name="makinghisday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20103280,00.html|title=Making His Day – Vol. 45 No. 15|date=April 15, 1996|publisher=|access-date=April 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805213436/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20103280,00.html|archive-date=August 5, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;a television news anchor 35 years his junior whom he had first met when she interviewed him in April 1993.&lt;ref name="Eliot289" /&gt; They married on March 31, 1996, when Eastwood surprised her with a private ceremony at a home on the [[Shadow Creek Golf Course]] in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Reuters]]|title=Clint's wife expecting|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/doc/437533223.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=September 6, 1996|accessdate=March 7, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528032037/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/doc/437533223.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current|archive-date=May 28, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was noted for the fact that it was only Eastwood's second legal union in spite of his many long-term romances over the decades. Eastwood said of his bride, "I'm proud to make this lady my wife. She's the one I've been waiting for."&lt;ref name="McG513"&gt;McGilligan, p. 513&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ruiz commented, "The fact that I'm only the second woman he has married really touches me."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; The couple has one daughter, Morgan Eastwood (born December 12, 1996).&lt;ref name="McG328"&gt;McGilligan, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; Ruiz made cameos in two of Eastwood's films, ''[[Blood Work (film)|Blood Work]]'' and ''[[True Crime (1999 film)|True Crime]]'' (in which Fisher even appeared). In the summer of 2012, Dina, Morgan and Francesca starred with the band [[Overtone (musical group)|Overtone]] in a reality show for the ''[[E!]]'' network titled ''[[Mrs. Eastwood &amp; Company]]'', on which Clint appeared only occasionally.

In August 2013, Dina Eastwood announced that she and her husband had been living separately for an undisclosed length of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/clint-eastwood-wife-dina-eastwood-separate-after-nearly-17-years-of-marriage-2013298|date=August 29, 2013|title=Clint Eastwood, Wife Dina Eastwood Separate After Nearly 17 Years of Marriage|first=Allison|last=Takeda|work=[[Us Weekly]]|accessdate=August 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831093651/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/clint-eastwood-wife-dina-eastwood-separate-after-nearly-17-years-of-marriage-2013298|archive-date=August 31, 2013|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 23, 2013, Dina filed for divorce after she withdrew her request for legal separation, citing [[irreconcilable differences]].

'''Solomon Grundy''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], usually depicted as a [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]] and an [[antihero]] in the [[DC animated universe]]. He was originally depicted as a murder victim brought back to life as a [[wikt:corporeal|corporeal]] [[revenant]] or [[zombie]], though subsequent versions of the character have occasionally depicted a different origin. Named after [[Solomon Grundy|the 19th century nursery rhyme]], Grundy was introduced as an enemy of [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] comic book hero [[Alan Scott]] (the original [[Green Lantern]]), but has since become a prominent enemy for a number of superheroes such as [[Superman]] and [[Batman]]. He also has ties to [[Swamp Thing]].

==== Earth-Two version's history ====
[[File:All American Comics 61.jpg|The cover to ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #61, by Paul Reinman.|thumb|left]]
In the late 19th century, a wealthy merchant named Cyrus Gold is murdered and his body is disposed of in Slaughter Swamp, near [[Gotham City]]. Fifty years later, the corpse is reanimated as a huge shambling figure (composed partly of the [[swamp]] matter that has accumulated around the body over the decades) with almost no memory of its past life. Gold murders two escaped criminals who are hiding out in the marsh and steals their clothes. He shows up in a [[hobo]] camp and, when asked about his name, one of the few things he can recall is that he was "born on a Monday". One of the men at the camp mentions the nursery rhyme character [[Solomon Grundy]] (who was born on a Monday), and Gold adopts the moniker.

Strong, vicious, and nearly mindless, Solomon Grundy falls into a life of crime—or perhaps returns to one, as his scattered residual memories may indicate—attracting the attention of the Green Lantern, [[Alan Scott]]. Grundy proves to be a difficult opponent, unkillable (since he is already dead) and with an inherent resistance to Scott's powers (which cannot affect [[wood]], a substance of which Grundy's reassembled body is now largely composed). He apparently kills Green Lantern, who gives off a green flash. Liking this flash, Grundy commits murders hoping to see the flash again. However the first fight ends when, engaging in fisticuffs with the monster because of the ineffectiveness of his ring, Grundy is hurled under a [[train]] by Green Lantern.

Grundy is revived when a criminal scientist, known as the [[Professor]], injects Grundy with concentrated chlorophyll. After this second encounter, Grundy is trapped in a green plasma bubble for a time, until a freak weather occurrence releases him from his prison. Making his way across country, Grundy heads for the headquarters of the [[Justice Society of America]]. Green Lantern arrives early for the meeting and when the other members arrive, they find their headquarters smashed to pieces and Green Lantern missing from the ranks. Johnny turns on the radio, which blares the warning that Solomon Grundy is on the loose; the members believe, based on a large, muddy footprint on the floor, that Grundy got to HQ and took Green Lantern. The radio continues its report, listing cities where Grundy was seen, so each member picks a city and heads for it (Wonder Woman staying behind) to try to find Green Lantern. The scene now shifts back to the moment at JSA HQ where Green Lantern had opened the door. To his surprise, Doiby Dickles walks in, and informs him that Grundy has freed himself and is on the loose. Green Lantern leaves immediately, hoping to find Grundy before any of the JSA members are hurt going after him. Minutes later, Grundy arrives at JSA HQ, and, not finding the Lantern there, he smashes the place up, then leaves. Green Lantern and Doiby use a special radio-like device Alan Scott had developed that is attuned to the mental wavelengths of Grundy himself; Green Lantern calculates the path of Grundy and announces over the radio in JSA HQ where Grundy will strike. When Green Lantern and Grundy meet, Grundy rips a tree out by its roots and smashes it into the Lantern. Green Lantern fights back with his power ring and fists until both men fall into a nearby stream and over a small waterfall. The Lantern is severely dazed and tries to ward off Grundy with his ring, but he is much too weak. Grundy grabs Green Lantern by the throat and begins to squeeze the life out of him, holding his head underwater. However, Hawkman strikes Grundy with his mace, and Mid-Nite is able to revive the Lantern. A combined attack brings down Grundy, and Green Lantern deposits Grundy on the moon.

A battle soon commences when Grundy's body gravitates towards young astronomer Dick Cashmere as he learns to ride light waves, resulting in his assuming Cashmere's identity for a time while leaving the real one bound and gagged, though the Society finds him soon after. In this incarnation he gains intelligence, which he subsequently loses when Green Lantern defeats and buries Grundy in 1947.

At this point, he is pulled back to 1941 by the time-traveling criminal [[Per Degaton]], who has enlisted the aid of several supervillains to capture the Justice Society of America on December 7, 1941 (the day of the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]]), hoping to change history enabling him to take over the world though he does not want the heroes involved, and tells Grundy he will be able to destroy Green Lantern. However, Degaton is planning to get rid of him once his plan succeeds. He encountered Green Lantern, the Flash, and Wonder Woman in Echo Park. None of the heroes have fought Grundy yet the villain claims to have fought them before. Grundy bests the costumed trio and is summoned by a mysterious voice to deliver them or "pay the penalty". The [[All-Star Squadron]] comes to their rescue, [[Shining Knight#Sir Justin|Sir Justin]] faces off against Solomon Grundy and Grundy is the last villain to be transported back, he is thrust back to the moon where he remains for over two decades, as this timeline is erased once Degaton is defeated.

Grundy eventually masters the use of stored up emerald energy he has absorbed over the years from his several battles with his arch-foe, and returns to Earth to battle Green Lantern, [[Hourman]], and [[Doctor Fate]]. At this point, he has temporary mastery over all wooden objects. He subsequently loses this power over time. He is imprisoned in a bubble in space made by Green Lantern and Doctor Fate.

He was once pulled to Earth-1 and substituted for the superstrong [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] due to a machine that was accidentally pulling the Earths together in warp-space and substituting people. During this event he had absorbed some of Dr Fate's magic, is stronger than before, and is even able to telekinetically lift the Flash into the air. He hates Green Lantern so much he thinks everyone he sees is Green Lantern. He is imprisoned inside a mountain by Earth-1 Green Lantern after being lifted up by Earth-1 [[Hawkman]] and dazed by blows from all the heroes, but when the machine is turned off he is substituted for Blockbuster on Earth-2 and renews the attack, defeating numerous heroes. However the JSA and JLA went to battle an Anti-Matter being that was threatening both Earths in Warp-Space after being summoned by Doctor Fate, who had sensed the threat due to the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]. To occupy the villains Green Lantern placed them together to occupy them, as the heroes return they find Grundy and Blockbuster have knocked the hate out of each other. He is then taken back to his Earth by the Justice Society.

He is briefly a member of the [[Injustice Society]] of the World. In the interim, he battles the combined might of both the Justice Society, and later their counterparts the [[Justice League]], nearly to a standstill at Slaughter Swamp, when he develops an affection for a lost alien child who has accidentally been sent to Earth-2 and is dying due to separation from his pet. His magic even enables him to defeat Superman. The alien child is finally reunited with his pet and sent back to his own dimension. Soon after, Grundy crosses over from his Slaughter Swamp prison on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-2]] to [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-1]] where he encounters that Earth's Superman (see more details below).

Grundy goes on to afflict Green Lantern and his teammates, including the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] who is the first female for whom he develops an affection. After Solomon Grundy is rescued from a [[glacier]] by Alan Scott's daughter, [[Jade (comics)|Jade]], Grundy becomes loyal to her and, for a while, is an ally of [[Infinity, Inc.]] Eventually, this affectionate relationship turns tragic as the villainous Marcie Cooper, a.k.a. [[Harlequin (comics)#Marcie Cooper|Harlequin]] of the [[Dummy (DC Comics)|Dummy]]'s Injustice Unlimited, uses her illusion powers to disguise herself as Jade. Harlequin manipulates Grundy to attack the members of Infinity Inc., one by one. She convinces him to press the unconscious [[Mister Bones]]' bare hand against [[Sylvester Pemberton|Skyman]]; since Bones's skin constantly exudes a [[cyanide]]-based compound, this quickly leads to Skyman's death. Once Grundy found out that Marcie had duped him, he savagely beat her within an inch of her life. This is the beginning of the end for Infinity Inc., and for Grundy's quasi-heroic career.

==== Earth-One version's history ====
The Earth-One Grundy arises when the [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] uses an enhanced crystal to [[metabolism|metabolically]] hasten the growth of residual cells left over in the sewers from when the original version had crossed over from Earth-2, which becomes a new, much more bestial version. During a clash with [[Superman]], it is determined that his might is too much for the Man of Steel, so Superman flies the monster to an alien world inhospitable to all save the hardiest life as the zombie propels himself through the air mimicking his one-time adversary.

This version repeatedly plagues Superman for years until, during an encounter wherein multiple Grundys are spawned, Superman and the [[Swamp Thing]] both encounter the [[cloning|clones]]. Soon, Superman obtains a compound from [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] which causes the Grundys to become inert, in effect killing the seemingly unkillable man-thing. Swamp Thing attempts to cry out for Superman to stop, as he believes Grundy to meet the definition of life, but Swamp Thing is unable to express this, due to physical difficulty in speaking. This version of Grundy returns one final time, without explanation, leading a gang in the Earth-One Gotham City. He is apparently destroyed yet again when [[Batman]] tricks the creature into a blast furnace, where it is apparently consumed by the flames.

This version of Grundy was retroactively erased from history after the revamping of Superman in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.

Grundy and a newly disfigured [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] striking up an odd friendship after Dent escapes the slaughterhouse to plot his revenge on [[Carmine Falcone]]. Grundy also appears early in the story while Batman pursues one of the suspects who bombed Dent's house into the sewers during [[Thanksgiving]]. Grundy attacks both of them, but Batman drives him off by blinding him with a shot of mace. Later, as a somewhat humorous twist in The Long Halloween, Batman provides Solomon Grundy with a Thanksgiving dinner.

After Infinity, Inc. disbands, Solomon Grundy loses his loyalty towards Jade. A clash with Alan Scott and Jade in the pages of ''[[Green Lantern Corps]] Quarterly'' ends with Grundy turning into a statue of petrified wood. The heroes believe the threat of Grundy to have ended once and for all, but they are mistaken. Shortly thereafter, Grundy reappears in Gotham in the pages of ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'', battling Batman once again and killing the female descendant of one of the killers of Cyrus Gold.

Grundy's next major appearance is in ''[[Starman (comics)|Starman]]'', lurking in [[Opal City]]'s sewers. [[Starman (Jack Knight)|Jack Knight]] befriends Grundy, who has become innocent and childlike. Grundy also becomes friends with previous Starman [[Mikaal Tomas]], and dies while sacrificing himself to save Jack Knight from being crushed by a collapsing building. When Grundy appears again, he has returned to his malicious persona; the joint efforts of Jack Knight, [[Batman]], Alan Scott, and [[Floronic Man|The Floronic Man]] are needed to stop him.

The origins of Grundy's [[resurrection]] come from the fact that the [[Parliament of Trees]], a high council of Plant [[Elemental]]s, tried to turn him into the newest Plant Elemental. However, the process was missing one vital piece: fire, as a Plant Elemental cannot be fully created unless it died in flames. Since Grundy's death did not involve fire at all, the process is not complete, and he becomes a sort of half-functional Plant Elemental. Grundy has been seemingly destroyed on several occasions, only to rise from the swamp again in a new incarnation. Each version of Grundy has been somewhat different from the last, depending on the medium used to dispatch him (and the drawing style of the current artist. The original Grundy, for example, had prominent front teeth). Some have been truly evil; some much less so. Some versions are more mindless than others; some are actually moderately intelligent, recalling the literate, well-spoken [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]] of [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]''.

Grundy hides out for a time in the Arrowcave, the long abandoned former headquarters of the Emerald Archer, [[Green Arrow]]. While searching for artifacts of his former life, Oliver and his former ward, [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy "Arsenal" Harper]], stumble onto Grundy's new hideout. The story, "Grundy No Like Arrows in the Face!", is found in ''Green Arrow'' (vol. 3) #18. Green Arrow notes that this version seems much more violent, and manages to kill him by choking him with the string to his broken bow (despite the fact that Grundy does not have a heartbeat, functional veins, or need to breathe). In ''Green Arrow'' (vol. 3) #53, "Solomon's Revenge", Green Arrow helps Dr. Chrissie Cavendish, a [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] employee, who claims she is the great, great granddaughter of the man the monster spawned from, to find and cure him. Her cure warps her into a monster much worse than Grundy. Green Arrow subdues the new monster, and leaves Grundy be. It is not known if Grundy is still using this building.

=== Seven Soldiers of Victory ===
In the first issue of Grant Morrison's ''[[Seven Soldiers of Victory]]'', Issue #0 of the same name, one of the Seven Unknown Men of Slaughter Swamp recounts the death of the miserly pedophile, Cyrus Gold, killed at the hands of an enraged mob, but also mentions that Gold could just as easily have been the innocent victim of a misunderstanding, as Slaughter Swamp is a point in space where time means nothing. In the final issue – ''Seven Soldiers #1'' – the same Unknown Man punishes another of his group – the Eighth Man, Zor – by dressing him in Cyrus Gold's clothing and leaving him for the mob to find, implying that Zor – an extremely vain character, notable for attempting several times to overthrow the Universe and for having defeated [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|The Spectre]] – would later become the first Solomon Grundy.

=== Infinite Crisis ===
Prior to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Grundy is manipulated by [[Gorilla Grodd]] via mind control into attacking Batman and Superman for [[Lex Luthor|President Luthor]] for the bounty of one billion dollars in ''[[Superman/Batman]]''. Batman is able to stop Grundy. While no specifics are given, Solomon Grundy is also coerced into joining the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. He participates in the final strike against the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. [[Rag Doll (comics)|Ragdoll II]] encounters Grundy in a doorway. Ragdoll's scarred face relates to Grundy, and Grundy goes on to turn against the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]. The aftermath of that battle is inconclusive, but Grundy evidently survives, as he was last seen in a murky swamp in ''JSA Classified''. In it, he is convinced by [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]] to help [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard]], who is in trouble.

After helping Icicle free [[Johnny Sorrow]] from [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus']] cosmic key, Grundy stays with the newly formed [[Injustice Society]].

In ''Infinite Crisis'' #7, Solomon Grundy is seen fighting against the [[Blood Pack (comics)|Blood Pack]] in the Battle of Metropolis, until he is vaporized by [[Superman-Prime|Superboy-Prime]]'s heat vision, which apparently kills the Blood Pack and destroys Grundy's current incarnation.

=== The Tornado's Path ===
In [[Brad Meltzer]]'s ''Justice League of America'', Grundy is reborn with intelligence after being killed in the Battle of Metropolis.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League America'' (vol. 2) #1-4 (October 2006 – January 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; He is revealed to be the mastermind behind the abduction of [[Red Tornado]]'s robot body (it is revealed he gained this intelligence when he was reborn after being burned by Prime). Grundy expresses a desire to stop his cycle of dying and being reborn and so it appears he enlists the help of Professor Ivo to build him an [[Amazo]] body to live in forever. The Red Tornado kills Grundy with [[Fujita scale|F5]] tornado winds, ripping him apart.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League America'' (vol. 2) #5-6 (February–April 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

He later appears in the ''[[Salvation Run]]'' mini-series in which he is killed during a battle with [[Parademon]]s. His body, awaiting its inevitable resurrection, is left behind when the villains leave the Hell Planet. However, when the villains exit, Grundy's hand trembles, accompanied with a groaning sound.

=== Blackest Night ===
In the one-shot ''Faces of Evil: Solomon Grundy'' (March 2009) by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Scott Kolins]], Cyrus Gold returns to life in Slaughter Swamp, as he was prior to becoming Grundy. He returns to Gotham City, but is shot by police after attacking a charity worker. In the police morgue, he transforms into Solomon Grundy. Grundy is once more an unintelligent monster, repeating the opening line of the nursery rhyme. A week later, having retreated to the sewers, he has a fight with [[Killer Croc]]. At the end of the fight, exhausted, he reverts to Cyrus Gold again. He finds himself in front of his own grave, where the [[Phantom Stranger]] tells him he has seven days to undo his curse, as "There is an unholy night coming, as black as the dead's blood. And it's best if Solomon Grundy was not around for it." (A reference to the upcoming ''[[Green Lantern: The Blackest Night|Blackest Night]]'' storyline.)&lt;ref&gt;''Faces of Evil: Solomon Grundy'' #1 (March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Scott serves as his reluctant guide, as the story continues in the ''Solomon Grundy'' miniseries.

In the count down to Blackest Night, Cyrus Gold was given one week to discover the truth of who murdered him, so he could repent for all of his sins and gain absolution. Alan Scott and the Phantom Stranger were given as his guides throughout the week, while [[Etrigan]] was trying to take him to [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]]. Gold had a habit of getting killed. No matter how much damage was done to his body, he resurrected as a complete Solomon Grundy, driven to kill. Eventually it is revealed that Gold committed suicide, meaning he forced the curse of Solomon Grundy on himself. At the end of the series' run we see Grundy reanimated as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]], and Cyrus Gold in hell.&lt;ref&gt;''Solomon Grundy'' #1-6 (May–October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Grundy then tracks down and attacks [[Bizarro]], using a past friendship they had to stir up the creature's emotions.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Batman'' #66 (January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Bizarro eventually manages to defeat Grundy by flying him into the sun, which completely incinerates him, and the black ring.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Batman'' #67 (February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The New 52 ===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Grundy is once again a villain for Alan Scott. First appearing in ''[[Earth-Two|Earth 2]]'' #3, Grundy personifies "The Grey" life-destroying forces and opposes "The Green" forces that choose Alan Scott as their champion. He attacks Washington DC to get Alan's attention. [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Flash]], [[Hawkgirl]], and Green Lantern fight him, but [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Atom]] brings him down temporarily by jumping onto him at giant size. The battle continues until Scott once again exiles Grundy to the moon where neither he nor the "Grey" can do any damage.&lt;ref&gt;''Earth 2'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually Grundy's origin was revealed: a slaughterhouse worker in 1898, his wife was raped by his callous foreman, and she killed herself on the job. When the foreman made the workers feed the body to the crocodiles, Grundy snapped, killed his foreman and everyone else in the slaughterhouse, then committed suicide, but apparently something happened immediately afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;''Earth 2'' #15.2: Solomon Grundy&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DC Rebirth ===
The Prime-Earth Solomon Grundy is introduced in ''[[DC Rebirth]]''. His appearance resembles that of his pre-Flashpoint depictions. Solomon Grundy is pursued by Batman and Gotham in Gotham City before the former incapacitates him. Grundy recites the Solomon Grundy nursery rhyme while being pursued before Batman finished it for him when he defeats Grundy.&lt;ref&gt;'''Batman''' Vol. 3 #2&lt;/ref&gt;

During "The War of Jokes and Riddles" arc, Solomon Grundy is among the villains on Joker's side in his war against Riddler.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' Vol. 3 #28. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Powers and abilities ==
Solomon Grundy has superhuman strength and stamina. His strength has varied greatly through the years; for instance, in the Long Halloween story arc, Batman beat Grundy, while at various points his strength is roughly on par with Superman's. He is virtually indestructible and immortal thanks to the elemental energy that imbues his form with pseudo-life. He is nearly invulnerable to physical, magical, and energy attacks and he is not affected by fire or low temperatures. He has proven highly resistant to the effects of the [[Alan Scott|original Green Lantern]]'s power ring (which is attributed to his part-plant essence; originally because he had absorbed plant matter from the swamp, and later because he was a partial "plant elemental" like [[Swamp Thing]]).

Grundy possesses a healing factor.&lt;ref&gt;Secret Six: Six Degrees of Devastation&lt;/ref&gt; While he has occasionally been destroyed, he has always returned to life sooner or later, though often with different personalities and powers.

When it came to ''The New 52'', the Earth-2 Solomon Grundy also possesses powers associated with The Grey.

== Other versions ==
=== Anti-Matter Earth Post-Crisis version ===
Solomon Grundy had a counterpart on the [[Crime Syndicate of America]]'s Earth called '''Sir Solomon Grundy''' who was a member of Quizmaster's [[Secret Society of Super Villains#Justice Underground|Justice Underground]]. Sir Solomon Grundy is a distinguished, poised mountain of a man. During an aerial bombardment of Dover, he is blasted to life out of the rock from the [[White cliffs of Dover|white cliffs]]. Sir Solomon appears to be identical in physical appearance to the mainstream Solomon Grundy with the exception of a trimmed mustache and a small goatee. In keeping with his educated personality, Sir Solomon dresses himself as a 19th-century Englishman would, and speaks accordingly. His super strength and invulnerability made him a formidable hero, until [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]] renders him inert on a Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA Secret Files and Origins 2004''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amalgam Comics ===

==== Live-action ====
* Solomon Grundy also appears in the 1979 live action TV special ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'', portrayed by actor [[Mickey Morton]].
* Solomon Grundy makes a cameo appearance in the tenth and final season of ''[[Smallville]]'' portrayed by [[John DeSantis]]. A member of [[Toyman]]'s [[Legion of Doom|Marionette Ventures]], he appears in the episode "Prophecy" where Toyman assigns him to target [[Black Canary]].
* Cyrus Gold appears in the second season of [[The CW]]'s ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' nicknamed "Solomon Grundy" by [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]], portrayed by Graham Shiels. He makes his first appearance in the episode "State v. Queen", where he is addressed by the name Brother Cyrus, and is shown to be the lone survivor of an experiment conducted by [[Brother Blood]] injecting him with a serum called Mirakuru. It was created by the Japanese during [[World War II]] in hopes of creating an army of super soldiers. The serum causes increased strength and rapid cell regeneration, granting Gold superhuman strength and durability. In "The Scientist", acting on Blood's orders, Cyrus (wearing a helmet as '''The Acolyte''') is tasked with stealing state of the art technology from [[Queen Industries|Queen Consolidated]]'s Applied Sciences division, but is thwarted by the [[Green Arrow|Arrow]], who is later seriously injured. In "Three Ghosts", it's revealed that the tech Gold stole was to mass-produce the Mirakuru. Oliver tracks him down once again, this time shooting a machine next to Cyrus with an arrow, causing it to explode and spew acid all over Cyrus' face and torso, seemingly killing him. As reference to the comics in Cyrus Gold's apartment, Diggle finds a book containing a poem on Solomon Grundy, a reference to the cycle of life. Oliver recites "Died on Saturday; buried on Sunday".
* Solomon Grundy appears on Fox's ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', portrayed by [[Drew Powell]]. He is introduced under the name '''Butch Gilzean''', a mob enforcer working for [[Fish Mooney]]. Throughout the first three seasons, Gilzean works for various villains, including [[Penguin (character)|Oswald Cobblepot / Penguin]], [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Tabitha Galavan / Tigress]], and [[James Gordon (comics)#Barbara Eileen Gordon|Barbara Kean]]. In the [[Gotham (season 3)|third season]] finale, he is shot in the head by Kean after attempting to betray her. The doctors examining Gilzean's body reveal that Butch Gilzean was an alias, and that his birth name is Cyrus Gold. Gold becomes Solomon Grundy in the [[Gotham (season 4)|fourth season]] episode "The Blade's Path", in which the administrators of the hospital dump him in Slaughter Swamp, where chemical waste from the Indian Hill facility transform him into a pale, zombie-like creature with regenerative abilities and superhuman strength. Suffering amnesia from his head wound, Gold adopts the name "Solomon Grundy", based on the nursery rhyme, when he hears the name on a record played by people living on the street. He is discovered by Edward Nygma, who recruits him as muscle. After Tabitha Galavan manages to jog his memory, Solomon Grundy remembers who he is and briefly visits Tabitha. Grundy later forms an alliance with Oswald, who promises to help find a way to reverse his condition and return to him as Butch.

==== Animated ====
* Solomon Grundy appears in ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'' voiced by [[Jimmy Weldon]] in a [[Southern United States|southern]] [[Accent (dialect)|accent]]. He is a member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Legion of Doom]]. In this cartoon series, Grundy speaks broken English. This incarnation of Grundy is arguably one of the more "intelligent" versions of the character as he is able to carry on a conversation and devise plans of his own. In "Monolith of Evil", Grundy reveals he was brought back to life in the swamp by energy from a monolith which is a source of enormous power.
* Solomon Grundy appears in the ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'' animated series, voiced again by Jimmy Weldon. In the episode "Revenge of Doom", he and the rest of the Legion of Doom get back together after salvaging the Legion of Doom headquarters from the swamp.
* Solomon Grundy appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Mark Hamill]] (in the former series) and by [[Bruce Timm]] (in the latter series). This version's origin was that of a mobster (also named Cyrus Gold) who eventually crossed the wrong people. He was killed, cursed, then dumped in a mystical swamp, rising again 25 years later as a soulless monster, forever seeking his lost soul without being aware of it. He is often paired with [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]] to [[comedic]] timing in various episodes and a member of the [[Injustice Gang]] led by either [[Lex Luthor]] in "Injustice for All" and [[Fury (DC Comics)|Arseia]] in "Fury". In the episode "The Terror Beyond", Grundy became a more sympathetic figure, even a hero of sorts, by helping [[Doctor Fate]] save the world from a monstrous, bloodthirsty, [[Thanagar]]ian deity named Ichthultu (based on the [[H. P. Lovecraft]]ian [[Cthulhu]]) that he calls "Snake-Face". He befriends [[Hawkgirl]], calling her "Bird-Nose". Fate's team in the episode is a pastiche of Marvel's [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], with Grundy standing in for the [[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]], [[Aquaman]] standing in for [[Namor]], Doctor Fate standing in for [[Doctor Strange]], and Hawkgirl standing in for both [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] and [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]]. "Bird-Nose" was Hulk's nickname for Nighthawk, and other heroes have referred to him as such. Grundy often says "Grundy Crush!", a nod to the Hulk's popular catchphrase "Hulk Smash!" (to which Hawkgirl herself alludes with her own "Hawkgirl Smash"). Grundy attacks Ichthultu on his own, under the impression that the soul-devouring monster is in possession of his lost soul. He is poisoned in the attempt, but his efforts allow Hawkgirl to kill the monster. Even the normally staunch Hawkgirl weeps for him, and comforts him in his last moments, assuring him that his soul is waiting for him when he dies. His [[epitaph]] simply reads "Solomon Grundy — Born on a Monday", a reference to the poem after which he was named.
* Solomon would later return in the episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' series, "Wake the Dead" with his vocal effects provided by [[Bruce Timm]]. He is [[resurrection|resurrected]] by a dark spell cast by a group of young amateurs. The chaos magic used inadvertently infused him with the spirit of an unnamed powerful demon lord when the magic circle used to bind the demon in place was accidentally broken, allowing the demon to escape and possess Grundy's remains, with his memory of his past incarnation severely addled and lacking the ability to speak. Mindless and uncontrollable, he goes on a destructive rampage, his power augmented to levels far beyond his original self by the magic animating him. After a lengthy battle with the Justice League, he regains a small fraction of his memory when he beholds Shayera Hol, whom he has accepted as a friend, and he submits to Shayera who sorrowfully kills him offscreen to put him out of his misery.
* Solomon Grundy appeared in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Kevin Grevioux]]. This version is a zombie created by the working class citizens of 19th century [[Gotham City]] to wreak havoc on the rich landowners that polluted the local lake with [[industrial waste]] that converted it into Gotham Swamp, and is slimmer and more ghoulish than his ''Justice League'' counterpart — it bears a closer resemblance to an actually rotted, desiccated corpse — and he is more of a villain tied to Batman due to being 'born' in Gotham. As seen in the episode "Grundy's Night", the local legend had it that Grundy would again arise on a [[Halloween]] night when there was a total lunar eclipse in order to take revenge on the descendants of the rich landowners. Gotham City residents therefore referred to this Halloween as 'Grundy's Night', however, it was actually [[Clayface]] in disguise. Though at the end of the episode, something begins to rise out of the swamp as a moan is heard.
* Solomon Grundy appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]. This version is a still a zombie, but also a crime lord (a combination of the intelligent and incompetent versions) who commands a group of thugs, but speaks in grunts and growls due to his mouth being stitched together. He is also shown to have a right-hand man named Weasel that understands his orders. He fights against Batman and [[Black Canary]] in the teaser of "Night of the Huntress" where he tries to steal a scientist's brain. Black Canary defeats him by fooling him into falling through a glass roof atop a building. He reappears in "The Color of Revenge" robbing a bank in [[Bludhaven]]. [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] stops Grundy and the police take him away. He is also one of the villains summoned very briefly by [[Bat-Mite]] to test Batman's mettle in "Legends of the Dark Mite". He also appears in "[[Chill of the Night!]]" as one of the [[List of Batman Family enemies|Batman Villains]] to bid on a weapon auctioned by [[Joe Chill]]. Solomon is later seen in "The Knights of Tomorrow" being defeated by both Batman and Robin from the past and the future. He also appears in "Night of the Batmen" where he, [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], and [[Killer Croc]] try to steal a statue, but all four were stopped by [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] dressed as Batman. He was also seen in "Powerless" where he is one of the villains in a training simulator to help the depowered [[Captain Atom]] fight crime without powers were taken away by [[Major Force]]. Unfortunately, unable to defeat the simulation of Grundy. Solomon is also seen in the opening of "Crisis: 22,300 Miles Above Earth", as one of the villains at the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]'s [[celebrity roast]], where they were literally roasting Batman. He tried to make a joke about Batman, but was cut off by Joker due to his inability to speak clearly.
* Solomon Grundy appears in the fifth ''[[DC Nation Shorts|Super Best Friends Forever]]'' short, voiced by [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]]. When he begins rampaging the city, Supergirl, Batgirl, and Wonder Girl show up to stop him. He is reluctant to fight them because he says he does not fight girls, but when they defeat him, Grundy starts to reconsider fighting girls.
* Solomon Grundy appears in ''[[Justice League Action]]'', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. In the episode "Zombie King", he has obtained a gem that would enable him to summon zombies that would obey his every command. In addition, the zombies Solomon Grundy summons would turn anyone exposed to their gases into zombies as well. This plot was stumbled upon by Swamp-Thing who fights Solomon Grundy and his zombies in a New Orleans graveyard. In need of backup against Solomon Grundy and the zombies, Swamp-Thing calls Batman for help. As Swamp Thing and Batman fight Solomon Grundy's zombies as he places the gem into an alter in order to raise more zombies throughout the world, they soon are aided by Zatanna while John Constantine is busy fighting [[Brother Night]]. Even though Batman and Zatanna get converted into zombies, Swamp-Thing managed to break the alter and the gem enough for the zombified people to be returned to normal and the zombies to go inert. Then Swamp-Thing manages to defeat Solomon Grundy.

He is a [[boss battle]] and appears in the basement of the new Iceberg Lounge (which is located in the Cyrus Pinkney National History Institute) as the Penguin's "pet" who Cobblepot uses to kill his disloyal grunts. His origin story is related through several Arkham Stories: Solomon Grundy was once a merchant who was murdered and his body dumped in a mystic swamp. That night he was resurrected by combination of the swamp's mystic properties and a strange thunderstorm which turned him into the creature known as Solomon Grundy. He was found by a traveling circus and became part of the show before being found by [[Ra's al Ghul]], who realized that Grundy had actually been dumped in a [[Lazarus Pit]]. Ra's sought to understand the properties of the Lazarus Pit and its powers, and did so by repeatedly murdering Grundy, only for him to rise again and again. After Wonder City was shut down the Gotham forces sent to retrieve found Grundy, still in the building Ra's kept him in, waiting for Ra's to kill him again. Batman later confronts Grundy when Penguin blows up the floor under his feet. Awakened by being shocked with electricity, Grundy was revitalized and proceeded to attack.

When Sebastian's father came at him with a gun, Cyrus and Trigon broke into the house in their alter-egos as the Acolyte and the Devil and beat him.

'''Talia al Ghul''' ([[Arabic]]: تاليا الغول) is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], commonly in association with [[Batman]]. The character was created by writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artist [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]], and first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #411 (May 1971). Talia is the daughter of the [[supervillain]] [[Ra's al Ghul]], the half-sister of [[Nyssa Raatko]], [[romantic interest (theater)|on-and-off romantic interest]] of the [[superhero]] Batman, and the mother of [[Damian Wayne]] (the fifth [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]). She has alternately been depicted as an [[Antihero|anti-hero]].

Talia has appeared in over 500 individual comics issues,&lt;ref&gt;[http://katefatale.tumblr.com/masterlist Talia al Ghul appearances masterlist]. Retrieved 2012-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been featured in various media adaptions. The character was voiced by [[Helen Slater]] and [[Olivia Hussey]] in the [[DC Animated Universe]], which became her first appearances in media other than comic books. The character was subsequently portrayed by [[Marion Cotillard]] in the 2012 film ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', and [[Lexa Doig]] in the television series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''.

==Publication history==
The character was created by writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artist [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]] as simply '''Talia''' originally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 145 |quote = Before Batman first encountered one of his greatest adversaries, Ra's al Ghul, he met his daughter, the lovely but lethal Talia [in a story by] writer Denny O'Neil and artist Bob Brown.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character's creation and depiction was inspired by other works of fiction, such as the 1969 [[James Bond]] film ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', and the [[Fu Manchu]] fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Dennis|editor-last=O'Neil|editor-link=Dennis O'Neil|title = Batman Unauthorized: Vigilantes, Jokers, and Heroes in Gotham City|publisher=Smart Pop |year=2008 |page= 20 |quote = The mysterious Ra's al Ghul was introduced at this time as well, his daughter and Batman-love interest Talia and his Himalayan headquarters both directly inspired by the James Bond film ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Jeffery|editor-last=Klaehn|title = Inside the World of Comic Books|publisher=Black Rose Books |year=2006 |page= 129 |quote = [[Mike W.

"O’Neil combined the two women, added a touch of ''On Her Majestry’s Secret Service'', and viola, Ra’s al Ghul and Talia are born."&lt;/ref&gt; The character first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #411 (May 1971). She is most commonly depicted as a romantic interest for Batman, a villain, or a combination of the two. Her father, the leader of a worldwide criminal and terrorist empire, considered Batman the man most worthy to marry Talia and become his successor.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Villains Secret Files &amp; Origins'' #1 (1998). "'The Detective,' as Ra's al Ghul calls the Batman, is his most worthy opponent, and the one man most deserving of wedding his beautiful daughter Talia and inheriting the Demon's empire."&lt;/ref&gt; Absent a spouse, Talia was considered as an heir to her father and his organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Greenberger| first = Robert| authorlink = Robert Greenberger| title = The Essential Batman Encyclopedia| publisher = [[Del Rey Books]] | year = 2008| page = 179}} "Head, Talia.

"She is the daughter and sole heir of immortal international eco-terrorist Ra's al Ghul, the so-called 'Demon's Head.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Villains Secret Files and Origins'' (2005). "The siblings killed their father, only to discover that it was his plan all along to forge Nyssa into his successor. Nyssa and Talia now have all of Ras's empire under their control."&lt;/ref&gt; While Batman is uninterested in the criminal empire, he has often demonstrated romantic feelings for Talia.

Talia has saved the life of Batman or helped him on numerous occasions. The majority of her criminal acts have been committed at the behest of her father and motivated by loyalty to her father rather than personal gain. She had been depicted as morally ambiguous or an [[antihero]]ic figure.&lt;ref name=supermanencyc&gt;{{cite book| last = Greenberger| first = Robert| authorlink = Robert Greenberger| title = The Essential Superman Encyclopedia| publisher = [[Del Rey Books]] | year = 2010| pages = 117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid to late 90's part of her father's name was incorporated to hers as a kind of surname to help readers associate her with Ra's al Ghul. Recent depictions have shown her to be more often an enemy of Batman and a supervillain in her own right, such as leading the [[League of Assassins]],&lt;ref name="supermanencyc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Greenberger| first = Robert| authorlink = Robert Greenberger| title = The Essential Batman Encyclopedia| publisher = [[Del Rey Books]] | year = 2008| page = 180}} "Additionally, after Batgirl killed Nyssa, Talia took control of the League, setting herself up as one of the most dangerous people on Earth."&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]],&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Villains Secret Files and Origins'' (2005).

==Fictional character biography==

===Early years===
The first Talia comic story appears in "Into the Den of the Death-Dealers!" in ''Detective Comics'' #411 (May 1971), written by Dennis O'Neil. In the story, Batman rescues her from Dr. Darrk, apparently the leader of the [[League of Assassins]]. It is eventually revealed that the League is just one part of Ra's al Ghul's organization, The Demon, and that Darrk apparently turned against Ra's after failing in a mission (the usual punishment for this is death). At the end of the story, she shoots and kills Darrk to save Batman's life.

[[File:Talia al Ghul and Batman.png|thumb|upright|Talia and Batman share a kiss in ''Batman'' #244 (Sept. 1972). Art by Neal Adams and Dick Giordano.]]
Talia next appears in "Daughter of the Demon" in ''Batman'' #232 (June 1971). In the story, [[Robin (comics)#Dick Grayson|Dick Grayson]] (Robin) is kidnapped. Ra's al Ghul enters the [[Batcave]], revealing to Batman that he knows Batman's [[secret identity]] and saying that Talia was also kidnapped along with Dick. Batman then goes with Ra's to search for Dick and Talia; in the end, it is revealed that Talia loves Batman and that the entire kidnapping is a setup designed by Ra's as a final test of Batman's suitability to be Talia's husband and his successor. Though Batman rejects Ra's offer, he nevertheless returns Talia's feelings. Ra's and Talia consider Batman to be married to Talia with only their consent necessary in ''DC Special Series'' #15 (1978) in the story "I Now Pronounce You Batman and Wife!".&lt;ref name="Greenberger 2008 180"&gt;{{cite book| last = Greenberger| first = Robert| authorlink = Robert Greenberger| title = The Essential Batman Encyclopedia| publisher = [[Del Rey Books]] | year = 2008| page = 180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years since the character met Batman, Talia is repeatedly depicted as torn between loyalty to her father and her love of Batman. However, she has proven an important 'ally' in her way; most prominently, she encourages Batman to return to [[Gotham City]] when it is declared a "[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]" (1999) following an earthquake, and Batman had lost his fighting spirit and did not believe he ''could'' save Gotham.

===''Son of the Demon''===
In the graphic novel ''[[Batman: Son of the Demon|Son of the Demon]]'' (1987) by [[Mike W. Barr]], Ra's al Ghul successfully enlists Batman's aid in defeating a rogue assassin who had murdered his wife and Talia's mother, Melisande. Talia witnessed the murder as a young child. During this story line, Batman marries Talia and the prior marriage from ''DC Special Series'' #15 (1978) is referenced. They have conjugal relations which results in her becoming [[pregnant]]. Batman is nearly killed protecting Talia from an attack by the assassin's agents. In retrospect, Talia concludes that she could never keep Batman, as he would be continuously forced to defend her, so she fakes a [[miscarriage]], and the marriage is dissolved.

In later continuity, after Talia gives birth the child is left at an orphanage. He is adopted and given the name ''[[Ibn al Xu'ffasch]]'' which is Arabic for 'son of the bat'. The only other clue to the child's heritage is a jewel-encrusted necklace Batman had given to Talia which Talia leaves with the child.

It is referenced in three [[Elseworlds]] storylines: ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', its sequel ''[[The Kingdom (comics)|The Kingdom]],'' and ''Brotherhood of the Bat'' feature two alternate versions of the child as an adult, coming to terms with his dual heritage.

===''Birth of the Demon''===
The graphic novel ''Batman: Birth of the Demon'' (1992) by Dennis O'Neil explains how her father met her mother at [[Woodstock]] and that she was of [[Arab]] descent. Talia's mother later dies of a drug overdose in this story.

===Bane===
After Bane enters the League of Assassins, Ra's considers Bane a potential heir to his empire instead of Batman and wants his daughter to marry him.Talia later rejects the brute, regarding him as merely a cunning animal compared to the more cultured intelligence of his predecessor. After Batman defeats Bane in the ''[[Batman: Legacy|Legacy]]'' comic series (1996), Ra's agrees that Bane was unworthy of his daughter (''Detective Comics'' #701 and ''Robin'' #33), and calls off their engagement. Following ''Legacy'', Bane has a nightmare in ''Batman: Bane'' (1997) of Talia (presumed to be deceased) betraying him and stabbing him and then embracing Batman. In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #26 (2001), written by Dixon, Bane continues to express his obsession with Talia. At the end of the story, Talia is pleased at the supposed death of Bane in one of her father's underground sanctums.

===LexCorp===
The Talia character was written to begin a new phase of her fictional life near the turn of the century. Talia, disillusioned with her father and his plans and using the name '''Talia Head''' for herself,&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Villains Secret Files and Origins'' (2005). "..Talia eventually distanced herself from both men and, taking the English translation of her surname, 'Head', as her American last name, became CEO of LexCorp."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Nick. [http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/2001-post-crisis-reviews/c-review-2001.php?topic=president-luthor-sfo1 Mild Mannered Reviews - Specials - President Luthor: Secret Files and Origins #1] "Luthor parks in front of an apartment and heads up alone. Ringing a doorbell, the accompanying door opens to reveal Talia. She lets him in and tells him not to call her Talia Al Ghul. Her name is Head, pronounced Heed."&lt;/ref&gt; leaves him to run [[LexCorp]] as its new CEO when [[Lex Luthor]] becomes [[President of the United States]]. Although she seemingly supports Luthor, she secretly works to undermine him, anonymously leaking news of his underhanded dealings to [[Superman]]. In ''Superman/Batman'' #6 (March 2004), when the time comes for Luthor's downfall, she sells all of LexCorp's assets to the [[Wayne Enterprises#Wayne Foundation|Wayne Foundation]], leaving Luthor penniless and his crimes exposed to all.

===''Death and the Maidens''===
In ''Batman: Death and the Maidens'' (2003) written by [[Greg Rucka]], it is revealed that Ra's al Ghul met a woman by whom he had a daughter named [[Nyssa Raatko|Nyssa]] during his travels in [[Russia]] in the 18th century. Ra's abandons Nyssa at a crucial time: she is tortured, her entire family is killed in a concentration camp during [[the Holocaust]], and she is rendered [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]] when [[Nazi]] doctors pour acid into her uterus. Seeking vengeance, Nyssa plans to use her considerable wealth and resources to kill Ra's by befriending, kidnapping, and brainwashing Talia, turning her into a weapon to kill their father. To this end, she captures Talia and kills and resurrects her in rapid succession in a Lazarus Pit, leaving Talia virtually broken from the trauma of dying again and again in so short a time as Nyssa asks Talia why her father is 'letting' this happen to her. Rendered apathetic by her time in the camp, unable to feel anything, Nyssa also plans to assassinate Superman with [[Kryptonite]] bullets she stole from the [[Batcave]], hoping that, by uniting the world in one moment of tragedy, she would manage to rouse herself once more.

While Batman is successful in preventing the assassination of Superman, he is unable to stop Nyssa from killing Ra's. This, in turn, is actually part of a greater plan concocted by Ra's, who wants to ensure that his daughters would accept their [[destiny|destinies]] as his heirs and take up his genocidal campaign. Realizing and accepting this, Nyssa and Talia become the heads of The Demon, with Talia disavowing her love for Bruce Wayne as another result of her torture at Nyssa's hands (both sisters then consider Batman to be their enemy). Talia from then on became more often Batman's enemy than an ally.&lt;ref name="Greenberger 2008 180"/&gt;

===The Society===
In ''[[Infinite Crisis|Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'', it is revealed that Talia is one of the core members of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] (the others were Lex Luthor (secretly [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] in disguise), [[Black Adam]], [[Doctor Psycho]], [[Deathstroke]], and [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]]). This is revealed to be part of one of half-sister [[Nyssa Raatko|Nyssa]]'s plans to take over the planet and bring about world peace and equality. After Nyssa is killed by Batgirl [[Cassandra Cain]], Talia assumes leadership of the League.&lt;ref name="supermanencyc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenberger 2008 180"/&gt;

===''Under the Hood'' and ''Red Hood: The Lost Days''===
[[File:Talia al Ghul.png|thumb|170px|Talia al Ghul in ''Red Hood and the Outlaws''#2 (2011). Art by Kenneth Rocafort.]]
During the "[[Batman: A Death in the Family|Death in the Family]]" (1988) storyline, [[Jason Todd]], the second Robin, is murdered by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in Ethiopia. He was later revived as a character, and in ''[[Batman: Under the Hood|Under the Hood]]'' (2005), he is discovered by the League of Assassins. In "Lost Days", out of her love for Batman, Talia takes Jason to her father and Jason spends months in the care of the League of Assassins. Although his body recuperates, Jason's mind is shattered.

Seeing no other way to help him, Talia takes Jason down to the [[Lazarus Pit]] and throws his body in while her father regenerates himself. Jason is fully revived in body and mind. Immediately afterward, in order to spare Jason her father's wrath, she aids the boy's escape.

Livid at the fact that Batman failed to avenge his (Jason's) death by killing the Joker and that Batman had done nothing more than imprison him again, Jason pursues his own brand of justice. In order to stall him from killing Batman, Talia agrees to finance Jason and aid him in his training, so that he can then become the second [[Red Hood]].&lt;ref&gt;''Red Hood: The Lost Days'' 1-6 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Annual'' (vol. 1) #25 (March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, this story was changed, whereby ''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #2 (2011) shows that, shortly after Jason Todd's return from the dead, Talia al Ghul, out of her love for Batman, takes him to a secret cult of warrior monks called the All Caste to train in becoming a skilled assassin.

===''Batman and Son''===
The concept of Talia and Batman having a child from ''Son of the Demon'' is reinterpreted into continuity in the story ''[[Batman and Son]]'' (2006), written by [[Grant Morrison]]. Their son is grown in an artificial womb and named [[Damian Wayne|Damian]]. He is raised and trained in the League of Assassins. Talia introduces him to Batman as part of a grand scheme involving ninja [[Man-Bat|Man-Bats]] and the kidnapping of the British Prime Minister's wife. Morrison said he relied on his shaky memories of ''Son of the Demon'' before writing so he "messed up a lot of the details" such as Talia drugging Batman before sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cotton|first1=Mike|last2=Collins|first2=Sean|year=2006 |title=Son of a Bat!|publisher=[[Wizard Magazine]]|issue=182|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison's mistake was later retconned by then Batman and Robin writer Peter J. Tomasi in the title ''Robin Rises Omega'' where Batman admits that he fell in love and followed his heart.

===''R.I.P.'' and ''Final Crisis''===
During the ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'' storyline, Talia and Damian become aware of the Black Glove's plot against Batman and begins devising a plan to help save him. They arrive at [[Wayne Manor]] just in time to save Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] from being killed by assorted booby traps created by the Black Glove. This is referenced in issue 39 of the old 52. She offers to join forces with Gordon to save Batman. She and Gordon arrive too late, however, and are informed by Robin that Batman went missing and may be dead following a battle with [[Simon Hurt|Doctor Hurt]].

Furious that her love may be dead, she sends out her ninja  Man-Bats to murder [[Vesper Fairchild|Jezebel Jet]], who plays a major role in trying to kill Batman. Soon after it is revealed Batman did not die, but survives only to be captured by [[Darkseid]] during the [[Final Crisis]] and then apparently murdered by the New God.

Following Batman's apparent death, Talia apparently decides to leave Damian in the hands of his adopted brother [[Dick Grayson]], who later takes on the role of Batman, and selects Damian to succeed Tim Drake as Robin.

In ''[[Final Crisis]]'', she is placed on the new Society's inner circle by [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]. Despite Talia's interaction with the new Society she still behaves lovingly and almost devoted to Batman.

It is revealed in ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'' #2 that Talia has trained [[Catwoman]] to resist even the most intense psychological coercion to reveal [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]]'s secret identity.

Following an operation in which Damian's spine is replaced, it is revealed that Talia inserts an implant into his spine that allows her or anyone she chooses, including [[Deathstroke]], to control Damian's body remotely. She intends to use this device to force Damian to kill Dick Grayson, whom she perceives as holding her son back from his potential.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman and Robin'' #11 (April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; After Grayson frees Damian, Talia reveals to her son that she has begun cloning him after realizing that the Boy Wonder has completely sided with his father's circle during their confrontation. She is too much of a perfectionist to love her son after he has defied her in such a manner, and is no longer welcome in the House of al Ghul.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman and Robin'' #12 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Batman Incorporated''===
{{Very long|section|date=March 2017}}
In ''[[Batman Incorporated]]'', written by Grant Morrison, Talia is revealed to be the mastermind behind the [[Leviathan (DC Comics)|Leviathan]], a shadowy organization formed to oppose Bruce's "[[Batman Incorporated]]" project.

Talia says Batman must choose between saving Gotham from suicide or saving their son Damian from a death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Incorporated'' Vol. 2, #6 (January 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Her clone of Damian, known as the Heretic, stabs Damian through the chest and delivers the killing stroke to her son, a move that leaves Batman devastated.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Incorporated'' Vol. 2, #8 (February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; After the Heretic's final loss against Batman, Talia kills him, destroys Wayne Tower, and challenges Batman to a duel to the death in the Batcave.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Incorporated'' Vol. 2, #12 (July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; There, Talia poisons Batman. He embraces and kisses her mid-battle, not knowing that her lips were covered with poison, and he apologizes for not being able to love her the way she wants and admits defeat. Talia asks Batman to beg for the antidote but he does not respond. Jason Todd arrives at the Batcave and offers Talia the Oroboro trigger, a device that would trigger the destruction of seven cities and that she claims would provide a new source of energy for the world. When she attempts to activate the device, Jason reveals that he has double-crossed her and that the weapons the device would trigger had already been disarmed. Talia is then shot and killed by Spyral agent [[Kathy Kane]], buried, and her body later disappears from the grave site along with that of Damian.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Incorporated'' Vol. 2, #13 (August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison's writing of the Batman, Talia, and Damian saga drew from his own personal experience as a child of divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Truitt|first=Brian|date=2013-04-01|title=Grant Morrison recalls life and death of Damian Wayne|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2013/03/31/grant-morrison-batman-death-of-robin-comic-book/2037669/|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of ''Batman Incorporated'' marked the end of his seven-year run on the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Truitt|first=Brian|date=2013-07-28|title=Sunday Geekersation: Grant Morrison switches superheroes|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2013/07/28/grant-morrison-sunday-conversation-batman-wonder-woman/2586739/|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Batman was preoccupied with a series of cases that would not end, Talia's body is taken from the grave by her father, Ra's, so that he wishes to resurrect his daughter and his grandson, Damian, whose body was taken also. Batman continues his pursuit for Ra's and to reclaim his son's body.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman and Aquaman'' vol. 2 #29 (March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Ra's attempted to resurrect Talia alongside Damian in what he thought was a Lazarus Pit in the island of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], but instead Ra's discovered that it was a portal to a Netherworld in the Pit's former location, of which both Wonder Woman and Batman were already aware. Ra's flees with the bodies afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman and Wonder Woman'' vol. 2 #30 (April 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Batman arrives too late, when Ra's has successfully had the bodies placed in a Lazarus Pit, leaving Batman in dread.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman and Frankenstein'' vol. 2 #31 (May 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The resurrections fail, leaving Ra's to realize his arrogance for allowing the Heretic to kill his grandson, and regret of allowing his daughter, Talia to clone Damian. After defeating Ra's in combat as Batman intends to reclaim his son's body, their battle is intervened by [[Darkseid]]'s elite member [[Glorious Godfrey]] and some Parademons.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman and Ra's al Ghul'' vol. 2 #32 (June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Batman is forced to team-up with Ra's to battle Godfrey (who was here to retrieve the Chaos Shard, a powerful crystal that once belonged to Darkseid which Ra's has hidden inside Damian's body) and the Parademons had taken the bodies of Talia and Damian. Ra's manages to get his daughter's body from the Parademons in the sky, but falls into the gorge of Nanda Parbat along with Talia's body, while Batman tries to retrieve his son's body from Godfrey.&lt;ref&gt;''Robin Rises: Omega'' one-shot (July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Following Damian's resurrection, Talia had emerged on Nanda Parbat with no memory of who she was. She kills a nearby Tibetan to eat their food.&lt;ref&gt;''Robin Rises: Alpha'' one-shot (December 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Talia was approached by a shadowy figure; she is able to recognize the robed figure and feared that faction known as the Lu'un Darga is upon release, she is then knocked unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;''Robin: Son of Batman'' #1 (June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The robed figure restores Talia's memory and attempts to influence her as a servant, but Talia resists his control and knocks the robed figure with stalagmites. She tries to escape in the Lu'un Darga's unknown lair of the inner core with the heart of the Lazarus Pit.&lt;ref&gt;''Robin: Son of Batman'' #3 (August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When Talia was reunited with her son in the Lu'un Darga's lair on al Ghul Island, Damian is aware of his quest about the Lu'un Darga, does not desire to see her and attacks. In their battle, Talia unsuccessfully convinces Damian. She explains that Ra's and his al Ghul family wage war against the ancient immortals of the Lu'un Darga claiming to be guardians of the Lazarus Pit. While Ra's sought to bring power and balance of life to Earth, the Lu'un Darga then tried to take back all life and cleanse Earth entirely because they would bring their own destruction to see Earth and the heart of the Lazarus Pit. Talia also tells him he is being used as a pawn of Ra's to steal the Lu'un Darga's power. The mysterious robed figure was revealed to be Den Darga, who thanked Damian's inadvertently for bringing the relic and attempts to bring about the end of life on Earth. While Den Darga destroys al Ghul Island by causing it to sink, he attempts to cleanse Talia and Damian's souls, but the clones of Damian insulate him and sacrifice their lives. Den Darga flees, leaving Talia and Damian to the abyss; they were rescued by Damian's friends. Afterwards, Talia is hopeful to move somewhere to a safe place and tells her conscious son to rest.&lt;ref&gt;''Robin: Son of Batman'' #5 (October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When Damian is awake, Talia convinced her son to calm down and explains that she had been finding redemption for herself for her retribution against him and inaction after Den Darga's attack. She informs him that if he chooses vigilantism, it will corrupt him of his misdeeds. Talia then tells her son, Damian that he too can either choose between staying or leaving, after approving of who he is, except that his mother has been correcting herself and is regretful of her choices. As he chooses to leave and says goodbye to his mother, Talia regroups with the League of Assassins to prepare for war against Den Darga and the Lu'un Darga.&lt;ref&gt;''Robin: Son of Batman'' #6 (November 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Talia, along with Batman, show up again later in the title to aid their son in saving all life on Earth from the threat of Den and the Lu'un Darga.&lt;ref&gt;''Robin: Son of Batman'' #11 (April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; They are portrayed as a bickering couple but also put things aside to help.&lt;ref&gt;''Robin: Son of Batman'' #12 (May 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Their mission is a success though Damian ends up giving his life to save humanity. He is later brought back to life by Suren Darga. With the world saved and satisfied her son is safe she goes ahead to rejoin the League of Assassins.&lt;ref&gt;''Robin: Son of Batman'' #13 (June 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

===DC Rebirth===

Subsequently in ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Talia al Ghul shows up for her son, Damian Wayne's birthday and warns him of Ra's al Ghul plot to send the Demon's Fist against Damian and the Teen Titans in a plan to assassinate them to prove their worth to the Demon's Head. These targets will later become Damian's Teen Titans teammates after he saves them, kidnaps them and makes them aware of the Fist and their plans.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' vol. 6 #1 (October 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

She later appears in ''Batman'' #33. Batman and Catwoman come to Khadym to see Holly Robinson, who has been hiding with Talia since fleeing Gotham after killing hundreds of terrorists. Talia initially refuses to allow them to see Holly, going as far as severely wounding Batman and challenging Catwoman to a duel. Selina manages to defeat Talia by wounding her in the same manner that she did Batman beforehand.

==Powers and abilities==
Talia has been written to be an athlete at the peak of physical conditioning and has been trained in many forms of martial arts.&lt;ref name="supermanencyc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenberger 2008 180"/&gt; She was educated in the arts and sciences, and she holds advanced degrees in biology, engineering, and business as an [[MBA]].&lt;ref name="supermanencyc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Greenberger| first = Robert| authorlink = Robert Greenberger| title = The Essential Batman Encyclopedia| publisher = [[Del Rey Books]] | year = 2008| page = 179}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also quite proficient with most hand weapons.

[[File:Talia al Ghul (Bruce Timm).jpg|thumb|upright|Talia in the DC Animated Universe. Art by Bruce Timm.]]
* Talia al Ghul appears in the [[DC Animated Universe]], voiced by [[Helen Slater]] and by [[Olivia Hussey]].
** Talia appears in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by Slater. Introduced in "Off Balance", she is sent to go after [[Count Vertigo|Vertigo]] (her father's ex-servant) in [[Gotham City]]. When she and [[Batman]] are attacked and taken prisoner by the League of Shadows, Talia tends to Bruce Wayne's wounds. She proposes a temporary partnership with Batman, and they together defeat Vertigo. However, she double-crosses Batman in order to steal Vertigo's sonic weapon for Ra's al Ghul. Talia returns in the two-parter "The Demon's Quest". When she and [[Dick Grayson]] are abducted, Batman and Ra's work together to rescue them. It is ultimately revealed that Ra's staged their kidnappings to test Batman's suitability as an heir and son-in-law. Talia later helps Batman defeat her father. In "Avatar", Talia helps Bruce go after Ra's to stop from a self-destructive bid for immortality. Ra's disowns Talia and attempts to kill her and Batman. Nevertheless, the couple saves Ra's when this quest for immortality threatens her father's life. When she sees that Batman intends to take Ra's to the authorities, Talia turns on the Dark Knight so that her father can escape.
** Talia also appears in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by Hussey. In "The Demon's Reborn", Talia tries to save Ra's al Ghul with a Native American artifact in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. Although both [[Superman]] and Batman try to stop her, Talia subdues Superman with the artifact. Combining the artifact with technology, she transfers Superman's powers to revive her dying father. Though father and daughter's latest quest is successful, an ensuing scuffle with the Man of Steel and the Dark Knight results in the two being tossed into an underground river.
** ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' reveals that, after assisting Bruce in thwarting her father's plan to destroy the world in 'the near-apocalypse of '09', Talia's consciousness has been replaced by Ra's al Ghul's. Her own father impersonates Talia to manipulate the elderly Bruce Wayne into using the [[Lazarus Pit]] as part of a plot to copy his mind patterns to Bruce's invigorated body, but he is defeated by Batman ([[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]]), and is last shown in his base as it explodes when an electric cable strikes the Pit.
* Talia al Ghul appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Andrea Bowen]]. In "Sidekicks Assemble!", it's implied that she has a crush on Robin. Talia appears again in "Crisis: 22,300 Miles Above Earth!" but has no dialogue and is revealed to be in love with Batman when she kisses the Dark Knight and helps defeat Ra's al Ghul.

Nyssa fights Talia and is apparently defeated by her paternal half-sister. When Simon commits suicide which triggers C4 bombs across the whole island, Talia's fate is unknown. However, season seven revealed that Talia survived the explosion thanks to a drug provided by [[Richard Dragon|Ricardo Diaz]]. After "running afoul of an old foe in Gotham", she was incarcerated at Slabside Maximum Security Prison where she was placed in Level 2. Under the "Demon" alias, Talia helped Diaz to order different attacks on Oliver. After Oliver helped in her escape, Talia dropped off the USB involving Jarrett Parker's illegal psychiatric activities on them to Felicty Smoak which led to Level 2 getting shut down and Jarrett getting fired. Though Talia later returned and slew Jarrett as payback for what she has been through.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1670">'''The Wallies of Wessex''' were a group of people who squatted on ground close to [[Stonehenge]] in 1974.  The Department of the Environment and the National Trust landowners started court proceedings to have the squatters evicted. The squatters both to make a [[counterculture|counter culture]] point (and to protect themselves from court costs) used aliases in court all of which started with a first name of [[Wally (anonymous)|Wally]]. They lost the case and had to move a few feet to an alternative site, but the case was reported in the national press.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd edition. ''wally, ''n.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' citing "1974 Times 8 Aug. 2/4"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ayers&gt;{{Citation |first=Nigel |last=Ayers |date=30 November 2010&lt;!--last edited--&gt; |url=http://www.earthlydelights.co.uk/netnews/wally.html |title=Where's Wally |accessdate=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wallies were involved in the organisation of the 1976 [[Trentishoe|Trentishoe Whole Earth Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/trentishoe76.html Exmoor welcomes the pop festival 'Wallies' - Trentishoe Free Festival 1976]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[Nigel Ayers]] states that largely through later publications by [[Penny Rimbaud]] of the punk band [[Crass]], the name `Wally' became increasingly identified  with one man, [[Wally Hope]] aka Phil Russell who had written and published much of the promotional material for the 1974  Stonehenge festival.&lt;ref name=Ayers/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3172">'''Friedrich Theodor von Schubert''' (30 October 1758 &amp;ndash; 21 October 1825) was a German astronomer and geographer. Born in [[Helmstedt]], his father, [[Johann Ernst Schubert]], was a professor of theology and abbot of [[Michaelstein Abbey]]. Theodor likewise studied theology, but didn't like it. He traveled abroad, first to Sweden in 1779. He then went to [[Bartelshagen]], where he became the tutor of the children of Major von Cronhelm. Since the major was fond of mathematics and astronomy, Theodor had to study these himself to be able to teach those subjects. He then married the daughter of the major, Luise Friederike von Cronhelm. Afterwards, he traveled to [[Tallinn]] in [[Estonia]], again as a house teacher. He moved on to [[Haapsalu]], teaching mathematics to young noblemen as a preparation for a life as an officer. In 1785 he became an assistant of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] as a geographer, and by June 1789 he was a full member. In 1803, he became head of the astronomical observatory of the Academy. In 1805, he was a member of the failed Russian expedition to China, together with his son. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1812.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter S|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterS.pdf|publisher=[[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He not only produced some scientific works, but also popularized astronomy. Between 1788 and 1825, he published the  ''St. Petersburger Kalender'', and between 1808 and 1818 the ''St. Petersburger astronomischen Taschenkalender''. He also wrote for the newspapers and for the German language ''St. Petersburger Zeitung'', which he edited from 1810 until his death.

His son [[Friedrich von Schubert]] was a general in the Russian army and explorer.

The lunar crater [[Schubert (lunar crater)|Schubert]] is named after him.

'''Timothy Allan Burgess''' (born 30 May 1967) is an English singer-songwriter and record label owner, best known as the lead singer of the [[alternative rock]] band [[The Charlatans (English band)|The Charlatans]].

==Early life==
{{expand section|date=April 2014}}
Burgess was born in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales-births-1837-2006?firstname=timothy%20allan&amp;lastname=burgess|title=findmypast.co.uk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and grew up in Moulton, near  [[Northwich]], Cheshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northwichguardian.co.uk/news/951273.north_country_boy_tims_back_in_town/|title=North country boy Tim’s back in town|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===The Charlatans===
[[File:The Charlatans - Amanda Ratcliffe.jpg|alt=The Charlatans|left|thumb|The Charlatans live at The Powerstation, Auckland, New Zealand, 2018]]
Burgess was initially the lead singer in The Electric Crayons (named after the [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] compilation album ''The Electric Crayon Set'',{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} released on the Bam-Caruso record label&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Various – The Electric Crayon Set|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-The-Electric-Crayon-Set/release/599216|work=Various – The Electric Crayon Set on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=3 April 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), who released one single, "Hip Shake Junkie".{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Burgess then joined [[The Charlatans (English band)|The Charlatans]], who were largely influenced by [[acid house]], 1960s-era [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] psychedelia and the [[Syd Barrett]] era of [[Pink Floyd]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The Charlatans' debut single "Indian Rope" was successful, and the group subsequently signed to [[Situation Two]], an offshoot of the [[Beggars Banquet Records|Beggars Banquet]] label. In 1990 they released the single "[[The Only One I Know]]" on the imprint, which charted in the [[Top 40|Top 10]] of the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

| page= 100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band have released twelve studio albums to date.

Prior to the release of the 2004 Charlatans album ''[[Up at the Lake]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charlatans, The – Up at the Lake|url=http://www.discogs.com/Charlatans-Up-At-The-Lake/release/367072|work=The Charlatans on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=3 April 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burgess was living in [[Los Angeles]] in the USA, away from the other band members who were still based in England. He explained the band's process during that period in a 2012 interview: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I'm back in London now, but Mark and Tony enjoyed trips out to Los Angeles and we used Los Angeles as a writing tool. I loved the idea of incorporating a city into your music. We used LA quite a lot."&lt;ref name="Spy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tim Burgess interview: 'I must have enjoyed my time on drugs'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/interviews/a378813/tim-burgess-interview-i-must-have-enjoyed-my-time-on-drugs.html#~oAlSslNi4Z3geH|work=Digital Spy.|publisher=Hearst Magazines UK|accessdate=3 April 2014|author=Mayer Nissim|date=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Solo===
[[File:Tim Burgess - Amanda Ratcliffe.jpg|alt=Tim Burgess|left|thumb|Tim Burgess live at The Powerstation, Auckland, New Zealand, 2018]]
Burgess's debut solo album, ''I Believe'', was released in Europe on 3 September 2003 and included the track "Oh My Corazon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tim Burgess – I Believe|url=http://www.discogs.com/Tim-Burgess-I-Believe/release/628822|work=Tim Burgess on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=3 April 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgess' second solo album ''[[Oh No I Love You]]'' was produced by Mark Nevers and recorded at his home in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], US.&lt;ref name="List" /&gt; In 2012, Burgess explained the origin of this album :
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The root of this album goes right back to a [[Kurt Wagner (musician)|Kurt Wagner]] show in Manchester. I carried Kurt's guitar to the car for him. I took the chance to ask him if he would ever consider writing a song with me. He said, "Sure Tim, you write the music and I'll write the words." That one song turned into an album and almost ten years after we first talked about it, the album is ready."&lt;ref name="List"&gt;{{cite web|title=LISTEN: Factory Floor Remix Tim Burgess|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/10075-listen-tim-burgess-white-factory-floor-gabe-gurnsey-remix-oh-no-i-love-you|work=The Quietus|publisher=The Quietus|accessdate=3 April 2014|author=Laurie Tuffrey|date=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Oh No I Love You'' also features collaborations with [[Factory Floor]], [[R. Stevie Moore]] and [[My Morning Jacket]], amongst others. The album was later nominated for the [[Artrocker]] 'Album of the Year' award in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ARTROCKER AWARDS 2012 –  Nominations Revealed + VOTE NOW !|url=http://www.artrocker.tv/news/article/artrocker-awards-2012-nominations-revealed-vote-now|work=Artrocker|publisher=Artrocker Magazine|accessdate=3 April 2014|date=8 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407115849/http://www.artrocker.tv/news/article/artrocker-awards-2012-nominations-revealed-vote-now|archivedate=7 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborations===
Burgess contributed vocals to [[Saint Etienne (band)|Saint Etienne]]'s 1993 song "I Was Born on Christmas Day", which appeared on the "Xmas 93" CD single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St Etienne* – Xmas 93|url=http://www.discogs.com/St-Etienne-Xmas-93/release/5765|work=St Etienne on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=3 April 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgess has twice contributed vocals to tracks by [[The Chemical Brothers]]: 1995's "Life Is Sweet", taken from their debut album ''[[Exit Planet Dust]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemical Brothers, The – Life Is Sweet|url=http://www.discogs.com/Chemical-Brothers-Life-Is-Sweet/release/57194|work=The Chemical Brothers on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=3 April 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2005's "The Boxer", from their ''[[Push the Button (The Chemical Brothers album)|Push the Button]]'' album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemical Brothers, The – The Boxer|url=http://www.discogs.com/Chemical-Brothers-The-Boxer/release/484809|work=The Chemical Brothers on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=3 April 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgess is a member of [[The Chavs]], together with [[Carl Barât]] ([[The Libertines]]) and [[Jamie Reynolds]] ([[The Klaxons]]). In mid-2008, Burgess stated that the band planned to record their debut album in August of that year;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Klaxons, Charlatans and DPT supergroup to record album|url=http://www.nme.com/news/dirty-pretty-things/37486|work=NME|publisher=IPC Media Entertainment Network|accessdate=3 April 2014|date=19 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, as of July 2015, an album has yet to emerge. Burgess explained in a 2010 interview: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I think The Chavs have definitely got this mythical thing going on. They have existed and will exist again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burgess works with Klaxons, Horrors stars|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a228124/burgess-works-with-klaxons-horrors-stars.html#~oAlHxAlOCpwzoI|work=Digital Spy.|publisher=Hearst Magazines UK|accessdate=3 April 2014|author=Mayer Nissim|date=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Burgess remixed the [[Robots in Disguise]] song "The Tears", which was released in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Products|url=http://www.president-records.co.uk/catalogue/Product1702?THE-TEARS-(HERETIC-MIX---TIM-BURGESS)|work=President Records|publisher=President Records|accessdate=3 April 2014|year=2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407085205/http://www.president-records.co.uk/catalogue/Product1702?THE-TEARS-(HERETIC-MIX---TIM-BURGESS)|archivedate=7 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Burgess curated the Big Top stage at the [[Isle of Wight Festival]], with a line-up that included [[Killing Joke]] and [[The Horrors]]. Burgess later explained his reason for selecting The Horrors:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I really believed in them from the very first time I met them. It was at the time when their first album was released."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charlatans' Tim Burgess reveals Isle of Wight festival secrets|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-charlatans/44949|work=NME|publisher=IPC Media Entertainment Network|accessdate=3 April 2014|date=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burgess contributed vocals to the song "You Don't Know This About Me" by [[Freebass]], the group featuring [[New Order (band)|New Order]] ex-member [[Peter Hook]] and Gary "[[Mani (musician)]]" Mounfield of [[The Stone Roses]]. The song was released in 2010 as part of the band's debut EP ''Two Worlds Collide''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audio: Freebass’ ‘You Don’t Know This About Me’ (Arthur Baker Mix), with Tim Burgess|url=http://www.slicingupeyeballs.com/2010/08/21/freebass-you-dont-know-this-about-me-arthur-baker-remixes-ep/|work=Slicing Up Eyeballs|publisher=Slicing Up Eyeballs|accessdate=3 April 2014|date=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in Los Angeles, Burgess collaborated with [[Joaquin Phoenix]] on an album that Phoenix was recording at the time; however, in a 2012 interview, Burgess explained that he had not heard from Phoenix since his return to the UK:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I've not seen him for ages... I don't live in Los Angeles anymore. The time that we spent together was a really great moment. A really great couple of months for me really. He invited me into the recording studio to work on a record and we had a really great time. All relationships with people in bands or actors I've met along the way, you meet them, you're best friends for a minute and you just don't see them at all. If you just remember them as being really great friends and in a way they are. Even if you don't see someone, it's kind of better, 'cos you never get a chance to fall out!"&lt;ref name="Spy" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 15 November 2012, Burgess performed at [[Manchester Cathedral]] as part of a "supergroup" featuring [[Mark Collins (musician)|Mark Collins]] of [[The Charlatans (English band)|The Charlatans]], [[Martin Duffy (musician)|Martin Duffy]] of [[Primal Scream]], and [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s Peter Hook. The performance was part of a concert organised to help the city's "deprived youth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gig Review: Music For Cities @ Manchester Cathedral – November 15|url=http://www.mancunianmatters.co.uk/content/191164970-gig-review-music-cities-manchester-cathedral-%E2%80%93-november-15|work=Mancunian Matters|publisher=Mancunian Matters|accessdate=3 April 2014|author=Kevin Benson|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgess collaborated with [[Asia Argento]] on the song "Hours / Ours", which was released on Burgess's own record label O Genesis in 2014.&lt;ref name="Fact" /&gt;

Burgess collaborated with Peter Gordon to release Same Language Different Worlds on 2 September 2017 through Burgess' own label, O Genesis. The Charlatans frontman originally met New Yorker Peter Gordon in 2012 and they decided then on a music collaboration. Burgess had been a long time fan of Gordon’s work with Arthur Russell and The Love Of Life Orchestra. The album was produced by Gordon in New York and features many of his and Tim’s previous collaborators: Ernie Brooks who played with Arthur Russell on the first Modern Lovers album, trombone player Peter Zummo, conga player Mustafa Ahmed and Nik Void from Factory Floor.

===O Genesis===
O Genesis is Burgess's own record label, founded in 2011. A compilation CD showcasing the label's artists was released on 10 March 2014, featuring Burgess as a solo artist alongside artists such as [[Minny Pops]], [[Hatcham Social]] and Joseph Coward.&lt;ref name="Fact"&gt;{{cite web|title=TIM BURGESS READIES O GENESIS LABEL COMPILATION FEATURING R.

===Other work===
In February 2013, Burgess replaced [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] host [[Lauren Laverne]] when she and other [[NUJ|National Union of Journalists (NUJ)]] members engaged in strike action against the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC strike: presenters join walkout|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/18/bbc-strike-presenters-walkout|accessdate=3 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 February 2013|author=Josh Halliday|author2=Tara Conlan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Burgess' autobiography ''Telling Stories'' was published in 2012 by [[Viking Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Telling Stories, By Tim Burgess|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/telling-stories-by-tim-burgess-7697695.html|accessdate=3 April 2014|newspaper=The Independent|date=1 May 2012|author=Fiona Sturges}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the release of the book, Burgess responded to a question about whether he would have changed anything about his career:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No, because I would have had to re-write it again! Everything that happened happened because we made a decision at a point in time and at certain ages. I had a relationship with drugs for quite a long time. I'm glad it's over but at the same time I don't regret it. I must have enjoyed it because I did it for so long. It's the same with the relationship with other people. They lasted as long as they did because they were mostly quite good.&lt;ref name="Spy" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 2012, Burgess told ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' why he practises [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;At the minimum it de-stresses you. You get thoughts — it's not psychedelic—but things pop into your brain. [[John Lennon]] used to stop and write his ideas down; I choose not to. I'm enjoying myself so much I don't want to stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.t-m.org.uk/meditation-news/2012/05/britpop-star-tim-burgess-on-success-excess-and-consciousness|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105011311/http://www.t-m.org.uk/meditation-news/2012/05/britpop-star-tim-burgess-on-success-excess-and-consciousness/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 November 2012|title=The lead singer of the British band Charlatans talks to ''Metro'', ''The Daily Telegraph" and "The Independent about making it, detox and Transcendental Meditation|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date= 9 May 2012|accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burgess lived in Los Angeles for twelve years, return to the UK in 2013.{{r|pen}}

In March 2014, during a BBC Radio 6 interview with [[Roddy Frame]], it was revealed that Burgess is a fan of the music of both Frame and [[Edwyn Collins]], and invited the pair to play at a Manchester café that he owns. Frame stated during the interview that Burgess is "so positive" and both will occasionally drink tea together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radcliffe and Maconie: Roddy Frame chats to Stuart Maconie|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01wk20s|work=BBC Radio 6 Music|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 April 2014|date=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2011-06-05 TTF 14.jpg|thumb|From the outside]]
The '''Tong Tong Fair''' (formerly known as '''''Pasar Malam Besar''''') is the largest festival in the world for [[Indo people|Indo]] (European-Indonesian) culture, held annually in the [[Netherlands]]. In 2009 it was renamed to 'Tong Tong Fair'. Established in 1959 it is one of the oldest festivals and the fourth largest grand [[fair]] in the Netherlands. It is also the annual event with the highest number of paying visitors of the Dutch city of [[The Hague]], having consistently attracted more than 100,000 visitors since 1993.

The name ‘[[Pasar Malam]] Besar’ is derived from the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]/[[Malay language]] and literally means ‘Great Night Market’. The new name was chosen to emphasise its link with the 'Tong Tong Foundation' and its cultural mission. Another reason was to distinguish oneself from the many other fairs under the name ''pasar malam''.

Every summer the fair is raised on its dedicated fairground, called the ‘Malieveld’, close to the central train station of The Hague. 22.000 m² of festival terrain and many, mostly Indo, volunteers will facilitate visitors from both the Netherlands and abroad. The festival hosts three popular food courts, a culinary theatre, many large to medium stages for performance art, workshop areas, areas for lecture and interviews, market areas, as well as specific fair areas for trading merchandise.

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TJALIE.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Founding father [[Tjalie Robinson]].]] --&gt;
In defiance of government pressure to assimilate into Dutch society, a group of outspoken and independent Indos, organized in the so-called ‘Indies Cultural Circle’, assembled around famous Indo intellectual [[Tjalie Robinson]]. One of their accomplishments was the founding of the ‘Pasar Malam Besar’ in 1959. Its continued success in attracting visitors of all generations and presenting a diverse and progressive programme, while preserving the centuries-old cultural ties with the Indonesian Archipelago has gone beyond their expectations. In 2003 HM Queen [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]] herself officially opened the 45th ‘Pasar Malam Besar’. The royal opening was repeated in 2008 for its 50th edition, which was the last time the name Pasar Malam Besar was used.

Since the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] and the expulsion of all Dutch citizens from the Republic of Indonesia, the consequent fall out between the Netherlands and Indonesia has led to a long freeze of political, economical and even academic and cultural relations between the 2 nations. To a degree, this has lasted well into the 21st century. The Tong Tong Fair has always attempted to rekindle and foster those relations and since the 1970s consistently invited Indonesian artisans to the event. It was here that for instance the Royal princesses of [[Surakarta|Solo]], daughters of [[Pakubuwono XII]], performed the exclusive Serimpi dances in 1985. It was the first time in history that members of the Surakarta nobility performed these dances outside the [[Kraton (Indonesia)|Kraton]] (Royal Palace) of Solo.

In 1985 the Tong Tong Fair also organised a benefit to help rebuild the Kraton of Solo, that was damaged by a fire. In 2006 the Tong Tong Fair organised a benefit to help Indonesian victims of the 2004 [[Tsunami]].

==Programme==

===Music and dance===
[[File:PasarMalamBesar2006.jpg|thumb|right250px|Third generation Indo artists from the Netherlands perform at, then, the Pasar Malam Besar, 2006.]]
Two specific forms of Indo music usually take center stage. [[Kroncong]] ({{lang-nl|Krontjong}}, {{lang-id|Keroncong}}) which is an age old music form, with roots in Portuguese Fado music, that developed in Indo communities around Batavia (Now [[Jakarta]]). Classic Kroncong orchestras can still be found in both the Netherlands and Indonesia. The other typical music form is called [[Indorock]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FALutagdHNw Live video footage - Indorock performance]&lt;/ref&gt; It combines flamboyant showmanship and musical virtuoso, based on the American Rock and Roll idiom and has been played by Indo bands ever since the early fifties. With the participation of 3rd and 4th generation Indos, also DJ’s, Hiphoppers and urban live bands are taking their brand of Indo music to the stage at the 'Tong Tong Fair' / ‘Pasar Malam Besar’.

===Food and beverage===
[[File:2011-06-05 TTF 32.jpg|thumb|Indonesian food in the ''Eetwijk'']]
The multi faceted Indo cuisine ({{lang-nl|Indische keuken}}, {{lang-id|masakan Indo}}) is considered one of the first fusion kitchens in the world and is heavily based on the kitchens of many different Indonesian areas. The classic ‘[[Rijsttafel]]’ (a Dutch word meaning `Rice-table’) is a prime example of a Eurasian culinary concept that wasn’t prevalent in pre-colonial Indonesia. The food courts present a wide range of traditional Indonesian and Asian dishes. The culinary theatre allows visitors to share and discuss recipes and make and taste dishes. The market stalls sell fresh Asian fruit such as [[durian]] or [[manggis]] and snacks such as [[martabak]] or [[pisang goreng]]. The abundance of food on offer attracts many visitors.

===Merchandise and culture===
[[File:2011-06-05 TTF 35.jpg|thumb|Stand with Indonesian kitsch and culture]]
A large section of the ‘Tong Tong Fair’ is reserved for amongst others Indonesian businesses selling their merchandise which includes antiques, [[Yogyakarta|Yogya]] or [[Bali]] silver, furniture, batiks, wood carvings and much more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsAg9Otzy0Q Video report in Indonesian language.]&lt;/ref&gt; But next to the above-mentioned eye catchers the ‘Tong Tong Fair’ also offers workshops and master classes in the arts and lecture on amongst others literature, architecture and cultural research. Notable also are the comprehensive cultural delegations from specific areas in [[Indonesia]] that are invited to participate.

==Awards==
[[File:TongTongfaireinsvier (14).jpg|thumb|Dance group in 2014]]
The Tong Tong Fair, at that time still known as the Pasar Malam Besar, won the Promotion Award of The Hague in December 2006 in the category Tourism and Economy. This was followed in June 2007 by the prestigious Grand Prix of the National Events Awards (the ‘Oscars’ of the Dutch events industry). The Grand Prix is only awarded to events, which in terms of size, standing and allure, have become a real phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Previous winners of the Grand Prix include the International Film Festival Rotterdam and North Sea Jazz Festival.[http://www.tongtongfestival.nl/?page_id=545]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the Tong Tong Foundation received the highest award of the city of the Hague (The Stadspenning by the municipality of The Hague).

==Challenges==
[[File:2011-06-05 TTF 49.jpg|thumb|Dance group Kurung Kurung from [[Leiden]]]]
Notwithstanding the great number of visitors the festival attracts to this day, the greatest challenge facing it is formulating a clear vision for the future and strong strategy towards achieving its cultural mission. As the most important exhibition of [[Indo people|Indo]] culture it will need to transform beyond an event of nostalgia for the [[Dutch East Indies]] towards a dynamic catalyst facilitating the evolution of Indo identity and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Iburg, Nora ''“Van Pasar Malam tot I Love Indo, identiteitsconstructie en manifestatie door drie generaties Indische Nederlanders.”'' (Master thesis, Arnhem University, 2009, Ellessy Publishers, 2010) p.91-95  {{ISBN|978-90-8660-104-2}} [http://www.vanstockum.nl/product/12299438/Van-Pasar-Malam-tot-'I-love-Indo'.html].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Matthew, Isaac ''"The Komedie Stamboel: popular theater in colonial Indonesia, 1891-1903."'' (Publisher: Ohio University Press, 2006) P.368 See: [https://books.google.com/books?id=-fbw-06ovVIC&amp;dq=komedie+stamboel&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]&lt;/ref&gt; Other modern challenges concern its potential online and multi-lingual role in social media as well as their ability to professionally register the many unique cultural activities and performances hosted.

'''William John Mitchell''' (15 December 1944 &amp;ndash; 11 June 2010) was an [[Australia]]n-born author, educator, [[architect]] and [[urban design]]er, best known for leading the integration of architectural and related design arts practice with computing and other technologies.

==Biography==
Mitchell was born on 15 December 1944, in [[Horsham, Victoria]], [[Australia]]. He earned an undergraduate degree in 1967 from the [[University of Melbourne]] with a major in architecture and was awarded master's degrees from both [[Yale University]] (a Master of Environmental Design in [[environmental design]] in 1969) and the [[University of Cambridge]] (in 1977 with a major in architecture).&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Grimes, William. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/16/us/16mitchell.html "William J. Mitchell, Architect and Urban Visionary, Dies at 65"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 15 June 2010. Accessed 16 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MITCV&gt;[http://web.media.mit.edu/~wjm/wjm_cv_3_02.html CV of William J. Mitchell], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Accessed 16 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell headed the architecture and urban design program at the Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Planning at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] starting in 1970. He was named the G. Ware and Edythe M. Travelstead Professor of Architecture and director of the Master of Design Studies program at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] in 1986 and was named as Professor of Architecture and Media Arts and Sciences and Dean of the [[MIT School of Architecture and Planning]] in 1992. His 1977 book ''Computer-Aided Architectural Design'' and his 1990 work ''The Logic of Architecture: Design, Computation and Cognition'' were credited by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as having "profoundly changed the way architects approached building design".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;ref name=MITCV/&gt;

[[Image:Mitcargreenback2.jpg|thumb|right|A conceptual design of the [[MIT Car]].]]
At MIT, Mitchell served as an advisor to MIT President [[Charles Marstiller Vest]] in guiding a decade-long, five-building expansion project at the university that included designs by [[Charles Correa]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Steven Holl]], [[Fumihiko Maki]] and [[Kevin Roche]], and added one million square feet of classroom, office and other spaces to the MIT campus.&lt;ref name=MITObit&gt;Frost, Greg. [http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/obit-mitchell "Bill Mitchell, former dean of MIT's School of Architecture and Planning, dies at age 65"], ''MITnews'', 12 June 2010. Accessed 16 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The building project became the subject of his 2007 book ''Imagining MIT: Designing a Campus for the 21st Century'', which was written in a single weekend while he was at a [[Dublin]] hotel.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;ref name=MITObit/&gt; At the dedication ceremonies for the Frank Gehry-designed [[Stata Center]] in 2004, Mitchell said that schools like MIT "carry a particular responsibility to conceive of architectural projects not just as the rational allocation of resources to achieve quantifiable management goals, but also as inventive, critical contributions to our evolving culture" and that anything less would be "a betrayal of their advertised principles".

Starting in 2003, he created the Smart Cities program within the [[MIT Media Lab]]. Projects that Mitchell developed as part of the Smart Cities program included [[GreenWheel]], a device that would add electric power to a bicycle; [[RoboScooter]], a foldable electric scooter; and the [[MIT Car]] (also called the "[[CityCar]]", and developed into the [[Hiriko]]), which would be propelled by electric motors built into its wheels.  The car and scooter projects were envisioned as being made available for public use at locations in cities, with access and scheduling controlled by computer.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; The MIT Car was designed to fold up into a more compact shape while parked.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://www.justmeans.com/William-J-Mitchell-Sustainable-Design-Pioneer-dies-at-65/18457.html "William J. Mitchell, Sustainable Design Pioneer, dies at 65."], Justmeans.com, 15 June 2010. Accessed 16 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Mitchell's death, the CityCar Project was continued under the direction of Kent Larson in the Changing Places research group at the MIT Media Lab.

Mitchell was a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and was awarded seven honorary degrees.&lt;ref name=MITObit/&gt;  He was a prolific author, writing almost a dozen notable books, plus assorted papers, articles, and speeches.

A resident of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], Mitchell died due to complications of cancer at age 65 on 11 June 2010. He was survived by his second wife, Jane Wolfson and their son, as well as by a daughter from his first marriage, to Elizabeth Asmis.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

'''Zips''' (also '''''Siggies''''' or '''''Geeps''''') is a slang term often used as a derogatory slur by [[Italian American]] and [[Sicilian American]] mobsters in reference to newer immigrant Sicilian and Italian mafiosi. The name is said to have originated from mobsters' inability to understand the faster-speaking Sicilian dialects, which appeared to "zip" by. Other theories include pejorative uses such as Sicilians' preference for silent, homemade [[Improvised firearm|zip guns]].  According to still another theory, the term is a contraction of the Sicilian slang term for "hicks" or "primitives." The older Sicilian mafiosi of pre-[[Prohibition]] known as "[[Mustache Pete]]s" (who eventually were deposed by American-born mobsters during the [[Castellammarese War]]) were also referred to as zi

==Arrival in the United States==
With increasing violence and government presence in Italy, [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilians]] and [[Naples|Neapolitans]] alike found positions in the growing drug trafficking market of [[New York City]]'s [[Five Families]]. The [[Pizza Connection Trial|Pizza Connection]], a heroin drug trafficking operation involving [[Bonanno crime family]] capo Salvatore Catalano and Sicilian mafioso [[Gaetano Badalamenti]], was largely organized by Zips. The Zips were effective because they were unknown in the country and had no [[police record]]s. They hung out mainly by themselves in the [[Knickerbocker Avenue]] area. 

However, the younger Sicilian mafiosi became known for their reckless and undisciplined behavior which caused unwanted attention to New York's crime families. The Zips had no qualms about murdering people considered off-limits by the American Mafia, such as police officers, judges, women and children.  They were also known for blowing up their targets with bombs; although bombings are common in the Sicilian Mafia, American mafiosi have usually shied away from bombs out of concern that they could put innocent people at risk.  Zips have also been known to kill victims even when they are terminally ill; in the Sicilian Mafia, when someone is marked for death, that person cannot be allowed to die of natural causes.

Despite their penchant for recklessness, the group was tolerated as they were able to earn millions for the families, specifically the [[Bonanno crime family|Bonanno]] and [[Gambino crime family|Gambino families]], as both [[Carmine Galante]] and [[Carlo Gambino]] used zips for narcotics and murder. Galante's two personal bodyguards [[Cesare Bonventre]] and Baldo Amato, were Zips.

Many Italian-American mobsters distrusted the Zips, as Bonanno soldier [[Benjamin Ruggiero|Benjamin "Lefty" Ruggiero]] explained in a conversation to undercover FBI agent [[Joseph "Donnie Brasco" Pistone]]: ''"Lots of people hate him [Galante]... There's only a few people he's close to. And that's mainly the Zips... Those guys are always with him. He brought them over from Sicily, and he uses them for different pieces of work and for dealing all that junk [drugs]. They're as mean as he is. You can't trust those bastard Zips. Nobody can. Except the Old Man."'' On another occasion, Ruggiero told Pistone, ''"They hate the American people. They hate the American wiseguys."'' Bonanno soldier [[Anthony Mirra]] said to Pistone, ''"The Zips are [[clannish]] and [[secretive]]''. They are the meanest killers in the business"''.

==The Pizza Connection==
With Galante's cooperation, as well as support from Sicilian mafiosi, the Zips' influence and power in New York's underworld grew. Eventually they were able to arrange a working relationship between American and Sicilian mafiosi to begin large-scale drug trafficking operations to distribute [[heroin]] into the United States; Sicilian mafiosi would purchase the [[morphine]] base in the [[Middle East]], where it would be processed into heroin, before being shipped to New York for distribution. 

Supplying support services and specific areas for distribution, New York's crime families collected a percentage of income from drug dealers while keeping themselves distanced from federal prosecution. By the late 1970s, Galante had been bringing in large numbers of Zips for the rapidly growing heroin distribution market (which had been peaking at $10 million a year). Ironically, Galante's Zip bodyguards were party to his murder. Galante was murdered for keeping all the heroin trafficking profits for himself.
