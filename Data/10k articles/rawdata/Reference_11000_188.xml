The '''Bargello''', also known as the '''Palazzo del Bargello''', '''Museo Nazionale del Bargello''', or '''Palazzo del Popolo''' (Palace of the People), is a former barracks and prison, now an art museum, in [[Florence]], [[Italy]].

==Terminology==
The word ''bargello'' appears to come from the late [[Latin]] ''bargillus'' (from [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''bargi'' and German ''burg''), meaning "castle" or "fortified tower". During the Italian [[Middle Ages]] it was the name given to a military captain in charge of keeping peace and justice (hence "Captain of justice") during riots and uproars. In Florence he was usually hired from a foreign city to prevent any appearance of favoritism on the part of the Captain. The position could be compared with that of a current Chief of police. The name Bargello was extended to the building which was the office of the captain.

==The palace==

[[Image:Bargello Courtyard 2007.jpg|thumb|left|155px|Inner courtyard.]]
Construction began in 1255. The palace was built to house first the [[Capitano del Popolo]] and later, in 1261, the '[[podestà]]', the highest magistrate of the Florence [[City Council]]. This Palazzo del Podestà, as it was originally called, is the oldest public building in Florence. This austere crenellated building served as model for the construction of the [[Palazzo Vecchio]]. In 1574, the [[Medici]] dispensed with the function of the ''Podestà'' and housed the ''bargello'', the police chief of Florence, in this building, hence its name.&lt;ref name=arch&gt;{{cite book | first=Guido | last=Zucconi | year=1995 | title=Florence: An Architectural Guide | edition=November 2001 Reprint | publisher=Arsenale Editrice | location=San Giovanni Lupatoto, Verona, Italy|isbn=88-7743-147-4| page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was employed as a prison; executions took place in the Bargello's yard until they were abolished by Grand Duke [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Peter Leopold]] in 1786, but it remained the headquarters of the Florentine police until 1859. When Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor Peter Leopold was exiled, the makeshift Governor of Tuscany decided that the Bargello should no longer be a jail, and it then became a national museum.

The original two-storey structure was built alongside the Volognana Tower in 1256. The third storey, which can be identified by the smaller blocks used to construct it, was added after the fire of 1323.  The building is designed around an open courtyard with an external staircase leading to the second floor. An open well is found in the centre of the courtyard.&lt;ref name=arch/&gt;

The Bargello opened as a national museum (''Museo Nazionale del Bargello'') in 1865,&lt;ref name=arch/&gt; displaying the largest Italian collection of [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] and [[Renaissance]] sculptures (14–17th century).

==Art collection==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5717">[[Image:EtomLevel0.png |thumb |upright=1.6 |An early version of the process model]]
The '''Business Process Framework''' is an [[Operating model|operating model framework]] for [[telecom service provider]]s in the [[telecommunication]]s industry.&lt;ref name="MB 2007"&gt;Brenner, Michael, et al. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=NUoZ7fKOITQC&amp;pg=PA871 Service Provisioning-Challenges, Process Alignment and Tool Support]." Bergstra, J. und M. Burgess (Herausgeber): Handbook of Network and System Administration. Elsevier (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The model describes the required business processes of [[service provider]]s, and defines key elements and how they should interact.

The Business Process Framework (eTOM) is a standard maintained by the [[TM Forum]],&lt;ref name="MB 2007"/&gt; an association for service providers and their suppliers in the telecommunications and entertainment industries.

== History ==
The development of the business process standardization for telecom service providers started with the founding of the TM Forum in 1988. The initial goal was to facilitate the creation of 'interoperable network management products'.&lt;ref name="ROR 2011"&gt;Robert Oebele Reitsma (2011) ''Innovating Mass-customized Service.'' p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; The first approved standard was the 'OSI/NM Forum Protocol Specification,' an extension of [[OSI protocols]] developed since the late 1970s.

The direct development towards the Business Process Framework (eTOM), as Brenner (2007) explained, was "the Telecom Operation Map (TOM) was first published in 2001. The goal of TOM was the creation of an industry-owned framework of business processes, including the definition of a common enterprise-independent terminology for service management. It was also supposed to serve as a basis for discussing the scope of information management necessary for the execution of the processes. The result of this latter effort has meanwhile spawned its own TMF document family, the [[Frameworx Shared Information/Data Model|Shared Information and Data Model]] (SID).&lt;ref name="MB 2007"/&gt;   

The Telecom Operation Map (TOM) was extended in 2001 to eTOM, an acronym for Enhanced Telecom Operations Map.&lt;ref name="MB 2007"/&gt; The process model eTOm was renamed "Enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM)," and in 2013 to "Business Process Framework (eTOM)." 

There have been many versions of eTOM. Version 14 was published in May 2014. It also has been developed into a component of [[NGOSS]], which has been renamed [[Frameworx]].

== Building blocks ==
=== Hierarchy ===
[[File:ETOM.jpg|thumb|Three levels of eTOM (text in Russian).]]
The Business Process Framework model consists of processes at 5 levels:
* Strategy, 
* Network Operations, 
* Level-2, 
* Level-3,
* Level-4. 
These levels form a hierarchy, with each level encapsulating a group of processes at the next level of detail.

=== Rows and columns ===
The graphic representation of a Business Process Framework (eTOM) model consists of rows and columns, the intersections of which denote specific business processes. 
* The top row includes customer facing activities such as marketing, 
* While the bottom row includes supplier facing and support activities. 
In this manner the Business Process Framework map covers the whole value chain. The map also indicates the interaction between processes.

=== Three broad sections ===
Business Process Framework (eTOM) processes fall into three major process areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/services/high-availability/white_paper_c11-541448.pdf|title=Introduction to eTOM White Paper|last=|first=|date=16 February 2017|website=www.cisco.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as shown in the diagram: 
* Strategy, Infrastructure &amp; Product (SIP), 
* Operations and 
* Enterprise Management. 
; Strategy, Infrastructure &amp; Product:
:; Columns
:: Strategy and Commit, Infrastructure Lifecycle Management and Product Lifecycle Management
:; Rows
:: Marketing &amp; Offer Management, Service Development &amp; Management, Resource Development &amp; Management and Supply Chain Development &amp; Management

; Operations
:; Columns
:: Operations Support &amp; Readiness, Fulfillment, Assurance and Billing
:; Rows
:: Customer Relationship Management, Service Management &amp; Operations, Resource Management &amp; Operations and Supplier/Partner Relationship Management.

== Other standards ==
* The [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library]] (ITIL) is an analogous standard or framework for best practices in [[information technology]]. 
* Both of these frameworks are part of [[Total Quality Management]], in which industries have, since 1950, formalized their business processes and metrics in search of higher quality, fewer defects, and greater efficiency.
* [[ISO 9000]] is another of these "process and results improvement" standards, but it is far more generic than either Business Process Framework or ITIL.  
* Business Process Framework has been adopted by the [[ITU-T]] as a Recommendation and published in the M.3050.x series.
* [[OpenReference]] is a business process framework developed for product and service businesses and includes processes, metrics and practices.

CSG maintains a publicly open library and archive, both relating to the [[history of homosexuality]] and [[LGBT social movements|activism]] in Germany, with a focus on the homosexual subcultures of Cologne and the [[Rhineland]]. Historic documents reach back as far as the 1230s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csgkoeln.de/Texte/Chronik1MA-FrueheNeuzeit.htm Chronicle of (male) homosexuality in Cologne], csgkoeln.de&lt;/ref&gt; but it has a more comprehensive inventory on magazines and other publications from the 20th century. Centrum Schwule Geschichte also organizes exhibitions, lectures and other presentations, while CSG's work has also been published in books and magazines. [[Invertito]] - Jahrbuch für die Geschichte der Homosexualitäten (Annual For The History Of Homosexualities) is co-owned by the organization.

The organisation was established in 1984 and maintains an office in the district of [[Kalk, Cologne|Kalk]]; its predecessor were the Rheinisches Schwulenarchiv and the Arbeitskreis schwule Geschichte.

Of non-legal obligations, '''collateral assurance''' is a [[Surety bond|bond]] made over and beyond the [[deed]] itself, for the performance of an agreement, or [[Covenant (law)|covenant]], made between two individuals; so called, for being external, and without the nature and essence of a covenant.  A collateral assurance is separate but subservient to the principal contract.  It usually allows for damages to be paid when the assurance is broken without allowing the principal agreement to be voided.  [[Warranties]] are examples of this sort of assurance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4119">The German '''''Commission E''''' is a scientific advisory board of the "Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte" formed in 1978. The commission gives scientific expertise for the approval of substances and products previously used in traditional, folk and herbal medicine.

The commission became known beyond Germany in the 1990s for compiling and publishing 380 monographs evaluating the safety and efficacy of herbs for licensed medical prescribing in Germany. The monographs were published between 1984 and 1994 in the ''[[Bundesanzeiger]]''; they were not updated since then but are still considered valid. A summary of the publications is available on the website of the commission; unofficial copies of the monographs are available at the ''Heilpflanzen-Welt Bibliothek''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buecher.heilpflanzen-welt.de/BGA-Kommission-E-Monographien/ buecher.heilpflanzen-welt.de]&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is an English translation&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete German Commission E Monographs, Therapeutic Guide to Herbal Medicines'', 1st ed. 1998, Integrative Medicine Communications, pub; Bk&amp;CD-Rom edition, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; by the '''American Botanical Council'''.

==Criticism concerning the American version of the monographs==
The Commission E monographs were imported into the United States with considerable fanfare in 1998 by The American Botanical Council. They were unequivocally endorsed in a [[foreword]] by [[Varro Eugene Tyler]], a professor of [[pharmacognosy]] at [[Purdue University]]. Tyler states in his foreword that ''"...safety data were reviewed by the Commissioners according to a "doctrine of absolute proof" and efficacy according to a "doctrine of reasonable certainty''." 

{{quote|"Certainly worth studying, the Commission E monographs detail which herbs are approved or disapproved, along with their uses, dosages, [[contraindication]]s, adverse effects, drug interactions, and pharmacologic actions. The therapeutic, [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]], and chemical indexes are helpful, as is the glossary." -- [[Journal of the American Medical Association]], 1999&lt;ref name="jama"&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |date=19 May 1999 |volume=281 |issue=19 |pages=1852&amp;ndash;1853 |title=Book review: The Complete German Commission E Monographs: Therapeutic Guide to Herbal Medicines |doi=10.1001/jama.281.19.1852-JBK0519-2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 1998 book mentioned 10 but omitted 11 possible fatal reactions to the medicines described.&lt;ref name="jama"/&gt;

"All [of the monographs] lack literature references. . .."&lt;ref name="jama"/&gt;

The best known critic of ''Commission E'' is Jonathan Treasure, MNIMH, a UK-licensed medical herbalist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jonathan |last=Treasure |url=http://www.botanicalmedicine.org/Tapes/Bios/Treasure.htm |title=Author's biography |publisher= Herbal Educational Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; and author of numerous herbalism monographs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henriettesherbal.com/archives/best/authors/jonathan-treasure.html henriettesherbal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Treasure's lengthy review&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herbological.com/commisione_review.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419132824/http://www.herbological.com/commisione_review.htm |archive-date=2012-04-19 |title=Making Sense of Commission E|first=Jonathan |last=Treasure |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; (31 K) offers detailed evidence that the book is not a work of science, medicine, or [[vitalist]] herbalism. Rather, it is a book of German legal-medical regulations, since "In Germany, only those herbs with Commission E Approved status are (or will eventually become) legally available."

'''''Complete Warrior''''' is a supplemental rulebook for the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Dungeons &amp; Dragons v3.5|3.5 edition]] of the ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]], published by [[Wizards of the Coast]]. It replaces and expands upon an earlier rulebook entitled ''[[Sword and Fist]]''.

==Contents==
''Complete Warrior'' presents additional rules and advice for the creation and use of character classes which specialize in [[melee]] and ranged combat. It also provides a catchall for anything that doesn't fit into ''[[Complete Adventurer]]'', ''[[Complete Divine]]'', ''[[Complete Arcane]]'', or ''[[Complete Psionic]]''.

== New character classes ==

===Hexblade===
The Hexblade mixes martial prowess with a unique curse ability, the ability to cast arcane spells and good resistance against spells and spell effects. Similar in concept to the [[Sorcerer (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|sorcerer]], the Hexblade is an individual who possesses unnatural jinxes or an evil eye, and uses it towards combat. With a d10 for hit points, a 1/1 base attack bonus advancement, and a very slow spell advancement, the hexblade is more like an arcane [[Ranger (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|ranger]] or [[Paladin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|paladin]] than a [[Bard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|bard]].

===Samurai===
The [[Samurai (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Samurai]] is a brave and noble warrior, possessing martial prowess and unique abilities to intimidate and terrify his opponents. Like the other classes, the Samurai has a d10 for hit points and a 1/1 base attack bonus advancement. The main drawback to playing a Samurai is the restrictions placed on the class. A Samurai cannot multiclass, then resume being a Samurai, some of his class abilities require him to use specific weaponry, and he is bound by the code of Bushido, which operates in a similar manner to the Paladin's code.

:[http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cwc/20050325a Samurai Pros and Cons (Wizards of the Coast)]

===Swashbuckler===
The Swashbuckler is a fighter that emphasizes finesse, style and flair, combining martial prowess with amazing acrobatics to outmaneuver opponents. With a d10 for hit points and a 1/1 base attack bonus advancement, the swashbuckler is an effective frontline fighter, and while the inability to wear medium or heavy armours makes the character vulnerable to counterattacks, some of the class features compensate. The ability to deal strength (weakness critical class feature) and constitution damage (wounding critical class feature), as well as the ability to charge in difficult terrains (acrobatic charge class feature) makes the swashbuckler a formidable opponent in any battle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cwc/20050714a&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
''Complete Warrior'' was written by [[Andy Collins (game designer)|Andy Collins]], [[David Noonan (game designer)|David Noonan]], and [[Ed Stark]], and was published in November 2003. Cover art is by [[Wayne Reynolds]], with interior art by [[Brent Chumley]], [[Ed Cox (artist)|Ed Cox]], [[Wayne England]], [[Rebecca Guay|Rebecca Guay-Mitchell]], [[Jeremy Jarvis]], [[Doug Kovacs]], [[Ginger Kubic]], [[John and Laura Lakey]], [[David L. Martin|David Martin]], [[Dennis Crabapple McClain]], [[Matthew Mitchell (artist)|Matt Mitchell]], [[Steve Prescott (artist)|Steve Prescott]], Wayne Reynolds, [[David Roach (comics)|David Roach]], [[Mark Smylie]], [[Brian Snoddy]], [[Ron Spencer]], and [[Joel Thomas (artist)|Joel Thomas]].

As this book is not intended only for [[Fighter (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|fighters]], David Noonan clarified that ''Complete Warrior'' would be useful for: "In short, anybody who makes attack rolls. That's often the fighter, of course, but there's something in ''Complete Warrior'' for the polymorphed wizard, the wild-shaped druid, and any number of archetypes who don't trundle around in heavy armor heaving a big battleaxe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ps/20031205a| title=Product Spotlight: Complete Warrior| date=December 5, 2003| publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]| accessdate=August 11, 2013| last=Ryan| first=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Connaissance des temps''''' (English: Knowledge of Time) is an official yearly publication of astronomical [[ephemerides]] in France. Until just after the [[French Revolution]], the title appeared as '''''Connoissance des temps''''', and for several years afterwards as '''''Connaissance des tems'''''.

== History ==
''Connaissance des temps'' is the oldest such publication in the world, published without interruption since 1679 (originally named  ''La Connoissance des Temps ou calendrier et éphémérides du lever &amp; coucher du Soleil, de la Lune &amp; des autres planètes''), when the astronomer Jean Picard  (1620–1682) obtained from the King the right to create the journal. The first eight editors were:

*1679–1684: [[Jean Picard]] (1620–1682)
*1685–1701: [[Jean Le Fèvre (astronomer)|Jean Le Fèvre]] (1650–1706)
*1702–1729: Jacques Lieutaud (1660–1733)
*1730–1734: [[Louis Godin]] (1704–1760)
*1735–1759: [[Giovanni Domenico Maraldi]] (1709–1788)
*1760–1775: [[Joseph Jérôme Lefrançois de Lalande]] (1732–1807)
*1776–1787: [[Edme-Sébastien Jeaurat]] (1725–1803)
*1788–1794: [[Pierre Méchain]] (1744–1804)

Other notable astronomers who edited the ''Connaissance des temps'' were:

*[[Alexis Bouvard]] (1767–1843)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=July 15, 2015 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58193.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bureau des Longitudes]]
**[[Rodolphe Radau]] (1835–1911)
**[[Marie Henri Andoyer]] (1862–1929)

Among the other prestigious national astronomical ephemerides, ''[[The Nautical Almanac]]'' was established in 1767 and the ''[[Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch]]'' in 1776.

== Contents ==
The volumes of the ''Connaissance des temps'' had two parts:
* a section of ephemerides, containing various tables
* articles giving a deeper coverage of various topics, often written by famous astronomers

A '''cruise book''' is a [[yearbook]]-style publication often produced by ships of the [[United States Navy]] upon completion of a long [[Military deployment|deployment]] (typically six months or more). The books typically contain photos of all the people who were aboard during the cruise, usually grouped by their division or department. There are often candid photos as well, showing the people at work aboard the ship. Often there is a map or a description of the ship's travels during the cruise, and there are almost always pictures taken at the various ports of call.&lt;ref name='NavyLibrary'&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/special/cruise_main.htm |title=Cruise Books |accessdate=2014-02-26 |author=Naval History &amp; Heritage Command |publisher=[[Naval History &amp; Heritage Command]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On large ships, the books are produced on board by the ship's Morale, Welfare and Recreation department and Public Affairs staff, and are then printed ashore by printing companies that specialize in such services. The cruise book of a [[Nimitz-class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz''-class aircraft carrier]] typically reaches over 600 pages in length, as it includes portraits of the more than 5,000 sailors and [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] assigned to the ship's company and embarked carrier air wing.

Cruise books of smaller ships are typically much smaller, often 50–100 pages, and are produced informally by volunteers. They are printed ashore by the same companies that specialize in cruise book publication firms that also handle the larger ships.

USMC units also have a long-standing tradition of doing cruise books for deployments.  Many units do so remotely from their deployed location, allowing them to proof the books prior to final printing. This is usually done by allowing the publisher to maintain a website where the pages are displayed to be viewed by anyone in the unit and then giving feedback. 

The Navy Department Library has a collection of over 8,000 cruise books and similar Navy yearbooks, dating from the [[Spanish–American War]] to the present. Cruise books from many [[Seabee]] units are included in the collection. The Navy Department Library accepts donations of cruise books from all time periods.&lt;ref name='USNList'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/special/cruise_list.htm |title=Cruise Books In the Navy Department Library's Collection |accessdate=2014-02-26 |author=The Navy Department Library |publisher=[[Naval History &amp; Heritage Command]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='SeabeeList'&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/guides/seabee_list.htm |title=Seabee Unit Cruise Books in the Navy Department Library |accessdate=2014-02-26 |author=Naval History &amp; Heritage Command |publisher=[[Naval History &amp; Heritage Command]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private collectors exist throughout the world, with an example being a site run by Retired Command Master Chief Dillard. He has been collecting these books since the 1970s and is attempting to document every USN/USCG ship cruise book ever published. So far, he has determined that there have been at least 7,844 ship cruise books published. He has managed to have documented 3,965 of them and collected scans of the front covers of 5,797 of these cruise books. In addition to having 1,970 ship cruise books in his personal collection, he also has over 4,000 individual ship files—roughly seven file cabinets full—containing photos and other historical data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uss-king.com/Cruise_books/Rick%20dillard.pdf |title=Cruise book chronicler solving 'jigsaw puzzle' of naval history |accessdate=2014-02-26 |last=Christenson |first=David |work=The Old Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Entomology is a research department and collection unit of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History]] (NMNH), located in [[Washington, DC]]. The department houses the U.S. National Insect Collection, one of the largest entomological collections in the world, with over 35 million specimens housed in 132,354 drawers, 33,000 jars or vials, and 23,000 slides in more than 5,200 cabinets. The department also includes research scientists and technical staff from the  [[Smithsonian Institution]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] Systematic Entomology Lab (SEL) &lt;ref&gt;USDA Systematics Entomology Lab. http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/site_main.htm?modecode=12-45-49-00&lt;/ref&gt; and [[United States Department of Defense]] [[Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit]] (WRBU).&lt;ref&gt;Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit. http://www.wrbu.org/index.html WRBU&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:NMNHEntomologyColln.jpg|thumb|Open cabinets highlighting Department of Entomology collections at the National Museum of Natural History.

== History ==

Prior to 1862, the U. S. government’s entomological work for agriculture was handled by the [[United States Patent Office]]. With the establishment of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA)  in 1862, the responsibility was transferred to the newly appointed USDA Chief Entomologist, [[Townend Glover]]. When he retired  in 1877, he was succeeded by [[Charles Valentine Riley]], who resigned in 1879 after a personal disagreement and was replaced with [[John Henry Comstock]]. Riley was reinstated as USDA Chief Entomologist in 1881, and was then also appointed Honorary Curator of the newly created Division of Insects at the United States National Museum (USNM). Although the USNM had been established in 1842. 4 years before the founding of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], insufficient funding at the time led to the Smithsonian’s insect collection being distributed to collaborating scientists, with the understanding that the material could be reclaimed.

In the 1870s, the USDA became the repository for the Smithsonian insect collection, which was added to the USDA collection. Upon Riley’s appointment as Honorary Curator, the USDA insect collection was officially transferred to the USNM. The first salaried Smithsonian entomologist was the lepidopterist [[John B. Smith (entomologist)|John B. Smith]], who served as assistant curator from 1885 to April 1889. With the donation of Riley’s personal collection (by Riley's account, 115,000 pinned specimens, 2,850 vials of alcohol material, and 3,000 slides of minute insects, for an estimated total of 150,000 specimens and 20,000 species) in 1886, the USNM insect collection achieved status as a major entomological depository. Riley was succeeded as USDA Chief Entomologist and Honorary Curator by [[Leland Ossian Howard]], who served until 1927. In 1925, taxonomic work was established as a separate Bureau of Entomology within USDA, and underwent a series of names and reorganizations before becoming the  Systematic Entomology Laboratory &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/site_main.htm?modecode=12-45-49-00&lt;/ref&gt; in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;http://entomology.si.edu/documents/USNationalInsectCollection1976.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Defense joined  in 1961 because of the impact of mosquito-borne disease on national defense and public health.

== Collections ==

The U. S. National Insect Collection is the second largest insect collection in the world, with approximately 35 million specimens representing over 300,000 species. The collection includes over 100,000 [[holotype]]s and many additional [[paratype]]s and secondary types. The size and quality of the [[Nearctic]] and [[Neotropical]] collections are unparalleled, but there are specimens from all over the world, with especially strong representation from Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea. The specimens represent approximately 60% of the known insect families, with especially strong collections of butterflies and moths, flies, mosquitoes, beetles, and wasps. The majority of the collection is pinned or point-mounted and stored dry in drawers, but there are also many specimens housed in alcohol, on slides, and in envelopes.

The entomological collections are primarily housed at the [[National Museum of Natural History]] in downtown [[Washington, DC]] (70%), the NMNH [[Museum Support Center]] (MSC) in [[Suitland, MD]] (20%), and the [[Beltsville Agricultural Research Center]] (BARC) in [[Beltsville, MD]] (10%).&lt;ref&gt;SI Entomology Collections. http://entomology.si.edu/Collections.html&lt;/ref&gt; The collections are loaned to qualified scientists and students around the world, and the department hosts visiting scientists who come to study the collections on-site. The department also houses the Entomology Illustration Archives, approximately 6000 illustrations originally created to support the department's research and publications but now housed and conserved separately as historically significant art objects.&lt;ref&gt;SI Illustration Archives. http://entomology.si.edu/IllustrationArchives.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the Department of Entomology has also established a non-illustration archive for physical objects, field and laboratory research notebooks and materials, and for correspondence of entomology researchers and staff based at the NMNH from all three agencies, as well as similar items accompanying donated collections.

== Staff ==

As of 2013, the combined Department of Entomology (including SI,&lt;ref&gt;SI Entomology. http://entomology.si.edu/default.html&lt;/ref&gt; USDA,&lt;ref&gt;USDA Systematics Entomology Laboratory. http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/site_main.htm?modecode=12-45-49-00&lt;/ref&gt; and DOD &lt;ref&gt;Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit. http://www.wrbu.org/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;) employs about 80 permanent full-time staff and a variable number of research associates, postdoctoral and predoctoral fellows, students, and volunteers.

‘Former inner city’
}}
The '''Forbidden City''' is a [[palace]] complex in central [[Beijing]], China. The former Chinese imperial palace from the [[Ming dynasty]] to the end of the [[Qing dynasty]] (the years 1420 to 1912), it now houses the '''Palace Museum'''. The Forbidden City served as the home of [[Emperor of China|emperors]] and their households as well as the ceremonial and political center of Chinese government for almost 500 years.

Constructed from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings&lt;ref name="palace rooms"&gt;{{cite news|script-title=zh:故宫到底有多少间房 |trans-title=How many rooms in the Forbidden City |url=https://www.singtaonet.com/arts/t20060927_343639.html |publisher=Singtao Net |date=2006-09-27 |accessdate=2007-07-05 |language=zh-hans |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718140600/https://www.singtaonet.com/arts/t20060927_343639.html |archivedate=18 July 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and covers 72 hectares (over 180 [[acres]]).&lt;ref name="Lu"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lu|first=Yongxiang|title=A History of Chinese Science and Technology, Volume 3|year=2014|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=3-662-44163-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO-ABE"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/439bis.pdf|title=Advisory Body Evaluation (1987)|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The palace exemplifies traditional [[Chinese architecture|Chinese palatial architecture]],&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/439|title=UNESCO World Heritage List: Imperial Palaces of the Ming and Qing Dynasties in Beijing and Shenyang|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has influenced cultural and architectural developments in [[East Asia]] and elsewhere. The Forbidden City was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1987,&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt; and is listed by [[UNESCO]] as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world.

Since 1925, the Forbidden City has been under the charge of the Palace Museum, whose extensive collection of artwork and artifacts were built upon the imperial collections of the Ming and Qing dynasties. Part of the museum's former collection is now in the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]]. Both museums descend from the same institution, but were split after the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Since 2012, the Forbidden City has seen an average of 15 million visitors annually, and received more than 16 million visitors in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Visitors to Beijing Palace Museum Topped 16 Million in 2016, An Average of 40,000 Every Day|url=https://www.thebeijinger.com/blog/2017/01/03/2016-visitors-beijing-palace-museum-topped-16-million-average-40001-every-day|work=www.thebeijinger.com|date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2017.&lt;ref name=visitors /&gt;

== Name ==
The common English name "Forbidden City" is a translation of the Chinese name ''Zijin Cheng'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|紫|禁|城}}|p=Zǐjìnchéng|l=Purple Forbidden City}}). The name ''Zijin Cheng'' first formally appeared in 1576.&lt;ref&gt;p26, Barmé, Geremie R (2008). The Forbidden City. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Another English name of similar origin is "Forbidden Palace".&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite journal|title=Perspective of urban land use in Beijing|journal=GeoJournal|date=April 1990|first=Guo-hui|last=Gan|volume=20|issue=4|pages=359–364|doi=10.1007/bf00174975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "''Zijin Cheng''" is a name with significance on many levels. ''Zi'', or "Purple", refers to the [[North Star]], which in ancient China was called the ''Ziwei'' Star, and in traditional [[Chinese astrology]] was the heavenly abode of the [[Celestial Emperor]]. The surrounding celestial region, the [[Three enclosures|Ziwei Enclosure]] ({{zh|c={{linktext|紫|微|垣}}|p=Zǐwēiyuán}}), was the realm of the Celestial Emperor and his family. The Forbidden City, as the residence of the terrestrial emperor, was its earthly counterpart. ''Jin'', or "''Forbidden''", referred to the fact that no one could enter or leave the palace without the emperor's permission. ''Cheng'' means a city.&lt;ref name="Yu 18" /&gt;

Today, the site is most commonly known in Chinese as ''Gùgōng'' ({{linktext|故|宫}}), which means the "Former Palace".&lt;ref&gt;"Gùgōng" in a generic sense also refers to all former palaces, another prominent example being the former Imperial Palaces ([[Mukden Palace]]) in [[Shenyang]]; see [[Gugong (disambiguation)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The museum which is based in these buildings is known as the "Palace Museum" ({{zh|c={{linktext|故|宫|博|物|院}}|p=Gùgōng Bówùyùan}}).

When [[Hongwu Emperor]]'s son [[Zhu Di]] became the [[Yongle Emperor]], he moved the capital from [[Nanjing]] to Beijing, and construction began in 1406 on what would become the Forbidden City.&lt;ref name="Yu 18"&gt;p. 18, {{cite book|last=Yu|first=Zhuoyun|title=Palaces of the Forbidden City|year=1984|publisher=Viking|location=New York|isbn=0-670-53721-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction lasted 14 years and required more than a million workers.&lt;ref name="Yang 15"&gt;p. 15, {{cite book|last=Yang|first=Xiagui|others=Li, Shaobai (photography); Chen, Huang (translation)|title=The Invisible Palace|year=2003|publisher=Foreign Language Press|location=Beijing|isbn=7-119-03432-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Material used include whole logs of precious ''[[Phoebe zhennan]]'' wood ({{zh|c={{linktext|楠|木}}|p=nánmù}}) found in the jungles of south-western China, and large blocks of marble from quarries near Beijing.&lt;ref name="CCTV"&gt;{{cite video|people=China Central Television, The Palace Museum|date=2005|url=https://www.cctv.com/history/special/C15041/01/index.shtml|title=Gugong: "I.

From 1420 to 1644, the Forbidden City was the seat of the Ming dynasty. In April 1644, it was captured by rebel forces led by [[Li Zicheng]], who proclaimed himself emperor of the [[Shun dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 69, Yang (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; He soon fled before the combined armies of former Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] and [[Manchu]] forces, setting fire to parts of the Forbidden City in the process.&lt;ref&gt;p. 3734, {{cite book|last=Wu|first=Han|authorlink=Wu Han (PRC)|title=朝鲜李朝实录中的中国史料 (Chinese historical material in the Annals of the Joseon Yi dynasty)|year=1980|publisher=Zhonghua Book Company|location=Beijing|id=CN / D829.312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By October, the Manchus had achieved supremacy in northern China, and a ceremony was held at the Forbidden City to proclaim the young [[Shunzhi Emperor]] as ruler of all China under the [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Muoruo|last=Guo|authorlink=Guo Moruo|title=甲申三百年祭 (Commemorating 300th anniversary of the Jia-Sheng Year)|work=New China Daily|date=1944-03-20|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Qing rulers changed the names on some of the principal buildings, to emphasise "Harmony" rather than "Supremacy",&lt;ref name="CCTV2" /&gt; made the [[Nameplate|name plates]] bilingual (Chinese and [[Manchu language|Manchu]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=故宫外朝宫殿为何无满文？ (Why is there no Manchu on the halls of the Outer Court?) |url=https://ha.people.com.cn/news/2006/06/16/109613.htm |work=People Net |date=2006-06-16 |accessdate=2007-07-12 |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201185034/https://ha.people.com.cn/news/2006/06/16/109613.htm |archivedate=1 December 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced [[Shamanism|Shamanist]] elements to the palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://125.35.3.4/China/phoweb/BuildingPage/1/B488.htm |title=坤宁宫 (Palace of Earthly Tranquility) |accessdate=2007-07-12 |author=Zhou Suqin |publisher=The Palace Museum |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095215/https://125.35.3.4/China/phoweb/BuildingPage/1/B488.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, during the [[Second Opium War]], Anglo-French forces took control of the Forbidden City and occupied it until the end of the war.&lt;ref name="CCTV11"&gt;{{cite video|people=China Central Television, The Palace Museum|date=2005|url=https://www.cctv.com/history/special/C15041/01/index.shtml|title=Gugong: "XI.

[[File:Forbiddencity notopen06.JPG|thumb|The East Glorious Gate under renovation as part of the 16-year restoration process]]

After being the home of 24 emperors – 14 of the Ming dynasty and 10 of the Qing dynasty – the Forbidden City ceased being the political centre of China in 1912 with the abdication of [[Puyi]], the last Emperor of China. Under an agreement with the new Republic of China government, Puyi remained in the Inner Court, while the Outer Court was given over to public use,&lt;ref&gt;p. 137, Yang (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; until he was evicted after a coup in 1924.&lt;ref name="Yan4"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yan|first=Chongnian|authorlink=Yan Chongnian|title=正说清朝十二帝 (True Stories of the Twelve Qing Emperors)|url=https://culture.people.com.cn/GB/40472/55544/55547/55560/3875789.html|year=2004|publisher=Zhonghua Book Company|location=Beijing|isbn=7-101-04445-X|language=Chinese|chapter=国民—战犯—公民 (National – War criminal – Citizen)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Palace Museum was then established in the Forbidden City in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Cao Kun|title=故宫X档案: 开院门票 掏五毛钱可劲逛 (Forbidden City X-Files: Opening admission 50 cents)|url=https://culture.people.com.cn/GB/22226/53974/53977/3750782.html|work=Beijing Legal Evening|publisher=People Net|date=2005-10-06|accessdate=2007-07-25|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1933, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] forced the evacuation of the national treasures in the Forbidden City.&lt;ref&gt;See map of the evacuation routes at: {{cite web|url=https://www.npm.gov.tw/en/administration/about/tradition.htm|title=National Palace Museum – Tradition &amp; Continuity|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=National Palace Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Part of the collection was returned at the end of [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npm.gov.tw/en/administration/about/tradition.htm|title=National Palace Museum – Tradition &amp; Continuity|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=National Palace Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the other part was evacuated to Taiwan in 1948 under orders by [[Chiang Kai-shek]], whose [[Kuomintang]] was losing the Chinese Civil War. This relatively small but high quality collection was kept in storage until 1965, when it again became public, as the core of the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]].&lt;ref name="Three"&gt;{{cite news|title=三大院长南京说文物 (Three museum directors talk artefacts in Nanjing)|url=https://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper447/10416/949293.html|work=Jiangnan Times|publisher=People Net|date=2003-10-19|accessdate=2007-07-05|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201133727/https://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper447/10416/949293.html|archivedate=1 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, some damage was done to the Forbidden City as the country was swept up in revolutionary zeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jie|last=Chen|title=故宫曾有多种可怕改造方案 (Several horrifying reconstruction proposals had been made for the Forbidden City)|url=https://news.eastday.com/eastday/node81741/node81803/node112035/userobject1ai1829390.html|work=Yangcheng Evening News|publisher=Eastday|date=2006-02-04|accessdate=2007-05-01|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cultural Revolution]], however, further destruction was prevented when Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] sent an army battalion to guard the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Yinming|last=Xie|author2=Qu, Wanlin|title="文化大革命"中谁保护了故宫 (Who protected the Forbidden City in the Cultural Revolution?)|url=https://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/68742/69115/69120/5005812.html|work=CPC Documents|publisher=People Net|date=2006-11-07|accessdate=2007-07-25|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forbidden City was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1987 by [[UNESCO]] as the "Imperial Palace of the Ming and Qing Dynasties",&lt;ref&gt;The Forbidden City was listed as the "[https://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/439.pdf Imperial Palace of the Ming and Qing Dynasties]" (Official Document). In 2004, [[Mukden Palace]] in [[Shenyang]] was added as an extension item to the property, which then became known as "Imperial Palaces of the Ming and Qing Dynasties in Beijing and Shenyang": {{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/439|title=UNESCO World Heritage List: Imperial Palaces of the Ming and Qing Dynasties in Beijing and Shenyang|accessdate=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
due to its significant place in the development of [[Chinese architecture]] and culture.

The Forbidden City is a rectangle, with {{convert|961|m|ft}} from north to south and {{convert|753|m|ft}} from east to west.&lt;ref name="Lu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO-ABE" /&gt; It consists of 980 surviving buildings with 8,886 bays of rooms.&lt;ref name=Oakland&gt;{{cite web|url=https://museumca.org/exhibit/exhib_fc2.html |title=Amazing Facts About the Forbidden City |publisher=[[Oakland Museum of California]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614204459/https://museumca.org/exhibit/exhib_fc2.html |archivedate=14 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As larger buildings in traditional Chinese architecture are easily and regularly sub-divided into different configurations, the number of rooms in the Forbidden City is traditionally counted in terms of "bays" of rooms, with each bay being the space defined by four structural pillars.&lt;/ref&gt; A common myth states that there are [[9999 (number)|9,999]] rooms including antechambers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/31/arts/art-review-they-had-expensive-tastes.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=ART REVIEW; They Had Expensive Tastes|author=Glueck, Grace|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=2001-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on oral tradition, and it is not supported by survey evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.china.org.cn/english/culture/217858.htm|title=Numbers Inside the Forbidden City|author=''China Daily''|publisher=China.org.cn|date=2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Forbidden City was designed to be the centre of the ancient, walled city of Beijing. It is enclosed in a larger, walled area called the [[Imperial City (Beijing)|Imperial City]]. The Imperial City is, in turn, enclosed by the Inner City; to its south lies the Outer City.

The Forbidden City remains important in the civic scheme of Beijing. The central north–south axis remains the central axis of Beijing. This axis extends to the south through Tiananmen gate to [[Tiananmen Square]], the ceremonial centre of the People's Republic of China, and on to [[Yongdingmen]]. To the north, it extends through [[Jingshan Park|Jingshan Hill]] to [[Gulou and Zhonglou|the Bell and Drum Towers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=zh:北京确立城市发展脉络 重塑7.8公里中轴线 |trans-title=Beijing to establish civic development network; Recreating 7.8&amp;nbsp;km central axis|url=https://house.people.com.cn/chengshi/20060530/article_5338.html|publisher=People Net|date=2006-05-30|accessdate=2007-07-05|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; This axis is not exactly aligned north–south, but is tilted by slightly more than two degrees. Researchers now believe that the axis was designed in the [[Yuan dynasty]] to be aligned with [[Shangdu|Xanadu]], the other capital of their empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Feng|last=Pan |script-title=zh:探秘北京中轴线 |trans-title=Exploring the mystery of Beijing's Central Axis |url=https://www.cas.ac.cn/html/Dir/2005/03/02/5202.htm|work=Science Times|publisher=[[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]|date=2005-03-02|accessdate=2007-10-19|language=Chinese|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071211101908/https://www.cas.ac.cn/html/Dir/2005/03/02/5202.htm |archivedate = 2007-12-11|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Walls and gates ===
[[File:Meridian Gate, Beijing.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Meridian Gate]], front entrance to the Forbidden City, with two protruding wings]]

[[File:Forbiden city-Beijing-China - panoramio (18).jpg|thumb|left|Close-up on the left protruding wing of the Meridian Gate.]]

[[File:Corner towers of the Forbidden City 3335.jpg|thumb|left|Corner tower of the Forbidden City]]

The Forbidden City is surrounded by a {{convert|7.9|m|ft}} high [[Chinese city wall|city wall]]&lt;ref name="CCTV2"&gt;{{cite video|people=China Central Television, The Palace Museum|date=2005|url=https://www.cctv.com/history/special/C15041/01/index.shtml|title=Gugong: "II. Ridgeline of a Prosperous Age"|medium=Documentary|location=China|publisher=CCTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a {{convert|6|m|ft}} deep by {{convert|52|m|ft}} wide [[moat]]. The walls are {{convert|8.62|m|ft}} wide at the base, tapering to {{convert|6.66|m|ft}} at the top.&lt;ref name="Yang 25"&gt;p. 25, Yang (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; These walls served as both [[defensive wall]]s and [[retaining wall]]s for the palace. They were constructed with a [[rammed earth]] core, and surfaced with three layers of specially baked bricks on both sides, with the interstices filled with mortar.&lt;ref name="Yu 32"&gt;p. 32, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the four corners of the wall sit towers (E) with intricate roofs boasting 72 ridges, reproducing the [[Pavilion of Prince Teng]] and the [[Yellow Crane Tower|Yellow Crane Pavilion]] as they appeared in [[Song dynasty]] paintings.&lt;ref name="Yu 32" /&gt; These towers are the most visible parts of the palace to commoners outside the walls, and much folklore is attached to them. According to one legend, artisans could not put a corner tower back together after it was dismantled for renovations in the early Qing dynasty, and it was only rebuilt after the intervention of carpenter-immortal [[Lu Ban]].&lt;ref name="CCTV2" /&gt;

The wall is pierced by a gate on each side. At the southern end is the main [[Meridian Gate]] (A).&lt;ref&gt;Technically, Tiananmen Gate is not part of the Forbidden City; it is a gate of the [[Imperial City (Beijing)|Imperial City]].&lt;/ref&gt; To the north is the [[Gate of Divine Might]] (B), which faces Jingshan Park. The east and west gates are called the "East Glorious Gate" (D) and "West Glorious Gate" (C). All gates in the Forbidden City are decorated with a nine-by-nine array of golden door nails, except for the East Glorious Gate, which has only eight rows.&lt;ref name="Yu 25"&gt;p. 25, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Meridian Gate has two protruding wings forming three sides of a square (Wumen, or Meridian Gate, Square) before it.&lt;ref name="Yu 33"&gt;p. 33, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The gate has five gateways. The central gateway is part of the Imperial Way, a stone flagged path that forms the central axis of the Forbidden City and the ancient city of Beijing itself, and leads all the way from the [[Gate of China, Beijing|Gate of China]] in the south to [[Jingshan Park|Jingshan]] in the north. Only the Emperor may walk or ride on the Imperial Way, except for the Empress on the occasion of her wedding, and successful students after the [[Imperial Examination]].&lt;ref name="Yu 25" /&gt;

=== Outer Court or the Southern Section ===

[[File:北京故宫2.JPG|thumb|The Golden Water River, an artificial stream that runs through the Forbidden City.]]

Traditionally, the Forbidden City is divided into two parts. The Outer Court ({{linktext|外|朝}}) or Front Court ({{linktext|前|朝}}) includes the southern sections, and was used for ceremonial purposes. The [[#Inner Court|Inner Court]] ({{linktext|内|廷}}) or Back Palace ({{linktext|后|宫}}) includes the northern sections, and was the residence of the Emperor and his family, and was used for day-to-day affairs of state. (The approximate dividing line shown as red dash in the plan above.) Generally, the Forbidden City has three vertical axes. The most important buildings are situated on the central north–south axis.&lt;ref name="Yu 25" /&gt;

Entering from the Meridian Gate, one encounters a large square, pierced by the meandering Inner Golden Water River, which is crossed by five bridges. Beyond the square stands the [[Gate of Supreme Harmony]] (F). Behind that is the Hall of Supreme Harmony Square.&lt;ref name="Yu 49" /&gt; A three-tiered white marble terrace rises from this square. Three halls stand on top of this terrace, the focus of the palace complex. From the south, these are the [[Hall of Supreme Harmony]] ({{linktext|太|和|殿}}), the [[Hall of Central Harmony]] ({{linktext|中|和|殿}}), and the [[Hall of Preserving Harmony]] ({{linktext|保|和|殿}}).&lt;ref name="Yu 48"&gt;p. 48, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hall of Supreme Harmony 2018. Forbidden City.jpg|thumb|Hall of Supreme Harmony, 2018]]
The Hall of Supreme Harmony (G) is the largest, and rises some {{convert|30|m|ft}} above the level of the surrounding square. It is the ceremonial centre of imperial power, and the largest surviving wooden structure in China. It is nine bays wide and five bays deep, the numbers 9 and 5 being symbolically connected to the majesty of the Emperor.&lt;ref name="DPM Elements"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dpm.org.cn/ |title=Yin, Yang and the Five Elements in the Forbidden City |accessdate=2007-07-05 |author=The Palace Museum |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701213540/https://www.dpm.org.cn/ |archivedate=1 July 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Set into the ceiling at the centre of the hall is an intricate [[caisson (Asian architecture)|caisson]] decorated with a coiled dragon, from the mouth of which issues a chandelier-like set of metal balls, called the "[[Yellow Emperor|Xuanyuan]] Mirror".&lt;ref name="Yu 253"&gt;p. 253, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ming dynasty, the Emperor held court here to discuss affairs of state. During the Qing dynasty, as Emperors held court far more frequently, a less ceremonious location was used instead, and the Hall of Supreme Harmony was only used for ceremonial purposes, such as [[coronation]]s, [[investiture]]s, and imperial weddings.&lt;ref name="DPM Taihedian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dpm.org.cn/china/c/c2/c2a.htm |title=太和殿 (Hall of Supreme Harmony) |accessdate=2007-07-25 |author=The Palace Museum |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617181501/https://www.dpm.org.cn/China/c/c2/c2a.htm |archivedate=17 June 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hall of Central Harmony is a smaller, square hall, used by the Emperor to prepare and rest before and during ceremonies.&lt;ref name="DPM Zhonghedian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dpm.org.cn/China/phoweb/BuildingPage/1/B484.htm |title=中和殿 (Hall of Central Harmony) |accessdate=2007-07-25 |author=The Palace Museum |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070530064123/https://www.dpm.org.cn/China/phoweb/BuildingPage/1/B484.htm |archivedate=30 May 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Behind it, the Hall of Preserving Harmony, was used for rehearsing ceremonies, and was also the site of the final stage of the [[Imperial examination]].&lt;ref name="DPM Baohedian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dpm.org.cn/China/phoweb/BuildingPage/1/B396.htm |title=保和殿 (Hall of Preserving Harmony) |accessdate=2007-07-25 |author=The Palace Museum |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930160611/https://www.dpm.org.cn/China/phoweb/BuildingPage/1/B396.htm |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three halls feature imperial thrones, the largest and most elaborate one being that in the [[Hall of Supreme Harmony]].&lt;ref name="Yu 70"&gt;p. 70, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the centre of the ramps leading up to the terraces from the northern and southern sides are ceremonial ramps, part of the Imperial Way, featuring elaborate and symbolic [[bas-relief]] carvings. The northern ramp, behind the Hall of Preserving Harmony, is carved from a single piece of stone {{convert|16.57|m|ft}} long, {{convert|3.07|m|ft}} wide, and {{convert|1.7|m|ft}} thick. It weighs some 200&amp;nbsp;tonnes and is the largest such carving in China.&lt;ref name="Yang 15" /&gt; The southern ramp, in front of the [[Hall of Supreme Harmony]], is even longer, but is made from two stone slabs joined together – the joint was ingeniously hidden using overlapping bas-relief carvings, and was only discovered when weathering widened the gap in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Yu 213"&gt;For an explanation and illustration of the joint, see p. 213, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the south west and south east of the Outer Court are the halls of Military Eminence (H) and Literary Glory (J). The former was used at various times for the Emperor to receive ministers and hold court, and later housed the Palace's own printing house. The latter was used for ceremonial lectures by highly regarded Confucian scholars, and later became the office of the Grand Secretariat. A copy of the ''[[Siku Quanshu]]'' was stored there. To the north-east are the Southern Three Places ({{linktext|南|三|所}}) (K), which was the residence of the Crown Prince.&lt;ref name="Yu 49"&gt;p. 49, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inner Court or the Northern Section ===
The Inner Court is separated from the Outer Court by an oblong courtyard lying [[orthogonal]] to the City's main axis. It was the home of the Emperor and his family. In the Qing dynasty, the Emperor lived and worked almost exclusively in the Inner Court, with the Outer Court used only for ceremonial purposes.&lt;ref name="Yu 73"&gt;p. 73, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Back Three Palaces ====
At the centre of the Inner Court is another set of three halls (L). From the south, these are:
* [[Palace of Heavenly Purity]] ({{linktext|乾|清|宮}})
* [[Hall of Union]]
* [[Palace of Earthly Tranquility]]
Smaller than the Outer Court halls, the three halls of the Inner Court were the official residences of the Emperor and the Empress. The Emperor, representing [[Yin and Yang|Yang]] and the Heavens, would occupy the Palace of Heavenly Purity. The Empress, representing [[Yin and Yang|Yin]] and the Earth, would occupy the Palace of Earthly Tranquility. In between them was the Hall of Union, where the [[Yin and Yang]] mixed to produce harmony.&lt;ref name="Yu 75"&gt;p. 75, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Transmongolie-676 (27131815114).jpg|thumb|The throne in the [[Palace of Heavenly Purity]]]]
[[File:Neun-Drachen-Mauer.jpg|thumb|The Nine Dragons Screen in front of the [[Palace of Tranquil Longevity]]]]
[[File:故宫御花园 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The Imperial Garden]]

The [[Palace of Heavenly Purity]] is a double-eaved building, and set on a single-level white marble platform. It is connected to the [[Gate of Heavenly Purity]] to its south by a raised walkway. In the Ming dynasty, it was the residence of the Emperor. However, beginning from the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]], the Emperor lived instead at the smaller [[Hall of Mental Cultivation]] (N) to the west, out of respect to the memory of the [[Kangxi Emperor]].&lt;ref name="CCTV2" /&gt; The Palace of Heavenly Purity then became the Emperor's audience hall.&lt;ref name="Yu 78"&gt;p. 78, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; A caisson is set into the roof, featuring a coiled dragon. Above the throne hangs a tablet reading "Justice and Honour" ({{zh|c={{linktext|正|大|光|明}}|p=zhèngdàguāngmíng}}).&lt;ref&gt;p. 51, Yang (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Palace of Earthly Tranquility]] ({{linktext|坤|寧|宮}}) is a double-eaved building, 9 bays wide and 3 bays deep. In the Ming dynasty, it was the residence of the Empress. In the Qing dynasty, large portions of the Palace were converted for Shamanist worship by the new Manchu rulers. From the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor, the Empress moved out of the Palace. However, two rooms in the Palace of Earthly Harmony were retained for use on the Emperor's wedding night.&lt;ref name="Yu 80-83"&gt;pp. 80–83, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Between these two palaces is the [[Hall of Union]], which is square in shape with a pyramidal roof. Stored here are the 25 Imperial [[Chinese seal|Seals]] of the Qing dynasty, as well as other ceremonial items.&lt;ref name="CCTV3" /&gt;

Behind these three halls lies the Imperial Garden (M). Relatively small, and compact in design, the garden nevertheless contains several elaborate landscaping features.&lt;ref name="Yu 121"&gt;p. 121, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; To the north of the garden is the Gate of Divine Might.

Directly to the west is the [[Hall of Mental Cultivation]] (N). Originally a minor palace, this became the ''de facto'' residence and office of the Emperor starting from Yongzheng. In the last decades of the Qing dynasty, empresses dowager, including Cixi, held court from the eastern partition of the hall. Located around the Hall of Mental Cultivation are the offices of the [[Grand Council (Qing dynasty)|Grand Council]] and other key government bodies.&lt;ref name="Yu 87"&gt;p. 87, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

The north-eastern section of the Inner Court is taken up by the Palace of Tranquil Longevity ({{linktext|寧|壽|宮}}) (O), a complex built by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] in anticipation of his retirement. It mirrors the set-up of the Forbidden City proper and features an "outer court", an "inner court", and gardens and temples. The entrance to the Palace of Tranquil Longevity is marked by a glazed-tile [[Nine Dragons Screen]].&lt;ref name="Yu 115"&gt;p. 115, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; This section of the Forbidden City is being restored in a partnership between the Palace Museum and the [[World Monuments Fund]], a long-term project expected to finish in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_article/pg_12-17_qianlong_layout.pdf |title=Restoring an Intimate Splendor |author=Powell, Eric |publisher=[[World Monuments Fund]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516181709/https://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_article/pg_12-17_qianlong_layout.pdf |archivedate=16 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Western Six Palaces ====
* Palace of Eternal Longevity (永寿宫)
* Hall of the Supreme Principle (太极殿)
* Palace of Eternal Spring (长春宫)
* Palace of Earthly Honour (翊坤宫)
* Palace of Gathering Elegance (储秀宫)
* Palace of Universal Happiness (咸福宫)

=== Religion ===

[[File:故宫乾清门椽子万寿彩画.JPG|thumb|[[Swastika]] and [[Shou (character)|Longevity]] pattern. Similar designs can be found throughout the Imperial City.]]

Religion was an important part of life for the imperial court. In the Qing dynasty, the Palace of Earthly Harmony became a place of Manchu [[Shamanism|Shamanist]] ceremony. At the same time, the native Chinese [[Taoism|Taoist]] religion continued to have an important role throughout the Ming and Qing dynasties. There were two Taoist shrines, one in the imperial garden and another in the central area of the Inner Court.&lt;ref name="Yu 176"&gt;p. 176, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prevalent form of religion in the Qing dynasty palace was [[Buddhism]]. A number of temples and shrines were scattered throughout the Inner Court, including that of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] or Lamaism. Buddhist iconography also proliferated in the interior decorations of many buildings.&lt;ref name="Yu 177"&gt;p. 177, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, the Pavilion of the Rain of Flowers is one of the most important. It housed a large number of Buddhist statues, icons, and [[mandala]]s, placed in ritualistic arrangements.&lt;ref name="Yu 189-193"&gt;pp. 189–193, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surroundings ===
{{See also|Imperial City (Beijing)}}

[[File:Beijing city wall map vectorized.svg|thumb|left|Location of the Forbidden City in the historic centre of Beijing]]

The Forbidden City is surrounded on three sides by imperial gardens. To the north is [[Jingshan Park]], also known as Prospect Hill, an artificial hill created from the soil excavated to build the moat and from nearby lakes.&lt;ref name="Yu 20"&gt;p. 20, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

To the west lies [[Zhongnanhai]], a former royal garden centred on two connected lakes, which now serves as the central headquarters for the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]]. To the north-west lies [[Beihai Park]], also centred on a lake connected to the southern two, and a popular royal park.

To the south of the Forbidden City were two important shrines – the Imperial Shrine of Family or the [[Imperial Ancestral Temple]]  ({{zh|c={{linktext|太|廟}}|p=Tàimiào}}) and the Imperial Shrine of State or [[Beijing Shejitan]] ({{zh|c={{linktext|社|稷|壇|}}|p=Shèjìtán}}), where the Emperor would venerate the spirits of his ancestors and the spirit of the nation, respectively. Today, these are the Beijing Labouring People's Cultural Hall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.china.org.cn/english/features/beijing/31019.htm|title=Working People's Cultural Palace|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=China.org.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zhongshan Park (Beijing)|Zhongshan Park]] (commemorating [[Sun Yat-sen]]) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.china.org.cn/english/features/beijing/31020.htm|title=Zhongshan Park
|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=China.org.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the south, two nearly identical gatehouses stand along the main axis. They are the [[Duanmen|Upright Gate]] ({{zh|c={{linktext|端|门}}|p=Duānmén}}) and the more famous [[Tiananmen Gate]], which is decorated with a portrait of [[Mao Zedong]] in the centre and two placards to the left and right: "Long Live the People's Republic of China" and "Long live the Great Unity of the World's Peoples". The Tiananmen Gate connects the Forbidden City precinct with the modern, symbolic centre of the Chinese state, Tiananmen Square.

While development is now tightly controlled in the vicinity of the Forbidden City, throughout the past century uncontrolled and sometimes politically motivated demolition and reconstruction has changed the character of the areas surrounding the Forbidden City. Since 2000, the Beijing municipal government has worked to evict governmental and military institutions occupying some historical buildings, and has established a park around the remaining parts of the Imperial City wall. In 2004, an ordinance relating to building height and planning restriction was renewed to establish the Imperial City area and the northern city area as a buffer zone for the Forbidden City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forbidden City Buffer Zone Plan submitted to World Heritage conference|url=https://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2005-07/16/content_3225720.htm|publisher=Xinhua Net|date=2005-07-16|accessdate=2007-04-13|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207165716/https://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2005-07/16/content_3225720.htm|archivedate=7 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Imperial City and [[Beihai Park|Beihai]] (as an extension item to the [[Summer Palace]]) were included in the shortlist for the next [[World Heritage Site]] in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Yang|last=Li|title=Beijing confirms 7 World Heritage alternate items; Large scale reconstruction of Imperial City halted|url=https://www.bj.xinhuanet.com/bjpd_sdzx/2005-06/04/content_4374144.htm|publisher=Xinhua Net|date=2005-06-04|accessdate=2007-04-13|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206151702/https://www.bj.xinhuanet.com/bjpd_sdzx/2005-06/04/content_4374144.htm|archivedate=6 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the Forbidden City, from its overall layout to the smallest detail, was meticulously planned to reflect [[Chinese philosophy|philosophical]] and [[Religion in China|religious]] principles, and above all to symbolise the majesty of Imperial power. Some noted examples of symbolic designs include:
* Yellow is the color of the Emperor. Thus almost all roofs in the Forbidden City bear yellow glazed tiles. There are only two exceptions. The library at the Pavilion of Literary Profundity ({{linktext|文|渊|阁}}) had black tiles because black was associated with [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|water]], and thus fire-prevention. Similarly, the Crown Prince's residences have green tiles because green was associated with [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|wood]], and thus growth.&lt;ref name="DPM Elements" /&gt;
* The main halls of the Outer and Inner courts are all arranged in groups of three – the shape of the [[Bagua (concept)|Qian]] triagram, representing Heaven. The residences of the Inner Court on the other hand are arranged in groups of six – the shape of the [[Bagua (concept)|Kun]] triagram, representing the Earth.&lt;ref name="CCTV2" /&gt;
* The sloping ridges of building roofs are decorated with a [[Imperial roof decoration|line of statuettes]] led by a man riding a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] and followed by an [[Chinese dragon|imperial dragon]]. The number of statuettes represents the status of the building – a minor building might have 3 or 5. The Hall of Supreme Harmony has 10, the only building in the country to be permitted this in Imperial times. As a result, its 10th statuette, called a "''Hangshi''", or "ranked tenth" ({{zh|c={{linktext|行|十}}|p=Hángshí}}),&lt;ref name="CCTV3"&gt;{{cite video|people=China Central Television, The Palace Museum|date=2005|url=https://www.cctv.com/history/special/C15041/01/index.shtml|title=Gugong: "III.

* The layout of buildings follows ancient customs laid down in the ''[[Classic of Rites]]''. Thus, ancestral temples are in front of the palace. Storage areas are placed in the front part of the palace complex, and residences in the back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steinhardt|first=Nancy Shatzman|date=Dec 1986|title=Why were Chang'an and Beijing so different?|journal=The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|volume=45|issue=4|pages=339–357|doi=10.2307/990206|jstor=990206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collections of the Palace Museum are based on the Qing imperial collection. According to the results of a 1925 audit, some 1.17&amp;nbsp;million pieces of art were stored in the Forbidden City.&lt;ref name=Wen&gt;{{cite book|last=Wen|first=Lianxi (ed.)|title=故宫物品点查报告 [Palace items auditing report]|year=1925|publisher=Caretaker Committee of the Qing dynasty Imperial Family. Reprint (2004): Xianzhuang Book Company|location=Beijing|isbn=7-80106-238-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the imperial libraries housed a large collection of rare books and historical documents, including government documents of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The forbidden city: the biography of a palace|author=Dorn, Frank|place=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]]|year=1970|oclc=101030|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1933, the threat of Japanese invasion forced the evacuation of the most important parts of the Museum's collection. After the end of World War II, this collection was returned to Nanjing. However, with the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]]' victory imminent in the Chinese Civil War, the Nationalist government decided to ship the pick of this collection to Taiwan. Of the 13,491 boxes of evacuated artefacts, 2,972 boxes are now housed in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. More than 8,000 boxes were returned to Beijing, but 2,221 boxes remain today in storage under the charge of the [[Nanjing Museum]].&lt;ref name="Three" /&gt;

After 1949, the Museum conducted a new audit as well as a thorough search of the Forbidden City, uncovering a number of important items. In addition, the government moved items from other museums around the country to replenish the Palace Museum's collection. It also purchased and received donations from the public.&lt;ref name="Guangming"&gt;{{cite news|title=北京故宫与台北故宫 谁的文物藏品多？ (Beijing Palace Museum and Taipei Palace Museum: which collection is bigger?)|url=https://news.xinhuanet.com/collection/2005-01/16/content_2467212.htm|work=Guangming Daily|publisher=Xinhua Net|date=2005-01-16|accessdate=2007-07-05|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110202014/https://news.xinhuanet.com/collection/2005-01/16/content_2467212.htm|archivedate=10 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there are over a million rare and valuable works of art in the permanent collection of the Palace Museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://architecture.about.com/od/asiasouthasia/ig/Ancient-Beijing/Forbidden-City.htm|title=Forbidden City in Beijing, China|publisher=[[About.com]]: Architecture|author=[[Jackie Craven]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; including paintings, ceramics, seals, steles, sculptures, inscribed wares, bronze wares, enamel objects, etc. A new inventory of the Museum's collections was conducted between 2004 and 2010. Subsequently, the Palace Museum was shown to hold a total of 1,807,558 artefacts and includes 1,684,490 items designated as nationally protected "valuable cultural relics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-01/27/c_13709525.htm|title=Palace Museum puts its house in order|work=China Daily|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|date=2011-01-27|accessdate=2011-01-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131083859/https://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-01/27/c_13709525.htm|archivedate=31 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2016, the Palace Museum held a press conference, announcing that 55,132 previously unlisted items had been discovered in an inventory check carried out from 2014 to 2016. The total number of items in the Palace Museum collection is presently at 1,862,690 objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://english.sina.com/culture/her/2017-04-06/detail-ifyeceza1283236.shtml|title=Palace Museum discovers 55,000 items hidden within the Forbidden City – Life &amp; Culture News – SINA English|website=english.sina.com|access-date=2017-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Ceramics

The Palace Museum holds 340,000 pieces of [[ceramic]]s and [[porcelain]]. These include imperial collections from the [[Tang dynasty]] and the [[Song dynasty]], as well as pieces commissioned by the Palace, and, sometimes, by the Emperor personally. The Palace Museum holds about 320,000 pieces of porcelain from the imperial collection. The rest are almost all held in the National Palace Museum in Taipei and the Nanjing Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dpm.org.cn/ |title=Collection highlights – Ceramics |accessdate=2007-07-05 |author=The Palace Museum |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701213540/https://www.dpm.org.cn/ |archivedate=1 July 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Painting
The Palace Museum holds close to 50,000 paintings. Of these, more than 400 date from before the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368). This is the largest such collection in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dpm.org.cn/ |title=Collection highlights – Paintings |accessdate=2007-07-05 |author=The Palace Museum |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701213540/https://www.dpm.org.cn/ |archivedate=1 July 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection is based on the palace collection in the Ming and Qing dynasties. The personal interest of Emperors such as Qianlong meant that the palace held one of the most important collections of paintings in Chinese history. However, a significant portion of this collection was lost over the years. After his abdication, Puyi transferred paintings out of the palace, and many of these were subsequently lost or destroyed. In 1948, many of the works were moved to Taiwan. The collection has subsequently been replenished, through donations, purchases, and transfers from other museums.

;Bronzeware
The Palace Museum's [[bronze]] collection dates from the early [[Shang dynasty]]. Of the almost 10,000 pieces held, about 1,600 are inscribed items from the pre-[[Qin dynasty|Qin]] period (to 221 BC). A significant part of the collection is ceremonial bronzeware from the imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dpm.org.cn/ |title=Collection highlights – Bronzeware |accessdate=2007-07-05 |author=The Palace Museum |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701213540/https://www.dpm.org.cn/ |archivedate=1 July 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Timepieces
The Palace Museum has one of the largest collections of mechanical timepieces of the 18th and 19th centuries in the world, with more than 1,000 pieces. The collection contains both Chinese- and foreign-made pieces. Chinese pieces came from the palace's own workshops, [[Guangzhou]] (Canton) and [[Suzhou]] (Suchow). Foreign pieces came from countries including [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], France, Switzerland, the United States and Japan. Of these, the largest portion come from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dpm.org.cn/ |title=Collection highlights – Timepieces |accessdate=2007-07-05 |author=The Palace Museum |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701213540/https://www.dpm.org.cn/ |archivedate=1 July 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jade]] has a unique place in [[Chinese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laufer|first=Berthold|title=Jade: A Study in Chinese Archeology &amp; Religion|year=1912|publisher=Reprint (1989): Peter Smith Pub Inc|location=Gloucestor MA|isbn=978-0-8446-5214-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum's collection, mostly derived from the imperial collection, includes some 30,000 pieces. The pre-Yuan dynasty part of the collection includes several pieces famed throughout history, as well as artefacts from more recent archaeological discoveries. The earliest pieces date from the [[Neolithic]] period. Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty pieces, on the other hand, include both items for palace use, as well as tribute items from around the Empire and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dpm.org.cn/ |title=Collection highlights – Jade |accessdate=2007-07-05 |author=The Palace Museum |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701213540/https://www.dpm.org.cn/ |archivedate=1 July 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Palace artefacts
In addition to works of art, a large proportion of the Museum's collection consists of the artefacts of the imperial court. This includes items used by the imperial family and the palace in daily life, as well as various ceremonial and bureaucratic items important to government administration. This comprehensive collection preserves the daily life and ceremonial protocols of the imperial era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dpm.org.cn/ |title=Collection highlights – Palace artefacts |accessdate=2007-07-05 |author=The Palace Museum |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701213540/https://www.dpm.org.cn/ |archivedate=1 July 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forbidden City, the culmination of the two-thousand-year development of classical Chinese and East Asian architecture, has been influential in the subsequent development of [[Chinese architecture]], as well as providing inspiration for many artistic works. Some specific examples include:

;Depiction in art, film, literature and popular culture
The Forbidden City has served as the scene to many works of fiction. In recent years, it has been depicted in films and television series. Some notable examples include:
* ''[[The Forbidden City]]'' (1918), a fiction film about a Chinese emperor and an American.
* ''[[The Last Emperor]]'' (1987), a [[biopic|biographical film]] about [[Puyi]], was the first feature film ever authorised by the government of the People's Republic of China to be filmed in the Forbidden City.
* ''[[Forbidden City Cop]]'' (1996) a Hong Kong wuxia comedy film about an imperial secret agent
* ''[[Marco Polo (mini-series)|Marco Polo]]'' a joint [[NBC]] and [[RAI]] [[Miniseries|TV miniseries]] broadcast in the early 1980s, was filmed inside the Forbidden City. Note, however, that the present Forbidden City did not exist in the [[Yuan dynasty]], when [[Marco Polo]] met [[Kublai Khan]].
* The 2003 real-time strategy game ''[[Rise of Nations]]'' depicts the Forbidden City as one of the great wonders of the world; in terms of game mechanics, it functions identically to a major city and provides additional resources to the player.

;Live Performance concert venue
The Forbidden City has also served as a performance venue. However, its use for this purpose is strictly limited, due to the heavy impact of equipment and performance on the ancient structures. Almost all performances said to be "in the Forbidden City" are held outside the palace walls.
* In 1997, Greek-born composer and keyboardist [[Yanni]] performed a live concert in front of the Forbidden City the first modern Western artist to perform at the historic Chinese site. The concert was recorded and later released as part of the ''[[Tribute]]'' album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yanni.com/bio/ |title=Biography |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814074140/https://yanni.com/bio/ |archivedate=14 August 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s opera, ''[[Turandot]]'', the story of a Chinese princess, was performed at the Imperial Shrine just outside the Forbidden City for the first time in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.turandotonsite.com/|title=Turandot at the Forbidden City, Beijing 1998|accessdate=2007-05-01}}; note some inconsistency in the description of the venue on the official site: it [https://www.turandotonsite.com/Current/Event/ForbiddenCity.html claims] that the venue, the People's Cultural Palace, was the "[[Palace of Heavenly Purity|Hall of Heavenly Purity]]". In fact, the Working People's Cultural Palace was the Temple to the Emperor's Ancestors= [https://www.china.org.cn/english/features/beijing/31019.htm China.org: Working People's Cultural Palace].&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2001, the [[Three Tenors]], [[Plácido Domingo]] and [[José Carreras]] and [[Luciano Pavarotti]], sang in front of Forbidden City main gate as one of their performances.
* In 2004, the French musician [[Jean Michel Jarre]] performed a live concert in front of the Forbidden City, accompanied by 260 musicians, as part of the "Year of France in China" festivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3733290.stm

[[File:The History of an Art.jpg|thumb|400px|Collection of incandescent electric lamps by William Joseph Hammer]]

The '''Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps''' (titled "The History of an Art") was an exhibit of early electric [[light bulb]]s and was collected by [[William Joseph Hammer]]. The collection of lamp bulbs is the most comprehensive known in the world.{{sfn|Edisonia|1904|p=87}} It shows the technology development of the filament electric light bulb during [[Thomas Edison]]'s lifetime. Hammer's collection was displayed for years in five glass cases at the Headquarters of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in [[New York City]]. It is now housed at [[The Henry Ford|The Henry Ford Museum]] in Dearborn, Michigan. 

== Description ==
[[File:William Joseph Hammer in 1881.jpg|thumb|right|William Joseph Hammer in 1881]]
William Joseph Hammer started to collect [[incandescent light bulb]]s from 1879 while they were being developed in the [[Thomas Edison#Menlo Park|Edison laboratory]] in [[Menlo Park, New Jersey]].{{sfn|Technical_Literature|1907|p=1}} He was an associate of [[Thomas Edison]] and in his engineering career he was able to collect early filament electric light bulbs from Edison and others because of his association in the field.{{sfn|Electrical_Age|1896|p=232}} The Hammer collection is the most comprehensive collection of incandescent electric light bulbs known in the world.{{sfn|Edisonia|1904|p=87}}&lt;ref name=Smith_NMAH.AC.0069&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sova.si.edu/record/NMAH.AC.0069?q=William+J.+Hammer+Collection+&amp;s=0&amp;n=10&amp;i=1 |title=William J.

Hammer's incandescent light bulb collection from around the world was titled "The History of an Art"{{sfn|Edisonia|1904|p=87}} and he exhibited it at various times in electrical expositions and shows.{{sfn|Electrical_Age|1896|p=232}} He first exhibited it in 1882 at the International Electrical Exposition at the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] in London and was awarded a silver medal for the presentation.{{sfn|Edison_Monthly|1921|p=68}} When he presented his collection at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|St. Louis World's Fair of 1904]] he was awarded the Grand Prize.{{sfn|Edisonia|1904|p=87-116}}{{sfn|White|1916|p=219}}

Hammer was awarded the [[Elliott Cresson Gold Medal]] from the [[Franklin Institute]] for his collection in 1906.{{sfn|White|1916|p=219}} The General Electric Company bought the collection from Hammer in 1912 for $10,000.&lt;ref name=Knew_Best&gt;

The display information for each Case is how it existed in 1913 after Hammer had collected these light bulbs for 34 years.{{r|Covington}} In 1931 the light bulb collection had an estimated value of over a million dollars.&lt;ref name=enthusiasm&gt;

The incandescent lamp collection of over a thousand antique electric light bulbs was displayed formally
for over ten years starting in 1913 at the Headquarters of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in New York City. It was arranged in five glass cases at the end of a room in a large [[horseshoe]] shape. Two of the cases were on the back wall with one case each on the adjacent side walls. These cases each were ten feet in length. The cases were made of French plate clear glass and had glass shelves.{{sfn|Edisonia|1904|p=89}}  They had mirrors at the back to show the back side of the bulbs. In addition to these there was a fifth case in the center, which was four feet square. The cases were numbered 1 to 5 and displayed each a period of the evolution of the incandescent electric light bulb development. They showed on a label the country of origin, date, and inventor of each.&lt;ref name=Covington&gt;{{cite web |url= http://home.frognet.net/~ejcov/hammer.html |title=The William J.

Ballinger |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4981192// |newspaper=The Rhinelander Daily News |location=Rhinelander, Wisconsin |date=October 28, 1931 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other electric lamps made by others had inherent defects and burned out quickly, making them not practical for use to the general public. Edison first used various experimental vegetable fibers for the lamp filaments. One was a processed [[bamboo]] fiber used for a filament inside a glass bulb containing a vacuum. This was a filament of high resistance. Edison's electric lamp internal wire was unique in that the element had a resistance of around 140 ohms. There were several advantages to this, one being that several could be connected at the same time to a circuit. Others used filaments of low resistance ranging from 1 ohm to 5 ohms. This low resistance not only overloaded the electrical power system, but the wire filaments burned out quickly from extreme heat. They were impractical and expensive – not conducive to a commercial market.&lt;ref name=reprint/&gt;

[[File:Hammer case No 1.jpg|thumb|Case No. 1 illustrated mostly early versions of Edison electric light bulbs]]

=== Case 1 ===

Case No. 1 contained a selection of lamps that represented the basics of the technology involved in the early stages of the electric light bulb development. The case displayed actual physical light bulbs made by [[Thomas Edison]] and others from 1878 to 1883. Edison's earliest steps in the bamboo filament and graphite filament lamps are displayed in this case. The first lamp made in a pear shape was in this display, which was the universal shape for electric light bulbs for decades. These in this display case contained numbers that ranged from 1 – 109.&lt;ref name=reprint/&gt;&lt;ref name=Covington/&gt;

=== Case 2 ===
[[File:Hammer case No 2.jpg|thumb|left|No. 2 of mostly other inventors' lamps]]
Case No. 2 contained lamps that showed the various stages of the development of the carbon filament lamp from 1878 to 1913. It supplemented Case #1 and showed date order of the technology. In this case were "stopper lamps" which Mr. Edison made as early as 1880. These lamps were originally numbered 110 to 357. The "stopper lamps" were made by others like Westinghouse, Packard, and Greene. This type of electric light bulb had the filament stem built into the neck of the glass bulb. This was purposefully designed this way to circumvent the Edison patents. Many of these lamps were used by the [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] for lights at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|World's Fair of Chicago]] in 1893.  They represented the state of the art in incandescent electric lights from others that worked closely with Edison to advance this technology.&lt;ref name=reprint/&gt;&lt;ref name=Covington/&gt;{{sfn|New York Electrical Society|1912|p=22}}

There were over 300 bulbs grouped in date sections in this case by such innovators as Alexander Bernstein, Charles de Changy, [[William Crookes]], [[Alessandro Cruto]], [[Hiram Stevens Maxim]], [[St. George Lane Fox-Pitt]], [[Alexander Lodygin]], [[William E. Sawyer]], Müller, William H. Akester, Henry E. Nothomb, L. H. Rogers, [[Joseph Swan]], [[James Swinburne]], [[Werner von Siemens]], Ludwig K. Boehm, Greinert-Friederich, and [[Lewis Howard Latimer]].{{sfn|Edisonia|1904|p=89}} {{sfn|New York Electrical Society|1912|p=29}}

=== Case 3 ===

This Case further represented the development of the incandescent electric light bulb from the fundamental steps shown in Case #1. These electric lamps were from worldwide inventors that worked directly with Edison on ideas. The electric light bulbs were grouped chronologically from 1881 to 1904. Among these were some Diehl's induction lamps for use with alternating current. A description of how this technology worked is that of a secondary coil of wire was placed inside the bulb of a vacuum. The two ends of the coiled wire connected to the filament that was electrified and provided the light. A primary coil was wound on the outside of the glass bulb. This coil was connected to an alternating current electrical power supply. The secondary coil inside the bulb would receive this alternating magnetism from the primary coil and provide an electrical current that electrified the inside filament. Ultimately this type of alternating current technology never developed and was not used. Pictures of some of the lamps that were in this display are below. These were later numbered 358 to 536.&lt;ref name=reprint/&gt;&lt;ref name=Covington/&gt;{{sfn|New York Electrical Society|1912|p=22}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Case 4 ===
Case No. 4 further represented the development of the incandescent electric light bulb from the fundamental steps shown in Case No. 1 and Case No. 3. These lamps showed a time period of from 1893 to 1903 and included special regulating lamps, styles for advertising signs, and novelty lamps like those made for Christmas trees.&lt;ref name=reprint/&gt;&lt;ref name=Covington/&gt;

This case had a lamp and socket used by Hammer for the first electric sign ever made. It lit up the name EDISON letter by letter in sequence when a set of switches were turned on by hand – one at a time in order. It was constructed in December 1881 and hung up in 1882 at [[the Crystal Palace]] in London. The lamp bulbs in this case display were numbered 782 to 1031. Below are some of the incandescent electric lamps that were in this case.&lt;ref name=reprint/&gt;&lt;ref name=Covington/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Case 5 ===
[[File:Case 5.jpg|thumb|Display Case 5]]
Case No. 5 were light bulbs that represented the state of the art of filament lamps from 1900 to 1913. They show electric lights using certain gases within the sealed bulb. They were directing a path of technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock in the center and a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited [[Pierre Curie]], the husband of [[Madam Curie]]. Professor Curie drew a diagram on the blackboard and suggested that Hammer make a lamp like that with sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained to Hammer what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate [[luminescence]] that would produce light without a hot filament involved.&lt;ref name=reprint/&gt;&lt;ref name=Covington/&gt;

Lamps in this case also show how some of these [[vacuum tube#History and development|experimental bulbs]] progressed into vacuum tubes that were used in radios and TVs. Below are some of the incandescent electric lamps that were in this display case. These were numbered 530 to 871.&lt;ref name=reprint/&gt;&lt;ref name=Covington/&gt;

== History ==
Founded in October 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/iprice#/entity|title=iPrice {{!}} CrunchBase|website=www.crunchbase.com|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, iprice expanded in the same year it was founded&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.prnasia.com/story/122322-0.shtml|title=Southeast Asia's "One Stop Shopping Destination" iprice group Receives Seed Funding Worth US$550K from Asia Venture Group-PR Newswire Asia-Newswire|website=en.prnasia.com|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became an active player in the e-commerce industry of six other countries: Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lowyat.net/2015/84987/iprice-aims-to-be-the-one-stop-shopping-destination-for-e-commerce-shoppers/|title=iprice Aims to be the One-Stop Shopping Destination for e-Commerce Shoppers|website=Lowyat.NET|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site first started out as a [[Coupon sites|coupon site]] that offers deals and discounts for other online stores, but later changed into a shopping aggregator that helps shoppers compare prices from various e-commerce sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.prnasia.com/story/122322-0.shtml|title=Southeast Asia's "One Stop Shopping Destination" iprice group Receives Seed Funding Worth US$550K from Asia Venture Group-PR Newswire Asia-Newswire|website=en.prnasia.com|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service ==
iprice provides the service of hosting products from several [[E-commerce in Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian e-commerce sites]] on one platform. With claims that it is more than just a price-comparison site as it focuses more on the discovery of products rather than the price of the products,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/20/iprice/|title=iPrice, A One Stop Shop For Buying Online In Southeast Asia, Lands $550,000|last=Russell|first=Jon|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; how the site works is that it narrows down the vast volume of products (via a search and filter interface) to find products that would suit the consumer’s preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techinasia.com/iprice-ecommerce-aggregator-funding|title=Tech in Asia - Connecting Asia's startup ecosystem|website=www.techinasia.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from being a platform for several e-commerce sites, iprice is also considered as a [[comparison shopping website]].

== Funding ==
iprice raised its first round of seed funding in May 2015. It received approximately US$550,000 from [[Asia Venture Group]] (AVG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techinasia.com/iprice-ecommerce-aggregator-funding|title=Tech in Asia - Connecting Asia's startup ecosystem|website=www.techinasia.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second round of seed funding came in December 2015 when the aggregator announced that it had raised US$1.2 million. This round was led by existing investor, AVG, followed by [[500 Startups]], IMJ Investment Partners, Venturra Capital, F2 Capital, and Starstrike Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techinasia.com/ecommerce-iprice-gets-funding-boost-to-focus-on-mobile|title=Tech in Asia - Connecting Asia's startup ecosystem|website=www.techinasia.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2016, iprice closed a $4 million Series A funding round led by Asia Venture Group (AVG) and Venturra.

== Partnerships ==
iprice is a partner of several online sites to provide potential customers with the chance of accessing its money-saving deals and bargains (or more commonly known as coupons).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/116780-iprice-rappler-coupons|title=iprice group forges exclusive coupon serving partnership with Rappler|website=Rappler|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/sg-startup-dealbook-iprice-in-exclusive-partnership-with-rev-asia-purplestream-in-jv-with-macau-asia-network-18338/|title=iprice in exclusive partnership with REV Asia|website=DealStreetAsia|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its coupons cover a wide range of discounts and offers available for various e-commerce sites, such as Zalora, Lazada, [[Uber (company)|Uber,]] and [[Foodpanda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.my/iprice-group-rev-asia-forge-exclusive-coupon-serving-partnership/#pBb8vGKYfUmk0THd.97|title=iprice Group and REV Asia Forge Exclusive Coupon Serving Partnership - Business Insider|website=Business Insider|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the partners currently signed up under this coupon program are [http://coupons.rappler.com/ Rappler] (for Philippines)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/116780-iprice-rappler-coupons|title=iprice group forges exclusive coupon serving partnership with Rappler|website=Rappler|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as two of REV Asia’s Malaysia-based news sites; [[Says Sdn Bhd|SAYS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://coupon.says.com/|title=Discount Codes, Coupons &amp; Promos {{!}} coupon.says.com|website=coupon.says.com|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft''''' was a weekly magazine by Aerospace Publishing/[[Orbis Publishing]] that was published in the [[UK]] (and sold in other countries too) in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=aerof/&gt; The magazine was intended to eventually make up a multi-volume encyclopedia dedicated to aviation. Starting in 1982 the magazine lasted for 216 issues, each of 20 pages (plus the cover), making up 18 volumes (4280 pages).&lt;ref name=aerof&gt;{{cite web|title=Aviation Magazines in United Kingdom – Partworks|url=http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/mags/special-listing/aviation-magazines-in-united-kingdom-partworks.htm|publisher=Aeroflight|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two issues were sold together for the price of one, subsequent issues were sold on their own.

Empty binders for each volume (set of 12 issues) were also sold. These binders were dark blue in colour and contained the imprint of a [[Panavia Tornado]] on the front. They held the issues using a metal strip that was threaded through the staples of each issue to hold them in place. Each issue consisted of four separate sections.

The final two issues (215 and 216) gave the index for the encyclopedia. A contents was also given with these final issues that was intended to be put into the start of volume 1. The magazine ceased publication in 1985.&lt;ref name=aerof/&gt;

==History of Aviation==
The first few pages of each issue (usually 4 or 5) were dedicated to the [[history of aviation]] which also covered [[commercial aviation]] and current (as in early 1980s) air power ("Air Power Today").

The "History of Aviation" began in issue 1 with a 7 part series on the [[Vietnam War]]. Most of the "History of Aviation" was taken up with warfare especially [[World War II]] starting with the [[Blitzkrieg]] in issue 8 and ending with [[defeat of Japan]] in issue 156. The coverage of World War 2 also included surveys of different combat roles and aircraft types.

[[World War I]] was also covered as was the [[Korean War]], [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Post-World War II air-to-air combat losses|post-World War II colonial conflicts]] and the [[Arab-Israeli Conflict|Arab-Israeli Wars]]. In later issues the [[Cold War]] was covered in depth.

"Air Power Today" covered the then current (1980s) military situation with surveys of different types of military aircraft and combat roles and regional surveys of airpower around the world.

The history of "Commercial Aviation" was also covered in a multi-part series starting with the earliest commercial air flights and ending with [[general aviation]] and [[microlights]] near the very end of the Encyclopedia's run.

==The World's Greatest Aircraft==
The second section of the issue was "The World's Greatest Aircraft" and was an in depth look at a major aircraft type, including a cutaway drawing, a list of variants and a three-way view in colour on the centre pages. The [[North American Mustang]] was featured in issue one, with the [[North American XB-70]] the final aircraft featured in issue 214.

==A-Z of Aircraft==
The third section was the "A-Z of Aircraft" which started off in great depth though in later issues stopped featuring more obscure types and collected minor aircraft manufacturer's aircraft into one entry. This can be illustrated by the first and last entries in the A-Z. The first aircraft featured was the [[AAMSA A9B-M Quail]] (on page 14) but the last (on page 3120) was a collected entry on the aircraft of [[Zmaj (Fabrika Aeroplaná I Hidoplaná Zmaj)]]. However based on the Zmaj entry then the last aircraft in the A-Z is the Zmaj Nebojsa.

When the A-Z was completed this section was replaced by the "Chronology of Aviation" from 1903 to 1984 and finally a history of [[Royal Air Force|RAF squadrons]].

==Back pages==
The final section (though it was part of the cover which was to be removed when the issue was placed in a binder) was a feature on an [[air force]] or [[airline]]. The back cover either featured an advert for the binders or a full page photo of an aircraft. Sometimes the airforce/airline feature was omitted in favour of an order form for binders or back issues or even sometimes an advert.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18262">The '''Information Coding Classification''' ('''ICC''') is a [[classification system]] covering almost all extant 6500 knowledge fields ([[knowledge domain]]s). Its [[conceptualization]] goes beyond the scope of the well known  library classification systems, such as [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DCC), [[Universal Decimal Classification]] (UDC), and [[Library of Congress Classification]] (LCC), by extending also to [[knowledge system]]s that so far have not afforded to  classify  [[literature]].  ICC actually presents a flexible universal ordering system for both literature and other kinds of [[information]], set out as knowledge fields. From a methodological point of view, ICC differs from the above-mentioned systems along the following three lines:
# Its main classes are not based on [[discipline]]s but on nine live stages of development, so-called [[ontic]]al levels.
# It breaks them roughly down into hierarchical steps by further nine [[Categorization|categories]] which makes decimal number coding possible.
# The contents of a knowledge field is earmarked via a digital position scheme, which makes the first hierarchical step refer to the nine ontical levels  (object areas as subject categories), and the second hierarchical step refer to nine functionally ordered form categories.
Respective knowledge fields permit to step down by the same principle to a third and  forth level, and even further to a fifth and sixth level. Finally, knowledge field subdivisions will have to conform to said digital position scheme.
Hence, for a given knowledge field identical codes will mark identical categories under respective numbers of the coding system. This  [[mnemotechnics|mnemotechnical]]  aspect of the  system helps memorizing and straightaway retrieving the whereabouts of respective [[interdisciplinary]] and [[transdisciplinary]] fields.

The first two hierarchical levels may be regarded as a top- or [[upper ontology]] for ontologies and other applications.

The terms of the first three hierarchical levels were set out in German and English in ''Wissensorganisation. Entwicklung, Aufgabe, Anwendung, Zukunft'',&lt;ref name="WEAAZ2014"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=[[Ingetraut Dahlberg]]|EditorSurname1=Deutsche Sektion der Internationalen Gesellschaft für Wissensorganisation e.V. (ISKO)|Periodical=Textbooks for Knowledge Organization|Title=Wissensorganisation. Entwicklung, Aufgabe, Anwendung, Zukunft |Volume=Vol.3|Publisher=Ergon Verlag|PublicationPlace=Würzburg|Year=2014|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;1-175|ISBN=978-3-95650-065-7|Date=  2014|language=German|AccessDate=2015-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; on pp.&amp;nbsp;82 to 100. It was published in 2014 and available so far only in German. In the meantime, also the French terms of the knowlwdge fields have been collected.
Competence for maintenance and further development rests with the German Chapter of the  
[[International Society for Knowledge Organization]] (ISKO) e.V.

== Historical development ==
At the end of 1970, Prof. Alwin Diemer, Univ.of Düsseldorf proposed to [[Ingetraut Dahlberg]] to undertake a philosophical [[dissertation]] on ''The universal classification system of knowledge, its ontological, epistemological, and information theoretical foundations''. Diemer had in mind an innovating ontological approach for such a system based on the whole spectrum of kinds of being and complying with [[epistemological]] requirements. The third requirement had already been taken up somehow in the Indian [[Colon Classification]], yet it still called for explanations and additions. In 1974, the dissertation was published in German entitled ''Grundlagen universaler Wissensordnung''.&lt;ref name="GuWo"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|EditorSurname1=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Dokumentation e.V.|Title=Grundlagen universaler Wissensordnung. Probleme und Möglichkeiten eines universalen Klassifikationssystems des Wissens. : im Antiquariat noch erhältlich sonst als Print on Demand bei deGruyter|Publisher=Verlag Dokumentation|PublicationPlace=Pullach bei München|Year=1974|ISBN=978-3111412672|Date=  1974|language=German|AccessDate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It started with conceptual clarifications, and why and how the term „universal“ was linked to knowledge, including knowledge fields, such as commodity science, artefacts,  statistics, patents, standardization, communication, utility services et al. In chapter 3, six universal classification systems (DDC, UDC, LCC, BC, CC and BBK) were presented,  analyzed and compared.

While preparing the dissertation, Dahlberg started with elaborating the new universal system by first gleaning a lot of extant designations of knowledge fields from whatever available reference works. This was funded by the German Documentation Society (DGD) (1971-2) under the title of ''Order system of knowledge fields''. In addition, the [[syllabus]]es of German universities and polytechniques were explored for relevant terms and documented (1975).  Thereafter, it seemed necessary to add definitions from special dictionaries and encyclopediae; it soon appeared that the 12.500 terms included numerous synonyms, so that the whole collection boiled down to about 6.500 concept designations (Project Logstruktur, supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) 1976-78).

The outcome of this work &lt;ref name="GuWo" /&gt; was the formulation of 30 theses which ended up in 12 principles for the new system, published 40 years later under.&lt;ref name="WEAAZ2014" /&gt; These principles refer not only to theoretical foundations but also to structure and other organizational aspects of the whole array of knowledge fields. In 1974, the digital position scheme for field subdivision had already been developed  to allow for classifying classification literature in the bibliographical section of the first issue of the Journal International Classification. In 1977, the entire ICC  was ready for presentation at a seminar in Bangalore, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|EditorSurname1=Sarada Ranganathan Endowment for Library Science|Title=Ontical Structures and Universal Classification |PublicationPlace=Bangalore|Year=1978|Date=  1978|language=German|AccessDate=2014-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A publication of the first three hierarchical levels appeared however only in 1982.&lt;ref name="ICC-PSAP"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|Periodical=International Classification|Title=ICC – Information Coding Classification. Principles, structure and application possibilities |Volume=2|Year=1982|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;98-103|Date=  1982|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was applied to the bibliography of classification systems and [[thesauri]] in vol.1 of the International Classification and Indexing Bibliography;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|EditorSurname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|Title=International Classification and Indexing Bibliography (ICIB 1): Classification systems and thesauri 1950-1982 |Publisher=INDEKS Verlag|PublicationPlace=Frankfurt|Year=1982|ISSN=0943-7444|Date=  1982|language=German|AccessDate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been updated.&lt;ref name="WEAAZ2014" /&gt;

== Governing principles of ICC ==
These were published in full length in the book ''Wissensorganisation. Entwicklung, Aufgabe, Anwendung, Zukunft''&lt;ref name="WEAAZ2014" /&gt; and the  article ''Information Coding Classification. Geschichtliches, Prinzipien, Inhaltliches'',&lt;ref name="ICC2010"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|EditorSurname1=Marlies Ockenfeld|Periodical=Information, Wissenschaft &amp; Praxis|Title=Information Coding Classification. Geschichtliches, Prinzipien, Inhaltliches |Volume=61, Heft 8|Publisher=De Gruyter|Year=2010|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;449-454|ISSN=1619-4292|Date=  2010|language=German|AccessDate=2015-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence it suffices to just mention their topics with some necessary additions.

* Principle 1: Concept theoretical approaches. Concepts are the contents of ICC, they are understood as being units of knowledge. The „birth“ of a concept. Where do the characteristics, the knowledge elements come from? How do conceptual relations arise?
* Principle 2: The four kinds of concept relations and their applications.
* Principle 3: Decimal numbers form the ICC codes as its universal language.
* Principle 4: The nine ontical levels of ICC. They were grouped under three captions: Prolegomena (1-3), life sciences (4-6) and human output (7-9):
:# Structure and form
:# Matter and energy
:# Cosmos and earth
:# Biosphere
:# Anthroposphere
:# Sociosphere
:# Material products (economics and technology)
:# Intellectual products (knowledge and information)
:# Spiritual products (products of mind and culture)

* Principle 5: Knowledge fields are structured by categories, based on the Aristotelian form-categories, under a digital position scheme, a kind of scaling rule for subdividing a given field as follows:
:# General area: problems, theories, principles (axiom and structure)
:# Object area: objects, kinds, parts, properties of objects
:# Activity area: methods, processes, activities
:# Field properties or first characterization   
:# Persons or secondary characterization
:# Societies or tertiary characterization
:# Influences from outside
:# Applications of the field to other fields
:# Field information and synthesizing tasks
:The digital position scheme, called Systematifier, has  also been used for structuring the entire system via the categories figuring on the upper zero level.

An example of its application is the structure of the classification system for knowledge organization literature [http://www.isko.org/scheme.php Gliederung der Klassifikationsliteratur]. (A simplified version with an additional introduction is given in,&lt;ref name="WEAAZ2014" /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;71)

* Principle 6: The ontical levels outlined under principle 4 conform to the „integrative level theory“ which means that every level is integrated in the following one. In addition, each knowledge area presumes the following one.
* Principle 7: The combination potential of knowledge fields (interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity)is determined by the digital position scheme. (Examples are given in,&lt;ref name="WEAAZ2014" /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;103-4)
* Principle 8: The categories of the zero-level are general concepts, their possible subdivisions could once be used for classificatory statements. (These subdivisions still need elaboration)
* Principle 9 and 10: These relate to the combination potential of classificatory statements with space and time concepts. (Still to be elaborated)
* Principle 11: The system's mnemotechnical aspect relies on the fixed system position codes and on the 3x3 form- and subject-categories.
* Principle 12: The combination potential of system position 1, 8 and 9 make ICC to a self-networking system which complies with the present scientific development.

== ICC in Matrix Form ==

The first two levels of ICC can be represented by following matrix.

[[File:ICC as a Matrix.png|maxi|840px|ICC as a Matrix with the first two hierarchical levels]]

The first hierarchical level of the 9 subject categories results from the first vertical array under codes 1-9.  The second hierarchical level of subject categories is structured by the 9 functionally ordered form categories, listed in the first horizontal line under codes 01-09. Some exceptions are mentioned in principle 7.

== Research work with ICC ==

=== Exploration of automatic classification with ICC ===
For classifying web documents as conceived by Jens Hartmann, University of Karlsruhe, Prof.Walter Koch, University of Graz, has explored in his Institute for Applied Information Technology Research Society (AIT) the application of ICC to automatically classifying metadata of some 350.000 documents. This was facilitated by data generated within the framework of an EU-supported project [http://www.europeana-local.at "EuropeanaLocal"] . For this exploration, three ICC hierarchical levels have been used for some 5000 terms. The result is described in the report of Christoph Mak.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Christian Mak|Periodical=Bericht des Instituts "Angewandte Informationstechnik Forschungsgesellschaft mbh" (AIT)|Title=Kategorisierung des Datenbestandes der EuropeanaLocal-Österreich anhand der ICC |PublicationPlace=Graz|Year=2011|Date=  2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof.Koch regarded a classification degree of almost 50% as a good result, considering that only a shortened version of ICC had been used. In order to reach a better result one would have needed 1–2 years. Also an index of all terms with their codes could be achieved under these explorations.

=== Data Linkage with ICC ===
Motivated by the work of an Italian research Group in Trento on ''Revising the Wordnet Domains Hierarchy: semantics, coverage and balancing'',&lt;ref name="FGinTrnto"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Luisa Bentivogli|Surname2=Pamela Forner|Surname3=Bernardo Magnini|Surname4=Emanuele Pianta|Periodical=Proceedings of COLING 2004 Workshop on "Multilingual Linguistic Resources|Title=[http://multiwordnet.fbk.eu/paper/coling04-ws-WDH.pdf Revising WordNet Domains Hierarchy: Semantics, Coverage, and Balancing] |PublicationPlace=Geneva, Switzerland|Year=2004|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;101-108|Date=  2004|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which the DDC codes were used, Prof. Ernesto DeLuca et al. showed in a study that for such case the use of ICC could lead to essentially better results. This was shown in two contributions: ''Including knowledge domains from the ICC into the Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud (LLD)'' &lt;ref name=" IKDfICC"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ernesto William DeLuca et al|Periodical=Knowledge Organization in the 21st Century. Between Historical Patterns and Future Prospects. Proc.13th Int. ISKO Conf.|Title=Including Knowledge Domains from the ICC into the Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud |PublicationPlace=Krakau, Polen|Year=2014|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;258-365|Date=  2014|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Die Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud: Eine mögliche Zugangsoptimierung?'',&lt;ref name="MLLDC"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ernesto William DeLuca et al|Periodical=Information, Wissenschaft &amp; Praxis|Title=Die Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud: Eine mögliche Zugangsoptimierung? |Volume=65, Heft 4-5|Publisher=De Gruyter|Year=2014|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;279-287|ISSN=1619-4292|Date=  2014|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the LLD was used in a meta-model which contains all resources with the possibility of retrieval and navigation of data from different aspects. By this, the existing work about many thousand knowledge fields (of  ICC) can be combined with the Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud, based on RDF/OWL representation of EuroWordNet and similar integrated lexical resources (MultiWordNet, MEMODATA and the Hamburg Metapher BD).

=== Semantic Web structuring with ICC ===
In October 2013, the computer scientist Hermann Bense, Dortmund, explored the possibilities for structuring the Semanic Web with ICC codes. He developed two approaches for a pictorial presentation of knowledge fields with their possible subdivisions. A graphic representation of those knowledge fields pertaining to the first two levels can be found under [http://www.ontology4.us/english/Ontologies/Science%2520Ontology/index.html Ontology4]. The inclusion of the third hierarchical level has been envisaged as the next step.

== Some potential applications of ICC in its present form ==
# Possibility to roughly structure documents, especially bibliographies and reference works.
# Structuring personal repertories, e.g. a [[Who’s Who]] in ''Who’s Who in Classification and Indexing''&lt;ref name="whoiswho"&gt;{{citation/core|EditorSurname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|Title=Who's Who in Classification and Indexing |Publisher=INDEKS Verlag|PublicationPlace=Frankfurt|Year=1983|Date=  1983|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Supporting the recollection of statistics by knowledge fields, e.g. also concerning university professors, statistics of academies, of institutions, of teachers in special education
# Publishing houses could take up ICC codes for their products to help later sorting by knowledge fields.
# As a standard classification ICC may be used in many cases, especially in industry,  [[knowledge management]] and [[knowledge engineering]].
# With the definition of all its terms a lexicon of knowledge fields could be published. This could also be used for such lexica in other languages.&lt;ref name="lexikon"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|Periodical=Knowledge Organisation 39, No.2|Title=A systematic new lexicon of all knowledge fields based on the Information Coding Classification. |Year=2012|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;142-150|Date=  2012|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# As an example, ICC could be used to compare ongoing scientific activities on a European or world-wide scale.

# Similar to the [[Unified Medical Language System]] (UMLS) for medicine such a Unified System of Knowledge Fields could be held available in many languages and thus reach a global understanding of knowledge fields.
# The alphabetical index to all knowledge field concepts could be used for comparisons with other such indexes to help in finding the missing fields in the different universal classification systems.

'''Kennixton Farmhouse''' is a 17th-century [[farmhouse]] originally built at Kennexstone, [[Llangennith]], Gower, and currently located at [[St Fagans National History Museum]], [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/stfagans/buildings/kennixton/ Historical Buildings – St Fagans: National History Museum – Kennixton Farmhouse]. Accessed 27 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a Grade II listed building.&lt;ref name="BLB"/&gt;

The house was built around 1610, and extended over a period.  Inside can be seen an example of a [[box-bed]] or "cupboard bed" and a sleeping platform over the fireplace, typical of houses in the [[Gower]] peninsula at this period.&lt;ref name=gtj&gt;[http://education.gtj.org.uk/en/item1/27201 Gathering the Jewels: Kennixton Farmhouse interior] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211051101/http://education.gtj.org.uk/en/item1/27201 |date=2013-12-11 }}. Accessed 27 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.gtj.org.uk/en/blowup1/21003 Gathering the Jewels: Cupboard bed, Kennixton Farmhouse]. Accessed 27 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Its exterior walls are painted a bright red; the original pigment included ox blood and lime and may have been intended as a kind of charm against witches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/1823/?article_id=171 National Museum of Wales Press Release, "Kennixton — Blood Red Farmhouse celebrates 50 years at St Fagans: National History Museum", 9 December 2005]. Accessed 28 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that it simply showed that the family were rich enough to be able to afford this type of pigment.

The main living room or "kitchen" is an addition, dating from around 1680, as is the wooden staircase and sleeping area above it.  The walls of the dining room (originally the only ground-floor room) are painted with a stencilled decoration of a type which pre-dates the general use of wallpaper.&lt;ref name=gtj/&gt;  This room was used as the interior of Captain Blamey's cottage in the filming of the BBC's 2015 drama series, ''[[Poldark (2015 TV series)|Poldark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/blog/2015-05-22/Through-the-Keyhole-in-Kennixton/ Amgueddfa Blog: "Through the Keyhole in Kennixton". 22 May 2015]. Accessed 15 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The farmhouse was donated to the museum (then called the Welsh Folk Museum) in 1951 by its then owner, Mr J B Rogers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMDZ01_Kennixton_farmhouse_Gower_to_Welsh_Folk_Museum_Cardiff Kennixton farmhouse Gower to Welsh Folk Museum Cardiff – Relocated Structures on Waymarking.com]. Accessed 27 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  It was one of the first properties to be rebuilt at the museum, which opened in 1948, and finance for carrying out the work was provided by the profits from the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]].  The farm buildings (barn and calves "cotts") that originally stood by the house were donated to the museum in the early 2000s and were also relocated to St Fagans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/stfagans/buildings/kennixton/ Historical Buildings – St Fagans: National History Museum – Kennixton Farmhouse].

'''Walter Kowalski'''&lt;ref name=only144&gt;{{cite book|title=If They Only Knew|first=Joanie|last=Laurer|authorlink=Joanie Laurer|isbn=0-06-109895-7|publisher=ReaganBooks |origyear=2001 |pages=144–145 |date=October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born '''Edward Władysław Spulnik'''; October 13, 1926 – August 30, 2008) was a Polish-Canadian [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]].

Kowalski wrestled for numerous [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]]s during his career, including the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) and World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF, now [[WWE]]), and was a known [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] professional wrestler. He held numerous [[Professional wrestling championship|championships]] including the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWWF World Tag Team Championship]] with [[Big John Studd]] billed as [[The Executioners (professional wrestling)#The Executioners (1970s)|The Executioners]] and [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managed]] by [[Lou Albano]].

After retiring in 1977, Kowalski started a [[professional wrestling school]] in [[Malden, Massachusetts]] and trained many professional wrestlers, including [[Triple H]], [[Chyna]], [[Eddie Edwards (wrestler)|Eddie Edwards]], [[Kofi Kingston]], [[Damien Sandow]], [[Fandango (wrestler)|Fandango]], [[Brittany Brown]], [[April Hunter]], [[John Kronus]], [[Perry Saturn]], and [[Tommaso Ciampa]].

==Early life==
The man later known as "Killer Kowalski" (he legally changed his name in 1963) was the son of [[Poles|Polish]] immigrants Antoni Spulnik and Maria Borowska; he, his older sister Wanda, and his younger brother Stanley were raised in [[Windsor, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/2008/08/30/6617311.html |title=Killer Kowalski dies |date=August 30, 2008 |first=Greg |last=Oliver |accessdate=April 14, 2012 |work=Slam! Sports |publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, he told interviewers that he never expected to be a wrestler &amp;ndash; by the age of 14, he was already {{convert|6|ft|4|in|cm|0}}, and because he was thin for his height, he began working out at the local [[YMCA]], but he had no plan to go into athletics at that time. When he entered college, his major was [[electrical engineering]]. He worked part-time at the Ford plant in [[Detroit]] to help pay his wage.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==
There are several stories of how he became a wrestler. The most common one is that while attending the [[University of Detroit]] (some sources say Assumption College in Windsor), he heard that there was an opportunity to make good pay by wrestling. He was only being paid $50 a week at the plant and was told he could make more as a wrestler.&lt;ref name="Dupont"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Kevin Paul | last = Dupont | title = A Lifetime of Learning | publisher = The Boston Globe | date = 1990-10-08 | page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since he already had an athletic build, he decided to give wrestling a try and began attending a wrestling school.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marrapese"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Nancy | last = Marrapese | title = A Quiet Life, Wild Memories for Killer | publisher = The Boston Globe | date = 1991-09-29 | page = NW13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he first wrestled professionally, he was known as Tarzan Kowalski,&lt;ref name="Burnett"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Thane | last = Burnett | title = Confessions of a Killer | publisher = [[Toronto Sun]] | date = 2005-01-24 | page = 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was also called Hercules Kowalski, Killer Kowalski (this nickname is used as early as 1950) and even The Polish Apollo, according to newspaper reports from 1950–51. During the Cold War his name was changed to Wladek Kowalski, which was supposed to sound more menacing.&lt;ref name="Simonich"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Milan | last = Simonich | title = Being a wrestling villain was a rewarding career | publisher = [[The Globe and Mail]] | date = 1998-11-13 | page = S7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kowalski wrestled from 1947 to 1977 in a number of organizations, including the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) and [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) as a [[heel (wrestling)|heel]].

Kowalski's rise in the business came quickly.  His first recorded match occurred on May 6, 1948, and by November 29 of the same year, Kowalski was facing [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]] champion [[Orville Brown]] in a heavyweight championship match. Kowalski stood out in his era for his larger-than-normal size, and for a faster-paced style in the ring.  He wrestled as a demonstrative "heel," or villain, except when facing the even-more-hated [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]].  In his matches with Rogers, Kowalski would adopt a more serious "babyface" approach.  Out of the ring, however, Kowalski was considered so friendly and polite that some wrestling promoters complained about the way he would "drop character" in public.

===Incidents===
On October 15, 1952, in a match in [[Montreal]] versus [[Eric Holmback|Yukon Eric]], Kowalski ripped off a part of Yukon Eric's ear while performing a knee drop.&lt;ref name=only144/&gt; In reality, Eric's ears were already badly [[Cauliflower ear|cauliflowered]] due to years of abuse and the injury was an accident, but it fortified Kowalski as being a ruthless villain who gleefully maims his opponents. Kowalski attempted to visit his opponent in the hospital and began laughing along with Eric at how silly the bandages looked, with Kowalski recalling years later, "I swear, the first thing I thought of was [[Humpty Dumpty]] on the wall. Yukon Eric looked at me, shook his head, and smiled. I started laughing and he laughed, too." When the incident was reported in the paper the next day, it stated that Kowalski showed up at the hospital and laughed ''at'' his victim rather than ''with'' him, furthering Kowalski's image as a heel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/magazine/19981112killer1.asp | title = Ring of legends: Killer Kowalski and other big names come to town to wrestle up support for charity  | date = 1998-11-12 | accessdate = 2008-08-31 | work = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | publisher = [[Block Communications]] | first = Milan | last = Simonich}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident sparked a long-running series of grudge matches between the two wrestlers which took place throughout North America.  By the time the feud had run out of steam several years later, Yukon Eric joked to Kowalski about the small size of an audience, "God, that's a lousy house.  I might have to sacrifice another ear."

Kowalski also gained some notoriety in [[Boston]] for an incident in late June 1958 when he was wrestling [[Pat O'Connor (wrestler)|Pat O'Connor]]. The guest referee was former boxing great [[Jack Dempsey]], who suffered a kick to the diaphragm and had to be hospitalized.  Dempsey did not blame Kowalski, and both said it was an accident, but this further cemented the Killer's reputation as a villain.&lt;ref name="Mauled"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Mauler Mauled | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 1958-08-03 | page = C6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, the top-rated Australian television talk show host [[Don Lane]] irritated Kowalski during an apparently friendly interview and was attacked with the Kowalski claw hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/01/05/1073151243650.html | title = Scream test | last = Molitorisz | first = Sacha | date = 2004-01-05 | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate = 2008-08-10 | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the late 1950s, Kowalski fought what was supposed to be a best two out of three match in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]] against Mr. Moto. Just before the bell starting the first fall, Kowalski had his back turned to Moto while doing some stretches in his corner. Moto raced across the ring and hit Kowalski over the head with one of the clogs with which he had walked into the ring. Of course, the referee did not see this happen. The bell rang and a seemingly dazed Kowalski staggered around the ring and was quickly pinned by Moto. Kowalski was billed as the heavyweight champion at that time (at least in eastern Massachusetts) and, as such, was not supposed to lose the match. Just after the second fall started, Kowalski was hit in the right eye with a pea or bean shot by someone in the audience using a pea shooter. Semi-blinded and genuinely stunned, Kowalski staggered around the ring covering his eye with his right hand. Moto did not know what to do. Finally, he approached Kowalski, bumped into him and fell to the mat. Kowalski reached down, applied the claw hold and Moto was not only counted out, but deemed by the referee too hurt to continue. The two raced out of the ring to a chorus of boos from the audience and dodged various objects being thrown at them. As a side note, the two had arrived 45 minutes late for the match. ''[[The Herald News|The Fall River Herald News]]'' reported in its next day morning edition that these two "mortal enemies" were late because the car in which they had ridden together to the match had broken down on the way.

In December 1972, Kowalski became the first wrestler to pin [[André the Giant]] in North America, in what was billed as a "Battle of the Giants."  Photographs from the [[Quebec City]] match helped to establish André's reputation in American wrestling magazines, since they showed him towering over the better-known Kowalski.  Kowalski had done much the same to boost [[Giant Baba]]'s fame in Japan, with a televised 1963 match.

===World Wide Wrestling Federation===
Kowalski became the main antagonist of [[Bruno Sammartino]] in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] in the 1960s and 1970s. Kowalski formed a tag team with fellow heel [[Gorilla Monsoon]] and took [[Red Berry (wrestler)|Red Berry]] as his manager; Monsoon and Kowalski held the [[WWWF United States Tag Team Championship]], winning the belts in two straight falls from [[Skull Murphy]] and [[Brute Bernard]] on [[Washington, D.C.]] television, and later losing to The Tolos Brothers in two straight falls in [[Teaneck, New Jersey]] in December 1963. On May 11, 1976, Kowalski won the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Championship]] with [[Big John Studd]].&lt;ref name=world/&gt; Both men wore black masks and tights and called themselves "[[The Executioners (professional wrestling)#The Executioners (1970s)|The Executioners]]". However, they were stripped of the championship, following the interference of a third Executioner during a title defense against [[Chief Jay Strongbow]] and [[Adnan Al-Kaissie|Billy White Wolf]]. The Executioners lost a match for the vacant title on December 6 to Strongbow and White Wolf and never regained the championship.&lt;ref name=world&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/ |title=Title History: World Tag Team Championship |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement and training===
After his WWF retirement in 1977,&lt;ref name="Simonich"/&gt; Kowalski started a [[professional wrestling school]] in [[Malden, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=only144/&gt; Due to his health, he ceased to be involved with it in 2003, and the school subsequently moved to [[North Andover, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chaotictc.com |title=Chaotic Training Center &amp;#124; Pro Wrestling School and Training in Mass |publisher=Chaotictc.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708134751/http://www.chaotictc.com/ |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the alumni of this school are [[Triple H]],&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt;&lt;ref name=only144/&gt; [[Chyna]],&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt;&lt;ref name=only144/&gt; [[Perry Saturn]],&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt;&lt;ref name=only144/&gt; [[John Kronus]],&lt;ref name=WWEBio/&gt; [[Brittany Brown]], [[Big John Studd]],&lt;ref name=WWEBio/&gt; [[Damien Kane]], Killer Kowalski Jr., Ron Zombie, [[Christopher Nowinski]],&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt; [[Matt Bloom|Tensai]],&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt;&lt;ref name=only144/&gt; [[April Hunter]], Ace Andrews, [[RJ Brewer]], [[Kazarian (wrestler)|Kazarian]], [[Nicole Raczynski]], Cadillac Joe D, [[Kenny Dykstra]], [[Damien Sandow]] and [[Fandango (wrestler)|Fandango]]. Kowalski continued to wrestle on independent shows into the early 1980s, and worked only sparingly after that. His last match took place in 1993, when Kowalski was 66 years old. Kowalski would remain a fixture on the Northeast independent wrestling scene taking autograph and personal appearances. His last appearance was in Jan 2008 for Top Rope Promotions at an event in North Adams, Ma where he came to the ring and put the claw on local wrestler "Gorgeous" Gino Giovanni and was declared the winner of the segment.

He also made numerous post-retirement television appearances, including ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' in 1982, and was featured in a comic role in [[Michael Burlingame (filmmaker)|Michael Burlingame]]'s [[surrealism|surrealist]] film ''To a Random'' in 1986. "Lost in the B-Zone", a [[music video]] for [[Birdsongs of the Mesozoic]] which was derived from this film, also prominently featured Kowalski.

On June 14, 2007, Kowalski was inducted into The [[National Polish-American Hall of Fame|National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070411/UPDATE/704110454&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Kowalski married for the first time to Theresa Ferrioli on June 19, 2006. Kowalski, who was 79 years old at the time, joked that he only married 78-year-old Ferrioli after "she told me she was pregnant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/kowalski0807 | title = What I've Learned: Killer Kowalski | work = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] | publisher = [[Hearst Corporation]] | first = Cal | last = Fussman | date = 2007-08-03 | accessdate = 2008-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had known her since 1998, and she was surprised when he proposed, since he had been known as a lifelong bachelor.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Joe | last = Fitzgerald | title = Grappling With Mortality | publisher = [[Boston Herald]] | date = 2008-07-28 | page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a vegetarian in the late 1960s and claimed to be the only one in professional wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wordpress.vegetarianusa.com/?p=184 | title = A Vegetarian Travel Guide exclusive interview with the world-famous wrestler...Walter "Killer" Kowalski | last = Harris | first = Barry | work = vegetarianusa.com | accessdate = 2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would not drink milk or alcohol, and he did not smoke. He would not even drive with wrestlers who smoked, which limited his traveling options. Reportedly, he also was an [[Raw veganism|all-raw-food vegan]] for a while.&lt;ref&gt;He commented top companions and others while dining in all-vegetarian restaurants; claims confirmed by his friends at the time&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, op cit.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a popular speaker in the local [http://www.BostonVeg.org Boston Vegetarian Society] and Boston-area vegetarian restaurants, including the now-closed Country Life Vegetarian Restaurant, where he discussed both wrestling and his vegetarian values, and appeared on Malden's cable TV station, [http://www.MATV.org MATV], where he also shared anecdotes about vegetarian values and his more humorous wrestling experiences and observations.

==Death==
Kowalski began experiencing escalating health problems in the time leading up to his death.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"/&gt; ''The Sun'' received the report on Kowalski from his friend, wrestling legend [[Bruno Sammartino]], that Kowalski had to go to a rehabilitation center in [[Everett, Massachusetts]], where he was recovering from a knee injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/wrestling/blog/2008/04/killer_kowalski_in_hospital.html | title = Killer Kowalski in hospital | last = Eck | first = Kevin | date = 2008-04-17 | work = [[The Baltimore Sun]] | publisher = [[Tribune Company]] | accessdate = 2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seemed he was getting better, until he suffered a heart attack on August 8, 2008. According to Slam! Sports, the ''Quincy Patriot Ledger'', and other sources, Kowalski's family was apprised that he would not recover. When Kowalski was taken off life support on August 18, subsequent news reports erroneously stated that he had died. Kowalski died on August 30, 2008.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; He was survived by his wife and family.

'''Kittisak Prokati''' ({{lang-th|กิตติศักดิ์ ปรกติ}}; {{RTGS|Kittisak Prokkati}}; born 7 December 1956) is a Thai legal scholar. He is assistant professor of [[comparative law]], [[civil law (area)|civil law]] and [[philosophy of law]] at the [[Faculty of Law, Thammasat University]].

== Education and academic career ==
Kittisak graduated from the Faculty of Law, Thammasat University, and received a diploma in comparative law from the [[University of Strasbourg]] in France, as well as a master's degree ([[Magister Juris]]) and a [[research doctorate]] in law (Dr. iur.) from the [[University of Bonn]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ข้อมูลนักวิชาการ (กิตติศักดิ์ ปรกติ, ผศ.ดร.) |trans-title=Scholar's info (Kittisak Prokati, Assistant Professor Doctor) | url = http://topscholar.org/blog/2008/01/29/%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B9%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3-%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B4/ | publisher = Topscholar | date = n.d. | accessdate = 2014-05-11 | language = Thai }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://law.tu.ac.th/about-tu-law.php?lang=th&amp;view=team | title = เกี่ยวกับคณะ: คณาจารย์ |trans-title=About TU Law: Teaching Faculty | publisher = Faculty of Law, Thammasat University | date = n.d. | accessdate = 2014-05-11 | language = Thai }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He teaches comparative law, civil law and philosophy of law at the Faculty of Law, Thammasat University. He was a deputy dean of law at Thammasat University and is the President of the Thammasat University Faculty Senate and a Thammasat University Councillor.&lt;ref name="background"&gt;{{cite web|title=ประวัติกรรมการสภามหาวิทยาลัย (กิตติศักดิ์ ปรกติ) |trans-title=University councillor's background (Kittsak Prokati) |url=http://www.tu.ac.th/org/ofrector/tu_council/record/kittisak.htm |date=n.d. |accessdate=2014-05-11 |publisher=Thammasat University |language=Thai |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093259/http://www.tu.ac.th/org/ofrector/tu_council/record/kittisak.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a chair professor in international legal studies at the Graduate School of Law, [[Kyushu University]].&lt;ref name = "lgbt"&gt;{{cite web | title = กิตติศักดิ์ ปรกติ: ตำนานรักร่วมเพศ (ในเชิงกฎหมายอย่างกว้าง ๆ) | url = http://www.osknetwork.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=216 | date = n.d. | accessdate = 2014-05-19 | language = Thai | publisher = OSK Network }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kittisak has initiated the establishment of a Centre for German Legal Studies and an expert lectureship of the [[German Academic Exchange Service]] at the Faculty of Law, Thammasat University. In 2009 he was awarded the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] ''(Bundesverdienstkreuz)'' for his efforts to further exchange and co-operation between the legal systems of Thailand and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Bundesverdienstkreuz für Honorarkonsuln und Rechtsprofessor |newspaper=Newsletter |publisher=Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany, Bangkok |date=November 2009 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.thaizeit.de/thailand-themen/news/artikel/bundesverdienstkreuz-fuer-honorarkonsulin-und-rechtsprofessor.html |title=Bundesverdienstkreuz für Honorarkonsuln und Rechtsprofessor |publisher=Thaizeit.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside his Thammasat Law Faculty colleague [[Worachet Pakeerut]], he serves in the supervisory board of the German-Southeast Asian Center of Excellence for Public Policy and Good Governance (CPG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.cpg-online.de/index.php?area=1&amp;p=static&amp;page=organizationstructure |title=Persons |publisher=German-Southeast Asian Center of Excellence for Public Policy and Good Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has published works about [[LGBT]], the reformation of Thai law under European influence (2003), [[personality rights]] (2003), and background and fundamental legal methodology of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[common law]] (2004),&lt;ref name = "background"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "lgbt"/&gt; as well as a textbook on general principles of [[natural person]]s and [[legal personality|legal persons]] (2007).

== Political views and activism ==
Kittisak supports section 112 of the Thai Criminal Code (known as [[Lèse majesté in Thailand|lèse majesté]] law) and the categorisation of the section as an offence against national security. However, he agreed that the current fifteen year imprisonment is immoderate and the current enforcement of section 112 is problematical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = กิตติศักดิ์ ปรกติ: ต้องยกย่องสถาบันให้ดำรงอยู่อย่างมีเหตุผลสอดคล้องกับหลัก ปชต. |trans-title=Kittisak Prokati: the monarchy must be upheld reasonably and in line with democratic principles | url = http://www.isranews.org/thaireform/thaireform-talk-interview/thaireform-talk-politics/item/13531--q-q-sp-2088949278.html | publisher = Isra News | date = 2012-02-06 | accessdate = 2014-05-11 | language = Thai }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2013–14 Thai political crisis]], Kittisak became known as a supporter of the oppositional "[[People's Democratic Reform Committee]]" (PDRC). Kittisak delivered several speeches against the [[Pheu Thai Party]] on the PDRC stage. He also supports many ideas and operations of the PDRC, including the creation of an unelected people's council to oversee political reform and the seizure of public offices, which he described as a peaceful revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = กิตติศักดิ์ย้ำสภาประชาชนมีได้ตามรัฐธรรมนูญ รัฐละเมิดประชาชนมีสิทธิปกป้อง |trans-title=Kittisak insists the possibility of creating a people's council and the people's right to protect themselves from the state-committed violation | url = http://www.manager.co.th/politics/viewnews.aspx?NewsID=9560000148000 | date = 2013-11-26 | accessdate = 2014-05-11 | publisher = Manager | language = Thai }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = กิตติศักดิ์ ปรกติ ขึ้นเวทีต้านระบอบทักษิณ ชี้เป็นรัฐบาลนอกกฎหมายหลังปฏิเสธศาล รธน. |trans-title=Kittisak Prokati on anti-Thaksin stage, condemning the government after denying charter court decision | language = Thai | date = 2013-11-28 | accessdate = 2014-05-11 | publisher = Prachatai | url = http://prachatai.com/journal/2013/11/50025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = กิตติศักดิ์อ้างชัยวัฒน์ยึดสถานที่ราชการเป็นสันติวิธีเชิงรุก |trans-title=Kittisak cites Chaiwat's words, saying seizure of public offices is an active peaceful method | date = 2013-11-29 | accessdate = 2014-05-11 | publisher = Prachatai | language = Thai | url = http://prachatai.com/journal/2013/11/50059 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His assets and bank accounts have been frozen by the Department of Special Investigation since 20 December 2013 on grounds of financing the PDRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = อายัดเพิ่ม 20 แนวร่วม กปปส. กบฏ! | url = http://www.komchadluek.net/mobile/detail/20131220/175257.html | publisher = คมชัดลึก | date = 2013-12-20 | accessdate = 2014-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May 2014, the Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for him on the charge of insurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ศาลออกหมายจับ 30 แกนนำ กปปส. |trans-title=Court issued arrest warrants for 30 PDRC leaders | url = http://www.manager.co.th/Crime/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9570000053501 | date = 2014-05-14 | accessdate = 2014-05-14 | publisher = Manager | language = Thai }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also faces seven other serious charges. He surrendered himself to the court on 19 May 2014 and successfully requested a provisional release, using his assistant professor position as security for bail. A public prosecutor is scheduled to institute a case against him on 27 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = กิตติศักดิ์ อจ. นิติศาสตร์ มธ. 1 ใน 30 แกนนำ กปปส. ข้อหากบฎ เข้ามอบตัว ใช้ตำแหน่งประกัน |trans-title=Kittisak, TU law lecturer and one of thirty PDRC leaders, surrenders himself over the charge of insurrection and requests for provisional release, using his position to secure the bail | url = http://www.matichon.co.th/news_detail.php?newsid=1400480210&amp;grpid=&amp;catid=01&amp;subcatid=0100 | publisher = Matichon | date = 2014-05-19 | accessdate = 2014-05-19 | language = Thai }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accusations of plagiarism ==
On 8 May 2014, Wuttipong Pongsuwan, Minister of Defence Advisor, accused Kittisak of [[plagiarism|plagiarising]] the article ''Uniform Sales Law – The Experience with Uniform Sales Laws in the Federal Republic of Germany'' by [[Peter Schlechtriem]] and presenting it as his own article under the title of ''The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods of 1980''. The matter went viral on the internet. On 9 May 2014, Kittisak admitted that he did produce the latter work and he failed to mention Schlechtriem as the original producer. However, he said the work he produced was merely the lecture notes, not generally published.&lt;ref name = "statement"&gt;{{cite web | title = ประมวลวิวาทะ เมื่องานวิชาการของกิตติศักดิ์ ปรกติ เหมือนกับผลงานของโปรเฟสเซอร์เยอรมัน? |trans-title=Collection of statements: when an academic work of Kittisak Prokati is the same as that of a German professor | url = http://www.matichon.co.th/news_detail.php?newsid=1399740621&amp;grpid=03&amp;catid&amp;subcatid | date = 2014-05-11 | accessdate = 2014-05-11 | publisher = Matichon | language = Thai }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 2014, Associate Professor Prasit Piwawattanapanit from the Faculty of Law, Thammasat University, who is also a member of the salary promotion board of the faculty, stated that Kittisak submitted the work to the board for consideration in salary promotion and also introduced it to an international conference. When the board suspected the originality of the work, Kittisak explained that the name of Schlechtriem was omitted because of his haste in writing the article, technical errors and the mistake of his [[teaching assistant]]. Prasit, however, found the explanation unreasonable, as it appeared that many parts of the original article were modified in the manner that a person in haste or a mere teaching assistant would be unable to do. In addition, Kittisak explained that he used this work because he wanted to publish the work of Schlechtriem who was his teacher when he studied in Germany. But Prasit questioned this explanation, as Kittisak replaced the name of Schlechtriem with his own name. However, the faculty did not take any action in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ประสิทธิ์ ปิวาวัฒนพานิช: ตอบอาจารย์กิตติศักดิ์ ปรกติกรณี Lecture Notes เรื่อง อนุสัญญาว่าด้วยเรื่องซื้อขายระหว่างประเทศ (CISG) |trans-title=Prasit Piwawattanapanit: reply to Professor Kittisak Prokati on lecture notes concerning CISG | url = http://prachatai.com/journal/2014/05/53132 | publisher = Prachatai | language = Thai | author = Prasit Piwawattanapanit | date = 2014-05-10 | accessdate = 2014-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use {{ntsh}} with non-numeric user counts, for example:
{{ntsh|0}}Unknown
{{ntsh|1000}}Thousands

Please only add a sortable table if it puts e.g. all "millions" above all "thousands". Refer to talk page for consensus on this 
Also, please make sure the numbers shown on the table are "registered users" not "visitors"--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14801">'''Loan words in [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]]''', excluding the huge number of words from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]], originated mostly due to the centuries long interactions between the native population of [[Kerala]] and the trading (predominantly, spice trading) powers of the world. This included trading contacts with [[Arabia]], [[Persia]], [[Israel]] and [[China]] spanning millennia, and with European Colonial powers for several centuries.

==European contributions==
===Portuguese===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Portuguese language]] --&gt;
Most of the loan words from [[Portuguese language]] are for items which the native population lacked when the encounter with [[Portuguese empire]] happened from around the final years of the 15th century.
Portuguese was the [[List of lingua francas#Portuguese|lingua franca]] in Africa, Brazil, South Asia and parts of South East Asia during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The Portuguese Empire was the major ruling colonial power in South India during this period, they were first modern European power to encounter India on a large scale, and thus their language had a strong influence on Malayalam (similar to many other Indian languages).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=3qk-p5hKuccC&amp;lpg=PP1|title=Portuguese Vocables in Asiatic Languages: From the Portuguese Original of Monsignor Sebastião Rodolfo Dalgado|last=Dalgado|first=Sebastião Rodolfo|date=1988|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=9788120604131|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese language had also taken some words from Malayalam, and they should not be confused vice versa.
Some examples are ''jaca'' for Jack Fruit (from Chakka / ചക്ക in Malayalam), manga for mango (from Mangaa / മാങ്ങ) in Malayalam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23911">This is an incomplete '''list of painters in the collection of the Frans Hals Museum''', with the number of artworks represented, and sorted by century of birth. For more information about the collection which comprises more than 760 works, see [[Frans Hals Museum]]. More than 100 works are by unknown or anonymous painters, and though over 200 individual artists are in the collection, many of these are represented by only one work, which is often a commemorative portrait of a Haarlem politician. The collection was founded by the Haarlem city council and the first gallery was in the city hall itself. The highlights of the collection are the oldest works such as former altarpieces from Haarlem churches, but also large works for other former Haarlem institutions by [[Frans Hals]], [[Maarten van Heemskerck]], and [[Jan de Bray]]. Most of the artists in the collection were born in the 16th and 17th centuries. Only four women are represented with works in the collection, namely [[Judith Leyster]], [[Charley Toorop]] and the sisters [[Catharina Jacoba Abrahamina Enschedé|Catharina Jacoba]] and [[Christina Gerardus Enschedé]].

The '''Meat-shaped Stone''' ({{zh|c=肉形石|p=ròuxíngshí}}) is a piece of [[jasper]] carved into the shape of a [[Dongpo pork]]. It is part of the collection of the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]].  Although of only moderate importance from the point of view of [[art history]], it is a great popular favourite with visitors and has become famous.

The Meat-shaped Stone has been called the "most famous masterpiece" of the entire National Palace Museum,&lt;ref name="Hook"&gt;Leslie Hook. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118549131061379569 "The Jade Cabbage"] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. 27 July 2007. Retrieved 20 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and along with the [[Jadeite Cabbage]] and the [[Mao Gong Ding]], is today called one of the Three Treasures of the National Palace Museum, a redesignation from several less accessible, infrequently-displayed works.&lt;ref name="multiple1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.thu.edu.tw/~fineart/upfiles/news01167287663.doc |author=倪再沁 |title=神畫的形塑—論故宮三寶 |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been chosen by the public as the most important item in the museum's entire collection.&lt;ref name="Ju"&gt;Sam Ju. [http://www.taiwan-panorama.com/en/show_issue.php?id=2009109810083e.txt&amp;table=2&amp;h1=Art%20and%20Culture&amp;h2=Museums "The Crystallization of the Jadeite Cabbage."] Translated by David Smith. ''[[Taiwan Panorama]]''. October 2009. p. 83. Retrieved 20 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The stone was carved during the [[Qing dynasty]] from banded [[jasper]]. The layers of the stone accumulated naturally over the years, with various shades of hues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meat-shaped Stone|website=National Palace Museum|url=http://theme.npm.edu.tw/selection/Article.aspx?sNo=04001103&amp;lang=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The craftsman who carved the stone stained the skin, which resulted in a realistic looking piece of stone with multiple layers appearing like layers of fat and meat.

The victory of the [[Karaiyar]]s over the [[Mukkuvar]]s happened in the [[Shalivahana era|Saka era]] 1159, corresponding to the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=MTh4pixlifYC&amp;pg=PA61|title=Crucible of Conflict: Tamil and Muslim Society on the East Coast of Sri Lanka|last=McGilvray|first=Dennis B.|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2008|isbn=0822341611|location=|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 7700 Karaiyar chieftains from [[Kanchipuram]], [[Puhar|Kaveripattinam]] and [[Kilakarai]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] arrived in Sri Lanka under the invitation of [[Parakramabahu VI of Kotte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=LCjjAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Mukkara+Hatana+kanchipuram&amp;dq=Mukkara+Hatana+kanchipuram&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiStuK7ssvXAhURS5oKHdj-BpkQ6AEIJjAA|title=Kurukshetra, Volume 4|last=|first=|date=1978|publisher=Sri Lak-Indo Study Group|year=|isbn=|location=University of Michigan|pages=86|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The army was led by the chieftains ''Kurukula Nattu Thevar'', ''Adiarasa Adappan'', ''Varunasuriya Adappan'', ''Kurukulasuriya Mudaliyar'',  ''Bharathakulasuriya Mudaliyar'', ''Arasakulasuriya Mudaliyar'' and their main royal chief ''Manikka Thalaivan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?hl=no&amp;id=0EBCAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=manikka+kurukula&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=manikka|title=The Ceylon Antiquary and Literary Register|last=|first=|date=1922|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''''Nel v Deputy Commissioner of Police, Grahamstown''''', an important case in [[South Africa|South African]] [[Criminal procedure in South Africa|criminal procedure]], Nel was the owner of an [[amusement park]] in [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]] which was open to the public. A head [[constable]] and sub-inspector entered this park and came to the conclusion that five machines were [[gambling]] instruments. Nel knew that both were police officers. He invited them to inspect and operate the machines, and even offered to open them up and show how they worked; he was quite co-operative.

After searching or inspecting the machines, and even playing on at least some of them, the officers came to the conclusion that five of the machines were illegal. They determined to seize and remove them.

Nel argued that he had consented only to a search; he had not consented to a seizure.

The court held that, when a police official above the rank of [[sergeant]] has reasonable grounds for believing that a search without a warrant is necessary, the consent to the search by the person suspected does not deprive that official of his right to seize incriminating articles, any more than consent could prevent the official, armed with a search warrant from seizing the articles.

One cannot remove consent, therefore, at the seizure stage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3744">The '''Peninsula Conflict Resolution Center''' (PCRC), founded in 1986, is a [[nonprofit]] organization that serves individuals, groups, and organizations in [[San Mateo County]], [[California]].  As a neutral third party, PCRC assists people in conflict to develop mutually acceptable agreements.  It offers [[mediation]], [[Facilitation (business)|facilitation]], [[training]], and [[community building]] services.  It is the largest provider of community-based conflict management and prevention services in San Mateo County.

== Mission ==
The Peninsula Conflict Resolution Center's mission is to promote collaboration and active engagement in the communities it serves.[http://www.pcrcweb.org/about/about.jsp]

== Mediation ==
PCRC's community mediation program is available for free or low cost to everyone who lives or works in San Mateo County. With the help of approximately 160 trained volunteer mediators, PCRC handles over 500 mediation cases and conducts approximately 150 mediations per year.[http://www.pcrcweb.org/mediation/community.jsp]

Typical issues resolved in the community mediation program are: neighbor disputes about noise, fences, parking and yard/tree maintenance; landlord/tenant conflicts; disagreements between a consumer and a business; workplace disputes; and other interpersonal situations.

== Facilitation ==
Through its facilitation services, PCRC helps organizations plan and run meetings.  When facilitating a meeting, PCRC seeks to promote participation, support dialogue in communities, aid decision making, and help groups work productively.

Some situations in which PCRC provides facilitation services include organizations that need to develop a strategic plan, public meetings in which neighbors come together to share concerns and ideas, staff or work groups who want to work out a conflict, organizational retreats, and city government public participation processes.

Unlike most of PCRC's services, facilitation usually requires a fee.

== Training ==
PCRC offers workshops to groups and organizations, training participants in communication and conflict resolution skills.

== Civic Engagement ==
The Civic Engagement Initiative, begun in 1997, is designed to increase residents' active involvement in their communities, schools, and democracy. [[Civic engagement]] can take many forms, including volunteering, voting, community organizing, mentoring, running for public office, and public dialogue.  The Civic Engagement Initiative seeks to build a sense of ownership and interconnectedness in communities and to help individuals understand that their participation matters.

Through the Civic Engagement Initiative, PCRC promotes parent involvement in schools, facilitates dialogues on public issues, trains community leaders, partners with community agencies and links residents to public policy makers.

As an expression of its global vision, PCRC also sponsors the local [[Jewish-Palestinian_Living_Room_Dialogue_Group|Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue]] with its domestic effectiveness and global impact.

In [[ghostlore]], a '''phantom vehicle''' is a purportedly ghostly or haunted vehicle, common in [[urban legend]]s and entertainment. The stories often describe cars that operate with no visible driver.

==Types of phantom vehicles==

===Cars and trucks===
* In 1982, two people in [[Kailua, Honolulu County, Hawaii|Lanikai]], [[Hawaii]] reported seeing a mysterious black car which disappeared and reappeared again a second later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.castleofspirits.com/stories01/ghostcar.html|title=Ghost Car In Lanikai|last=|first=|date=|work=Castle of Spirits|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20160313041713/http://www.castleofspirits.com/stories01/ghostcar.html|archive-date=2016-03-13|dead-url=|accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 1960s car that had [[bumper sticker]]s; the witness passed the car but it mysteriously reappeared ahead of the witness's car at several stoplights.

'''Quality infrastructure''' relates to all fields of [[metrology]], [[standardization]] and [[Test method|testing]], of [[quality management]] and [[conformity assessment]], including [[certification]] and [[accreditation]]. In the past, the abbreviation MSTQ (Metrology, Standardization, Testing and [[Quality Assurance]]) was used for this combination of single elements.

Quality infrastructure must ensure:

- elaboration and implementation of technical regulations for products and passage from compulsory standards to voluntary ones;&lt;br /&gt;
- application of good practice code regarding standardization;&lt;br /&gt;
- elimination of all measures that pose [[trade barrier]]s - not only [[customs]] taxes and quantitative restrictions, but all the measures with equivalent (protectionist) effects.

Quality infrastructure: Definition adopted in June 2017 by the DCMAS Network (BIPM, IAF, IEC, ILAC, ISO, ITC, ITU, OIML, UNECE and UNIDO) + the World Bank.

“The system comprising the organizations (public and private)together with the policies, relevant legal and regulatory framework, and practices needed to support and enhance the quality, safety and environmental soundness of goods, services and processes. 

The quality infrastructure is required for the effective operation of domestic markets, and its international recognition  is important to enable access to foreign  markets. It is a critical element in promoting and sustaining economic development, as well as environmental and social wellbeing. 

It relies on: 
• metrology
• standardization
• accreditation
• conformity assessment, and 
• market surveillance”

'''Rededjet''' (also readed as '''Ruddedet'''&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt;) is the name of a [[fiction|fictitious]] [[ancient Egypt]]ian female [[hero]] appearing in the fifth chapter of a story told in the legendary ''[[Westcar Papyrus]].'' She is said to have fulfilled a [[prophecy]] by giving birth to three future kings during the reign of king ([[pharaoh]]) [[Khufu]] ([[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th Dynasty]]), who received the prophecy from a [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]ian named [[Dedi]].

==Literary person==
Rededjet appears only in the fifth story of the ''Westcar Papyrus'' - there is no [[Archeology|archeological]] or [[History|historical]] evidence that she existed. Nevertheless, she is object of great interest for [[historian]]s and [[Egyptologist]]s, since her story gives information about the line of succession at the very beginning of the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|fifth dynasty]].&lt;ref name=VELP/&gt;&lt;ref name=MiLi/&gt;

==The wonder of Rededjet==
According to the ''Westcar Papyrus,'' Rededjet has a strong labor, and birth is difficult because she has to expect [[Multiple birth|triplets]]. The [[god]] [[Ra]], Lord of Sachebu, says to the gods [[Isis]], [[Nephthys]], [[Meskhenet]], [[Heqet]] and [[Khnum]]: “May you all go to Rededjet and release her from her trinity of children which are still in her womb and which will exercise their splendid office in the whole realm one day. So they can build [[temple]]s for you, take care of your offering tables, let your drink plates thrive and multiply your god's [[sacrifice]]s.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; And so the goddesses turn to Rededjet's house after they had [[Shapeshifting|transformed]] themselves into music-making dancers. The god Khnum himself turns into a porter. When they reach Rededjet's house they meet her husband Ra-User outside at the threshold, wearing his skirt upside-down and whining. The goddesses show him their [[menit]]s&lt;ref&gt;A ''Menjt'' is an ancient Egyptian musical instrument; see: Verena M. Lepper: ''Untersuchungen zu pWestcar. Eine philologische und literaturwissenschaftliche (Neu-)Analyse''. In: ''Ägyptologische Abhandlungen'', Band 70. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, {{ISBN|3-447-05651-7}}, page 228.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sistrum]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A Sistrum is also an ancient Egyptian musical instrument; see: Verena M. Lepper: ''Untersuchungen zu pWestcar. Eine philologische und literaturwissenschaftliche (Neu-)Analyse''. In: ''Ägyptologische Abhandlungen'', Band 70. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, {{ISBN|3-447-05651-7}}, page 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereupon Ra-User says: “See, there is a woman here who is suffering badly, for her birth is problematic.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; The goddesses say: “May thou cause that we can see her. See, we know how to relieve.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Ra-User replies: “Feeds!”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; The gods step in and go immediately to Rededjet, who is lying upstairs. They seal the room and then Isis stands before Rededjet, to catch the babies, Nephthys takes position behind, whilst Heqet accelerates the birth. Now Isis says: “May you, the one who is [[Userkaf|User-Re-ef]], be not too strong in her womb.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; And the baby comes out quickly, a healthy child of one cubit in size. His bones are solid, his equipment of limbs being like gold. His headdress is made of real [[lapis lazuli]]. After cutting the umbilical cord, purifying the baby and placing it in a brick-made bed, covered with soft sheets, Khnum makes the body strong. Meskhenet steps by and says: “This is a king who will exercise the rulership over the whole country!”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; After this, Isis stands again before Rededjet and says: “May you, whose name is [[Sahure]], stop kicking in her womb.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; And this baby, too, comes out quickly. It has the same extraordinary appearance like the baby before. And again Meskhenet blesses the child with the words: “This is a king who will exercise the rulership over the whole country!”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; A third and last time Isis stands before Rededjet and says: “May you, whose name is [[Neferirkare|Keku]],&lt;ref&gt;“Keku” is a historical prescription of Neferirkare's birthname “Kakai”; see: Verena M. Lepper: ''Untersuchungen zu pWestcar. Eine philologische und literaturwissenschaftliche (Neu-)Analyse''. In: ''Ägyptologische Abhandlungen'', Band 70. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, {{ISBN|3-447-05651-7}}, page 229.&lt;/ref&gt; stop being blind in her womb.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; And the third baby is blessed by Meskhenet, too. Now the gods leave the room, meet Ra-User and say: “Oh joy! Three children were born to you!”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Ra-User replies: “My ladies! What could I do for you? Give this [[barley]] to your porter, may you accept it as a gratuity, for making some [[beer]].”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Khnum shoulders himself with the jars of barley and the gods start turning home. On their way, Isis admonishes her companions with the words: “Haven't we come here for a good reason? What would that reason be, if we perform no [[miracle]] to these children! There were nothing we could tell to their father who made us come.″&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; The gods create three lordly crowns for the children and hide them in the jars of barley. Then they [[conjuration|conjure]] a downpour, as a reason to turn back to Ra-User's house. They say to Ra-User: “Please store the barley in a sealed storeroom for us until we come back from making music in the north.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; And the jars with barley are locked in a storeroom.

Some weeks later, Rededjet asks her maidservant: “Is our house prepared with all good things?”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; The maidservant answers: “It is prepared with every good thing, except some jars of beer. They were not brought yet.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Rededjet inquires: “Why is this not so, that the jars with beer were brought?”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; And the maidservant says: “There is nothing you could produce it with, except the barley of those musicians, the barley that is stored and sealed away.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Rededjet orders: “Go and take some, Ra-User will replace it when he comes home.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; And the maidservant opens the storeroom and all of a sudden she hears music, celebrations and cheering from afar - its festive mood typical for a royal [[enthronement|enthroning feast]]. The maid is baffled and tells everything to Rededjet. Rededjet enters the room too and also hears the festive noises. Now nosy she puts her ears on every box and jar, until she finds out, that the noises are coming from the jars of the musicians. Recognising the situation, Rededjet tells everything to Ra-User and they both spend the rest of the day celebrating.

One day Rededjet is bickering with the maidservant and the latter one is punished with beating. Infuriated, the maidservant says: “Is it because of that? Is it really because of the three kings you gave birth to? I will go to file charges with the king of [[Lower Egypt|Lower-]] and [[Upper Egypt]], Khufu, justified!”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; The maidservant leaves the house and goes to her elder brother. He is sitting beside his mother, binding [[flax]] and [[yarn]]. When he sees his sister, he says: “Where do ye go to, lil' sister?”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; And the maidservant tells him what she is up to. The brother says: “Shall it truly be done to come to me just to make me sup with [[betrayal]]?”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; He becomes angry and beats her, too. The maidservant now goes away to get some water and a [[Nile crocodile|crocodile]] snatches her. The brother goes to Rededjet to tell her what happened. Rededjet sits on the threshold, crying. The brother says: “What are you crying about, mistress?”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Rededjet answers: “It's about this little girl that grew up in this house.

Einleitung und Commentar''. In: ''Mitteilungen aus den Orientalischen Sammlungen''. Heft V, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Berlin 1890. page 12 – 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern analysis==
Historians and Egyptologists such as [[Adolf Erman]] and [[Kurt Heinrich Sethe]] once thought the tales of the ''Westcar Papyrus'' were mere [[folklore]], despite their knowledge of the historical correctness about the beginning of the fifth dynasty by describing the succession of the kings Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare. They also thought the novel of the ''Westcar Papyrus'' to be unfinished.&lt;ref name=AdEr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Udo Bartsch: ''Unterhaltungskunst A-Z (Taschenbuch der Künste)''. Henschel, Leipzig 1977 (2. Ausgabe), page 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Egyptologists such as [[Verena Lepper]] and [[Miriam Lichtheim]] deny this view and they argue that Sethe and Erman may have just failed to see the profundity of the novel. They both evaluate the story as some kind of narrated [[moral]] which deals with the theme of justice and what happens to traitors. Lepper points out, that the story of Rededjet might have been inspired by the historical figure of queen [[Khentkaus I]], who lived and maybe ruled at the end of the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth dynasty]].&lt;ref name=VELP/&gt; Khentkaus I is demonstrably entitled as “mother of two kings” and for a long time it has been thought that she may have borne Userkaf and Sahure. But new evidence shows that at least Sahure had a different mother (Queen [[Neferhetepes (Userkaf)|Neferhetepes]]), the implication of the ''Westcar Papyrus'' that the first three kings of the fifth dynasty had been siblings, is therefore incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Tarek El Awady: ''The royal family of Sahure. New evidence'', in: M. Barta; F. Coppens, J. Krjci (Hrsg.): ''Abusir and Saqqara in the Year 2005'', Prague 2006 {{ISBN|80-7308-116-4}}, p. 192-98&lt;/ref&gt; Since in the ''Westcar Papyrus'' Rededjet was concerned with the role of a future king's mother, the parallels between the biographies of the two ladies aroused special attention. The role of the maidservant is evaluated as being a key figure for a modern phrasing of indoctrinations about morality and betrayal. The maidservant wants to betray her mistress and is punished by [[destiny]]. The destiny is depicted here as a crocodile which snatches the traitor. The destination of the whole happening is to ensure the beginning of a new dynasty and by making the only danger disappear, the author of the ''Westcar Papyrus'' artfully creates some kind of [[happy ending]]. Lepper sees a strong clue in the way the story is finalized that the novel of the ''Westcar Papyrus'' actually ends here. The episode in which the crocodile snatches a traitor, is repeated several times, just like a [[refrain]], which is a typical writing element used in ancient Egyptian documents to close a chapter or text.&lt;ref name=VELP&gt;Verena M. Lepper: ''Untersuchungen zu pWestcar. Eine philologische und literaturwissenschaftliche (Neu-)Analyse''. ''Ägyptologische Abhandlungen'', Band 70. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, {{ISBN|3-447-05651-7}}, page 121 – 123, 146 – 148 &amp; 298 – 302.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MiLi/&gt;

==Archaeological basis==
In 2009 archaeological discoveries in Abusir, the royal necropolis of the Fifth Dynasty, have established that Neferirkare was in fact Sahure's son, who was himself Userkaf's son. Egyptologists now believe that the story of Rededjet is based on a conflation of two historical queens named Khentkaus. The first one lived during the 4th Dynasty and may have given birth to two kings, while the second one was the mother of two 5th Dynasty pharaohs, [[Neferefre]] and [[Nyuserre Ini]]. When Nyuserre was on the throne, he revived the cult of the first Khentkaus, as the similarities between both Khentkaus provided him with a genealogical link relating him to his Fourth Dynasty forebears. Th Egyptologist John Nolan believes that the mirroring position and names of the two Khentkaus queens was emphasised so that Nyuserre could legimitise his rule after the troubled times surrounding Neferefre's death.

The '''State Heraldic Museum''' in [[Kildare Street]], [[Dublin]], was founded in 1909 and was prior to its closure one of the first and oldest such museums in the world. It was housed in part of the building still occupied by the [[Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland]]. Among its many exhibits were representations of corporate and civic arms and the heraldic banners of the [[Chiefs of the Name]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Attraction_Review-g186605-d214985-Reviews-Heraldic_Museum_Genealogical_Office-Dublin_County_Dublin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Superpedia''' is an Indonesian free-access online dictionary and encyclopedia initiated by the Rumah Ilmu Indonesia Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rumahilmu.or.id|title=Rumah Ilmu Indonesia Official Website |publisher=Rumah Ilmu Indonesia}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 19 October 2008.

Superpedia runs on the [[MediaWiki]] software, which is also used to run [[Wikimedia Foundation]] projects. At the end of January 2010, the number of articles reached 30,000. At the end of January 2011, it was almost 70,000. Its main page is arranged into educational categories like biology, physics and mathematics, written in the [[Indonesian language]].

==Background==
The Superpedia project was created to close the digital literacy gap in Indonesia. The availability of digital dictionaries and encyclopedias is expected to help teachers to improve their knowledge. Only about 20 million of Indonesia's 230 million population can access the internet, so Superpedia is also distributed freely on CD and DVD.

With Indonesian education activists from schools and non-government organizations, Superpedia trains Indonesian educators to use Superpedia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.klubguru.com/2-view.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1243476055&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=3&amp; |title=Superpedia socialization at Rembang, Central Java |publisher=Klub Guru Indonesia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.smkti.net/2010/02/workshop-open-source-untuk-pendidikan.html |title=Superpedia Socialization at Samarinda, East Kalimantan | publisher= SMK TI Samarinda}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.klubguru.com/2-view.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1242746462&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=7&amp; |title=Superpedia Socialization at Surabaya, East Java |publisher= Klub Guru Indonesia}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other [[open-source software]].

==Development scheme==
Superpedia is designed to include a variety of Indonesian local content, such as Indonesian local languages, including [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]].

The scheme of the Superpedia development was released in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rumahilmuindonesia.net/e_learning/skema_superpedia.pdf| title= Superpedia Development Scheme | publisher=Rumah Ilmu Indonesia Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://groups.yahoo.com/group/cfbe/message/38065 | title= Superpedia Development Scheme | publisher= yahoogroups}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Donation and sponsorship==
Because Superpedia is a non-profit project, it depends on donations from users. In early 2010, Intel Indonesia became the first company to support Superpedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.inn-world.net/berita_detail1.php?id=2903| title= PT. Intel Indonesia dukung Superpedia (in Indonesian) |publisher= inn-world.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand''''' is an online [[encyclopedia]] created by the [[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] of the [[Government of New Zealand|New Zealand Government]]. The project was established in 2002 and the website launched in 2005. Its first build was completed in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mch.govt.nz/what-we-do/websites-we-run/te-ara-encyclopedia-new-zealand |title=Te Ara – The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date=29 January 2016 |work=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The encyclopedia was edited by [[historian]] [[Jock Phillips]] and had a staff of writers, editors, image and resource researchers and designers. It is organised by themes, and its first theme focused on telling the stories of New Zealanders. It covers the migration of peoples to New Zealand, and the history of their settlement – both New Zealand's indigenous [[Māori people]], and other immigrant groups.

An overview section, "New Zealand in Brief", presents concise information and facts about the country.

In 2006 a second thematic group of entries was published entitled "Earth, Sea and Sky" and covering ocean fish, sea and shorebirds and other marine life, the interactions of people and the sea, the country's natural resources, and shaping forces such as geology, volcanology, weather and climate. Distinctively New Zealand features are the main focus of the content, and scientific and technical data is presented within its social and human context.

''Te Ara'''s third theme, "The Bush", was launched in late 2007. It covers New Zealand's indigenous landscapes, forests, plants and animals, and the ways that people have used them or attempted to understand them. "The Bush" comprises more than 100 entries, covering such topics as early mapping, [[tramping]], conifer–broadleaf forests, [[taniwha]], Māori exploration, threatened species, logging native forests, [[moa]], [[kiwi]] and a great deal more.

Later themes were The Settled Landscape (2008), Economy and the City (2010), Social Connections (2010), Government and Nation (2012), Daily Life, Sport and Recreation (2013), and Creative and Intellectual Life (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/who-is-te-ara |title=Who is Te Ara? |work=Te Ara – The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous official New Zealand encyclopedia was ''[[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]]'', first published in 1966 and edited by [[A.H. McLintock]]. A digitised version of this work now forms part of the ''Te Ara'' website. The major New Zealand encyclopedia before that was ''[[The Cyclopedia of New Zealand]]'', published between 1897 and 1908, a commercial venture in which businesses or people usually paid to be covered.

Entries on topics relating substantially to Māori are presented in [[Māori language|Māori]] as well as English.

The ''[[Dictionary of New Zealand Biography]]'' was integrated into ''Te Ara'' in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/te-ara-a-history/page-10 |title=Te Ara – a history – Biographies |work=Te Ara – The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Testery''' was a section at [[Bletchley Park]], the British [[codebreaking]] station during [[World War II]]. It was set up in July 1942 under Major [[Ralph Tester]].{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 1 Introduction: 14 Organisation, 14A Expansion and Growth, (b) Three periods, p. 28}} Four founder members were Tester himself and three senior cryptographers were Captain [[Jerry Roberts]], Captain Peter Ericsson and Major Denis Oswald. All four were fluent in German. From 1 July 1942 on, this team switched and was tasked with breaking the German High Command’s most top-level code [[Lorenz cipher|Tunny]] after Bill Tutte successfully broke Tunny system in Spring 1942.

The Testery used hand decrypting methods to break Tunny traffic. Within one year of its foundation, the Testery had deciphered 1.5 million texts by these methods. By the war's end in [[Europe]] in May 1945, the Testery had grown to nine cryptographers, a team of 24 ATS, a total staff of 118, organised in three shifts working round the clock.

The logical structure of the Tunny system was worked out by mathematician Bill Tutte ([[William Thomas Tutte]]) in the Spring of 1942. Tunny had 12 wheels, and was more advanced, complex, faster and far more secure than the well-known 3-4 wheeled [[Enigma machine]]. The Germans were convinced that the Tunny cipher system was unbreakable. Tunny was the cipher system which carried only the highest grade of intelligence: messages from the German Army Headquarters in Berlin and the top generals and field marshals on all fronts. Some were signed by Hitler himself. Tens of thousands of Tunny messages were intercepted by the British and broken at Bletchley Park by Captain Roberts and his fellow codebreakers in the Testery. These messages contained much vital insight into top-level German thinking and planning.

After the Testery had been breaking Tunny for a year by hand, the [[Newmanry]] became active from July 1943 under [[Max Newman]]. Mathematicians in the Newmanry used machine methods to speed up breaking Tunny. Early on, a machine called [[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)|Heath Robinson]] was produced, to help speed up one stage — breaking of the chi wheels, but the Robinson was slow and not reliable. In February 1944 a new machine called "[[Colossus computer|Colossus]]" became operational; it was the world's first electronic computer. Colossus was designed and built in only ten months by [[Tommy Flowers]] of the G.P.O. (Post Office). This had far greater capacity and speed than the Robinson and so the whole breaking process became much faster. The Colossus was essential for making the very fast counts needed to work out the "de-chis", but the psi-wheels and motor-wheels were still broken by hand in the Testery.

The Testery was hand code-breaking Tunny for 12 months before the Robinson machine was produced and for 19 months before Colossus operated. With the help of the Newmanry, the Testery broke up to 90% of the traffic given to them to work on in the Colossus period.

The information provided by Tunny enabled the Allies to ascertain German movements, saving thousands of lives at critical junctures such as [[D-Day]] and the [[Battle of Kursk]] in the Soviet Union. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] gave the best summary after [[World War II]]. He said that "Bletchley decrypts shortened the War by at least two years". Tunny played a very important role in all of this, a war which was costing at least 10 million lives a year. A great deal of this was down to Bill Tutte.

The story of Enigma (declassified in the 1970s) is well known, but the story of Tunny, Germany's top-secret cipher machine, was only declassified a few years ago. Most of the cryptographers in the Testery died before they could tell their stories. For the first time, on 25 October 2011, a BBC Timewatch programme titled ''Code-breakers: Bletchley Park’s Lost Heroes'',  about the Testery, Tunny, Bill Tutte and Tommy Flowers, was produced, featuring testimony from Jerry Roberts.&lt;ref name=timewatch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016ltm0 |website=BBC |title= Code-Breakers: Bletchley Park's Lost Heroes |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of senior executives and codebreakers on [[Lorenz cipher|Tunny]] in the Testery ==
* [[Ralph Tester]]    linguist and head of Testery (not a codebreaker)
* [[Jerry Roberts]]   shift-leader, linguist and senior codebreaker
*  Peter Ericsson shift-leader, linguist and senior codebreaker
*  Victor Masters shift-leader (not a codebreaker)
*  Denis Oswald linguist and senior codebreaker
* [[Peter Hilton]]    codebreaker and mathematician
* [[Peter Benenson]]  codebreaker
* Peter Edgerley codebreaker
* John Christie codebreaker  
* Jack Thompson codebreaker
* [[Roy Jenkins]]     codebreaker (later moved on to wheel setter)
* [[Tom Colvill]]     General Manager 
By the war's end in [[Europe]] in May 1945, the Testery had grown to nine cryptographers, a team of 24 ATS, a total staff of 118, organised in three shifts working round the clock.

'''''The Rocklopedia Fakebandica''''', by T. Mike Childs, is an illustrated encyclopedia of [[fictional musical group]]s and musicians, as seen in movies and television. It was officially released November 6, 2004. The book catalogs such better-known fake bands as [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]], [[The Blues Brothers]], [[The Rutles]], and [[The Chipmunks]], along with dozens of less well known ones. The book takes a light-hearted, humorous approach, often pointing out the discrepancies between the experiences of real bands and musicians and the unlikely adventures fictional ones have. 

The book grew out of a website started by the author in 2000. The website includes fictional bands from other sources, such as books and TV commercials, as well as many bands not found in the book.

==History==
[[File:Time Out Hong Kong Magazine Launch Cover.jpg|thumb|''Time Out Hong Kong'' launch cover]]

''Time Out'' was first published  in 1968 as a London listings magazine by [[Tony Elliott (publisher)|Tony Elliott]], who used birthday money to produce a one-sheet pamphlet.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/419e3992-0665-11e2-bd29-00144feabdc0.html | title=Time Out abandons its cover price| author = Robert Budden| date= 24 September 2012| newspaper= Financial Times| accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]] as co-editor.&lt;ref&gt;Old Grey Whistle Test DVD Vol 3; Bob Harris speaking before Track 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The first product was titled "Where It's At", before being inspired by [[Dave Brubeck]]'s album ''[[Time Out (album)|Time Out]]''.&lt;ref name=refb&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/57/Time-Out-Group-Ltd.html| title=Time Out Group Ltd.| publisher=Reference for business| accessdate=16 June 2015| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618151622/http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/57/Time-Out-Group-Ltd.html| archivedate=18 June 2015| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Time Out began as an alternative magazine alongside other members of the [[underground press]] in the UK, but by 1980 it had abandoned its original collective decision-making structure and its commitment to equal pay for all its workers, leading to a strike and the foundation of a competing magazine, ''[[City Limits (magazine)|City Limits]]'', by former staffers. By now its former radicalism has all but vanished.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, A. (2007). "The Alternative Press". In K. Coyer, T. Dowmunt &amp; A. Fountain (eds.), ''The Alternative Media Handbook'' (p. 54). London; New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; As one example of its early editorial stance, in 1976 London's ''Time Out'' published the names of 60 purported CIA agents stationed in England.&lt;ref name="'70s 51"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum |year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York |isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early issues had a print run of around 5,000 and would evolve to a weekly circulation of 110,000 as it shed its radical roots.&lt;ref name=adweek&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.adweek.com/news/press/can-time-out-s-tony-elliott-weather-storm-132910?page=1| title= Can Time Out's Tony Elliott weather the storm?

The flavour of the magazine was almost wholly the responsibility of its designer, Pearce Marchbank. Marchbank was invited by Tony Elliott to join the embryonic &lt;i&gt;Time Out&lt;/i&gt; in 1971. Turning it into a weekly, he produced its classic logo, [and] established its strong identity and its editorial structure—all still used world-wide to this day.  He also conceived and designed the first of the &lt;i&gt;Time Out&lt;/i&gt; guide books. ... He continued to design for &lt;i&gt;Time Out&lt;/i&gt; for many years. Each week, his powerful, witty &lt;i&gt;Time Out&lt;/i&gt; covers became an essential part of London life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pearcemarchbank.com/pearcemarchbankb.html|title=Pearce Marchbank - Biography|author=|date=|website=www.pearcemarchbank.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027062056/http://pearcemarchbank.com/pearcemarchbankb.html|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Elliott launched ''Time Out New York'' (''TONY''), his North American magazine debut, in 1995. The magazine procured young and upcoming talent to provide cultural reviews for young New Yorkers at the time.&lt;ref name = adweek/&gt; The success of ''TONY'' led to the introduction of ''Time Out New York Kids'', a quarterly magazine aimed at families. The expansion continued with Elliott licensing the Time Out brand worldwide spreading the magazine to 39 cities including Istanbul, Dubai, Beijing, Hong Kong and Lisbon.&lt;ref name = adweek/&gt;

Additional Time Out products included travel magazines, city guides, and books.&lt;ref name = adweek/&gt; In 2010, Time Out became the official publisher of travel guides and tourist books for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/carlton-wiley-and-time-out-official-publishers-london-olympics| title=Carlton, Wiley and Time Out official publishers for London Olympics| author=Catherine Neilan| date=17 March 2010| publisher=The Bookseller| accessdate=16 June 2015| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085417/http://www.thebookseller.com/news/carlton-wiley-and-time-out-official-publishers-london-olympics| archivedate=4 March 2016| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time Out''{{’}}s need to expand to digital platforms led to Elliott, sole owner of the group until November 2010, to sell half of ''Time Out'' London and 66 percent of ''TONY'' to private equity group Oakley Capital, valuing the company at £20million.&lt;ref name=bbc20101126&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11844925|title=Time Out publisher sells 50% stake|publisher=BBC News|date=26 November 2010|accessdate=26 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127044834/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11844925|archivedate=27 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group, founded by [[Peter Dubens]], was owned by Tony Elliott and Oakley Capital until 2016, the agreement provided capital for investment to expand the brand.

'''''Total Resistance''''', originally published in German as ''Der totale Widerstand: Eine Kleinkriegsanleitung für Jedermann'' ("Total Resistance: A Guerrilla Warfare Manual for Everyone") is a [[guerilla warfare]] manual.

It was written in 1957 by the Swiss army officer [[Hans von Dach]] to prepare the Swiss population for an occupation of Switzerland by [[Warsaw Pact]] forces, an eventuality then considered possible in the context of the [[Cold War]]. The book has been republished as pirated translations in dozens of languages in numerous countries abroad, and notably found use by left-wing terror groups in the 1960s and 70s.&lt;ref name="NZZ 26 July 2013"&gt;{{cite news|page=12|last=Tribelhorn|first=Marc|title=Terror-Rezepte aus der Schweiz: Über die erstaunliche "Karriere" eines Guerilla-Handbuchs, das einiges über die Eidgenossenschaft im Kalten Krieg erzählt|url=http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/schweiz/terror-rezepte-fuer-guerilleros-1.18123000|accessdate=26 July 2013|newspaper=[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]|date=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
''Der totale Widerstand'' was first published in 1957 in seven volumes by the Swiss Non-Commissioned Officers' Association  (''Schweizer Unteroffiziersverband'', SUOV) with an intent of broad dissemination to the Swiss population. The book was a commercial success, being reprinted five times and selling in the tens of thousands, notably in West Germany and Austria. It became by far the most well-known of von Dach's more than a hundred works on military tactics.&lt;ref name="NZZ 26 July 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPR 1/2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mantovani|first=Mauro|title=Der "Volksaufstand": Vorstellungen und Vorbereitungen der Schweiz im 19. und 20.

==Contents==
The book is a manual for [[irregular warfare]] against an occupying force, intended to be used by civilians rather than by soldiers. It presumes a form of irregular resistance involving no arms heavier than light infantry arms: rifles, hand grenades and mines.

The topics covered in the first volume include:&lt;ref name="NZZ 26 July 2013" /&gt;
*the operative, tactical, technical and psychological basics of guerrilla warfare, such as sabotage, assassination and conduct under torture, 
*the establishment, organization and command of guerrilla warfare units and civilian resistance movements,
*enemy methods of suppressing and combating guerrilla warfare.

The other volumes describe the manufacture and use of basic weapons: chemical weapons (vol. 2), the ''Partisan'' 9mm submachine gun (vol. 3), the ''TARN'' pistol (vol. 4), [[improvised explosive devices]] (vol. 5), the ''TELL'' noise suppressor (vol. 6) and hand grenades (vol. 7).&lt;ref name="MPR 1/2012" /&gt;

==Reception==

===In Switzerland===
While popular in the militia officer corps, the book was not well received by senior Army leaders, who favored a defence policy based on conventional combined-arms and mechanized warfare rather than irregular warfare. In 1974, the Chief of the General Staff vetoed the publication of ''Total Resistance'' as an army manual, partly because of concerns that it advocated conduct that violated the [[laws of war]]. When the Swiss Army did establish a secret [[stay-behind]] organization, [[Projekt-26|P-26]], in the 1970s, it was conceived as a top-down, cadre-led structure rather than the broad, decentralized civilian resistance movement envisioned by von Dach.&lt;ref name="NZZ 26 July 2013" /&gt;

Nonetheless, the book remains part of the curriculum of the Swiss Army Military Academy at the [[ETH Zurich]] as one of the "classics of the history of strategy and the theory of war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mantovani|first=Mauro|title=Klassiker der Strategiegeschichte und der Kriegstheorie: Quellensammlung|url=http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/de/home/schweizerarmee/organisation/hkaneu/milak/militaerwissenschaftliche/strategische_studien/vorlesungsunterlagen.parsys.40643.DownloadFile.tmp/quellenstratstud2012.pdf|publisher=Militärakademie an der ETH Zürich / Dozentur Strategische Studien|accessdate=26 July 2013|date=January 2012}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abroad===
The book soon found unexpected success abroad. In 1965, U.S. special forces published an unauthorized translation entitled ''Total Resistance – Swiss Army Guide to Guerilla Warfare and Underground Operations''. Other pirated translations continued to be published in dozens of languages in countries ranging from Angola to Vietnam. In the Soviet Union, the book was derided as "nonsense" in a 1984 newspaper article.&lt;ref name="NZZ 26 July 2013" /&gt;

''Total Resistance'' became notably popular as an instruction manual for several left-wing terror groups active in the 1960s and 70s. According to Swiss and European police reports of the time, it was widely disseminated in left-wing extremist circles, and its tactics were used in bomb attacks in Southern Tyrol, New York and Frankfurt, as well as in unrests in Paris.&lt;ref name="NZZ 26 July 2013" /&gt;

In Germany, the book was often found in police searches, including with [[Red Army Faction]] members. Since 1988, ''Der totale Widerstand'' has been the only Swiss book whose distribution is restricted in Germany because it is indexed by the [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons]] as "conducive to confusing the social ethics of children and young people, and to promote their inclination to violence".&lt;ref name="NZZ 26 July 2013" /&gt;

The '''Tregwynt Hoard''' is a mid-17th century [[hoard]] of coins found at [[Tregwynt Mansion]] near [[Fishguard]] in  [[Pembrokeshire]], [[Wales]], in 1996. The hoard is now in [[National Museum Wales]]. The treasure consisted of 33 gold coins, 467 silver coins and a gold ring.&lt;ref name=bm2/&gt; This was the first [[English Civil War]] hoard found in Pembrokeshire.&lt;ref name=mow/&gt;

==Local history==
This mansion had been the scene where the  invasion of the French was first reported to Colonel Thomas Knox who was at a dance there on 23 February 1797. Knox, who had been appointed by his father William Knox went into a strategic withdrawal to [[Haverfordwest]] which is in land. The retreat of the ''Fishguard Fencibles'' was halted by Lord Cawdor who persuaded Knox to advance. The ''Fencibles'' who were local volunteers saw off the force of 1200 French convicts. It was reported the local population assisted in seeing off the "last invasion of British soil". The [[BBC]] reported that there was a local story that the guests at the dance hid their valuables and that when a hoard was discovered it was thought initially to have confirmed the tale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/6949422.stm Civil War coin hoard 'goes home'], BBC, 17 August 2007, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==The hoard==
The hoard can be dated from the date of the last coin that was included in the hoard and this came from 1647 or 1648. This date is at the end of English Civil War and these troubles are the probable reason for the hoard being deposited. There are over 200 hoards that date from the time of the civil war. This was the first civil war hoard found in Pembrokeshire.&lt;ref name=mow/&gt; These goods were hidden by an outbuilding of the Tregwynt Mansion. They were discovered in 1996 as a result of building work resulting from the construction of a tennis court. Because a few coins had been found, the ground was searched by a metal detector and Roy Lewis discovered many more coins. By the end, a [[J. C. Bamford|JCB digger]] was involved and in addition to the coins they also found lead sheeting which is thought to have covered the hoard and a ring with a motto inside it. The inscription reads ''"Better death than false of faith"'' (spelling updated).&lt;ref name=mow&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/1908/ Tregwynt Hoard], Museum of Wales, retrieved July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The hoard was probably hidden at the time that [[Oliver Cromwell]] came to Pembrokeshire to settle the local Royalists who were in rebellion. The value at the time was over 50 pounds and this would have been over four years wages for an average soldier. The money may have been saved by Llewellin Harries who lived at the mansion at the time with his twelve children.&lt;ref name=bm2/&gt;

==Artefacts==
The treasure consisted of 33 gold coins, 467 silver coins and a gold [[Posie ring]].&lt;ref name=bm2&gt;{{Cite web | title=The Tregwynt Hoard | publisher=[[British Museum]] | url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/loan_in/t/the_tregwynt_hoard.aspx | accessdate=2010-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the coins were:
*The latest coin is a 1647 or 1648 shilling bearing a sceptre
*A Scottish 1602 coin of [[James VI of Scotland]]
*A [[Charles I of England]] one pound gold coin
*A Charles I silver half-crown struck at an emergency mint in Shrewsbury in 1642&lt;ref name=mow/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2940">'''Trenchardism''' describes the domestic and foreign policies associated in Britain with Air Marshal [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Hugh Trenchard]] in successive roles as [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]] from 1919&amp;ndash;30 and [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Head of the Metropolitan Police]] from 1931&amp;ndash;35.

==Doctrine of Air Supremacy==

Trenchard was a keen advocate of British airpower. A key figure in the development of the [[Royal Air Force]], Trenchard advocated the use of aircraft to destroy an enemy's war making capacity, a view influential in developing Britain's [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing of Germany]] during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smart|first=Nick|title=British Strategy and Politics During the Phony War: Before the Balloon Went Up|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2alsusMfcK8C&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=trenchardism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oO1Ir4XYhF&amp;sig=mNijzP6rhV9QjzYyvHFWxz2lQGI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MiJeUMSJPInS0QXR9YH4Bg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=trenchardism&amp;f=false|work=Google Books|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Trenchard also advocated a system of 'air control' to maintain order in [[British Empire|Britain's colonial empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deer|first=Patrick|title=Culture in Camouflage: War, Empire and Modern British Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujOyRFt-wTwC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=trenchardism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wDJLrs1Ywk&amp;sig=LMoWZScrBhzbTbG97yL6VWHk7HM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MiJeUMSJPInS0QXR9YH4Bg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=trenchardism&amp;f=false|work=Google Books|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trenchardism in domestic policy==

Campaigners on the Left in Britain resented what they deemed Trenchard's militarisation of policing in London and saw innovations such as the [[Hendon Police College|Metropolitan Police College]] not as the professionalisation Trenchard claimed but a deliberate assault on Britain's traditional style of consensus policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Answer the Fascist challenge|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/topics/hyde-park.htm|work=MEPO 2/3074|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This view of Trenchardism as an authoritarian doctrine was exacerbated by specific police tactics used against hunger marchers in London, including use of batons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hunger March speeches|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/topics/marchers.htm|work=HO 144/18186|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1112">The '''University of Reading Herbarium''' (RNG) is a [[herbarium]] on the [[University of Reading]]'s [[Whiteknights Park|Whiteknights Campus]]. 

Along with the Cole Museum, it forms part of the university's School of Biological Sciences, and is principally used for teaching and research purposes.  The herbarium has over 300,000 specimens from around the world but has its most extensive collections from the Euromediterranean area, supplemented with special collections from the Falkland Islands and southern South America.  The herbarium provides a research resource for some 50 staff and 500 students in Biological Sciences as well as providing material via loans to other registered herbaria.

== History ==
RNG was formed from the herbaria of the university's departments of Botany and Agricultural Botany, and was founded in the early 1900s.

'''ZipcodeZoo''' is a free, online encyclopedia intended to document all living [[species]] and [[infraspecies]] known to science. It is compiled from existing databases. It offers one page for each living species, supplementing text with video, sound, and images where available.

ZipcodeZoo is an online [[database]] that collects the [[natural history]], [[Biological classification|classification]], [[species]] characteristics, [[conservation biology]], and [[Range (biology)|distribution]] [[information]] of thousands of species and [[infraspecies]].  It includes over 800,000 [[photographs]], 50,000 [[video]]s, 160,000 [[media clip|sound clip]]s, and 3.2 million [[map]]s describing nearly 3.2 million species and infraspecies.

The site and its sister site lookup.life include a number of specialized search functions, such as identifying a bird species from its color, shape and other traits, including where it was seen; or generating a list of plants or animals likely to be found in or near a specific location (a zipcode, state, country, latitude/longitude, etc.). The searches can be restricted to specific taxa, or broad categories like reptiles or fish. A sound trainer can play multiple bird song recordings simultaneously.

ZipcodeZoo draws on the [[Catalogue of Life]] for its basic species list, the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]] for its maps, [[Flickr]] for many of its photos, [[YouTube]] for videos, [[Xeno-canto]] for some of its sound recordings, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] for conservation status, and other major sources.&lt;ref&gt;such as the [http://taxonomicon.taxonomy.nl/ Taxonomicon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824160507/http://taxonomicon.taxonomy.nl/ |date=August 24, 2009 }} for taxonomic information.&lt;/ref&gt;
