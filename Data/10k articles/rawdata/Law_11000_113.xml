}}{{italic title|all=yes|noerror}}'''''Amchem Products Inc v British Columbia (Workers' Compensation Board)''''', [1993] 1 S.C.R. 897 is a leading decision on ''[[forum non conveniens]]'' by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. The Court overturned an [[anti-suit injunction]] issued by the [[British Columbia Supreme Court]] against the courts in Texas on the basis that the British Columbia (BC) court was not necessarily the better forum for the case.

==Background==
A number of BC residents began an action against several US manufacturers of [[asbestos]] in Texas. The Texas court accepted jurisdiction over the matter and heard the case. The manufacturers applied to the BC Supreme Court to issue an anti-suit injunction, arguing that the proper forum for the plaintiffs would be in BC and not Texas.

The BC Supreme Court issued the injunction. In response, Texas issued an "anti-anti-suit injunction". The BC Supreme Court judgment was upheld on appeal to the BC Court of Appeal.

==Ruling of the Court==
The Supreme Court of Canada overturned the judgment and found that there was insufficient grounds to deny Texas jurisdiction.

The Court adopts the test for ''forum non conveniens'' from ''[[Spiliada Maritime Corp. v. Cansulex Ltd.]]'', [1987] A.C. 460

'''''Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd''''',&lt;ref name="Baxter"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|38|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |date=29 August 2007 ||parralelcite=(2007)&amp;nbsp;232&amp;nbsp;[[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Baxter'') was a decision of the [[High Court of Australia]], which ruled on 29 August 2007 that Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited, a [[tendering|tenderer]] for various government contracts, was bound by the ''[[Trade Practices Act 1974]]'' (TPA, Australian legislation governing anti-competitive behaviour) in its trade and commerce in tendering for government contracts. More generally, the case concerned the principles of derivative [[Crown immunity|governmental immunity]]:&lt;ref&gt;There are differing opinions whether the immunity in Australia should be referred to as "Crown immunity" or "governmental immunity". For example, {{Harvnb|Wright|2008}} refers to governmental immunity; while {{Harvnb|Seddon|2009}} refers to Crown immunity. Without judging the merits of which term is more appropriate, this article uses "governmental immunity"&lt;/ref&gt; whether the immunity of a government from a statute extends to third parties that conduct business with the government.

The High Court's judgment marked a successful appeal for the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]], the Australian regulator of anti-competitive conduct, having lost at first instance and on appeal in the [[Federal Court of Australia]]. The ACCC was again successful when the case was remitted to the Federal Court for reconsideration, ending eight years of litigation between the parties. The High Court's judgment was received as a significant precedent in the law of derivative governmental immunity in Australia.

==Background==

===Facts===
Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited (Baxter), was the Australian subsidiary of the multinational health care company [[Baxter International]]. Baxter manufactured [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] (IV) and [[peritoneal dialysis]] (PD) fluids at various plants in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCA|581|2005|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[6]-[7] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the cost of importing sterile IV fluids and the absence of a rival domestic producer, Baxter was a monopoly supplier of sterile IV fluids in the Australian market. Its monopoly covered large volume parenteral fluids, irrigating solutions and [[Parenteral nutrition|parenteral nutrition fluids]]. However, Baxter faced competition in the market for [[peritoneal dialysis]] fluids (PD fluids).{{sfn|Duns|2008|p=51}}

A number of [[States and territories of Australia|state governments]] issued [[tendering|requests for tender]] for the supply of sterile fluids and PD fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|38|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[10]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Baxter responded to the requests with tenders that put forward two alternative pricing options: either a state could purchase sterile fluids and PD fluids as a bundled package at a discounted rate, or the state could buy each product separately but at a higher rate.{{sfn|Corones|2007|p=374}}

===Legislation===
Section&amp;nbsp;46 of the TPA prohibited corporations from misusing market power.&lt;ref name="TPA s46"&gt;''Trade Practices Act'' 1974 (Cth) {{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2010C00623/Html/Volume_1#param355 |title=s.46 Misuse of market power}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Section&amp;nbsp;47 prohibited [[exclusive dealing]].&lt;ref name="TPA s47"&gt;''Trade Practices Act'' 1974 (Cth) {{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2010C00623/Html/Volume_1#param358 |title=s.47 Exclusive dealing}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The critical provision to the case was Section&amp;nbsp;2B of the TPA. Section&amp;nbsp;2B provided that Sections&amp;nbsp;46 and 47 of the TPA:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... bind the Crown in right of each of the States, of the Northern Territory and of the Australian Capital Territory, so far as the Crown carries on a business, either directly or by an authority of the State or Territory ...&lt;ref name="TPA s2B"&gt;''Trade Practices Act'' 1974 (Cth) {{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2010C00623/Html/Volume_1#param4 |title=s.2B  Application of Act to States and Territories}} which provides that the Crown is bound by Part IV of the TPA, which includes Sections&amp;nbsp;46 and 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section&amp;nbsp;2B thus provided an immunity from state and territory governments from Sections&amp;nbsp;46 and 47 of the TPA insofar as the governments were not carrying on a business.

===The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission===
The [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC), the Australian government authority responsible for regulating the TPA, commenced an action in the [[Federal Court of Australia]] seeking declarations that Baxter's bundling pricing structure in its tenders had contravened [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare#Legislation|Sections&amp;nbsp;46 and 47]] of the TPA. The ACCC sought the imposition of injunctions and pecuniary penalties by the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCA|581|2005|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[1] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Derivative governmental immunity before ''Baxter''===
Derivative governmental immunity refers to the extension of a government's immunity from a statute to a non-government party on the basis the government would be affected if the statute was to apply to the other party.{{sfn|Wright|2008|p=116}}

Prior to ''Baxter'', the leading case on derivative governmental immunity in Australia was the 1979 High Court judgment in ''Bradken Consolidated Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|15|1979|litigants=Bradken Consolidated Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd |parallelcite=(1979) 145 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 107 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wright|2008|pp=116–120}}{{sfn|Heydon|1989|p=[2.115]}} In ''Bradken'', the High Court upheld a claim for derivative governmental immunity by equipment suppliers to the Queensland Commissioner for Railways. The majority's conclusion was that if the Queensland government was immune from the TPA, it would prejudice the Queensland government if the contracts and arrangements it entered were subject to the TPA through the other parties to the contracts and arrangements.{{sfn|Wright|2008|pp=116–117}}

''Bradken'''s application of the principle of derivative governmental immunity had been subject to criticism. Robertson Wright SC, a [[Senior Counsel]] specialising in competition and trade practices law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://12thfloor.com.au/robertson-wright.htm|title=Robertson Wright SC|publisher=Wentworth Selborne Chambers (12th floor)|accessdate=13 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112013720/http://www.12thfloor.com.au/robertson-wright.htm|archivedate=12 November 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued there are "a number of difficulties" with the judgment, including the "unsatisfactory nature" of the authorities it relied on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2008|p=117}}. Wright details his criticisms in {{citation|last=Wright|first=Robertson|year=2007|title=The future of Derivative Crown Immunity—with a competition law perspective|journal=Competition and Consumer Law Journal |publisher=Lexis Nexis Australia |location=Sydney |volume=14 |page=240 |issn=1039-5598 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court's judgment in ''Baxter'' would mark a retreat from ''Bradken''.{{sfn|Corones|2007|p=375}}

===Federal Court litigation===
The ACCC conceded that the state governments were not carrying on businesses in procuring the medical products. This meant that the governments were immune from Sections&amp;nbsp;46 and 47 of the TPA. Baxter argued that this immunity extended to itself, by claiming derivative governmental immunity.{{sfn|Seddon|2009|p=168}} On 16 May 2005, The [[Federal Court of Australia]] ([[James Allsop|Allsop J]] presiding) found in Baxter's favour at first instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCA|581|2005|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the court held that Baxter would have breached the TPA, governmental immunity under Section&amp;nbsp;2B extended to Baxter Healthcare.{{sfn|Corones|2007|p=374}} Allsop J's judgment was upheld unanimously on appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court (Justices [[John Mansfield (judge)|Mansfield]], [[John Dowsett|Dowsett]] and [[Roger Gyles|Gyles]] presiding).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCAFC|128|2006|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[1] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The full bench expressed unease about its own judgment, stating that the question of derivative governmental immunity should be left to the High Court for reconsideration of ''Bradken''.{{sfn|Wright|2008|p=122}}

==High Court appeal==
The ACCC was granted special leave to appeal to the High Court against the judgment of the full bench of the Federal Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCATrans|60|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |courtname=auto |date=9 February 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal was heard on 16 May 2007. The [[Australian Government Solicitor]] acted for the ACCC, with [[Lindsay Foster]] as [[Senior Counsel]]; [[Blake Dawson]] and [[David Yates (judge)|David Yates SC]] represented Baxter. In addition to Baxter, the states of Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales were respondents to the appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCATrans|202|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |courtname=auto |date=15 May 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court decided on 29 August 2007, by a 6–1 majority, to allow the ACCC's appeal and remit the matter back to the full bench of Federal Court for reconsideration. The majority held that Baxter was not covered by derivative governmental immunity in its dealings with the state governments.&lt;ref name="Baxter"/&gt;

===Judgments===

====Joint judgment====
Five judges ([[Chief Justice of Australia|Chief Justice]] [[Murray Gleeson|Gleeson]] and Justices [[William Gummow|Gummow]], [[Kenneth Hayne|Hayne]], [[Dyson Heydon|Heydon]] and [[Susan Crennan|Crennan]]) joined in the leading majority judgment allowing the ACCC's appeal. The joint judgment reasoned that Parliament could not have intended for corporations that do business with the government to be exempt from the restrictive trade practices provisions in Part&amp;nbsp;IV of the TPA in respect of that business. Emphasising the overall purpose of the TPA, the judges reasoned that the purpose would not be fulfilled if Baxter could claim derivative immunity.{{sfn|Seddon|2009|p=169}} In response to the concern that one party to a transaction (the government) would be immune from the TPA while the other party would be bound by it, the joint judgment reasoned there was "nothing unusual" about such an outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|38|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[44]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The joint judgment did not rule out derivative governmental immunity in all cases. In determining the scope of whether governmental immunity from a statutory provision extends to a party dealing with the government, the judgment adopted the following position of Justice [[Frank Kitto|Kitto]], then dissenting, in the 1955 High Court case of ''Wynyard Investments v Commissioner for Railways (NSW)'':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|72|1955|litigants=Wynyard Investments v Commissioner for Railways |date=15 December 1955 ||parallelcite=(1955)&amp;nbsp;93&amp;nbsp;[[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 376 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Corones|2007|p=376}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;The object in view is to ascertain whether the Crown has such an interest in that which would be interfered with if the provision in question were held to bind the corporation that the interference would be, for a legal reason, an interference with some right, interest, power, authority, privilege, immunity or purpose belonging or appertaining to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|72|1955|litigants=Wynyard Investments v Commissioner for Railways |pinpoint=[9] per Kitto J }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Wynyard Investments'' was a case about governmental immunity generally (not derivative governmental immunity specifically), but Justice Kitto's dissenting judgment extended to derivative governmental immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|72|1955|litigants=Wynyard Investments v Commissioner for Railways |pinpoint=[5] per Kitto J }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having examined the characteristics of the TPA as a law to promote competitive behaviour, the joint judgment held that the extension of derivative governmental immunity from the TPA to a trading corporation would be a "remarkable" conclusion and "far beyond what is necessary to protect the legal rights of governments, or to prevent a divesting of proprietary, contractual or other legal rights and interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|38|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[64]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kirby J====
[[Michael Kirby (judge)|Justice Kirby]]'s judgment agreed with the outcome of the joint judgment, for different reasons. Kirby criticised the concept of governmental immunity itself, stating that "persisting with [governmental immunity] into the twenty-first century is unacceptable."{{sfn|Duns|2008|pp=53–4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|38|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[97]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Callinan J====
[[Ian Callinan|Justice Callinan]] dissented from the majority, holding that derivative governmental immunity extended to Baxter. Callinan followed ''Bradken'', concluding that it remained authoritative.{{sfn|Duns|2008|pp=53–4}}

==Reaction to judgment==

===Significance===
Robertson Wright, writing after the judgment was handed down, claimed that ''Baxter'' represented a change to the law, drawing the following conclusions from the judgment:
* The application of derivative governmental immunity depends on a construction of the particular statute (particularly the object and purpose of the statute).
* As a general rule, derivative governmental immunity applies if the statute's coverage of a person would divest the government of proprietary, contractual, or other legal rights or interests (as opposed to commercial or policy rights or interests).{{sfn|Wright|2008|p=126}}

The judgment was reported in the press as a significant legal victory for the ACCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/business/back-to-the-trade-law-books-as-samuel-scores/2007/08/29/1188067191295.html|title=Back to the trade law books as Samuel scores|work = [[Brisbane Times]]|last=Maiden|first=Malcolm|date=29 August 2007|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judgment was also received as an "historic decision" setting a precedent for government procurement, on the basis that businesses might no longer be able to rely on immunity from the TPA when contracting with governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/businesses-could-lose-immunity-after-ruling/2007/08/29/1188067189790.html|title=Businesses could lose immunity after ruling|work =[[The Age]]|last=Murphy|first=Mathew|date=30 August 2007|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Nicholas Seddon, a lawyer and academic specialising in commercial and government law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blakedawson.com/Templates/Profiles/x_profile_content_page.aspx?id=8833|title=Nicholas Seddon: Special Counsel, Canberra|publisher=[[Blake Dawson]]|accessdate=13 January 2010}} At the time of writing his criticisms, Seddon was an employee of [[Blake Dawson]], the firm that represented Baxter throughout the Federal Court and High Court litigation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.anu.edu.au/scripts/StaffDetails.asp?StaffID=358|title=ANU College of Law: Our Staff|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|accessdate=13 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710032458/http://law.anu.edu.au/scripts/StaffDetails.asp?StaffID=358|archivedate=10 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed the High Court's judgment leaves "many uncertainties", particularly regarding whether derivative governmental immunity will extend to private sector providers carrying out governmental functions that have been contracted to them (as opposed to merely providing goods or services to the government).{{sfn|Seddon|2009|p=171}} Robertson Wright echoed these concerns, arguing the joint judgment did not "set out in as helpful detail" as it might the factors to be taken into account in deciding whether governmental immunity will derive to a party dealing with the government.{{sfn|Wright|2008|pp=126–127}} Seddon also criticised the outcome of the case itself, arguing it is "difficult to see how derivative immunity does not inevitably flow" from the governmental immunity from the TPA. He suggested that the application of the TPA to a party that deals with a government compromises the intention of Parliament that State and Territory governments should be immune from the TPA.{{sfn|Seddon|2009|p=170}}

==Later action==
The ACCC was successful, by a 2–1 majority, upon the remittal of the case to the full bench of the Federal Court. The full bench found that Baxter contravened Sections&amp;nbsp;46 and 47 of the TPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCAFC|141|2008|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |date=11 August 2008 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That judgment ended the eight-year-long litigation between Baxter and the ACCC. It was the first time in over 10 years that a corporation had unsuccessfully defended a prosecution brought by the ACCC for an alleged contravention of Section&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

{{Contract law}}
'''Breach of contract''' is a [[legal]] [[cause of action]] and a type of [[civil wrong]], in which a [[binding agreement]] or bargained-for exchange is not honored by one or more of the parties to the contract by non-performance or interference with the other party's performance. Breach occurs when a party to a contract fails to fulfill his or her obligation as described in the contract, or communicates an intent to fail the obligation or otherwise appears not to be able to perform his or her obligation under the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breach of Contract|url=http://thelawdictionary.org/breach-of-contract/|website=The Law Dictionary|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minor breaches==
In a "minor" breach (a partial breach or immaterial breach or where there has been substantial performance), the non-breaching party cannot sue for [[specific performance]], and can only sue for actual [[damages]].

Suppose a homeowner hires a contractor to install new plumbing and insists that the pipes, which will ultimately be hidden behind the walls, must be red. The contractor instead uses blue pipes that function just as well. Although the contractor breached the literal terms of the [[contract]], the homeowner cannot ask a court to order the contractor to replace the blue pipes with red pipes. The homeowner can only recover the amount of his or her actual damages. In this instance, this is the difference in value between red pipe and blue pipe. Since the color of a pipe does not affect its function, the difference in value is zero. Therefore, no damages have been incurred and the homeowner would receive nothing (see ''[[Jacob &amp; Youngs v. Kent]]''.)

However, had the pipe colour been specified in the agreement as a ''[[covenant (law)|condition]]'', a breach of that condition would constitute a "major" breach. For example, when a contract specifies [[time is of the essence]] and one party to the contract fails to meet a contractual obligation in a timely fashion, the other party could sue for damages for a major breach.

==Material breach==
A ''material breach'' is any failure to perform that permits the other party to the contract to either compel performance, or collect damages because of the breach. A breach of contract will constitute a material breach if the term of the contract that has been breached is a '''condition'''. A term is a condition if it satisfies the test of essentiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWStRp|37|1938|litigants=Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd v Luna Park |parallelcite=(1938) 38 [[State Reports New South Wales|SR (NSW)]] 632 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The test of essentiality requires that the promise (term) was of such importance to the promisee that he or she would not have entered into the contract unless he had been assured of strict or substantial performance of the promise and this ought to have been apparent to the promisor. This is an objective test of the parties' intention at the time of formation of the contract. 

If the contractor in the above example had been instructed to use copper pipes, and instead used iron pipes that would not last as long as the copper pipes would have lasted, the homeowner can recover the cost of actually correcting the breach – taking out the iron pipes and replacing them with copper pipes.

There are exceptions to this. Legal scholars and courts often state that the owner of a house whose pipes are not the specified grade or quality (a typical hypothetical example) cannot recover the cost of replacing the pipes for the following reasons:

# '''Economic waste'''. The law does not favor tearing down or destroying something that is valuable (almost anything with value is "valuable"). In this case, significant destruction of the house would be required to completely replace the pipes, and so the law is hesitant to enforce damages of that nature. See ''[[Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal &amp; Mining Co.]]''.
# '''Pricing in'''. In most cases of breach, a party to the contract simply fails to perform one or more terms. In those cases, the breaching party should have already considered the cost to perform those terms and thus "keeps" that cost when they do not perform. That party should not be entitled to keep those savings. However, in the pipe example the contractor never considered the cost of tearing down a house to fix the pipes, and so it is not reasonable to expect them to pay damages of that nature.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Most homeowners would be unable to collect damages that compensate them for replacing the pipes, but rather would be awarded damages that compensate them for the ''loss of value'' in the house. For example, say the house is worth $125,000 with copper and $120,000 with iron pipes. The homeowner would be able to collect the $5,000 difference, and nothing more.


In the United States, the [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]] lists the following criteria to determine whether a specific failure constitutes a material breach:&lt;ref&gt;[[American Law Institute]], Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 241 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In determining whether a failure to render or to offer performance is material, the following circumstances are significant:

:(a) the extent to which the injured party will be deprived of the benefit which he reasonably expected;
:(b) the extent to which the injured party can be adequately [[payment|compensated]] for the part of that benefit of which he will be deprived;
:(c) the extent to which the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will suffer forfeiture;
:(d) the likelihood that the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will cure his failure, taking account of all the circumstances including any reasonable assurances;
:(e) the extent to which the behavior of the party failing to perform or to offer to perform comports with standards of good faith and fair dealing.}}

==Fundamental breach==
A ''[[fundamental breach]]'' (or ''repudiatory breach'') is a breach so fundamental that it permits the aggrieved party to terminate performance of the contract. In addition, that party is entitled to [[lawsuit|sue]] for damages.

==Anticipatory breach==
A ''breach by [[anticipatory repudiation]]'' (or simply ''anticipatory breach'') is an unequivocal indication that the party will not perform when performance is due, or a situation in which future non-performance is inevitable. An anticipatory breach gives the non-breaching party the option to treat such a breach as immediate, and, if repudiatory, to terminate the contract and sue for damages (without waiting for the breach to actually take place).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|14|1985|litigants=Progressive Mailing House v Tabali Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1985) 157 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 17 at p. 48 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|51|1989|litigants=Foran v Wight |parallelcite=(1989) 168 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 385 at pp 416, 441-2 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, A contracts with B on January 1 to sell 500 quintals of wheat and to deliver it on May 1. Subsequently, on April 15, A writes to B and says that he will not deliver the wheat. B may immediately consider the breach to have occurred and file a suit for damages for the scheduled performance, even though A has until May 1 to perform. However, a unique feature of anticipatory breach is that if an aggrieved party chooses not to accept a repudiation occurring before the time set for performance, not only will the contract continue on foot, but also there will be no right to damages unless and until an actual breach occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paterson|first1=Jeannie|last2=Robertson|first2=Andrew|last3=Duke|first3=Arlen|title=Principles of Contract Law|date=2012|publisher=Thomson Reuters (Professional) Australia Limited|location=Sydney|page=440|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40105">'''Content-control software''', commonly referred to as an '''internet filter''', is [[software]] that restricts or controls the content an Internet user is capable to access, especially when utilised to restrict material delivered over the [[Internet]] via the [[World Wide Web|Web]], [[e-mail]], or other means. Content-control software determines what content will be available or be blocked.

Such restrictions can be applied at various levels: a government can attempt to apply them nationwide (see [[Internet censorship]]), or they can, for example, be applied by an [[ISP]] to its clients, by an employer to its personnel, by a school to its students, by a library to its visitors, by a parent to a child's computer, or by an [[self-censorship|individual user to their own computer]].

The motive is often to prevent access to content which the computer's owner(s) or other authorities may consider objectionable. When imposed without the consent of the user, content control can be characterised as a form of internet censorship. Some content-control software includes time control functions that empowers parents to set the amount of time that child may spend accessing the Internet or playing games or other computer activities.

In some countries, such software is ubiquitous. [[Censorship in Cuba#Internet|In Cuba]], if a computer user at a government-controlled [[Internet cafe]] types certain words, the word processor or browser is automatically closed, and a "state security" warning is given.&lt;ref name="cubaonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsf.org/sites/default/files/rapport_gb_md_1.pdf|title=Going online in Cuba: Internet under surveillance|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The term "content control" is used on occasion by [[CNN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/04/27/eyeonchina.internet/ |title=Young, angry ... and wired - May 3, 2005 |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=3 May 2005 |accessdate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.multichannel.com/policy/playboy-preaches-control/12883 |title=Playboy Preaches Control |first=R.

"Nannyware" has also been used in both product marketing and by the media. Industry research company [[Gartner]] uses "secure web gateway" (SWG) to describe the market segment.&lt;ref name="Gartner"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/secure-web-gateway/ |title=IT Glossary: Secure Web Gateway |publisher=[[Gartner]] |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies that make products that selectively block Web sites do not refer to these products as censorware, and prefer terms such as "Internet filter" or "URL Filter"; in the specialized case of software specifically designed to allow parents to monitor and restrict the access of their children, "parental control software" is also used. Some products log all sites that a user accesses and rates them based on content type for reporting to an "accountability partner" of the person's choosing, and the term [[accountability software]] is used. Internet filters, parental control software, and/or accountability software may also be combined into one product.

Those critical of such software, however, use the term "censorware" freely: consider the Censorware Project, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://censorware.net/ |title=Censorware Project |publisher=censorware.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620042654/http://www.censorware.net/ |archivedate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term "censorware" in editorials criticizing makers of such software is widespread and covers many different varieties and applications: [[Xeni Jardin]] used the term in a 9 March 2006 editorial in ''The New York Times'' when discussing the use of American-made filtering software to suppress content in China; in the same month a high school student used the term to discuss the deployment of such software in his school district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://159.54.226.83/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060319/COLUMN0203/603190309/1064 |title=159.54.226.83/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060319/COLUMN0203/603190309/1064 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019020114/http://159.54.226.83/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20060319%2FCOLUMN0203%2F603190309%2F1064 |archivedate=19 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sethf.com/anticensorware/hearing_dc.php |title=DMCA 1201 Exemption Transcript, April 11 - Censorware |publisher=Sethf.com |date=11 April 2003 |accessdate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, outside of editorial pages as described above, traditional newspapers do not use the term "censorware" in their reporting, preferring instead to use less overtly controversial terms such as "content filter", "content control", or "web filtering"; ''The New York Times'' and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' both appear to follow this practice. On the other hand, Web-based newspapers such as [[CNET]] use the term in both editorial and journalistic contexts, for example "Windows Live to Get Censorware."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techbeta.org/news/windows-live-to-get-censorware/ |title=Windows Live to get censorware - ZDNet.co.uk |publisher=News.zdnet.co.uk |date=14 March 2006 |accessdate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of filtering==
Filters can be implemented in many different ways: by software on a personal computer, via network infrastructure such as [[proxy server]]s, [[Domain Name System|DNS]] servers, or [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]]s that provide Internet access. No solution provides complete coverage, so most companies deploy a mix of technologies to achieve the proper content control inline with their policies.

;Browser based filters
: Browser based content filtering solution is the most lightweight solution to do the content filtering, and is implemented via a third party [[browser extension]].

;E-mail filters
: E-mail filters act on information contained in the mail body, in the mail headers such as sender and subject, and e-mail attachments to classify, accept, or reject messages. [[Bayesian spam filtering|Bayesian filters]], a type of statistical filter, are commonly used. Both client and server based filters are available.

;Client-side filters
:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/netsafekids/pro_fm_filter.html |title=Client-side filters |work=NetSafekids |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |year=2003 |accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of filter is installed as software on each computer where filtering is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Protecting-your-kids-with-Family-Safety|title=Protecting Your Kids with Family Safety|date=|accessdate=10 July 2012|publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This filter can typically be managed, disabled or uninstalled by anyone who has administrator-level privileges on the system.

;Content-limited (or filtered) ISPs
:Content-limited (or filtered) ISPs are Internet service providers that offer access to only a set portion of Internet content on an opt-in or a mandatory basis. Anyone who subscribes to this type of service is subject to restrictions. The type of filters can be used to implement government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pam2011.gatech.edu/papers/pam2011--Xu.pdf|format=pdf|title=Internet Censorship in China: Where Does the Filtering Occur?|first=Xueyang|last=Xu|first2=Z.

;Network-based filtering
:This type of filter is implemented at the [[transport layer]] as a [[transparent proxy]], or at the [[application layer]] as a [[proxy server|web proxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.websense.com/content/support/library/web/v75/wcg_deploy/WCG_Deploy.1.3.aspx|title=Explicit and Transparent Proxy Deployments|publisher=Websense|accessdate=30 March 2012|year=2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418150020/http://www.websense.com/content/support/library/web/v75/wcg_deploy/WCG_Deploy.1.3.aspx|archivedate=18 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Filtering software may include [[data loss prevention software|data loss prevention]] functionality to filter outbound as well as inbound information.  All users are subject to the access policy defined by the institution.  The filtering can be customized, so a school district's high school library can have a different filtering profile than the district's junior high school library.

;DNS-based filtering
:This type of filtering is implemented at the DNS layer and attempts to prevent lookups for domains that do not fit within a set of policies (either parental control or company rules). Multiple free [[Public_recursive_name_server|public DNS services]] offer filtering options as part of their services.

;Search-engine filters
:Many search engines, such as Google and Bing offer users the option of turning on a safety filter. When this safety filter is activated, it filters out the inappropriate links from all of the search results. If users know the actual URL of a website that features explicit or adult content, they have the ability to access that content without using a search engine. Some providers offer child-oriented versions of their engines that permit only children friendly websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/netsafekids/pro_fm_filter.html |title=Filtering |work=NetSafekids |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |year=2003 |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for filtering==
{{main article|Internet censorship}}
[[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) that block material containing [[pornography]], or controversial religious, political, or news-related content en route are often utilized by parents who do not permit their children to access content not conforming to [[indoctrination|their personal beliefs]]. Content filtering software can, however, also be used to block [[malware]] and other content that is or contains hostile, intrusive, or annoying material including [[adware]], [[Spam (electronic)|spam]], [[computer virus]]es, [[computer worm|worms]], [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan horses]], and [[spyware]].

Most content control software is marketed to organizations or parents. It is, however, also marketed on occasion to facilitate self-censorship, for example by people struggling with addictions to [[online pornography]], gambling, chat rooms, etc. Self-censorship software may also be utilised by some in order to avoid viewing content they consider immoral, inappropriate, or simply distracting.  A number of [[accountability software]] products are marketed as ''self-censorship'' or ''accountability software''. These are often promoted by religious media and at [[place of worship|religious gatherings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanministry.org/wiki/accountability-software |title=Accountability Software: Accountability and Monitoring Software Reviews |work=TechMission, Safe Families |publisher=UrbanMinistry.org |date= |accessdate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

===Filtering errors===

==== Overblocking ====
Utilising a filter that is overly zealous at filtering content, or mislabels content not intended to be censored can result in over blocking, or over-censoring. Over blocking can filter out material that should be acceptable under the filtering policy in effect, for example health related information may unintentionally be filtered along with porn-related material because of the [[Scunthorpe problem]].  Filter administrators may prefer to err on the side of caution by accepting over blocking to prevent any risk of access to sites that they determine to be undesirable.  Content-control software was mentioned as blocking access to Beaver College before its name change to [[Arcadia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/03/01/2230240&amp;tid=146 |title=Web Censors Prompt College To Consider Name Change  |publisher=Slashdot |date=2 March 2000 |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example was the filtering of [[Horniman Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/10/08/horniman_museum_filtered/ |title=Porn filters have a field day on Horniman Museum |author=Lester Haines |date=8 October 2004 |newspaper=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, over-blocking may encourage users to bypass the filter entirely.

==== Underblocking ====
Whenever new information is uploaded to the Internet, filters can under block, or under-censor, content if the parties responsible for maintaining the filters do not update them quickly and accurately, and a blacklisting rather than a whitelisting filtering policy is in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/filter07.pdf |title=The Effectiveness of Internet Content Filters |first=Philip B. |last=Stark |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |date=10 November 2007 |accessdate=22 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morality and opinion===
Many&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/340550/microsoft_google_yahoo_speak_isp_filter_consultation/?fp=16&amp;fpid=1 |title=Microsoft, Google and Yahoo! speak out in ISP filter consultation
 |first=Spandas |last=Lui |date=23 March 2010 |publisher=arnnet.com |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; would disapprove of government filtering viewpoints on moral or political issues, agreeing that this could become support for [[propaganda]]. Many&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8517829.stm | work=BBC News | title=Google and Yahoo raise doubts over planned net filters | date=16 February 2010 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; would also find it unacceptable that an ISP, whether by law or by the ISP's own choice, should deploy such software without allowing the users to disable the filtering for their own connections. In the United States, the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] has been cited in calls to criminalise forced internet censorship. (See [[Content-control software#Legal actions|section below]])

Without adequate governmental supervision, content-filtering software could enable private companies to censor as they please. (See [[#Religious or political censorship|Religious or political censorship]], below). Government utilisation or encouragement of content-control software is a component of [[Internet Censorship]] (not to be confused with [[Computer and network surveillance|Internet Surveillance]], in which content is monitored and not necessarily restricted). The governments of countries such as [[Internet Censorship in China|the People's Republic of China]], and [[Internet censorship in Cuba|Cuba]] are current examples of countries in which this ethically controversial activity is alleged to have taken place.

===Legal actions===
In 1998, a United States federal district court in Virginia ruled ([[Loudoun v. Board of Trustees of the Loudoun County Library]]) that the imposition of mandatory filtering in a public library violates the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomwbell.com/NetLaw/Ch04/Loudoun.html |title=Mainstream Loudon v. Board of Trustees of the Loudon County Library, 24 F. Supp. 2d 552 (E.D. Va. 1998) |publisher=Tomwbell.com |date= |accessdate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the US Congress passed the [[Communications Decency Act]], banning indecency on the Internet. Civil liberties groups challenged the law under the First Amendment, and in 1997 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in their favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/521/844/case.html |title=Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union - 521 U.S. 844 (1997) |work=U.S. Reports |date=26 June 1997 |publisher=Justia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the civil liberties argument, especially from groups like the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], was that parents who wanted to block sites could use their own content-filtering software, making government involvement unnecessary.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In the late 1990s, groups such as the Censorware Project began reverse-engineering the content-control software and decrypting the blacklists to determine what kind of sites the software blocked. This led to legal action alleging violation of the "Cyber Patrol" [[EULA|license agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/Microsystems_v_Scandinavia_Online/?f=20000316_verif_complaint.html |title=Microsystems v Scandinavia Online, Verified Complaint |work=Civil No. 00CV10488, United States District Court, District of Massachusetts |author=Attorneys for Microsystems Software, Inc. and Mattel, Inc. |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |date=15 March 2000 |accessdate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered that such tools routinely blocked unobjectionable sites while also failing to block intended targets. (See [[#Over-zealous filtering|Over-zealous filtering]], below).

Some content-control software companies responded by claiming that their filtering criteria were backed by intensive manual checking. The companies' opponents argued, on the other hand, that performing the necessary checking would require resources greater than the companies possessed and that therefore their claims were not valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/itas/whitepaper_1.html |title=Electronic Frontier Foundation White Paper 1 for NRC project on Tools and Strategies for Protecting Kids from Pornography and Their Applicability to Other Inappropriate Internet Content |author1=Seth Finkelstein |author2=Lee Tien |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060419190143/http://www7.nationalacademies.org/itas/whitepaper_1.html |archivedate=19 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Motion Picture Association]] successfully obtained a UK ruling enforcing ISPs to use content-control software to prevent [[copyright infringement]] by their subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sky, Virgin Media Asked to Block Piracy Site Newzbin2|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15653434 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=9 November 2011  |accessdate=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious, anti-religious, and political censorship ===
Many types of content-control software have been shown to block sites based on the religious and political leanings of the company owners. Examples include blocking several religious sites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kelly Wilson |url=http://hometown.aol.com/Mjolnir13/test.htm |title=Hometown Has Been Shutdown - People Connection Blog: AIM Community Network |publisher=Hometown.aol.com |date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~Trifold/NOTICE.html |title=Notice!! |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; (including the Web site of the Vatican), many political sites, and homosexuality-related sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glaad.org/media/archive_detail.php?id=103&amp; |title=www.glaad.org/media/archive_detail.php?id=103&amp; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607224912/http://www.glaad.org/media/archive_detail.php?id=103&amp; |archivedate=June 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''X-Stop'' was shown to block sites such as the [[Quaker Oats Company|Quaker]] web site, the [[National Journal of Sexual Orientation Law]], [[The Heritage Foundation]], and parts of [[The Ethical Spectacle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectacle.org/cs/burt.html |title=The Mind of a Censor |publisher=Spectacle.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; CYBERsitter blocks out sites like [[National Organization for Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectacle.org/alert/peace.html |title=CYBERsitter: Where do we not want you to go today? |publisher=Spectacle.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Willard, an academic researcher and attorney, pointed out that many U.S. public schools and libraries use the same filtering software that many Christian organizations use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csriu.org/onlinedocs/documents/religious2.html |title=See: Filtering Software: The Religious Connection |publisher=Csriu.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyber Patrol, a product developed by The Anti-Defamation League and Mattel's The Learning Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/presrele/mise_00/3081-00.asp |title=See: ADL and The Learning Company Develop Educational Software |publisher=adl.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been found to block not only political sites it deems to be engaging in 'hate speech' but also human rights web sites, such as Amnesty International's web page about Israel and gay-rights web sites, such as glaad.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacefire.org/censorware/Cyber_Patrol/ |title=See: Cyber Patrol Examined |publisher=peacefire.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content labeling==
Content labeling may be considered another form of content-control software. In 1994, the [[Internet Content Rating Association]] (ICRA) &amp;mdash; now part of the [[Family Online Safety Institute]] &amp;mdash; developed a content rating system for online content providers. Using an online questionnaire a webmaster describes the nature of their web content. A small file is generated that contains a condensed, computer readable digest of this description that can then be used by content filtering software to block or allow that site.

ICRA labels come in a variety of formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fosi.org/icra/#tech |title=ICRA: Technical standards used |accessdate=2008-07-04 |work= |publisher=FOSI |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the World Wide Web Consortium's [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF) as well as [[Platform for Internet Content Selection]] (PICS) labels used by [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]] Content Advisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie6/using/howto/security/contentadv/config.mspx |title=Browse the Web with Internet Explorer 6 and Content Advisor |accessdate= |work= |publisher=Microsoft |date=March 26, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICRA labels are an example of self-labeling. Similarly, in 2006 the [[Association of Sites Advocating Child Protection (ASACP)]] initiated the Restricted to Adults self-labeling initiative. ASACP members were concerned that various forms of legislation being proposed in the [[United States]] were going to have the effect of forcing adult companies to label their content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asacp.org/page.php?content=news&amp;item=511 |title=ASACP Participates in Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography  |accessdate=2008-07-04 |work= |publisher= |date=November 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RTA label, unlike ICRA labels, does not require a webmaster to fill out a questionnaire or sign up to use. Like ICRA the RTA label is free. Both labels are recognized by a [[List of Content Control Software|wide variety of content-control software]].

The [[Voluntary Content Rating]] (VCR) system was devised by [[Solid Oak Software]] for their [[CYBERsitter]] filtering software, as an alternative to the PICS system, which some critics deemed too complex. It employs [[HTML]] [[meta element|metadata]] tags embedded within web page documents to specify the type of content contained in the document. Only two levels are specified, ''mature'' and ''adult'', making the specification extremely simple.

==Use in public libraries==

===United States===
The use of Internet filters or content-control software varies widely in public libraries in the United States, since Internet use policies are established by the local library board. Many libraries adopted Internet filters after Congress conditioned the receipt of universal service discounts on the use of Internet filters through the [[Children's Internet Protection Act]] (CIPA). Other libraries do not install content control software, believing that acceptable use policies and educational efforts address the issue of children accessing [[age-inappropriate]] content while preserving adult users' right to freely access information. Some libraries use Internet filters on computers used by children only. Some libraries that employ content-control software allow the software to be deactivated on a case-by-case basis on application to a librarian; libraries that are subject to CIPA are required to have a policy that allows adults to request that the filter be disabled without having to explain the reason for their request.

Many legal scholars believe that a number of legal cases, in particular ''[[Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union]]'', established that the use of content-control software in libraries is a violation of the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spectacle.org/cs/library.bak |title=Purchase of blocking software by public libraries is unconstitutional |accessdate= |last=Wallace |first=Jonathan D. |date=November 9, 1997 |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Children's Internet Protection Act [CIPA] and the June 2003 case ''[[United States v. American Library Association]]'' found CIPA constitutional as a condition placed on the receipt of federal funding, stating that First Amendment concerns were dispelled by the law's provision that allowed adult library users to have the filtering software disabled, without having to explain the reasons for their request. The plurality decision left open a future "as-applied" Constitutional challenge, however.

In November 2006, a lawsuit was filed against the North Central Regional Library District (NCRL) in Washington State for its policy of refusing to disable restrictions upon requests of adult patrons, but CIPA was not challenged in that matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aclu-wa.org/detail.cfm?id=557 |title=ACLU Suit Seeks Access to Information on Internet for Library Patrons |accessdate= |work= |publisher=ACLU of Washington |date=November 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, the Washington State Supreme Court provided an opinion after it was asked to certify a question referred by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington: “Whether a public library, consistent with Article I, § 5 of the Washington Constitution, may filter Internet access for all patrons without disabling Web sites containing constitutionally-protected speech upon the request of an adult library patron.” The Washington State Supreme Court ruled that NCRL’s internet filtering policy did not violate Article I, Section 5 of the Washington State Constitution. The Court said: “It appears to us that NCRL’s filtering policy is reasonable and accords with its mission and these policies and is viewpoint neutral. It appears that no article I, section 5 content-based violation exists in this case. NCRL’s essential mission is to promote reading and lifelong learning. As NCRL maintains, it is reasonable to impose restrictions on Internet access in order to maintain an environment that is conducive to study and contemplative thought.” The case returned to federal court.

In March 2007, Virginia passed a law similar to CIPA that requires public libraries receiving state funds to use content-control software. Like CIPA, the law requires libraries to disable filters for an adult library user when requested to do so by the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Sluss |title=Kaine signs library bill: The legislation requires public libraries to block obscene material with Internet filters |url=http://www.roanoke.com/politics/wb/wb/xp-109919 |work= |publisher=The Roanoke Times |date=March 23, 2007 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The Australian Internet Safety Advisory Body has information about "practical advice on Internet safety, parental control and filters for the protection of children, students and families" that also includes public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcw.vic.edu.au/Our%20School/Parents%20Guide%20to%20Internet%20Safety.pdf |title=NetAlert: Parents Guide to Internet Safety |publisher=Australian Communications and Media Authority |date=2 August 2007 |accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NetAlert, the software made available free of charge by the Australian government, was allegedly cracked by a 16-year-old student, Tom Wood, less than a week after its release in August 2007. Wood supposedly bypassed the $84 million filter in about half an hour to highlight problems with the government's approach to Internet content filtering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Teenager-cracks-govts-84m-porn-filter/2007/08/25/1187462562907.html |title=Teenager cracks govt's $84m porn filter |agency=Australian Associated Press (AAP) |work=Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Digital |date=25 August 2007 |accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Government has introduced legislation that requires ISP's to "restrict access to age restricted content (commercial MA15+ content and R18+ content) either hosted in Australia or provided from Australia" that was due to commence from 20 January 2008, known as [[Cleanfeed (content blocking system)|Cleanfeed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/_assets/main/lib310563/ras_declaration_2007.pdf |title=Restricted Access Systems Declaration 2007 |publisher=Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) |year=2007 |accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleanfeed is a proposed mandatory ISP level content filtration system. It was proposed by the [[Kim Beazley|Beazley]] led [[Australian Labor Party]] opposition in a 2006 press release, with the intention of protecting children who were vulnerable due to claimed parental computer illiteracy. It was announced on 31 December 2007 as a policy to be implemented by the [[Kevin Rudd|Rudd]] ALP government, and initial tests in [[Tasmania]] have produced a 2008 report. Cleanfeed is funded in the current budget, and is moving towards an Expression of Interest for live testing with ISPs in 2008. Public opposition and criticism have emerged, led by the [[Electronic Frontiers Australia|EFA]] and gaining irregular mainstream media attention, with a majority of Australians reportedly "strongly against" its implementation.&lt;ref name="nocleanfeed.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nocleanfeed.com/learn.html |title=Learn - No Clean Feed - Stop Internet Censorship in Australia |publisher=Electronic Frontiers Australia |date= |accessdate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms include its expense, inaccuracy (it will be impossible to ensure only illegal sites are blocked) and the fact that it will be compulsory, which can be seen as an intrusion on free speech rights.&lt;ref name="nocleanfeed.com"/&gt; Another major criticism point has been that although the filter is claimed to stop certain materials, the underground rings dealing in such materials will not be affected.

== Bypassing filters ==
{{Main article |Internet censorship circumvention}}

Content filtering in general can "be bypassed entirely by tech-savvy individuals." Blocking content on a device "[will not]...guarantee that users won't eventually be able to find a way around the filter."&lt;ref name="techsoup"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityvision.edu/wiki/understanding-content-filtering-faq-nonprofits |title=Understanding Content Filtering: An FAQ for Nonprofits |last=Satterfield |first=Brian |date=4 June 2007 |publisher=Techsoup.org |accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some software may be bypassed successfully by using alternative protocols such as [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] or [[telnet]] or [[HTTPS]], conducting searches in a different language, using a [[proxy server]] or a circumventor such as [[Psiphon]]. Also cached web pages returned by Google or other searches could bypass some controls as well. Web syndication services may provide alternate paths for content. Some of the more poorly designed programs can be shut down by killing their processes: for example, in [[Microsoft Windows]] through the Windows [[Task Manager]], or in [[Mac OS X]] using Force Quit or [[Activity Monitor (macOS)|Activity Monitor]]. Numerous workarounds and counters to workarounds from content-control software creators exist.
[[Google]] services are often blocked by filters, but these may most often be bypassed by using ''https://'' in place of ''http://'' since content filtering software is not able to interpret content under secure connections (in this case SSL).

Many content filters have an option which allows authorized people to bypass the content filter. This is especially useful in environments where the computer is being supervised and the content filter is aggressively blocking Web sites that need to be accessed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

An encrypted [[VPN]] can be used as means of bypassing content control software, especially if the content control software is installed on an Internet gateway or firewall.

There many other ways in which to bypass a content control filter that include translation sites, establishing a remote connection with another computer that has no content control filter on it and altering the proxy settings of the browser.&lt;ref name="comdodome"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cdome.comodo.com/bypass-avoid-internet-filters.php |title=Is It Possible To Easily Avoid Internet Filters? |last=|first=|date=4 June 2007 |publisher=comodo.com |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sometimes, an antivirus software with web protection may stop the content-control filter.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Products and services==

Some ISPs offer [[parental control]] options. Some offer security software which includes parental controls. [[Mac OS X v10.4]] offers parental controls for several applications ([[Mail (OS X)|Mail]], [[Macintosh Finder|Finder]], [[iChat]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] &amp; [[Dictionary (software)|Dictionary]]). Microsoft's [[Windows Vista]] operating system also includes content-control software.

Content filtering technology exists in two major forms: [[Application-level gateway|application gateway]] or [[Deep packet inspection|packet inspection]]. For HTTP access the application gateway is called a web-proxy or just a proxy. Such web-proxies can inspect both the initial request and the returned web page using arbitrarily complex rules and will not return any part of the page to the requester until a decision is made. In addition they can make substitutions in whole or for any part of the returned result. Packet inspection filters do not initially interfere with the connection to the server but inspect the data in the connection as it goes past, at some point the filter may decide that the connection is to be filtered and it will then disconnect it by injecting a TCP-Reset or similar faked packet. The two techniques can be used together with the packet filter monitoring a link until it sees an HTTP connection starting to an IP address that has content that needs filtering. The packet filter then redirects the connection to the [[Proxy server#Intercepting proxy server|web-proxy]] which can perform detailed filtering on the website without having to pass through all unfiltered connections. This combination is [[Cleanfeed (content blocking system)|quite popular]] because it can significantly reduce the cost of the system.

Gateway-based content control software may be more difficult to bypass than desktop software as the user does not have physical access to the filtering device. However, many of the techniques in the [[Content-control software#Bypassing filters|Bypassing filters]] section still work.

'''Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi''' ({{lang-ar|رافد أحمد علوان الجنابي}}, {{transl|ar|Rāfid Aḥmad Alwān}}; born 1968), known by the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] [[cryptonym]] '''"Curveball"''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/02/nation/na-intel2|title=Bob Drogin, Greg Miller.

''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', April 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[German people|German citizen]] who [[Defection|defected]] from Iraq in 1999, claiming that he had worked as a [[chemical engineer]] at a plant that manufactured [[Mobile weapons laboratory|mobile biological weapon laboratories]] as part of an [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraqi weapons of mass destruction program]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7075501.stm|title=Iraq war source's name revealed|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2007-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alwan's allegations were subsequently shown to be false by the [[Iraq Survey Group]]'s [[Iraq Survey Group#Duelfer Report|final report]] published in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB234/index.htm|title=The Record on CURVEBALL: Declassified Documents and Key Participants Show the Importance of Phony Intelligence in the Origins of the Iraq War|publisher=[[National Security Archive]], The George Washington University |date=2007-11-07|accessdate=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reports/08-1NRspring/p12-drogin.html|title=Determining the Reliability of a Key CIA Source |first=Bob|last=Drogin|publisher=Nieman Foundation for Journalism at [[Harvard University]]|date=Spring 2008|accessdate=2008-04-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421051455/http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reports/08-1NRspring/p12-drogin.html |archivedate=2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite warnings from the [[Germany|German]] [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|Federal Intelligence Service]] and the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] questioning the authenticity of the claims, the US Government and British government utilized them to build a [[Rationale for the Iraq War|rationale for military action]] in the lead up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], including in the [[2003 State of the Union address]], where [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] said "we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs", and [[Colin Powell]]'s [[United Nations Security Council and the Iraq War#Colin Powell's presentation|presentation to the UN Security Council]], which contained a computer generated image of a ''mobile biological weapons laboratory''.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:George W. Bush's Third State of the Union Address]]&lt;/ref&gt; They were later found to be mobile milk pasteurization and hydrogen generation trailers. On 24 September 2002, the British government published its dossier on the former Iraqi leader's WMD with a personal foreword by Blair, who assured readers Saddam Hussein had continued to produce WMD "beyond doubt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21786506 |publisher=BBC News |title=Iraq: The spies who fooled the world |date=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claims and background ==
Rafid Ahmed Alwan studied chemical engineering in university but received low marks. He also worked at the Babel television production company in Baghdad, which was owned by [[Saddam Hussein]]'s son [[Uday Hussein|Uday]]; sometime after leaving his job, a warrant was issued for his arrest because of theft from the same company.&lt;ref name="CBSname" /&gt;

Curveball's story began in November 1999 when Alwan, then in his early 30s, arrived at [[Munich]]'s [[Munich Airport|Franz Josef Strauss Airport]] with a [[tourist visa]]. Upon entering the country he applied for political asylum because he had embezzled Iraqi government money and faced prison or worse if sent home. The German refugee system sent him to [[Zirndorf]], a refugee center near [[Nuremberg]].&lt;ref name="commondreams" /&gt;

After he arrived at the refugee center he changed his story. Alwan's new story included that after he had graduated at the top of his [[chemical engineer]]ing class at Baghdad University in 1994,&lt;ref name="cooperativeresearch"&gt;{{cite web|date=2005-11-20 |url=http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/context.jsp?item=complete_timeline_of_the_2003_invasion_of_iraq_3280 |title=Complete timeline of the 2003 invasion of iraq |publisher=cooperativeresearch.org |accessdate=2007-07-23 |quote=He speaks to his BND debriefers in Arabic through a translator, and also in broken English and German. Curveball says that he worked for Iraq's Military Industrial Commission after graduating first in his class from engineering school at Baghdad University in 1994 (He actually graduated last (see 1994)). A year later, he says, he was assigned to work for "Dr. Germ", British-trained microbiologist [[Rihab Taha|Rihab Rashid Taha]], to construct mobile biological weapons labs. But Curveball never says that he actually produced biological weapons or witnessed anyone else doing so and the BND is unable to verify his claims. Curveball's statements are recorded in German, shared with a local Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) team, and sent to the US, where they are translated into English for analysis at the DIA's directorate for human intelligence in Clarendon, Va. "This was not substantial evidence," one senior German intelligence official later recalls in an interview with the ''Los Angeles Times''. "We made clear we could not verify the things he said." The reports are then sent to the CIA's Weapons Intelligence, Non-Proliferation and Arms Control Center (WINPAC), whose experts analyze the data and share it with artists who use Curveball's accounts to render sketches. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033512/http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/context.jsp?item=complete_timeline_of_the_2003_invasion_of_iraq_3280 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; he worked for "Dr. Germ," British-trained [[microbiologist]] [[Rihab Taha|Rihab Rashid Taha]] to lead a team that built mobile labs to produce lethal [[Biological weapon|biological WMD]].&lt;ref name="cooperativeresearch" /&gt;

The Germans listened to his claims and debriefed him starting in December 1999,&lt;ref&gt;Drogin, Bob, ''Curveball'', Random House, 2007, p.12: "it was nearly Christmas 1999"&lt;/ref&gt; continuing to September 2001. Although the Americans did not have "direct access" to Curveball,&lt;ref&gt;Drogin, Bob, ''Curveball'', Random House, 2007, p.31: "senior BND officials decided to bar the CIA from talking to their new source", p.36: "Curveball hates Americans, they told the visiting DIA team. He absolutely refuses to meet any Americans. … Sorry, they said, he's completely off limits."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chulov, Martin and Pidd, Helen [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/15/defector-admits-wmd-lies-iraq-war Defector admits to WMD lies that triggered Iraq war], ''The Guardian'': "After [Powell's speech at the UN], Janabi said he called his handler at the BND and accused the secret service of breaking an agreement that they would not share anything he had told them with another country"&lt;/ref&gt; information collected by the [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|BND]] debriefing team was later passed on in part to the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Drogin, Bob, ''Curveball'', Random House, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As an incentive to keep supplying information to German intelligence, Curveball had been granted asylum, as he had applied earlier in 1999 and failed.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news |date=2006-06-25 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/24/AR2006062401081_pf.html|title=Warnings on WMD 'Fabricator' Were Ignored, Ex-CIA Aide Says |work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2007-07-23 |author=Warrick, Joby }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had enough money that he did not have to work. He gave many hours of testimony about Iraq's [[Weapons of Mass Destruction|WMD]] program and in particular its [[mobile weapons laboratory|mobile weapons laboratories]]. Despite CIA technicians and weapon experts finding major flaws and inconsistencies with the designs and systems he asserted the military was developing, this information made it to the American government and although there were wide doubts and questions about the claimed informant's reliability and background, assertions attributed to Curveball claiming that Iraq was creating [[biological agents]] in mobile weapons laboratories to elude inspectors appeared in more than 112 [[United States government]] reports between January 2000 and September 2001.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"&gt;{{cite web |date=2006-12-04 |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iraq/bw-mobile.htm|title=Mobile Biological Weapons Facilities – Winnebagos of Death |publisher=globalsecurity.org|accessdate=2007-07-24 |author=Pike, John |quote=From January 2000 to September 2001, the Defense Intelligence Agency's (DIA) Human Intelligence disseminated almost 112 reports from Curveball regarding mobile BW facilities in Iraq.

According to a Danish state TV documentary, DR1 Dokumentaren "Manden som løj verden i krig"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dr.dk/DR1/Dokumentar/2010/0412145040.htm|title=''Manden som løj verden i krig''(The man who lied the world into war)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423152451/http://www.dr.dk/DR1/Dokumentar/2010/0412145040.htm|archivedate=2010-04-23|website=[[Danish State Radio]]|date=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; broadcast April 21, 2010, Curveball is still living in Germany under strong protection of the German police. Danish TV filmed Rafid on the streets and recorded clips of conversation with him, before he surreptitiously called the police and had the TV-crew banned from his neighbourhood.

== Criticism, investigation, and damage control ==
In 2003, inspectors led by [[David Kay]] conducted additional investigation of Curveball's credibility. They found among other things that he had been placed last in his university class when he had claimed to have been placed first, and that he had been jailed for embezzlement before fleeing to Germany.

In response to public criticism, [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[George W. Bush|Bush]] initiated an [[Iraq Intelligence Commission|investigative commission]] who released their report on March 31, 2005. Bush's investigative commission came to many conclusions including:
* Curveball's German intelligence handlers saw him as "crazy … out of control", his friends called him a "congenital liar", and a US physician working for the Defense Department who travelled to Germany to take blood samples seeking to discover if Anthrax spores were present was stunned to find the defector had shown up for medical tests with a "blistering hangover",&lt;ref&gt;Bob Drogin, ''Curveball'' (Ebury Press, 2007), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; and he "might be an alcoholic".&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;{{cite news|date=2005-04-03|url= https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1451167,00.html|title=US relied on 'drunken liar' to justify war|work=[[The Observer]]|accessdate=2007-07-24|author=Helmore, Edward |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* While there were many reports that Curveball was actually a relative (younger brother) of one of [[Ahmed Chalabi]]'s [[Iraqi National Congress]] (INC) top aides,&lt;ref name="VV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |date=2004-04-02|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1184172,00.html|title=Germans accuse US over Iraq weapons claim |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2007-07-24 |author=Harding, Luke |quote=It has now emerged that Curveball is the brother of a top aide of Ahmad Chalabi, the pro-western Iraqi former exile with links to the Pentagon. |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the investigative commission stated that it was "unable to uncover any evidence that the INC or any other organization was directing Curveball."&lt;ref name="LATIMES"&gt;{{cite web|date=2005-04-01 |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0401-10.htm |title=Intelligence Analysts Whiffed on a 'Curveball' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=2007-07-24 |author1=Miller, Greg |author2=Drogin, Bob |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803124926/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0401-10.htm |archivedate=2007-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Bush administration ignored evidence from the UN weapons inspectors that Curveball's claims were false. Curveball had identified a particular Iraqi facility as a docking station for mobile labs. Satellite photography had showed a wall made such access impossible, but it was theorised that this wall was temporary. "When [[United Nations Monitoring Verification and Inspection Commission]] (UNMOVIC) inspectors visited the site on February 9, 2003, they found that the wall was a permanent structure and could find nothing to corroborate Curveball's statements."&lt;ref name="UNMOVIC"&gt;{{cite news |date=2005-04-03 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A21854-2005Apr2?language=printer|title=Panel: U.S. Ignored Work of U.N. Arms Inspectors |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=2007-07-24 |author=Linzer, Dafna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the inspectors found the warehouse to be used for seed processing.&lt;ref&gt;Drogin, Bob, ''Curveball'', Random House, 2007, pp 170-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blame ===
The Bush administration laid blame on the CIA, criticizing its officials for "failing to investigate" doubts about Curveball, which emerged after an October 2002 [[National Intelligence Estimate]]. In May 2004, over a year after the invasion of Iraq, the CIA concluded formally that Curveball's information was fabricated. Furthermore, on June 26, 2006, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that "the CIA acknowledged that Curveball was a [[con artist]] who drove a [[Taxicab|taxi]] in Iraq and spun his engineering knowledge into a fantastic but plausible tale about secret bioweapons factories on wheels."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt;

On April 8, 2005, [[CIA Director]] [[Porter Goss]] ordered an internal review of the CIA in order to determine why doubts about Curveball's reliability were not forwarded to policy makers. Former CIA Director [[George Tenet]] and his former deputy, [[John E. McLaughlin]], announced that they were not aware of doubts about Curveball's veracity before the war. However, [[Tyler Drumheller]], the former chief of the CIA's European division, told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that "everyone in the chain of command knew exactly what was happening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/02/nation/na-intel2|title='Curveball' Debacle Reignites CIA Feud|first1=Bob|last1=Drogin|first2=Greg|last2=Miller|date=2 April 2005|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Admission of fabrication ===
In February 2011, Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi admitted for the first time that he lied about his story regarding Iraq's secret biological weapons program.&lt;ref name=Admit&gt;Chulov, Martin and Pidd, Helen (2011-02-15) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/15/defector-admits-wmd-lies-iraq-war Defector admits to WMD lies that triggered Iraq war], ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He also admitted to being shocked that his false story was used as a justification for the [[Iraq War]] but proud that the fabrications helped topple [[Saddam Hussein]].

According to the Danish ''The Man Who Lied the World Into War'' film (2010/2011 update, basing on sources) after he was found by the document makers and they put questions to the chief security and spy services of his new home country, he lost his "work" (in a company found and described by the document makers as a cover with his position of "marketing specialist") and "salary with flat". Then, when he had to get back to the social one-room flat with social security help-salary, he phoned the documentary staff proposing an interview for the €40,000 (before the UK newspaper article). He also showed papers which, according to him, clearly proved that a contract between him and this "cover company" had been signed for the 15 years, starting in the 1999/2000, with a relatively high monthly salary of €3,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.idfa.nl/nl/tags/project.aspx?id=7835B512-0135-454F-997A-734F7C602478 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075136/http://www.idfa.nl/nl/tags/project.aspx?id=7835B512-0135-454F-997A-734F7C602478 |archive-date=2014-04-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dr.dk/Salg/DRsales/Programmes/Documentary/Current_Affairs_and_Politics/20100223124446.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327040351/http://www.dr.dk/Salg/DRsales/Programmes/Documentary/Current_Affairs_and_Politics/20100223124446.htm |archive-date=2014-03-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30590">The '''Declaration of Human Duties and Responsibilities''' ('''DHDR''') was written for reinforcing the implementation of human rights under the auspices of the [[UNESCO]] and the interest of the [[UN High Commissioner of Human Rights]] and was proclaimed in 1998 "to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]"(UDHR) in the city of [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]. Therefore, it is also known as the Valencia Declaration.

Considering that the major challenge for this new century is the effective and efficient realisation of human rights for all people, and that at the same time is needed that all members of the human family strive for its fulfilment, the DHDR formulates related [[duty|duties]] and [[moral responsibility|responsibilities]] for our current interdependence. Its preamble states categorically: The effective enjoyment and implementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms is inextricably linked to the assumption of the duties and responsibilities implicit in those rights.....

After fifty years of the adoption of the UDHR and following human rights instruments, the point of departure of the DHDR Preamble is the shared concern regarding the lack of political will for enforcing globally human rights. Moreover, the DHDR takes into account the new challenges of the global scenario for translating semantically rights into duties and responsibilities. “Recognising the changes that new technologies, scientific development and the process of Mondialisation have brought about, and aware of the need to address their impact upon and potential consequences for human rights and fundamental freedoms“, states in its Preamble.

Its 12 chapters and 41 articles can be compared with the human rights such as formulated in the UDHR and recent initiatives that reflect a similar preoccupation for the formulation of duties and responsibilities, such as the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration]], the [[Statute of Rome]], the [[United Nations Global Compact|Global Compact]], [[The Earth Charter]], the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and [[Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity|UNESCO declarations]] and conventions.

==History==

The drafting of the declaration has been the result of the committed and disinterested work of a group of experts integrated by Nobel laureates - [[Joseph Rotblat]], [[Wole Soyinka]] and [[Dario Fo]] -, scientists, artists and philosophers representing all the regions of the world –among them, [[Federico Mayor Zaragoza]], [[Richard Falk]], [[Ruud Lubbers]], [[Frank Judd, Baron Judd|Lord Frank Judd]], [[Sergey Kapitsa]], [[Jakob von Uexküll]], [[Fernando Savater]]-, and the judicious chairmanship of [[Richard Goldstone]] from South Africa and among its members. This process was inspired by the need –in words of Justice Goldstone- of the transition from a “formal equality” to a “substantial equality, with a shared concern of the situation of millions of ignored and marginalised people in our globalised world: “the recognition of human rights is insufficient, … if such so rights are to be realized it is necessary that they are enforceable... There must be a duty on all relevant authorities and individuals to enforce those rights.”   With a convergent perspective, Norberto Bobbio has entirely supported the initiative and the text of the DHDR, in particular taking into account the main concern for humanity of reinforcing the international systems. In that context he has established an interesting comparison between the transition from “moral rights” to “legal rights” and the need to transform “moral duties” into “legal duties” (See: Norberto Bobbio, Declaration of Human Duties and Responsibilities, page 98).

This Declaration proposes comprehensively the implicit system of duties and responsibilities contained in our [[human rights]] systems, in particular that enshrined in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and in subsequent [[international human rights instruments]] and establishes consequently their bearers.

==The DHDR Chapter I: The General Provisions==

In the DHDR Article 1 “duty” and “responsibility” are defined for the purpose of the declaration: "duty" means an ethical or moral obligation; and "responsibility", an obligation that is legally binding under existing [[international law]].
The DHDR explains in details the complexity of the exercise of responsibilities. The bearers are the members of the global community that have collective, as well as individual duties and responsibilities, to promote universal observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms. “Global community" means both States and non-States actors: international, regional and sub-regional intergovernmental organisations, non-governmental organisations, public and private sector (trans)national corporations, other entities of civil society, peoples, communities and individuals taken as a collective.

The DHDR reflects the gamma of both states and non-states actors that have to be mutual supportive bearers of duties and responsibilities. On the contrary, the UN Millennium Declaration  (MD), recent international document of the governments, is focused primarily on the States responsibilities that is shared and collective: “We /heads of State and Government / recognize that, in addition to our separate responsibilities to our individual societies, we have a collective responsibility to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality and equity at the global level. As leaders we have a duty therefore to all the world’s people…”

The DHDR Article 2 is dedicated to postulate exhaustively the bearers of duties and responsibilities: “Members of the global community have collective, as well as individual duties and responsibilities, to promote universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms.…”  This declaration considers the existence of collective responsibilities inside the limits traced by the universally recognized rights, with the implicit consequences of accountability that would be fairly distributed. The DHDR addresses simultaneously the responsibilities of individuals and groups. It states: “As the holders of human rights and fundamental freedoms, all individuals, peoples and communities in the exercise of their rights and freedoms, have the duty and responsibility to respect those of others, and a duty to strive for the promotion and observance thereof”. This statement continues appropriately the way initiated by the UDHR in Article 29 and reiterates the interaction of duties, responsibilities and rights of the [[International Covenants on Human Rights]] of 1966.

==DHDR Chapter 2: The right to life and human security==

Most of the titles of the DHDR chapters enunciate a right or fundamental freedom that will be the thematic focus of the related duties and responsibilities. Chapter 2 begins the list of duties and responsibilities with the right to life and human security, rights to be secure for the present and also future generations in the awareness that for the first time in human history the humankind survival is in peril due to human action. Following the UDHR Article 3 “Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person”; this chapter draws our attention to the intergenerational responsibility.

The DHDR Article 3 is dedicated to the duty and responsibility to protect the life of every member of the human family and ensure the survival of both present and future generations. That means “to take reasonable steps to help others whose lives are threatened, or who are in extreme distress or need”. A key element of the formulation of the DHDR has been the present duty and responsibility for the potential consequences of our actions for the future generations. “The rights of these future generations are the duties of present generations” summarises correctly Federico Mayor, the then Director General UNESCO. Therefore, the right to peace and the right to live in a balanced ecological environment have to be recognized and guaranteed. In a broader sense, the Earth Charter, a declaration of principles for a sustainable world, emphasises the urgency of sharing responsibility for caring for the community of life, including the well-being of human family.

The DHDR Article 4 enunciates the duty and responsibility to promote collective security and a culture of peace of all members of the global community. War and conflict prevention, fostering international peace, global security and cooperation are needed for this purpose. The responsibility of States, according to UN Chapter 7, is underlined and also their duty strengthening mediation, conflict prevention and post-conflict peace-building mechanisms and [[peace-keeping]] capacities.

The DHDR Article 5 is dedicated to the duty and responsibility to promote rapid and effective disarmament in the interests of peace. Primarily the States are in charge of reducing military expenditure in favour of human development, and together with no-States actors to carry our nuclear disarmament, to cease any production or use of all chemical and biological weapons, and use of landmines.

The Duty to intervene to prevent gross human rights violations is stated in the DHDR Article 6 that means the commission of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other gross or systematic human rights abuses in all circumstances. States are mainly in charge of preventing and also punishing such violations, and there is also a collective duty of the States to intervene in the case where individual State fails to prevent such abuses. UN Chapter 7 remains general framework for this responsibility. For defining gross human rights violations and the need of prevention and punishment this chapter has been inspired by the Rome Statute  that was adopted some months before this Declaration was finalised.

The DHDR Article 7 enunciates the duty and responsibility unconditionally and in all circumstances to respect international humanitarian law during times of armed conflict. This law, commonly infringed, means for the government forces and insurgents, military or paramilitary forces the obligation to refrain from committing acts of genocide; crimes against humanity, and [[war crimes]], as [[mass killing]], [[torture]] or [[rape]].

The focus of DHDR Article 8 is the duty and responsibility of humanitarian assistance and intervention to those in need. In a globalised world with millions of displaced people, it is claimed for the adequate provision of food, shelter, health care and other essential requirements for survival to ensure the right to life for everyone on the world.

The DHDR Article 9 finishes this chapter with the duty and responsibility to protect and promote a safe, stable and healthy environment, promoting respect, protection and preservation of the uniqueness and diversity of all forms of life. An adequate use of resources avoiding excessive exploitation and consumption, and a collaborative scientific research and exchange of information are required. This article promotes similarly to the Kyoto Protocol, an international and legally binding agreement to reduce greenhouse gases emissions worldwide, an urgent change of attitude towards the environment. This duty for the present and future generations has already been confirmed by a broad scientific consensus on the existence of climate change and the human responsibility.

==DHDR Chapter 3: Human security and an equitable international order==

The DHDR Article 10 emphasises the duty and responsibility to promote an equitable international order for the universal enjoyment of sustainable human, economic, social, cultural, political, scientific and technological development and equitably participation in the decision-making processes for an interdependent and technologically well equipped world, providing an extensive vision of the general formulation of the UDHR Article 28: “Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fully realized”. The DHDR statements are categorical: “Economic policies and development should not be pursued at the expense of human rights or social development” (6), “Economic and social development shall not be pursued at the expense of the environment and natural resources” (7), and “As sovereign and equal members of the international community, all States have the right to participate fully, equitably and effectively in international and global institutions and decision-making processes…(8)” Coincidentally to the DHDR proposals the “millennium development goals” of the MD set an influential agenda for a global partnership to fight poverty, establishing shared goals for a better world by 2015. Their fulfilment is measurable indicated by a progress at quantitative level.

Following the previous article, the DHDR Article 11 enunciates the duty to alleviate usurious debt that would endanger human lives and impede economic and social development.

This Chapter continues with the DHDR Article 12 dedicated to the duty and responsibility to promote safe, responsible and equitable scientific and technological development for the benefit of all humankind. The UNESCO spirit  of encouraging universally intellectual and moral solidarity is emphasised, in particular taking into account the condition of the  lesser scientifically advanced States. In particular this article has received a good reception by several scientists and related people. Neutrality of science appears today as an illusion, in particular considering formerly scientific advances such as in genetics or cybernetics. This DHDR approach reinforces fully the importance of the recent UNESCO ethical documents  for biosciences, and also other efforts for codifying ethical principles for the use of science.

The DHDR Article 13 enunciates duties and responsibilities of public and private sector corporations, indicating as common criteria the respect for sovereignty of host countries and simultaneously fully respect and promotion of universal human rights and international labour standards. For having an ethical code of the corporations and for promoting a more sustainable and inclusive global economy, the then UN General Secretary, Kofi Annan, has proposed the Global Compact, an international initiative bringing companies together with UN agencies, labour and civil society to support universal environmental and social principles, that was finally launched in 2000.

The DHDR Article 14 enunciates the duty and responsibility to prevent and punish international and organised crime as a shared task of the members of the global community. This article also has the innovative approach of global cooperation of the Statute of Rome, for combating of international crimes, transnational crimes and organised crime and assisting international criminal tribunals.

The focus of the DHDR Article 15 is the duty and responsibility to eradicate corruption and build an ethical society in both the public and private sectors, implementing codes of conduct and training programmes, and promoting accountability, transparency public awareness of the harm caused by corruption. This emphasis in code of ethics was also encouraged by the [[United Nations Global Compact|Global Compact]], in particular for the private sector.

==DHDR Chapter 4: Meaningful participation in public affairs==

The DHDR Article 16 expresses the duty and responsibility to ensure meaningful participation in public affairs, for ensuring that the authority of government is based upon the will of the people and the rule of law. This promoted participation reiterates the universal right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives of the UDHR Article 21 at different levels, in local, national and global governance.

==DHDR Chapter 5: Freedom of opinion, expression, assembly, association and religion==

Following the content of the UDHR Article 19 on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the DHDR Article 17 reformulates the duty and responsibility to respect and ensure freedom of opinion, expression, and the media, providing concrete measures for the world today, affirming the pursuit of truth as unhindered, and condemning any degrading treatment of individuals and the presentation of violence as entertainment. And Article 17 also insists that "the media and journalists have a duty to report honestly and accurately to avoid incitement of racial, ethnic or religious violence or hatred. (''see: Article 20 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]'')

The DHDR Article 18 establishes duties and responsibilities concerning information and communications technologies with the aim of ensuring universal access to basic communication and information infrastructure and services. Similarly, UNESCO has already made a recommendation on information promoting universal access to cyberspace.

Complementing the UDHR Article 20 on the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association the DHDR Article 19 enunciates the duty and responsibility to take all necessary steps to ensure the substantive realisation of the rights to free assembly and freedom of association.

Finally, the DHDR Article 20, following the UDHR Article 18 on the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, formulates the related duty and responsibility to respect and ensure freedom of religion, belief and conscience, and of having or not having a religion or belief.

==DHDR Chapter 6: The right to personal and physical integrity==

The DHDR Article 21 focused on formulating the duty and responsibility to respect and ensure the physical, psychological and personal [[integrity]] of all members of the human family in all circumstances, including in situations of armed conflict, reformulate the UDHR articles 10-12 dedicated to the rights to personal integrity and respect for [[privacy]].

The DHDR Article 22 enunciates the duty and responsibility to take all necessary measures to respect and ensure the right to personal liberty and physical security, in first place by the States, preventing arbitrary arrest and detention and ensuring that all arrests and detentions are carried out in accordance with universally recognised standards of fairness and due process.

The DHDR Article 23 emphasises today the duty and responsibility to prohibit and prevent slavery and institutions and practices similar to slavery and slave-like practices including child prostitution, child exploitation, enforced prostitution, debt bondage, serfdom, and other forms of enforced labour inconsistent with international law, punishing such practices; instituting effective controls to prevent the illegal trafficking of persons; creating greater public awareness through education of the human rights abuses associated with such practices. The UDHR Article 4 states that “no one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms”. Today slavery is still not eradicated from the world, although universally condemned.

The DHDR Article 24 enunciates the duty and responsibility to condemn torture and to take all necessary measures to prevent torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, declaring criminal and punishing all acts of torture, cruel and inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, enforcing strict controls over places and conditions of custody of persons deprived of their liberty. This enunciation specifies the duty for achieving the content of UDHR Article 5: “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”.

DHDR Article 25: The duty and responsibility to condemn and to prevent and eradicate enforced disappearances declaring criminal and punishing all acts of forced disappearances, ensuring that persons deprived of their liberty are only held in officially recognised places of detention, and that they have adequate access to judicial officers, legal representation, medical personnel and family members during the course of their detention.

==DHDR Chapter 7: Equality==

After trying to meet the major global challenges of our interdependent world, that are affecting today humankind as a whole. The DHDR Chapter 7 rethinks the principle of equality, such as states in the first UDHR articles. With a similar approach the UNESCO has already approved two meaningful documents promoting cultural diversity, the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity (2001) and the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (2005).
The DHDR Article 26 enunciates in general the duty to respect, ensure and promote the right to equal treatment and to eradicate [[discrimination]] in all its forms.

The DHDR Article 27 states the duty and responsibility for the States, in primary place, to respect and ensure the substantive equality of every member of human family, not only ensuring equality before the law, but also taking positive action to prevent direct or indirect discrimination.

In the DHDR Article 28 is enunciated the duty and responsibility to ensure substantive racial and religious equality, that means to ensure the effective enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms without discrimination on the basis of race, religion or ethnicity, and to condemn all forms of racial and religious discrimination and respect racial, ethnic and religious diversity; promoting equal opportunities for all.

The DHDR Article 29 formulates the duty and responsibility to ensure sex and gender equality and the recognition of women's rights as human rights. In particular the States have to ensure the effective enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms without discrimination on the basis of sex or gender, promoting the equality in the representation and participation of women in the public and political life, the eradication of cultural, religious and social practices which discriminate against women; the economic empowerment of women and the recognition of the full legal capacity of women.

The DHDR Article 30 is dedicated to the duty and responsibility to ensure the substantive equality of persons with a disability, and to ensure the enjoyment and exercise of all human rights and fundamental freedoms without discrimination on the basis of [[disability]].

Some progress towards the accomplishment of this duty can be observed at international level. In March 2006, the UN Programme on Disability has been consolidated into the Secretariat for the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

==DHDR Chapter 8: Protection of minorities and indigenous peoples==

Reinforcing the fulfilment of equality, the aim of the Chapter 8 is to emphasise the need for protection of [[minority group|minorities]] and [[indigenous people]]s. Both the global community and the States are considered by this Declaration as the major responsible, collectively and individually for ensuring the rights of these [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]] groups.

The DHDR Article 31 formulates the duty and responsibility to respect and protect the existence, identity and rights of national, ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, having the States a primary duty and responsibility to take adequate measures. The above referred efforts of the UNESCO for protecting the value of cultural diversity and cultural expressions are a reflection of this obligation.

The DHDR Article 32 enunciates the duty and responsibility to respect, protect and promote the rights of indigenous peoples, in particular their right to preserve, maintain and develop their identities and to protect their means of livelihood, in a general context of respect of universal human rights. Indigenous rights are diversely protected at national level, but it is much needed that the international community assumes collectively their responsibility. It is also expected that the proposed declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples will be again considered for approval in September 2007 by the UN General Assembly in order to protect these rights universally.

==DHDR Chapter 9: Rights of the child and the elderly==

The chapter 9 deals also with the implementation of the principle of equality taking into account the primary responsibilities of the States for the children and elderly rights.

The DHDR Article 33 emphasises the duty and responsibility to respect, protect and promote the [[children's rights|rights of the child]], following the content of the almost universally ratified UN [[Convention on the Right of the Child]] (1989) and aware, that although this excellent document is shared broadly by the international community, today million of children are still innocent victims of armed conflict, extreme poverty and hunger.

The DHDR Article 34 is dedicated to the formulation of the duty and responsibility to promote and enforce the rights and wellbeing of the elderly, trying to ensure the full and effective enjoyment by elderly people of all human rights and fundamental freedoms without discrimination on the basis of age, and to respect the well-being, dignity and physical and personal integrity of the elderly. Although major efforts are being made by the United Nations, such as the International Year of Older Persons (1999) and the formulation UN Principles addressing the independence, participation, care, self-fulfillment and dignity of older persons, and regional and national efforts, it does not exist by now a recognised framework for securing their rights. Therefore, the DHDR constitutes a very interesting contribution for enforcing the rights of the elderly.

==DHDR Chapter 10: Work, quality of life and standard of living==

The DHDR Chapter 10 complements the system of duties and responsibilities related to the [[right to work]], quality of life and [[standard of living]]. For doing that, the DHDR take into account at the same time, the responsibility of the States and the shared responsibility of the world community in the context of the global interdependence.

The DHDR Article 35 formulates the duty and responsibility to promote the right to justly remunerated work, following considerately the UDHR Article 23. Measures such adopting policies designed to promote productive work; ensuring employment security, in particular protection against arbitrary or unfair dismissal; and ensuring equality of opportunity and conditions of work, are proposed by the DHDR.

The DHDR Article 36 emphasises the postponed duty and responsibility to promote quality of life and an adequate standard of living for all. Although in the UDHR Article 22 it states the States obligation of fulfilling “the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality”, today our interdependent world is not free from hunger and there is not universal access to adequate food and clean water for everyone. The DHDR reiterates the shared responsibility for eradicating extreme poverty from the world, in particular if we consider the sufficiency of material resources for meeting this challenge. Similarly, but with a more pragmatic approach, the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (2000) establishes an intergovernmental agreement for realising globally human rights. These transitional goals indicate indubitably the correct course for implementing human rights in a continuous process with measurable criteria. However, it would be positive to promote a dialogue on the achievement and evolution of the achievement of those goals with the help of this systematised view on universal duties and responsibilities.

==DHDR Chapter 11: Education, arts and culture==

The DHDR Chapter 11 is dedicated to formulate duties and responsibilities on the promotion of education, arts and culture, major topics of the UNESCO, such as the programmes “education for all” and its various instruments for securing adequate conditions for education and artistic and cultural activities.

The DHDR Article 37 enunciates the duty and responsibility to promote and enforce the [[right to education]], taking into account that illiteracy still affects millions of people in the developing countries and that is coincident with the already referred [[Millennium Development Goals]].

The DHDR Article 38 emphasises the duty and responsibility to foster arts and culture by the States and the global community in general, similarly to the UNESCO statements.

==Declaration of Human Duties and Responsibilities Chapter 12: Right to a remedy==

The DHDR finishes with the Chapter 12 dedicated to the right to a remedy where a human right or fundamental freedom is threatened or has been violated.

The DHDR Article 39 enunciates the duty and responsibility, primarily of the States, to provide for and enforce effective national judicial, administrative, legislative and other [[Legal remedy|remedies]] for these cases, in similarity with the UDHR Article 8.

This Chapter proposes, finally, in article 40 the duty to monitor and implement the Declaration of Human Duties and Responsibilities, by establishing tripartite councils composed of State, civil society and private sector representatives in cooperation with States, relevant civil society organisations, national, regional and international inter-governmental organisations,.

The DHDR Article 41 with a non-derogation clause where it states: “Nothing in this Declaration shall be interpreted as impairing or restricting the rights contained in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and other international and regional human rights instruments.”

An '''eCourt''' or '''Electronic Court''', (sometimes written as ECourt, or e-Court) is a location in which matters of law are adjudicated upon, in the presence of qualified Judge or Judges, which has a well-developed technical infrastructure.  This infrastructure is usually designed to allow parties, participants and other stakeholders to better operate some administrative and procedural aspects of the court’s functions, such as presenting evidence, filing judicial records ([[electronic court filing]]) or receiving testimony remotely.

Often referred to as a paperless court, its objective is, in part, to reduce the reliance on paper or hard-copy documents during the judicial process.  But on a larger scale it is usually implemented to increase the efficiency of the court by expediting the access to information.

[[International Criminal Court|The International Criminal Court]] in [[The Hague]] is often cited as a good example of an eCourt.

The '''Edict of Milan''' ({{lang-la|Edictum Mediolanense}}) was the February 313 AD agreement to treat Christians benevolently within the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="Frend"&gt;Frend, W. H. C. ''The Early Church'' SPCK 1965, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Western Roman Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]], who controlled the Balkans, met in [[Milan]] and, among other things, agreed to change policies towards Christians&lt;ref name="Frend"/&gt; following the [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]] issued two years earlier in [[Serdica]]. The Edict of Milan gave Christianity a legal status, but did not make Christianity the [[State church of the Roman Empire]]; this took place under Emperor [[Theodosius I]] in 380 AD with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]].

The document is found in [[Lactantius]]' ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' and in [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s [[Church History (Eusebius)|''History of the Church'']] with marked divergences between the two.&lt;ref name="ODCC-EoM"&gt;Cross and Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' 1974 art. '''Milan, Edict of.'''&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not there was a formal 'Edict of Milan'&amp;thinsp; is debated by some.&lt;ref name="Frend"/&gt;

The version found in Lactantius is not in the form of an edict.&lt;ref name="ODCC-EoM"/&gt; It is a letter from Licinius to the governors of the provinces in the Eastern Empire he had just conquered by defeating [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]]&lt;ref name="NE"&gt;Stevenson, J. ''A New Eusebius'' SPCK 1965, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; later in the same year and issued in Nicomedia.&lt;ref name="Frend"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:ImperialpalaceMilan.jpg|thumb|300 px|Remains of the Imperial palace of Mediolanum (Milan). The imperial palace (built in large part by [[Maximian]], colleague of [[Diocletian]]) was a large complex with several buildings, gardens, and courtyards, used for the Emperor's private and public activities, and for his court, family, and imperial bureaucracy.]]
Ever since the fall of the [[Severan dynasty]] in 235 AD, rivals for the imperial throne had bid for support by either favouring or [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecuting Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;Frend, W.H.C. ''The Early Church'' SPCK 1965, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The previous [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]] had been recently issued by the emperor [[Galerius]] from [[Serdica]] and was posted at [[Nicomedia]] on 30 April 311. By its provisions, the Christians, who had "followed such a caprice and had fallen into such a folly that they would not obey the institutes of antiquity", were granted an indulgence.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, J. ''A New Eusebius'' SPCK 1965, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Wherefore, for this our indulgence, they ought to pray to their God for our safety, for that of the republic, and for their own, that the commonwealth may continue uninjured on every side, and that they may be able to live securely in their homes.}}

Their confiscated property, however, was not restored until 313, when instructions were given for the Christians' meeting places and other properties to be returned and compensation paid by the state to the current owners:&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Ecclesiastical History'' 5.15–17&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|the same shall be restored to the Christians without payment or any claim of recompense and without any kind of fraud or deception.}}

It directed the provincial magistrates to execute this order at once with all energy so that public order may be restored and the continuance of divine favour may "preserve and prosper our successes together with the good of the state."

The actual letters have never been retrieved. However, they are quoted at length in [[Lactantius]]' ''On the Deaths of the Persecutors'' (''De mortibus persecutorum''), which gives the Latin text of both Galerius's Edict of Toleration as posted at Nicomedia on 30 April 311 and of Licinius's letter of toleration and restitution addressed to the governor of Bithynia and posted at Nicomedia on 13 June 313.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De mortibus persecutorum'' 34.1–35.1, 48.1–12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eusebius]] of Caesarea translated both documents into Greek in his ''History of the Church'' (''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]''). His version of the letter of Licinius must derive from a copy posted in the province of [[Palaestina Prima]] (probably at its capital, [[Early centers of Christianity#Caesarea|Caesarea]]) in the late summer or early autumn of 313, but the origin of his copy of Galerius's Edict of 311 is unknown since that does not seem to have been promulgated in Caesarea. In his description of the events in Milan in his ''[[Life of Constantine]]'', Eusebius eliminated the role of Licinius, whom he portrayed as the evil foil to his hero Constantine.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The Edict was in effect directed against [[Maximinus Daia]], the Caesar in the East who was at that time styling himself as Augustus. Having received the emperor Galerius' instruction to repeal the persecution in 311, Maximinus had instructed his subordinates to desist, but had not released Christians from prisons or virtual death-sentences in the mines, as Constantine and Licinius had both done in the West.&lt;ref name="Stevenson, J. 1965, p. 297"&gt;Inscription printed in Stevenson, J. ''A New Eusebius'' SPCK 1965, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Galerius' death, Maximin was no longer constrained; he enthusiastically took up renewed persecutions in the eastern territories under his control, encouraging petitions against Christians. One of those petitions, addressed not only to Maximin but also to Constantine and Licinius, is preserved in a stone inscription at Arycanda in Lycia, and is a "request that the Christians, who have long been disloyal and still persist in the same mischievous intent, should at last be put down and not be suffered by any absurd novelty to offend against the honour due to the gods."&lt;ref name="Stevenson, J. 1965, p. 297"/&gt;

The Edict is popularly thought to concern only Christianity, and even to make Christianity the official religion of the Empire (which recognition did not actually occur until the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380). Indeed, the Edict expressly grants religious liberty not only to Christians, who had been the object of special persecution, but goes even further and grants liberty to all religions:

{{quote|text=When you see that this has been granted to [Christians] by us, your Worship will know that we have also conceded to other religions the right of open and free observance of their worship for the sake of the peace of our times, that each one may have the free opportunity to worship as he pleases; this regulation is made that we may not seem to detract from any dignity of any religion.|sign="Edict of Milan"|source=Lactantius, ''On the Deaths of the Persecutors (De Mortibus Persecutorum)'', ch. 48. opera, ed. 0. F. Fritzsche, II, p 288 sq. (''Bibl Patr. Ecc. Lat.'' XI).&lt;ref&gt;And similarly in [http://wadsworth.com/history_d/special_features/ilrn_legacy/wawc1c01c/content/wciv1/readings/eusebius.html Eusebius].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since Licinius composed the Edict with the intent of publishing it in the east{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} upon his hoped-for victory over Maximinus, it expresses the religious policy accepted by Licinius, a pagan, rather than that of Constantine{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}, who was already a Christian. Constantine's own policy went beyond merely tolerating Christianity: he tolerated paganism and other religions, but he actively promoted Christianity.

==Religious statement==
Although the Edict of Milan is commonly presented as Constantine’s first great act as a Christian emperor, it is disputed whether the Edict of Milan was an act of genuine faith. The document could be seen as Constantine's first step in creating an alliance with the Christian God, who he considered the strongest deity.&lt;ref&gt;Sordi, Marta. ''The Christians and the Roman Empire.'' Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1994. p134.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, he was concerned about social stability and the protection of the empire from the wrath of the Christian God: in this view, the Edict could be a pragmatic political decision rather than a religious shift. However, the majority of historians believe that Constantine's conversion to Christianity was genuine, and that the Edict of Milan was merely the first official act of Constantine as a dedicated Christian. This view is supported by Constantine's ongoing favors on behalf of Christianity during the rest of his reign. &lt;ref&gt;Maier, Paul L. ''Eusebius: The Church History''. Grand Rapids: Kegel Publications, 1999. p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Edict of Milan required that the wrong done to the Christians be righted as thoroughly as possible; it claims “it has pleased us to remove all conditions whatsoever.”&lt;ref name="fordham.edu"&gt;"Paul Halsall, “Galerius and Constantine: Edicts of Toleration 311/313,” Fordham University; [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/edict-milan.asp Fordham.edu]; Internet, accessed 13 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The edict further demanded that individual Romans right any wrongs towards Christians, claiming that “the same shall be restored to the Christians without payment or any claim of recompense and without any kind of fraud or deception.” These provisions indicate that more than just the establishment of justice was intended. After demanding the immediate return of what was lost by the Christians, the edict states that this should be done so that “public order may be secured”, not for the intrinsic value of justice or the glory of God.&lt;ref name="fordham.edu"/&gt; The exhortation to urgently right wrongs reflects the leaders' desires to avoid unfavorable consequences, which in this case included social unrest and further conquests. Constantine was superstitious and believed enough in the existence of the non-Christian gods to not want to offset the balance of good and evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Yuri Koszarycz |title=Constantinian Christianity |publisher=The Online Reference Book for Medieval Studies |url=http://www.the-orb.net/textbooks/eccles/constantine.html |website=The-orb.net |access-date=14 October 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215120014/http://www.the-orb.net/textbooks/eccles/constantine.html |archivedate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that, the sooner this balance was restored by the Romans establishing a state of justice with the Christians, the sooner the state would become stable.

The [[Law French]] phrase '''''en ventre sa mere''''' (literally "in womb its mother", corruption of the original French ''en ventre de sa mère'' "in the womb of its mother") refers to a [[fetus]] [[in utero]]. It is commonly used in [[Legal English]].

An unborn fetus, which is thus still "en ventre sa mere", may be accepted to be a beneficiary for some purposes,&lt;ref&gt;[https://thelawdictionary.org/en-ventre-sa-mere/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; provided it is subsequently born alive. Such a fetus is treated as born if it thereby takes a direct benefit.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Salaman'' (1908) 1 Ch 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the class closing rules generally in ''Hawkins on the Construction of Wills'' 5th edition 2000 chap 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of this concept in legal language can be traced to English cases in the nineteenth century. In ''[[Occleston v Fullalove]]'' (1873-74) L.R. 9 Ch. App. 147, a case heard in the [[Court of Appeal in Chancery]] it was argued for the [[Appellant]] that although the child in question was "en ventre sa mère" at the date of the [[Will (law)|will]] subject to the [[litigation]], there was neither [[principle]] nor [[authority]] against such a child having a reputation of [[Paternity (law)|paternity]]. The [[Court]] allowed the [[after-born child]] to share with her sisters under the will.

The concept is used in [[common law]] [[jurisdictions]] and has been extended beyond the law of wills and [[Inheritance|succession]] so that claims in the law of [[torts]] are also recognised. In the Australian case ''[[Watt v. Rama]]'' [1972] VR 353 it was deemed that a [[fetus]] is a person entitled, once born, to [[Damages|compensation]] as a [[plaintiff]] for injury caused while ''en ventre sa mère''.

Some U.S. cases have removed the requirement that the fetus actually be born. In ''[[Amadio v. Levin]]'', 509 Pa. 199 (1985), the [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]] held that "it makes no difference in liability under the wrongful death and survival statutes whether the child dies of the injuries just prior to or just after birth." In ''[[Farley v. Sartin Trucking]]'', 195 W.Va. 671, the [[Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia]] did away with a requirement that a [[tortiously]] killed fetus be viable outside the womb at the time the tort was committed. The deceased unborn child's personal representative may maintain an action pursuant to the state's wrongful death statute, the court held, cautioning that the cause of action does not extend against a woman who has a legal abortion.

In current spoken [[French language|French]], the phrase would now be rendered as "dans le ventre de sa mère".

'''''Erven Warnink B.V. v. J. Townend &amp; Sons (Hull) Ltd.''''', [1979] AC 731, [1980] R.P.C. 31, &amp;ndash; also known as the '''[[Advocaat]] case''' &amp;ndash; is a leading decision of the [[House of Lords]] that further developed the [[common law]] [[tort]] of extended [[passing off]] for the Commonwealth as originally established in ''[[Bollinger v. Costa Brava]]''. Prior to this case "collective goodwill", as required for an action in passing off, only applied to names indicating geographic origin. The Court held that wares whose name falsely suggests its character or quality can be prevented from selling the product under that name.

==Background==
Warnink was one of the primary market producers of a Dutch [[liqueur]] made from a blend of hen egg yolks, aromatic spirits, sugar, and brandy, which it sold under the name "Advocaat". Townend produced a similar alcoholic drink but using egg and [[Cypriot wine|Cyprus wine]] which it sold as "Keeling's Old English Advocaat".

The Court held that Townend was passing off their goods as those of Warnink. In applying the test for passing off, the Court developed what is known as the "extended" tort of passing off which included any situation where goodwill is likely to be injured by a misrepresentation.

[[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Lord Diplock]] established five criteria for a claim of extended passing off. There must be:
# misrepresentation
# by a trader in the course of trade
# to prospective customers of his or ultimate consumers of goods or services supplied by him,
# which is calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another trader, and
# which causes actual damage to the business or goodwill of the trader bringing the action.

"'''Eye of the Beholder'''" is a song by the American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Metallica]]. It was released as the second single from their fourth studio album, ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'' released on October 30, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metallica.com/releases/eye-of-the-beholder.asp|title=Eye of the Beholder release date|publisher=Metallica.com|accessdate=August 15, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117113854/http://www.metallica.com/releases/eye-of-the-beholder.asp|archivedate=January 17, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lyrically, the song concerns imposed limitations on [[freedom of speech]] and freedom of expression in general. "Eye of the Beholder" is notable for its chorus section containing 12/8 time played, not as an ordinary compound quadruple time, but as a [[syncopated]] rhythm. The rest of the song is a more conventional [[4/4 time|4/4]] [[rhythm]] at a slower [[tempo]] than that seen on Metallica's previous three albums.

The song has not been performed live in its entirety since 1989. It has, however, always formed part of the [[List of musical medleys|medleys]] of songs from ''…And Justice for All'' often played by the band in concert during the 1990s as an alternative to playing full songs, many of which were seen as too difficult because of the numerous guitar parts. One such "Justice Medley" was featured on its 1993 live album ''[[Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://metallica.com/songs/34651/eye-of-the-beholder |title=Eye of the Beholder |website=Metallica.com |date= |accessdate=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version of the song also appears on the remastered edition of In Flames' first EP, ''[[Subterranean (album)|Subterranean]]''. A cover of the song also appeared on the ''[[Metallic Attack: Metallica - The Ultimate Tribute]]'' tribute album, performed by Life After Death, a band formed by Phil Sandoval after the break-up of [[Armored Saint]].

A '''referendum on becoming a republic''' was held in [[Greece]] on 13 April 1924.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p830 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It followed the catastrophic outcome of the [[Asia Minor Campaign]]. As a result of the military defeat, [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] was forced to abdicate (27 September 1922) in favor of his son, [[George II of Greece|King George II]]. King George himself later went into exile in [[Romania]], the home of his wife, while the government debated the fate of the monarchy. Ultimately, a plebiscite was called. This referendum, following the restoration of Constantine I in 1920, reflected the see-saw nature of the Greek electorate and the then-present dominance of the [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal]] and Republican [[Venizelism|Venizelists]] in Greek politics and abolished the Crown. Prime Minister [[Alexandros Papanastasiou]] favoured the vote for the Republic, while [[Eleftherios Venizelos|Venizelos]] kept a neutral stance.

On 25 March 1924 the [[Second Hellenic Republic]] was proclaimed.

A '''gross receipts tax''' or '''gross excise tax''' is a [[tax]] on the total gross revenues of a company, regardless of their source. A gross receipts tax is similar to a [[sales tax]], but it is levied on the seller of goods or service consumers. This is compared to other taxes listed as separate line items on billings, are not directly included in the listed price of the item, and are not a factor in markup or profit on company sales. A gross receipts tax has a pyramid effect that increases the actual taxable percentage as it passes through the product or service life-cycle.&lt;ref name="aiaks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiaks.org/members/committees/govaff/gactax.html |title=Gross Receipts Tax |publisher=AIA Kansas |date=1995-11-17 |accessdate=2007-02-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929024348/http://www.aiaks.org/members/committees/govaff/gactax.html |archivedate=2006-09-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Economists have criticized gross receipts taxes for encouraging [[vertical integration]] among companies and imposing different effective tax rates across different industries.&lt;ref name="tfstudy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/2061.html|title=Tax Pyramiding: The Economic Consequences of Gross Receipts Taxes|publisher=Tax Foundation|last=Chamberlain|first=Andrew|author2=Fleenor, Patrick|date=2006-12-01|accessdate=2007-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
Several [[U.S. state|states]] in the [[United States]] have imposed gross receipts taxes.

*[[Alabama]] - Per Article 3 of the code of Alabama,&lt;ref name="Alabama"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/alcode/40/21/3|title=Alabama Code - Article 3: UTILITY GROSS RECEIPTS TAX|publisher=State of Alabama}}&lt;/ref&gt; the state has imposed this type of tax on most utilities.
*[[Delaware]] - Business and occupational gross receipts tax rates range from 0.096% to 1.92%, depending on the business activity.&lt;ref name="delaware"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.de.us/revenue/services/Business_Tax/Step4.shtml|title=Gross Receipts Taxes|publisher=State of Delaware|date=2006-06-14|accessdate=2007-02-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225185704/http://www.state.de.us/revenue/services/Business_Tax/Step4.shtml|archivedate=2007-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Florida]] - A tax of 2.5% is imposed on "gross receipts from the sale, delivery, or transportation of natural gas, manufactured gas, or electricity to a retail consumer in Florida," referring to utility companies (suppliers of electrical power).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dor.myflorida.com/dor/taxes/grt_utility.html|publisher=Florida Dept of Revenue|accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hawaii]] - Hawaii imposes its General Excise Tax (GET) as a gross receipts tax on all business done in Hawaii, at 0.5% for wholesaling and manufacturing, 0.15% for insurance commissions, and 4% (4.5% in Honolulu county) for all other activities. Businesses may pass on the GET as a sales-tax-like surcharge but are not required to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tax Facts 37-1|url=http://files.hawaii.gov/tax/legal/taxfacts/tf2015-37-1.pdf|website=Hawaii Department of Taxation|accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Illinois]] - Illinois policy makers are considering a 1% gross receipts tax to increase the foundation level for Illinois public schools, as well as to fund a host of educational accountability initiatives.  The tax is expected to generate enough revenue to replace the state share of the retail sales tax, corporate franchise taxes, and corporate income taxes.  Proponents claim that it is simple for both the government and business to administer, easy for the public to understand, broad-based, stable, and progressive.  An editorial article in the ''Chicago Tribune'' called it "the best idea" for education funding reform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-0702090337feb09,1,3738803.story?coll=chi-opinionfront-hed|title=The war of the 'woulds'|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=2007-02-09|accessdate=2007-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some statewide business leaders have rushed to condemn it.
*Nevada - Gross receipts tax adopted in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://taxfoundation.org/nevada-approves-commerce-tax-new-tax-business-gross-receipts|title=Nevada Approves Commerce Tax, A New Tax on Business Gross Receipts - Tax Foundation|date=2015-06-08|newspaper=Tax Foundation|access-date=2017-02-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department|New Mexico]] - The gross receipts tax rate varies throughout the state from 5.125% to 8.6875% with local option taxes imposed at the city and county levels, added to the statewide base tax rate of 5%.&lt;ref name="newmexico"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tax.state.nm.us/oos/GrossReceiptsTaxFAQ.pdf |title=Gross Receipts Taxes |publisher=State of New Mexico |accessdate=2007-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331014708/http://www.tax.state.nm.us/oos/GrossReceiptsTaxFAQ.pdf |archivedate=2007-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ohio]] - Commercial Activity Tax (CAT)[http://www.tax.ohio.gov/commercial_activities.aspx]
*[[Pennsylvania]] - Either 5% or 5.9% for most applicable industries. Tax stands at 1% for private bankers, and the tax on [[natural gas]] was repealed during the industry's deregulation.&lt;ref name="pennsylvania"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revenue.state.pa.us/revenue/cwp/view.asp?A=11&amp;Q=36886 |title=Revenue: Gross Receipts Tax |publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Revenue |date=2005-02-15 |accessdate=2009-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811041306/http://www.revenue.state.pa.us/revenue/cwp/view.asp?A=11&amp;Q=36886 |archivedate=August 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these states, [[Texas]] has a "[[State_income_tax#Corporate_income_tax|margin tax]]" on certain corporate net revenues.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in the [[Helvetic Republic]] on 25 May 1802.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=ch011802 Helvetic Republic (Switzerland), 25 May 1802: Constitution] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the constitution [[Helvetic Republic constitutional referendum, 1798|approved in 1798]], the new constitution, known as the Malmaison constitution, did not provide for any referendums.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; Non-voters were assumed to have voted in favour of the new constitution, a measure put in place to prevent its rejection.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; As a result, 72.17% of voters were deemed to be in favour.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

{{Distinguish|Industrial Relations Commission}}
The '''Industrial Commission''' was a [[United States government]] body in existence from 1898 to 1902. It was appointed by President [[William McKinley]] to investigate [[railroad]] pricing policy, industrial concentration, and the impact of [[immigration]] on [[labor market]]s, and make recommendations to the President and [[Congress of the United States|Congress]]. McKinley and the Commissioners launched the [[trust-busting]] era. The Industrial Commission included McKinley's [[Ohio]] [[running mate]], Commissioner [[Andrew L. Harris]] (a Governor of Ohio and [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[General]]) who served as Chair of the Agriculture Subcommittee, and prominent [[United States Senate|Senator]]s and [[United States House of Representatives|Congressmen]]. After McKinley was [[assassination|assassinated]] in 1901, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] heeded the advice of the Commissioners and further regulated the large trusts.

In the United Kingdom, the '''Investigatory Powers Tribunal''' ('''IPT''') is a [[judicial]] body, independent of the [[British Government|British government]], which hears complaints about [[surveillance]] by public bodies—in fact, "the only Tribunal to whom complaints about the Intelligence Services can be directed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ipt-uk.com/sections.asp?sectionID=22&amp;type=top|title = What the Tribunal can investigate|date = |accessdate = 6 July 2014|website = Investigatory Powers Tribunal|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It was established in 2000 by the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] (RIPA) and replaced the Interception of Communications Tribunal, the Security Service Tribunal, and the Intelligence Services Tribunal.

The IPT does not disclose its address; it uses a [[Post-office box|PO box]] in [[Nine Elms]], [[London]], close to the [[SIS Building|Secret Intelligence Building]]. Its website was created in 2003 by Tricorn Media, which has worked extensively for the police and [[Home Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tricornmedia.com|title=Tricorn Media Ltd (Data Analysis - Business Intelligence - Application Development)|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whois.com/whois/ipt-uk.com|title=Whois ipt-uk.com|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPT and its shortcomings were discussed in a BBC Radio 4 ''[[File on 4]]'' programme in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03bdsyk|title=BBC Radio 4 - File on 4, Secrecy and Surveillance|work=BBC|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain [[European Court of Human Rights]] judgments said the IPT offers no human rights remedy on surveillance questions, in particular Burden v United Kingdom (2008) 47 EHRR 38 and Malik v United Kingdom (Application no.32968/11) [2013] ECHR 794 (28 May 2013).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Jurisdiction==
The Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider complaints about the use of surveillance by any organisation with powers under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. It is also the only judicial body with the power to investigate the conduct of the [[MI5|Security Service]] (MI5), the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6) and the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipt-uk.com/default.asp?sectionID=1|title=What the Tribunal can investigate|publisher=Investigatory Powers Tribunal|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/part/IV/crossheading/the-tribunal|title=Section 65(2)(a) and 65(3)(a) of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000|publisher=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisations under the IPT's jurisdiction must provide details to the IPT of any activity that is being complained about.&lt;ref name="Procs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipt-uk.com/default.asp?sectionID=4|title=Procedures|publisher=Investigatory Powers Tribunal|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPT will only decide whether any surveillance that is being carried out is lawful—i.e., that it has been appropriately authorised and is being conducted in accordance with the applicable rules. If it investigates a complaint and finds that surveillance is being carried out but is lawful, it will not confirm to the complainant that they are under surveillance, merely state that their complaint has not been upheld. The IPT is exempt from the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] so information made available to it in the course of considering a complaint cannot be obtained under a [[Freedom of information in the United Kingdom|freedom of information]] request.&lt;ref name="Limits"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipt-uk.com/default.asp?sectionID=2|title=Limitations|publisher=Investigatory Powers Tribunal|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipt-uk.com/default.asp?sectionID=FAQ&amp;Q=3|title=FAQ: Will the Tribunal tell me if my phone has been intercepted?|publisher=Investigatory Powers Tribunal|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complaints may be dealt with on paper or by oral hearing, at the IPT's discretion.&lt;ref name="Procs"/&gt;

A complaint about surveillance being conducted by a private person or a company cannot be heard by the IPT.&lt;ref name="Limits"/&gt;

There is no avenue to appeal, other than to take the case to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Tribunal report|url=http://www.ipt-uk.com/section.aspx?pageid=28|publisher=The Investigatory Powers Tribunal|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
The IPT's ten members are appointed by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen]] for five-year terms, after which they may "stand down or declare themselves available for reappointment".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ipt-uk.com/sections.asp?sectionID=7&amp;type=side|title = Structure of the Tribunal|date = 6 July 2014|accessdate = |website = Investigatory Powers Tribunal|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The President and Vice President must both hold or have previously held senior [[judge|judicial]] posts. The current President is [[Michael Burton (judge)|Michael Burton]], a member of the [[High Court of England and Wales]], who was Vice President of the IPT since its inception in 2000 before being appointed as President in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ipt-uk.com/sections.asp?sectionID=7&amp;chapter=2&amp;type=side|title = Mr Justice Burton (President)|date = |accessdate = 6 July 2014|website = Investigatory Powers Tribunal|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; All the other members must be experienced [[barrister]]s or [[solicitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipt-uk.com/default.asp?sectionID=7|title=Structure of the Tribunal|publisher=Investigatory Powers Tribunal|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2014, they are:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* ''President'', Mr Justice Michael Burton
* ''Vice President'', Mr Justice Philip Sales
* Mr Robert Seabrook QC
* Sir Anthony Holland
* Ms Susan O’Brien QC
* Mr Charles Flint QC
* The Hon. Christopher Gardner QC
* Professor Graham Zellick CBE QC
* His Honour Geoffrey Rivlin QC
* Mrs Justice Sue Carr

==Cases==
Only select IPT rulings are published. Statistics concerning complaints dealt with by the IPT are published each year in the Annual Report of the [[Interception of Communications Commissioner]]. Those statistics shows that very few complaints about surveillance have been upheld; from 2000 to 2009, five out of at least 956 complaints have been upheld, as shown in the table below.

One of the IPT's few published rulings concerns the high-profile case of a family who were placed under surveillance by [[Poole Borough Council]] in order to investigate claims that the family were not living in the [[school catchment area]] which they claimed. The IPT ruled that the use of covert surveillance by the Council was not appropriate.&lt;ref name="Poole"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipt-uk.com/docs/Paton_v_Poole_Borough_Council.pdf|title=Paton v Poole Borough Council, IPT/09/01-05/C|publisher=Investigatory Powers Tribunal|date=29 July 2010|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poole council loses school catchment 'spying' tribunal|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-10839104|accessdate=19 January 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the IPT produced an annual report for the first time. The report provided statistics relating to the outcomes of complaints. It was stated that 210 complaints were considered in 2010 (including some carried over from the previous year) but 105 (50%) of these cases were inadmissible and were not investigated. This includes cases which were withdrawn, malformed, out of time, out of jurisdiction or, most commonly, "frivolous or vexatious". Sixty-five cases were considered by the IPT to be frivolous or vexatious—generally either obviously unsustainable or repeats of previous complaints.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipt-uk.com/docs/IPTAnnualReportFINAL.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the IPT provided statistics relating to the number of new complaints received and those considered over the course of the year, but did not specify whether any had been upheld.&lt;ref&gt;http://ipt-uk.com/sections.asp?pageID=83&amp;sectionID=18&amp;type=news&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures by Edward Snowden]] in 2013, the British government submitted documents to the Tribunal which showed for the first time that its intelligence services could access raw material collected in bulk by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), and other foreign spy agencies, without a warrant. This appeared to contradict assurances given in July 2013 by the [[Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament|Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee]] which stated that in all cases in which GCHQ obtained intelligence from the US a warrant was signed by a minister.&lt;ref name=refISC20130717&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on GCHQ’s Alleged Interception of Communications under the US PRISM Programme|url=https://b1cba9b3-a-5e6631fd-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/independent.gov.uk/isc/files/20130717_ISC_statement_GCHQ.pdf|publisher=Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament|accessdate=17 December 2013|date=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ball |first=James |title=GCHQ views data without a warrant, government admits |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/29/gchq-nsa-data-surveillance|accessdate=6 November 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2014, official documents disclosed to the IPT by the intelligence agencies revealed that their guidance policies allowed staff to access confidential communications between lawyers and their clients. This [[Legal professional privilege in England and Wales|privileged relationship]] is usually strictly protected under British law, and leading campaigners{{Who|date=March 2016}} said the disclosures had "troubling implications for the whole British justice system". The release of the documents resulted from a claim brought on behalf of two Libyan men who had sued the British government for alleged complicity in their detention and subsequent [[Extraordinary rendition|rendition]] to the Libyan authorities. The British government refused to make a full statement concerning the revelations contained in the documents, saying only that it did not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29939192|title= MI5, MI6 and GCHQ 'spied on lawyers'|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=6 November 2014 |website=BBC News |accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The IPT ruled in December 2014 that GCHQ did not breach the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], and that its activities are compliant with Articles 8 (right to privacy) and 10 (freedom of expression) of the European Convention of Human Rights.&lt;ref name="refBBC141206"/&gt; However, in February 2015, the Tribunal refined its earlier judgement and ruled that aspects of the data-sharing arrangement that allowed UK Intelligence services to request data from the US surveillance programmes [[PRISM (surveillance program)|Prism]] and [[Upstream collection|Upstream]] did contravene said Articles and, as such, were illegal between – at least - 2007, when Prism was introduced, and 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK-US surveillance regime was unlawful ‘for seven years’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/06/gchq-mass-internet-surveillance-unlawful-court-nsa|accessdate=12 February 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when two paragraphs of additional information, providing details about the procedures and safeguards, were disclosed to the public in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPT Ruling on Interception|url=http://www.gchq.gov.uk/press_and_media/news_and_features/Pages/IPT-Ruling-on-Interception-Feb-2014.aspx|publisher=GCHQ|accessdate=6 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206205536/http://www.gchq.gov.uk/press_and_media/news_and_features/Pages/IPT-Ruling-on-Interception-Feb-2014.aspx|archivedate=6 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GCHQ censured over sharing of internet surveillance data with US|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-31164451|accessdate=6 February 2015|publisher=BBC|date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the IPT ruled that the legislative framework in the United Kingdom does not permit mass surveillance and that while GCHQ collects and analyses data in bulk, it does not practice mass surveillance.&lt;ref name=refBBC141206&gt;{{cite news|title=GCHQ does not breach human rights, judges rule|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30345801|accessdate=6 December 2014|publisher=BBC|date=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPT rejects assertions of mass surveillance |url=http://www.gchq.gov.uk/press_and_media/news_and_features/Pages/IPT-rejects-assertions-of-mass-surveillance.aspx |publisher=GCHQ |accessdate=7 February 2015 |date=5 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206232713/http://www.gchq.gov.uk/press_and_media/news_and_features/Pages/IPT-rejects-assertions-of-mass-surveillance.aspx |archivedate=6 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of judgments |url=http://www.ipt-uk.com/section.aspx?pageid=8 |publisher=Investigatory Powers Tribunal |accessdate=7 February 2015 |date=5 December 2014 |quote=1.

{{main|Land tenure}}
Even before the [[Norman Conquest]], there was a strong tradition of landholding in [[Anglo-Saxon law]]. When [[William the Conqueror]] asserted sovereignty over [[England]] in 1066, he confiscated the property of the recalcitrant English landowners. Over the next dozen years, he granted land to his lords and to the dispossessed Englishmen, or affirmed their existing land holdings, in exchange for [[fealty]] and promises of military and other services. At the time of the [[Domesday Book]], all land in [[England]] was held by someone, and from that time there has been no [[allodial]] land in [[England]]. In order to legitimise the notion of the Crown's paramount lordship, a legal fiction - that all land titles were held by the King's subjects as a result of a royal grant - was adopted.

Most of these [[tenant-in-chief|tenants-in-chief]] had considerable land holdings and proceeded to grant parts of their land to their subordinates. This constant process of granting new tenures was known as [[subinfeudation]]. It created a [[feudal system|complicated pyramid of feudal relationships]]. (see also [[Lord of the manor]]).  At the bottom of the feudal pyramid were the tenants who lived on and worked the land (called the [[tenant in demesne|tenants in demesne]] and also the tenant paravail). In the middle were the lords who had no direct relationship with the King, or with the land in question - referred to as [[mesne lord]]s.

Land was granted in return for various "services" and "incidents". A service was an obligation on the part of the tenant owed to the landlord. The most important were payment of rent ([[socage|socage tenure]]), military service ([[Knight-service]]), the performance of some form of religious service ([[frankalmoin]]) and personal/official service, including in times of war ([[Serjeanty|serjeanty tenure]]). 

Incidents, on the other hand, were rights conferred on the lord over the tenant's land or the tenant's person that arose in certain circumstances, most commonly on the death of the tenant. An important incident was that of [[escheat]], whereby the land of the tenant by knight service would escheat to the Crown in the event either of there being no heirs, or the knight's being convicted of a felony.

== Spatial fragmentation of proprietary interests ==
The concept of land tenure has been described as a "spatial fragmentation of proprietary interests in land". No one person could claim absolute ownership of a parcel of land, except the Crown. Thus the modern concept of "[[ownership]]" is not helpful in explaining the complexity of the distribution of rights. In relation to a particular piece of land, a number of people had rights: first, the tenant in demesne with possessory rights; second the mesne lord to whom the tenant owed services; third, a tenant in chief to whom the mesne lord owed services; and finally the Crown who received services directly from the tenant in chief.

== Decline of land tenure ==
The feudal system in England gradually became more and more complex until eventually the process became cumbrous and services difficult to enforce. As a result, the statute of [[Quia Emptores]] was passed in 1290 to replace subinfeudation with substitution, so the subordinate tenant transferred their tenure rather than creating a new subordinate tenure. As tenancies came to an end, the number of layers in the feudal pyramid was reduced. The [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660]] abolished knight service, converting all free tenures to [[socage|socage tenure]]. 

Quia Emptores and its equivalents do not apply to [[lease]]s and [[life estate]]s. In essence, lease of land to a tenant is a form of subinfeudation (unless the lease is granted by the Crown).

== Surveys of land ownership ==
The main two official surveys undertaken in the British Isles with the aim of identifying owners of land and land values are the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 and the [[Return of Owners of Land, 1873]].

{{Jainism}}
'''[[Jainism]]''' is considered to be a '''legally distinct [[religion]] in India'''. A section of scholars earlier considered it as a [[Hindu denominations|Hindu sect]] or a [[Buddhist]] [[heresy]], but it is one of the three ancient Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Jainism|quote=Along with Hinduism and Buddhism, it is one of the three most ancient Indian religious traditions still in existence. …While often employing concepts shared with Hinduism and Buddhism, the result of a common cultural and linguistic background, the Jain tradition must be regarded as an independent phenomenon. It is an integral part of South Asian religious belief and practice, but it is not a Hindu sect or Buddhist heresy, as earlier scholars believed |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9105858/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 January 2014, the Government of India explicitly awarded the status of a "[[Ministry of Minority Affairs|minority religion]]" to the Jain community in India, as per Section 2(c) of the [[National Commission for Minorities]] (NCM) Act (NCM), 1992.&lt;ref name=hindu14/&gt;

==History of Jain demand for minority status==
* The Jain demand for minority status is almost a century old, when in British India the Viceroy and Governor General of India, Lord Minto took a decision in principle of giving representation to important minorities in the Central Legislature. Seth Manek Chand Hirachand from Mumbai, an eminent Jain leader from Mumbai and the then Acting President of the Bharatvarshiya Digamber Jain Sabha made an appeal in 1909 to the Governor General for the inclusion of the Jain community for representation in the Council.&lt;ref&gt;[[Manabendra Nath Roy]] (June 1999 reprint) ''The Radical Humanist'' vol 63, no. 3, p. 29 [https://books.google.com/books?id=agJuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Seth+Manekchand++Hirachand&amp;dq=Seth+Manekchand++Hirachand&amp;ei=gdGbSfTqGYS6kQTjqv3lCQ&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt; Seth Manek Chand's petition was transferred to the Government of Bombay and the Secretary to the Government of Bombay stated in his reply dated 15 October 1909 as follows:
::"I am directed to inform you that a number of seats have been reserved for representation of minorities by nomination and that in allotting them, the claim of the important Jain Community will receive full consideration. "
* In a Memorandum by the Representative of the Jain Community to the Constituent Assembly in March/April 1947 a strong appeal was made for the inclusion of the Jain community as a minority religious community.
* In his speech on 3 September 1949, Jawahar Lal Nehru said: No doubt India has a vast majority of Hindus, but they could not forget in fact there are also minorities Muslims, Christians, Parsis and Jains. If India were understood as Hindu Rashtra it meant that the minorities were not cent per cent citizens of the country:
* Jainism is mentioned as a religion along with Buddhism and Sikhism in explanation II of the Article 25 of the India Constitution relating to Fundamental Right to religions freedom. On this issue Jawahar Lal Nehru, the then prime Minister, in his letter dated 31.01.1950 assured a Jain Deputation that they need not have any misgivings on this clear constitutional position.
* The second stanza of [[Jana Gana Mana]], Indian National Anthem clearly enunciates Jainism as a separate religious denomination in line with Hinduism, Islam and other religions.&lt;ref&gt;Aharaha tava ahvāna prachārita, śuni tava udāra vāni,'''Hindu-Bauddha-Śikha-Jaina-Pārasika-Musalmāna-Khristāni''', Purava-paścima-āse tava singhāsana pāse, Prema-hāra haya gāmthā, Jana gana aikya vidhāyaka jaya he bhārata bhāgya vidhāta, Jaya he, jaya he, jaya he, jaya jaya jaya jaya he!&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Indian Supreme Court in 2005 ruled that Jains, Sikhs and Buddhist are part of broader Hindu fold, as they are Indic religions and interconnected to each other, although they are distinct religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050811/nation.htm#1|title=Jains, Sikhs part of broader Hindu religion, says SC S.S. Negi Legal Correspondent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recommendation of National Minorities Commission===

In 1993, the National Minorities Commission arrived at their recommendation that the Jain community be declared as a minority religious community.&lt;ref&gt;National Minorities Commission - notification dated 23-10-1993&lt;/ref&gt; It was in consideration of the following:
*the relevant constitutional provisions,
*various judicial pronouncements,
*the fundamental differences in philosophy and beliefs (theism vs.atheism principally) vis-a-vis Hinduism, and
*the substantial number of Jain population in the country.
It resolved to recommend to the Government of India that the Jains deserve to be recognised as a distinct religious minority, and that, therefore the Government of India may consider including them in the listing of "Minorities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Status of Jain Community | work = Ministry of Minority Affairs, Rajya Sabha | publisher = Press Information Bureau, Government of India | date = 7 May 2007 | url = http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=27576 | accessdate = 2008-09-11 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bal Patil Judgement==
{{See also|Bal Patil}}
In 2005, the [[Supreme Court of India]] declined to issue a [[writ of Mandamus]] towards granting Jains the status of a religious minority throughout India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://googlecrawl.securities.com/googlecrawler/?pc=IN&amp;doc_id=97181108 |title=Are Jains Not In Minority? Think Again |author=KN Goyal|publisher= Hindustan Times |date=13 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court however left it to the respective [[States and territories of India|states]] to decide on the minority status of Jain religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20051125/edit.htm#4 |title=Minority rights are indivisible|author=Syed Shahabuddin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the observations of the Supreme Court, not forming part of the judgment, the Court said:&lt;ref&gt;Appeal (civil)  4730 of 1999, [http://www.rishabhdara.com/sc/view.php?case=20276 Bal Patil &amp; Anr. v. Union of India &amp; Ors.] [[Indian Supreme Court]] Decided on 08/08/2005&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Thus, '[[Hinduism]]' can be called a general religion and common faith of India whereas '[[Jainism]]' is a special religion formed on the basis of quintessence of Hindu religion. Jainism places greater emphasis on non-violence ('[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]]') and compassion ('[[Karuṇā|Karuna]]'). Their only difference from Hindus is that Jains do not believe in any [[creator deity|creator]] like [[God in Jainism|God]] but worship only the perfect human-being whom they called [[Tirthankara|Tirthankar]]. Lord [[Mahavira|Mahavir]] was one in the generation of Thirthankars. The Tirathankars are embodiments of perfect human-beings who have achieved human excellence at mental and physical levels. In philosophical sense, Jainism is a reformist movement amongst Hindus like [[Brahmo Samaj|Brahamsamajis]], [[Arya Samaj|Aryasamajis]] and [[Lingayatism|Lingayats]]. The three main principles of Jainism are Ahimsa, [[Anekantavada|Anekantvad]] and Aparigrah.}}

The Supreme Court also noted: " … that the State Governments of [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Uttarakhand]] have already notified Jains as 'minority' in accordance with the provisions of the respective State Minority Commissions Act."&lt;ref&gt;[para 7 of the Bal Patil Judgment]&lt;/ref&gt;

This cast a doubt on the independent standing of Jain religion. Scholars in the Jain tradition, as well as several groups amongst the Jain community protested, and emphasised that Jain religion stands as a religion in its own right. While Hinduism as a mode of living, and as a culture is to be found across various religions in India because of several common customs, traditions and practices, but as religions Hindu religion and Jain religion are distinct.

==2014: National minority status granted==
On 20 January 2014, the [[Government of India]] awarded the minority status to the Jain community in India, as per Section 2(c) of the [[National Commission for Minorities]] (NCM) Act (NCM), 1992. This made the Jain community which makes for 7 million or 0.4 percent of the population as per 2001 census, the sixth community to be designated this status as a "national minority", after Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsis. Though Jains already had minority status in 11 states of India including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, in 2005 a petition was filed with Supreme Court of India, by community representatives, which was also backed by the National Minorities Commission. In its judgement the court left the decision to the Central government.&lt;ref name=hindu14&gt;{{cite web | title = Jains granted minority status|publisher=The Hindu| url =http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jains-granted-minority-status/article5598368.ece |date=21 January 2014| accessdate = 2014-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Eye on votes, UPA gives Jain community minority status|publisher= Hindustan Times

====Jawaharlal Nehru====
[[File:PMO letter to Jains.jpg|thumb|250px|Prime Ministers letter to jain delegation]]

On 3 September 1949, while addressing a public meeting at [[Allahabad]], the first Prime Minister of India, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] said:&lt;ref&gt;Jawaharlal Nehru's speech reported in the English daily newspaper ''The Statesman'' dated 5 September 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

:"No doubt India has a vast majority of Hindus, but they could not forget the fact that there were also minorities - Muslims, Parsis, Christians, Sikhs and Jains. If India was understood as a Hindu Rashtra, it meant that the minorities were not cent percent citizens of this country."

The said speech can be considered to be a clarification on Article 25 of the Constitution of India.

10.2 On 31 January 1950, the PPS to the then Prime Minister of India sent a letter to the Jain Deputation on behalf of the then Prime Minister, which reads as under: (See adjoining image for original letter)
:"With reference to the deputation of certain representatives of the Jains, who met the Prime Minister on the 25 January 1950, I am desired to say that there is no cause whatever for the Jains to have any apprehensions regarding the future of their religion and community. Your deputation drew attention to Article 25, explanation II of the Constitution. This explanation only lays down a rule of construction for the limited purpose of the provision in the article and as you will notice, it mentions not only of Jains but also Buddhists and the Sikhs. It is clear therefore, there is no reason for thinking that Jains are considered to be Hindus. It is true that Jains in some ways closely linked to Hindus and have many customs in common, but there can be no doubt that they are a distinct religious community and constitution does not in any way affect this well recognized position.
:Yours faithfully,
:Sd.
:A.V. Pai
:Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister"

10.5 Jawaharlal Nehru, in his book ''[[Discovery of India]]'', mentioned as under:
:"Buddhism and Jainism were certainly not Hinduism or even the Vedic Dharma. Yet they arose in India and were integral parts of Indian life, culture and philosophy. A Buddhist or Jain, in India, is a hundred per cent product of Indian thought and culture, yet neither is a Hindu by faith. It is, therefore, entirely misleading to refer to Indian culture as Hindu culture."

====Dr. S. Radhakrishnan====

10.3 Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, the former [[President of India]], in his book "Indian Philosophy Vol I" mentioned as under:
:"The Bhagawat Purana endorses the view that [[Rishbha]]deva was the founder of Jainism. There is evidence to show that so far back as the first century B.C. there were people who were worshipping Rishabhadeva, the first Tirthankara. There is no doubt that Jainism prevailed even before Vardhamana Mahaveera or [[Parsvanatha]]. The Yajurveda mentions the names of three Tirthankaras-Rishabh, Ajitnath &amp; Aristanemi."

15. Dr. Radhakrishnan, who edited the 6th Volume of The Cultural Heritage of India, mentioned as under:
:"The Jains claim a great antiquity for their religion. Their earliest prophet was Rishabhdeva. Who is mentioned even in the Vishnu and Bhagawat Puranas as belonging to a very remote past. In the earliest Brahmanic literature are found traces of the existence of a religious Order."

=="Freedom of Religion Bill" controversy in Gujarat==

The '''Freedom of Religion Bill''' was a controversial bill passed by the [[Gujarat]] state assembly. The bill was passed in 2003. An amendment to the bill was passed on 19 September 2006 which banned the forced conversion from one religion to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; The Anti-Conversion Act passed earlier was not clear on what forced conversion meant and to whom should it apply. Under the amendment Bill, a person need not seek permission in case he/she is converting from one sect to another of the same religion. It clubbed Jainism and Buddhism as denominations of Hinduism, like Shia and Sunnis are of Islam or Catholicism and Protestantism of Christianity. The move evoked strong protests from the state's [[Jain]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Christian]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Commission for Minorities]] also criticised the  Gujarat Assembly's decision to club Jainism and Buddhism with Hinduism terming it to be in contravention of its 23 October 1993, notification classifying Buddhists as a "minority community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.hindu.com/2006/09/21/stories/2006092102951200.htm| title =National Commission for Minorities criticises Gujarat decision | publisher = The Hindu| date =21 September 2006| accessdate =2008-09-11}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately on 31 July 2007, finding it not in conformity with the concept of freedom of religion as embodied in Article 25 (1) of the Constitution, Governor [[Nawal Kishore Sharma]] returned the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; The Governor  held that Jainism and Buddhism are recognised as religions rather than denominations of Hinduism, something that the Amendment Bill sought to wrongly convey. A press release issued by [[Raj Bhavan (Gujarat)|Raj Bhavan]], said "the proposed amendment would amount to withdrawing the protection against forceful or inappropriate religious conversions, particularly in case of Jains and Buddhists". The release cited large scale protests from different religious and social organisations, especially from the Jain and Christian communities, in indicating toward the unacceptability of the proposed amendment.

==Chronological order of various court judgments on Jainism as a separate religion==

#1927 - In 1927 Madras High Court in Gateppa v. Eramma and others reported in AIR 1927 Madras 228  held that "Jainism as a distinct religion was flourishing several centuries before Christ".  Jainism rejects the authority of the Vedas which form the bedrock of Hinduism and denies the efficacy of the various ceremonies which Hindus consider essential.
#1939 - In Hirachand Gangji v. Rowji Sojpal reported in AIR 1939 Bombay 377, it was observed that "Jainism prevailed in this country long before Brahmanism came into existence and held that field, and it is wrong to think that the Jains were originally Hindus and were subsequently converted into Jainism."
#1951 - A Division Bench of the Bombay High Court consisting of Chief Justice Chagla and Justice Gajendragadkar in respect of Bombay Harijan Temple Entry Act, 1947 (C.A. 91 of 1951) held that Jains have an independent religious entity and are different from Hindus.
#1954 - In The Commissioner Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt reported in AIR 1954 SC 282 this Court observed that there are well known religions in India like Buddhism and Jainism which do not believe in God, in any Intelligent First Cause.  The Court recognised that Jainism and Buddhism are equally two distinct religions professed in India in contrast with Vedic religion.
#1958 - In well known Kerala Education Bill's case, 1957  reported in AIR 1958 SC 956,  this Court held that to claim the minority rights, the Community must be numerically a minority by reference to the entire population of the State or country where the law is applicable.  In that way also, the Jain Community is eligible for the claim.
#1968 - In Commissioner of Wealth Tax, West Bengal v. Smt. Champa Kumari Singhi &amp; Others reported in AIR 1968 Calcutta 74, a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court observed that "Jains rejected the authority of the Vedas which forms the bedrock of Hinduism and denied the efficacy of various ceremonies which the Hindus consider essential.  It will require too much of boldness to hold that the Jains, dissenters from Hinduism, are Hindus, even though they disown the authority of the Vedas".
#1976 - In Arya Samaj Education Trust, Delhi &amp; Others v. The Director of Education, Delhi Administration, Delhi &amp; Others reported in AIR 1976 Delhi 207, it was held as follows: "Not only the Constitution but also the Hindu Code and the Census Reports have recognised Jains to belong to a separate religion." In the said judgement, the Court referred to the observations of various scholars in this behalf. The Court quoted Heinrich Zimmer in "Philosophies of India" wherein he stated that "Jainism denies the authority of the Vedas and the orthodox traditions of Hinduism.  Therefore, it is reckoned as a heterodox Indian religion".   The Court also quoted [[J. N. Farquhar]] in ''Modern Religious Movements in India'' wherein he stated that "Jainism has been a rival of Hinduism from the beginning". In the said judgment, in conclusion, the Court held that "for the purpose of Article 30(1), the Jains are a minority based on religion in the Union Territory of Delhi".
#1993 - In A.M. Jain College v. Government of Tamil Nadu (1993) 1 MLJ 140, the Court observed that it is also an admitted fact that the Jain community in Madras, Tamil Nadu is a religious and linguistic minority.
#2005 - [[Supreme Court of India ]] gave verdict that Jainism, [[Sikhism]] (and [[Buddhism]]) are distinct religions, but are inter-connected and inter-related to [[Hinduism]], so these three are part of wider broader Hindu religion, based on the historic background on how the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] had come into existence after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jains, Sikhs part of broader Hindu religion, says SC |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050811/nation.htm#1|author=S.S.

'''''Lemon v. Kurtzman''''', 403 U.S. 602 (1971),&lt;ref name=lemon&gt;{{ussc|name=Lemon v. Kurtzman|volume=403|page=602|pin=|year=1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a case argued before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. The court ruled in an 8–1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970/89 |title=Lemon v. Kurtzman |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Oyez |publisher= |access-date=November 1, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; decision that [[Pennsylvania]]'s Nonpublic Elementary and Secondary Education Act (represented through [[David Kurtzman]]) from 1968 was unconstitutional, violating the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. The act allowed the Superintendent of Public Schools to reimburse private schools (mostly [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]]) for the salaries of teachers who taught in these private schools, from public textbooks and with public instructional materials. The decision also upheld a decision of the [[United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island]], which had struck down the Rhode Island Salary Supplement Act providing state funds to supplement salaries at private elementary schools by 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=DiCenso v. Robinson |vol=316 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=112 |pinpoint= |court=D.R.I. |date=1970 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/316/112/1951443/ |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in Pennsylvania, most of these funds were spent on Catholic schools.

==Lemon test==
The Court's decision in this case established the "'''Lemon test'''" (named after the lead plaintiff [[Alton Lemon]]),&lt;ref name="NYTObitAL"&gt;{{cite news |last=Liptak |first=Adam |date=2013-05-26 |title=Alton T. Lemon, civil rights activist, dies at 84 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/us/alton-t-lemon-civil-rights-activist-dies-at-84.html?smid=pl-share |newspaper=[[The New York Times|New York Times]] |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which details legislation concerning [[religion]]. It is threefold:

# ''The statute must have a secular legislative purpose. (Also known as the Purpose Prong)''
# ''The principal or primary effect of the statute must not advance nor inhibit religion. (Also known as the Effect Prong)''
# ''The statute must not result in an "excessive government entanglement" with religion. (Also known as the Entanglement Prong)''
#: Factors.
## Character and purpose of institution benefited.
## Nature of aid the state provides.
## Resulting relationship between government and religious authority.

If any of these prongs are violated, the government's action is deemed unconstitutional under the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

The act stipulated that "eligible teachers must teach only courses offered in the public schools, using only materials used in the public schools, and must agree not to teach courses in religion." Still, a three-judge panel found 25% of the State's elementary students attended private schools, about 95% of those attended Roman Catholic schools, and the sole beneficiaries under the act were 250 teachers at Roman Catholic schools.

The court found that the parochial school system was "an integral part of the religious mission of the Catholic Church," and held that the Act fostered "excessive entanglement" between government and religion, thus violating the Establishment Clause.&lt;ref name=lemon/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Held: Both statutes are unconstitutional under the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment, as the cumulative impact of the entire relationship arising under the statutes involves excessive entanglement between government and religion.&lt;ref name=lemon/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later use==

Conservative Justices, such as [[Clarence Thomas]] and [[Antonin Scalia]], have scrutinized the application of the ''Lemon'' test.&lt;ref name="LambsChapel"&gt;{{ussc|name=Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School District|volume=508|page=384|pin=398|year=1993|dissent=Scalia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The test was compared to a "ghoul in a late night horror movie" by Justice Scalia in ''[[Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School District]]'' (1993).&lt;ref name="LambsChapel"/&gt; 

The Supreme Court itself has applied the ''Lemon'' test in ''[[Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe]]'' (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe|volume=530|page=290|pin=|year=2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while in ''[[McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union]]'' (2005) the court did not overturn the ''Lemon'' test, even though it was urged to do so by the petitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union|link=|volume=545|page=844|pin=|year=2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The test was also central to ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Kitzmiller v. Dover]]'', a 2005 [[intelligent design]] case before the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Kitzmiller v.

The [[Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals]] applied the test in ''[[Int'l Refugee Assistance Project v.

This is a '''list of [[multilateral environmental agreement|international environmental agreements]]'''.

Most of the following agreements are legally binding for countries that have formally ratified them. Some, such as the [[Kyoto Protocol]], differentiate between types of countries and each nation's respective responsibilities under the agreement. Several hundred international environmental agreements exist but most link only a limited number of countries. These bilateral or sometimes trilateral agreements are only binding for the countries that have ratified them but are nevertheless essential in the international environmental regime. Including the major conventions listed below, more than 3,000 international environmental instruments have been identified by the [[Canada Research Chair in international political economy|Canada Research Chair in International Political Economy]] in its TIPEA project&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/en/ongoing-projects&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''list of parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women''' encompasses the states who have signed and ratified or acceded to the international agreement to prevent discrimination against women.

On December 18, 1979, the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]  was opened for signature. [[Sweden]] became the first state to deposit the treaty on July 2, 1980. The treaty [[coming into force|came into force]] and closed for signature on September 3, 1981 with the ratification of 20 states. Since then, states that did not sign the treaty can now only accede to it. The instrument of ratification, accession, or succession is deposited with the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]].

As of May 2015, 189 states have ratified or acceded to the treaty, most recently [[South Sudan]] on April 30, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en Member States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823144158/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |date=2012-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[United States]] and [[Palau]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1109/S00763/palau-takes-lead-in-empowering-women.htm|title=Palau takes lead in empowering women - Scoop News|website=www.scoop.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; have signed but not ratified the treaty. The [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) has also ratified the treaty in its legislature, but is unrecognized by the [[United Nations]] and is a party to the treaty only unofficially.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1524">In employment law, a '''Loudermill letter''' is a letter that public-sector employers may send to employees giving notice of their intent to suspend, demote, or terminate.

According to [[Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill]], the process that is due a public employee includes a pre-termination hearing that provides "oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story."  The Loudermill letter fulfills the requirement of (written) notice, and should include an explanation of the employer's evidence ("to act as a check for mistaken accusations"). To fulfill the remaining [[Due Process]] requirements, a Loudermill letter will also have to inform the employee of his opportunity for a [[Loudermill hearing]].

==Content of the letter==

The formal letter advising the employee that discipline is being considered, and offering the opportunity for the employee to discuss or present his or her version and mitigating evidence, may be the first time the employee is even aware that certain allegations have arisen or that an investigation has been concluded.

The letter usually states that the employee may contact his union representative. The governing contract language may also state that the union representative will receive a copy of the letter

'''''Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd''''' has become an important case in New Zealand as a result of the [[leaky homes crisis]]. The salience of the case comes from the fact that [[Michael Hardie Boys|Justice Hardie Boys]] held the directors of a building company personally liable for damage caused by defective foundations.&lt;ref&gt;''Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd'' [1984] 2 NZLR 548 at 548.&lt;/ref&gt; The case has been described in the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]] as one that, "certainly provides some authority for the view that the directors of a building company with actual control of particular building operations owe a duty of care, associated with that control."&lt;ref&gt;''Body Corporate 202254 v Taylor'' [2009] 2 NZLR 17 at 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Between 1976 and 1977 Douglas Homes Ltd built four flats in a residential subdivision in [[Waimairi County]], [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] over the top of an old shingle pit.&lt;ref&gt;''Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd'' [1984] 2 NZLR 548 at 554.&lt;/ref&gt; Before construction, "the directors had been advised by an engineer on the work necessary for the laying of foundations for two flats. One of the directors did not ensure that the engineer’s advice was adhered to in the construction of the foundations of one flat. The other director specifically took charge of the works on the other, and failed to ensure the engineer’s advice was followed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.thornton.net.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/In_Pursuit_of_the_directors.pdf|title = In pursuit of the directors|last = Thornton|first = Michael|date = 13 April 2007|journal = NZLawyer|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
Hardie Boys J reasoned that the directors of Douglas Homes Ltd could be held liable for their negligence as, "The principle of limited liability protects shareholders and not directors, and a director is as responsible for his own torts as any other servant or agent."&lt;ref&gt;''Trevor Ivory Ltd v Anderson'' [1992] 2 NZLR 517 at 547.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardie Boys J held that in establishing whether a director owed a duty of care the test was to be that established in ''[[Anns v Merton LBC|Anns v Merton London Borough Council]]'' [1978] AC 728 and that a duty of care was founded upon the control a director exercised over the operations of a company.
 
{{Cquote|The relevance of the degree of control which a director has over the operations of the company is that it provides a test of whether or not his personal carelessness may be likely to cause damage to a third party, so that he becomes subject to a duty of care. It is not the fact that he is a director that creates the control, but rather that the fact of control, however derived, may create the duty. There is therefore no essential difference in this respect between a director and a general manager or indeed a more humble employee of the company. Each is under a duty of care, both to those with whom he deals on the company's behalf and to those with whom the company deals in so far as that dealing is subject to his control.|author=Hardie Boys J|source=''Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd'''&lt;ref&gt;''Trevor Ivory Ltd v Anderson'' [1992] 2 NZLR 517 at 548.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Significance==
The ratio has not yet been overturned and as such remains a precedent for holding directors liable for defects in construction that was under their control. In 2006 in ''Dicks v Hobson Swan Construction Limited (in liquidation),'' [[David Baragwanath|Justice Baragwanath]] applied the ratio of the case to hold a director personally liable for a [[Leaky homes crisis|leaky building]] constructed by his company.&lt;ref&gt;''Dicks v Hobson Swan Construction Limited (in liquidation)''  HC Auckland CIV 2004-404-1065, 20 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2010 appeal from the Weathertight Homes Tribunal Justice Wylie noted the correct approach to searching for directorial liability lay through the test articulated in ''Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd'';

{{Cquote|...it should have asked itself whether the elements of the tort of negligence were made out against each of [the directors]. In doing so, it should have borne in mind the presumption against the imposition of personal responsibility where the director was simply acting on behalf of the company. It should have asked itself whether the director assumed personal liability for the relevant conduct. The degree of control test articulated by Hardie Boys J in Morton is likely to be of considerable help in answering that question.|author=Wylie J|source=''Chee v Stareast Investment Limited'''&lt;ref&gt;''Chee v Stareast Investment Limited'' HC Auckland CIV 2009-404-005255, 1 April 2010 at [113].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Newlands Labor Act''', was a 1913 United States federal law, sponsored by Senator [[Francis G. Newlands]] of Nevada and drafted by [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] Commissioner [[Charles Patrick Neill]]. It created the [[Board of Mediation and Conciliation]] (BMC). The BMC was a precursor to today's [[National Mediation Board]] (NMB).

==Background==
In response to railroad strikes during the 1870s and 1880s,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the ''Arbitration Act of 1888,'' which authorized the creation of [[arbitration]] panels with the power to investigate the causes of labor disputes and to issue non-binding arbitration awards.&lt;ref&gt;Arbitration Act of 1888, {{USStat|25|501}}, October 1, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was a complete failure: only one panel was ever convened under the Act, and that one, in the case of the 1894 [[Pullman Strike]], issued its report only after the strike had been crushed by a [[United States district court|federal court]] [[injunction]] backed by federal troops.

Congress attempted to correct these shortcomings in the [[Erdman Act]], passed in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Erdman Act of 1898, June 1, 1898, ch. 370, {{USStat|30|424}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This law likewise provided for voluntary arbitration, but made any award issued by the panel binding and enforceable in federal court. It also outlawed discrimination against employees for union activities, prohibited "yellow dog" contracts (employee agrees not to join a union while employed), and required both sides to maintain the status quo during any arbitration proceedings and for three months after an award was issued. The arbitration procedures were rarely used.

==Newlands Act and the BMC==
President [[Woodrow Wilson]] signed the Newlands Act on July 15, 1913.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Newlands Act, July 15, 1913, ch. 6, 38 Stat. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The law created the Board of Mediation and Conciliation, which was administered by U.S. Commerce and District Court Judge [[Martin Augustine Knapp]] and assisted by U.S. Alabama District Court Judge and Commissioner [[William Lea Chambers]]. The Board adjusted and arbitrated disputes between railroad companies and their operating employees, where those disputes threatened to interrupt operation of the carriers to the "serious detriment of the public interest." Voluntary arbitration was also provided for those disputes that could not be settled by [[mediation]].

The Board was functionally replaced on December 26, 1917, by the creation of the [[United States Railroad Administration]], although it continued to exist with its activities restricted to [[short-line railroad]]s. In 1920, the [[Esch–Cummins Act]] (formally called the ''Transportation Act'') created a new [[Railroad Labor Board]] which regulated wages and settled disputes, and permanently replaced the duties of the BMC.&lt;ref&gt;Esch–Cummins Act, Pub.L. 66-152, {{USStat|41|456}}. Approved 1920-02-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 1926, [[United States Congress|Congress]] repealed the Newlands Labor Act and Title III of the Esch–Cummins Act (which pertained to labor disputes), with the enactment of the [[Railway Labor Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Railway Labor Act, {{USStat|44|577}}. Approved 1926-05-20. {{USC|45|151}} et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study is notable as the first documentation that the [[OARDEC]] convened multiple Tribunals for some captives when their original Tribunals determined they should not have been classified as [[enemy combatants]]. It generally gained a finding of enemy combatant status on the second hearing, but some panels resisted.

The Denbeaux represent two detainees at Guantánamo Bay.

==The study==
The report was based upon information given by lawyers for 102 Guantanamo detainees and transcripts of the tribunals, which were released by the government under a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] lawsuit filed by the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref name=VillageVoice2006-12-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=MsNbc20061117/&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo20061130&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Three chairs were reserved for members of the press, but only 37 of the 574 Tribunals were observed.]]
{{main|Combatant Status Review Tribunal}}
Following the United States Supreme Court's rulings in ''[[Rasul v. Bush]]'' (2004) and ''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]'' (2004), in which it held that foreign detainees and United States citizens had the right of habeas corpus to challenge their detention before an impartial tribunal, the Bush administration developed the process of [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s to serve as tribunals for the detainees. In addition, the process was to fulfill the obligation under [[wikisource:Third Geneva Convention#Article 5|Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention]], to determine if persons were prisoners of war or enemy combatants.

The Article says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Should any doubt arise as to whether persons, having committed a belligerent act and having fallen into the hands of the enemy, belong to any of the categories enumerated in Article 4, such persons shall enjoy the protection of the present Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These hearings were conducted based on the assertion by the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] that detainees in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]] were not eligible for [[prisoner of war]] status according to the terms of [[wikisource:Third Geneva Convention#Article 2|Article 2 of the GCIII]] and therefore designated [[unlawful combatant]]. The Bush administration had contended that the Taliban was not a legal government of Afghanistan and al-Qaeda was a terrorist organization.

The Combatant Status Review Tribunals were held by the [[United States Department of Defense]] between July 8, 2004 through March 29, 2005, to provide an impartial tribunal for detainees to challenge their detention. It was developed as an alternative to detainees' taking habeas corpus petitions through the federal court system. The status of each detainee was reviewed to see if they qualified for detention as an [[enemy combatant]].

In 2006, after the CSRTs were completed, the [[Center for Policy and Research]] at Seton Hall University School of Law published ''No-Hearing Hearings'', its review of the process and outcome for detainees based on publicly available materials, some procured under the [[Associated Press]] [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request. The Center study was based on DOD data, some of which was incomplete.

==Findings in the 2006 report==
''No-Hearing Hearings'' contained the following conclusions:&lt;ref name=VillageVoice2006-12-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=MsNbc20061117/&gt;
* The government did not produce any witnesses in any hearing.
* The military denied all detainee requests to inspect the classified evidence against them.
* The military refused all requests for defense witnesses who were not detained at Guantanamo.
* In 74 percent of the cases, the government denied requests to call even those witnesses who were detained at the prison.
* In 91 percent of the hearings, the detainees did not present any evidence.
* In three cases, the panel found that the detainee was "no longer an enemy combatant," but the military convened new, second tribunals that were told to reconsider the evidence and found each of the three to be enemy combatants.

According to the Associated Press, [[Mark Denbeaux]] said, "These were not hearings. These were shams;" he called the hearings a [[show trial]].&lt;ref name=MsNbc20061117/&gt;

==Comment==

With the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] in mind, Andrew Cohen, the legal commentator of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the actual trials of the detainees are as empty and shallow and pre-ordained as were the Status Review Tribunals there is every reason to be mortified at the prospect -- made real by the legislation -- that the federal courts will be frozen out of vital oversight functions. If a regular trial court proceeding were this shoddy, this unwilling to perform a truth-seeking function, this unable to achieve a fair process, the judge presiding over it would be impeached.&lt;ref name=WaPo20061130/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nat Hentoff opined in the ''[[Village Voice]]'' that the "conditions of confinement and a total lack of the due process that the Supreme Court ordered in '[[Rasul v. Bush]]' and '[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'" makes US government officials culpable for war crimes.&lt;ref name=VillageVoice20061217&gt;

| archivedate=2009-08-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt; His article continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Co-author Joshua Denbeaux tells me: 'The government's own documents proved that the government's claims that the prisoners were the 'worst of the worst' was a false and shameful public relations ploy . . . We hope that our reports will convince Congress to amend the Military Commissions Act and restore federal jurisdiction.' If that happens, the prisoners could contest their conditions of confinement, their imprisonment, and their sentences.&lt;ref name=VillageVoice20061217/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=April 2007}}

'''Open music''' is [[music]] that is shareable, available in "[[source code]]" form, allows derivative works and is free of cost for non-commercial use. It is the concept of "[[open source software|open source]]" computer software applied to music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magnatune.com/info/openmusic Magnatune]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the non-commercial stipulation associated with Open Music is incompatible with the first section of the [[Open Source Software#The Open Source Definition|Open Source Definition]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opensource.org/osd.html&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the first freedom put forth in [[The Free Software Definition]] (freedom 0).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html&lt;/ref&gt; Open Music is one of the general responses to the [[RIAA]]'s and governmental actions against the music industry and its consumers.

"Open music" can be considered a subset of "[[free music]]" (referring to freedom). The differences of philosophy between advocates of "open source software" and  "[[free software]]" have not surfaced in the community of musicians contributing music to the [[copyleft]] commons. This may be due to the relatively recent emergence of copyleft music, as well as to the fact that software development generally involves much more collaboration and derivatization than does music production. It is not clear that open collaboration using copyleft licenses provides any significant advantages in music production, as open source advocates commonly argue is the case for software development.

Several websites have surfaced to provide musicians with the platform and tools necessary for online music collaboration.  Most of these sites promote one or more of the [[Creative Commons]] licenses, allowing derivative works and sharing of the finished songs.  Early implementations of these collaboration sites relied on threaded discussion forum software and FTP to provide a means for musicians to initiate and discuss projects, and to share multi-track files.  More recent and modern sites provide robust project-management features, automatic encoding and compression, online playback streaming, web-based upload and download options, chat, and project-based discussion forums.

There are plenty of artists that use Creative Commons Licenses. One the most open licence is "Creative Commons Attribution" License.

A '''people's court''' in the late [[Soviet Union]] was a [[court of first instance]] which handled the majority of civil and criminal offenses, as well as certain [[administrative law]] offenses.

The people's court handled cases by a collegium consisted of a '''people's judge''' and two '''people's assessors'''. The people's assessors had duties similar to jurors, but decided both any objections and the verdict along with the judge, unlike in most jury systems.

In early [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] and Soviet Union the term "people's court" was used in reference to any court in the new Soviet legal system which replaced the legal system of the [[Russian Empire]]. At these times there were several levels of courts, according to the administrative division of the country: local, ''[[okrug]]'', and ''[[oblast]]'' people's courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gumer.info/bibliotek_Buks/History/Article/dekr_sud2.php "Decree about the Court No. 2"] February 15, 1918 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Reclusión perpetua''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]], from {{lang-la|'''reclusio perpetua'''}}, meaning "permanent imprisonment") is a type of sentence of imprisonment in the [[Philippines]], [[Argentina]], and several other countries.

In the Philippines, it is one of two sentences, the other being [[life imprisonment]], designed to [[capital punishment in the Philippines|replace the death penalty]] and is in legal parlance near-synonymous with [[life imprisonment]]. 

However, there are several important distinctions between the two terms:

* ''Reclusión perpetua'' is prescribed on crimes punishable by the [[Revised Penal Code of the Philippines|Revised Penal Code]], while life imprisonment is imposed on offenses punishable by Special Laws.
* ''Reclusión perpetua'' carries the accessory penalty in which, as defined by Philippine Law, the prisoner is barred for life from holding political office. Life imprisonment does not carry this penalty.
* Unlike life imprisonment, the length of a sentence for ''reclusión perpetua'' is fixed at 40 years and cannot be altered during sentencing.
* ''Reclusión perpetua'' does not allow pardon or [[parole]] until after the first 30 years of the sentence have been served, and after 40 years without pardon or parole, the sentence expires. Life imprisonment does not have any definite extent or duration of imprisonment, and prisoners serving life imprisonment can have parole at any time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3606">'''Restitutio ad integrum''' or '''restitutio in integrum''' is a [[Latin term]] which means restoration to original condition. It is one of the primary guiding principles behind the awarding of [[damages]] in [[common law]] [[negligence]] claims. The general rule, as the principle implies, is that the amount of compensation awarded should put the successful plaintiff in the position he or she would have been had the [[tort]]ious action not been committed. Thus the plaintiff should clearly be awarded damages for '''direct expenses''' such as medical bills and property repairs and the loss of '''future earnings''' attributable to the injury (which often involves difficult speculation about the future career and promotion prospects).

Although monetary compensation cannot be directly equated with physical deprivation it is generally accepted that compensation should also be awarded for '''loss of amenities''', reflecting the decrease in expected standard of living due to any injury suffered and '''pain and suffering'''. Damages awards in these categories are justified by the restitutio principle as monetary compensation provides the most practicable way of redressing the deprivation caused by physical injury.

==Patent law==
{{see also|Restitutio in integrum under the European Patent Convention}}
The expression ''restitutio in integrum'' is also used in [[patent]] law, namely in the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC), and refers to a means of redress available to an applicant or patentee who has failed to meet a time limit in spite of exercising "all due care required by the circumstances" ({{EPC Article|122}}). If the request for ''restitutio in integrum'' is accepted, the applicant or patentee is re-established in its rights, as if the time limit had been duly met.

According to decision G 1/86 of the [[Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office|Enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office]], other parties such as [[Opposition procedure before the European Patent Office|opponent]]s are not barred from the ''restitutio in integrum'' by principle. For instance, if an opponent fails to file the statement of grounds for appeal in spite of all due care, after having duly filed the notice of appeal, ''restitutio'' remedies will be available to him or her.

==Cases==
*''Graham v. Egan'' 15 La. Ann. 97, 98 (1860). In considering whether to give the mortgagor money damages or restore the property itself, the court said in regard to restitution: "He can restore the property itself, and place the [mortgagor] in the same condition he would have occupied if he had not been harassed with an unfounded demand. This is precisely what is meant by the restitution in integrum. If there be ground for restitution at all, there is the same ground for a complete restitution, a restitution in integrum."
*''[[Emile Erlanger v The New Sombrero Phosphate Company]]'' (1877–78) L.R. 3 App. Cas. 1218
*''Livingstone v Rawyards Coal Co'' (1880) 5 App Cas 25,39, per Lord Blackburn, compensation should be "that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured in the same position as he would have been if he had not sustained the wrong for which he is now getting his compensation or reparation."

'''The Russian Organization for Intellectual Property VOIS''' ({{lang-rus| Всероссийская организация интеллектуальной собственности, ВОИС}}) is collective management society for neighboring rights established by Russian performers and labels in 2008.

Today VOIS unites more than 3,500 performers and hundreds of record-labels in different music styles.

In 2009 Rosohrankultura (the Ministry of Culture Department) accredited VOIS as the sole society to collect and distribute remuneration for related rights owners within the territory of the Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;http://rosohrancult.ru/upload/rosohrancult/rosdocs2009/protokol7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It means that only VOIS has the right to act on behalf of an unlimited number of performers and phonogram producers, collect and distribute money to the right-owners.

In everyday activity VOIS concludes contracts with music users both in public sphere and broadcasting.

The main goals of VOIS are:
# To collect the remuneration
# To distribute the remuneration between Russian and foreign right-holders (according with bilateral agreements with foreign collective societies)
# To represent Russian related rightholders abroad

Total amount of collected remuneration in 2012 reached about 531,7 mln. [[Ruble|Rub]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1374470&amp;NodesID=4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Statutory law''' or '''statute law''' is [[written law]] set down by a body of [[legislature]] or by a singular [[legislator]] (in the case of [[absolute monarchy]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]], Art. 1 §1&lt;/ref&gt; This is as opposed to [[oral law|oral]] or [[customary law]]; or [[regulatory law]] promulgated by the [[Executive (government)|executive]] or [[common law]] of the [[judiciary]]. 
[[Statute]]s may originate with national, state legislatures or local [[municipality|municipalities]].

==Codified law==
{{Main|Codification (law)}}
The term '''codified law''' refers to statutes that have been organized ("codified") by subject matter; in this narrower sense, some but not all statutes are considered "codified."  The entire body of codified statute is referred to as a "code," such as the [[United States Code]], the [[Ohio Revised Code]] or the [[Code of Canon Law]]. The substantive provisions of the Act could be codified (arranged by subject matter) in one or more titles of the United States Code while the provisions of the law that have not reached their "effective date" (remaining uncodified) would be available by reference to the [[United States Statutes at Large]]. Another meaning of "codified law" is a statute that takes the [[common law]] in a certain area of the law and puts it in statute or code form.

==Private law (particular law)==
Another example of statutes that are not typically codified is a "private law" that may originate as a [[private bill]], a law affecting only one person or a small group of persons. An example was [[divorce]] in [[Canada]] prior to the passage of the [[Divorce Act, 1968 (Canada)|Divorce Act of 1968]]. It was possible to obtain a legislative divorce in by application to the [[Senate of Canada]], which reviewed and investigated petitions for divorce, which would then be voted upon by the Senate and subsequently made into law. 

In the [[United Kingdom Parliament]], private bills were used in the nineteenth century to create [[corporation]]s, grant [[monopoly|monopolies]] and give individuals attention to be more fully considered by the parliament. The government may also seek to have a bill introduced ''unofficially'' by a [[backbencher]] so as not to create a public scandal; such bills may also be introduced by the [[loyal opposition]] &amp;mdash; members of the opposition party or parties. Sometimes a [[private member's bill]] may also have [[private bill]] aspects, in such case the proposed legislation is called a [[hybrid bill]].

In [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]], private law is called "particular law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3.HTM Canon 13 §1], [[1983 CIC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Terrorism Risk Insurance Act''' (TRIA) ({{USBill|107|H.R.|3210}}, {{uspl|107|297}}) is a [[United States federal law]] signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] on November 26, 2002. The Act created a federal "backstop" for [[insurance]] claims related to acts of [[terrorism]]. The Act  "provides for a transparent system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terrorism Risk Insurance Program|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Pages/program.aspx|work=U.S. Treasury Department Website|publisher=U.S. Treasury Department|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act was originally set to expire December 31, 2005, was extended for two years in December 2005, and was extended again on December 26, 2007.

On January 7, 2015 the House of Representatives voted 416-5 to approve the '''Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015''', ({{USBill|114|HR|26}}, {{uspl|114|1}}) extending the TRIA through the year 2020.

==History==
Before the [[September 11 attacks]], business insurers generally neither charged for nor specifically excluded terrorism coverage. The scope of the 9/11 attacks and the resulting $40 billion estimated insured loss changed perceptions dramatically. It was the worst terrorist attack on record for both property and fatalities and the worst international attack on American soil since the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor]], as nearly 3,000 people lost their lives in [[New York City]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Stonycreek Township]] near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartwig|first=Robert|title=Terrorism Risk: A Reemergent Threat|url=http://www.insureagainstterrorism.org/TerrorismRisk-ReemergentThreat.pdf|publisher=Insurance Information Institute|date=April 2011|accessdate=December 14, 2014|author2=Wilkinson, Claire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924035334/http://www.insureagainstterrorism.org/TerrorismRisk-ReemergentThreat.pdf|archive-date=September 24, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the financial cost from the 9/11 attacks fell on reinsurers (that further spread the risk assumed by primary insurers). Unable to accurately model or price terrorism exposures, reinsurers largely withdrew from the market for terrorism coverage. Without reinsurance, primary insurers were then compelled to exclude terrorism. Most state insurance regulators approved terrorism exclusions for use by primary insurers.

Many businesses were not able to purchase insurance protection against future terrorist attacks. This situation was a serious threat to industries where lenders and investors required terrorism protection for their investments. Real estate, transportation, construction, energy, and utility sectors of the economy were vulnerable, creating broader threats to the national economy.

Congress responded by enacting TRIA in November 2002 to provide a government reinsurance backstop in case of large-scale terrorist attacks, requiring that business insurers offer terrorism coverage for the types of insurance included in the act. Congress extended and amended TRIA in December 2005 and December 2007.

Following enactment of the 2007 TRIA extension, the Congressional Budget Office forecast a net federal budget cost of $0 for TRIA through 2017. "Under TRIA, the federal government would help insurers cover losses in the event of a terrorist attack under certain conditions, and would also impose assessments on the insurance industry to recover all or a portion of the federal payments." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Willie|first=Susan|title=Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate: H.R. 2761: Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act|url=https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=482779|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act expired on December 31, 2014, but was renewed at the start of the next congress, with President Barack Obama signing the extension on January 12, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sddt.com/Construction/article.cfm?SourceCode=20150116czm&amp;_t=TRIA+reauthorized+with+several+tweaks]&lt;/ref&gt; Many experts warn that "construction projects could be stalled and commercial loans on shopping malls, utilities and skyscrapers could be in jeopardy." In addition, according to the [[Baltimore Sun]], the [[National Football League]] denied rumors that it would cancel the [[Super Bowl]] over the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expiring terrorism insurance program alarms Md. industries|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-terrorism-insurance-20141227-story.html#page=1|publisher=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
The Secretary of the Treasury oversees the Terrorism Insurance Program, with the assistance of the Federal Insurance Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission - Federal Insurance Office|url=http://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Pages/Federal-Insurance.aspx|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Secretary has authority to establish regulations and procedures to implement TRIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TRIA Regulations|url=http://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Domestic-Finance/Financial-Institutions/TRIP/Pages/TRIP.aspx|publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of terrorism==
The term "act of terrorism" is defined in the act as: any act certified by the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], in concurrence with the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], to be an act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure and to have resulted in damage within the U.S. (or outside the U.S. in the case of a U.S.-flagged vessel, aircraft or premises of a U.S. mission). It must be committed as part of an effort to coerce U.S. civilians or to influence either policy or conduct of the U.S. Government through coercion. The definition includes both foreign and domestic terrorists. The Secretary may not delegate this certification authority and his or her decision to either certify or not certify an act of terrorism is not subject to judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, As Amended In 2005 and 2007|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Documents/TRIAasamended-CompositeTextPost.pdf|work=U.S. Department of the Treasury Web site|publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury|accessdate=25 March 2013|location=Section 102 (1) Act of Terrorism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
TRIA created a U.S. government reinsurance facility to provide [[reinsurance]] coverage to insurance companies following a declared terrorism event.  TRIA is a short-term measure designed to help the insurance market recover from 9/11 and develop solutions to insuring terrorism.

TRIA established the Federal Terrorism Insurance Program to administer a system of shared public/private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism in order to protect consumers and create transitional period for private insurance markets to stabilize

==Structure of assistance==
*'''Eligibility of Insurers''': An eligible insurer is any entity or affiliate that:
:-Is a recipient of direct earned premiums for any type of commercial property and casualty insurance coverage;
:-Is licensed (or admitted) to provide insurance in any State, approved for the purpose of offering property and casualty insurance by a Federal agency in connection with maritime, energy, or aviation activity, or is a State residual market insurance entity or State workers' compensation fund
:-And meets any other criteria that the Secretary may reasonably prescribe.

*'''Program Trigger''': Program is triggered following occurrence of event determined by Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of State, and the U.S. Attorney General to be act of terrorism. Losses from the act must exceed $50 million in 2006 and $100 million in 2007.
*'''Individual Company Trigger (or Deductible):''' Trigger or deductible for individual company is 17.5 percent of premiums in 2006 and 20% in 2007.
*'''Industry-wide Retention''': The industry as a whole must cover a certain amount of the losses before federal assistance is available. This amount rises from $15 billion in 2005 to $25 billion in 2006 and rises again in 2007 to $27.5 billion. The difference between this amount and the aggregate amount that insurers must pay (deductibles and co-payments) can be recouped from commercial policyholders through a surcharge not to exceed 3 percent of premium for insurance coverages that fall under the TRIEA program. This reinsurance takes the form of a 90 percent quota share in excess of variable deductibles based upon a percentage of earned premium income.
*'''Cap on Assistance''': $100 billion per year
*'''Post Trigger Federal Assistance''': When program is triggered, Federal government is to pay 90% of insured terrorism losses in excess of individual insurer trigger/deductibles while the insurer pays 10%.  In 2007, this rises to 85%/15%.
*'''Recoupment of Assistance''': Recoupment to be through surcharges of up to 3% of annual premiums on all policyholders. Mandatory recoupment for all amounts provided to insurers under industry-wide retention. No mandatory recoupment of uncompensated losses in excess of industry-wide retention. Secretary of the Treasury has discretion to recoup additional amounts.
*'''Covered Lines''': Commercial, plus war coverage for workers' compensation; excludes reinsurance. Secretary of the Treasury has discretion to add group life insurance and other personal lines.
*'''Mandatory Terrorism Coverage''': For the first two years, insurers must offer terrorism insurance in all commercial policies. Coverage must be available on terms identical to terms, amounts, and other coverage limitations applicable to losses incurred from events other than acts of terrorism.
*'''Application to State Residual Market Entities and State Workers Compensation Funds''': Residual market entities and State funds are included in the insurers covered by the Act. The Act also applies to surplus lines carriers listed on the Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers published by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. In addition, captive insurers and other self-insurance arrangements such as workers compensation self-insurance programs and State workers compensation reinsurance pools are included.
*'''Cost Disclosure of Terrorism Coverage''': Insurers must disclose terrorism insurance premiums and the existence of the federal backstop.
*'''Consultation with State Insurance Regulators (NAIC):''' As the Secretary of Treasury determines appropriate, concerning the Terrorism Insurance Program.
*'''State Regulation Uniformity''': No stated uniformity.
*'''Civil Actions and Litigation''': Federal cause of action in district court(s) designated by Judicial Panel on Multi-district Litigation with the substantive law of the state in which the act occurred applied.
*'''Legal Modifications and Limitations''': Punitive damages do not constitute "insured losses" and thus no federal participation. U.S. right of subrogation.
*'''Reports from Insurers''': No reports required, except for data not available to NAIC. Secretary of Treasury responsible for compiling of data.
*'''State Pre-emption''': Applicable to terrorism definition and state prior approval rating statutes. Also applies to existing terrorism exclusions, with provisions for reinstatement under certain conditions. Access to books/records by Secretary of Treasury guaranteed.
*'''Civil Monetary Penalties''': $100 million against insurers for failing to pay assessments or surcharges, erroneous data, or violation of regulations.
*'''Report to Congress''': Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with NAIC, the insurance industry and other experts, is to issue a report not later than June 30, 2005, covering required items.
*'''Satisfaction of Judgments from Assets of Terrorists''': No.

'''''The Golf Specialist''''' is a 1930 [[Comedy film|comedy]] [[short subject]] from [[RKO Pictures]], starring [[W. C. Fields]]. It was his first [[Sound film|talkie]]. The film was shot in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]] when many early [[film studio]]s in [[America's first motion picture industry]] were based there in the early part of the  20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation   | last = Koszarski   | first = Richard   | author-link =    | last2 =    | first2 =    | author2-link =    | title = Fort Lee: The Film Town   | place = Rome, Italy   | publisher = John Libbey Publishing -CIC srl   | year = 2004   | volume =    | edition =    | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5w0r8YKan04C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Fort+Lee:+the+film+town+Door+Richard+Koszarski&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fyO4TcjINoKeOpr32LsP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false   | doi =    | id =    | isbn=  0-86196-653-8    | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web   | last =    | first =    | authorlink =    | coauthors =    | title = Studios and Films   | work =    | publisher = Fort Lee Film Commission   | date =    | url = http://www.fortleefilm.org/studios.html   | doi =    | accessdate = 2011-05-30   | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation   | last = Fort Lee Film Commission   | first =    | author-link =    | last2 =    | first2 =    | author2-link =    | title = Fort Lee Birthplace of the Motion Picture Industry   | place =    | publisher = Arcadia Publishing   | year = 2006   | volume =    | edition =    | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ViR3b72xkK0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Fort+Lee+Birthplace+of+the+Motion+Picture+Industry&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ah3lTdmHMY7rObrH9bIG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false   | doi =    | id =    | isbn = 0-7385-4501-5   | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film features lines such as "I would never hit a woman, not even my own mother" and "Stand clear and keep your eye on the ball", a line Fields also used in the golf scene in ''[[The Dentist (1932 film)|The Dentist]]'' (1932).  Fields reprised the entire golf scene in ''[[You're Telling Me!]]'' (1934).

==Synopsis==
In a Florida hotel, the House Detective's wife ([[Shirley Grey]]) likes to flirt with other men. The House Detective (John Dunsmuir) catches her flirting with a man, and he bodily throws him out.

Deep Sea McGurk ([[William Black (actor)|William Black]]) comes in and asks the Desk Clerk (Johnny Kane) for J. Effingham Bellweather, but he is not in. McGurk dictates a note for the Desk Clerk to give to Bellweather that he wants to collect the money that is owed to him. 

Bellweather ([[W. C. Fields]]) enters, and the Desk Clerk gives him the note from McGurk, which he tears up.  After brief encounters with a bratty little girl (Naomi Casey) and the House Detective (John Dunsmuir), Bellweather offers to teach the Detective's Wife how to play golf.

The two of them and their Caddy (Allen Wood) go out to the golf course, but Bellweather never gets to hit the ball. He is continuously interrupted by such distractions as the incompetent Caddy's squeaking shoes, the wind blowing papers into his path, and accidentally stepping into a [[pie]] that the Caddy had brought.

Finally, the Sheriff and the House Detective come out to the course to arrest [[Confidence trick|con artist]] Bellweather for a list of absurd crimes (including "eating [[spaghetti]] in public", "jumping board bill in seventeen lunatic asylums", "failure to pay installments on a strait-jacket", and "possessing a skunk"); the police put [[handcuffs]] on him just as he's showing the Detective's Wife the importance of keeping the wrists close together while gripping the club.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfm8gR12hA4 ''The Golf Specialist'' (1930)] on YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Wight''' (died ca. 1608&lt;ref&gt;''A Quantitative Analysis of the London Book Trade 1614–1618'', David L. Gants, 
Studies in Bibliography – Volume 55, 2002, pp. 185–213 gives a date of 1605 for Wight's death.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a bookseller, publisher and [[draper]] in London. Wight published many important books, including many of the earliest law books in English.

==Career==
Together with his father, the draper John Wight, he published seven editions of [[William Bourne (mathematician)|William Bourne]]'s book ''A Regiment for the Sea'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Beginnings of Maritime Publishing in England, 1528–1640'', Thomas R. Adams, The Library: Transactions of the Biblioraphic Society, s6-14: 207–220, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Regiment for the sea.'', [[William Bourne (mathematician)|William Bourne]], Imprinted at London: By T. Est, for Thomas Wight, 1592  (log for ships speed, cross-staff, astrolabe.)&lt;/ref&gt; the first purely English navigational text.

By time Wight published Bourne's book, he was primarily a publisher, and became part of a monopoly for printing law books in 1599.  He published many of the first printed  English law books, including Fulbeck (1600), discussing study methods for law students, techniques for arguing a case, and suggestions for further reading. Pulton (1600), also published by Wight the same year, was the first book to attempt to summarise English criminal law. Fulbecke (1602) was one of the first books on international law. Saint German (1604) was first published in Latin in 1523, and attempts to describe English law through a dialogue between a churchman and a student of English common law. It ponders the  nature of law, its religious and moral standards, and jurisdiction of Parliament. Manwood (1598) summarises the laws of the forest, known as ''Carta de Foresta''; this was of key interest to English gentlemen, and  went through numerous reprintings. Kitchin (1598) described [[Court leet|manorial law]], land law, and agrarian law.

Wight published copies of the "[[Year Books|Yearbooks]]", notes by law students which were the earliest English legal reports dating back to the eleventh century.&lt;ref&gt;Holdsworth, ''A History of English Law V'': 357–377; [[John Gage Marvin|Marvin]], ''[[Marvin's Legal Bibliography|Legal Bibliography]]'' (1847) 756. Sweet &amp; Maxwell,  ''[[A Legal Bibliography of the British Commonwealth of Nations]] I'': 311 (3), 312 (14). Pollard and Redgrave, ''Short-Title Catalogue of Books Printed in England, Scotland, and Ireland 9679'', 1479. Catalogue of the Library of the Harvard Law School (1909) II: 976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wight was also a prominent figure in the early discussions of copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;''Press Control and Copyright in the 16th and 17th Centuries'', W. S. Holdsworth, The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 29, No. 8 (Jun. 1920), pp. 841–858&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[Edmund Weaver (publisher)|Edmund Weaver]], another famous London book publisher and bookseller, started as Wight's apprentice, and took over the business when Wight died.

'''Title 51 of the United States Code''' ('''51 U.S.C.'''), entitled '''National and Commercial Space Programs''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher= [[Office of the Law Revision Counsel]] | title=United States Code | access-date=November 21, 2015 | url=http://uscode.house.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the compilation of the general laws regarding space programs. It was [[Promulgation|promulgated]]&lt;ref&gt;According to [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/01/106a- 1 U.S.C. 106a], this is the official term.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] on December 18, 2010 when he signed [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ314/pdf/PLAW-111publ314.pdf PL 111-314] ({{USBill|111|HR|3237}}) into law.

==Background ==
Since the 1940s, many statutes have been enacted relating to national and commercial space programs. In the U.S. Code, some of these statutes are codified in [[Title 15 of the United States Code|Title 15, ''Commerce and Trade'']], [[Title 42 of the United States Code|Title 42, ''The Public Health and Welfare'']] and [[Title 49 of the United States Code|Title 49, ''Transportation'']]. No single title had previously existed in the U.S. Code for space programs, as the Code was established in 1926, before the [[Space Age]].

== Effect ==
Title 51 does not modify or repeal existing programs. Rather, it restates existing law in a manner that adheres to the policy, intent and purpose of the original laws, whilst improving the organizational structure of the law and removing imperfections.

== Codification history ==
Title 51 was prepared by the [[Office of the Law Revision Counsel]] of the [[United States House of Representatives]], in accordance with {{USC|2|285b}}.

{{USBill|111|H.R.|3237}} was introduced on July 16, 2009, and referred to the [[Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives]]. The Committee considered the bill in full committee mark-up on October 21, 2009, and ordered the bill to be reported. The bill was reported by the Committee on November 2, 2009, and passed by the House of Representatives on January 13, 2010. On January 20, 2010, the bill was received in the Senate and referred to the [[Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]. The Committee considered the bill in full committee mark-up on May 6, 2010, and on May 10 it was reported by the Committee without amendment. The bill passed in the Senate by unanimous consent on December 3, and was signed into law by [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] on December 18.

The '''Treaty of Darin''', or the '''Darin Pact''', of 1915 was between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Ibn Saud|Abdul-Aziz Al Saud]] (sometimes called ''Ibn Saud'') ruler of [[Nejd]], who would go on to found the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] in 1932.

==Signing==
The Treaty was signed at Darin, on the [[Tarout Island|island of Tarut]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International Boundaries of Saudi Arabia |last=Abdul-Razzak |first=S. |year=1997 |isbn=978-8172000004 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 26 December 1915 by Abdul-Aziz and [[Percy Cox|Sir Percy Cox]] on behalf of the British Government.&lt;ref name="Abdullah I of Jordan 1950 186"&gt;{{cite book |title=Memoirs |last=[[Abdullah I of Jordan]] |first= |author2=Philip Perceval Graves |authorlink2=Philip Graves  |year=1950 |isbn= |page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms==
The Treaty made the lands of the [[House of Saud]] a British protectorate and attempted to define its boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Arabia's Frontiers: the Story of Britain's Boundary Drawing in the Desert. |last=Wilkinson |first= John C. |year=1993 |isbn= |pages=133–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British aim of the treaty was to guarantee the sovereignty of [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]] and the [[Trucial States]].&lt;ref name= Chaudhry&gt;{{cite book |title=The Price of Wealth: Economics and Institutions in the Middle East |last=Chaudhry |first=Kiren Aziz |year=1997 |isbn=978-0801484308 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdul-Aziz agreed not to attack British protectorates, but gave no undertaking that he would not attack the [[Sharif of Mecca]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Society and State in the Gulf and Arab Peninsula: A Different Perspective |last=Al-Naqeeb |first=Khaldoun Hasan |year=1991 |isbn=978-0415041621 |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, he agreed to enter the war against the [[Ottoman Empire]] (the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I]]) as an ally of Britain.&lt;ref name="Abdullah I of Jordan 1950 186"/&gt;

==Significance==
The Treaty was the first to give international recognition to the fledgling Saudi state. Also, for the first time in Nejdi history the concept of negotiated borders had been introduced.&lt;ref name= Chaudhry/&gt; Additionally, the British aim was to secure its Persian Gulf protectorates, but the treaty had the unintended consequence of legitimising Saudi control in the adjacent areas.&lt;ref name= Chaudhry/&gt; The Treaty was superseded by the [[Treaty of Jeddah (1927)]].

The '''''Venpet''–''Venoil'' collision''' was a [[Collision|maritime accident]] involving sister [[supertanker]]s; the [[Liberia]]n-registered ''Venoil'' and ''Venpet'', in [[Fog|dense fog]] off the coast of [[South Africa]] on 16 December 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Venpet Venoil collision|url=https://incidentnews.noaa.gov/incident/6239|accessdate=20 April 2018|agency=NOAA Incident news|publisher=NOAA|date=16 December 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tankers were travelling in opposite directions; the ''Venoil'' fully laden with over 250,000 [[tonnes]] of [[crude oil]] bound for [[Nova Scotia]] and the ''Venpet'', travelling in [[Sailing ballast|ballast]], headed for [[Kharg Island]], Iran. The ''Venoil'' ploughed into the ''Venpet'', eventually leading to the spilling of approximately 26,600–30,500 tonnes of [[crude oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ships particulars - MT Venpet and MT Venoil collision|url=http://www.aukevisser.nl/supertankers/id320.htm|website=www.aukevisser.nl|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Both tankers were constructed in [[Nagasaki]], Japan by [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries|Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd]], work beginning on the ''Venoil'' in October 1972 and the ''Venpet'' in January 1973.&lt;ref name="Venoil History"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aukevisser.nl/supertankers/id320.htm|title=Venoil History |accessdate=2011-05-05 |publisher=aukevisser.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Venpet History"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aukevisser.nl/supertankers/id323.htm|title=Venpet History |accessdate=2011-05-05 |publisher=aukevisser.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessels were completed in March and June 1973 respectively at the cost of approximately $28m each.&lt;ref name="DISASTERS: The Wreck of the Two Sisters"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919213,00.html|title=DISASTERS: The Wreck of the Two Sisters |accessdate=2011-05-05 |publisher=time.com|date=26 December 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each vessel was more than 330,000 [[deadweight tonnage|deadweight]] (DWT) which, at the time, classified them as [[Oil tanker#Size_categories|Very Large Crude Carriers]] (VLCCs). The current classification for vessels over 300,000 DWT is [[Oil tanker#Size_categories|Ultra Large Crude Carriers]] (ULCC).&lt;ref name="eagle.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Evangelista | first=Joe, Ed. | title=Scaling the Tanker Market | journal=Surveyor | volume= | issue=4 | pages=5–11 | publisher=American Bureau of Shipping |date=Winter 2002 | url=http://www.eagle.org/NEWS/pubs/pdfs/SurveyorWinter02.pdf | accessdate=2011-05-05|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bow of the ''Venoil'' collided into the side of the ''Venpet'', creating a hole {{convert|14|m|ft}} deep and {{convert|55|m|ft}} long.&lt;ref name="DISASTERS: The Wreck of the Two Sisters"/&gt; Both vessels caught fire, but did not explode because of their [[inert gas]] systems – the flames rising {{convert|61|m|ft}} into the air and the resulting smoke visible for up to {{convert|24|km|mi}} around. Both vessels had been travelling at around {{convert|13.5|knot|km/h}}.&lt;ref name="c4tx.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Devanney | first=Jack | title=The Strange History of Tank Inerting| url=http://www.eagle.org/NEWS/pubs/pdfs/SurveyorWinter02.pdf | accessdate=2011-05-05|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devanney|first1=Jack|title=The strange history of tank inerting|url=https://vdocuments.site/documents/history-of-inert-gas-in-tankers.html|website=www.vdocuments.site|publisher=The centre for tankship excellence|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collision occurred approximately {{convert|40|km|mi}} off the southern coast of South Africa between [[Plettenberg Bay]] and [[Cape St. Francis]].  {{Bbl to t|23980}} of [[bunker oil]] from ''Venpet's'' forward fuel tank and {{Bbl to t|170635}} of crude oil from two of ''Venoil's'' storage tanks were spilled, for a total of {{Bbl to t|194615}}, most of which was consumed by the flames; patches of emulsified oil created a {{convert|160|km|mi|adj=on}} wide slick, part of which impacted over {{convert|130|km|mi}} of the South African shoreline from [[Plettenberg Bay]] to [[Stilbaai|Still Bay]].&lt;ref name="CTX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c4tx.org/ctx/job/cdb/precis.php5?key=19771216_001|title=CTX Casualty Database: Venpet| accessdate=2011-05-05 |publisher=c4tx.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another estimate concludes the ''Venpet'' lost {{Bbl to t|31000|API=10.5}}&lt;!--10.5 is the average of the range API 7...14 quoted in the reference--&gt; of bunker fuel oil, and the ''Venoil'' lost {{Bbl to t|155000|API=31}} of heavy crude oil and {{Bbl to t|33000|API=10.5}} of bunker fuel oil, for a total of {{Bbl to t|219000|API=29.5}}&lt;!--29.5 is an artificial value needed to force the template to sum the differing API values correctly --&gt;.&lt;ref name="CTX"/&gt;

The majority of the crew aboard the ''Venoil'' managed to launch a lifeboat; although thirteen men who had been trapped by the flames were rescued by helicopter.&lt;ref name="DISASTERS: The Wreck of the Two Sisters"/&gt; Two men lost their lives in the incident.&lt;ref name="Venoil History"/&gt; Two British merchant ships, the [[bulk carrier]] ''Jedforest'' and the ''Clan Menzies'' rescued the remaining crews of the ''Venoil'' and ''Venpet'' respectively. The vessels were abandoned and initially drifted towards the coast as their fires eventually went out.&lt;ref name="IncidentNews: Venoil"/&gt; They were towed out towards the [[Agulhas Current]] to prevent them grounding on the coastline as well as ensuring that any further release of oil would be carried away from the coastline.&lt;ref name="CTX"/&gt;

The official investigation published in November 1985 by the Liberian marine board concluded that the collision was caused due to not maintaining a proper radar watch. Though both vessels were observing each other on the radar, they had accepted a low radar CPA of 1 mile despite the poor visibility and without taking into consideration errors of radar, especially in range and bearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LIBERIAN CASUALTY REPORT: DECISION OF THE COMMISSIONER OF MARITIME AFFAIRS, R.L.

==Aftermath==
Both vessels were towed into [[Algoa Bay]] for repairs; the ''Venpet'' on 24 December and the ''Venoil'' on 1 January 1978.&lt;ref name="CTX"/&gt; The latter had drifted {{convert|250|mi|km}} southwest of the coast in the [[Agulhas Current]].&lt;ref name="CTX"/&gt; The ''Venoil'''s remaining crude oil was transferred to the tanker ''Litiopa'' before she eventually sailed to Nova Scotia.&lt;ref name="Shippspotting"/&gt; The damaged ships were sailed onto shipyards at [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] and [[Nagasaki]] for extensive repairs.&lt;ref name="Venoil History"/&gt;

==Later life==
The ''Venoil'' underwent two name changes, becoming ''Resolute'' in 1981 and ''Opportunity'' in 1983. She was sailed to [[Ulsan]], [[South Korea]] for scrapping in October 1984.&lt;ref name="Venoil History"/&gt; Her sister ''Venpet'' was changed to ''Alexander The Great'' in 1980. In June 1984, she was hit by an [[Iraq]]i [[Exocet]] [[missile]] whilst moored at the Kharg Island oil terminal. The large scale of damage led to her scrapping, which occurred in [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taiwan]] in the October of that year.&lt;ref name="Venpet History"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9933">[[File:Venticool international platform for entilative cooling.jpg|thumb|right|venticool logo]]

'''venticool''' is an international platform formed in 2012 focusing on [[ventilative cooling]] issues, with the overall goal to "mobilize the ventilative cooling potential in terms of energy conservation, health, and comfort".&lt;ref name = NL1&gt;BUILD UP energy solutions for better buildings: "[http://www.buildup.eu/publications/32676 venticool Newsletter 1]", October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Solar Shading Organization (ES-SO), "[http://www.es-so.com/new/archived/241-venticool-the-international-platform-for-ventilative-cooling venticool the international platform for ventilative cooling]", Retrieved October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = brochure&gt;BUILD UP energy solutions for better buildings, "[http://www.buildup.eu/publications/42312 venticool: the international platform for ventilative cooling]", September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this platform ventilative cooling refers to the use of ventilation strategies to cool indoor spaces.&lt;ref name =venticool&gt;venticool, the international platform for ventilative cooling,  "[http://venticool.eu/faqs/what-is-ventilative-cooling/ What is ventilative cooling?]", Retrieved October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The most common technique is the use of increased ventilation airflow rates but other technologies may be considered as well.&lt;ref name= venticool/&gt;

The creation of the platform was triggered by increasing concerns for overheating risks and thermal comfort in [[Low-energy house|low-energy buildings]], while ventilative cooling strategies remain poorly considered in building regulations and scarcely well-implemented in practice.&lt;ref&gt;European Solar Shading Organization (ES-SO), "[http://www.es-so.com/images/venticool-position-paper___DEF.pdf Position paper for ventilative cooling]", Retrieved October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns are reinforced in particular by the 2020 objectives of the [[European Union]] &lt;ref&gt;European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy: "[http://www.eceee.org/policy-areas/buildings/EPBD_Recast EPBD Recast (Directive 2010/31/EU)- EPBD RECAST APPROVED 19 MAY 2010]", 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Energy Performance of Buildings Directive]] (EPBD).

The platform’s main activities focus on communication, networking and awareness raising. They include the organization of events: conferences, workshops and webinars, as well as the production of publications: papers, reports, guidebooks etc.&lt;ref&gt;European Solar Shading Organization (ES-SO), "[http://www.es-so.com/images/downloads/news/venticool_flyer.pdf venticool brochure]", Retrieved October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== venticool &amp; IEA EBC Annex 62 ==
venticool is the key partner in the communication and dissemination activities of the Annex 62 ‘[[ventilative cooling]]’ research project of the ‘Energy in Buildings and Communities Programme (EBC)’ of the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA), an international collaborative project on ventilative cooling with a four-year working phase (2014–2018).&lt;ref name =Annex&gt;International Energy Agency’s Energy in Buildings and Communities Programme, "[http://www.iea-ebc.org/projects/ongoing-projects/ebc-annex-62/ EBC Annex 62 Ventilative Cooling]", Retrieved October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The main aim of Annex 62 is to make ventilative cooling an attractive and energy efficient cooling solution to avoid overheating in both new and renovated buildings.&lt;ref name =Annex/&gt;

venticool also cooperates with the IEA-EBC’s Annex 5: “[[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre|Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC)]]”, which aims to provide reliable reference information on research and development in the fields of air infiltration and ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency’s Energy in Buildings and Communities Programme,"[http://iea-ebc.org/Data/publications/EBC_Annual_Report_2015.pdf EBC Annual Report 2015]” , February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

An alleged member of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), '''Wahid Khalil Baroud''' (وحيد خليل بارود) was arrested in [[Mississauga, Ontario]] in 1994 after it was claimed that he served as a bodyguard to [[Yasser Arafat]].&lt;ref name="week"&gt;Kezwer, Gil, Jewish Telegraphic Agency, [http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/1208/deportation-slated-for-former-arafat-guard/ Deportation slated for former Arafat guard], June 23, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration to Canada==
In 1991, Baroud took his wife and three children to Greece, before flying into [[Pearson International Airport]] with forged Egyptian passports, and applying for Canadian residency. The family, which would grow with the births in Canada of two more children, claimed to be Israeli, but Baroud acknowledged his time in [[Fatah]], noting that he had never been involved in any terrorism.&lt;ref name="week"/&gt; He claimed to be defecting because he refused to follow an order to travel to Saudi Arabia's border with Iraqi-controlled Kuwait, where some allege he had been ordered to be killed by the PLO authorities.&lt;ref name="jane"/&gt; He stated that, as a Palestinian, he refused to be a party to another occupying power like [[Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref name="ilikeike"&gt;Aiken, Sharryn. "[http://pi.library.yorku.ca/ojs/index.php/refuge/article/view/21221/19892 Manufacturing Terrorists: Refugees, National Security and Canadian Law]", Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Allan. [[Toronto Star]], "Caught in a legal swamp Ex-PLO member spends year in jail seeking `justice'", June 4, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

He was held in detention for 41 days before it was determined he was not a threat, and he was subsequently released.&lt;ref name="jane"&gt;Hughes, Jane. "Detention of Asylum-seekers in Europe", p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
{{Rquote|right|I am mindful of the fact the terms "terrorism" and "terrorist" are not defined in the Act. Counsel for the Ministers affirm in her written memorandum that "Like beauty, the image of a terrorist is, to some extent, in the eye of the beholder". While I accept this statement in general terms, it cannot prevent this court from examining whether, in the circumstances of this case, there are reasonable grounds...|Judge [[Pierre Denault]]&lt;ref&gt;Baroud (Re)  (1995), 98 F.T.R. 99 (F.C.T.D.), Denault J., at paragraphs 28-30&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Three years later, after he ostensibly missed two immigration hearings which he claims to have never received notice of,&lt;ref name="jane"/&gt; a warrant was issued and he was declared a threat to national security under the auspice that he had served in [[Force 17]] as a bodyguard to Arafat, and was stationed in Syria, Lebanon, Libya and Greece and engaged in terrorism. He was arrested on a [[security certificate]] signed by Immigration Minister [[Sergio Marchi (politician)|Sergio Marchi]] and Solicitor General [[Herb Gray]] on June 6, 1994,&lt;ref name="limbotime"&gt;Thompson, Allan. [[Toronto Star]], "`Deported' Arab stuck in jail limbo", June 14, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Federal Court of Canada]]  judge [[Pierre Denault]] ruled that the government was wrong in suggesting it had evidence Baroud was involved in terrorism.&lt;ref name="week"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Allan. [[Toronto Star]], "Jailed Palestinian set to leave Canada", July 5, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Baroud argued that section 40.1 of the [[Immigration Act, 1976|Immigration Act]] was unconstitutional and breached the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;Baroud (Re) (1995), 98 F.T.R. 99 (F.C.T.D.), at paragraph 23. Note 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the courts nevertheless upheld his deportation, he sought leave to appeal to the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] claiming that the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS) had tried to convince him to become an [[informant]] and turned against him when he refused, but was denied on June 15.&lt;ref&gt;Baroud v. MCI, 1995. 22 O.R. (3rd), Part 4, 255. Ontario, Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

"Depressed and discouraged" at his long time spent in the [[Don Jail]], Baroud agreed to voluntarily drop his appeals and allow himself to be removed from Canada and was subsequently moved to [[Toronto West Detention Centre]].&lt;ref name="jane"/&gt;

==Unsuccessful deportation==
His wife and three eldest children were granted [[refugee status]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;JWeekly, [http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/1910/world-report/ World Report], November 3, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Since he was a [[statelessness|stateless]] Palestinian, there was no country to which he could be safely deported, and his wife ended up acquiring an [[visa (document)|entry visa]] for him to Algeria, and he was put on a plane towards Algeria through Switzerland on July 5, but returned to Canada a week later after Algerian authorities refused to let him enter.&lt;ref name="rec"&gt;[[Kitchener Record]], "Former PLO member shares time with family before deportation", July 6, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ilikeike"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Allan. [[Toronto Star]], "Palestinian back in Canada; Algeria refuses deported man entry", July 12, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mallan, Caroline. [[Toronto Star]], "Deported man finally leaves; Palestinian flies to Algeria after 13 months in jail", July 6, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that his Canadian escorts had taken him to [[Casablanca]] hoping to leave him in Morocco; but while they were themselves "mistakenly left behind" in the North African country, Baroud had simply booked himself a plane back to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Allan. [[Toronto Star]], "Add Casablanca saga to Palestinian's odyssey", July 13, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1995, his wife secured a 9-month visa for him to the Sudan, and Canada put him on a plane towards the country - however, Sudan refused to accept him when they learned of the case.&lt;ref name="rec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ilikeike"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Allan. [[Toronto Star]], "Palestinian hustled to plane, deported", December 22, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

He was forced to live in airports for eight months, shuttling between countries.&lt;ref name="barb"&gt;[[Barbara Jackman|Jackman, Barbara]], [http://www.parl.gc.ca/38/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/com-e/anti-e/12evb-e.htm?Language=E&amp;Parl=38&amp;Ses=1&amp;comm_id=597 Proceedings of the Special Senate Committee on the Anti-terrorism Act], May 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources suggest he ended up in [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Colleen.

He finally settled in Belgium and he is welcomed as a Belgian citizen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gXvJmTGia88-5w2wQrPJkbZ96FHQ Palestinian man Canada deported is welcomed as Belgian citizen]&lt;/ref&gt;
