'''Academy of Sciences of Afghanistan''' ('''ASA''') is the official government agency of [[Afghanistan]] that regulates the [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari Persian]]{{Fact|date=April 2009}}  languages spoken in Afghanistan. It also works with [[Tajikistan]] and [[Iran]]'s official government agencies to regulate literature. 

The Academy was founded in 1978 by Dr. Gul Mohammed Noorzai, a historian, writer, and linguist as a result of the merging of older academic associations.&lt;ref name=IAP&gt;{{cite web|title=Academy of Sciences of Afghanistan (ASA)|url=http://www.interacademies.net/Academies/ByRegion/MiddleEastCentralAfrica/Afghanistan.aspx|publisher=Interacademics|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy has more than 300 research fellows,   divided into three main groups: [[social science]], [[natural sciences]], and [[Islamic studies]]. 

During years of [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|civil war]]  many research institutes in Afghanistan have been destroyed. The ASA building as well lacks adequate infrastructure, laboratories, equipment and libraries&lt;ref name=Scidevnet&gt;{{cite web|title=Afghan academy appeals for help in reviving science|url=http://www.scidev.net/global/publishing/news/afghan-academy-appeals-for-help-in-reviving-science-1.html|work=SciDevNet|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7391">[[File:GB Christmas Aerogram.jpg|thumb|GB Christmas Aerogram (one of two issued in 1967)]]
An '''aerogram''', '''aérogramme''', '''air letter''' or '''airletter''' is a thin lightweight piece of foldable and gummed paper for writing a letter for transit via [[airmail]], in which the letter and [[envelope]] are one and the same. Most [[postal administration]]s forbid enclosures in these light letters, which are usually sent abroad at a preferential rate.  Printed warnings existed to say that an enclosure would cause the mail to go at the higher letter rate.

The use of the term ''aerogramme'' was officially endorsed at the 1952 [[Universal Postal Union]] [[Postal Union Congress]] in Brussels.&lt;ref name=gough&gt;"The Evolution of the Postal Service in the Era of the UPU" by Jamie Gough in ''[[The London Philatelist]]'', Vol.114, No. 1331, December 2005, pp.362-363.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter, the term ''air  letter'' quickly faded from use.

Most aerograms have an [[imprinted stamp]] indicating the prepayment of postage.  As such, this meets the definition of being [[postal stationery]]. However, some countries such as [[New Zealand]], [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], sell unstamped aerograms. Unstamped aerograms are referred to as ''[[formular]]'' aerograms and can be issued by either postal authorities or by private companies. Senders are required to write their name and address on the reverse.

==History==
[[File:Iraq 1933.jpg|thumb|The first issued aerogramme – Iraq 1933]]

The aerogram was largely popularized by its use during the Second World War (1939–45). Lieutenant Colonel R. E. Evans, [[Royal Engineers]], Assistant Director Army Postal Service Middle East Force (MEF), proposed that a lightweight self-sealing letter card that weighed only 1/10 oz be adopted by the [[British Army]] for air mail purposes. He recommended its use to [[Sir Anthony Eden]], the Secretary of State for War during his visit to the Middle East, in late 1940. By January the following year, General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell]], the Commander-in-Chief, MEF was told by Eden that ''"Your Assistant Director Army Postal Services may forthwith introduce an Air Mail Letter Card Service for the Middle East. Use British stamps from all countries, including Egypt."''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Defence Postal &amp; Courier Services, London|year=1987|author=Edward Wells|title='Mailshot – A history of the Forces Postal Services'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans first saw the air letter form in Iraq, whilst touring the Commands after his arrival in the Middle East theatre.  It had been introduced into the Iraqi postal service in 1933 by the then Inspector General of Posts and Telegraphs, Major DW Grumbley CBE DSO Royal Engineers. The original form, on thin paper was 124mm x 99mm in size, greyish in colour, with bluelined framing and with the designation legend on the front.  It had a beautifully impressed effigy of [[Faisal I of Iraq]] and was printed by Bradbury Wilkinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Journal of Institute of Royal Engineers, Chatham|year=1981|author=R Hudson|title='Royal Engineers Air Postal Engineering' – REJ Vol 95 No 2 p.117-120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March 1941, the [[air mail]] service between the Middle East and the UK was started, using a combination of [[British Overseas Airways]] [[flying boat]]s and military transport. The private nature of the air letter ensured its popularity among its users and that popularity, with its lightness, brought about its continued use as today's civilian air letter (aerograms) and the British military "bluey". (see [[British Forces Post Office]] for further information).

On April 29, 1947, the US entered the scene with a 10 cent ''Air Letter'' Sheet.  The same imprinted stamp with the propeller plane was used until updated with a jet airliner image in 1958.  The US issued a total of 25 aerograms through 1999.&lt;ref name=Undersander&gt;Undersander, Dan, Ed.; ''Catalog of the 20th and 21st Century Stamped Envelopes and Wrappers of the United States'', Third Edition, UPSS, 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-9800112-8-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The production of United States aerograms has ceased.&lt;ref&gt;Airpost Journal: vol 78, no.2, February 2007 pub: [[American Air Mail Society]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linn's Stamp News]] in late 2006 reported that the [[United States Postal Service]] had announced as the supply of aerograms on hand at post offices were exhausted the stock would not be replenished. It quotes David Failor, Postal Service executive director of stamp services as explaining, "Demand for these has been next to nothing for the past five years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stampcollectingroundup.blogspot.com/2006/10/us-aerograms-to-disappear.html|title=The Stamp Collecting Round-Up: US aerograms to disappear|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the decline in postal communication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/australia-post-posts-222m-loss-letter-posting-in-terminal-decline-20150925-gjup78.html|title=Australia Post delivers $222 million loss as letter posting in 'terminal decline'|first=Jenny|last=Wiggins|date=25 September 2015|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerograms have been withdrawn from various postal services. Royal Mail in the United Kingdom disbanded the aerogram in April, 2012.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Aerograms (aerogramme) are still available from Australia's Australia Post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shop.auspost.com.au/product/aerogramme-jan-billycan-design-6825402|title=Aerogramme - Jan Billycan design|website=Australia Post Shop|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Not in refs|date=August 2018}}

Historically, as the aerogram was the least expensive form of international postal communication, users often went to extreme lengths to make best use of the space available including writing in different colours, [[crossed letter|in different directions]], and printing on the sheets minimising font size and margins.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

'''Aino Krohn Kallas''' (2 August 1878 &amp;ndash; 9 November 1956) was a [[Finland|Finnish]]-[[Estonia]]n author.  Her [[novella]]s are considered to be prominent pieces of Finnish literature.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://elm.estinst.ee/issue/12/marriage-aino-and-oskar-kallas/ The marriage of Aino and Oskar Kallas], Sirje Oleske, Estonian Literary Magazine, no 12, spring 2001, Retrieved 1 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Kallas is also known for her love affair with the legendary poet [[Eino Leino]]. 

==Life==
[[File:Back row from left Ilmari, Kaarle, Helmi with spouse E.N. Setälä; in front Aune, Helena née Cleve, Aino 1890s maybe.jpg|thumb|left|Back row from left {{ill|Ilmari Krohn|fi}}, [[Kaarle Krohn|Kaarle]], [[Helmi Krohn|Helmi]] with [[Eemil Nestor Setälä|E.N. Setälä]]; in front [[Aune Krohn]], Helena née Cleve and Aino]]
Kallas was the daughter of [[Julius Krohn]], a nationally known [[Finnish people|Finnish]] scientist and [[fennoman]], and the sister of the folklorist [[Kaarle Krohn]]&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; and the writer [[Helmi Krohn]]. Her father was also one of the first people to publish poetry written in the [[Finnish language]]. In 1900, Kallas married [[Oskar Kallas]], an [[Estonia]]n scholar, doctor of [[folklore]] and later [[diplomat]]. The couple lived in [[Saint Petersburg]] and had five children. In 1904, they moved to [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]]. Kallas became interested in the history and culture of her new homeland and she joined [[Noor-Eesti]], a sociocultural society which campaigned for the independence of Estonia.  Although she continued writing in Finnish, she often wrote about Estonian subjects.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; She lived in [[London]] from 1922 to 1934, while her husband was Estonia's ambassador to the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Sirje Olesk.  The marriage of Aino and Oskar Kallas a Finnish bridge in reality, Estonian Literary Magazine, volume 12, 2001, {{ISSN|1406-0345}} {{cite web |url=http://www.einst.ee/literary/spring2001/12_01.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228150844/http://www.einst.ee/literary/spring2001/12_01.htm |archivedate=2005-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
She published her diaries for the period 1897-1931 in the 1950s.
[[File:Portrait of Aino Kallas.jpg|left|thumb|''Portrait of Aino Kallas'' by [[Konrad Mägi]], 1918, Indian ink on paper.]]
A recurring theme in Kallas's novellas is what she termed "the slaying Eros", a love that often leads to death, especially prominent in her trilogy of ''Barbara von Tisenhusen'' (1923), ''Reigin Pappi'' (The Pastor of Reigi, 1926), and ''Sudenmorsian'' (The Wolf's Bride, 1928).&lt;ref name="cbdc"&gt;Chantal Bourgault Du Coudray, ''The Curse of the Werewolf : Fantasy, Horror and the Beast Within''. London: I.B. Tauris, 2006. {{ISBN|9781429462655}} (p. 112, 169)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Pastor of Reigi'' and ''Barbara von Tisenhusen'' were soon translated into English and published in 1927 as ''Eros the Slayer''. The language of her most famous story, ''Sudenmorsian'', a [[werewolf]] story set in 17th century [[Hiiumaa]], is rich with archaic, Romantic, colorful prose, something of a Kallas trademark.&lt;ref name="cbdc" /&gt; These three stories have more recently been published in one English-language volume as ''Three Novels'' (1975). A collection of her short stories was published in English under the title ''The White Ship'', with a foreword by [[John Galsworthy]] in 1924.

[[File:Pulmonary contusion CT arrow.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Pulmonary contusion]] due to trauma is an example of a condition that can be asymptomatic with half of people showing no signs at the initial presentation since such symptoms can take time to develop. The [[CT scan]] shows a pulmonary contusion (red arrow) accompanied by a [[rib fracture]] (purple arrow).]]
In [[medicine]], a [[disease]] is considered '''asymptomatic''' if a patient is a carrier for a disease or [[Infectious disease|infection]] but experiences no [[symptom]]s. A condition might be asymptomatic if it fails to show  the noticeable symptoms with which it is usually associated. Asymptomatic infections are also called [[subclinical infection]]s.  Other diseases (such as [[mental illness]]es) might be considered '''subclinical''' if they present some but not all of the symptoms required for a clinical diagnosis.  The term '''clinically silent''' is also used.

Knowing that a condition is asymptomatic is important because:
* It may develop symptoms later and so require [[watch and wait]] or early treatment.
* It may resolve itself or become [[benign]].
* It is required that a person undergoes treatment so it does not cause later medical problems such as [[high blood pressure]] and [[hyperlipidaemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.7861/clinmedicine.1-3-230 | last1 = Tattersall | first1 = R | title = Diseases the doctor (or autoanalyser) says you have got | journal = [[Clinical Medicine]] |location= London | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 230–3 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11446622}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Be alert to possible problems: asymptomatic [[hypothyroidism]] makes a person vulnerable to [[Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome]] or [[beri-beri]] following [[intravenous]] glucose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

* The affected person may be infectious and [[Subclinical infection|unknowingly spread]] the infection to others.

An example of an asymptomatic disease is [[Cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) which is a member of the herpes virus.  "It is estimated that 1% of all newborns are infected with CMV, but the majority of infections are asymptomatic." (Knox, 1983; Kumar et al. 1984)&lt;ref&gt;Vinson, B. (2012).  Language Disorders Across the Lifespan. p. 94.  Clifton Park, NY:  Delmar&lt;/ref&gt; In some diseases, the proportion of asymptomatic cases can be important. For example, in [[multiple sclerosis]] it is estimated that around 25% of the cases are asymptomatic, being these cases detected postmortem or just by coincidence (as [[incidental findings]]) while treating other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Engell T | date = May 1989 | title = A clinical patho-anatomical study of clinically silent multiple sclerosis | url = | journal = Acta Neurol Scand | volume = 79 | issue = 5| pages = 428–30 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0404.1989.tb03811.x | pmid=2741673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions==

Asymptomatic conditions may not be discovered until the patient undergoes medical tests ([[X-ray]]s or other investigations). Some people may remain asymptomatic for a remarkably long period of time; such as people with some forms of [[cancer]]. If a patient is asymptomatic, precautionary steps must be taken.

A patient's individual genetic makeup may delay or prevent the onset of symptoms.

Some diseases are defined only clinically, like [[AIDS]] being opposed to [[HIV]] infection. Therefore, it makes no sense to speak about "asymptomatic AIDS". This concept of '''clinically defined diseases''' is related in some way to the concept of [[syndrome]].

==List==
These are conditions for which there is a sufficient number of documented individuals that are asymptomatic that it is clinically noted. For a complete list of asymptomatic infections see [[Subclinical infection#List of subclinical infections|subclinical infection]].

A '''berth''' is a designated location in a port or harbour used for [[mooring (watercraft)|mooring]] vessels when they are not at sea. Berths provide a vertical front which allows safe and secure mooring that can then facilitate the unloading or loading of cargo or people from vessels.

== Locations in a port ==
[[File:Dock berth.jpg|thumb|Two small [[marina]]-type berths]]

Berth is the term used in [[port]]s and [[harbor]]s for a designated location where a vessel may be moored, usually for the purposes of loading and unloading. Berths are designated by the management of a facility (e.g., port authority, harbor master). Vessels are assigned to berths by these authorities.

Most berths are alongside a [[quay]] or a [[jetty]] (large ports) or a [[floating dock (jetty)|floating dock]] (small harbors and marinas). Berths are either general or specific to the types of vessel that use them. The size of the berths varies from {{convert|5|-|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} for a small boat in a marina to over {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} for the largest tankers.  The rule of thumb is that the length of a berth should be roughly 10% longer than the longest vessel to be moored at the berth.

== Berth Type by Construction ==
The following is a list of berth types based on the method of construction:&lt;ref&gt;http://app.knovel.com/web/view/pdf/show.v/rcid:kpPDHRG004/cid:kt00U1AVB1/viewerType:pdf/root_slug:port-designers-handbook/url_slug:types-bert-general?cid=kt00U1AVB1&amp;&amp;issue_id=kt00U1AX93&amp;b-toc-cid=kpPDHRG004&amp;b-toc-root-slug=port-designers-handbook&amp;b-toc-url-slug=types-bert-general&amp;b-toc-title=Port%20Designer's%20Handbook%20-%20Recommendations%20and%20Guidelines&lt;/ref&gt;
;Solid Structure Berth
: In these berths, a solid vertical structure is created to contain fill material which is brought all the way to the structure. They can be constructed using either a gravity wall structure where the front wall of the structure uses its own weight and friction to contain the fill or with a sheet pile structure where an anchoring plate is used to contain the weight of the fill dirt.  
;Open Structure Berth
: Open berths feature structures supported by piles set slightly off shore from the natural extent of the land or the farthest extent of fill dirt. This style of berth can offer more flexibility in the specificity of construction but also presents more complicated dredging projects afterwards and also limits the amount of weight the berth is able to support and resist.

== Berth Type by Geometry ==
The following is a list of berth types based on the method of geometry:
;Finger Pier
: Used to maximize the berthing space per length of waterfront.&lt;ref&gt;Thoresen, Carl A.  "Port Designer's Handbook: Recommendations and Guidelines." 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Finger piers are often used for small to medium vessels associated with passenger travel. Finger piers can also be used for dangerous cargoes such as military munitions that can not be used with offshore berths because of the weight and equipment requirements. In these instances long finger piers allow for far reach far off shore with access for rail or other cargo moving methods on the pier. 
;Offshore Berth
: Used when cargo handling/storage can be hazardous.  Often offshore berths are created for berthing of oil and gas vessels.  They contain stand alone structures called dolphins which have fenders and bollards located to based on the geometry of the vessels which would call the berth.

== Berth Type by Cargo ==
The following is a list of berth types based on cargo of the ships calling:

;Bulk Berth: Used to handle either dry or liquid [[bulk cargo]]. Vessels are loaded using either excavators, [[conveyor belt]]s, and/or pipelines. Storage facilities for the bulk cargo are often alongside the berth – e.g. [[silo]]s or stockpiles. 
;Container Berth: Used to handle standard [[intermodal container]]s. Vessels are loaded and unloaded by container cranes, designed specifically for the task. These berths will feature large areas of land for container handling near the berth and will also have significant equipment on dock to facilitate rapid movement of containers on and off the vessels. Alongside the quay there is often a large flat area used to store both the imported and exported containers.
;General Berth: Used to handle smaller shipments of general cargo. Vessels using these would usually have their own [[lifting gear]], but some ports will provide mobile cranes to do this. These are common at smaller ports or ports where special project cargo is common.
;Lay Berth (Layberth)
:A berth used for idle (lay-up status) vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exchange.dnv.com/publishing/cn/GL_22.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602210029/http://exchange.dnv.com/publishing/cn/GL_22.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vessels being put on the hook can use these as intermediate points between operational use and mothballing at an off shore mooring. These berths will feature very little land side access or equipment except what is needed to secure the vessel.
;Lay-by Berth: A general berth for use by vessels for short term waiting until a loading or discharging berth is available. These berths can feature very basic amenities for fuel, provisions, and utilities to sustain a crew and vessel until the destination berth is available. 
;Liquid Berth: Used to handle oil and gas related products. Berths are placed offshore to keep safe zone of operation from rest of port operations.  Vessels are loaded via loading arms containing the pipe lines.  Cargo is the pumped back on shore through pipelines, which are usually submerged. Storage facilities for the products are usually some distance away from the berth and connected by these pipelines.
;Marina Berth: Used to allow the owners of leisure craft on and off their boats.  Generally alongside pontoons and accessed by hinged bridges (in tidal locations) to the shore. Marina berths are often built with modular capabilities to adjust the berth size for various shapes and sizes of recreational craft. Specialized equipment for keeping boats out of the water is also a frequent feature. This allows the vessel to be removed from the negative effects of wave action on the hull and helps prevent organic growth on the hull.
;X Berth: Suitable for nuclear-powered warships, and part of an operational Naval base or a building and refitting yard. All X-berths have as an integral part of their safety arrangements a permanent health physics department, a local emergency monitoring organisation and a local safety plan prepared under the auspices of a local liaison committee.&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm198889/cmhansrd/1989-05-05/Writtens-3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6139">Cherokee is a member of the [[Iroquoian language]] family.

In 1824 the first portion of the Bible was translated into the [[Cherokee language]]: [[Gospel of John|John]] 3, translated by a native Cherokee, ᎠᎢ (At-see, also known as John Arch). It was circulated in manuscript, and received with wonderful avidity, being copied hundreds of times.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Biography of Se-Quo-Yah, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; He completed the Gospel of John by 1824&lt;ref&gt;Cherokee Messenger, by Althea Bass&lt;/ref&gt; The complete [[New Testament]] was translated in September 1825 by [[David Brown (translator)|David Brown]], also a native Cherokee; this was also circulated in manuscript form, as a type for the [[Cherokee syllabary]] had not yet been created. Both Archer and Brown translated the full New Testament into Cherokee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ubs-translations.org/fileadmin/publications/tbt/technical/TBT_TP_Jan06_Owens.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cherokee printing|first actual printing]] of a Bible portion in Cherokee appeared in the Missionary Herald of December, 1827, and consisted of the first verse of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], translated by [[Samuel Worcester]]. In 1828, David Brown, together with a man named George Lowrey, translated [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]. This was printed in the [[Cherokee Phoenix]] from April 3, 1828 till July 29, 1829. It is uncertain whether this translation was ever published in book form or not.

Samuel Worcester, and [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]], editor of the Cherokee Phoenix, published a revised translation of Matthew in 1829. This was published by the Cherokee National Press, [[New Echota]]. In the second edition, published in 1832, there is a statement that this translation had been "compared with the translation of George Lowrey and David Brown."&lt;ref&gt;Early Bibles of America, by John Wright, pg. 278&lt;/ref&gt; A third edition was printed by the Park Hill Mission Press in 1840.

Worcester and Boudinot continued with translation, publishing [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] in 1833 and [[Gospel of John|John]] in 1838. Worcester, together with Stephen Foreman, published John 1&amp;ndash;3 in 1840, [[First Epistle to Timothy|1]] and [[Second Epistle to Timothy|2 Timothy]] in 1844, [[Epistle of James|James]] in 1847, [[First Epistle of Peter|1]] and [[Second Epistle of Peter|2 Peter]] in 1848, [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] in 1850, [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] in 1853, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] in 1856, [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] in 1857, and [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] through [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] in 1858. With the assistance of Charles C. Torrey, they published [[Epistle to Philippians|Philippians]] through [[2 Thessalonians]], [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] through [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] and [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]] through [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] in 1859. Besides the first three books translated together with Boudinot, Matthew (1829), Acts (1833), and John (1838), which were published in [[New Echota]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], all the rest of Worcester's texts were published by the Park Hill Mission Press. In the meantime, Evan and John B. Jones had published [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] [[1 Thessalonians|1]] and [[2 Thessalonians]], Titus, Jude, and [[Epistle to Philemon|Philemon]] in 1847, and [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] through [[Epistle to the Colossians|Colossians]], 1 and 2 Peter in 1848 and Romans, [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1]] and [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians|2 Corinthians]], Hebrews and Revelation in 1849. Their work was published by the Cherokee Baptist Mission.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Eric North, Eugene Nida, The Book of a Thousand Tongues, United Bible Societies, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; The full New Testament was published by the American Bible Society in 1860.

With the help of Stephen Foreman, Worcester also translated portions of [[Psalms]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], and [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6fgy9lP97YkC&amp;dq=%22cherokee+new+testament%22 Early Bibles of America: Being a Descriptive Account of Bibles Published in the United States] by John Wright&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Book of Jonah|Jonah]], translated by Amory N. Chamberlain, was published in Tahlequah in 1888. [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] was at an advanced stage of translation, and was perhaps even completed &lt;ref name="Missions1857"&gt;{{cite book|author=American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions|title=The Missionary herald|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o5MUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA241|accessdate=30 October 2012|year=1857|publisher=Published for the Board by Samuel T. Armstrong|page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was never published.

A "corrected version" of old Testament portions, prepared by M.A. Pearson, was published in 1953 by the [[American Bible Society]].

Revisions of John (1948) and the New Testament (1951) were published in Westville, Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 1965 the [[Perkins School of Theology]] published a translation of [[Book of Haggai|Haggai]] by Jack and Anna Kilpatrick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldcat.org/oclc/13025593 The book of Haggai translated into Cherokee [WorldCat.org&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1492">[[Romani languages]] are the languages spoken by the [[Romani people|Roma people]], commonly called [[Romani people|Gypsies]] or Romanes.

The first Gospel to be translated into a Romani language was the Gospel of Luke into the [[Caló language]], spoken in Spain and Portugal. It was translated by [[George Borrow]]. This was printed  by the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] in 1837 and a revision was printed in 1872.



The New Testament has been translated into various forms of Romani in part and in whole. Some versions of it is available online on YouVersion.

In recent years there have been a number of editions of the whole Bible in Romani.  The whole Bible was translated into Kalderash Romani by Mateo Maximoff in France, and into Baltic Romani by Valdemar Kalinnin.

'''Buru''' or '''Buruese''' ({{lang-id|Bahasa Buru}}) is a [[Malayo-Polynesian language]]s of the [[Central Maluku languages|Central Maluku]] branch. In 1991 it was spoken by approximately 45,000 [[Buru people]] who live on the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Buru]] ({{lang-id|Pulau Buru}}).&lt;ref name="Grimes" /&gt; It is also preserved in the Buru communities on [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and some other [[Maluku Islands]], as well as in the Indonesian capital [[Jakarta]] and in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="etnologue" /&gt;

The most detailed study of Buru language was conducted in the 1980s by Australian missionaries and ethnographers Charles E. Grimes and Barbara Dix Grimes.&lt;ref name="BG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bible" /&gt;

==Dialects==
Three dialects of Buru can be distinguished, each of which is used by its corresponding ethnic group on Buru island: Rana (named after the lake in the center of Buru; more than 14,000 speakers), Masarete (more than 9,500 speakers) and Wae Sama (more than 6,500 speakers). Some 3,000–5,000 of Rana people along with their main dialect use the so-called "secret dialect" Ligahan. The dialect of Fogi which once existed in the western area of the island is now extinct.&lt;ref name=D&amp;T /&gt; Lexical differences between the dialects are about 90% between Masarete and Wae Sama, 88% between Masarete and Rana and 80% between Wae Sama and Rana. Aside from native vernaculars, most Buru people, especially in the coastal regions and towns, have at least some command and understanding of the official language of the country, [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. The coastal population also uses the ''Melayu Ambon'', also known as [[Ambonese Malay]]&lt;ref name="etnologue" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Etno" /&gt;

==Naming and taboo==
Buru people use traditional names, along with Muslim or Christian names, the most common being Lesnussa, Latbual, Nurlatu, Lehalima, Wael and Sigmarlatu. The language has several sets of taboo words, which are both behavioral and linguistic. For example, relatives refer to each other by kin names, but not by proper names (i.e., father, but not Lesnussa). However, contrary to many other Austronesian cultures, Buru people do refer to the deceased relatives by name. Other restrictions apply to the objects of nature, harvest, hunting and fishing, for which certain words should be chosen depending on the island area. These taboos have explanations in associated myths of legends. In all cases, the words for taboo items are not omitted, but substituted by alternatives.&lt;ref name=D&amp;T/&gt; All Buru dialects have loanwords. Many of them originated from Dutch and Portuguese during the Dutch colonization and referred to the objects not previously seen on the island. Other types of borrowed words came from Malayan languages as a result of inflow of people from the nearby island.&lt;ref name =D&amp;T/&gt;

==Phonology==
The Buru language has 5 vowels and 17 consonants.&lt;ref name="Grimes" /&gt;  They are illustrated on the tables below:
{| class="wikitable"

==Writing system==
Contrary to other indigenous languages of Buru and the nearby island of Ambelau ([[Lisela language|Lisela]], [[Kayeli language|Kayeli]] and [[Ambelau language|Ambelau]]), Buru has a functional writing system based on the Latin alphabet. Buru [[Christians]] worship with a Bible written in their native language, the first translations of which were made back in 1904 by Dutch missionaries.&lt;ref name="etnologue" /&gt;

==Grammar==
The Buru language can be classified as an [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]] language, [[Preposition and postposition|prepositional]], with modifiers following the [[head (linguistics)|head]] noun in a [[noun phrase]], and the [[Genitive case|genitive]] occurring before the noun.

===Pronouns and Person Markers===
Free pronouns may be used equally for the subject and object of intransitive verbs (marking either actor or undergoer).&lt;ref name="Grimes" /&gt;

===Possession===
Depending on its distribution a possessive word can behave verbally or nominally, or as the head of a predicative [[possessive]] construction or as the [[grammatical modifier|modifier]] of the possessive [[noun phrase|NP]]. 
The possessive word is the only word in the Buru language obligatorily [[inflection|inflected]] for person and number and behaves much like a [[verb]] in its affixing possibilities. All examples in this section have been taken from Grimes, 1991 chapter 14.&lt;ref name="Grimes" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The basic structure of the [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] is SVO.
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
|(1) ||''Yako''||''nango''||''huma''||''saa.''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;1SG&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;1SGPOSS&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;house&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;one&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| ||colspan=5| "I have/own a house." (p.&amp;nbsp;279) 
|}
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Functional and distributional behaviour of the possessive construction:'''
&lt;br /&gt;
[[applicative voice|Applicative]] /-k/ is used to indicate a definite pronominal object (an object that functions as a pronoun). 
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
|(2) ||''Todo''||''naa,''||''ya''||''nangu-k.''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;machete&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;PROX&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;1SG&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;1SGPOSS-k&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| ||colspan=5| "This machete, it is mine." (p.&amp;nbsp;280)
|}
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
|(3) ||''San''||''nake-k?''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;who&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;3SGPOSS-k&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| ||colspan=5| "Whose is it?." (p.&amp;nbsp;280)
|}
&lt;br /&gt;
The possessive word can also accept [[valency (linguistics)|valence]] changing verbal prefixes however this is restricted to the third singular form 'nake'.
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|

'''Calltrunk''' is a self-service call management and call-recording solution built on the [[OP3Nvoice]] platform for consumers and corporates. Calltrunk has the ability to record and store conversations made via any phone, fixed line, mobile or VOIP (Voice over Internet) phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wall |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21125291 |title=BBC News - Should we be recording our phone calls? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Calltrunk" is headquartered in London, England, with offices in Dallas, Texas, USA and Montreal, Canada. The team consists of Paul Murphy (Founder &amp; CEO), Angela Clarke (Founder &amp; VP Product).&lt;ref name="techcrunch1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/28/be-careful-what-you-say-calltrunk-launches-skype-recording-integration/ |title=Be careful what you say – CallTrunk launches Skype recording integration |publisher=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was started because the Calltrunk founders personally needed a cloud-based call recording service. With backgrounds in telephony and software, they built a company, Calltrunk, to fill the need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calltrunk.com/ww/en/the-company/about-us.html |title=Call Recording - Somewhere else - The company - About us |publisher=Calltrunk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Newton, Calltrunk's marketing director, says: "Companies record us, so why shouldn't we record them? If there's a dispute, they hold all the cards. We wanted to put power back into the hands of the consumer".&lt;ref name="Wall"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wall |first=Matthew |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21125291 |title=BBC News - Should we be recording our phone calls? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calltrunk has global investment banks among its clients and recently secured nearly £2m in investment funding to outsource the ARGOsearch programme to large corporates.&lt;ref name="Wall"/&gt;

== ARGOSearch ==

Calltrunk launched a conversation search engine application called [[ARGOsearch]]. The software, available for computers and mobile devices, enables users to record phone calls and search them for verbal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://calltrunk.com |title=Calltrunk |publisher=Calltrunk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124092219/https://www.calltrunk.com/ |archivedate=2012-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subscribers store spoken data from mobiles, land lines, [[Skype]] or a dictaphone, and upload them into an online storage bank. They can then search the recorded conversations for dates, times, words or phrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tech/news/a377209/argosearch-conversation-search-engine-launches.html#ixzz2IpevFbQN |title=ARGOsearch conversation search engine launches - Tech News |publisher=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology can struggle to cope with background noise and some regional accents, resulting in accuracy rates too low to make services acceptable to a mass audience. Calltrunk's word indexation accuracy is around 80%.&lt;ref name="Wall"/&gt;

[[ARGOsearch]] enables individuals and small companies to capture, store and search conversations in the way that large companies already can.&lt;ref name="Digital Spy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tech/news/a377209/argosearch-conversation-search-engine-launches.html#ixzz2IpfE9GKJ |title=ARGOsearch conversation search engine launches - Tech News |publisher=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the regular Calltrunk service charges a monthly fee, ArgoSearch is currently free, though a Calltrunk spokesman said the company would eventually charge for it. It works in Web browsers and on the iPhone, and Android phones.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boehret |first=Katherine |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304432704577349881132834906 |title=Keeping Close Track of Chats, Word for Word - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARGOsearch is available in beta in the US, UK and Australia. Users can sign up via the Calltrunk website or through its mobile apps.&lt;ref name="Digital Spy"/&gt;

== Usability and File Management ==

Calltrunk’s products allows you to share and/or make your recordings with [[Evernote]], [[Box (service)|Box]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Sugar CRM]], download or order transcriptions.

All CallTrunk recordings can be accessed online via a browser or via Call Trunk’s [[iPhone]] app. The recordings can also be shared on social networks or sent to Evernote, box or SugarCRM.&lt;ref name="techcrunch1"/&gt;

== Legalities ==
Calltrunk maintains that when recording conversations for private purposes - as long as that recording is not shared with a third party - only one person needs to be aware of, and consent to, the recording.&lt;ref name="Wall"/&gt;

Anthony Lee, data protection and privacy expert at law firm Bircham Dyson Bell, agrees, but only up to a point.&lt;ref name="Wall"/&gt; "This does not apply if you want to use a third party, such as a cloud service-provider, to store recordings, particularly if sensitive personal data is involved, or if the recording is to be stored on servers which are located outside of the European Economic Area," he says. "The informed consent and, sometimes, the explicit consent of the individual or individuals concerned, will typically be required. It will be interesting to see the practice which emerges here."

Calltrunk disagrees and believes the law is analogous to that covering email, which, technically speaking, requires the consent of the sender before you can forward it. Practically no-one does this.&lt;ref name="Wall"/&gt;

About recording people secretly, the system provides automatic beeping to signal recording is in progress. There is also an automatic announcement that a user can switch off if they prefer to tell the counter party themselves. These are customisable which reflects that requirements change from country to country and state to state.&lt;ref name="techcrunch1"/&gt;

Calltrunk co-founder Angela Clarke said federal law only requires single-party consent for recorded calls, though some states require all-party consent. Representatives from Calltrunk and Uppidy said they leave it up to users to notify people if they are being recorded.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;[[Telephone recording laws]]&lt;/ref&gt; The law differs considerably from country to country. In the UK, Canada, and some states in the US, this so-called 'one party consent' is adequate (but businesses in the UK must tell people that calls are being recorded).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newbusiness.co.uk/articles/legal-advice/the-legal-ramifications-recording-conversations |title=The legal ramifications of recording conversations - Legal Advice, business advice or business startups and starting a business, with free business e-newsletter |publisher=Newbusiness.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 15 states of the US, however, all parties involved need to have consented. This is also the case in Australia.

== Acquisition ==
Calltrunk was acquired by Bettervoice in May 2015. BetterVoice integrates with your address book just as Calltrunk did. Their outbound calling system uses your phone's outbound line, which is a more natural experience than Calltrunk's dial-back according to the letter sent to all CallTrunk users prior to the acquisition. On 8th May 2015 Calltrunk was completely shut down.

'''Carlos Semprún Maura''' (23 November 1926 in [[Madrid]]&amp;ndash;23 March 2009 in [[Paris]]) was a Spanish writer, playwright and journalist, mainly working in the French language.

==Biography==
The son of the Spanish politician, writer and diplomat José María Semprún Gurrea (1893-1966) and Susana Maura Gamazo, the youngest daughter of [[Antonio Maura]] who served several times as prime minister of Spain, he was the brother of the writer [[Jorge Semprún]], father of Diego Semprún and uncle of the essayist [[Jaime Semprún]] and the tennis player [[Pablo Semprún]].

From 1936 he remained outside of his native Spain (his father José María Semprún Gurrea was a diplomat to the Republican government during the [[Spanish Civil War]]) and later continued in exile during the [[Spanish State]].  He was a militant member of the Communist Party of Spain during its first years, but left the Party before the expulsion of his brother Jorge.  He continued his anti-Francoist militancy in other left-wing groups.  In the magazine that published 'Acción Comunista' he signed articles with the [[pseudonym]] Lorenzo Torres.  In the 2000s his ideological "evolution" placed him in very critical positions towards the left in general.  He called himself liberal, anti-communist and said that democracy was only possible in capitalism.&lt;ref name=Brothers&gt;[https://www.revistadelibros.com/articulos/memorias-de-carlos-y-jorge-semprun An Appreciation of the Semprún Brothers - Revista de Libros- 8 January 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a film critic for ''[[Diario 16]]'' and regularly collaborated in ''[[Libertad Digital]]'' and ''La Ilustración Liberal'' with his 'Cosmopolitan Chronicles' and his 'Letter of Paris', being one of its first columnists. He wrote over 50 plays: in 1971 his play ''The Sleeping Man'' was performed at the Théâtre du Lucernaire in Paris starring [[Pascale de Boysson]] and was directed by [[Laurent Terzieff]].&lt;ref name=Brothers/&gt;

He died in Paris on 23 March 2009 aged 82.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.libertaddigital.com/sociedad/fallece-en-paris-carlos-semprun-maura-1276354299/ Fallece en París Carlos Semprún Maura - ''[[Libertad Digital]]'' - 23 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32344">A '''carriage dispute''' is a disagreement over the right to "carry", that is, retransmit, a [[broadcasting|broadcaster's]] signal. Carriage disputes first occurred between broadcasters and [[cable television|cable]] companies and now include [[direct broadcast satellite]] and other [[multichannel video programming distributors]].

These disputes often involve financial compensation – what the distributor pays the [[television station]] or [[television network|network]] for the right to carry the signal – as well as what channels the distributor is permitted or required to retransmit and how the distributor offers those channels to its subscribers.&lt;ref name="McMurria"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://faculty.fordham.edu/andersen/hypercommercialism.pdf|title=Battleground: The Media Volume 1|last=McMurria|first=John|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2008|isbn=0313341672|editor1-last=Andersen|editor1-first=Robin|location=Westport, CT|pages=69–76|chapter=Cable Carriage Disputes|editor2-last=Grey|editor2-first=Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most carriage disputes are resolved without controversy or notice,&lt;ref name="NYT DirecTVvsViacom"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stelter|first=Brian|title=DirecTV-Viacom Dispute May Affect Access for 20 Million Customers|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/directv-viacom-dispute-may-affect-access-for-20-million-customers/|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; others have involved programming [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackouts]], both threatened and real, as well as strident public relations campaigns. Carriage disputes have occurred both in the United States and internationally.

==History==
The history of carriage disputes can be seen as having two distinct circumstances: the first involving [[terrestrial television|over-the-air broadcasters]], whose signals can be received with an antenna; the second involving broadcasters transmitting via cable, satellite or other means—but not over the air. In the United States, the first led to a quagmire of legal disputes involving the [[Federal Communications Commission]] and the courts, shifting regulations, and questions over copyright law – all revolving around the basic question of whether a carrier has an inherent right to retransmit an over-the-air signal. Broadcasters accused carriers of being "leeches", making money off of programming content that they contributed nothing to produce.&lt;ref name=Robichaux&gt;{{cite book|last=Robichaux|first=Mark|title=Cable Cowboy: John Malone and the Rise of the Modern Cable Business|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-23639-9|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carriers countered that their role was largely passive, because they were merely redistributing freely available signals more widely.&lt;ref name=Seiden&gt;{{cite book|last=Seiden|first=Martin H.|title=Cable Television U.S.A.: an Analysis of Government Policy|year=1972|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=New York, London|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, carriage disputes involving broadcasters who do not use the public airwaves, while representing many high-profile encounters, have raised fewer legal and policy questions, playing out largely at the negotiation table and in the [[court of public opinion]].

The legal precedent for carriage disputes dates back to 1934 legislation, which required a broadcaster to get permission before using programming from another broadcaster. The law was later applied to cable companies, as well.&lt;ref name="FCC Guide"/&gt; In the 1950s, cable companies operating in the [[western United States]] began retransmitting broadcast signals for the benefit of customers situated too far from the station's transmitter to receive programs with an antenna. Stations objected that they were not being compensated for this retransmission or that they were having to compete with more distant stations that duplicated their content. From February 15, 1966 to December 18, 1968, the [[United States]] Federal Communications Commission barred cable companies from importing non-local broadcast signals into the top 100 television markets – while allowing cable companies to petition for exceptions. After an interim period, the FCC partially lifted these restrictions in 1972, eliminating them entirely by the end of the decade.&lt;ref name=McMurria /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seiden|first=Martin H.|title=Cable Television U.S.A.: an Analysis of Government Policy|year=1972|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=New York, London|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue was finally resolved with the 1992 [[Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act]]. Among its provisions, the act mandated that distributors [[must carry]] local stations who make their signal available for free, but must also get [[retransmission consent]] before a signal can be retransmitted. Mandatory retransmission consent gave broadcasters the ability to seek compensation from distributors and established the basis for carriage disputes going forward. At first, the larger broadcasters negotiated not for higher fees, but for inclusion of their newer, lesser known, non-terrestrial channels. [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], for example, obtained distribution for [[FX (TV channel)|FX]]; [[NBC]] for [[CNBC]].&lt;ref name=McMurria /&gt;&lt;ref name="FCC Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cable Carriage of Broadcast Stations|url=http://www.fcc.gov/guides/cable-carriage-broadcast-stations|work=Guides|publisher=Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice complicated carriage disputes by making bundled tiers not just a marketing choice, but a contractual obligation.&lt;ref name="NPR: history of cable bill"&gt;{{cite news|title=Episode 488: The Secret History Of Your Cable Bill|newspaper=National Public Radio: Planet Money|date=September 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carriage disputes have since increased both in intensity and frequency.  According to the American Television Alliance, a television viewer advocacy group, there were eight blackouts of various lengths in 2010, 94 in 2014, 123 in 2015, and 212 in late 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-cbs-dish-blackout-20171121-story.html|title=Millions of Dish customers lose CBS signals, face Thanksgiving without network's football|last=James|first=Meg|date=November 21, 2017|work=latimes.com|access-date=2017-11-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hz4lDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=programming+blackouts+over-the-top+services&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4UqTJaLdaq&amp;sig=df3TJEgPRNG0EoFbCcXmUrOJcaY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSsrT8itDXAhVJqVQKHeoQCIsQ6AEIQjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=programming%20blackouts%20over-the-top%20services&amp;f=false|title=Communication Technology Update and Fundamentals: 15th Edition|last=Grant|first=August E.|last2=Meadows|first2=Jennifer H.|date=2016-11-03|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=|isbn=9781134987658|location=|pages=86|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 dispute between Time Warner Cable and Fox is an example of a carriage dispute involving an over-the-air broadcaster. The dispute pitted the second largest United States cable system against one of the four major U.S. television networks, whose broadcasts included the popular prime time series ''[[American Idol]]'' and [[National Football League]] games. Fox's then-parent company, [[News Corporation]] (which has since spun off the network and its cable channels to [[21st Century Fox]]), reportedly sought a monthly fee of $1 per subscriber; Time Warner offered 20 to 25 cents. Both companies mounted aggressive public relations campaigns, including dedicated websites and advertising. Fox suggested that viewers look into alternatives to Time Warner, including satellite and [[Verizon]]'s [[Verizon Fios|Fios]] service. Time Warner Cable countered that it was trying to reign in expenses that would ultimately be paid by subscribers. The companies ultimately settled close to the deadline, and, as is typical with carriage disputes, did not disclose the terms. The deal encouraged other over-the-air broadcasters to seek higher retransmission payments, thereby putting upward pressure on cable and satellite bills.&lt;ref name="TVNews Fox TW"&gt;{{cite news|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|title=Fox, TW go down to wire|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118013117?refcatid=14|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=TV News|date=December 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MDN TW Fox Fallout"&gt;{{cite news|last=Friedman|first=Wayne|title=Fallout: Time Warner, Fox Deal May Set Benchmark For Retrans Disputes| url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/120010/|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=MediaDailyNews|date=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes--ViacomDirecTV talks continue"&gt;{{cite news|last=Flint|first=Joe|title=Viacom and DirecTV continue to negotiate but remain far apart|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-viadirect-20120712,0,4033378.story|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PhilInquirer Viacom-DirecTV"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fernandez|first=Bob|title=Viacom-DirecTV cost dispute highlights concern over pay-TV's future|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20120712_Viacom-DirecTV_cost_dispute_highlights_concern_over_pay-TV_s_future.html|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 dispute between [[DirecTV]] and [[Viacom]] is an example of a dispute involving a non-terrestrial broadcaster. Viacom's cable/satellite channels, including [[Comedy Central]], [[Nickelodeon]] and [[MTV]], were blacked out for some 20 million DirecTV subscribers, who together represented about 20 percent of all U.S. households who subscribed to cable or satellite. DirecTV claimed Viacom was seeking a 30 percent fee hike, about $1 billion over five years. Viacom countered that while its channels represented 20 percent of total DirecTV viewing, the broadcaster received only 5 percent of the distributor's license fees. DirecTV argued that Viacom made too much of its content available for free on the Internet. Viacom responded that the practice was a marketing tool, although it pared that content back after the blackout. Also mentioned as a point of contention was Viacom's bundling of its co-owned channels – making them available to distributors only as a package rather than individually.&lt;ref name="NYT DirecTVvsViacom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USAToday DirecTVvViacom"&gt;{{cite news|last=Snider|first=Mike|title=Viacom channels are off DirecTV systems|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/telecom/story/2012-07-11/DirecTV-Viacom-channels/56149394/1|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=USAToday|date=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a sign of the increasing pressure on carriers to limit subscriber fees, DirecTV competitors did not mount advertising campaigns to attract disgruntled customers, and some competitors issued statements of support.&lt;ref name="wsjViacom"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramachandran|first1=Shalini|last2=Jannarone|first2=John|title=Viacom to Restore DirecTV Channels|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444464304577538492034772130|accessdate=20 July 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viacom and DirecTV resolved the dispute with a seven-year contract nine days later. Financial terms were not disclosed, though one analyst estimated Viacom would receive around $2.85 per subscriber, up from $2.25. In a first for Viacom, the company also agreed to give DirecTV customers access to live feeds on mobile devices.&lt;ref name="LATimes DirecTV Viacom settle"&gt;{{cite news|last=Flint|first=Joe|title=DirecTV and Viacom reach deal, end blackout|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-0721-ct-directv-viacom-settle-20120721,0,3067559.story|accessdate=22 July 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, a carriage dispute can last for months or even years. In September 2012, Time Warner Cable and the [[National Football League]] ended a nine-year dispute primarily over [[NFL Network]], and later, [[NFL Network#NFL RedZone Channel|NFL RedZone Channel]]. The deal followed an earlier settlement between the NFL and Cablevision, making Time Warner the last major holdout. Time Warner had offered to carry NFL Network on a narrower sports tier and argued that the relative scarcity of annual games–eight, expanded to 13–did not justify the cost. SNL Kagan estimated the average subscriber fee at 95 cents per month.&lt;ref name="Adweek:NFL-Time Warner"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crupi|first=Anthony|title=NFL Network in Carriage Talks With Time Warner Cable|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/nfl-network-carriage-talks-time-warner-cable-133867|accessdate=6 July 2012|newspaper=Adweek|date=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg NFL-TW resolved"&gt;{{cite news |last=Soshnick |first=Scott |title=NFL Reaches Agreement With Time Warner on NFL Network, RedZone |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-09-21/nfl-said-to-have-deal-with-time-warner-for-nfl-network-redzone |accessdate=7 January 2013 |newspaper=Bloomberg News |date=September 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107204400/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-09-21/nfl-said-to-have-deal-with-time-warner-for-nfl-network-redzone |archivedate=7 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-TW NFL settle"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|title=Time Warner Will Carry NFL Network|url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/time-warner-is-said-to-agree-to-carry-nfl-network/|accessdate=7 January 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some prolonged disputes are influenced by outside people and organizations. In 2003, New York City Mayor [[Michael R. Bloomberg]] helped arrange a deal between Cablevision and [[YES Network]], which had kept many [[New York Yankees]] baseball games from being seen by some 3 million local subscribers for the first year of YES Network's run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|title=BASEBALL; Cablevision Agrees to Carry the YES Network|accessdate=12 July 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/13/sports/baseball-cablevision-agrees-to-carry-the-yes-network.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 13, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Terranova|first=Justin|title=YES Network marks 10th anniversary|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/more_sports/yes_and_it_counts_8Hk0ERY7IHzVFUo94EmuON|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=New York Post|date=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[EchoStar]] dropped the female-oriented channel [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] for a competing channel, [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]]. While Lifetime is partially owned by Disney, which in turn owns ESPN and ABC, the deciding factor for contract renewal came less from the parent company's clout than from a letter writing campaign spurred by the [[National Organization for Women]], the [[YWCA]], and other groups.&lt;ref name="McMurria" /&gt;

Blackouts have occasionally extended to broadcasters' websites. In the summer of 2013, CBS blocked access to all Time Warner Cable subscribers, whether or not they lived in the disputed regions. In 2014, Viacom blocked streaming video access to Cable One customers.  Broadcasters argued that the practice closes a loophole: if distributors are to feel pressure from their subscribers, those subscribers shouldn't be able to view the content elsewhere. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] Chairman [[Tom Wheeler]] said the practice of extending blackouts to the Internet is of broad concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-fcc-chairman-expresses-concern-about-tv-networks-blocking-websites-20140520-story.html#navtype=outfit|title = FCC chairman expresses concern about TV networks blocking websites|last = Flint|first = Joe|date = May 20, 2014|work = Los Angeles Times|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A February 2015 carriage dispute between [[Fox Sports 1]] and [[AT&amp;T U-verse]] produced a rare example of a partial blackout. When the parties couldn't agree, the channel did not disappear entirely from the U-verse lineup.  Instead, the blackout only extended to some programing, including [[NASCAR]] events, [[Major League Soccer]] matches, and [[USGA]] golf events. FS1 had added most of these events after its launch and maintained it was only seeking to get paid for the added value provided. AT&amp;T U-verse called the additional fees "unreasonable".&lt;ref name=variety-uverseblackout&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox Sports 1, AT&amp;T In Dispute Over Fees For Nascar, Golf, Soccer|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/fox-sports-1-att-in-dispute-over-fees-for-nascar-golf-soccer-1201443261/|website=Variety|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aereo ====
{{main|American Broadcasting Companies v. Aereo}}

In 2012, a carriage dispute of a different sort arose between [[Aereo]], a small New York-based program distributor, and several major broadcasters, including [[CBS]], [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[Univision]] and [[PBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.eff.org/document/second-circuit-injunction-opinion-wnet-v-aereo|title = Second Circuit Injunction Opinion in WNET v. Aereo|date = August 30, 2012|publisher = U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (posted by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aereo used banks of small antennas to receive over-the-air signals from broadcasters, then made those signals available to subscribers via the Internet. But unlike other distributors, the company argued that, as an "antenna technology" company, it was exempt from paying retransmission consent fees, just as is any home viewer employing an antenna. Broadcasters countered that the Aereo service went beyond the conventional antenna because it both recorded programs for later viewing and charged subscribers a monthly fee, thus acting as a middleman. Aereo won its case in all but one lower court proceeding, including an April 1, 2013 ruling by the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref name="NYT Aereo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stelter|first=Brian|title=Aereo Wins a Court Battle, Dismaying Broadcasters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/business/media/aereo-wins-in-appeals-court-setting-stage-for-trial-on-streaming-broadcast-tv.html|accessdate=9 April 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Carr-Aereo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Carr|first=David|title=Spreading Disruption, Shaking Up Cable TV|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/business/media/barry-dillers-aereo-service-challenges-cable-television.html|accessdate=9 April 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR-Aereo&gt;{{cite news|last=Bobkoff|first=David|title=Startup CEO Wields Small Antenna In TV Streaming Battle|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/04/12/176979130/Startup-CEO-Wields-Small-Antenna-In-TV-Streaming-Battle|accessdate=12 April 2013|newspaper=National Public Radio|date=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times: Case to the People"&gt;{{cite news|last=Flint|first=Joe|title=Aereo takes its case to the people as broadcasters press on in court|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-aereo-ad-campaign-20130417,0,1535952.story|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aereo injunction in Utah"&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Ted |title=Utah Federal Judge Halts Aereo in Salt Lake City and Denver |newspaper=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |url=https://variety.com/2014/biz/news/utah-federal-judge-halts-aereo-in-salt-lake-city-and-denver-1201112853/ |date=February 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aereo stay injunction"&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Ted |title=Aereo Granted Two-Week Reprieve As It Appeals Utah Ruling |url=https://variety.com/2014/biz/news/aereo-granted-two-week-reprieve-as-it-appeals-utah-ruling-1201120992/ |newspaper=''Variety'' |date=February 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But in a 6-3 decision issued on June 25, 2014, the Supreme Court sided with the broadcasters, ruling that Aereo had violated copyright laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/supreme-court-rules-against-startup-aereo-saying-it-is-violating-copyright-laws/2014/06/25/59756f88-fc6b-11e3-8176-f2c941cf35f1_story.html|title = Supreme Court rules against start-up Aereo, saying it is violating copyright laws|last = Markon|first = Jerry|date = June 25, 2014|work = The Washington Post|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proposed legislation ===
Some legislators have sought to dampen the effects of carriage disputes on subscribers by giving more power to the Federal Communications Commission. In 2010, then Senator [[John Kerry]] introduced draft legislation that would have given the FCC more oversight responsibility, with the power to monitor negotiations and impose binding arbitration if it deems discussions between broadcasters and distributors are not being carried out in [[wikt:good faith|good faith]].&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt; In 2013, Representatives [[Anna Eshoo]] and [[Zoe Lofgren]] introduced the Video CHOICE (Consumers Have Options in Choosing Entertainment) Act, which would have enabled the FCC to prohibit channel blackouts during a dispute. The bill would also have prohibited broadcast channels from negotiating for carriage of its non-broadcast channels.&lt;ref name="LA Times: Proposed Bills"&gt;{{cite news|last=Flint|first=Joe|title=Proposed bills seek to rewrite media rulebook|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-proposed-bills-media-rules-20131212,0,2826769.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day the Video CHOICE legislation was introduced, Representative [[Steve Scalise]] reintroduced legislation first drafted in 2011: the Next Generation Television Marketplace Act. The legislation, more far-reaching than CHOICE, would have repealed key provisions of the 1992 Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act, including "[[Must-carry|must carry]]" and [[retransmission consent]] requirements, as well as [[Compulsory license|compulsory copyright licenses]] stemming from 1976 copyright law. The legislative intent was that carriage negotiations for broadcast stations should play out on the same terms as those for non-terrestrial channels. Both bills, while given only narrow chances of passage, were generally welcomed by distributors and criticized by broadcasters.&lt;ref name="LA Times: Proposed Bills" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B&amp;C: Scalise bill"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eggerton|first=John|title=Scalise Reintroduces Video Reform Bill|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/scalise-reintroduces-video-reform-bill/127941|newspaper=Broadcast &amp; Cable|date=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B&amp;C: Compulsory licenses"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eggerton|first=John|title=Padden: Get Rid of Compulsory License and Retrans|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/padden-get-rid-compulsory-license-and-retrans/60412|newspaper=Broadcast &amp; Cable|date=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tradeoffs, consequences==
As with all negotiations, carriage disputes involve tradeoffs for both parties. Distributors must weigh the effect of the carriage fees they pay on both their revenues and the fees they pass on to subscribers. Distributors also risk antagonizing their subscribers if they drop one or more channels from their lineup. For their part, broadcasters risk losing viewers, which in turn can reduce revenues from commercials and per-subscriber carriage fees. Financial consequences can ensue. Dish Network lost 156,000 customers in the fourth quarter of 2011 after a carriage dispute with Fox resulted in a loss of Fox Sports programming in October.&lt;ref name="Variety Dish Network loses"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowry|first=Tom|title=Dish Network loses subscribers|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118032821|accessdate=6 July 2012|newspaper=Variety|date=February 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMC Networks' stock dropped by nearly five percent after the network's programming was dropped by Dish at the end of June 2012.&lt;ref name="Variety:AMC"&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldsmith|first=Jill|title=AMC Networks stock drops 5%: News of AT&amp;T carriage dispute on top of Dish feud hits company|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-201206281659reedbusivarietynvr1118056089-20120628,0,3626937.story|accessdate=6 July 2012|newspaper=Variety|date=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For distributors, much of the calculation hinges on whether programming content is so compelling that it is worth the retransmission fee. Sports programming provides a good example of how the calculation may favor either party.

In a 2013 dispute between CBS and Time Warner Cable, CBS's bargaining position improved as the National Football League season approached. In the wake of the settlement, the broadcaster increased its per [[subscriber]] fee from an estimated $.58 to between $1 and $2, setting a new standard for retransmission fees commanded by over-the-air broadcasters. CBS also retained digital rights to its contents for resale to online distributors. The agreement was expected to earn the broadcaster an estimated $1 billion to $2 billion in additional revenues by 2017.&lt;ref name="NYT: CBS triumphant"&gt;{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Bill|title=CBS Returns, Triumphant, to Cable Box|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/business/media/cbs-and-time-warner-cable-end-contract-dispute.html?_r=0|accessdate=3 September 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://advanced-television.com/2013/08/30/analysis-changing-economics-of-retrans/|title = Analysis: Changing economics of retrans|date = September 2, 2013|website = Advanced Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters CBS squeezes"&gt;{{cite news|title=CBS win squeezes Time Warner Cable's margins: analysts|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/09/03/us-cbs-timewarner-idINBRE9810O720130903|accessdate=3 September 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=September 3, 2013|author=Grover, Ronald|author2=Baker, Liana B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Sherman |first=Alex |title=CBS Deal Ends Time Warner Cable Blackout Ahead of NFL |date=September 3, 2013 |url=http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-02/cbs-reaches-accord-to-end-blackout-on-time-warner-cable.html |publisher=Bloomberg |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016073837/http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-02/cbs-reaches-accord-to-end-blackout-on-time-warner-cable.html |archivedate=2013-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HollywoodRep-TW CBS could set standard"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ben Block|first=Alex|title=How the Time Warner Cable, CBS Strandoff Could Set the TV Standard|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-time-warner-cable-cbs-613713|accessdate=3 September 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Bold Play by CBS Fortifies Broadcasters|date = September 6, 2013|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/07/business/media/bold-play-by-cbs-fortifies-broadcasters.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0&amp;hp|publisher = |last = Carter|first = Bill|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some [[regional sports networks]] have seemingly overplayed their hand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[CSN Houston]], a partnership between the [[Houston Rockets]], the [[Houston Astros]] and [[Comcast]], was subsequently placed under bankruptcy protection after its October 2012 debut. While Comcast carried the channel, DirecTV, Dish Network and other competitors did not, citing the fee: $3.40 per month, one of the highest of any comparable channel. As a result, CSN Houston was unavailable to about 60% of the region's households. The owner of the Astros subsequently dropped high-salaried players, and the team finished the 2013 season with the worst record in baseball.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/houston-teams-want-potential-buyers-for-sports-channel-kept-confidential-1405368455|title = Houston Teams Want Potential Buyers for Sports Channel Kept Secret|last = Stetch|first = Katy|date = July 14, 2014|work = The Wall Street Journal|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/morning_call/2014/03/comcast-sportsnet-houstons-bankruptcy-case-headed.html|title = Comcast SportsNet Houston's bankruptcy case headed to mediation|last = Pulsinelli|first = Olivia|date = March 21, 2014|work = Houston Business Journal|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, [[Time Warner Cable Arena|Time Warner Cable]] signed an $8.35 billion, 25-year contract with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] to carry and resell the Dodger-owned [[SportsNet LA]]. But in the 2014 season, the channel was only carried by TWC itself and a few smaller distributors, leaving about 70% of the region uncovered. TWC had reportedly asked other distributors for an initial $4 to $5 per-month per-subscriber, with carriage fees increasing yearly over the length of the contract. Those distributors, most notably DirecTV, balked at the terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-dodgers-channel-launch-20140224,0,4524006.story|title=Dodger channel debuts Tuesday but much of region will be shut out|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Joe|last=Flint|date=February 24, 2014|accessdate=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lat-directv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Warner Cable says talks with DirecTV for Dodgers channel are over|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-time-warner-cable-says-talks-with-directv-for-dodger-channel-are-over-20140403,0,6994648.story|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Los Angeles Times business reporter Joe Flint called the standoff a potentially "definitive moment for the world of sports programming, as the industry realizes that exorbitantly priced television deals can backfire."&lt;ref name="Flint 7/14"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-dodgers-tv-standoff-20140718-story.html?track=rss#page=1|title = Standoff over Dodgers games could be defining moment in sports TV|last = Flint|first = Joe|date = July 17, 2014|work = Los Angeles Times|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other teams with whose regional sports networks did not gain traction include the [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Minnesota Twins]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some smaller cable companies, relying on revenues from broadband subscriptions, have been more willing to drop a bundled service, even at the cost of fewer television subscribers.  In 2014, for example, [[Suddenlink]], the seventh largest U.S. cable provider, entered into a lengthy dispute with Viacom, which continued even though Suddenlink lost 32,600 television subscribers over the first three months. But the company's net income was up 65 percent over the same period the previous year because it retained most of those subscribers as broadband customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/business/media/betting-against-the-cable-bundle.html|title = Provider’s Dispute With Viacom Highlights Skirmish Over the Cable Bundle|last = Steel|first = Emily|date = March 8, 2015|work = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict was only resolved in May 2017, after [[Altice USA]] purchased Suddenlink and came to a new carriage agreement with Viacom which also encompassed Altice's New York metro Optimum service.

'''Cognitive phonology''' is usually thought of as the study of the 'sound systems' of languages. It is an attempt to classify various correspondences between [[morphemes]] and [[phonetic sequence]]s and is a part of [[cognitive grammar]]. One attractive feature of cognitive phonology is that other aspects of grammar are directly accessible due to its subordinate relationship with cognitive grammar; thus making relationships between phonology and various aspects of syntax, semantics and pragmatics feasible.

Computational semantics has points of contact with the areas of [[lexical semantics]] ([[word sense disambiguation]] and [[semantic role labeling]]), discourse semantics, [[knowledge representation]] and [[automated reasoning]] (in particular, [[automated theorem proving]]). Since 1999 there has been an [[Association for Computational Linguistics|ACL]] special interest group on computational semantics, SIGSEM.

'''Cyprus''' or '''Cypriot Sign Language''' ({{lang-el|Κυπριακή Νοηματική Γλώσσα}}) is an incipient [[sign language]] of Cyprus. It appears to be a pidgin of [[American Sign Language]] and [[Greek Sign Language]], not yet a fully developed language. The Greek Cypriot deaf community predominantly uses the [[Greek Sign Language]] (the Turkish Cypriot deaf community uses the [[Turkish Sign Language]]).&lt;ref&gt;Timmermans, 2005, ''The Status of Sign Languages in Europe''&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of the resolution, in 1999, the General Assembly, led by the representative from the Dominican Republic, designated 25 November as the [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]].

==Background==
The international recognition that women have a right to a life free from violence is a recent one. Historically, their struggles with violence, and with the impunity that often protects the perpetrators, is linked with their fight to overcome discrimination. Since its founding the United Nations has concerned itself with the [[Division for the Advancement of Women|advancement of women's rights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/events/women/iwd/2007/pdf/background.pdf|title=Ending Impunity for Violence Against Women and Girls|publisher=United Nations Department of Public Information|date=March 2007|accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not specifically target the high rates of female targeted violence until 1993. One of the aims of the resolution was to overturn the prevailing governmental stance that violence against women was a private, domestic matter not requiring state intervention. To mark [[International Women's Day]] on 8 March 1993, General Secretary, [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], issued a statement in preparation of the declaration explicitly outlining the UN's role in the 'promotion' and 'protection' of women's rights:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The struggle for women's rights, and the task of creating a new United Nations, able to promote peace and the values which nurture and sustain it, are one and the same. Today - more than ever - the cause of women is the cause of all humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

 |date=1993
 |work=un.org (WomenWatch)
 |accessdate=24 February 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Definition of Violence Against Women==
Articles 1 and 2 of the resolution provide the most widely used definition of violence against women.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Article One:
For the purposes of this Declaration, the term "[[violence against women]]" means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Article Two:
Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following:

:(a)   Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including [[Battery (crime)|battering]], [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse of female children]] in the household, [[dowry]]-related violence, [[marital rape]], [[female genital mutilation]] and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to [[Sexual exploitation|exploitation]];
:(b)   Physical, sexual and [[psychological abuse|psychological violence]] occurring within the general community, including [[rape]], [[sexual abuse]], [[sexual harassment]] and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] in women and [[forced prostitution]];
:(c)   Physical, sexual and psychological violence perpetrated or condoned by the State, wherever it occurs.&lt;ref name="un-documents.net"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women==
As a consequence of the declaration on 4 March 1994, the Commission on Human Rights adopted Resolution 1994/45&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
 |url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/CHR/resolutions/E-CN_4-RES-1994-45.doc

 |work=ohchr.org
 |accessdate=June 24, 2017
}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which it decided to appoint [[Radhika Coomaraswamy]] as its first [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on [[Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women|Violence Against Women]], including its causes and consequences. The Special Rapporteur has a mandate to collect and analyse data from governments, treaty bodies, specialized agencies, NGOs, and other interested parties, and to respond effectively to such information. Furthermore, they also have a role in making recommendations on an international, national and regional level, as well as liaising with other Special Rapporteurs, special representatives, working groups and independent experts of the Commission on Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

 |title=Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences
 |work=www2.ohchr.org
 |accessdate=February 24, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 June 2009 the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] appointed [[Rashida Manjoo]] as the third incumbent of the role after the tenure of her predecessor, Dr. Yakin Erturk, came to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

 |accessdate=June 3, 2017
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==
Many advocates of Women's Rights as Human Rights have expressed concerns that much of the ground gained by the declaration has been threatened by the rise of more conservative forces within the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2003, during a meeting of the [[UN Commission on the Status of Women]] the delegate from Iran objected to the inclusion of a paragraph that called on governments to "condemn violence against women and refrain from invoking any custom, tradition, or religious consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to its elimination as set out in the Declaration of the Elimination of Violence against Women." Representatives from Egypt, Pakistan, Sudan and US also raised objections; making it the first ever diplomatic failure at the UN Commission on the Status of Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Campaigns==
Each year, the [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]] marks the start of [[16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unifem]], Women Won't Wait, Women for a Change, [[Women's Aid]], and other groups join together to speak out against gender violence and to promote the rights and principles of the declaration.
On 10 April 2009, [[Amnesty International]] held a demonstration in [[Narayangarh, Chitwan|Narayanghat]], [[Nepal]], to highlight the plight of women's rights activists after the Nepalese state failed to protect two activists from violent attacks and, finally, their murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite ratifying the declaration, Nepal had failed to abide by Article 4-c which asserts the clear obligation of states to: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and, in accordance with national legislation, punish acts of violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by the State or by private persons."&lt;ref name="un-documents.net"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Its visual appearance is inspired by these, including the traditional [[litema]] arts style.&lt;ref&gt;[https://matthewdea.com/blog/2017/5/12/writing-systems-of-africa  Writing Systems] (12 May 2017) "Perhaps the most contemporary and creative African script is known as Ditema Tsa Dinoko (Isibheqe Sohlamvu in Zulu). This script can be used to write any Southern Bantu language, such as Sesotho, Zulu, and Tswana. The Southern Bantu languages are found in South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. Created within the past three years by linguists, programmers, and designers, this special writing system is inspired by traditional litema art of Lesotho."

The Ditema / Isibheqe syllabary has the capacity to represent the full phonological range of these ''sintu'' languages (in the [[Nguni languages|Nguni]], [[Sotho-Tswana languages|Sotho-Tswana]], [[Venda language|Venḓa]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]] and [[Guitonga language (Mozambique)|Tonga-Inhambane]] groups) consistently under one [[orthography]].&lt;ref name=isibheqe.org&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isibheqe.org |title=Isibheqe Sohlamvu/Ditema tsa Dinoko |author=isibheqe.org |year=2015 |publisher=isibheqe.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This includes languages that are unstandardised in the [[Latin alphabet]] such as the [[Pulana language|East Sotho languages]] (Sepulana, Sekutswe and Hipai), or the [[Tekela languages]], which, with the exception of [[Swazi language|SiSwati]], are not official languages. Orthographic support for these languages is for instance evidenced in the ''ingungwana'' [[grapheme]], which indicates [[nasal vowel|vowel nasality]] — a feature of Tekela languages.

[[File:Ditema-tsa-dinoko_s_c_(1).jpg|thumb|left|''Ditema tsa Dinoko'', read left-to-right. The three syllables of first word are clustered, with the third syllable on the bottom]]

==Description==
The script operates as a [[syllabary]], as each freestanding symbol represents a [[syllable]], with [[graphemes]] for consonant and vowel sounds combined together into syllable blocks (''amabheqe''), in a similar fashion to [[Hangeul]]. When the syllable being represented is not a [[syllabic consonant|syllabic nasal]], these symbols are formed from a triangular or [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron-shaped]] grapheme representing the [[Nucleus (syllable)|nucleus]] of the syllable, with the attached ''ongwaqa'' or consonant graphemes representing the [[onset (linguistics)|onset]] of the syllable or its mode of articulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isibheqe.org/ingcazo.html |title=Ingcazo |website=isibheqe.org |access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syllabic nasals are represented as circles that fill the whole ''ibheqe'' or syllable block.

[[File:Xilo_Vhathu_Ho_tlêtse.jpg|thumb|right|''The construction of the syllables of three words in different languages: &lt;Xilo&gt; [ʃiːlɔ] "thing" in Xitsonga, &lt;Vhathu&gt; [βaːtʰu] "people" in Tshivenḓa, &lt;Ho tlêtse&gt; [hʊt͜ɬ’ɛːt͜s’ɪ] "It is full" in Sesotho.]]

==Vowels==

The vowel graphemes (''onkamisa'') form the basis of each ''ibheqe'' or syllable block, as the nucleus of each syllable, with the ''ongwaqa'' or consonant graphemes positioned in and around them. 

The direction of each ''ibheqe'' indicates the quality of the vowel for each of the seven vowel [[phonemes]]:

•     ''Intombi'', the upward facing triangle: /i/

•     ''Isoka'', the downward facing triangle: /a/

•     ''Umkhonto'', the upward facing chevron: /u/

•     The leftward facing triangle: /ɛ/ 

•     The rightward facing triangle: /ɔ/

•     The leftward facing chevron: /e/ 

•     The rightward facing chevron: /o/

There is an eighth "vowel" represented by the downward facing chevron, which is an ''empty vowel'', and is mostly used for foreign words to represent a standalone consonant, often as a [[syllable coda]], which does not occur in sintu languages having CV phonology.

[[File:Onkamisa (AmaBheqe).jpg|''Onkamisa'', vowel graphemes.]]

The apex of the triangle or chevron corresponds to vowel height or frontedness, with [[high vowel|high vowels]] /i/ and /u/ pointing upwards and the [[low vowel]] /a/ pointing downwards. Likewise, the [[front vowel|front vowels]] /ɛ/ and /e/ point leftwards and the [[back vowel|back vowels]] /ɔ/ and /o/ point rightwards. 

[[File:Onkamisa (Emlonyeni).jpg]]

Vowel nasality is indicated with the ''ingungwana'' grapheme, which is a solid dot outside the triangle separated from the apex, as in the word ''phãsi'' below:

==Consonants==

Consonants (''ongwaqa'') are composed of one or more graphemes, at least one of which indicates the place and manner of articulation and thereafter they represent co-articulations or onset clusters and the articulatory mode, whether it be [[voiced]], [[prenasalised]], [[implosive]], [[ejective]], [[modal voice|modal]], or a combination thereof.

The position of the consonant graphemes largely corresponds to the [[place of articulation]]:

•     [[labial consonant|Labials]] and [[Nasal consonant|nasals]] are positioned outside the triangle at the apex.

• [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolars]] are across the middle of the triangle from side to side.

• [[Velar consonant|Velars]] and [[Palatal consonant|palatals]] are at the base.

• [[lateral consonant|Laterals]] are outside the triangle on one side. 

• [[dental consonant|Dentals]] are two lines across the triangle from side to side, parallel to each other.

The shape of the consonant grapheme corresponds to the [[manner of articulation]]:

• Curved lines indicate [[fricatives]].

• Their straight line counterparts in the same positions indicate [[plosives]]. 

• [[Approximants]] and [[Trill consonant|trills]] are represented with two lines either parallel or at a right angle to each other, with a [[Flap consonant|tap or flap]] being the latter arrangement, one line bisecting the other at its centrepoint without crossing it. 

• [[Retroflex]] whistled consonants and [[postalveolar]] fricatives are represented as loops. 

• [[Nasal consonant|Nasals]] are represented as circles at the apex of the triangle. Lines inside the circles distinguish the nasals from each other.

• [[click consonant|Clicks]] are a bottomless hourglass shape.

• Syllabic laterals and trills are represented with duplication of the ordinary lateral and trill graphemes.

Syllabic nasals or ''amaqanda'' are unique in that they occupy the entire ''ibheqe'' space as circles. They are distinguished from each other with lines inside them that operate according to the same principles as above. 

These graphemes can combine with each other in an order in accordance with the [[phonotactics]] of sintu languages, and they also can combine with the articulatory mode graphemes. 

[[File:Ongwaqa.png]]

==Articulatory mode==

[[File:Articulatory mode.png|thumb|right|]]

There are three graphemic markers of articulatory mode:
 
• For unvoiced consonants, a solid dot within the triangle indicates a glotallised ([[ejective consonant|ejected]]) consonant or a modal click consonant.

• For voiced consonants the solid dot inside the triangle indicates an [[implosive]] consonant or, in the case of languages where there are no implosives, a modal consonant.

• The absence of the dot indicates [[breathy voice]] in the case of voiced consonants, and [[aspirated consonant|aspiration]] in the case of voiceless consonants.

• ''Uphimbo'', or the voicing line, running from the apex of the triangle to the base (or until inline with the ends of the chevron), indicates consonant [[voiced consonant|voicing]]. 

• If the voicing line occurs as the only ''ungwaqa'' in the ''ibheqe'', it indicates a [[voiced glottal fricative]] /ɦ/. 

• In languages that distinguish between breathy voiced and modal nasals/trills, the voicing line indicates breathy voice when occurring with these consonant graphemes.

• [[Prenasalized consonant|Prenasalised consonants]] are marked with an open circle at the apex of the triangle called ''ingungu''. These occur with other consonant graphemes, and are distinct from the [[bilabial nasal]] /m/ that occurs on its own. No additional lines need be added to the ''ingungu'' when it occurs with other ''ongwaqa'' as the place of articulation is given by them and need not be marked in the nasal grapheme. 

• For clicks, the ''ingungu'' marks a [[nasal click consonant]], with the prenasalised clicks (e.g. &lt;nkq&gt;) requiring the addition of a solid dot (glottalisation), in which case the ''ingungu'' denotes prenasalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isibheqe.org/ingcazo |title=Incazo Yohlelo |publisher=isibheqe.org |date=23 August 2015 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 9 vowels and 36 diphthongs, 28 of which are native to Estonian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ross|Lehiste|2001|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; All nine vowels can appear as the first component of a diphthong, but only {{IPA|/ɑ e i o u/}} occur as the second component. A vowel characteristic of Estonian is the unrounded back vowel {{IPA|/ɤ/}}, which may be [[close-mid back unrounded vowel|close-mid back]], [[close back unrounded vowel|close back]], or [[close-mid central unrounded vowel|close-mid central]].&lt;ref name="Asu 2009 369"/&gt;

There are very few instances of vowel [[allophony]]; for instance, the long {{IPA|/y/}} is pronounced as the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|[yi]}} in certain{{which|date=May 2017}} environments.

Simple vowels can be inherently short or long, written with single and double vowel letters respectively. Diphthongs are always inherently long. Furthermore, long vowels and diphthongs have two [[suprasegmental]] lengths. This is described [[#Prosody|further below]].

* {{IPA|/m, p, pː/}} are [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]], whereas {{IPA|/f, v, fː/}} are [[Labiodental consonant|labiodental]].&lt;ref name="Asu 2009 367"/&gt;
* The fricatives {{IPA|/f, ʃ/}} appear only in loanwords. Some speakers {{IPA|/ʃ/}} merge with {{IPA|/s/}} to {{IPAblink|s}}.&lt;ref name="Asu 2009 368"/&gt;
* {{IPA|/n/}} is realized as velar {{IPAblink|ŋ}} before a velar consonant (e.g. ''panga'' {{IPA|/pɑnkɑ/}} {{IPA|[pɑŋɡ̊ɑ]}} 'bank [gen.sg.]').&lt;ref name="Asu 2009 368"/&gt;
* {{IPA|/k, kː/}} are [[Velar consonant|velar]], whereas {{IPA|/j/}} is [[Palatal consonant|palatal]].&lt;ref name="Asu 2009 367"/&gt;
** When it appears between non-high vowels, the intervocalic {{IPA|/j/}} can be realized as a non-syllabic close-mid front unrounded vowel {{IPA|[e̯]}}.&lt;ref name="Asu 2009 368"/&gt;
* The stops are voiceless unaspirated, but the short versions can be partially {{IPA|[p̬, t̬, t̬ʲ, k̬]}} or fully {{IPA|[{{IPA link|b}}, {{IPA link|d}}, dʲ, {{IPA link|ɡ}}]}} voiced when they appear between vowels.&lt;ref name="Asu 2009 367"/&gt;
* In spontaneous speech, word-initial {{IPA|/h/}} is usually [[H-dropping|dropped]]. It is mostly retained in formal speech, and can be realized as voiced {{IPAblink|ɦ}} between two voiced sounds.&lt;ref name="Asu 2009 368"/&gt;

Like the vowels, most consonants can be inherently short or long. For the plosives, this distinction is reflected as a distinction in tenseness/voicing, with short plosives being voiced and long plosives being voiceless. This distinction only applies fully for single consonants after stressed syllables. In other environments, the length or tenseness/voicing distinctions may be neutralised:
* After unstressed syllables or in consonant clusters, only obstruents can be long, other consonants are always short.
* In consonant clusters, voiced plosives are devoiced when next to another obstruent. That is, voiced plosives only occur next to a vowel or a sonorant.
* Word-initially, obstruents are always voiceless, while the remaining consonants are always short. Recent loanwords may have voiced initial plosives, however.

In addition, long consonants and clusters also have two suprasegmental lengths, like the vowels. This is described [[#Prosody|below]].

Non-phonemic [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] generally occurs before front vowels. In addition, about 0.15% of the vocabulary features fully phonemic palatalization, where palatalization occurs without the front vowel. A front vowel did historically occur there, but was lost, leaving the palatalization as its only trace (a form of [[cheshirization]]).{{examples needed|date=October 2016}} It mostly occurs word-finally, but in some cases it may also occur word-medially. Thus, palatalization does not necessarily need a front vowel, and palatalized vs. plain continuants can be articulated. Palatalization is not indicated in the standard orthography.

==Prosody==
The stress in Estonian is usually on the first syllable, as was the case in [[Proto-Finnic]]. There are a few exceptions with the stress on the second syllable: ''aitäh'' ('thanks'), ''sõbranna'' ('female friend'). In loanwords, the original stress can be borrowed as well: ''ideaal'' ('ideal'), ''professor'' ('professor'). The stress is weak, and as length levels already control an aspect of "articulation intensity", most words appear evenly stressed.

Syllables can be divided into short and long. Syllables ending in a short vowel are short, while syllables ending in a long vowel, diphthong or consonant are long. The length of vowels, consonants and thus syllables is "inherent" in the sense that it is tied to a particular word and is not subject to morphological alternations.

===Suprasegmental length===

All stressed long syllables can possess a suprasegmental length feature. When a syllable has this feature, any long vowel or diphthong in the syllable is lengthened further, as is any long consonant or consonant cluster at the end of that syllable. A long syllable without suprasegmental length is termed "long", "half-long", "light" or "length II" and is denoted in IPA as {{angbr|ˑ}} or {{angbr|ː}}. A long syllable with suprasegmental length is termed "overlong", "long", "heavy" or "length III", denoted in IPA as {{angbr|ː}} or {{angbr|ːː}}. For consistency, this article employs the terms "half-long" and "overlong" and uses {{angbr|ː}} and {{angbr|ːː}}, respectively, to denote them.

Both the regular short-long distinction and the suprasegmental length are distinctive, so that Estonian effectively has three distinctive vowel and consonant lengths, the distinction between the second and third length levels being at a level larger than the phoneme, such as the syllable or the [[Foot (prosody)|foot]].&lt;ref name="Prince 1980"&gt;{{harv|Prince|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to realizing greater phonetic duration, overlength in modern Estonian involves a [[Pitch accent|pitch distinction]] where falling pitch is realized in syllables that are overlong and level pitch is realized in syllables that are short or long.&lt;ref name="Lippus and Ross 2011"&gt;{{harv|Lippus|Ross|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suprasegmental length is not indicated in the standard orthography except for the plosives for which a single voiceless letter represents a half-long consonant while a double voiceless letter represents an overlong consonant. There are many minimal pairs and also some minimal triplets which differ only by length:&lt;ref name="Asu 2009 369"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Asu|Teras|2009|p=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''vere'' {{IPA|/vere/}} 'blood [gen.sg.]' (short) &amp;mdash; ''veere'' {{IPA|/veːre/}} 'edge [gen. sg.]' (long) &amp;mdash; ''veere'' {{IPA|/veːːre/}} 'edge [ptv. plural] ' but also 'roll [imp. 2nd sg.] ' (overlong)
* ''lina'' {{IPA|/linɑ/}} 'sheet' (short) &amp;mdash; ''linna'' {{IPA|/linːɑ/}} 'town [gen. sg.]' (long) &amp;mdash; ''linna'' {{IPA|/linːːɑ/}} 'town [ine. sg.]' (overlong)
* ''kabi'' {{IPA|/kɑpi/}} 'hoof' (short) &amp;mdash; ''kapi'' {{IPA|/kɑpːi/}} 'wardrobe [gen. sg.]' (long) &amp;mdash; ''kappi'' {{IPA|/kɑpːːi/}} 'wardrobe [ine. sg.]' (overlong)

The extra length distinction has a number of origins:
* Single-syllable words are always overlong, if they have a long syllable.
* Overlong syllables appear in strong-grade environments, while half-long syllables appear in weak-grade environments. This is traceable to an earlier (Proto-Finnic) distinction between open and closed syllables: closed syllables shortened and weakened a preceding syllable.
* Syncopation of a medial syllable lengthens the preceding syllable.
* When a consonant disappears altogether in the weak grade, coalescence of the two adjacent vowels produces an overlong syllable.
* [[Compensatory lengthening]] in the short illative singular form of nominals produces an overlong syllable, even from an originally short syllable.

{{Linguistics}}
{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Evolutionary linguistics''' is a subfield of [[psycholinguistics]] that studies the psychosocial and cultural factors involved in the [[origin of language]] and the development of [[linguistic universal]]s.&lt;ref name="Croft 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Croft | first = William |date=October 2008 | title = Evolutionary Linguistics | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 37 | pages = 219–234 | publisher = Annual Reviews | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085156 | url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main challenge in this research is the lack of empirical data: spoken [[language]] leaves practically no traces. This led to the abandonment of the field for more than a century, despite the common origins of language hinted at by the relationships among individual languages established by the field of [[historical linguistics]]. Since the late 1980s, the field has been revived in the wake of progress{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} made in the related fields of [[biolinguistics]], [[psycholinguistics]], [[neurolinguistics]], [[evolutionary anthropology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[universal grammar]], and [[cognitive science]].

==History==
Inspired by the natural sciences, especially by [[biology]], [[August Schleicher]] (1821–1868) became the first to compare changing languages to evolving [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;Taub, Liba. ''Evolutionary Ideas and "Empirical" Methods: The Analogy Between Language and Species in the Works of Lyell and Schleicher.'' British Journal for the History of Science 26, pages 171–193 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the representation of language families as an evolutionary tree (''Stammbaumtheorie'') in articles published in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Schleicher| first =  August | title = Darwinism tested by the science of language : Free Download  | url = https://archive.org/details/darwinismtestedb69schl | publisher = Internet Archive  | date = 1869 | accessdate = 11 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stammbaumtheorie'' proved very productive for [[comparative linguistics]], but did not solve the major problem of studying the [[origin of language]]: the lack of [[fossil]] records. Some scholars abandoned the question of the origin of language as unsolvable. Famously, the ''[[Société Linguistique de Paris]]'' in 1866 refused to admit any further papers on the subject.
[[Joseph Jastrow]] published a gestural theory of the evolution of language in the seventh volume of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 1886.&lt;ref name="Jastrow 1886"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jastrow J |title=The Evolution of Language |journal=Science |volume=7 |issue=176S |pages=555–557 |year=1886 |pmid=17778380 |doi=10.1126/science.ns-7.176S.555 |jstor=1761264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field re-appeared in 1988 in the ''[[Linguistic Bibliography]]'' as a subfield of [[psycholinguistics]]. In 1990, [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] published their paper "Natural Language and Natural Selection"&lt;ref name="Pinker Bloom 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|last2=Bloom|first2=Paul|title=Natural language and natural selection|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences| volume=13|issue=4| year=2011|pages=707–727 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00081061|url=http://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/~hoole/kurse/hs_evolution/pinkerbloom_bbs_13_4_1990.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which strongly argued for an [[adaptationist]] approach to language origins. Development strengthened further with the establishment (in 1996) of a series of conferences on the Evolution of Language (subsequently known as "Evolang"), promoting a scientific, multi-disciplinary approach to the issue, and interest from major academic publishers (e.g., the ''Studies in the Evolution of Language'' series has appeared with [[Oxford University Press]] since 2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Oxford Studies in the Evolution of Language | url = http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/category/academic/series/language/sel.do | publisher = Oxford University Press  | accessdate = 11 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and from scientific journals.

==Recent developments==
Evolutionary linguistics as a field is rapidly emerging as a result of developments in neighboring disciplines. To what extent language's features are determined by genes, a hotly debated dichotomy in linguistics, has had new light shed upon it by the discovery of the ''[[FOXP2]]'' [[gene]].&lt;ref name="Scharff 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scharff C, Haesler S |title=An evolutionary perspective on FoxP2: strictly for the birds? |journal=Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=694–703 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16266802 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2005.10.004 |url=|last2=Haesler }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scharff 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scharff C, Petri J |title=Evo-devo, deep homology and FoxP2: implications for the evolution of speech and language |journal=Philos.

If both copies are damaged, the [[Purkinje layer]] (a part of the [[cerebellum]] that contains better-connected neurons than any other) develops abnormally, [[runt]]ing is more common, and pups die within weeks due to inadequate lung development.&lt;ref name="Shu 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shu W, Lu MM, Zhang Y, Tucker PW, Zhou D, Morrisey EE | title = Foxp2 and Foxp1 cooperatively regulate lung and esophagus development | journal = Development | volume = 134 | issue = 10 | pages = 1991–2000 | date=May 2007| pmid = 17428829 | doi = 10.1242/dev.02846 | url = | issn = | last2 = Lu | last3 = Zhang | last4 = Tucker | last5 = Zhou | last6 = Morrisey }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, higher presence of ''FOXP2'' in songbirds is correlated to song changes, with [[Downregulation and upregulation|downregulation]] causing incomplete and inaccurate song imitation in [[Zebra Finch|zebra finches]]. In general, evidence suggests that the protein is vital to neuroplasticity. There is little support, however, for the idea that ''FOXP2'' is 'the grammar gene' or that it had much to do with the relatively recent emergence of syntactical speech.&lt;ref name="Diller 2009"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Diller | first1 = Karl C. |last2 = Cann | first2 =Rebecca L. |title = Evidence Against a Genetic-Based Revolution in Language 50,000 Years Ago |editors= Rudolf Botha and Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749 | pages =135–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversial dichotomy is the question of whether human language is solely human or on a continuum with (admittedly far removed) [[Animal communication|animal communication systems]]. Studies in [[ethology]] have forced researchers to reassess many claims of uniquely human abilities for language and speech. For instance, [[Tecumseh Fitch]] has argued that the [[Larynx#Descended larynx|descended larynx]] is not unique to humans. Similarly, once held uniquely human traits such as formant perception, combinatorial phonology and compositional semantics are now thought to be shared with at least some nonhuman animal species. Conversely, [[Derek Bickerton]] and others argue that the advent of abstract words provided a mental basis for analyzing higher-order relations, and that any communication system that remotely resembles human language utterly relies on cognitive architecture that co-evolved alongside language.

As it leaves no fossils, language's form and even its presence are extremely hard or impossible to deduce from physical evidence. Computational modeling is now widely accepted as an approach to assure the internal consistency of language-evolution scenarios. Approximately one-third of all papers presented at the 2010 Evolution of Language conference&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Evolang8 - Program | url = http://www.let.uu.nl/evolang2010.nl/evolang8program.html | publisher =  | date = 2010  | accessdate = 11 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rely at least in part on computer simulations.

==Approaches==
One original researcher in the field is [[Luc Steels]], head of the research units of Sony CSL in [[Paris]] and the AI Lab at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]. He and his team are currently investigating ways in which artificial agents self-organize languages with natural-like properties and how meaning can co-evolve with language. Their research is based on the hypothesis that language is a [[complex adaptive system]] that emerges through adaptive interactions between agents and continues to evolve in order to remain adapted to the needs and capabilities of the agents. This research has been implemented in [[fluid construction grammar]] (FCG), a formalism for construction grammars that has been specially designed for the origins and evolution of language. The approach of computational modeling and the use of robotic agents grounded in real life is claimed to be theory independent. It enables the researcher to find out exactly what cognitive capacities are needed for certain language phenomena to emerge. It also focuses the researcher in formulating hypotheses in a precise and exact manner, whereas theoretical models often stay very vague.

Some linguists, such as [[John McWhorter]], have analyzed the evolution and construction of basic [[communication]] methods such as [[pidgin]]ization and [[creolization]].&lt;ref name="McWhorter 2001"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = McWhorter | first1 = John H. | title = The power of Babel : a natural history of language | date = 2001 | publisher = Times Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-7167-4473-3 | oclc = 46564796 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Nativist" models of "[[universal grammar]]" are informed by [[linguistic universals]] such as the existence of [[pronoun]]s and [[demonstrative]]s, and the similarities in each language's process of [[nominalization]] (the process of [[verb]]s becoming [[noun]]s) as well as the reverse, the process of turning nouns into verbs.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 2005"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Deutscher | first1 = Guy | title = The unfolding of language : an evolutionary tour of mankind's greatest invention | date = 2005 | publisher = Metropolitan Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-8050-7907-4 | oclc = 57311730 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a purely descriptive approach to what we mean by "[[natural language]]" without attempting to address its emergence.

Finally there are those archaeologists and evolutionary anthropologists—among them Ian Watts,&lt;ref name="Watts 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last = Watts | first = Ian  |title=Red Ochre, Body Painting, and Language: Interpreting the Blombos Ochre |editors= Rudolf Botha and Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749 | pages =62–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camilla Power&lt;ref name="Power 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last = Power| first = Camilla |title=Sexual Selection Models for the Emergence of Symbolic Communication: Why They Should be Reversed |editors= Rudolf Botha and Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749| pages= 257–280}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chris Knight (anthropologist)|Chris Knight]] (co-founder with [[James Hurford]] of the EVOLANG series of conferences)—who argue that 'the origin of language' is probably an insoluble problem. In agreement with [[Amotz Zahavi]],&lt;ref name="Zahavi 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zahavi A |title=The fallacy of conventional signalling |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. |volume=340 |issue=1292 |pages=227–30 |date=May 1993 |pmid=8101657 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1993.0061 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knight argues that language—being a realm of patent fictions—is a theoretical impossibility in a Darwinian world, where signals must be intrinsically reliable. If we are going to explain language's evolution, according to this view, we must tackle it as part of a wider one—the evolutionary emergence of [[symbolic culture]] as such.&lt;ref name="Knight 2009"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Knight| first1 =Chris| title=The origins of symbolic culture| editors = Ulrich J Frey; Charlotte Störmer; Kai P Willführ| work = Homo novus : a human without illusion | date = 2010 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin ; New York | isbn = 978-3-642-12141-8 | oclc = 639461749| url = http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/The-Origins-of-Symbolic-Culture.pdf |pages = 193–211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''haute-contre''' (plural hautes-contre) is a rare type of high [[tenor]] voice, predominant in French Baroque and Classical [[French opera|opera]] until the latter part of the eighteenth century.

==History==
The voice was predominantly used in male solo roles, typically heroic and amatory ones, but also in comic parts, even ''[[en travesti]]'' (see apropos the portrait reproduced below and representing [[Pierre Jélyotte]] made up for the female title role of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau|Rameau]]'s ''[[Platée]]''). [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]] wrote 8 out of 14 leading male roles for the voice; [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier|Charpentier]], who was an haute-contre himself, composed extensively for the voice-part, as did Rameau and, later, [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]. 

The leading ''hautes-contre'' of the ''[[Académie Royale de Musique]]'' that created the main roles of Lully's operas, at the end of the seventeenth century, were [[Bernard Clédière]] and [[Louis Gaulard Dumesny]]. Notable ''hautes-contre'' of the eighteenth century’s first half included firstly [[Jean-François Tribou]], who revived Lully style and operas in the twenties and in the thirties,&lt;ref&gt;Weller, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; then the mentioned Pierre Jélyotte and his substitutes, [[François Poirier]] et [[La Tour (tenor)|La Tour]], all of whom sang Rameau's operas and Lully's revivals for the ''Académie Royale de Musique'', and finally [[Marc-François Bêche]], who was engaged mainly in performances at court.&lt;ref name="Sawkins"&gt;Sawkins, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; After these came [[Joseph Legros]], for whom Gluck wrote his main ''haute-contre'' roles, which included the title role in the 1774 version of ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice|Orphée et Eurydice]]'', and Achilles in ''[[Iphigénie en Aulide]]''. There is also an extensive repertoire of music for this voice in French ''[[airs de cour]]'' and in French solo cantatas of the Baroque period; ''hautes-contre'' sang in choirs as well, taking the part above more ordinary tenors, who were designated as ''taille''.
[[File:Jelyotte as Platee.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Jélyotte in the title-role of Rameau's ''Platée'', by [[Charles-Antoine Coypel]] c.1745]]

==Vocal features==
The nature of the ''haute-contre'' voice has been the subject of much debate, and the fact that, historically, English writers have translated the term as "[[countertenor]]" is not particularly helpful, since the meaning of that latter term has also been the subject of considerable musicological controversy; both terms are ultimately derived from the Latin ''contratenor'' (see [[countertenor]]). It is now generally accepted that the ''hautes-contre'' sang in what voice scientists term "modal" (i.e. "speaking" voice), perhaps using falsetto for their highest notes. A typical solo range for this voice was C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, considering that French eighteenth-century [[pitch (music)|pitch]] was as much as a whole tone lower than that of today.&lt;ref name="Sawkins" /&gt; Though this high-pitched range might lead one to think of the ''haute-contre'' as a light voice, historical evidence does not bear this out: Jélyotte was much praised for the strength of his high register,&lt;ref&gt;Cyr, ''op. cit.'', p 292&lt;/ref&gt; the astronomer and traveller [[Jérôme Lalande|Joseph Jérôme Lefrançois de Lalande]] commenting that "one takes more pleasure in hearing a large voice than a small one". Lalande stated that Jélyotte's range was identical to that of the famous tenor [[Angelo Amorevoli]]; he also remarked that "all those who succeeded Legros had to shout to arrive at the tones of an haute-contre, except for [[J. Rousseau|Rousseau]]: but he had the smallest sound".&lt;ref&gt;so quoted by Mary Cir (''ibidem'') from de Lalande’s ''Voyage en Italie'' (2/1786), p. 204-5. The date Cyr traces de Lalande’s statements back to, 1768, is evidently a misprint, as it widely precedes the facts reported: J. Rousseau was then only seven years old and Legros had just started his career and was very far from retiring. The alleged publication date of de Lalande’s ''Voyage en Italie'', or, rather, of its (second) edition whence the quotation is reported to have been drawn, 1786, is likelier to be the right one&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''haute-contre'' is regarded by some authorities as similar to, or indeed identical with, the voice-type described in Italian as ''[[tenore contraltino]]''. Although not unknown at an earlier date (for example the title-role in [[Mozart]]'s ''Mitridate''), roles for this voice were particularly numerous at the beginning of the nineteenth century: for example Lindoro in [[Rossini]]'s ''[[L'italiana in Algeri]]'' or Rodrigo in [[Otello (Rossini)|''Otello'']]. Rossini also wrote roles in French for this type of voice, which may thus be regarded as a direct continuation of the earlier ''haute-contre'' tradition. These include the protagonist of ''[[Le Comte Ory]]'', Néocles in ''[[Le siège de Corinthe]]'' and Arnold in ''[[William Tell (Rossini)|''Guillaume Tell'']]'', all of which were written for the great French tenor [[Adolphe Nourrit]].

==Modern performances==
Recently, with a revival of interest in and the performance of French baroque repertoire, several high tenors have come to prominence in ''haute-contre'' repertoire. These include [[Mark Padmore]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2002/10/10/bmpad10.xml The Great Communicator - article in Telegraph.co.uk 10 October 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;Anders J. Dahlin, Rogers Covey-Crump, [[Jean-Paul Fouchécourt]], [[Paul Agnew]] and [[Cyril Auvity]]. None of these sing the French Baroque repertoire to the exclusion of all others, and all are involved, to a greater or lesser extent, in the performance of mainstream tenor repertoire.

'''José Martiniano de Alencar''' (May 1, 1829 – December 12, 1877) was a Brazilian [[lawyer]], [[politician]], [[orator]], [[novelist]] and [[dramatist]]. He is considered to be one of the most famous and influential Brazilian [[Romanticism|Romantic]] novelists of the 19th century, and a major exponent of the literary tradition known as "[[Indianism (arts)|Indianism]]". Sometimes he signed his works with the [[pen name]] '''Erasmo'''.

He was patron of the 23rd chair of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]].

==Biography==
[[Image:Casa José de Alencar (by Tom Junior).jpg|thumb|left|The house where José de Alencar was born and lived in until 1844, in the Messejana neighborhood, in [[Fortaleza]]]]

José Martiniano de Alencar was born in [[Messejana, Fortaleza|Messejana]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Ceará]], on May 1, 1829, to politician [[José Martiniano Pereira de Alencar]] and his cousin Ana Josefina de Alencar.  His family was a rich and influential clan in Northeastern Brazil, his grandmother being famous landowner [[Barbara Pereira de Alencar]], heroine of the Pernambucan Revolution. Moving to [[São Paulo]] in 1844, he graduated in [[Law]] at the [[Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de São Paulo]] in 1850 and started his career in law in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Invited by his friend [[Francisco Otaviano]], he became a collaborator for the journal ''Correio Mercantil''. He also wrote many [[chronicle]]s for the ''Diário do Rio de Janeiro'' and the ''Jornal do Commercio''. Alencar would compile all the chronicles he wrote for these newspapers in 1874, under the name ''Ao Correr da Pena''.

It was in the ''Diário do Rio de Janeiro'', during the year of 1856, that Alencar gained notoriety, writing the ''Cartas sobre A Confederação dos Tamoios'', under the pseudonym '''Ig'''. In them, he bitterly criticized the [[A Confederação dos Tamoios|homonymous poem]] by [[Gonçalves de Magalhães, Viscount of Araguaia|Gonçalves de Magalhães]]. Even the Brazilian Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], who esteemed Magalhães very much, participated in this polemic, albeit under a pseudonym. Also in 1856, he wrote and published under ''[[feuilleton]]'' form his first romance, ''[[Five Minutes (novel)|Cinco Minutos]]'', that received critical acclaim. In the following year, his breakthrough novel, ''[[The Guarani|O Guarani]]'', was released; it would be adapted into [[Il Guarany|a famous opera]] by Brazilian composer [[Antônio Carlos Gomes]] 13 years later. ''O Guarani'' would be first novel of what is informally called Alencar's "[[Indianism (arts)|Indianist]] Trilogy" – a series of three novels by Alencar that focused on the foundations of the Brazilian nation, and on its indigenous peoples and culture. The other two novels, ''[[Iracema]]'' and ''[[Ubirajara (novel)|Ubirajara]]'', would be published on 1865 and 1874, respectively. Although called a trilogy, the three books are unrelated in its plots.

Alencar was affiliated with the [[Conservative Party (Brazil)|Conservative Party of Brazil]], being elected as a general deputy for Ceará. He was the Brazilian Minister of Justice from 1868 to 1870, having famously opposed the abolition of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hedra.com.br/livros/cartas-a-favor-da-escravidao&lt;/ref&gt; He also planned to be a senator, but Pedro II never appointed him, under the pretext of Alencar being too young;&lt;ref&gt;RODRIGUES, Antonio Edmilson Martins; FALCON, Francisco José Calazans. ''José de Alencar: O Poeta Armado do Século XIX''. [S.l.]: FGV Editora, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; with his feelings hurt, he would abandon politics later.

He was very close friends with the also famous writer [[Machado de Assis]], who wrote an article in 1866 praising his novel ''[[Iracema]]'', that was published the year before, comparing his Indianist works to [[Gonçalves Dias]], saying that "Alencar was in prose what Dias was in poetry". When Assis founded the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]] in 1897, he chose Alencar as the patron of his chair.

In 1864 he married Georgina Augusta Cochrane, daughter of an eccentric British aristocrat. They would have six children – [[Augusto de Alencar|Augusto]] (who would be the Brazilian [[Ministry of External Relations (Brazil)|Minister of External Relations]] in 1919, and also the Brazilian ambassador on the United States from 1920 to 1924), Clarisse, Ceci, Elisa, [[Mário de Alencar|Mário]] (who would be a journalist and writer, and a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters) and Adélia. (It is implied that Mário de Alencar was actually an illegitimate son of Machado de Assis, a fact that inspired Assis to write his famous novel ''[[Dom Casmurro]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://veja.abril.com.br/110899/p_138.html Mário de Alencar: Machado de Assis' son?] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Alencar died in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1877, a victim of [[tuberculosis]]. A theatre in Fortaleza, the [[Theatro José de Alencar]], was named after him.

'''Latin syntax''' is the part of [[Latin]] grammar that covers such matters as word order, the use of cases, tenses and [[grammatical mood|moods]], and the construction of simple and compound sentences.

The study of Latin syntax in a systematic way was particularly a feature of the late 19th century, especially in Germany. For example, in the 3rd edition of ''[[Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve|Gildersleeve]]'s Latin Grammar'' (1895), the reviser, Gonzalez Lodge, mentions 38 scholars whose works have been used in its revision; of these 31 wrote in German, five in English and two in French. (The English scholars include [[Henry John Roby|Roby]] and [[Wallace Lindsay|Lindsay]]).

In the twentieth century, the German tradition was continued with the publication of two very comprehensive grammars: the ''Ausführliche Grammatik der lateinischen Sprache'' by Raphael Kühner and Karl Stegmann (1912, first edition 1879), and the ''Lateinische Grammatik'' by Manu Leumann, J.B. Hofmann, and Anton Szantyr (revised edition Munich 1977, first edition 1926). Among works published in English may be mentioned E.C. Woodcock's ''A New Latin Syntax'' (1959). More recently, taking advantage of computerised texts, three major works have been published on Latin word order, one by the American scholars Andrew Devine and Laurence Stephens (2006),&lt;ref&gt;Devine &amp; Stephens (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and two (adopting a different approach) by the Czech scholar Olga Spevak (2010 and 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Spevak (2010); Spevak (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin word order==
{{main|Latin word order}}
Latin word order is relatively free. The verb may be found at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of a sentence; an adjective may precede or follow its noun (''vir bonus'' or ''bonus vir'' both mean 'a good man');&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; and a genitive may precede or follow its noun ('the enemies' camp' can be both ''hostium castra'' and ''castra hostium''; the latter is more common).&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also stylistic differences between Latin authors; for example, while [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] always writes ''castra pōnit'' 'he sets up camp', [[Livy]] more often writes ''pōnit castra''.&lt;ref&gt;Devine &amp; Stephens (2006), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are however certain constraints; for example, in prose a monosyllabic preposition such as ''in'' 'in' generally precedes its noun (e.g. ''in Italiā'' 'in Italy').&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, even though adjectives can both precede and follow the noun, there is a tendency for different kinds of adjectives to take different positions; for example adjectives of size usually come before the noun&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1918), p. 648.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Rose (1924)&lt;/ref&gt; (''magnā vōce'' 'in a loud voice', rarely ''vōce magnā''), while 'modifiers that are more important than their noun or that specify it'&lt;ref&gt;Spevak (2014), pp. 212ff.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. ''Via Appia'' 'the Appian Way') usually follow it.

To explain Latin word order there are two main schools of thought. One, represented by Devine and Stephens (2006), argues from the point of view of [[generative grammar]], and maintains that Latin prose has a basic underlying "neutral" word order, from which authors deviate for reasons of emphasis, topicalisation, rhythm, and so on. According to Devine and Stephens, the basic order in broad scope focus sentences is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Devine &amp; Stephens (2006), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Subject – Direct Object – Indirect Object / Oblique Argument – Adjunct – Goal or Source Argument – Non-Referential Direct Object – Verb

The other approach, represented by Panhuis (1982) and Olga Spevak (2010), examines Latin word order from the point of view of [[Functional theories of grammar|functional grammar]]. Rejecting the idea that there is a basic word order, this approach seeks to explain word order in terms of pragmatic factors, such as topic and focus, and semantic ones (1st person before 2nd, human before animals or things, agent before patient, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Spevak (2010), pp. 2ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of word order===
{{see|Hyperbaton}}

The order of words is often chosen according to the emphasis required by the author. One way of emphasising a word is to reverse the usual order.&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the opening sentence of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s ''Gallic War'', the usual order&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1918), p. 648.&lt;/ref&gt; of numeral and noun ''trīs partīs'' 'three parts' is reversed to emphasise the number 'three':
*''Gallia est omnis dīvīsa in partīs &lt;u&gt;trīs&lt;/u&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 1.1.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:'Gaul, considered as a whole, is divided into &lt;u&gt;three&lt;/u&gt; (parts)'

Another technique used by Latin authors is to separate a phrase and put another word or phrase in the middle, for example:
*''&lt;u&gt;magnam&lt;/u&gt; enim sēcum &lt;u&gt;pecūniam&lt;/u&gt; portābat''&lt;ref&gt;Nepos, ''Hannibal'', 9.2.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:'for he was carrying with him a &lt;u&gt;large sum of money&lt;/u&gt;'

The technical term for this kind of separation is "[[hyperbaton]]" (Greek for 'stepping over'); it is described by Devine and Stephens as 'perhaps the most distinctively alien feature of Latin word order'.&lt;ref&gt;Divine &amp; Stephens (2006), p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt;

Placing the verb at or near the beginning of a clause sometimes indicates that the action is sudden or unexpected:&lt;ref&gt;Divine &amp; Stephens (2006), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''statim complūrēs cum tēlīs in hunc &lt;u&gt;faciunt&lt;/u&gt; dē locō superiōre &lt;u&gt;impetum&lt;/u&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Mil.'' 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'immediately several men, (armed) with weapons, &lt;u&gt;launch an attack&lt;/u&gt; on my client from higher ground'

Splitting up an adjective-noun phrase and bringing the adjective to the beginning of the sentence can highlight it. In the following example from Cicero, the splitting of ''cruentum'' 'blood-stained' and ''pugiōnem'' 'dagger' creates a dramatic effect:&lt;ref&gt;Divine &amp; Stephens (2006), p. 545.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''statim &lt;u&gt;cruentum&lt;/u&gt; altē tollēns Brūtus &lt;u&gt;pugiōnem&lt;/u&gt; Cicerōnem nōminātim exclāmāvit''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Phil.'' 2.28.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'immediately, raising high the &lt;u&gt;blood-stained dagger&lt;/u&gt;, Brutus shouted out "Cicero" by name'

Considerations of rhythm and elegance also play a part in Latin word order.&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 429; Walker (1918), p. 652.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Pliny the Younger]] begins a letter as follows:
*''magnum prōventum poētārum annus hic attulit''&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Ep.'' 1.13.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:'it is a great crop of poets this year has brought'

In this sentence, the object (''magnum prōventum poētārum'' 'a great crop of poets') has been brought forward to highlight it. The other striking feature is the order ''annus hic'' for the more usual ''hic annus'' 'this year'. Two reasons which might be suggested are Pliny's fondness for ending a sentence with the rhythm − u − − u − &lt;ref&gt;"a clausula of cretic plus cretic, a favorite with Pliny": Selatie E. Stout, ''Scribe and Critic at Work in Pliny's Letters'' (1954), p. 150. (The symbol – stands for a long syllable, and u for a short one.)&lt;/ref&gt; and also no doubt because of the elegant assonance of the vowels ''a-u-i a-u-i'' in the last three words.

==Gender and number==
===Gender and number agreement===
Latin has three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and two numbers (singular and plural). Pronouns, adjectives, participles, and the numbers one to three have to agree in gender and number with the noun they refer to:

*Masculine : ''&lt;u&gt;hic&lt;/u&gt; est fīlius &lt;u&gt;meus&lt;/u&gt;'':&lt;ref&gt;Matt. 17.5&lt;/ref&gt; 'this is my son'
*Feminine : ''&lt;u&gt;haec&lt;/u&gt; est fīlia &lt;u&gt;mea&lt;/u&gt;'' : 'this is my daughter'
*Neuter : ''&lt;u&gt;hoc&lt;/u&gt; est corpus &lt;u&gt;meum&lt;/u&gt;'':&lt;ref&gt;Matt. 26.26&lt;/ref&gt; 'this is my body'

The same three genders are also found in the plural:

*Masculine : ''&lt;u&gt;hī&lt;/u&gt; sunt fīliī &lt;u&gt;meī&lt;/u&gt;'' : 'these are my sons'
*Feminine : ''&lt;u&gt;hae&lt;/u&gt; sunt fīliae &lt;u&gt;meae&lt;/u&gt;'' : 'these are my daughters'
*Neuter : ''&lt;u&gt;haec&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;mea&lt;/u&gt; sunt'':&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Ec.'' 9.1&lt;/ref&gt; 'these things are mine'

In Latin, words referring to males are always masculine, words referring to females are usually feminine.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1930) [1871], pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; (An exception is ''scortum'' (neuter) 'a whore'.) Words referring to things can be any of the three genders, for example ''mōns'' 'mountain' (masculine), ''arbor'' 'tree' (feminine), ''nōmen'' 'name' (neuter). However, there are certain rules; for example, nouns with the suffixes ''-a'' (unless referring to men), ''-tiō'', ''-tās'' are feminine; the names of trees, islands, and countries, such as ''pīnus'' 'pine', ''Cyprus'' 'Cyprus', and ''Aegyptus'' 'Egypt' are also usually feminine, and so on. Some nouns such as ''parēns'' 'parent' can vary between masculine and feminine and are called of "common" gender.&lt;ref&gt;The appendix of Kennedy's ''Revised Latin Primer'', pp. 221-225, has a series of rhymes to assist in learning the rules for gender.&lt;/ref&gt;

When words of different genders are combined, the adjective is usually masculine if referring to people, neuter if referring to things:&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''patēr mihī et mātēr &lt;u&gt;mortuī&lt;/u&gt; (sunt)'' (Terence)&lt;ref&gt;Terence, ''Eun.'' 518&lt;/ref&gt;
:'my father and mother are dead (''masc.'')'
*''mūrus et porta dē caelō &lt;u&gt;tācta&lt;/u&gt; erant'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 32.29.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:'the wall (''masc.'') and gate (''fem.'') had been struck (''neut. pl.'') by lightning' (lit. 'touched from the sky')

However, sometimes the adjective may agree with the nearest noun.

==Latin cases==
{{further information|Latin declension}}
Nouns, pronouns, and adjectives in Latin change their endings according to their function in the sentence. The different endings are called different 'cases'. Case endings of a similar kind are also found in other languages, such as Ancient and Modern Greek, German, Russian, Finnish, Sanskrit, Armenian and Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Barry (1994). ''Case''. Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The six cases most commonly used in Latin and their main meanings are given below. The cases are presented here in the order which has been used in Britain and countries influenced by Britain ever since the publication of [[Benjamin Hall Kennedy|Kennedy]]'s Latin Primer in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Stray (1996), ''Grinders and Grammars: A Victorian Controversy'' (The Textbook Colloquium).&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the traditional order – Nom, Gen, Dat, Acc, Voc, Abl – still used in the United States and most European countries:

*Nominative : ''is rēx'' : 'that king' (Subject, or Complement (e.g. 'he is that king'))
*Vocative : ''ō rēx!'' : 'o king!'
*Accusative : ''eum rēgem'' : 'that king' (Object, or Goal)
*Genitive : ''eius rēgis'' : 'of that king'
*Dative : ''eī rēgī'' : 'to that king', 'for that king'
*Ablative : ''eō rēge'' : 'with that king' (also 'by, from, in')

(A small line, called a macron, over a vowel indicates that it is pronounced long.)

Another case is the Locative, which is used mostly with the names of cities (e.g. ''Rōmae'' 'in Rome') and a very limited number of ordinary nouns (e.g. ''domī'' 'at home').

===Examples of case use===
{{further information|Ablative (Latin)}}

For the most part the use of cases is quite straightforward. The following examples from [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] show the cases in use in a basic sense:
*''Cūriō &lt;u&gt;Mārcium&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;Uticam&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;nāvibus&lt;/u&gt; praemittit''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''Bell. Civ.'' 2.24.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'Curio (Nom.) sends ahead Marcius (Acc.) to Utica (Acc.) with the ships (Abl.)'

Here ''Cūriō'' as subject of the verb is nominative, ''Mārcium'' as direct object is accusative; ''Uticam'' is also accusative as it is the goal or object of motion; and ''nāvibus'' 'with the ships' has the ablative ending, which means 'with'.

*''Pompeius ... &lt;u&gt;Lūceriā&lt;/u&gt; proficīscitur &lt;u&gt;Canusium&lt;/u&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''Bell. Civ.'' 1.24.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:'Pompey (Nom) &lt;u&gt;from Luceria&lt;/u&gt; (Abl) sets out &lt;u&gt;to Canusium&lt;/u&gt; (Acc)'

Here ''Pompeius'' is subject (Nom.), ''Lūceriā'' shows another meaning of the ablative ending, namely 'from', and ''Canusium'' is again accusative of goal. Note that with names of cities there is no need to add a preposition such as ''ad'', but the accusative case alone indicates 'to'.

*''Caesar ... &lt;u&gt;mīlitibus&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;signum&lt;/u&gt; dedit''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''Bell. Gall.'' 7.27.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'Caesar (Nom) gave a signal (Acc.) &lt;u&gt;to the soldiers&lt;/u&gt; (Dat)'

Here ''mīlitibus'', although it shares the same ending as the ablative ''nāvibus'' in the previous example, is clearly dative, meaning 'to or for the soldiers' (usually when a noun has an ambiguous ending such as ''-īs'', ''-ibus'' or ''-ēbus'' it will be interpreted as dative if it is a person, ablative if it is a thing).

===Idioms using the dative case===
However, the description of the use of cases is not always simple. The classification of the uses of the dative alone takes up nearly twelve pages in Woodcock's ''A New Latin Syntax''&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), pp. 38-50.&lt;/ref&gt; and ten pages in Gildersleeve and Lodge.&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), pp. 218-230.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when asking someone's name, a Roman would say:
*''quid est &lt;u&gt;tibī&lt;/u&gt; nōmen?'' ([[Plautus]])&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Pseud.'' 634 and 639; ''Pre.'' 697; ''Trin.'' 886.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'what's your name?' (lit. 'what is &lt;u&gt;for you&lt;/u&gt; name?'')

This is an example of the Dative of Possession, as in:
*''&lt;u&gt;illī&lt;/u&gt; ... duae fuēre fīliae'' (Plautus)&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Poen.'' 84&lt;/ref&gt;
:'he had two daughters' (lit. '&lt;u&gt;to him&lt;/u&gt; there were two daughters')

Another surprising idiomatic use is the "Dative of the Person Affected":
*''nihil equidem &lt;u&gt;tibī&lt;/u&gt; abstulī'' (Plautus)&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Aul.'' 635; cf. Gildersleeve and Lodge (1895), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'I haven't stolen anything from you' (lit. '&lt;u&gt;for you&lt;/u&gt;')

The dative is also used with verbs of fighting with someone:&lt;ref&gt;Kühner &amp; Stegmann (1912), p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nōlī pugnāre &lt;u&gt;duōbus&lt;/u&gt;'' (Catullus)&lt;ref&gt;Catullus 62.64&lt;/ref&gt;
:'don't fight with (lit. 'for') two people at once'

Another idiom is the "Predicative Dative" used with the verb 'to be' in phrases such as ''ūsuī esse'' 'to be of use', ''labōrī esse'' 'to be a trouble (to someone)'.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), pp. 48-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nēminī meus adventus &lt;u&gt;labōrī&lt;/u&gt; aut &lt;u&gt;sūmptuī&lt;/u&gt; ... fuit'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, Ver. 2.1.16; cf. Woodcock (1959), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:'my arrival was a &lt;u&gt;trouble&lt;/u&gt; or &lt;u&gt;expense&lt;/u&gt; for no one'

Many verbs also which in English take a direct object are used in Latin intransitively with a dative noun or pronoun, e.g. ''persuādeō'' 'I persuade', ''crēdō'' 'I believe', ''resistō'' 'I resist'.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), pp. 41-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nōn persuāsit &lt;u&gt;illī&lt;/u&gt;'' (Seneca)&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Ep.'' 70.10&lt;/ref&gt;
:'he did not persuade him (lit. 'for him')'
*''imperāvit &lt;u&gt;eī&lt;/u&gt;'' (Nepos)&lt;ref&gt;Nepos, ''Hann.'' 12&lt;/ref&gt;
:'he ordered him' ('gave an order to him')

===Prepositions===
Frequently, to make the meaning more precise, a noun in the accusative or ablative is preceded by a preposition such as ''in''  'in, into', ''ad'' 'to', ''cum'' 'with', or ''ex'' 'out of'. This is especially so if the noun refers to a person. For example: 
*''ad rēgem'' (Acc) 'to the king' (used with a verb of motion such as 'goes' or 'sends') 
*''ā rēge'' (Abl.) 'by the king', 'from the king'
*''cum eō'' (Abl.) 'with him'
*''ex urbe'' (Abl.) 'from/out of the city'

However, when the meaning of an accusative or an ablative is clear (for example ''Canusium'' (Acc) 'to Canusium', ''nāvibus'' (Abl) 'with the ships', ''posterō diē'' (Abl) 'on the following day'), the case ending alone is sufficient to give the meaning. Unlike in Greek, prepositions are not used in Latin with the dative or genitive.

====Prepositions with accusative or ablative====
Four prepositions can be followed by more than one case, depending on their meaning. These are ''in''  'in' (Abl), 'into' (Acc.); ''sub'' 'under' (Abl.), 'to the foot of' (Acc.); ''super'' 'over, above' (Acc.), 'concerning' (Abl.); and ''subter'' 'under' (usually with Acc.)&lt;ref&gt;Greenough et al. (1903), pp. 131-136.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''in urbem'' (Acc) 'into the city' 
*''in urbe'' (Abl) 'in the city' 

====Position of prepositions====
Prepositions almost always precede their noun or pronoun, except that ''cum'' 'with' follows a personal pronoun, e.g. ''mēcum'' 'with me' and sometimes a relative pronoun (''quīcum'', ''quōcum'' and ''cum quō'' are all possible for 'with whom').&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; There are occasional exceptions, especially with two-syllable prepositions after pronouns,&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. ''haec inter'' (Virgil)&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aen.'' 8.671.&lt;/ref&gt; 'in the midst of these'. 

Sometimes when the noun has an adjective it is placed before the preposition for emphasis, e.g. ''magnā cum cūrā'' 'with great care' (Cicero),&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Inv.'' 1.50&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not an invariable rule.&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1918), p. 651-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally also the opposite order (noun-preposition-adjective) may be used in poetry and later prose,&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 267, note 1&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. ''silvā lupus in Sabīnā'' (Horace)&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Car.'' 1.22.9&lt;/ref&gt; 'a wolf in the Sabine forest', or ''metū in magnō'' (Livy) 'in great fear'.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 9.37.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin tenses==
{{further information|Latin conjugation}}
Latin has six main tenses in the indicative mood, which are illustrated below using the verb ''facere'' 'to make' or 'to do':
*Present : ''faciō'' : 'I do', 'I am doing'
*Future : ''faciam''  (2nd person ''faciēs''): 'I will do', 'I will be doing'
*Imperfect : ''faciēbam'' : 'I was doing', 'I used to do', 'I began to do'
*Perfect : ''fēcī'' : 'I did', 'I have done'
*Future Perfect : ''fēcerō'' : 'I will have done'
*Pluperfect : ''fēceram'' : 'I had done'

The verb ''sum'' 'I am', which is irregular, has the tenses ''sum'', ''erō'', ''eram'', ''fuī'', ''fuerō'', ''fueram''. Some verbs (conjugations 1 and 2) instead of the Future ''-am'', ''-ēs'', ''-et'' etc. have a different future ending in ''-bō'', ''-bis'', ''-bit'', e.g. ''amābō'' 'I will love'.

To these six ordinary tenses may be added various "periphrastic" tenses, made from a participle and part of the verb ''sum'' 'I am', such as ''factūrus eram'' 'I was about to do'.&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the most part these tenses are used in a fairly straightforward way; however, there are certain idiomatic uses that may be noted.&lt;ref&gt;See Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), pp. 154-167.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of the tenses===
====Present====
The present tense can refer to a current situation:
*''Senātus haec intellegit; Cōnsul videt; hic tamen vīvit'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;CIcero, ''in Cat.'' 1.2.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'the Senate understands this; the Consul sees it; yet this man is still alive'
*'''tū fortasse vērum dīcis'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''Academica Pos.'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'perhaps you are telling the truth'

It can also refer to an event which takes place at the moment of speaking:
*''veniō nunc ad Dorylēnsium testimōnium'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''pro Flacco'' 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'I come now to the testimony of the Dorylensians'

The present tense is often used in narrative in a past sense, especially when the writer is describing an exciting moment in the story. This is known as the 'historic present':
*''videt imminēre hostēs ... capit arma a proximīs ...''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, B.C. 6.38.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'he sees the enemy threatening ... he immediately seizes weapons from those next to him ...'

After ''dum'' 'while', the present has an imperfect meaning:
*''dumque &lt;u&gt;fugit&lt;/u&gt;, tergō vēlāmina lāpsa relīquit'' (Ovid)&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Met'' 4.55&lt;/ref&gt;
:'while she was fleeing, her cloak (''vēlāmina'') slipped from her back (''tergō'') and she left it behind'

The present can sometimes mean 'has been doing', usually with a length of time and ''iam'' 'now':&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), pp. 157, 159.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''is Lilybaeī multōs iam annõs &lt;u&gt;habitat&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Verr.'' 2.4.38.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'he has been living in Lilybaeum for many years now'

====Future====
The future tense can describe an event or a situation in the near or distant future:
*''ibī cōtīdiē tuās litterās exspectābō'' (Cicero)
:'when I get there, I shall be expecting your letters every day'
*''īnsequentī librō explicābō'' (Vitruvius)
:'I will explain this in the next book'

After ''cum'' 'when' or ''sī'' 'if' referring to a future time, usually&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), pp. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; the future is used where English has a present tense:
*''nārrābō cum aliquid &lt;u&gt;habēbō&lt;/u&gt; novī'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''ad Att.'' 5.6.2.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'I will tell you when I have some news' (lit. 'I will have')

====Imperfect====
The imperfect tense can describe a situation that used to take place regularly or habitually:
*''multum enim illum &lt;u&gt;audiēbam&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)
:'I used to listen to him a lot'

It can also describe a situation that was temporarily taking place at a particular moment:
*''senex dīcitur eam fābulam, quam in manibus &lt;u&gt;habēbat&lt;/u&gt;, recitāsse iūdicibus'' (Cicero)
:'the old man is said to have recited the play, which he was holding (at that moment) in his hands, to the judges'

Another use is to describe what someone was trying to do, or intending to do, or about to do, but which never actually took place:&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), pp. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Cūriam relinquēbat'' (Tacitus)&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Ann.'' 2.34&lt;/ref&gt;
:'he was on the point of leaving the Senate house'

When used with ''iam'' and a length of time it means 'had been doing':
*''quod iam diū &lt;u&gt;cupiēbant&lt;/u&gt;'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 24.29&lt;/ref&gt;
:'which they had been desiring for a long time now'

Sometimes in letters a writer imagines himself in the position of the recipient and uses a past tense to describe an event which for the writer himself is present:&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), pp. 166-7.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''etenim ibī sedēns haec ad te &lt;u&gt;scrībēbam&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Att.'' 1.10 (6)&lt;/ref&gt;
:'as a matter of fact I was sitting there as &lt;u&gt;I was writing&lt;/u&gt; this to you' (i.e. 'I am sitting there as I write this to you')

====Perfect====
The perfect most frequently narrates an event in the past:
*''ūniversī ex nāvī &lt;u&gt;dēsiluērunt&lt;/u&gt;'' (Caesar)
:'all at the same time, &lt;u&gt;they leapt down&lt;/u&gt; from the ship'

The perfect can also be used like the English present perfect ('I have done'):&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ecum et mūlum Brundisī tibī &lt;u&gt;relīquī&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Fam'', 16.9.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'&lt;u&gt;I have left&lt;/u&gt; a horse and a mule for you at Brundisium'

The three verbs ''ōdī'' 'I hate', ''meminī'' 'I remember', and ''nōvī'' 'I know', are used in the perfect tense but have the meaning of a present tense:
*''&lt;u&gt;meminī&lt;/u&gt; mē adesse'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Fin.'' 2.55&lt;/ref&gt;
:'&lt;u&gt;I remember&lt;/u&gt; that I was present'
*''&lt;u&gt;ōdī&lt;/u&gt; et amō'' (Catullus)
:'&lt;u&gt;I hate&lt;/u&gt; and I love'

The perfect, not the imperfect, is used when a situation is said to have lasted in the past for a certain length of time, unless ''iam'' 'now' is added:&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''diū ... silentium &lt;u&gt;fuit&lt;/u&gt;'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy 7.10.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:'for a long time &lt;u&gt;there was&lt;/u&gt; silence'
*''multōs annōs nostrae domī &lt;u&gt;vīxit&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusc''. 5.113&lt;/ref&gt;
:'&lt;u&gt;he lived&lt;/u&gt; in our house for many years'

The perfect ''fuit'' 'it was once', 'it used to be' is also used for a situation which is no longer in existence:
*''statua Attī ... ad laevam cūriae &lt;u&gt;fuit&lt;/u&gt;'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 1.36.5&lt;/ref&gt; 
:'there was once a statue of [[Attus Navius|Attus]] to the left of the senate house'

The perfect is also necessary in sentences such as the following, which describe a permanent state, as opposed to the imperfect, which describes a temporary one:&lt;ref&gt;Pinkster (1990), p. 238, §11.3.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Samia mihī māter &lt;u&gt;fuit&lt;/u&gt;; ea habitābat Rhodī.''&lt;ref&gt;Terence, ''Eun.'' 107&lt;/ref&gt;
:"My mother &lt;u&gt;was&lt;/u&gt; a Samian; &lt;u&gt;she was living&lt;/u&gt; in Rhodes (at that time)."

The perfect must also be used with adverbs such as ''semel'' 'once', ''bis'' 'twice', ''ter'' 'three times', which imply that the situation is now over:&lt;ref&gt;Pinkster (1990), p. 223, §11.1.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''&lt;u&gt;fuī&lt;/u&gt; bis in Bīthȳniā'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Planc.'' 84.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'&lt;u&gt;I have been&lt;/u&gt; twice in Bithynia'

====Future perfect====
The future perfect is usually used in a sentence with 'if' or 'when', but it can sometimes be used on its own, as in the following sentence:
*''Pompōnia, tū invīta mulierēs, egō virōs accīverō'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''ad Att.'' 5.1.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'Pomponia, you invite the women, and (meanwhile) I will have summoned the men'

There is also an idiom using the future perfect of ''videō'':&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''vōs &lt;u&gt;vīderītis&lt;/u&gt; quod illī dēbeātur'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 1.58.10.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'you must see to it what is due to that man'

More frequently it is found after ''sī'' 'if' or ''cum'' 'when'. The future perfect is used when the event in the 'if' clause will precede the main verb:&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), pp. 373; 380-381&lt;/ref&gt;
*''moriēre, sī &lt;u&gt;ēmīserīs&lt;/u&gt; vōcem!'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy 1.58.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'you will die, if you utter a sound!' (lit. 'if you will have uttered')

====Pluperfect====
The pluperfect can be used as in English to describe an event that had happened earlier than the time of the narrative:
*''quae gēns paucīs ante mēnsibus ad Caesarem lēgātōs mīserat'' (Caesar)&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C.'' 3.80.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'this nation had sent ambassadors to Caesar a few months previously'

The pluperfect of ''ōdī'', ''nōvī'' and ''meminī'' has the meaning of an imperfect:
*''nōn &lt;u&gt;nōverat&lt;/u&gt; Catilīnam; Āfricam tum praetor ille obtinēbat'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Cael.'' 10&lt;/ref&gt;
:'he did not know [[Catiline]], since the latter was at that time governor of Africa'

==Passive and deponent verbs==
===Passive tenses===
In addition to the [[active voice]] tenses listed above, Latin has a set of passive voice tenses as follows:
*Present : ''capior'' : 'I am captured', 'I am being captured' (by someone or something)
*Future : ''capiar'' (2nd singular ''capiēre'' or ''capiēris'') : 'I will be captured'
*Imperfect : ''capiēbar'' : 'I was being captured', 'I used to be captured'
*Perfect : ''captus sum'' : 'I was captured', 'I have been captured'
*Future Perfect : ''captus erō'' : 'I will have been captured'
*Pluperfect : ''captus eram'' : 'I had been captured'

The three perfect tenses (Perfect, Future Perfect, and Pluperfect) are formed using the perfect participle together with part of the verb ''sum'' 'I am'. The ending of the participle changes according to the gender and number of the subject: ''captus est'' 'he was captured'; ''capta est'' 'she was captured'; ''captī sunt'' 'they were captured', and so on.

===The use of passive verbs===
A passive verb is generally used when it is unnecessary to indicate who did the action:
*''[ille] sē hostibus obtulit atque &lt;u&gt;interfectus est&lt;/u&gt;.''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, B.G. 4.12.6&lt;/ref&gt;
:'he offered himself to the enemy and was killed'

When it is desired to show the agent or person(s) by whom the action was done, Latin uses the preposition ''ab'' or ''ā'' with the ablative case:
*''arx &lt;u&gt;ab hostibus&lt;/u&gt; capta est'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 9.24&lt;/ref&gt;
:'the citadel has been captured by the enemy!'

When the agent is not a person but a thing, no preposition is used, but simply the ablative case:
*''Trōes tē miserī, &lt;u&gt;ventīs&lt;/u&gt; maria omnia vectī, ōrāmus'' (Virgil)&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aeneid'' 1.520.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'we, wretched Trojans, carried over all the seas by the winds, beg you'

===Passive of 'give'===
In Latin, unlike English, only the direct object (not the indirect object) of an active verb can be made the subject of a passive verb.&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not correct to say in Latin 'the soldiers were being given their pay' but only 'pay was being given to the soldiers':
*''mīlitibus stīpendium (dabātur)'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 1.12&lt;/ref&gt;
:'pay was being given to the soldiers'

===Impersonal passive===
Another unusual feature of Latin, compared with English, is that intransitive verbs such as ''eō'' 'I go', ''veniō'' 'I come', ''pugnō'' 'I fight' and ''persuādeō'' (+ dative) 'I persuade' can be made passive, but only in a 3rd person singular impersonal form:&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''&lt;u&gt;ītur&lt;/u&gt; in antīquam silvam'' (Virgil)&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aen.'' 6.179&lt;/ref&gt;
:'they go into an ancient forest' (lit. 'going is done') 
*''septimō diē Carthāginem &lt;u&gt;ventum est&lt;/u&gt;'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 26.42&lt;/ref&gt;
:'on the seventh day they reached Carthage'
*''&lt;u&gt;persuāsum erat&lt;/u&gt; Cluviō ut mentīrētur'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Q.Rosc.'' 51.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'Cluvius had been persuaded to lie' (literally: 'it had been persuaded to Cluvius that he should lie')

===Passive infinitive===
The infinitive of a passive verb ends in ''-ī'' (3rd conjugation) or ''-rī'' (other conjugations): ''capī'' 'to be captured, ''audīrī'' 'to be heard', etc.
*''in vincula &lt;u&gt;dūcī&lt;/u&gt; iubet'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 3.49.2.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'he ordered him to be put in chains'
*''sī vīs &lt;u&gt;amārī&lt;/u&gt;, amā'' (Seneca)&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Ep.'' 9.6.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'if you wish to be loved, love'

The Perfect passive has an infinitive ''captus esse'' 'to have been captured', and there is also a rarely used Future passive infinitive made using the supine (''captum'') plus the passive infinitive ''īrī'': ''captum īrī'' 'to be going to be captured'. It is typically used in indirect statements:
*''&lt;u&gt;occīsum īrī&lt;/u&gt; ab ipsō Milōne videō'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Att.'' 4.2.4.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'I can see that he is going to get killed by Milo himself'

===Deponent verbs===
Most of the verbs ending in ''-or'' are true passives in meaning (i.e. they represent actions which are done ''by someone'' or ''by something''). However, there are a few which are ambivalent and can be either active or passive in meaning, such as ''vertor'' 'I turn' (intransitive) or 'I am turned', ''volvor'' 'I revolve' (intransitive) or 'I am rolled': 
*''&lt;u&gt;vertitur&lt;/u&gt; intereā caelum et ruit Ōceanō nox'' (Virgil)&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aen.'' 2.250&lt;/ref&gt;
:'meanwhile the sky &lt;u&gt;turns&lt;/u&gt; and night falls upon the Ocean'

In addition, there are a few verbs such as ''proficīscor'' 'I set out', ''polliceor'' 'I promise', ''cōnor'' 'I try' which despite their passive endings have an active meaning. These verbs (which have no active counterpart) are called [[deponent verb]]s:&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), pp. 110-114.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ipse in Italiam &lt;u&gt;profectus est&lt;/u&gt;'' (Caesar)&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 3.35.2&lt;/ref&gt;
:'he himself &lt;u&gt;set out&lt;/u&gt; for Italy'

Although most deponent verbs are intransitive, some of them such as ''sequor'' 'I follow' can take a direct object:
*''hunc &lt;u&gt;sequī&lt;/u&gt; sē iubet'' (Nepos)&lt;ref&gt;Nepos, ''Alc.'' 10.5&lt;/ref&gt;
:'he ordered this man &lt;u&gt;to follow&lt;/u&gt; him'

Deponent verbs are frequently used in their perfect participle form (e.g. ''profectus'' 'having set out'):
*''mediā nocte &lt;u&gt;profectus&lt;/u&gt; ad hostium castra māne pervēnit''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, B.G. 7.18.2.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'after setting out at midnight, he reached the enemies' camp in the early morning'

==The subjunctive mood==
As well as the indicative mood illustrated above, which is used for stating and asking facts, and an imperative mood, used for direct commands, Latin has a [[subjunctive mood]], used to express nuances of meaning such as 'would', 'could', 'should', 'may' etc. (The word ''mood'' in a grammatical sense comes from the Latin ''modus'', and has no connection with the other meaning of 'mood', in the sense of 'emotional state', which comes from a Germanic root.)&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of the subjunctive===
There are four tenses of the subjunctive, which in the verb ''faciō'' are as follows:
*Present : ''faciam'' (2nd person ''faciās'') : 'I may do', 'I would do', 'I should do' (also simply 'I do')
*Imperfect : ''facerem'' : 'I would be doing', 'I should do' (in a past context) (also simply 'I was doing')
*Perfect : ''fēcerim'' : 'I have done', 'I did'
*Pluperfect : ''fēcissem'' : 'I would or should have done' (also 'I had done')

The present subjunctive of 1st conjugation verbs ends in ''-em'' instead of ''-am'': ''amem'' 'I may love, I would love'.

The present subjunctive of the verbs ''sum'' 'I am', ''possum'' 'I am able', ''volō'' 'I want', ''nōlō'' 'I don't want' and ''mālō'' 'I prefer', ends in ''-im'': ''sim'' 'I may be, I would be', ''possim'' 'I may be able', ''velim'' 'I would like, I may wish', etc.

The imperfect subjunctive of every verb has the same form as the infinitive + ''-m'': ''essem'', ''possem'', ''vellem'', ''amārem'', ''vidērem'', ''īrem'' etc.

===Uses of the subjunctive===
The subjunctive has numerous uses, ranging from what potentially might be true to what the speaker wishes or commands should happen. It is often translated with 'should', 'could', 'would', 'may' and so on, but in certain contexts, for example indirect questions or after the conjunction ''cum'' 'when' or 'since', it is translated as if it were an ordinary indicative verb.

Often in English the subjunctive can be translated by an infinitive; for example, ''imperāvit ut īret'' (literally, 'he ordered &lt;u&gt;that he should go&lt;/u&gt;') becomes in more idiomatic English 'he ordered him &lt;u&gt;to go&lt;/u&gt;'.

====Potential subjunctive====
The 'potential' subjunctive is used when the speaker imagines what potentially may, might, would, or could happen in the present or future or might have happened in the past. The negative of this kind is ''nōn'':&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''dūrum hoc fortasse &lt;u&gt;videātur&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Ver.'' 2.5.7.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'this &lt;u&gt;may&lt;/u&gt; perhaps &lt;u&gt;seem&lt;/u&gt; harsh'

*''quid si hoc &lt;u&gt;fēcissem&lt;/u&gt;?'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Inventione'' 2.140.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'what if I had done this?'

*''nōn facile &lt;u&gt;dīxerim&lt;/u&gt; quicquam mē vīdisse pulchrius''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Verr.'' 2.4.94.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'I couldn't easily say (= I don't think) that I have ever seen anything more beautiful'

====Optative subjunctive====
Another use is for what the speaker wishes may happen, or wishes had happened (the 'optative' subjunctive). The negative of this kind is ''nē'':&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''utinam iam &lt;u&gt;adesset&lt;/u&gt;!'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Fam.'' 11.25.2&lt;/ref&gt;
:'if only he were here already!'

*''utinam ille omnīs sēcum suās cōpiās &lt;u&gt;ēduxisset&lt;/u&gt;!'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''In Cat.'' 2.4.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'if only he had taken out all his forces with him!'

====Jussive subjunctive====
It can also represent what the speaker commands or suggests should happen (the 'jussive' subjunctive).&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; The negative is again ''nē'':
*''&lt;u&gt;vīvāmus&lt;/u&gt;, mea Lesbia, atque &lt;u&gt;amēmus&lt;/u&gt;'' (Catullus)&lt;ref&gt;Catullus, 5.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'&lt;u&gt;let's live&lt;/u&gt;, my Lesbia, and &lt;u&gt;let's love&lt;/u&gt;'

*''nē ... mortem &lt;u&gt;timuerītis&lt;/u&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusc.'' 1.98.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'you should not fear death'

===In indirect statements and questions===
One important use of the subjunctive mood in Latin is to indicate that the words are quoted; this applies for example to subordinate clauses in indirect speech:&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), pp. 223ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''locum ubi &lt;u&gt;esset&lt;/u&gt; facile inventūrōs'' (Nepos)&lt;ref&gt;Nepos, ''Hann.'' 12.3&lt;/ref&gt;
:'(he said that) they would easily find the place where &lt;u&gt;he was&lt;/u&gt;'

It also applies to all indirect questions:
*''quārē id &lt;u&gt;faciam&lt;/u&gt;, fortasse requīris'' ([[Catullus]])&lt;ref&gt;Catullus 85&lt;/ref&gt;
:'perhaps you ask why &lt;u&gt;I do&lt;/u&gt; this'

When used in indirect speech or in an indirect question, the subjunctive is translated as if were the corresponding tense of the indicative.

===Subjunctive after conjunctions===
The subjunctive mood is very frequently used in subordinate clauses following conjunctions.

====After ''cum''====
Used with the indicative, the conjunction ''cum'' means 'at that time when', or 'whenever':&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), pp. 370-373.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''cum tacent, clāmant'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Cat.'' 1.21&lt;/ref&gt; 
:'when they are silent, (it is as if) they are shouting'

Used with the subjunctive, however, it frequently means 'at a time when'.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), pp. 187ff.&lt;/ref&gt; When ''cum'' is used with the Imperfect subjunctive, a common way of translating it is 'while':
*''cum &lt;u&gt;sedērem&lt;/u&gt; domī trīstis, accurrit Venerius'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Ver.'' 2.4.32.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'while I was sitting sadly at home, Venerius suddenly came running up'

With the Pluperfect subjunctive, it often means 'after X happened':
*''cum excessisset Aegyptō Antiochus, lēgātī ... Cyprum nāvigant'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 45.12.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'after Antiochus had left Egypt, the ambassadors sailed to Cyprus'

It can also mean 'in view of the fact that' or 'since':&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), pp. 374-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''quae cum ita &lt;u&gt;sint&lt;/u&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Dom''. 142 et passim&lt;/ref&gt;
:'in view of the fact that these things are so' / 'since this is so'

Another, less common, meaning is 'though':&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nihil mē adiūvit, cum &lt;u&gt;posset&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Att.'' 9.13.8&lt;/ref&gt;
:'he did nothing to help me, though (or: at a time when) he could have done'

====After ''ut''====
When followed by the indicative, the conjunction ''ut'' can mean 'as' (e.g. ''ut fit'' 'as generally happens') or 'as soon as' or 'when' (''ut vēnī'' 'as soon as I came'). But with the subjunctive ''ut'' has the meaning 'that' or 'so that'.

It can represent purpose ('so that he could...'):&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), pp. 108ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Crētam vēnit ut ibī quō sē cōnferret &lt;u&gt;cōnsīderāret&lt;/u&gt;'' (Nepos)&lt;ref&gt;Nepos, ''Hann.'' 9.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'(Hannibal) came to Crete so that there &lt;u&gt;he could consider&lt;/u&gt; (in order to consider) where he should go to next'

It can also be used to introduce an indirect command ('that he should...'):&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), pp. 101ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''imperāvit eī ut omnēs forēs aedificiī &lt;u&gt;circumīret&lt;/u&gt;'' (Nepos)&lt;ref&gt;Nepos, ''Hann.'' 12.4&lt;/ref&gt;
:'he ordered him to go round (lit. 'that he should go round') all the doors of the building'

It can also represent result (making what is known as a "consecutive" clause):&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), pp. 114ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''idque sīc aedificāverat ut in omnibus partibus aedificiī exitūs &lt;u&gt;habēret&lt;/u&gt;'' (Nepos)&lt;ref&gt;Nepos, ''Hann.'' 12.3&lt;/ref&gt;
:'and he had built it in such a way that in all parts of the building it had exits'

Occasionally ''ut'' with the subjunctive can mean 'although'.&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt;

====After ''sī''====
After ''sī'' 'if', the subjunctive expresses an imagined or unreal situation:
*''quod, sī &lt;u&gt;interfectus essem&lt;/u&gt;, accidere nōn &lt;u&gt;potuisset&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Sest''. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
:'which, if I had been killed, could not have happened'

*''sī &lt;u&gt;revīvīscant&lt;/u&gt; et tēcum &lt;u&gt;loquantur&lt;/u&gt;, quid &lt;u&gt;respondēres&lt;/u&gt;?'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Fin.'' 4.22.61; cf Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'if they were to come to life and talk to you, what answer would you be making?'

====After ''nē''====
After ''nē'' 'that not', the subjunctive can express a negative purpose:
*''hīnc nē exīre &lt;u&gt;posset&lt;/u&gt;, ephorī valvās obstrūxērunt'' (Nepos)&lt;ref&gt;Nepos, ''Paus.'' 5.2.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'so that &lt;u&gt;he would not be able&lt;/u&gt; to escape from here, the [[ephor]]s blocked up the doors'

It can also introduce a negative indirect command:
*''nē propius sē castra &lt;u&gt;movēret&lt;/u&gt; petiērunt'' (Caesar)&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 4.9.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:'they requested him not to move his camp any nearer to them'

The conjunction ''nē'' can also express a fear; in this case, the word 'not' must be omitted from the English translation:&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), pp. 144-147.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''verēns nē &lt;u&gt;dēderētur&lt;/u&gt;'' (Nepos)&lt;ref&gt;Nepos, ''Hann.'' 9.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:'fearing that &lt;u&gt;he might be handed over&lt;/u&gt; to the enemy'

====After ''dum''====
When used with the indicative, ''dum'' means 'while' or 'as long as'. But when followed by the subjunctive, it often means 'until':&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Verginius dum collēgam &lt;u&gt;consuleret&lt;/u&gt; morātus (est)'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy 4.21.10&lt;/ref&gt;
:'Verginius waited until he had a chance to consult his colleague'

Another meaning is 'provided that':&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ōderint dum &lt;u&gt;metuant&lt;/u&gt;'' ([[Lucius Accius|Accius]])&lt;ref&gt;Accius, quoted in Cicero, ''Off.'' 1.28.97&lt;/ref&gt;
:'let them hate, provided that they fear'

====After ''priusquam''====
The conjunctions ''priusquam'' and ''antequam'' both mean 'before (something happened)'. If the event actually happened, the verb is usually in the indicative mood; but when the meaning is 'before there was a chance for it to happen', the verb is subjunctive:&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), pp. 369-370&lt;/ref&gt;
*''(collem) celeriter, priusquam ab adversāriīs &lt;u&gt;sentiātur&lt;/u&gt;, commūnit'' (Caesar)&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C.'' 1.54.4&lt;/ref&gt;
:'he fortified the hill quickly, before it could be noticed by the enemies'

====After ''quīn''====
The conjunction ''quīn'' (literally, 'how should it not be?') is always used after a negative verb or the equivalent, typically 'there is no doubt that', 'who does not know that...?', and so on. The words following ''quīn'' are always positive and usually state what was actually the case:&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), pp. 141-4; Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), pp. 356-357.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nōn dubitō quīn ad tē omnēs tuī &lt;u&gt;scrīpserint&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Fam.'' 5.8.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:'I have no doubt that all your friends will have written to you'
*''quis ignōrat quīn tria Graecōrum genera &lt;u&gt;sint&lt;/u&gt;?'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Flacc.'' 64&lt;/ref&gt;
:'who does not know that there are three kinds of Greeks?'

Another usage is after a negative verb such as 'I can't help doing' or 'he did not refrain from doing':
*''facere nōn possum quīn ... tibī grātiās agam'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Fam.'' 10.24.1 (letter from Plancus)&lt;/ref&gt;
:'I can't do otherwise than to thank you'
*''Antiochus nōn sē tenuit quīn contrā suum doctōrem librum &lt;u&gt;ēderet&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Ac.'' 2.4.12&lt;/ref&gt;
:'Antiochus did not refrain from publishing a book against his own teacher'

Equally it can be used in sentences of the kind 'A didn't happen without B also happening':
*''nūllum adhūc intermīsī diem quīn aliquid ad tē litterārum &lt;u&gt;darem&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Att.'' 7.15.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:'up to now I have not let a day go past without dropping you a line'

In sentences like the following, there is potential for confusion, since the ''quīn'' clause, though positive in Latin, is translated in English with a negative:
*''nēmo fuit militum quīn &lt;u&gt;vulnerārētur&lt;/u&gt;'' (Caesar)&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C.'' 3.55.3&lt;/ref&gt;
:'there was not one of the soldiers who was not wounded'
*''fierī nūllō modō poterat quīn Cleomenī &lt;u&gt;parcerētur&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Verr.'' 5.104&lt;/ref&gt;
:'it was quite impossible that Cleomenes would not be spared'

In the following context, the words after ''quīn'' express not what actually happened but what very nearly happened:
*''neque multum āfuit quīn castrīs &lt;u&gt;expellerentur&lt;/u&gt;'' (Caesar)&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C.'' 2.35.4&lt;/ref&gt;
:'nor were they far from being expelled from the camp'

===Subjunctive after ''quī'' 'who'===
====Generic====
The pronoun ''quī'' 'who' or 'which', when followed by a subjunctive, can mean 'a person such as' (generic):&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''quī modestē &lt;u&gt;pārat&lt;/u&gt;, vidētur quī aliquandō &lt;u&gt;imperet&lt;/u&gt; dignus esse'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Leg.'' 3.2.5&lt;/ref&gt;
:'he who obeys modestly, seems to be the sort of person who one day is worthy to rule'

====Purpose====
It can also mean 'in order to' (purpose):&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''lēgātōs Rōmam quī auxilium &lt;u&gt;peterent&lt;/u&gt; mīsēre'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 5.35.4&lt;/ref&gt;
:'they sent ambassadors to Rome to ask for help'

====Explanatory====
Another meaning is 'in view of the fact that' (giving an explanation), as in the following example, said jokingly of a [[consul]] who was elected on the last day of the year:&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''fuit mīrificā vigilantiā, quī suō tōtō cōnsulātū somnum nōn &lt;u&gt;vīderit&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''Fam''. 7.30.1&lt;/ref&gt; 
:'(Caninius) was of amazing vigilance, in view of the fact that he didn't see any sleep in the whole of his consulate!'

====Reported speech====
Another reason for using the subjunctive after ''quī'' is to show that the words of the ''quī'' clause are quoted or part of indirect speech:&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Paetus omnīs librōs quōs frāter suus &lt;u&gt;relīquisset&lt;/u&gt; mihī dōnāvit'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, Att. 2.1.12 &lt;/ref&gt;
:'Paetus made a gift to me of all the books which his brother had left him'

Clearly here Paetus had written or stated "I am giving you all the books which my brother left me", and Cicero is quoting his words indirectly to Atticus.

==The imperative mood==
===Ordinary imperative===
The [[imperative mood]] is used for giving direct orders. The active form can be made plural by adding ''-te'':
*''&lt;u&gt;dā&lt;/u&gt; mī bāsia mīlle, deinde centum!'' (Catullus)&lt;ref&gt;Catullus 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'give me a thousand kisses, then a hundred!'
*''&lt;u&gt;date&lt;/u&gt; dexterās fidemque!'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy 1.58.7&lt;/ref&gt;
:'give me your right hands and your oath!'

===Deponent imperative===
[[Deponent verb]]s such as ''proficīscor'' 'I set out' or ''sequor'' 'I follow' have an imperative ending in ''-re'' or -''minī'' (plural):
*''patent portae: &lt;u&gt;proficīscere&lt;/u&gt;!'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Cat.'' 1.10&lt;/ref&gt;
:'the gates are open: depart!'
*''&lt;u&gt;sequiminī&lt;/u&gt; mē hūc intrō ambae'' ([[Terence]])&lt;ref&gt;Terence, ''Hec.'' 793&lt;/ref&gt;
:'follow me this way inside, both of you'

===Negative commands===
An imperative is usually made negative by using ''nōlī(te)'' (literally, 'be unwilling!') plus the infinitive. However, in poetry an imperative can sometimes be made negative with the particle ''nē'':
*''&lt;u&gt;nōlīte&lt;/u&gt; mīrārī'' ([[Seneca the Elder]])&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Elder, ''Controv.'' 7.7.2&lt;/ref&gt;
:'don't be surprised'
*''&lt;u&gt;nē&lt;/u&gt; mē &lt;u&gt;terrēte&lt;/u&gt; timentem, obscēnae volucrēs!'' (Virgil)&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, Aen. 12.875&lt;/ref&gt;
:'do not terrify me, who am already scared, obscene birds!'

A negative order can also use the perfect subjunctive:&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''dē mē nihil timuerīs'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Att.'' 4.17.4.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'do not be afraid on my account'

===Future imperative===
Latin also has a Future imperative or 2nd imperative,&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; ending in ''-tō(te)'', used to request someone to do something at a future time, or if something else happens first:
*''sī quid acciderit, ... &lt;u&gt;scrībitō&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Att.'' 10.1.3&lt;/ref&gt;
:'if anything happens, write to me'

This imperative is very common in early writers such as Plautus and Cato:

*''ubi nōs lāverimus, sī volēs, &lt;u&gt;lavātō&lt;/u&gt;'' (Terence)&lt;ref&gt;Terence, ''Eunuchus'', 592.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'when we have finished washing, get washed if you wish'.

*''crūdam si edēs, in acētum &lt;u&gt;intinguitō&lt;/u&gt;.'' (Cato)&lt;ref&gt;Cato, ''de Agri Cultura'' 156.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'if you eat it (cabbage) raw, dip it in vinegar.'

Some verbs have only the Second Imperative, for example ''scītō'' 'know', ''mementō'' 'remember'.&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd person of this imperative is used in laws:

*''iūsta imperia &lt;u&gt;suntō&lt;/u&gt;, īsque cīvēs ... &lt;u&gt;pārentō&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de legibus'' 3.6.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'orders must be just, and citizens must obey them'

===Other ways of expressing a command===
Other requests are made with expressions such as ''cūrā ut'' 'take care to...', ''fac ut'' 'see to it that...' or ''cavē nē'' 'be careful that you don't...'&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''&lt;u&gt;cūrā&lt;/u&gt; ut valeās'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Att.'' 6.3.9.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'make sure you keep well'

The future indicative can be used for polite commands:&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Pīliae salūtem &lt;u&gt;dīcēs&lt;/u&gt; et Atticae'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Att.'' 16.6.4.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'will you please give my regards to Pilia and Attica?'

==The infinitive==
Although often referred to as a 'mood',&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Allen &amp; Greenough (1903), p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; the Latin infinitive is usually considered to be a verbal noun rather than a mood.&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 167; Woodcock (1959), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin has three infinitives in the active voice, and three passive. Since ''faciō'' is irregular in the passive ('to be done' is ''fierī'', taken from the verb ''fīō'' 'I become'), they are here shown using the verb ''capiō'' 'I capture':

Active:
*Present : ''capere'' : 'to capture, to be capturing'
*Perfect : ''cēpisse'' : 'to have captured'
*Future : ''captūrus esse'' : 'to be going to capture'

Passive:
*Present : ''capī'' : 'to be captured'
*Perfect : ''captus esse'' : 'to have been captured'
*Future : ''captum īrī'' : 'to be going to be captured'

The infinitives of ''sum'' 'I am' are ''esse'', ''fuisse'', and ''futūrus esse'' (often shortened to ''fore''). ''Possum'' 'I am able' has ''posse'' and ''potuisse'', ''volō'' 'I want' has ''velle'' and ''voluisse''. Neither of these verbs has a Future infinitive, and the Present infinitive is used instead.&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 334, note 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Future infinitive is used only for indirect statements (see below).&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 331, note 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The passive Future infinitive is rare, and is frequently replaced with a phrase using ''fore ut''.&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses of the infinitive===
The infinitive can be used as the subject, complement, or the object of a verb:&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''&lt;u&gt;vīvere&lt;/u&gt; est &lt;u&gt;cōgitāre&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''Tusc.'' 5.111&lt;/ref&gt;
:'to live is to think'
*''&lt;u&gt;errāre&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;nescīre&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;dēcipī&lt;/u&gt; ... turpe dūcimus'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Off.'' 1.18&lt;/ref&gt;
:'we consider &lt;u&gt;to be in error&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;to be ignorant&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;to be deceived&lt;/u&gt; as something shameful'

===Prolative infinitive===
It can also be used, as in English, dependent on an adjective, or with verbs such as ''possum'' 'I am able' or ''volō'' 'I want':
*''dulce et decōrum est prō patriā &lt;u&gt;morī&lt;/u&gt;'' (Horace)&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Carm.'' 3.2&lt;/ref&gt;
:'it is a sweet and glorious thing &lt;u&gt;to die&lt;/u&gt; for one's country'

*''nōn possum haec &lt;u&gt;ferre&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Att.'' 7.2.7&lt;/ref&gt;
:'I can't bear it'

It is likewise used, as in English, with verbs such as ''iubeō'' 'I order', ''vetō'' 'I forbid', ''patior'' 'I allow', ''volō'' 'I want' and so on, where the main verb takes an object in the accusative case: 
*''volō tē hoc &lt;u&gt;scīre&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''Att.'' 1.18.6&lt;/ref&gt;
:'I want you to know this'

However, other verbs of similar meaning, such as ''imperō'' 'I order', ''persuādeō'' 'I persuade', and ''hortor'' 'I urge', are not used with an infinitive, but with ''ut'' and the subjunctive mood:
*''hortātur mē &lt;u&gt;ut&lt;/u&gt; senātūi &lt;u&gt;scrībam&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Fam.'' 10.31.4&lt;/ref&gt;
:'he is urging me to write to the senate' (lit. 'that I should write')

===Historic infinitive===
An infinitive or a succession of infinitives is sometimes used to represent a rapid or confused series of actions:&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''&lt;u&gt;clāmāre&lt;/u&gt; omnēs'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Verr.'' 2, 2, 188&lt;/ref&gt;
:'everyone &lt;u&gt;began shouting at once&lt;/u&gt;'

===Accusative and infinitive===
A very common use of the infinitive in Latin, in which it differs from English, is its use for indirect statements, that is for sentences where a subordinate clause is dependent on a main verb such as 'he says', 'he knows', 'he pretends', 'he believes', 'he thinks' and so on. In Latin, instead of 'they pretend that they want', the idiom is to say 'they pretend themselves to want':
*''sē pācem &lt;u&gt;velle&lt;/u&gt; simulant'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Att.'' 14.15.2&lt;/ref&gt;
:'they pretend that they want peace'

Similarly 'I'm glad you've arrived safely' becomes 'I am glad you to have arrived safely':
*''salvom tē advēnisse gaudeō'' (Terence)&lt;ref&gt;Terence, ''Ph.'' 286&lt;/ref&gt;
:'I am glad you have arrived safely'

In this construction, the subject of the infinitive (''sē'', ''tē'' in the above examples) is in the accusative case.

So common is this construction in Latin, that often the verb 'he said' is simply omitted if it is clear from the context, the accusative and infinitive alone making it clear that the statement is reported:
*''rem atrōcem &lt;u&gt;incidisse&lt;/u&gt;'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy 1.58.5&lt;/ref&gt;
:'a terrible thing had happened (she said)'

===Other ways of expressing 'that'===
Not every subordinate clause which starts with the conjunction 'that' in English is translated with an accusative and infinitive. In some contexts ''ut'' with the subjunctive is required, for example after a verb of happening:&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''accidit cāsū &lt;u&gt;ut&lt;/u&gt; lēgātī Prūsiae Rōmae ... &lt;u&gt;cēnārent&lt;/u&gt;'' (Nepos)&lt;ref&gt;Nepos, ''Hann.'' 12.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:'it happened by chance that some ambassadors of King Prusias were dining in Rome'

In other circumstances a clause with ''quod'' 'the fact that' is used with the indicative:&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1895), p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''praetereō &lt;u&gt;quod&lt;/u&gt; eam sibī domum &lt;u&gt;dēlēgit&lt;/u&gt;'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Cluent.'' 66.188&lt;/ref&gt;
:'I omit the fact that he chose that house for himself'

This type of clause with ''quod'' (which became ''que'' in modern French, Portuguese and Spanish and ''che'' in Italian) gradually took over from the Accusative and infinitive construction and became the usual way of expressing indirect speech in modern [[Romance languages]] which are descended from Latin.

==Participles==
Unlike Greek, Latin is deficient in participles, having only three, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Present : ''faciēns'' (pl. ''facientēs'') : 'doing'
*Perfect : ''factus'' : '(having been) done'
*Future : ''factūrus'' : 'going to do'.

Thus, there is no passive present or future participle, and no active past participle. In deponent verbs, however, the Perfect participle is active in meaning, e.g. "profectus", 'having set out', "conatus" 'having tried'.

The verb ''sum'' 'I am' has no Present or Perfect participle, but only the Future participle ''futūrus'' 'going to be'.

The Romans themselves&lt;ref&gt;[[Aelius Donatus|Donatus]] ''Ars Minor: de participio''; Quintilian 9.3.9.&lt;/ref&gt; considered the gerundive (see below) also to be a participle, but most modern grammars treat it as a separate part of speech.

===Uses of participles===
====Adjectival participle====
Participles have endings like those of adjectives, and occasionally they are used as though they were adjectives. If so, they refer to the state or condition that a thing or person is in:&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''aquā &lt;u&gt;ferventī&lt;/u&gt; ... perfunditur'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Ver''. 2.1.67&lt;/ref&gt;
:'he was doused with &lt;u&gt;boiling&lt;/u&gt; water'

*''&lt;u&gt;occīsōs&lt;/u&gt; sepelīvit'' ([[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]])&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius, 2.11&lt;/ref&gt;
:'he buried the &lt;u&gt;dead&lt;/u&gt; (those who had been killed)'

====Participle as a verb====
More frequently, however, a participle is more like a verb, and if one action follows another, it can often replace the first of two verbs in a sentence:
*''Caesar Cascae bracchium &lt;u&gt;arreptum&lt;/u&gt; graphiō trāiēcit'' ([[Suetonius]])&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Jul.'' 82.2&lt;/ref&gt;
:'Caesar &lt;u&gt;grabbed&lt;/u&gt; [[Servilius Casca|Casca]]'s arm and stabbed it with his writing instrument'

Literally, 'Caesar with his writing instrument (''graphiō'') stabbed the arm (''bracchium''), which had been grabbed, for Casca' (''Cascae'' here is probably Dative of the Person Affected.)

Participles can frequently be translated into English using a clause with 'when':

*&lt;u&gt;quaerenti&lt;/u&gt;que viro 'satin salve?' 'minime' inquit.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 1.58.7&lt;/ref&gt;
:'and &lt;u&gt;when&lt;/u&gt; her husband &lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt; "Are you all right?", she said "No!"

*''&lt;u&gt;cōnātus&lt;/u&gt;que prōsilīre aliō vulnere tardātus est'' (Suetonius)&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Jul.'' 82.2&lt;/ref&gt;
:'and &lt;u&gt;when he tried&lt;/u&gt; to leap forward he was slowed down (''tardātus'') by another wound'

'-ing' and 'who' are other possible translations:
*''&lt;u&gt;currēns&lt;/u&gt; Lepta vēnit'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Fam.'' 3.7.4&lt;/ref&gt;
:'Lepta came &lt;u&gt;running&lt;/u&gt;'

*''&lt;u&gt;strīctō&lt;/u&gt; gladiō, ad &lt;u&gt;dormientem&lt;/u&gt; Lucrētiam vēnit'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 1.52.8&lt;/ref&gt;
:'&lt;u&gt;drawing&lt;/u&gt; his sword, he came to Lucretia, &lt;u&gt;when she was sleeping&lt;/u&gt; / &lt;u&gt;who was sleeping&lt;/u&gt;'

Apart from 'when' and 'who', other translations are possible, such as 'if', 'since', or 'although':&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''oculus sē nōn &lt;u&gt;vidēns&lt;/u&gt;, alia cernit'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''T.D.'' 1.67&lt;/ref&gt;
:'&lt;u&gt;although it can't see&lt;/u&gt; itself, the eye discerns other things'

A participle phrase can also stand for a noun clause, as in the following example:&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), pp. 75-6.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''&lt;u&gt;captī&lt;/u&gt; oppidī signum ex mūrō tollunt'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 4.34.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:'they raised a sign from the wall that the town &lt;u&gt;had been captured&lt;/u&gt;' (lit. 'of the town having been captured')

Normally a Present participle represents an action which is simultaneous with the main event ('he came running'), and a Perfect participle represents one which has already happened ('after drawing his sword'). In the following example, however, the Perfect participle represents the result following the main action:
*''crīnīs scindit ... &lt;u&gt;solūtōs&lt;/u&gt;'' (Virgil)&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aen.'' 12.870&lt;/ref&gt;
:'she tore her hair, &lt;u&gt;making it loose&lt;/u&gt;'

Participles are much commoner in Latin than in English. Sometimes multiple participles can be used in a single sentence:
*''noctū lūmine &lt;u&gt;appositō&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;experrēcta&lt;/u&gt; nūtrīx animadvertit puerum &lt;u&gt;dormientem&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;circumplicātum&lt;/u&gt; serpentis amplexū. quō aspectū &lt;u&gt;exterrita&lt;/u&gt; clāmōrem sustulit.'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Div.'' 1.79&lt;/ref&gt;
:'in the night, in the light of a lamp &lt;u&gt;placed nearby&lt;/u&gt;, the nurse, &lt;u&gt;who had woken up&lt;/u&gt;, noticed that the boy, &lt;u&gt;while he was sleeping&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;had been wrapped around&lt;/u&gt; with the coils of a snake; &lt;u&gt;terrified&lt;/u&gt; by this sight, she raised a cry'

====Ablative absolute====
The phrase ''strīctō gladiō'' (lit. 'with drawn sword') above is an example of a common idiom in which a noun and participle are put in the Ablative case to represent the circumstances of the main event. This idiom is referred to as an "ablative absolute" and is comparable to the Greek [[genitive absolute]] or the English [[nominative absolute]].&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), p. 73-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples are:
*''in hostēs &lt;u&gt;signō datō&lt;/u&gt; impetum fēcērunt'' (Caesar)&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''Gal.'' 1.52.3&lt;/ref&gt;
:'when the signal was given (lit. 'with signal given'), they made an attack on the enemy'
*''at pater Aenēas, &lt;u&gt;audītō nōmine Turnī&lt;/u&gt;, dēserit mūrōs'' (Virgil)&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aeneid'' 12.697.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'but Father Aeneas, on hearing Turnus's name, immediately deserted the walls'

The present participle can also be used in an ablative absolute:
*''at illa &lt;u&gt;audientibus nōbīs&lt;/u&gt; 'ego ipsa sum' inquit 'hīc hospita' ''(Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''ad Att.'' 5.1.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'but she, while we were listening, said "I am just a guest here myself!"'
*''nec imperante nec sciente nec praesente dominō'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''in Milonem'' 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'without their master ordering it, or knowing, or even present'

The verb ''sum'' ('I am') has no participle, except in the compound forms ''absēns'' 'absent' and ''praesēns'' 'present'. To make an ablative absolute with 'to be', the words are put in the ablative, and the verb is simply omitted:
*''puerulō mē'' (Nepos)&lt;ref&gt;Nepos, ''Hannibal'' 2.3&lt;/ref&gt;
:'when I was a little boy'
*''hīs cōnsulibus Fīdēnae obsessae, Crustumeria capta'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 2.19.2&lt;/ref&gt;
:'when these men were consuls, Fidenae was besieged and Crustumeria captured'

==The gerundive==
{{further information|Gerundive}}

The gerundive is a verbal adjective ending in ''-ndus'' (''-nda'' etc. if feminine). It is usually passive in meaning (although a few [[deponent verb]]s can form an active gerund, such as ''secundus'' 'following' from ''sequor'' 'I follow').&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; The usual meaning of the gerundive is that it is necessary for something to be done. Often the word 'must' is a suitable translation:
*''nunc est &lt;u&gt;bibendum&lt;/u&gt;'' ([[Horace]])&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Carm.'' 1.37&lt;/ref&gt;
:'now it is necessary to drink' (i.e. 'now we must drink')
*''Catō inexpiābilī odiō &lt;u&gt;dēlendam&lt;/u&gt; esse Carthāginem ... prōnūntiābat'' ([[Florus]])&lt;ref&gt;Florus 1.31.15.4&lt;/ref&gt;
:'[[Cato the Elder|Cato]] with implacable hatred used to declare that [[Carthage]] must be destroyed'

If a word is added to show by whom the action must be done, this word is put in the dative case (e.g. ''nōbīs'' 'for us').&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it is passive in meaning, the gerundive is usually formed from transitive verbs. However, intransitive verbs such as ''eō'' 'I go' and ''persuādeō'' 'I persuade', which can be used passively in an impersonal construction, can also have an impersonal gerundive, ending in ''-um'':&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''mihī Arpīnum &lt;u&gt;eundum&lt;/u&gt; est'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, 13.9.2&lt;/ref&gt;
:'It is necessary for me to go to Arpinum' / 'I have to go to [[Arpino|Arpinum]]'
*''&lt;u&gt;persuādendum&lt;/u&gt; iūdicī est'' ([[Quintilian]])&lt;ref&gt;Quntilian, 7.3.15&lt;/ref&gt;
:'the judge has to be persuaded'

The gerundive after ''ad'' can also be used to express purpose (a use which it shares with the gerund, see below):&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''L. Septimium tribūnum militum ad &lt;u&gt;interficiendum&lt;/u&gt; Pompeium mīsērunt'' (Caesar)&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''Civ.'' 3.104.2&lt;/ref&gt;
:'they sent the military tribune Lucius Septimius &lt;u&gt;to kill&lt;/u&gt; [[Pompey]]'
*''hunc Dātamēs vīnctum ad rēgem &lt;u&gt;dūcendum&lt;/u&gt; trādit Mithridātī'' (Nepos)&lt;ref&gt;Nepos, ''Dat.'' 4.5&lt;/ref&gt;
:'[[Datames]] handed this man over in chains to Mithridates for him &lt;u&gt;to be led&lt;/u&gt; to the King'

==The gerund==
The gerund is a verbal noun ending in ''-ndum'' (accusative), ''-ndī'' (genitive), or ''-ndō'' (dative or ablative). Although identical in form to a neuter gerundive, and overlapping the gerundive in some of its uses, it is possible that it has a different origin.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerunds are usually formed from intransitive verbs,&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; and are mainly used in sentences such as the following where the meaning is 'by doing something', 'of doing something', or 'for the purpose of doing something'. A gerund is never used as the subject or direct object of a verb (the infinitive is used instead).
*''&lt;u&gt;veniendō&lt;/u&gt; hūc exercitum servāstis'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 7.35; ''servāstis'' is a contraction of ''servāvistis''.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'&lt;u&gt;by coming&lt;/u&gt; here, you have saved the army'
*''aqua nitrōsa ūtilis est &lt;u&gt;bibendō&lt;/u&gt;'' (Pliny the Elder)&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ''N.H.'' 31.32.59&lt;/ref&gt;
:'alkaline water is good &lt;u&gt;for drinking&lt;/u&gt;'
*''idōneam ad &lt;u&gt;nāvigandum&lt;/u&gt; tempestātem'' (Caesar)&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 4.23.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:'weather suitable (''idōneam'') for &lt;u&gt;sailing&lt;/u&gt;'
*''&lt;u&gt;sacrificandī&lt;/u&gt; causā, Delphōs ēscendī'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 42.42&lt;/ref&gt;
:'for the sake &lt;u&gt;of sacrificing&lt;/u&gt;, I climbed up to [[Delphi]]'

Occasionally a gerund can be made from a transitive verb and can take a direct object:&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), pp. 161-2&lt;/ref&gt;
*''subabsurda &lt;u&gt;dīcendō&lt;/u&gt; rīsūs moventur'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Or.'' 2.289&lt;/ref&gt;
:'&lt;u&gt;by saying&lt;/u&gt; incongruous things laughs (''rīsūs'') are raised'

They can also be formed from deponent verbs such as ''ingredior'' 'I enter':
*''aliīs timor hostium audāciam flūmen &lt;u&gt;ingrediendī&lt;/u&gt; dedit'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 22.56&lt;/ref&gt;
:'for others fear of the enemy gave them the boldness (''audāciam'') to enter (lit. &lt;u&gt;of entering&lt;/u&gt;) the river'

However, if the verb is transitive, a phrase made of noun + gerundive is often substituted for the gerund:&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''lignum āridum māteria est idōnea &lt;u&gt;ēliciendīs ignibus&lt;/u&gt;'' (Seneca)&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''N.Q.'' 2.22.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:'dry wood (''lignum'') is a suitable material &lt;u&gt;for striking fire&lt;/u&gt;'

==The supine==
The supine is a rarely used part of the verb ending in ''-tum'' or (in some verbs) ''-sum''. Although it is identical with the accusative case of verbal nouns such as ''adventus'' 'arrival', ''mōtus'' 'movement', etc., it differs from them in that it is a verb as well as a noun, and can sometimes take a direct object.

===Supine in -um===
The supine is normally used to express purpose, when combined with a verb of movement such as ''eō'' 'I go' or ''mittō'' 'I send':
*''&lt;u&gt;lūsum&lt;/u&gt; it Maecenās, &lt;u&gt;dormītum&lt;/u&gt; ego Vergiliusque'' (Horace)&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Serm.'' 1.5.48&lt;/ref&gt;
:'[[Maecenas]] goes &lt;u&gt;to play&lt;/u&gt; a game, Virgil and I &lt;u&gt;to sleep&lt;/u&gt;'
*''&lt;u&gt;spectātum&lt;/u&gt; veniunt, veniunt spectentur ut ipsae'' (Ovid)&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Ars'' 1.1.99&lt;/ref&gt;
:'(the girls) come &lt;u&gt;to watch&lt;/u&gt;, but they also come so that they can be looked at themselves'

In the following example it takes a direct object:
*''lēgātōs ad Caesarem mittunt &lt;u&gt;rogātum&lt;/u&gt; auxilium'' (Caesar)&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G." 1.11.2&lt;/ref&gt;
:'they send ambassadors to Caesar &lt;u&gt;in order to ask for&lt;/u&gt; help'

The accusative of the supine is also used to make the rare future passive infinitive ''&lt;u&gt;captum&lt;/u&gt; īrī'' 'to be going to be captured', which can be used in indirect statements referring to the future (see above):&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), pp. 112-3&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ante reditum eius negōtium confectum īrī putō'' (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Att.'' 11.16.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'I think the business will be completed before his return'

===Supine in -u===
There is another form of the supine, an Ablative in ''-ū'', found with certain verbs only. But this cannot take an object.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in phrases such as ''mīrābile dictū'' 'amazing to say', ''facile factū'' 'easy to do':&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1959), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''&lt;u&gt;dictū&lt;/u&gt; quam rē facilius est'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 40.35.13&lt;/ref&gt;
:'it is easier &lt;u&gt;in the saying&lt;/u&gt; than in reality'

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3500">'''Máel Sechlain Mac Áeda''' was the [[Archbishop of Tuam]] 1312 &amp;ndash; 10 August 1348.

==Background==
Máel Seachlainn Mac Áeda was a member of a [[Connacht]] family associated with the [[Kings of Connacht]]. They were natives of [[Maigh Seóla]], near [[Tuam]], and originally of the [[Clann Cosgraigh]], which was a branch of the [[Uí Briúin]] and kin to the [[Muintir Murchada]].

The surname is nowadays rendered McHugh, or more rarely, McCoy.

==Episcopal career==
Mac Áeda was elected archbishop of Tuam about March 1312, but not [[translated]] from [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Elphin|Elphin]] until 19 December 1312, and did not receive possession of the [[temporalities]] until 1 April 1313. Also known as Malachais Tuamensis or Malachi MacHugh, he died in 1348.

==Leabhair Mac Áeda==
He wrote what was described by O'Reilly as ''"a large volume of [[miscellaneous]] matter in Irish, containing, amongst other things, a catalogue of Irish kings from Niall Naoighiallach ([[Niall Noígíallach]]) to Roderick O'Conor ([[Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair]]). [[Sir James Ware]], in his account of Irish writers, says, it was extant in his time, and called the Book of Mac Aodha. We can not say where it is to be found at present."''

==Death==
His death does not seem to be recorded in any of the extant [[Irish annals]]. The cause of his death is unknown, but it may be related to [[The Black Death]] which was prevalent in Ireland at the time. The [[Annals of Connacht]] state that ''"A great plague raged in Ireland ... by which great numbers were carried off."''

[[Navajo language|Navajo]] is a "verb-heavy" language &amp;mdash; it has a great preponderance of verbs but relatively few nouns. In addition to verbs and nouns, Navajo has other elements such as [[pronoun]]s, [[clitic]]s of various functions, [[demonstrative]]s, [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals]], [[postposition]]s, [[adverb]]s, and [[grammatical conjunction|conjunction]]s, among others. [[Harry Hoijer]] grouped all of the above into a word-class he called ''particles'' (i.e., Navajo would then have verbs, nouns, and particles). Navajo has no separate words that correspond to the ''[[adjective]]s'' in English grammar: verbs provide the adjectival functionality.

==Verbs==
The key element in Navajo is the [[verb]]. Verbs are composed of an abstract [[Stem (linguistics)|stem]] to which [[inflection]]al or [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] [[prefix]]es are added. Every verb must have at least one prefix. The prefixes are affixed to the verb in a specified order.

The Navajo verb can be sectioned into different components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41572651|title=The Navajo verb system : an overview|last=Young|first=Robert W.|date=2000|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=9780826321725|edition=1st|location=Albuquerque, NM|oclc=41572651}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verb ''stem'' is composed of an abstract ''[[Root (linguistics)|root]]'' and an often fused suffix. The stem together with a "classifier" prefix (and sometimes other thematic prefixes) make up the verb ''theme''. The thematic prefixes are prefixes that are non-[[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]], have limited derivational function, and no longer have a clearly defined meaning. Examples of thematic prefixes, include the archaic '''yá-''' prefix, which only occurs on the verb stem '''-tééh/-tiʼ''' meaning "to talk" as in '''yáłtiʼ''' "he's talking". The ''theme'' is then combined with derivational prefixes that in turn make up the verb ''base''. Finally, inflectional prefixes (which Young &amp; Morgan call "paradigmatic prefixes") are affixed to the ''base'' — producing a complete Navajo verb.

===Verb template===
The prefixes that occur on a Navajo verb are added in specified more or less rigid order according to prefix type. This type of morphology is called a ''position class template'' (or ''slot-and-filler template''). Below is a table of a recent proposal of the Navajo verb template (Young &amp; Morgan 1987). [[Edward Sapir]] and Harry Hoijer were the first to propose an analysis of this type. A given verb does not have a prefix for every position. In fact, most Navajo verbs are not as complex as the template might suggest: the maximum number of prefixes is around eight.

The Navajo verb is composed of a verb stem and a set of prefixes. The prefixes can be divided into a conjunct prefix set and disjunct prefix set. The disjunct prefixes occur on the outer left edge of the verb. The conjunct prefixes occur after the disjunct prefixes, closer to the verb stem. Two types of prefixes can be distinguished by their different phonological behavior.

:{| class="wikitable" frame=void style="vertical-align:top; text-align:center; white-space:nowrap;"
|-
| '''disjunct prefixes'''
| '''conjunct prefixes'''
| '''stem'''
|}

The prefix complex may be subdivided into 11 positions, with some of the positions having even further subdivisions:

|-
! colspan="5" | disjunct prefixes

|-
| &lt;small&gt;postposition&lt;br&gt;object&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;"null&lt;br&gt;postposition"&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;adverbial-&lt;br&gt;thematic&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;iterative&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;plural&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;direct object&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;deictic&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;adverbial-&lt;br&gt;thematic&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;mode-&lt;br&gt;aspect&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;subject&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;classifier&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;stem&lt;/small&gt;
|}

Although prefixes are generally found in a specific position, some prefixes change order by the process of [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]. For example, prefix '''ʼa-''' (3i object pronoun) usually occurs before '''di-''', as in

: ''' ʼadisbąąs''' "I'm starting to drive some kind of wheeled vehicle along" [ ← ʼa- + di- + sh- + ł + -bąąs].

However, when '''ʼa-''' occurs with the prefixes '''di-''' and '''ni-''', the '''ʼa-''' metathesizes with '''di-''', leading to an order of '''di-''' + '''ʼa-''' + '''ni-''', as in

: '''diʼnisbąąs''' "I'm in the act of driving some vehicle (into something) &amp; getting stuck" [ ← di-ʼa-ni-sh-ł-bąąs ← ʼa- + di- + ni- + sh- + ł + -bąąs]

instead of the expected ''' ʼadinisbąąs''' (ʼa-di-ni-sh-ł-bąąs) (note also that '''ʼa-''' is reduced to '''ʼ-''').

Although the verb template model of analysis has been traditionally used to describe the Navajo verb, other analyses have been proposed by Athabascanists.

===Pronominal inflection===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
Navajo verbs have [[pronominal]] (i.e. pronoun) prefixes that mark both [[Subject (grammar)|subjects]] and [[Object (grammar)|objects]]. The prefixes can vary in certain modes, particularly the perfective mode (See [[Navajo grammar#Mode and aspect|Mode and Aspect]] section below for a discussion of modes). The prefixes are [[Inflection|inflected]] according to [[grammatical person|person]] and [[grammatical number|number]]. The basic subject prefixes (and their abbreviations as used by Young &amp; Morgan) are listed in the table below:

:{| class="IPA wikitable" frame=void style="vertical-align:top; text-align:center; white-space:nowrap;"
! rowspan="2" | Number !! colspan="2" | Subject prefixes !! colspan="2" | Object prefixes
|-
! Singular !! Dual-plural !! Singular !! Dual-plural
|-
! First (1)
| -sh- || -Vd- || shi- || rowspan="2" | nihi-
|-
! Second (2)
| ni- || -oh- || ni-
|-
! Third (3)
| colspan="2" rowspan="2" | -Ø- || colspan="2" | bi-
|-
! Third (3o)
| colspan="2" | yi-
|-
! Fourth (3a)
| colspan="2" | ji- || colspan="2" | ha- ~ ho-
|-
! Indefinite (3i)
| colspan="2" | ʼa- || colspan="2" | ʼa-
|-
! Space (3s)
| colspan="2" | ha- ~ ho- || colspan="2" | ha- ~ ho-
|-
! Reflexive
| colspan="2" | – || colspan="2" | (ʼá)-di-
|-
! Reciprocal
| colspan="2" | – || colspan="2" | ʼahi-
|}

The subject prefixes occur in two different positions. The first and second subject prefixes ('''-sh-''', '''-Vd-''', '''ni-''', '''-oh-''') occur in position 8 directly before the classifier prefixes. The fourth, indefinite, and "space" subject prefixes ('''ji-''', '''ʼa-''', '''ha-~ho-''') are known as "deictic subject pronouns" and occur in position 5. The third person subject is marked by the absence of a prefix, which is usually indicated with a zero prefix '''-Ø-''' in position 8. The object prefixes can occur in position 4 as direct objects, in position 1a as "null postpositions", or in position 0 as the object of postpositions that have been incorporated into the verb complex.

The [[Grammatical person#Additional persons|fourth person]] subject prefix '''ji-''' is a kind of [[obviative]] third person. It refers primarily to persons or personified animals (unlike the regular third person). It has a number of uses including:

* referring to the main character in narratives
* distinguishing between two third person [[referent]]s
* referring politely or impersonally to certain socially-distant individuals (e.g. when speaking to opposite-sex siblings and relatives through marriage, giving admonitions, speaking of the dead)
When used as an impersonal, it may be translated into English as "one" as in '''béésh bee n&lt;u&gt;ji&lt;/u&gt;néego hálaʼ da &lt;u&gt;ji&lt;/u&gt;igish''' "&lt;u&gt;one&lt;/u&gt; can cut one's hand playing with knives". The "space" prefix can be translated as "area, place, space, impersonal it" as in '''&lt;u&gt;ha&lt;/u&gt;lgai''' "the &lt;u&gt;area/place&lt;/u&gt; is white" and '''na&lt;u&gt;ha&lt;/u&gt;łtin''' "&lt;u&gt;it&lt;/u&gt; is raining". The prefix has two forms: '''ha-''' and '''ho-''' with '''ho-''' having derived forms such as '''hw-''' and '''hwi-'''.

An example paradigm for "to freeze" (imperfective mode) showing the subject prefixes:

:{| class="IPA wikitable" frame=void style="vertical-align:top; text-align:left; white-space:nowrap;"
!
! colspan="2" | Singular
! colspan="2" | Dual-Plural
|-
! First
| yishtin
| "I freeze"
| yiitin
| "we (2+) freeze"
|-
! Second
| nitin
| "you freeze"
| wohtin
| "you (2+) freeze"
|-
! Third
| colspan="4" style="text-align:center" | yitin "he/she/it/they freeze"
|-
! Fourth (3a)
| colspan="4" style="text-align:center" | jitin "he/she/they freeze"
|-
! Indefinite (3i)
| colspan="4" style="text-align:center" | atin "someone/something freezes"
|}

===Classifiers (transitivity prefixes)===
The "[http://www.glottopedia.de/index.php/Classifier_%28Athapaskan_linguistics%29 classifiers]" are prefixes of position 9 (the closest to the verb stem) that affect the [[Transitive verb|transitivity]] of the verb, in that they are [[Valency (linguistics)|valence]] and [[Grammatical voice|voice]] markers.  Calling them "classifiers" is a misnomer, however, as they do not classify anything and are not related to the classificatory verb stems (which actually do classify nouns, see [[Navajo language#Classificatory verbs|classificatory verbs]] below). There are four classifiers: '''-Ø-''', '''-ł-''', '''-d-''', '''-l-'''. The '''-Ø-''' classifier is the absence of a prefix, which is usually indicated by a null morpheme.

The '''-ł-''' classifier is a [[causative]]-transitivizing prefix of active verbs. It often can transitivize an intransitive '''-Ø-''' verb: '''yibéézh''' "it's boiling" (yi-Ø-béézh), '''yiłbéézh''' "he's boiling it (yi-ł-béézh); '''naʼniyęęsh''' "somethings flows about in a meandering fashion" (naʼni-Ø-yęęsh), '''naʼniłhęęsh''' "he's making it flow about in a meandering fashion" (naʼni-ł-yęęsh).

The '''-d-''' classifier occurs in most passive, mediopassive, reflexive, and reciprocal verbs that are derived from verbs with a '''-Ø-''' classifier: '''yizéés''' "he's singeing it" (yi-Ø-zéés), '''yidéés''' "it's being singed" (yi-d-zéés).

The '''-l-''' occurs in most passive, mediopassive, reflexive, and reciprocal verbs that are derived from verbs with a '''-ł-''' classifier: '''néíłtsááh''' "he's drying it" (ná-yi-ł-tsááh), '''náltsááh''' it's being dried" (ná-l-tsááh).

Some verbs can occur with all four classifier prefixes:

* '''siʼą́''' "roundish object lies in position" ('''-Ø-ʼą́''')
* '''haatʼą́''' "roundish object was taken up &amp; out (i.e. extracted)" ('''-d-ʼą́''')
* '''séłʼą́''' "I keep a roundish object in position" ('''-ł-ʼą́''')
* '''néshʼą́''' "I have my head in position" ('''-l-ʼą́''')

In other verbs, the classifiers do not mark transitivity and are considered thematic prefixes that simply are required to occur with certain verb stems.

===Mode and aspect===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
Navajo has a large number of [[Grammatical aspect|aspectual]], [[Grammatical mood|modal]], and [[Grammatical tense|tense]] distinctions that are indicated by verb stem alternations (involving vowel and tonal [[ablaut]] and [[suffixation]]) often in combination with a range of prefixes. These are divided into seven "modes" and approximately twelve aspects and ten subaspects. (Although the term ''mode'' is traditionally used, most of the distinctions provided by the modes are in fact aspectual.) Each Navajo verb generally can occur in a number of mode and aspect category combinations.

====Modes====
Navajo has the following verb modes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45732508|title=The Navajo verb : a grammar for students and scholars|last=Faltz|first=Leonard M.|date=1998|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=0826319025|edition=1st|location=Albuquerque|oclc=45732508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Imperfective
*Perfective
*Progressive
*Future
*Usitative
*Iterative
*Optative

The modes above have five distinct verb stem forms. For example, the verb meaning "to play, tease" has the following five stem forms for the seven modes:

{| class="IPA wikitable" frame=void style="vertical-align:top; text-align:left; white-space:nowrap;"
! Mode
! Stem Form
|-
| Imperfective
| -né
|-
| Perfective
| -neʼ
|-
| Progressive/Future
| -neeł
|-
| Usitative/Iterative
| -neeh
|-
| Optative
| -neʼ
|}

The progressive and future modes share the same stem form as do the usitative and iterative modes. The optative mode usually has the same verb stem as the imperfective mode, although for some verbs the stem forms differ (in the example "to play, tease" above, the imperfective and the optative stems are the same).

The [[Imperfective aspect|imperfective]] indicates an event/action that has begun but remains incomplete. Although this mode does not refer to [[grammatical tense|tense]], it is usually translated into English as a present tense form: '''yishááh''' "I'm (in the act of) going/coming", '''yishą́''' "I'm (in the act of) eating (something)". With the additional of adverbials, the imperfective can be used for events/actions in the past, present, or future. The mode is used in the second person for immediate [[Imperative mood|imperatives]]. The imperfective mode has a distinct imperfective stem form and four different mode-aspect prefix paradigms: (1) with a '''ni-''' terminative prefix in position 7 as in '''nishááh''' "I'm in the act of arriving", (2) with a '''si-''' stative prefix in position 7 as in '''shishʼaah''' "I'm in the act of placing a [[#Classificatory verbs|SRO]]" in '''dah shishʼaah''' "I'm in the act of placing a SRO up" (''dah'' "up"), (3) with no prefix in position 7, usually identified as a '''Ø-''' prefix, as in '''yishcha''' "I'm crying", (4) with either a '''yi-''' transitional or '''yi-''' [[semelfactive]] prefix in position 6 (and no prefix in position 7).

The [[Perfective aspect|perfective]] indicates an event/action that has been completed and usually corresponds to English past tense: '''yíyáʼ''' "I went/came/arrived", '''yíyą́ą́ʼ''' "I ate (something)". However, since the perfective mode is not a tense, it can be used to refer non-past actions, such as the future (where it may be translated as English "will have" + &lt;small&gt;VERB&lt;/small&gt;). The perfective mode has a distinct perfective stem form and four different prefix paradigms: (1) with a '''yí-''' perfective prefix with a high tone in position 7 as in '''yíchʼid''' "I scratched it", (2) with a '''ní-''' terminative prefix with a high tone in position 7 as in '''níyá''' "I arrived", (3) with a '''sí-''' stative prefix with high tone in position 7 as in '''sélį́į́ʼ''' "I roasted it", (4) with a '''yi-''' transitional prefix in position 6 (and '''Ø-''' in position 7) as in '''yiizįʼ''' "I stood up".

The [[Continuous and progressive aspects|progressive]] indicates an incomplete event/action that is ongoing without reference to the beginning or end of the event/action. This mode may be translated into English as &lt;small&gt;BE&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;small&gt;VERB&lt;/small&gt;-ing + "along": '''yishááł''' "I'm going/walking along", '''yishtééł''' "I'm carrying it along". The future mode is primarily a [[future tense]] — indicating a prospective event/action: '''deeshááł''' "I'll go/come", '''deeshį́į́ł''' "I'll eat (something)". The progressive mode has a '''yi-''' progressive prefix (in position 7), the future has a '''di-''' inceptive prefix (in position 6) and the '''yi-''' progressive prefix.

The usitative indicates a repetitive event/action that takes place customarily: '''yishááh''' "I usually go", '''yishdlį́į́h''' "I always drink (something)". The iterative is a [[frequentative]] indicating a recurrent event/action that takes place repeatedly and customarily: '''chʼínáshdááh''' "repeatedly go out" as in '''ahbínígo tłʼóóʼgóó chʼínáshdááh''' "I always (repeatedly) go outdoors in the morning" (''ahbínígo'' "in the morning", ''tłʼóóʼgóó'' "outdoors"), '''náshdlį́į́h''' "drink (something) repeatedly" as in '''nínádiishʼnahgo gohwééh náshdlį́į́h''' "I drink coffee when I get up" (''nínádiishʼnahgo'' "when I get up", ''gohwééh'' "coffee"). The iterative is distinguished from the usitative by a '''ná-''' repetitive prefix (in position 2) and also sometimes by a '''-d-''' or '''-ł-''' classifier prefix (in position 9).

The [[optative]] indicates a positive or negative desire or wish. The mode is used with the addition of adverbial [[Grammatical particle|particle]]s that follow the verb, such as '''laanaa''' and '''lágo''': '''nahółtą́ą́ʼ laanaa''' "I wish it would rain", '''nahółtą́ą́ʼ lágo''' "I hope it doesn't rain". With punctual verbs, the optative mode can be used to form a negative imperative: '''shinóółʼį́į́ʼ (lágo)''' "don't look at me!". In certain adverbial frames, the optative indicates positive or negative potential.

====Aspects and subaspects====
The Primary aspects:

* Momentaneous - punctually (takes place point in time)
* Continuative - indefinite span of time &amp; movement with specified direction
* Durative - indefinite span of time, non-locomotive uninterrupted continuum
* Repetitive - continuum of repeated acts or connected series of acts
* Conclusive - like durative but in perfective terminates with static sequel
* Semelfactive - single act in repetitive series of acts
* Distributive - distributive manipulation of objects or performance of actions
* Diversative - movement distributed among things (similar to distributive)
* Reversative - result in directional change
* Conative - attempted action
* Transitional - shift from one state to another
* Cursive - progression in a line through time/space (only progressive mode)

The subaspects:

* Completive - event/action simply takes place
* Terminative - stopping of action
* Stative - sequentially durative and static
* Inceptive - beginning of action
* Terminal - inherently terminal action
* Prolongative - arrested beginning or ending of action
* Seriative - interconnected series of successive separate &amp; distinct acts
* Inchoative - focus on beginning of non-locomotion action
* Reversionary - return to previous state/location
* Semeliterative - single repetition of event/action

Navajo modes co-occur with various aspects. For example, the verb "rain falls" can occur in the perfective mode with the momentaneous and distributive aspects: '''-tsąąʼ''' (perfective momentaneous), '''-tsįʼ''' (perfective distributive). As with the modes, different aspects have different stem forms even when in the same mode, as seen with the previous "rain falls" perfective stems. Thus, a given verb has a set of stem forms that can be classified into both a mode and an aspect category. Verb stem paradigms of mode and aspect are given below for two different verbs:

As can be seen above, some aspect and mode combinations do not occur depending mostly upon the semantics of the particular verb. Additionally, some aspects do not occur at all with a particular verb. The patterns of verb stem alternations are very complex although there is a significant amount of [[homophone|homophony]]. A particularly important investigation into this area of the Navajo verb is Hardy (1979).

===Classificatory verbs===

&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Noun class]] --&gt;

Navajo has verb stems that classify a particular object by its shape or other physical characteristics in addition to describing the movement or state of the object. Athabaskan linguistics identifies these as classificatory verb stems and  usually identifies them with an [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] label. The eleven primary classificatory "handling" verb stems appear listed below (in the perfective mode):

To compare with English, Navajo has no single verb that corresponds to the English word ''give''. To say the equivalent of ''Give me some hay!'', the Navajo verb '''níłjool''' (NCM) must be used, while for ''Give me a cigarette!'' the verb '''nítįįh''' (SSO) must be used. The English verb ''give'' is expressed by eleven different verbs in Navajo, depending on the characteristics of the given object.

In addition to defining the physical properties of the object, primary classificatory verb stems also can distinguish between the manner of movement of the object. The stems may then be grouped into three different categories:

# handling
# propelling
# free flight

''Handling'' includes actions such as carrying, lowering, and taking. ''Propelling'' includes tossing, dropping, and throwing. ''Free flight'' includes falling, and flying through space.

Using an example for the SRO category, Navajo has

# '''-ʼą́''' "to handle (a round object)",
# '''-neʼ''' "to throw (a round object)", and
# '''-l-tsʼid''' "(a round object) moves independently".

===yi-/bi- Alternation (animacy)===
Like most Athabaskan languages, Southern Athabaskan languages show various levels of [[animacy]] in its grammar, with certain nouns taking specific verb forms according to their rank in this animacy hierarchy.  For instance, Navajo nouns can be ranked by animacy on a continuum from most animate (a human or lightning) to least animate (an abstraction) (Young &amp; Morgan 1987: 65-66):

''humans/lightning → infants/big animals → midsize animals → small animals → insects → natural forces → inanimate objects/plants → abstractions''

Generally, the most animate noun in a sentence must occur first while the noun with lesser animacy occurs second.  If both nouns are equal in animacy, then either noun can occur in the first position. So, both example sentences (1) and (2) are correct.  The '''''yi-''''' prefix on the verb indicates that the 1st noun is the subject and '''''bi-''''' indicates that the 2nd noun is the subject.
:{{interlinear| lang = nav| number = (1)
|Ashkii atʼééd yiníłʼį́.
|boy girl yi-look
|'The boy is looking at the girl.'}}

:{{interlinear| lang = nav| number = (2)
|Atʼééd ashkii biníłʼį́.
|girl boy bi-look
|'The girl is being looked at by the boy.'}}

But example sentence (3) sounds wrong to most Navajo speakers because the less animate noun occurs before the more animate noun:
:{{interlinear| lang = nav| number = (3)
|*{{nbsp}}Tsídii atʼééd yishtąsh.
|bird girl yi-pecked
|'The bird pecked the girl.'}}

To express this idea requires that the more animate noun occur first, as in sentence (4):
:{{interlinear| lang = nav| number = (4)
|Atʼééd tsídii bishtąsh.
|girl bird bi-pecked
|'The girl was pecked by the bird.'}}

Note that although sentence (4) is translated into English with a passive verb, in Navajo it is not passive. Passive verbs are formed by certain ''classifier'' prefixes (i.e., transitivity prefixes) that occur directly before the verb stem in position 9. The ''yi-/bi-'' prefixes do not mark sentences as active or passive, but as [[direct–inverse language|direct or inverse]].

==Nouns==
Many concepts expressed using nouns in other languages appear as verbs in Navajo. The majority of true nouns are not inflected for number, and there is no case marking. Noun phrases are often not needed to form grammatical sentences due to the informational content of the verb.

There are two main types of nouns in Navajo:

# simple nouns and
# nouns derived from verbs (called ''deverbal nouns'')

The simple nouns can be distinguished by their ability to be inflected with a possessive prefix, as in

:{| class="wikitable"
! Noun stem || Gloss
| rowspan="3" |
! Possessed Noun stem || Gloss || Morpheme&lt;br /&gt;composition
|-
| ''{{spell-nv|béésh}}'' || "knife" || ''{{spell-nv|bibéézh}}'' || "her knife" || ''{{spell-nv|bi-}}'' (3rd person) + ''{{spell-nv|béézh}}'' "knife"
|-
| ''{{spell-nv|hééł}}'' || "pack" || ''{{spell-nv|shiyéél}}'' || "my pack" || ''{{spell-nv|shi-}}'' (1st person singular) + ''{{spell-nv|yéél}}'' "pack"
|}

Deverbal nouns are verbs (or verb phrases) that have been [[Nominalization|nominalized]] with a nominalizing [[enclitic]] or converted into a noun through [[Conversion (word formation)|zero derivation]] (that is, verbs that are used syntactically as nouns without an added nominalizer). An example of a nominalized verb is '''{{spell-nv|náʼoolkiłí}}''' "clock", which is derived from the verb '''{{spell-nv|náʼoolkił}}''' "it is moved slowly in a circle" and the enclitic nominalizer '''{{spell-nv|&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;í}}'''. Another example is the deverbal noun '''{{spell-nv|hataałii}}''' "singer" (from verb '''{{spell-nv|hataał}}''' "he sings" + nominalizing enclitic '''{{spell-nv|&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;ii}}'''). Converted deverbal nouns include '''{{spell-nv|chʼéʼétiin}}''' "exit, doorway" and '''{{spell-nv|Hoozdo}}''' "Phoenix, Arizona" — when used as verbs '''{{spell-nv|chʼéʼétiin}}''' may be translated into English as "something has a path horizontally out" and '''{{spell-nv|hoozdo}}''' as "place/space is hot". Deverbal nouns can potentially be long and complex, such as

:{|
| '''{{spell-nv|chidí naaʼnaʼí beeʼeldǫǫhtsoh bikááʼ dah naaznilígíí}}''' || &amp;nbsp; || "army tank"
|}

which is composed of

# the nominalized noun '''{{spell-nv|chidí naaʼnaʼí}}''' "caterpillar tractor" (which itself is composed of noun '''{{spell-nv|chidí}}''' "car", verb '''{{spell-nv|naaʼnaʼ}}''' "it crawls about", and nominalizer '''{{spell-nv|&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;í}}''')
# the noun '''{{spell-nv|beeʼeldǫǫhtsoh}}''' "cannon" (which, in turn, is composed of verb '''{{spell-nv|beeʼeldǫǫh}}''' "explosion/boom is made with it" and adjectival enclitic '''{{spell-nv|&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;tsoh}}''' "big")
# the postposition '''{{spell-nv|bikááʼ}}''' "on it"
# the verb '''{{spell-nv|dah naaznil}}''' "they sit up"
# the nominalizer '''{{spell-nv|&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;ígíí}}'''

===Possession===
Possession in Navajo is expressed with personal pronoun prefixes:

:{| class="IPA wikitable" frame=void style="vertical-align:top; text-align:left; white-space:nowrap;"
!
! Singular
! Dual
! Plural
|-
! First
| shi-
| nihi-
| danihi-
|-
! Second
| ni-
| nihi-
| danihi-
|-
! Third
| colspan="3" style="text-align:center" | bi-
|-
! Fourth (3o)
| colspan="3" style="text-align:center" | yi-
|-
! Fourth (3a)
| colspan="3" style="text-align:center" | ha-, hw-
|-
! Indefinite (3i)
| colspan="3" style="text-align:center" | a-
|}

Most of the time, these prefixes take a low tone, but in some nouns and postpositions, the final syllable of the prefix takes a high tone, such as '''shílaʼ''' "my hand," '''nihílaʼ''' "our/your hand."

The prefixes are also used when the possessor noun in a possessive phrase is a noun, as in '''Jáan bimá''' ''lit.'' "John his-mother," ''i.e.,'' "John's mother."

Navajo marks [[inalienable possession]] for certain nouns — relatives, body parts, homes and dens.  These nouns can only appear with a possessive prefix, as in '''shimá''' "my mother."  If one wishes to speak of ''mothers'' in general, the 3rd person indefinite prefix '''ʼa-''' "someone's" is used, '''amá'''.

==Postpositions==
Navajo uses a number of postpositions where [[Indo-European languages]] tend to favor prepositions; thus, all spatial and most other relations such as ''under'', ''on'', or ''above'' are expressed by using the possessive prefix in combination with a postposition. All postpositions are inalienable, meaning that a prefix or fusion with a true noun is mandatory.

Examples include ''biyaa'' (under it), ''bikááʼ'' (on it), and ''bitah'' (among it). These can be combined with all prefixes to construct forms such as ''shiyaa'' (under me). Occasionally, postpositions are fused with true nouns to form a single word, such as [[Dinétah]].

==Numerals==
Navajo uses a [[decimal]] (base-10) numeral system. There are unique words for the [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]]s 1-10. The numerals 11-19 are formed by adding an additive "plus 10" suffix '''{{spell-nv|-tsʼáadah}}''' to the base numerals 1-9. The numerals 20-100 are formed by adding a multiplicative "times 10" suffix '''{{spell-nv|-diin}}''' to the base numerals 2-10.

:{| class="wikitable"

|}

In the compound numerals, the combining forms of the base numerals have irregular vowel and consonants changes. The numeral "1" has three forms:

* '''{{spell-nv|łáaʼii}}''' (used in counting "one", "two", "three", etc.)
* '''{{spell-nv|-łaʼ-}}''' (a shortened combining form)
* '''{{spell-nv|tʼááłáʼí}}''' (used in larger numbers and with a distributive plural prefix)

The combining form '''{{spell-nv|łaʼ-}}''' is used in the compound '''{{spell-nv|łaʼ-tsʼáadah}}''' "11". The numeral '''{{spell-nv|tááʼ}}''' loses the final '''{{spell-nv|ʼ}}''' consonant while the final vowel in '''{{spell-nv|hastą́ą́}}''' is shortened when the '''{{spell-nv|-tsʼáadah}}''' "+10" suffix is added. The suffix loses its initial '''{{spell-nv|tsʼ}}''' becoming  '''{{spell-nv|-áadah}}''' when added to '''{{spell-nv|ashdlaʼ}}''' "5". Several changes occur when the '''{{spell-nv|-diin}}''' suffix is added involving a loss of the final consonant or a reduction in vowel length:

* '''{{spell-nv|naaki}}''' → '''{{spell-nv|naa-}}'''
* '''{{spell-nv|tááʼ}}''' → '''{{spell-nv|tá-}}'''
* '''{{spell-nv|dį́į́ʼ}}''' → '''{{spell-nv|díz-}}'''
* '''{{spell-nv|ashdlaʼ}}''' → '''{{spell-nv|ashdla-}}'''
* '''{{spell-nv|hastą́ą́}}''' → '''{{spell-nv|hastą́-}}'''
* '''{{spell-nv|tsostsʼid}}''' → '''{{spell-nv|tsostsʼi-}}'''
* '''{{spell-nv|tseebíí}}''' → '''{{spell-nv|tseebí-}}'''
* '''{{spell-nv|náhástʼéí}}''' → '''{{spell-nv|náhástʼé-}}'''
* '''{{spell-nv|neeznáá}}''' → '''{{spell-nv|neezná-}}'''

For the cardinal numerals higher than 20 between the multiples of 10 (i.e., 21-29, 31-39, 41-49, etc.), there are two types of formations. The numerals 21-29 and 41-49 are formed by suffixing the ones digit to the tens digit, as in '''{{spell-nv|naadįįnaaki}}''' "22" ( ← '''{{spell-nv|naadiin}}''' "20" + '''{{spell-nv|naaki}}''' "2") and '''{{spell-nv|dízdįįłaʼ}}''' "41" ( ← '''{{spell-nv|dízdiin}}''' "40" + '''{{spell-nv|-łaʼ}}''' "1"). Here the '''{{spell-nv|-diin}}''' suffix appears in the combining form '''{{spell-nv|-dįį-}}'''. The combining form '''{{spell-nv|-łá}}''' "1" is used as well:

:{| class="wikitable"
! colspan="2" | 20
| rowspan="12" style="background-color: lightgrey;" |
! colspan="2" | 40
|-
| {{spell-nv|naadiin}} || (20) || {{spell-nv|dízdiin}} || (40)
|-
! colspan="2" | 21-29
! colspan="2" | 41-49
|-
| {{spell-nv|naadįįłaʼ}} || (21) || {{spell-nv|dízdįįłaʼ}} || (41)
|-
| {{spell-nv|naadįįnaaki}} || (22) || {{spell-nv|dízdįįnaaki}} || (42)
|-
| {{spell-nv|naadįįtááʼ}} || (23) || {{spell-nv|dízdįįtááʼ}} || (43)
|-
| {{spell-nv|naadįįdį́į́ʼ}} || (24) || {{spell-nv|dízdįįdį́į́ʼ}} || (44)
|-
| {{spell-nv|naadįįʼashdlaʼ}} || (25) || {{spell-nv|dízdįįʼashdlaʼ}} || (45)
|-
| {{spell-nv|naadįįhastą́ą́}} || (26) || {{spell-nv|dízdįįhastą́ą́}} || (46)
|-
| {{spell-nv|naadįįtsostsʼid}} || (27) || {{spell-nv|dízdįįtsostsʼid}} || (47)
|-
| {{spell-nv|naadįįtseebíí}} || (28) || {{spell-nv|dízdįįtseebíí}} || (48)
|-
| {{spell-nv|naadįįnáhástʼéí}} || (29) || {{spell-nv|dízdįįnáhástʼéí}} || (49)
|}

The other numerals are formed by placing '''dóó baʼąą''' "and in addition to it" between the tens digit and the ones digit, as in '''tádiin dóó baʼąą tʼááłáʼí''' "thirty-one" and '''ashdladiin dóó baʼąą tʼááʼ''' "fifty-three". The numerals 41-49 may also be formed in this manner: "forty-two '''dízdiin dóó baʼąą naaki''' or '''dízdįįnaaki'''.

The cardinal numerals 100-900 are formed by adding the multiplicative enclitic '''=di''' to the base numerals 1-9 and adding the word for "hundred" '''neeznádiin''', as in '''tʼááłáhádí neeznádiin''' "one hundred", '''naakidi neeznádiin''' "two hundred", '''táadi neeznádiin''' "three hundred".

:{| class="IPA wikitable" frame=void style="vertical-align:top; text-align:left; white-space:nowrap;"
!  !! base numeral !! x100 (=di + neeznádiin)
|-
! 1
| tʼááłáʼí || tʼááłáhádí neeznádiin (100)
|-
! 2
| naaki || naakidi neeznádiin (200)
|-
! 3
| tááʼ || táadi neeznádiin (300)
|-
! 4
| dį́į́ʼ || dį́įʼdi neeznádiin (400)
|-
! 5
| ashdlaʼ || ashdladi neeznádiin (500)
|-

| hastą́ą́h || hastą́ądi neeznádiin (600)
|-
! 7
| tsostsʼid || tsostsʼidi neeznádiin (700)
|-
! 8
| tseebíí || tseebíidi neeznádiin (800)
|-
! 9
| náhástʼéí || náhástʼéidi neeznádiin (900)
|}

The base numerals with a high tone in the last syllable change to a falling tone before '''=di'''.

For the thousands, the word '''mííl''' (from Spanish ''mil'') is used in conjunction with '''=di''': '''tʼááłáhádí mííl''' "one thousand", '''naakidi mííl''' "two thousand", etc. The word for "million" is formed by adding the stem '''-tsoh''' "big" to '''mííl''': '''mííltsoh''' "million" as in '''tʼááłáhádí mííltsoh''' "one million", '''naakidi mííltsoh''' "two million", etc.

The woman is preparing to penetrate the man's anus with the dildo.|A woman pegging a man [[doggy style]] with a [[Strap-on dildo|4-strap harness]] and [[dildo]].]]

'''Pegging''' is a [[sexual practice]] in which a woman performs [[anal sex]] on a man by [[sexual penetration|penetrating]] the man's [[Human anus|anus]] with a [[strap-on dildo]]. This practice may also involve stimulating the [[male genitalia]].

The [[neologism]] "pegging" was popularized when it became the winning entry in a contest in [[Dan Savage]]'s "[[Savage Love]]" sex advice column, held after an observation was made that there was no common name or dictionary definition for the act in the [[English language]].&lt;ref name=sl&gt;These three links chronicle how the term ''pegging'' came into usage.

==Pleasurable aspects==

===Physical pleasure===
{{Main|Strap-on dildo}}
In terms of physical pleasure, a woman's [[genitals]] may get direct stimulation from the base of the dildo, or in the case of a [[double-ended dildo]], from vaginal (or internal) penetration. A woman can use a secondary [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrator]], between the dildo and her genitals, to get pleasure from pegging. Men may find stimulation of the anus, rectum, and especially the prostate, pleasurable. During anal sex, male pleasure can be particularly derived from the [[prostate]], which can lead to an [[orgasm]] and [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref name="Prostate massage"&gt;{{cite web|title= The male hot spot — Massaging the prostate|publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]]|date=March 28, 2008|url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2246.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010203540/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2246.html |archivedate=October 10, 2011 |accessdate=July 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men enjoy [[masturbation|masturbating]] (or being manually stimulated) during pegging.
Triple-ended dildos provide both vaginal and anal stimulation of the female partner.

===Psychological pleasure===
Advice columnist [[Dan Savage]] wrote that he believes all men should try pegging at least once, as it may introduce them to a new enjoyable sexual activity and illuminate them to the receiver's perspective in sex.&lt;ref name=sl/&gt;

==Instructional materials==
A few instructional movies and books have emerged in recent years, including ''[[Bend Over Boyfriend]]'' (1998), Based on a series of lectures and workshops by Robert Lawrence and [[Carol Queen]] and co-produced by Fatale Media, Inc. The movie was created and directed by Shar Rednour and Jackie Strano, SIR Video Movies co-founders. ''Bend Over Boyfriend'' originally inspired [[Dan Savage]] to call the act "BOBing" but his readers subsequently voted on the winning term, "pegging".&lt;ref name=nault&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]]|number=52|date=Summer 2010|title=Bend Over Boyfriend to Take it Like a Man: pegging pornography and the queer representation of straight sex|first=Curran|last=Nault|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc52.2010/naultPegging/ |accessdate=July 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American pornographic film director and sex educator [[Tristan Taormino]] released an instructional pegging movie in 2009 by [[Vivid Entertainment]] Studio, ''Tristan Taormino's Expert Guide to Anal Pleasure for Men'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bridges | first1 = Ana J. | last2 = Sun | first2 = Chyng | last3 = Wosnitzer | first3 = Robert | last4 = Scharrer | first4 = Erica | last5 = Liberman | first5 = Rachael | title = A comparison of male and female directors in popular pornography: what happens when women are at the helm? | journal = [[Psychology of Women Quarterly]] | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 312–325 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.2008.00439.x | date = September 2008 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a detailed explanation about male anal pleasure and strap-on dildo sex. In it, she teaches a workshop with instructions and skills for safe and pleasurable female on male anal sex. There are three scenes, in which pairs of pornographic actors explore different sexual devices and positions for pegging.

As an author of numerous sex guides and informational books on various sexual taboos, [[Violet Blue (author)|Violet Blue]] wrote and released ''The Adventurous Couple's Guide to Strap-On Sex'' in 2007.

Since 2010, the sex educator by the screen name of Ruby Ryder has been running a blog and podcast entitled ''Pegging Paradise''. As of September 2017, the podcast has over 166 episodes.&lt;ref name=peggingparadise&gt;[http://peggingparadise.com Ruby Ryder's Pegging Paradise].&lt;/ref&gt; She also runs the instructional site ''Pegging: 101'' which is especially targeting those interested in pegging with no interests in the association with BDSM. &lt;ref name=pegging101&gt;[http://pegging101.com Pegging: 101]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film==
The first pegging scene in film (long before the term was coined) appears to have been in the 1970 film ''[[Myra Breckinridge (film)|Myra Breckinridge]]'', based on the novel of the same name by [[Gore Vidal]], although it was not explicit. The first explicit pegging scene is believed to have been in the 1976 pornographic film ''[[The Opening of Misty Beethoven]]''.&lt;ref name=nault/&gt;

Female-to-male strap-on pornography became a popular subgenre in the early 21st century, with a number of studios producing dedicated series about it. Pegging films include ''Strap It On'', ''Babes Ballin Boys'', ''Strap Attack'', ''Strap-on Chicks'', ''Boss Bitches'', various films produced by LEDA Studios, as well as San Francisco-based BDSM themed website ''[[kink.com|Men In Pain]]''.

Female [[porn stars]] who expressed their pleasure in pegging their male partners include [[Taylor Wane]], [[Debi Diamond]], [[Brittany Andrews]], and [[Monique Covét]]. When questioned about her particular [[kink (sexual)|kink]], Covét replied, "If we women have to take it from behind, then why not a man?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budapestsun.com/news/54577 |title=Not just another Barbie |date=July 25, 2002 |work=[[The Budapest Sun]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302065043/http://www.budapestsun.com/news/54577 |archivedate=March 2, 2012 |accessdate=July 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

While not necessarily referred to as "pegging," the following [[popular culture]] works make reference at least to the concept.

*The [[Marquis de Sade]] describes a pegging act in his 1795 book ''[[Philosophy in the Bedroom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=La Philosophie dans le boudoir | trans-title=Filozofija v budoarju ali Nemoralni učitelj | first=Marquis | last=Sade | date=2010 | language=slovenian | location=Ljubljana | isbn=978-961-6789-14-1 | publisher=Center za slovensko književnost | page=110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy in the Boudoir: Or, The Immoral Mentors |page=74|isbn=978-0143039013|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14695">'''Polysyndeton''' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] πολύ ''poly'', meaning "many", and συνδετόν ''[[syndeton]]'', meaning "bound together with".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton|first=Gideon|title=Polysyndeton|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/figures/P/polysyndeton.htm|work=Rhetoric.byu.edu|publisher=Silva Rhetoricae|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stylistic scheme, polysyndeton is the deliberate insertion of [[Conjunction (grammar)| conjunction]]s into a sentence for the purpose of "slow[ing] up the rhythm of the prose" so as to produce "an impressively solemn note."&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[grammar]], a '''polysyndetic coordination''' is a [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] in which all conjuncts are linked by coordinating conjunctions (usually ''and'', ''but'', ''or'', ''nor'' in English).

==Examples==

A passage from [[The Book of Genesis]], 1:24-25 exemplifies the stately effect of polysyndeton: 

{{quote |''And God said, "Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind."  And it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps upon the earth to its kind. And God saw that it was good.''&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Author [[Ernest Hemingway]] employs the conjunction "and" to convey "a flow and continuity of experience" in a passage from his short story "[[Winner Take Nothing |After the Storm]]": 
{{quote| ''"I said, 'Who killed him?' and he said 'I don't know who killed him, but he's dead all right,' and it was dark and there was water standing in the street and no lights or windows broke and boats all up in the town and trees blown down and everything all blown and I got a skiff and went out and found my boat where I had her inside Mango Key and she was right only she was full of water."''&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The poet [[John Keats |Keats]] used conjunctions in a verse from [[Endymion (poem)| Endymion]]:  
{{quote| ''And soon it lightly dipped, and rose, and sank,
''And dipped again...''&lt;ref&gt;Baldick, 2008. P. 264&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In the King James Bible==
Polysyndeton is used extensively in the [[King James Version of the Bible]], where ''and'' is used as a literal translation of the Hebrew [[waw-consecutive]] and the Ancient Greek particle [[wikt:δέ|δέ]]. For example:

* "And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and [[Noah]] only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark." ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 7:22–24)
* "Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcass of an unclean beast, or a carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty." ([[Leviticus]] 5:2)
* "And Joshua, and all of Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had." ([[Joshua]] 7.24)

== In Shakespeare ==
[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] is known for using various rhetorical devices in his works, including polysyndeton.
* "When thou dost ask me blessing I'll kneel down and ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live and pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh at gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues talk of court news, and we'll talk with them too" (''[[King Lear]]'' 5.3.11–5)
* "Why, this is not a boon! 'Tis as I should entreat you to wear your gloves, or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, or sue you to do a peculiar profit to your person" (''[[Othello]]'' 3.3.85–9)
* "If there be cords, or knives, or poison, or fire, or suffocating streams, I'll not endure it" (''[[Othello]]'' 3.3.443–5)
* "Though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's, and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare" (''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' 2.5.42–5)
* "Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous-where is your mother?" (''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' 2.5.59–61)

==Modern usage==
Writers of modern times have also used the scheme:

* "There were frowzy fields, and cow-houses, and dunghills, and dustheaps, and ditches, and gardens, and summer-houses, and carpet-beating grounds, at the very door of the Railway. Little tumuli of oyster shells in the oyster season, and of lobster shells in the lobster season, and of broken crockery and faded cabbage leaves in all seasons, encroached upon its high places." ([[Charles Dickens]], ''[[Dombey and Son]]'', 1848)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Kenzie|title=Polysyndeton|url=http://prezi.com/t6wdyb7-gco8/polysyndeton/|publisher=Prezi|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Papa O. never knocked. He kicked the door in happily and shouted cheerfully, 'What you say, all peoples? How's t'ings, ever-body?' Papa O. pulled people out of bed and rattled pans and laughed at nothing and argued with unseen bartenders until somebody gave him sausage and eggs and coffee and bread and hung the accordion safely away." ([[Nelson Algren]], "How the Devil Came Down Division Street", 1944, in ''[[The Neon Wilderness]]'', 1947)
* "Let the whitefolks have their money and power and segregation and sarcasm and big houses and schools and lawns like carpets, and books, and mostly—mostly—let them have their whiteness." ([[Maya Angelou]], ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'', 1969)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gabriel|first=Jacob|title=Asyndeton and Polysyndeton|url=http://prezi.com/7rbdhtguue_r/asyndeton-and-polysyndeton/|publisher=Prezi|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Cormac McCarthy==
[[Cormac McCarthy]] used polysyndeton extensively throughout his ten novels (1965–2006), especially "and" to replace an increasing number of commas. (By ''[[The Border Trilogy]]'', commas are mostly used between unquoted voices and narration, as in: "Bring it here, he said.") Examples from each novel:

* Then the barrel of the gun shortening and withdrawing in the cup of his shoulder and his face bent to the stock and him walking into it, the black plume of smoke forming soundlessly about the muzzle and the shot popping into his leg, audible and painless in his flesh and him taking another step with the same leg and pitching forward as if he had stepped in a hole and then he could hear the shot. [...] The first night he built his fire and was sitting by it with his shotgun leaning against a tree and was sipping coffee from a canteen cup [...] (''[[The Orchard Keeper]]'', 1965)
* Now the entire herd had begun to wheel wider and faster along the bluff and the outermost ranks swung centrifugally over the escarpment row on row wailing and squealing and above this the howls and curses of the drovers that now up-reared in the moil of flesh they tended and swept with dust had begun to assume satanic looks with their staves and wild eyes as if they were no true swineherds but disciples of darkness got among these charges to herd them to their doom. [...] The hogs boiled past squealing and plunging and the chalky red smoke of their passage hung over the river and stained the sky with something of sunset. [...] He was dressed in a dusty frockcoat and carried a walking stick and he wore a pair of octagonal glasses on the one pane of which the late sun shone while a watery eye peered from the naked wire aperture of the other. (''[[Outer Dark]]'', 1968)
* They passed under flowering apple&lt;!--"appletrees", sic--&gt;trees and passed a log crib chinked with orange mud and forded a branch and came in sight of an aged clapboard house that stood in blue shade under the wall of the mountain. [...] Kirby turned his head to one side and gripped his nose between his thumb and forefinger and sneezed a gout of yellow snot into the grass and wiped his fingers on the knee of his jeans. (''[[Child of God]]'', 1973)
* Suttree looked at the ground and smiled and wiped his mouth with the back of his wrist and looked up again. [...] The skiff bobbed and slid heavily and the bilgewater surged. [...] Suttree stretched and rubbed his back and eyed the sun. It was already very hot. He went along the deck and pushed open the door and entered. (''[[Suttree]]'', 1979)
* The horse screamed and reared and the Apache struggled to keep his seat and drew his sword and found himself staring into the black lemniscate that was the paired bores of Glanton's double&lt;!--"doublerifle", sic--&gt;rifle. [...] Dust stanched the wet and naked heads of the scalped who with the fringe of hair below their wounds and tonsured to the bone now lay like maimed and naked monks in the bloodslaked dust and everywhere the dying groaned and gibbered and the horses lay screaming. [...] The judge wrote on and then he folded the ledger shut and laid it to one side and pressed his hands together and passed them down over his nose and mouth and placed them palm down on his knees. [...] He bows to the fiddlers and sashays backwards and throws back his head and laughs deep in his throat and he is a great favorite, the judge. He wafts his hat and the lunar dome of his skull passes palely under the lamps and he swings about and takes possession of one of the fiddles and he pirouettes and makes a pass, two passes, dancing and fiddling at once. (''[[Blood Meridian]]'', 1985)
* The mouths of the cans were lensed with tinted cellophane and they cast upon the sheeting a shadowplay in the lights and smoke of antic demon players and a pair of goshawks arched chittering through the partial darkness overhead. (''[[All the Pretty Horses (novel)|All the Pretty Horses]]'', 1992)&lt;ref&gt;Cormac McCarthy, ''[[All the Pretty Horses (novel)|All the Pretty Horses]]''. New York: Vintage Books/Random House, 1993, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;
* They were running on the plain harrying the antelope and the antelope moved like phantoms in the snow and circled and wheeled and the dry powder blew about them in the cold moonlight and their breath smoked palely in the cold as if they burned with some inner fire and the wolves twisted and turned and leapt in a silence such that they seemed of another world entire. (''[[The Crossing (McCarthy novel)|The Crossing]]'', 1994)
* They stood in the doorway and stomped the rain from their boots and swung their hats and wiped the water from their faces. [...] They stomped their boots again and crossed to the bar and stood and thumbed back their hats and propped their boots on the rail above the tiled drainway while the barman poured their whiskies. In the bloodred barlight and the drifting smoke they raised their glasses briefly and nodded as if to salute some fourth companion now lost to them and they tilted back the shots and set the empty glasses on the bar again and wiped their mouths with the backs of their hands. (''[[Cities of the Plain (novel)|Cities of the Plain]]'', 1998)
* The deputy left Chigurh standing in the corner of the office with his hands cuffed behind him while he sat in the swivelchair and took off his hat and put his feet up and called Lamar on the mobile. [...] He dropped his cuffed hands over the deputy's head and leaped into the air and slammed both knees against the back of the deputy's neck and hauled back on the chain. (''[[No Country for Old Men]]'', 2005)
* Out on the road the pilgrims sank down and fell over and died and the bleak and shrouded earth went trundling past the sun and returned again as trackless and as unremarked as the path of any nameless sisterworld in the ancient dark beyond. (''[[The Road]]'', 2006)

== In film ==
* "But all you have to do is knock on any door and say, 'If you let me in, I'll live the way you want me to live, and I'll think the way you want me to think,' and all the blinds'll go up and all the windows will open, and you'll never be lonely, ever again." (''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'', 1960, [[Spencer Tracy]] as "Henry Drummond")
* "And the Germans will not be able to help themselves from imagining the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels, and the edge of our knives. And the Germans will be sickened by us. And the Germans will talk about us. And the Germans will fear us. And when the Germans close their eyes at night, and their subconscious tortures them for the evil they’ve done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with." (''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', 2009, [[Brad Pitt]] as "Lieutenant Aldo Raine")&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ft7kkXO98c&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antonym==
It can be contrasted with [[asyndeton]], which is a coordination containing no conjunctions often manipulating the rhythm of a passage in the attempt to make a thought more memorable, and [[syndeton]], which is a coordination with one conjunction.

Two examples of asyndeton:

* "[[Veni, vidi, vici]]" ([[Julius Caesar]])&lt;ref name=Glossary&gt;{{cite web|title=A Glossary of Rhetorical Terms with Examples|url=http://mcl.as.uky.edu/glossary-rhetorical-terms#13|work=Modern &amp; Classical Languages, Literatures &amp; Culture|publisher=University of Kentucky|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "We shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardships, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty." ([[J. F. Kennedy]], [[inaugural address of John F. Kennedy|inaugural address]], 1961)&lt;ref name=Glossary /&gt;

An example of syndeton:

* "You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death, sneered at doom, and chuckled at catastrophe". ([[Wizard of Oz (character)|The Wizard]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', 1939)

A '''sign system''' is a key concept in [[semiotics]] and is used to refer to any system of [[sign (semiotics)|signs]] and relations between signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beynon-Davies P.|year=2010|title=Dances with bees: exploring the relevance of the study of animal communication to informatics|journal=International Journal of Information Management|volume=30|number=1|pages=185–198|doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2010.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[language]]'' is frequently used as a synonym for a sign-system. However, the term ''sign-system'' is preferable to the term ''language'' for a number of reasons. First, the use of the term ''language'' tends to carry with it [[connotation]]s of human language, particularly human spoken language. Human spoken language is only one example of a sign-system; albeit probably one of the most complex sign-systems known.

For example, in traditional forms of face-to-face communication, humans communicate through [[non-verbal communication|non-verbal]] as well as verbal sign-systems; colloquially, this can be referred to as [[body language]]. Hence, humans communicate a great deal by way of facial movements and other forms of bodily expression. Such expressions are also signs and an organised collection of such signs would be considered a sign system. Second, the same concept of a sign-system can be used in considering a vast range of  communication forms such as [[animal communication]] and [[Man-machine interface|man-machine communication]]. Examination of simpler forms of such systems of signs within non-human communication can help to illuminate some of the essence of [[communication]] and in particular can help to provide tentative answers to the question of the nature and function of communication.

The development of '''Singapore's Chinese characters''' can be divided into three periods:

# '''Before 1969''' : Used [[Traditional Chinese characters]]
# '''1969-1976''': The [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]] promulgated the ''Table of Simplified Characters'' ({{zh|t=簡體字表|s=简体字表|p=jiǎntǐzì biǎo}}), which differed from the [[Chinese Character Simplification Scheme]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]
# '''After 1976''': fully adopted the Simplified Chinese characters of the [[People's Republic of China]]. In 1977, the [[Second round of simplified Chinese characters|second attempt to simplify the characters]] was stopped, ending the long period of confusion associated with simplification.

==1969 Table of Simplified Characters==

The 1969 ''Table of Simplified Characters'' was also known as the "502 Table of Simplified Characters" or simply "502". This table listed a total of 502 commonly used Simplified Characters. It contains 11 characters unique to Singapore, 38 characters simplified in different ways compared to that of [[mainland China]], and 29 characters whose left or right radical were not simplified.

Simplification examples are as follows:

* {{zh|s=要 → 𡚩|labels=no}}
* {{zh|s=信 → 伩|labels=no}}
* {{zh|s=窗 → 囪|labels=no}}

* {{zh|s=剎 → 杀|labels=no}}

Different ways of simplification as compared to those of Mainland China

* {{zh|s=拨 → 𫝼|labels=no}}

[[File:Տյուսաբ.jpg|thumb|right|300x300px|Srpouhi Dussap]]

'''Srpouhi Dussap''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Սրբուհի Տիւսաբ&lt;ref&gt;The [[Traditional Armenian orthography|traditional spelling]] of her name. In the [[Reformed Armenian orthography|reformed orthography]] her name would be rendered Սրբուհի Տյուսաբ.&lt;/ref&gt;) (1840–1901) was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[feminist]] writer and the first [[female Armenian]] novelist. She was the sister of famed Ottoman Armenian politician [[Hovhannes Vahanian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ararat, Volume 29|year=1988|publisher=AGBU|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O1oqAQAAMAAJ&amp;q|accessdate=16 December 2012|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Dussap was born as Srpouhi Vahanian in the [[Ortaköy|Ortakoy]] district of [[Constantinople]] to a prosperous upper-class [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]] family. At the time, wealthy families regularly imitated the trends and customs of Western European, primarily French society. The young Dussap, being educated in Western European institutions, showed little interest in the [[Armenian language]]. However, after being tutored by revered Armenian poet Mkrtich Beshiktashlian, Dussap began to show a deep affection for the language as well as her heritage. Her first creative writing attempts were written in [[classical Armenian]].

[[File:Srpuhi tyusab.jpg|thumbnail|left]]
Dussap was married to a French musician, Paul Dussap, with whom she ran a European style salon where the city's prominent [[intellectual]]s, liberals, writers and [[activists]] would gather to discuss social and political issues, literature and poetry. She was active in philanthropic and charitable organizations that furthered the support and education of women.  Dussap's oeuvre reflects nineteenth century European trends. She wrote mainly in the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] style.

Dussap had two children, Dorine and Edgar.  Dorine died in 1891, after which Dussap ceased writing for publication.  Dussap died in 1901.

==Writings==
Dussap is the first Armenian writer who published works that today would be called feminist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
|title=Armenian Writers and Women's-Rights Discourse in Turn-of-the-Twentieth-Century Constantinople
 |journal=Aspasia |volume=2 |issue=1 |date=Spring 2008  |first=Victoria |last=Rowe |doi=10.3167/asp.2008.020104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest of these were a series of essays on the status of women's education and employment.  In 1883, she published the first novel by an Armenian woman, ''Mayda'', which treated the theme of women's unequal status.  Dussap's concern with female subordination, inferior education, and lack of financial independence was developed in the later novels ''Siranush'' (1884) and ''Araksia, or The Governess,'' (1887). 
 
She was very much concerned about the situation of the female peasantry of the [[Ottoman Empire]], attacking the traditional patriarchal structures behind their ignorance, and the male oppression that led to forced marriages in the countryside. She further noted that even in the more cultured and cosmopolitan Constantinople, women "were still deprived of their freedom and dominated by men." Dussap was certain that society would not be able to advance and progress without the emancipation of women. For these liberal ideas, she faced resentment from some prominent Armenian intellectuals, such as [[Krikor Zohrab]], but was esteemed by [[progressivist]]s.

==Legacy==
Dussap is regarded today as a pioneer in addressing female inequality and the need for female education. She was an inspiration to other Armenian women writers and journalists such as [[Zabel Yesayan]], who recalled reading her in her youth, "We used to read Madame Dussap's books together, and in the work of that feminist author, we tried to find solutions to the problems we faced." Later, she and her friends visited Dussap: "She immediately started asking questions and spoke to us with warmth and encouragement...Hearing that I hoped to become a writer, Madame Dussap tried to warn me.  She said that, for women, the world of literature was full of many more thorns than laurels.  She told me that in our day and age, a woman who wanted to carve out a place for herself in society was still not tolderated.  To overcome all of these obstacles, I needed to exceed mediocrity. ..She made a deep impression on us...We both agreed that in order to exceed mediocrity, we needed to go to Europe to continue our education." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gardens of Silihdar (translated by Jennifer Manoukian) |first=Zabel |last=Yessayan |publisher=AIWA Press, Armenian International  Women's Association |series=Treasury of Armenian Women's Literature | place=Boston | ISBN=9780964878785 | date = 2014 |pages=134–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Viable Paradise''' is an annual one-week residential [[writing workshop]] held each autumn on the island of [[Martha's Vineyard]] in [[Massachusetts]] and is focused on [[speculative fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zanzjan.net/vp/vp-sales.html|title=List of former V.P. students|website=Zanzjan.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The workshop began in 1997, as part of a science fiction convention presented by the Martha's Vineyard Science Fiction Association.  After 1998, the convention was discontinued, but the workshop continued.

'''XLIFF''' ('''XML Localization Interchange File Format''') is an [[XML]]-based format created to standardize the way localizable data are passed between tools during a [[Internationalization and localization|localization]] process and a common format for [[CAT tool]] exchange. XLIFF was standardized by [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] in 2002. Its current specification is v2.1&lt;ref name=current /&gt; released on 2018-02-13, which is backwards compatible with v2.0 released on 2014-08-05.

The specification is aimed at the localization industry. It specifies elements and attributes to store content extracted from various original file formats and its corresponding translation. The goal was to abstract the localization skills from the engineering skills related to specific formats such as HTML.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|author=Bert Esselink|url=http://isg.urv.es/library/papers/Esselink_Evolution.pdf|title=The Evolution of Localization|series=Guide to Localization|publisher=Multilingual Computing and Technology|year=2003|quote=Does the popularity of XLIFF signal a trend? Throughout the 1990s, the  localization industry tried to turn translators into semi-engineers. Is it now expecting them to just translate again? It certainly looks that way.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

XLIFF forms part of the [[Open Architecture]] for XML Authoring and Localization ([[OAXAL]]) reference architecture.


== XLIFF 2.0 and higher (the current OASIS ratified format) ==

The XLIFF Technical Committee is currently preparing to start working on XLIFF Version 2.2.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.oasis-open.org/xliff/FeatureTracking]&lt;/ref&gt;.
Prior to making of the major new version 2.0, much feedback had been gathered from XLIFF's user community which was successfully synthesized and implemented into the next generation version of the standard. Two of the primary methods used included compiling a list of extensions used by XLIFF toolmakers, and compiling a list of XLIFF features supported in each XLIFF tool.

* Makers of XLIFF tools have taken advantage of XLIFF's extensibility mechanism in order to implement a number of features. By collecting a list of these extension points, and analyzing them for common tasks, the XLIFF TC hopes to improve the XLIFF 2.0 Specification to include mechanisms that will enable the toolmakers to support these features without using extensibility.
* Makers of XLIFF tools have supported different sets of features in the XLIFF 1.2 Specification. By compiling a list of these features the XLIFF TC hopes to identify areas where the XLIFF 2.0 Specification can be improved to enable toolmakers to more widely support the specification.

On February 13, 2018 XLIFF 2.1 specification became an OASIS Standard&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oasis-open.org/news/announcements/xliff-v2-1-becomes-an-oasis-standard]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, 2017 XLIFF 2.0 specification was approved as ISO 21720:2017&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iso.org/standard/71490.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 6, 2014 the XLIFF 2.0 specification became an OASIS Standard&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oasis-open.org/news/announcements/xliff-version-2-0-becomes-an-oasis-standard Announcement of XLIFF 2.0 becoming an OASIS Standard]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, 2014, the XLIFF 2.0 specification was moved&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/xliff-comment/201405/msg00000.html 60-day Public Review for XLIFF Version 2.0 Candidate OASIS Standard announcement]&lt;/ref&gt; to Candidate OASIS Standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/xliff-core/v2.0/cos01/xliff-core-v2.0-cos01.html Candidate OASIS Standard 01]&lt;/ref&gt;


Example of an XLIFF 2.0 document:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;xliff xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:xliff:document:2.0" version="2.0"
 srcLang="en-US" trgLang="ja-JP"&gt;
 &lt;file id="f1" original="Graphic Example.psd"&gt;
  &lt;skeleton href="Graphic Example.psd.skl"/&gt;
  &lt;unit id="1"&gt;
   &lt;segment&gt;
    &lt;source&gt;Quetzal&lt;/source&gt;
    &lt;target&gt;Quetzal&lt;/target&gt;
   &lt;/segment&gt;
  &lt;/unit&gt;
  &lt;unit id="2"&gt;
   &lt;segment&gt;
    &lt;source&gt;An application to manipulate and process XLIFF documents&lt;/source&gt;
    &lt;target&gt;XLIFF 文書を編集、または処理 するアプリケーションです。&lt;/target&gt;
   &lt;/segment&gt;
  &lt;/unit&gt;
  &lt;unit id="3"&gt;
   &lt;segment&gt;
    &lt;source&gt;XLIFF Data Manager&lt;/source&gt;
    &lt;target&gt;XLIFF データ・マネージャ&lt;/target&gt;
   &lt;/segment&gt;
  &lt;/unit&gt;
 &lt;/file&gt;
&lt;/xliff&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== XLIFF 1.2 - legacy format ==

An XLIFF 1.2&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/xliff-core/xliff-core.html OASIS XLIFF 1.2 specification]&lt;/ref&gt; document is composed of one or more &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;file&gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements. Each &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;file&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element corresponds to an original file or source (e.g. database table). A &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;file&gt;&lt;/code&gt; contains the source of the localizable data and, once translated, the corresponding localized data for one, and only one, locale.

Localizable data are stored in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;trans-unit&gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;trans-unit&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element holds a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;source&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element to store the source text, and a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;target&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element to store the latest translated text. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;target&gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements are not mandatory.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;trans-unit id="1"&gt;
 &lt;source xml:lang="en"&gt;Cannot find the file.&lt;/source&gt;
 &lt;target xml:lang="fr"&gt;Fichier non trouvé.&lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/trans-unit&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The example below shows an XLIFF document storing text extracted from a Photoshop file (PSD file) and its translation in Japanese:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;xliff version="1.2"&gt;
 &lt;file original="Graphic Example.psd"
  source-language="en-US" target-language="ja-JP"
  tool="Rainbow" datatype="photoshop"&gt;
  &lt;header&gt;
   &lt;skl&gt;
    &lt;external-file uid="3BB236513BB24732" href="Graphic Example.psd.skl"/&gt;
   &lt;/skl&gt;
   &lt;phase-group&gt;
    &lt;phase phase-name="extract" process-name="extraction"
     tool="Rainbow" date="20010926T152258Z"
     company-name="NeverLand Inc." job-id="123"
     contact-name="Peter Pan" contact-email="ppan@example.com"&gt;
     &lt;note&gt;Make sure to use the glossary I sent you yesterday.
      Thanks.&lt;/note&gt;
    &lt;/phase&gt;
   &lt;/phase-group&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;trans-unit id="1" maxbytes="14"&gt;
    &lt;source xml:lang="en-US"&gt;Quetzal&lt;/source&gt;
    &lt;target xml:lang="ja-JP"&gt;Quetzal&lt;/target&gt;
   &lt;/trans-unit&gt;
   &lt;trans-unit id="3" maxbytes="114"&gt;
    &lt;source xml:lang="en-US"&gt;An application to manipulate and 
     process XLIFF documents&lt;/source&gt;
    &lt;target xml:lang="ja-JP"&gt;XLIFF 文書を編集、または処理
     するアプリケーションです。&lt;/target&gt;
   &lt;/trans-unit&gt;
   &lt;trans-unit id="4" maxbytes="36"&gt;
    &lt;source xml:lang="en-US"&gt;XLIFF Data Manager&lt;/source&gt;
    &lt;target xml:lang="ja-JP"&gt;XLIFF データ・マネージャ&lt;/target&gt;
   &lt;/trans-unit&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/file&gt;
&lt;/xliff&gt;

'''Ānanda''' (5th{{en dash}}4th centuries BCE) was the primary attendant of the Buddha and one of his [[the ten principal disciples|ten principal disciples]]. Among the Buddha's many disciples, Ānanda stood out for having the best memory. Most of the [[sutra|texts]] of the early Buddhist ''[[Sutta Pitaka|Sutta-Piṭaka]]'' ([[Pāli]]; {{lang-sa|Sūtra-Piṭaka|italic=yes}}) are attributed to his recollection of the Buddha's teachings during the [[First Buddhist Council]]. For that reason, he is known as the '''Treasurer of the Dhamma''', with ''[[Dhamma]]'' ({{lang-sa|Dharma|italic=yes |link=no}}) referring to the Buddha's teaching. In [[Early Buddhist Texts]], Ānanda is the first cousin of the Buddha. Although the early texts do not agree on many parts of Ananda's early life, they do agree that Ānanda is ordained as a monk and that [[Puṇṇa Mantāniputta]] ({{lang-sa|Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra|link=no}}) becomes his teacher. Twenty years in the Buddha's ministry, Ānanda becomes the attendant of the Buddha, when the Buddha selects him for this task. Ānanda performs his duties with great devotion and care, and acts as an intermediary between the Buddha and the laypeople, as well as the ''[[saṅgha]]'' ({{lang-sa|saṃgha|italic=yes|link=no|lit=monastic community}}). He accompanies the Buddha for the rest of his life, acting not only as an assistant, but also a secretary and a mouthpiece.

Scholars are skeptical about the historicity of many events in Ānanda's life, especially the First Council, and consensus about this has yet to be established. A traditional account can be drawn from early texts, [[atthakatha|commentaries]], and [[post-canonical Buddhist texts|post-canonical chronicles]]. Ānanda has an important role in establishing the order of ''[[bhikkhuni|bhikkhunīs]]'' ({{lang-sa|bhikṣuṇī|italic=yes|link=no |lit=nun}}), when he requests the Buddha on behalf of the latter's foster-mother [[Mahapajapati|Mahāpajāpati Gotamī]] ({{lang-sa|Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī|link=no}}) to allow her to be ordained. Ānanda also accompanies the Buddha in the last year of his life, and therefore is witness to many tenets and principles that the Buddha conveys before his death, including the well-known principle that the Buddhist community should take his teaching and discipline as their refuge, and that he will not appoint a new leader. The final period of the Buddha's life also shows that Ānanda is very much attached to the Buddha's person, and he sees the Buddha's passing with great sorrow.

Shortly after the Buddha's death, the First Council is convened, and Ānanda manages to attain [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]] just before the council starts, which is a requirement. He has a historical role during the council as the living memory of the Buddha, reciting many of the Buddha's discourses and checking them for accuracy. During the same council, however, he is chastised by [[Mahakassapa|Mahākassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mahākāśyapa|link=no}}) and the rest of the ''saṅgha'' for allowing women to be ordained and failing to understand or respect the Buddha at several crucial moments. Ānanda continues to teach until the end of his life, passing on his spiritual heritage to his pupils [[Shanavasa|Sāṇavāsī]] ({{lang-sa|Śāṇakavāsī|link=no}}) and Majjhantika ({{lang-sa|Madhyāntika|link=no}}), among others, who later assume a leading role in the [[Second Buddhist Council|Second]] and [[Third Buddhist Council|Third Councils]]. Ānanda dies 20 years after the Buddha, and ''[[stūpa]]s'' (momuments) are erected at the river where he dies.

Ānanda is one of the most loved figures in Buddhism. Ānanda is known for his memory, erudition and compassion, and is often praised by the Buddha for these matters. He functions as a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to the Buddha, however, in that he still has worldly attachments and is not yet enlightened, as opposed to the Buddha. In the [[agama (Buddhism)|Sanskrit textual traditions]], Ānanda is considered the patriarch of the Dhamma, who stands in a spiritual lineage, receiving the teaching from Mahākassapa and passing them on to his own pupils. Ānanda has been honored by ''bhikkhunīs'' since early medieval times for his merits in establishing the nun's order. In recent times, the composer [[Richard Wagner]] and Indian poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]] were inspired by stories about Ānanda in their work.

== Name ==
The word ''ānanda'' means 'bliss, joy' in Pāli and in Sanskrit.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Ānanda}}&lt;ref name="Larson"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Larson |first1=Paul |editor1-last=Leeming |editor1-first=David A. |editor2-last=Madden |editor2-first=Kathryn |editor3-last=Marlan |editor3-first=Stanton |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion |title=Ananda |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |isbn=978-0-387-71802-6 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pāli [[Atthakatha|Commentaries]] explain that when Ānanda is born, his relatives are joyous about this, and he therefore is named that way. Texts from the [[Mūlasarvāstivāda]] tradition, however, state that since Ānanda is born on the day of the Buddha's enlightenment, there is great rejoicing in the city{{em dash}}hence the name.{{sfn |Witanachchi |1965 |p=529}}

== Accounts ==
=== Previous lives ===
According to the texts, in a previous life, Ānanda makes an aspiration to become a [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]]'s attendant. He makes this aspiration in the time of a previous Buddha called [[Padumuttara]], many [[kalpa (aeon)|eons]] ({{lang-pi|kappa|italic=yes |link=no}}, {{lang-sa|kalpa|italic=yes |link=no}}) before the present time. He meets the attendant of Padumuttara Buddha and aspires to be like him in a future life. After having done many [[merit (Buddhism)|good deeds]], he makes his resolution known to the Padumuttara Buddha, who confirms that his wish will come true in a future life. After having been [[samsara|born and reborn]] through many lifetimes, and doing many good deeds, he is born as Ānanda in the present lifetime.{{sfn |Witanachchi |1965 |p=535}}

Following the [[Pāli Canon|Pāli]], [[Mahisasaka|Mahīśasaka]] and [[Dharmaguptaka]] textual traditions, Ānanda [[pabbajja|becomes a monk]] in the second year of the Buddha's ministry, during the Buddha's visit to Kapilavatthu ({{lang-sa|Kapilavastu|link=no}}). He is [[upasampada|ordained]] by the Buddha himself, together with many other princes of [[Sakiya|the Buddha's clan]] ({{lang-pi|Sākiya|link=no}}, {{lang-sa|Śākya|link=no}}),{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/aa/aananda.htm Ānanda]}}&lt;ref name="Mohr" /&gt; in the mango grove called Anupiya, part of [[Malla (India)|Malla]] territory.{{sfn |Witanachchi |1965 |p=529}} According to a text from the [[Mahāsaṅghika]] tradition, King Suddhodana wants the Buddha to have more followers of the ''[[ksatriya|khattiya]]'' caste ({{lang-sa|kṣatriyaḥ|italic=yes|link=no|lit=warrior-noble, member of the ruling class}}), and less from the [[brahmin]] (priest) caste. He therefore orders that any ''khattiya'' who has a brother must follow the Buddha as a monk, or have his brother do so.

In order to prevent Ānanda from leaving the palace to ordain, his father brings him to [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vesālī]] ({{lang-sa|Vaiśālī|link=no}}) during the Buddha's visit to Kapilavatthu, but the Buddha meets and teaches Ānanda later.{{sfn |Witanachchi |1965 |pp=529{{en dash}}30}} When Ānanda does become ordained, his father has him ordain in Kapilavatthu in the [[Nigrodharama|Nigrodhārāma]] monastery ({{lang-sa|Niyagrodhārāma|link=no}}) with much ceremony, Ānanda's [[upajjhaya (Buddhism)|preceptor]] ({{lang-pi|upajjhāya|italic=yes |link=no}}; {{lang-sa|upādhyāya|italic=yes |link=no}}) being a certain Daśabāla Kāśyapa. The Mahāvastu relates that Mṛgī is initially opposed to Ānanda joining the holy life, because his brother Devadatta has already ordained and left the palace. Ānanda responds to his mother's resistance by moving to Videha ({{lang-sa|Vaideha|link=no}}) and lives there, taking a vow of silence. This leads him to gain the epithet Videhamuni ({{lang-sa|Vaidehamuni|link=no}}), meaning 'the silent wise one from Videha'.{{sfn |Witanachchi |1965 |pp=529{{en dash}}30}}

According to the Pāli tradition, Ānanda's first teachers are Belaṭṭhasīsa and [[Puṇṇa Mantāniputta]]. It is Puṇṇa's teaching that leads Ānanda to attain the stage of ''[[sotāpanna]]'' ({{lang-sa|śrotāpanna|italic=yes |link=no}}), an attainment preceding that of enlightenment. Ānanda later expresses his debt to Puṇṇa.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/aa/aananda.htm Ānanda]}}{{sfn |Shaw |2006 |p=35}} Another important figure in the life of Ānanda is [[Sāriputta]] ({{lang-sa|Śāriputra|link=no}}), one of the Buddha's main disciples.

=== Attending the Buddha ===
[[File:MET 60 76.jpg|left|thumb |18th-century Burmese sculpture of Ānanda |alt=Wooden sculpture of monk sitting in a mermaid pose, reclining |upright]]

In the first twenty years of the Buddha's ministry, the Buddha has several personal attendants.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/aa/aananda.htm Ānanda]}} However, after these twenty years, when the Buddha is aged 55,&lt;ref name="Higham" /&gt;{{refn |group=note |According to [[Mūlasarvāstivāda]] tradition, the Buddha is 50.{{sfn |Witanachchi |1965 |p=530}}}} the Buddha announces that he has need for a permanent attendant.{{sfn |Keown |2004 |page=12}} The Buddha has been growing older, and his previous attendants did not do their job very well.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/aa/aananda.htm Ānanda]}} Initially, several of the Buddha's foremost disciples respond to his request, but the Buddha does  not accept them.&lt;!--both--&gt; All the while Ānanda remains quiet. When he is asked why, he says that the Buddha will know best who to choose,&lt;!--Malalasekera--&gt; upon which the Buddha responds by choosing Ānanda.{{refn|group=note |According to the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, Ānanda is born at the same time the Buddha becomes enlightened, and is therefore younger than the other leading disciples. The reason that the other disciples are not chosen may be because they are too old for the task.&lt;ref name="Mohr" /&gt;}} Ānanda agrees to take on the position, on the condition that he does not receive any material benefits from the Buddha.&lt;!--both--&gt; Accepting such benefits would open him up to criticism that he chose the position because of ulterior motives.&lt;!--Malalasekera--&gt; He also requests that the Buddha allows him to accept invitations on his behalf, allows him to ask questions about his doctrine, and repeats any teaching that has been taught in Ānanda's absence.{{sfn |Keown |2004 |page=12}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/aa/aananda.htm Ānanda]}} These requests would help people trust Ānanda and show that the Buddha was sympathetic to his attendant.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/aa/aananda.htm Ānanda]}} Furthermore, Ānanda considers these the real advantages of being an attendant, which is why he requests them.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Ānanda}}

The Buddha agrees to Ānanda's conditions, and Ānanda becomes the Buddha's attendant, accompanying the Buddha on most of his wanderings. Ānanda takes care of the Buddha's daily practical needs, by doing things such as bringing water and cleaning the [[Gandha Kuṭī|Buddha's dwelling place]]. He is depicted as observant and devoted, even guarding the Buddha's dwelling place at night.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/aa/aananda.htm Ānanda]}}{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Ānanda}} Ānanda takes the part of [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]] in many of the recorded dialogues.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt; He attends the Buddha for a total of 25 years,&lt;ref name="Powers" /&gt;{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/aa/aananda.htm Ānanda]}} a duty which entails much work.{{sfn |Findly |2003 |p=376}} His relationship with the Buddha is depicted as warm and trusting:&lt;ref name="Mcneill"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mcneill |first1=William |title=Berkshire Encyclopedia of World History |edition=2nd |date=2011 |publisher=[[Berkshire Publishing Group]] |isbn=978-1-61472-904-4 |page=270 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PpdgrgEACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Findly |2003 |p=375}} when the Buddha grows ill, Ānanda has a sympathetic illness;{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/aa/aananda.htm Ānanda]}} when the Buddha grows older, Ānanda keeps taking care of him with devotion.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Ānanda}}

Ānanda sometimes literally risks his life for his master. At one time, the rebellious monk  Devadatta tries to kill the Buddha by having a drunk and wild elephant released in the Buddha's presence. Ānanda steps in front of the Buddha to protect him. When the Buddha tells him to move, he refuses, although normally he always obeys the Buddha.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/aa/aananda.htm Ānanda]}} Through a [[ṛddhi|supernatural accomplishment]] ({{lang-pi|iddhi|italic=yes |link=no}}; {{lang-sa|ṛiddhi|italic=yes|likn=no}}) the Buddha then moves Ānanda aside and brings the elephant down, by touching it and speaking to it with [[mettā|loving-kindness]].{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/n/naalaagiri.htm Nālāgiri]}}

Ānanda often acts as an intermediary and secretary, passing on messages from the Buddha, informing the Buddha of news, invitations, or the needs of lay people, and advising lay people who want to provide gifts to the ''saṅgha''.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/aa/aananda.htm Ānanda]}}&lt;ref name="Bodhi"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Bodhi |first1=Bhikkhu |authorlink1=Bhikkhu Bodhi |editor1-last=Johnston |editor1-first=William M. |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Monasticism |date=2013 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |title=Early Buddhist Disciples |isbn=978-1-136-78716-4 |page=389 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iepJAgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one time, [[Mahapajapati|Mahāpajāpatī]], the Buddha's foster-mother, requests to offer robes for personal use for the Buddha. She says that even though she has raised the Buddha in his youth, she never gave anything in person to the young prince; she now wishes to do so. The Buddha initially insists that she give the robe to the community as a whole rather than to be attached to his person. However, Ānanda intercedes and mediates, arguing that the Buddha better accept the robe. Eventually the Buddha does, but not without pointing out to Ānanda that good deeds like [[dāna|giving]] should always be done for the sake of the action itself, not for the sake of the person.{{sfn |Findly |2003 |p=387}}

The texts say that the Buddha sometimes asks Ānanda to substitute for him as teacher,{{sfn |Shaw |2006 |p=18}}{{sfn |Findly |2003 |p=368}} and is often praised by the Buddha for his teachings.{{sfn |Findly |2003 |p=377}} Ānanda is often given important teaching roles, such as regularly teaching Queen [[Mallikā (Buddhist figure)|Mallikā]], Queen [[Samavati|Sāmāvatī]], ({{lang-sa|Śyāmāvatī|link=no}}) and other people from the ruling class.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Mallikā; Śyāmāvatī}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bailey |first1=Greg |last2=Mabbett |first2=Ian |title=The Sociology of Early Buddhism |date=2003 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-511-06296-4 |page=28 |url=http://www.khamkoo.com/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/the_sociology_of_early_buddhism_baileymabbett.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215105731/http://www.khamkoo.com:80/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/the_sociology_of_early_buddhism_baileymabbett.pdf |archive-date=15 February 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once Ānanda teaches a number of King [[Udayana (king)|Udena]] ({{lang-sa|Udayana|link=no}})'s concubines. They are so impressed by Ānanda's teaching, that they give him five hundred robes, which Ānanda accepts. Having heard about this, King Udena criticizes Ānanda for being greedy; Ānanda responds by explaining how every single robe is carefully used, reused and recycled by the monastic community, prompting the king to offer another five hundred robes.{{sfn |Findly |2003 |pp=389{{en dash}}90}} Ānanda also has a role in the Buddha's visit to [[Vaishali (ancient city)#Visits of the Buddha to Vaiśālī|Vesālī]].

In this passage, Ānanda states that spiritual friendship is half of the holy life; the Buddha corrects Ānanda, stating that such friendship is the entire holy life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Bodhi |first1=Bhikkhu |authorlink1=Bhikkhu Bodhi |editor1-last=Johnston |editor1-first=William M. |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Monasticism |date=2013 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |title=Discourses |isbn=978-1-136-78716-4 |page=394 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iepJAgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Shaw |2006 |page=12}} In summary, Ānanda works as an assistant, intermediary and a mouthpiece, helping the Buddha in many ways,&lt;!--377--&gt; and learning his teachings in the process.&lt;!--375--&gt;{{sfn |Findly |2003 |pp=375, 377}}

==== Resisting temptations ====
Ānanda is attractive in appearance.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/aa/aananda.htm Ānanda]}} A Pāli account relates that a ''bhikkhunī'' becomes enamored with Ānanda, and pretends to be ill to have Ānanda visit her.

=== Establishing the nun's order ===

{{See also|Bhikkhuni#History}}
In the role of mediator between the Buddha and the lay communities, Ānanda sometimes makes suggestions to the Buddha for amendments in the monastic discipline.{{sfn |Findly |2003 |pp=379{{en dash}}80}} Most importantly, the early texts attribute the inclusion of women in the early ''[[saṅgha]]'' (monastic order) to Ānanda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Violatti |first1=Cristian |title=Siddhartha Gautama |url=https://www.ancient.eu/Siddhartha_Gautama/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825002210/http://www.ancient.eu:80/Siddhartha_Gautama |archive-date=25 August 2014 |dead-url=no |website=Ancient History Encyclopedia |accessdate=29 August 2018 |date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen years after the Buddha's enlightenment, his foster mother Mahāpajāpatī comes to see him to ask him to be ordained as the first Buddhist ''bhikkhunī''. Initially, the Buddha refuses this. Five years later, Mahāpajāpatī comes to request the Buddha again, this time with a following of other Sākiya women, including the Buddha's former wife [[Yasodhara|Yasodharā]] ({{lang-sa|Yaśodarā|link=no}}). They have walked {{convert |500 |km |mile}}, look dirty, tired and depressed, and Ānanda feels pity for them. Ānanda therefore confirms with the Buddha whether women can become enlightened as well. Although the Buddha concedes this, he does not allow the Sākiya women to be ordained yet. Ānanda then discusses with the Buddha how Mahāpajāpatī took care of him during his childhood, after the death of [[Maya (mother of Buddha)|his real mother]].{{sfn |Ambros |2016 |page=241}}{{sfn |Ohnuma |2006 |page=862}} Ānanda also mentions that [[list of Buddhas|previous Buddhas]] have also ordained ''bhikkhunīs''.&lt;ref name="Powers 2015" /&gt;{{sfn |Ohnuma |2006 |pp=872{{en dash}}3}} In the end, the Buddha allows the Sākiya women to be ordained, being the start of the ''bhikkhunī'' order.{{sfn |Ambros |2016 |page=241}} Ānanda has Mahāpajāpati ordained by her acceptance of a set of rules, set by the Buddha. These are known as [[The Eight Garudhammas|the ''garudhamma'']], and they describe the subordinate relation of the ''bhikkhunī'' community to that of the ''[[bhikkhus]]'' or monks.{{sfn |Hinüber |2007 |pages=230{{en dash}}1}}{{sfn |Ohnuma |2006 |page=862}} Asian religion scholar Reiko Ohnuma argues that the debt the Buddha had toward his foster-mother Mahāpajāpati may have been the main reason for his concessions with regard to the establishment of a ''bhikkhunī'' order.{{sfn |Ohnuma |2006 |p=871}}

Many scholars interpret this account to mean that the Buddha is reluctant in allowing women to be ordained, and that Ānanda successfully persuaded the Buddha to change his mind. For example, Indologist and translator [[I.B. Horner]] wrote that "this is the only instance of his being over-persuaded in argument".{{sfn |Ohnuma |2006 |p=865}} However, some scholars interpret the Buddha's initial refusal rather as a test of resolve, following a widespread pattern in the [[Pāli Canon]] and in monastic procedure of repeating a request three times before final acceptance.&lt;ref name="Krey" /&gt;{{sfn |Ohnuma |2006 |page=865 n.9}} Some also argue that the Buddha was believed by Buddhists to be [[omniscience#Buddhism|omniscient]], and therefore is unlikely to have been depicted as changing his mind. Other scholars argue that other passages in the texts indicate the Buddha intends all along to establish a ''bhikkhunī'' order.{{sfn |Ohnuma |2006 |page=865}} Regardless, during the acceptance of women into the monastic order, the Buddha tells Ānanda that the Buddha's dispensation will last shorter because of this reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Jerryson |first1=Michael |editor1-last=Juergensmeier |editor1-first=Mark |editor2-last=Kitts |editor2-first=Margo |editor3-last=Jerryson |editor3-first=Michael |encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Violence |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |title=Buddhist Traditions and Violence |isbn=978-0-19-975999-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Hinüber |2007 |pages=230{{en dash}}1}} At the time, the Buddhist monastic order consisted of wandering celibate males, without many monastic institutions. Allowing women to join the Buddhist celibate life might have led to dissension, as well as temptation between the sexes.{{sfn |Powers |2007 |page=53}} The ''garudhamma'', however, are meant to fix these problems, and prevent the dispensation from being curtailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Buddhist Studies, [[Chulalongkorn University]] |volume=16 |issue=3 |year=2009 |script-title=ปัญหาการตีความพระพุทธตำรัสต่อพระอานนท์หลังการบวชของพระนางมหาปชาบดีโคตมี |language=th |trans-title=Problems in interpreting the Buddha's words to Ānanda after Mahāpajāpati Gotamī's ordination |first=Krisana |last=Raksachom |url=http://www.cubs.chula.ac.th/images/journal_Thai/v16_3.pdf#page=88 |archive-url=https://perma.cc/X7TK-M39J |archive-date=1 October 2018 |dead-url=no |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Chinese Bhiksuni Taiwan Vesak Festival.jpeg|upright|thumb |The early texts attribute the inclusion of women in the early monastic order to Ānanda. |alt=Taiwanese nun|left |upright=.6]]

There are some chronological discrepancies in the traditional account of the setting up of the ''bhikkhunī'' order. According to the Pāli and Mahīśasaka textual traditions, the ''bhikkhunī'' order is set up five years after the Buddha's enlightenment, but Ānanda only becomes attendant twenty years after the Buddha's enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Krey" /&gt; Furthermore, Mahāpajāpati is the Buddha's foster mother, and must therefore be considerably older than him. However, after the ''bhikkhunī'' order is established, Mahāpajāpati still has many audiences with the Buddha, as reported in Pāli and Chinese Early Buddhist Texts. Because of this and other reasons, it could be inferred that establishment of the ''bhikkhunī'' order actually takes place ''early'' in the Buddha's ministry. If this is the case, Ānanda's role in establishing the order becomes less likely.&lt;ref name="Mohr" /&gt; Some scholars therefore interpret the names in the account, such as ''Ānanda'' and ''Mahāpajāpati'', as symbols, representing groups rather than specific individuals.&lt;ref name="Krey"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Krey |first1=Gisela |editor1-last=Mohr |editor1-first=Thea |editor2-last=Tsedroen |editor2-first=Jampa |encyclopedia=Dignity and Discipline: Reviving Full Ordination for Buddhist Nuns |date=2014 |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] |title=Some Remarks on the Status of Nuns and Laywomen in Early Buddhism |isbn=978-0-86171-830-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qy8qAwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the texts, Ānanda's role in founding the ''bhikkhunī'' order makes him popular with the ''bhikkhunī'' community. Ānanda  often teaches ''bhikkhunīs'',{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Ānanda}}{{sfn |Findly |2003 |p=384}} often encourages women to ordain, and when he is criticized by the monk [[Mahakassapa|Mahākassapa]], several ''bhikkhunīs'' try to defend him.{{sfn |Ambros |2016 |page=209}}{{sfn |Hinüber |2007 |pages=233{{en dash}}4}} According to Indologist [[Oskar von Hinüber]], Ānanda's pro-''bhikkhunī'' attitude may well be the reason why there is frequent discussion between Ānanda and Mahākassapa, eventually leading Mahākasapa to charge Ānanda with several [[apatti (Buddhist monastic discipline)|offenses]] during the First Buddhist Council. Hinüber further argues that the establishment of the ''bhikkhunī'' order may have well been initiated by Ānanda after the Buddha's death, and the introduction of Mahāpajāpati as the person requesting to do so is merely a literary device to connect the female ordination with the Buddha through his foster mother. Hinüber concludes this based on several patterns in the early texts, including the apparent distance between the Buddha and the ''bhikkhunī'' order, and the frequent discussions and differences of opinion that take place between Ānanda and Mahākassapa.{{sfn |Hinüber |2007 |pages=235{{en dash}}7}} Some scholars have seen merits in von Hinüber's argument with regard to the pro- and anti-factions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ohnuma |first=Reiko |year= 2013 |title=Bad Nun: Thullanandā in Pāli Canonical and Commentarial Sources |journal=Journal of Buddhist Ethics |volume=20 |url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/files/2013/03/Ohnuma-Bad-Nun-Jan2013.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001213154/http://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/files/2013/03/Ohnuma-Bad-Nun-Jan2013.pdf |archive-date=1 October 2018 |dead-url=no |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Findly |1992 |pages=253{{en dash}}4}} but as of 2017, no definitive evidence has been found for the theory of establishment after the Buddha's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Muldoon-Hules |first1=Karen |title=Brides of the Buddha: Nuns' Stories from the Avadanasataka |date=2017 |publisher=[[Lexington Books]] |isbn=978-1-4985-1146-9 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SwglDwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist studies scholar [[Bhikkhu Analayo|Bhikkhu Anālayo]] has responded to most of Hinuber's arguments, writing: "Besides requiring too many assumptions, this hypothesis conflicts with nearly 'all the evidence preserved in the texts together'", arguing that it is monastic discipline that created a distance between the Buddha and the ''bhikkhunīs'', and even so, there are many places in the early texts where the Buddha does address ''bhikkhunīs'' directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anālayo |first=Bhikkhu |author-link=Bhikkhu Analayo |year=2008 |title=Theories on the Foundation of the Nuns’ Order: A Critical Evaluation |journal=Journal of the Centre for Buddhist Studies |volume=6 |url=https://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/pdf/5-personen/analayo/theories-foundation.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911044941/https://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/pdf/5-personen/analayo/theories-foundation.pdf |archive-date=11 September 2018 |dead-url=no |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of that a fellow monk Udāyī ({{lang-sa|Udāyin|link=no}}) ridicules Ānanda for this.

He further argues that enemies of Buddhism intended to use the poison to kill Ānanda, which would have been a heavy loss for the religion.

{{blockquote |"Moreover, this very beautiful episode, touching with nobility and psychological verisimilitude with regard to both Ānanda and the Buddha, seems to go back very far, at the time when the authors, like the other disciples, still considered the Blessed One [the Buddha] a man, an eminently respectable and undefiled master, to whom behavior and utterly human words were lent, so that one is even tempted to see there the memory of a real scene which Ānanda reportedly told to the Community in the months following the Parinirvāṇa [death]."{{sfn |Bareau |1979 |p=80 |ps=:"En outre, cet épisode très beau, touchant de noblesse et de vraisemblance psychologique tant en ce qui regarde Ânanda qu'en ce qui concerne le Buddha, paraît bien remonter très loin, à l'époque où les auteurs, comme les autres disciples, considéraient encore le Bienheureux comme un homme, un maître éminemment respectable mais nullement divinisé, auquel on prêtait un comportement et des paroles tout à fait humaines, de telle sorte qu'on est même tenté de voir là le souvenir d'une scène réelle qu'Ânanda aurait racontée à la Communauté dans les mois qui suivirent le Parinirvâna."}}}}

The same text contains an account in which the Buddha, at numerous occasions, gives a hint that he could prolong his life to a full eon through a supernatural accomplishment, but this is a power that he must be {{em|asked}} to exercise.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Māra}}{{refn |group=note |There was some debate between the [[early Buddhist schools]] as to what ''eon'' means in this context, some schools arguing it meant a full human lifespan, others that an enlightened being was capable of producing a "new life-span by the sole power of his meditation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jaini |first=P.

The Buddha gives several instructions before his death, including a directive that his former charioteer [[Channa (Buddhist)|Channa]] ({{lang-sa|Chandaka|link=no}}) be shunned by his fellow monks, to humble his pride.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Mahāparinibbānasuttanta}} In his final moments, the Buddha asks if anyone has any questions he wishes to pose to him, as a final chance to allay any doubts. When no-one responds, Ānanda expresses joy that all of the Buddha's disciples present have attained a level beyond doubts about the Buddha's teaching. However, the Buddha points out that Ānanda speaks out of [[faith in Buddhism|faith]] and not out of [[nyana|meditative insight]]{{em dash}}a final reproach.{{sfn |Findly |1992 |page=256}} He adds that, of all the five hundred monks that are surrounding him now, even the "latest" or "most backward" ({{lang-pi|pacchimaka|italic=yes |link=no}}) has attained the initial stage of ''sotapanna''.

However, Ānanda is unable to do so, indicating his lesser spiritual maturity.{{sfn |Ray |1994 |pp=369, 392 n.80}} After the Buddha's death, Ānanda recites several verses, expressing a [[samvega|sense of urgency]] ({{lang-pi|saṃvega|italic=yes |link=no}}), deeply moved by the events and their bearing: "Terrible was the quaking, men's hair stood on end, / When the all-accomplished Buddha passed away."{{sfn |Hansen |2008 |p=53}}

Shortly after the council, Ānanda brings the message with regard to the Buddha's directive to Channa personally. Channa is humbled and changes his ways, attains enlightenment, and the penalty is withdrawn.{{sfn |Prebish |2005 |page=226}}{{sfn |Mukherjee |1994 |p=466}} Ānanda travels to [[Savatthi|Sāvatthī]] ({{lang-sa|Śrāvastī|link=no}}), where he is met with a sad populace, who he consoles with teachings on impermanence. After that, Ānanda goes to the quarters of the Buddha and goes through the motions of the routine he formerly performed when the Buddha was still alive, such as preparing water and cleaning the quarters. He then salutes and talks to the quarters as though the Buddha was still there. The Pāli commentaries state that Ānanda does this out of devotion, but also because he is "not yet free from the passions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strong|first1=John S.|authorlink1=John S.

According to the texts, the First Buddhist Council is held in Rājagaha.&lt;ref name="Thorp" /&gt; In the first ''vassa'' after the Buddha has died, the presiding monk Mahākassapa ({{lang-sa |Mahākāśyapa|link=no}}) calls upon Ānanda to recite the discourses he has heard, as a representative on this council.{{sfn |Keown |2004 |page=12}}&lt;ref name="Thorp"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thorp |first1=Charley Linden |title=The Evolution of Buddhist Schools |url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/1043/the-evolution-of-buddhist-schools/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829212020/https://www.ancient.eu/article/1043/the-evolution-of-buddhist-schools/ |archive-date=29 August 2018 |dead-url=no |website=Ancient History Encyclopedia |accessdate=29 August 2018 |date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn |group=note |This is the most well-known version of the account.

Ānanda has, however, not attained enlightenment yet, in contrast with the rest of the council, consisting of 499 ''arahants''.{{sfn |Powers |2007 |p=56}}{{sfn |Prebish |2005 |pages=225{{en dash}}6}} Mahākassapa therefore does not allow Ānanda to attend yet.

Ānanda feels humiliated,&lt;!--Filigenzi--&gt; but is prompted to focus his efforts to reach enlightenment before the council starts.&lt;!--īryāpatha--&gt;{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Īryāpatha; Mahākāśyapa}}{{sfn |Filigenzi |2006 |page=271}} The Mūlasarvāstivāda texts add that he feels motivated when he remembers the Buddha's words to be his own refuge, and when he is consoled and advised by Anuruddha and Vajjiputta, the latter being his attendant.{{sfn |Witanachchi |1965 |p=532}} On the night before the event, he tries hard to attain enlightenment. After a while, Ānanda takes a break&lt;!--īryāpatha--&gt; and decides to lie down for a rest. He then attains enlightenment right there, right then, halfway between sitting and lying down. Thus, Ānanda is known as the disciple who attained awakening "in none of the [[īryāpatha|four traditional poses]]" (walking, standing, sitting, or lying down).&lt;!--Ānanda--&gt;{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Ānanda; Īryāpatha}}{{sfn |Shaw |2006 |pp=17{{en dash}}8}} The next morning, to prove his enlightenment, Ānanda performs a supernatural accomplishment by diving into the earth and appearing on his seat at the council (or, according to some sources, by flying through the air).{{sfn |Witanachchi |1965 |p=532}} Scholars such as Buddhologist [[André Bareau]] and religion scholar [[Ellison Banks Findly]] have been skeptical about many details in this account, including the number of participants on the council, and the account of Ānanda's enlightenment just before the council.{{sfn |Prebish |2005 |p=231}} Regardless, today, the story of Ānanda's struggle on the evening before the council is still told among Buddhists as a piece of advice in the practice of [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]]: neither to give up, nor to interpret the practice too rigidly.{{sfn |Shaw |2006 |pp=17{{en dash}}8}}

The First Council begins when Ānanda is consulted to recite the discourses and to determine which are authentic and which are not.{{sfn |Keown |2004 |page=164}}{{sfn |MacQueen |2005 |page=314}} Mahākassapa asks of each discourse that Ānanda lists where, when, and to whom it was given,{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Ānanda}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Zurcher |first1=Erik |editor1-last=Williams |editor1-first=Paul |encyclopedia=Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies, '''8''': Buddhism in China, East Asia, and Japan |date=2005 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |title=Buddhist Influence on Early Taoism |isbn=0-415-33234-6 |page=378 |url=https://ahandfulofleaves.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/buddhism_critical-concepts-in-religious-studies_paul-williams_vol8.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911192204/https://ahandfulofleaves.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/buddhism_critical-concepts-in-religious-studies_paul-williams_vol8.pdf |archive-date=11 September 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the end of this, the assembly agrees that Ānanda's memories and recitations are correct,{{sfn |Powers |2007 |pp=57{{en dash}}8}} after which the [[Sutta Pitaka|discourse collection]] ({{lang-pi|Sutta Piṭaka|italic=yes |link=no}}, {{lang-sa|Sūtra Piṭaka|italic=yes |link=no}}) is considered finalized and closed.{{sfn |MacQueen |2005 |page=314}} Ānanda therefore plays a crucial role in this council,&lt;ref name="Powers" /&gt; and texts claim he remembers 84,000 teaching topics, among which 82,000 taught by the Buddha and another 2,000 taught by disciples.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Council, 1st}}{{sfn |Lamotte |1988 |p=148}}{{refn |group=note |Other sources say he remembers 60,000 words and 15,000 [[stanza]]s,{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Council, 1st}} or 10,000 words.&lt;ref name="Gwynne"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gwynne |first1=Paul |title=World Religions in Practice: A Comparative Introduction |date=2017 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=978-1-118-97227-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=o08nDwAAQBAJ |chapter=Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Many early Buddhist discourses start with the words "[[Thus have I heard]]" ({{lang-pi|Evaṃ me suttaṃ|italic=yes |link=no}}, {{lang-sa|Evaṃ mayā śrutam|italic=yes |link=no}}), which according to most Buddhist traditions, are Ānanda's words,&lt;ref name="Gwynne" /&gt;{{refn |group=note |Some [[Mahāyāna]] commentators hold that in some cases these are the words of a ''[[bodhisattva]]'' (someone striving to become a [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]]) like [[Manjusri|Mañjuśrī]].{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Evaṃ mayā śrutam}}}} indicating that he, as the person reporting the text ({{lang-sa|saṃgītikāra|italic=yes |link=no}}), had first-hand experience and did not add anything to it.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Saṃgītikāra}}{{sfn |Lamotte |2005 |p=190}} Thus, the discourses Ānanda remembers later become the collection of discourses of the Canon,{{sfn |Keown |2004 |page=12}} and according to the [[Kāśyapīya|Haimavāta]], Dharmaguptaka and [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] textual traditions (and implicitly, post-canonical Pāli chronicles), the collection of [[Abhidhamma]] (''[[Abhidhamma Pitaka|Abhidhamma Piṭaka]]'') as well.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Council, 1st}}{{sfn |Prebish |2005 |p=230}}{{sfn |Norman |1983 |page=8}} Religious studies scholar Ronald Davidson notes, however, that this is not preceded by any account of Ānanda learning Abhidhamma.{{sfn |Davidson |1990 |page=305}} According to some later Mahāyāna accounts, Ānanda also assists in reciting Mahāyāna texts, held in a different place in Rājagaha, but in the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Lamotte |first1=Étienne |author-link=Étienne Lamotte |editor1-last=Williams |editor1-first=Paul |encyclopedia=Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies, '''3''': The Origins and Nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism |date=2005 |orig-year=1960 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |title=Mañjuśrī |isbn=0-415-33229-X |page=256|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Buddhism_Critical%20Concepts%20in%20Religious%20Studies_Paul-Williams_Vol_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Davidson |1990 |page=308}} The Pāli commentaries state that after the council, as the tasks for [[bhāṇaka|recitation and memorizing]] the texts are divided, Ānanda, and his pupils are given the task to remember the [[Digha Nikāya]].{{sfn |Witanachchi |1965 |p=532}}{{sfn |Norman |1983 |page=8}}

==== Charges ====
During the same council, Ānanda is charged for an offense by members of the ''saṅgha'' for having enabled women to join the monastic order.&lt;ref name="The Social Dimensions of Early Buddhism"&gt;{{cite book |first=Uma |last=Chakravarti |author-link=Uma Chakravarti |title= The Social Dimensions of Early Buddhism |publisher=[[Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Keown |2004 |page=164}} Besides this, he is charged for having forgotten to request the Buddha to specify which offenses of monastic discipline could be disregarded;{{refn |group=note |The Buddha mentioned to Ānanda that "minor rules" could be abolished.{{sfn |Powers |2007 |p=55}}}} for having stepped on the Buddha's robe; for having allowed women to honor the Buddha's body after his death, which was naked, and during which his body was sullied by their tears;&lt;!--Ananda, Council, 1st--&gt; and for having failed to ask the Buddha to continue to live on.&lt;!--three entries--&gt; Ānanda does not acknowledge these as offenses, but he concedes to do a formal confession anyway,&lt;!--Ananda--&gt; "... in faith of the opinion of the venerable elder monks"{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Ānanda; Cāpālacaitya; Council, 1st}}{{sfn |Hinüber |2007 |pp=235{{en dash}}6}}{{em dash}}Ānanda wants to prevent disruption in the ''saṅgha''.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |page=470}} With regard to having women ordained, Ānanda answers that he worked hard for that because Mahāpajāpati was the Buddha's foster-mother who had long provided for him.{{sfn |Ohnuma |2006 |p=867}} With regard to not requesting the Buddha to continue to live, many textual traditions have Ānanda respond by saying he was distracted by Māra,{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Cāpālacaitya}} though one early Chinese text has Ānanda reply he did not request the Buddha to prolong his life, for fear that this would interfere with the next Buddha [[Maitreya]]'s ministry.&lt;ref name="Ch'en" /&gt;

According to the Pāli tradition, the charges are laid after Ānanda has become enlightened and done all the recitations; but the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition has it that the charges are laid before Ānanda becomes enlightened and starts the recitations. In this version, when Ānanda hears that he is banned from the council, he objects that he has not done anything that goes against the teaching and discipline of the Buddha. Mahākassapa then lists seven charges to counter Ānanda's objection. The charges are similar to the five given in Pāli.{{sfn |Witanachchi |1965 |p=532}} Other textual traditions list slightly different charges, amounting to a combined total of eleven charges, some of which are only mentioned in one or two textual traditions.{{sfn |Tsukamoto |1963 |p=820}} Considering that an enlightened disciple was seen to have overcome all faults, it seems more likely that the charges were laid before Ānanda's attainment than after.&lt;ref name="Ch'en"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ch'en |first1=Kenneth |title=The Mahāparinirvānasūtra and The First Council |journal=[[Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies]] |date=1958 |volume=21 |page=132 |doi=10.2307/2718621 |jstor=2718621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indologists von Hinüber and [[Jean Przyluski]] argue that the account of Ānanda being charged with offenses during the council indicate tensions between competing [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist]] schools, i.e. schools that emphasized the [[sutra|discourses]] ({{lang-pi|sutta|italic=yes |link=no}}, {{lang-sa|sūtra|italic=yes |link=no}}) and schools that emphasized monastic discipline. These differences have affected the scriptures of each tradition:&lt;!--253--&gt; e.g. the Pāli and Mahīśāsaka textual traditions portray a Mahākassapa that is more critical of Ānanda than that the Sarvāstivāda tradition depicts them,&lt;!--254--&gt;{{sfn |Findly |1992 |pages=253{{en dash}}4}}{{sfn |Tsukamoto |1963 |p=821}} reflecting a preference for discipline above discourse on the part of the former traditions, and a preference for discourse for the latter.{{sfn |Findly |1992 |page=254}} Another example is the recitations during the First Council. The Pāli texts state that [[Upali|Upāli]], the person who is responsible for the recitation of the monastic discipline, recites {{em|before}} Ānanda does: again, monastic discipline above discourse.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=487}} Analyzing six textual traditions of the ''Mahāparinibbāna Sutta'' extensively, Bareau distinguished two layers in the text, an older and a newer one, the former belonging to the compilers that emphasized discourse, the latter to the ones that emphasized discipline; the former emphasizing the figure of Ānanda, the latter Mahākassapa.&lt;!--70--&gt; He further argued that the passage on Māra obstructing the Buddha was inserted in the fourth century BCE, and that Ānanda was blamed for Māra's doing by inserting the passage of Ānanda's forgetfulness in the third century BCE.&lt;!--79--&gt; The passage in which the Buddha is ill and reminds Ānanda to be his own refuge, on the other hand, Bareau regarded as very ancient, pre-dating the passages blaming Māra and Ānanda.{{sfn |Bareau |1979 |pages=70, 79{{en dash}}80}} In conclusion, Bareau, Przyluski and Horner argued that the offenses Ānanda are charged with are a later interpolation. Findly disagrees, however, because the account in the texts of monastic discipline fits in with the ''Mahāparinibbāna Sutta'' and with Ānanda's character as generally depicted in the texts.{{sfn |Findly |1992 |p=268}}

==== Historicity ====
Tradition states that the First Council lasts for seven months.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Council, 1st}} Scholars doubt, however, whether the entire canon was really recited during the First Council,{{sfn |Harvey |2013 |page=88}} because the early texts contain different accounts on important subjects such as meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gombrich |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard Gombrich |title=How Buddhism Began: The Conditioned Genesis of the Early Teachings |date=2006 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-415-37123-0 |pages=96{{en dash}}7 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be, though, that early versions were recited of what is now known as the ''[[Vinaya-pitaka|Vinaya-piṭaka]]'' and ''Sutta-piṭaka''.{{sfn |Hirakawa |1993 |p=69}} Nevertheless, many scholars, from the late 19th century onward, have considered the historicity of the First Council improbable. Some scholars, such as orientalists [[Louis de La Vallée-Poussin]] and D.P. Minayeff, thought there must have been assemblies after the Buddha's death, but considered only the main characters and some events before or after the First Council historical.{{sfn |Prebish |2005 |page=226}}{{sfn |Mukherjee |1994 |pp=453}} Other scholars, such as Bareau and Indologist [[Hermann Oldenberg]], considered it likely that the account of the First Council was written after the [[Second Buddhist Council|Second Council]], and based on that of the Second, since there were not any major problems to solve after the Buddha's death, or any other need to organize the First Council.{{sfn |Prebish |2005 |page=231}}{{sfn |Mukherjee |1994 |pp=454{{en dash}}6}} Much material in the accounts, and even more so in the more developed later accounts, deal with Ānanda as the unsullied intermediary who passes on the legitimate teaching of the Buddha.{{sfn |MacQueen |2005|pp=314{{en dash}}5}} On the other hand, archaeologist [[Louis Finot (archaeologist)|Louis Finot]], Indologist E. E. Obermiller and to some extent Indologist Nalinaksha Dutt thought the account of the First Council was authentic, because of the correspondences between the Pāli texts and the [[Agama (Buddhism)|Sanskrit traditions]].{{sfn |Mukherjee |1994 |p=457}}

Moreover, because of his ability to remember many teachings of the Buddha, he is described as foremost in "having heard much" ({{lang-pi|bahussuta|italic=yes |link=no}}, {{lang-sa|bahuśruta|italic=yes |link=no}}, {{Lang-zh|p=Duowen Diyi}}).{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013}}{{sfn |Findly |2003 |page=375}} Ānanda is known for his exceptional memory,&lt;ref name="Mohr" /&gt; which is essential in helping him to remember the Buddha's teachings. He also teaches other disciples to memorize Buddhist doctrine. For these reasons, Ānanda is known as the "Treasurer of the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dhamma]]" ({{lang-pi |Dhamma-bhaṇḍāgārika|italic=yes |link=no}}, {{lang-sa |Dharma-bhaṇḍāgārika|italic=yes |link=no}}),{{sfn |Filigenzi |2006 |p=271}}&lt;ref name="Sarao" /&gt; ''Dhamma'' ({{lang-sa|Dharma|link=no |italic=yes}}) referring to the doctrine of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Bodhi" /&gt; Being the person who has accompanied the Buddha throughout a great part of his life, Ānanda is in many ways the living memory of the Buddha, without which the ''saṅgha'' would be much worse off.{{sfn |Filigenzi |2006 |page=271}} Besides his memory skills, Ānanda also stands out in that, as the Buddha's cousin, he dares to ask the Buddha direct questions. For example, after the death of [[Mahavira|Mahāvira]] and the depicted subsequent conflicts among the [[Jain]] community, Ānanda asks the Buddha how such problems could be prevented after the Buddha's death.{{sfn |Clasquin |2013 |page=7}}{{sfn |Gethin |2001 |page=232}}{{refn |group=note |The Buddha responds with a discussion of the role of a teacher, a student and the teaching, and concludes that he has proclaimed his teaching well.&lt;!--232-3--&gt; He continues that disputes about [[vinaya|monastic discipline]] are not so much a problem, but disputes about "the path and the way" are.&lt;!--234--&gt;{{sfn |Gethin |2001 |pages=232{{en dash}}4}}}} Findly argues that Ānanda's duty to memorize the Buddha's teachings accurately and without distortion, is "both a gift and a burden". Ānanda is able to remember many discourses verbatim, but this also goes hand-in-hand with a habit of not reflecting on those teachings, being afraid that reflection may distort the teachings as he heard them. Thus, judgment of Ānanda's character depends much on whether one judges his accomplishments as a monk or his accomplishments as an attendant and person memorizing the discourses.{{sfn |Findly |2003 |pages=375{{en dash}}6}} At multiple occasions, Ānanda is warned by other disciples that he should spend less time on conversing to lay people, and more time on his own practice.&lt;!--372, 390--&gt; Even though Ānanda regularly practices meditation for long hours, he is less experienced in [[samadhi|meditative concentration]] than other leading disciples.&lt;!--391--&gt;{{sfn |Findly |2003 |pp=372, 390{{en dash}}1}}
[[File:039 Ananda (25595327227).jpg|left|thumb |East Javanese relief of Ānanda, depicted weeping |alt=Monk in forest rubbing in his eye. |upright=1.2]]
From a literary and pedagogical point of view, Ānanda often functions as a kind of [[foil (literature)|foil]] in the texts, being an unenlightened disciple attending an enlightened Buddha.{{sfn |Shaw |2006 |p=115}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Swearer |first1=Donald K. |title=The Buddhist World of Southeast Asia |date=1995 |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |isbn=978-0-7914-2459-9 |page=209 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kFBR2cMDD8sC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the run-of the-mill person can identify with Ānanda, the Buddha can through Ānanda convey his teachings to the mass easily.{{sfn |Shaw |2006 |p=115}}{{sfn |Findly |2003 |p=379}} Ānanda's character is in many ways a contradiction to that of the Buddha: being unenlightened and someone who makes mistakes. At the same time, however, he is completely devoted to service to the Buddha.{{sfn |Filigenzi |2006 |pages=270{{en dash}}1}} The Buddha is depicted in the early texts as both a father and a teacher to Ānanda, stern but compassionate. Ānanda is very fond of and attached to the Buddha, willing to give his life for him.{{sfn |Findly |2003 |page=375}} He mourns the deaths of both Sāriputta, with whom he enjoyed a close friendship, and the Buddha: in both cases Ānanda is very shocked.{{sfn |Witanachchi |1965 |p=533}} Ānanda's faith for the Buddha, however, constitutes more of a faith in others, especially the Buddha's person, as opposed to faith in the Buddha's teaching. This is a pattern which comes back in the accounts which lead to the offenses Ānanda is charged with during the First Council.{{sfn |Findly |1992 |pp=261{{en dash}}3}} Moreover, Ānanda's weaknesses are that he is sometimes slow-witted and lacks mindfulness, which becomes noticeable because of his role as attendant to the Buddha: this involves minor matters like deportment, but also more important matters, such as ordaining a man with no future as a pupil, or disturbing the Buddha at the wrong time.{{sfn |Findly |2003 |pp=378{{en dash}}9}} For example, one time Mahākassapa chastises Ānanda in strong words, criticizing the fact that Ānanda was travelling with a large following of young monks who appeared untrained and who had built up a bad reputation.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/aa/aananda.htm Ānanda]}} In another episode described in a Sarvāstivāda text, Ānanda is the only disciple who is willing to teach [[ṛddhi|psychic powers]] to Devadatta, who later uses these in a failed attempt to destroy the Buddha. According to a Mahīśāsaka text, however, when Devadatta turns against the Buddha, Ānanda is not persuaded by him, and votes against him in a formal meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bareau |first1=André |authorlink1=André Bareau |title=Les agissements de Devadatta selon les chapitres relatifs au schisme dans les divers Vinayapitaka |language=fr |trans-title=The Actions of Devadatta According to Chapters Related to Schism in the Various ''Vinayapitakas'' |journal=[[Ecole française d'Extrême-Orient|Bulletin de l'Ecole française d'Extrême-Orient]] |date=1991 |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=92, 94{{en dash}}5, 107, 109{{en dash}}10 |doi=10.3406/befeo.1991.1769 |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/befeo_0336-1519_1991_num_78_1_1769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ānanda's late spiritual growth is much discussed in Buddhist texts, and the general conclusion is that Ānanda is slower than other disciples due to his worldly attachments and his attachment to the person of the Buddha, both of which are rooted in his mediating work between the Buddha and the lay communities.{{sfn |Findly |2003 |p=373}}

=== Passing on the teaching ===
After the Buddha's death, some sources say Ānanda stays mostly in the West of India, in the area of [[Kosambi|Kosambī]] ({{lang-sa|Kausambī |link=no}}), where he teaches most of his pupils.{{sfn |Baruah |2000 |p=10}}{{sfn |Hirakawa |1993 |p=85}} Other sources say he stays in the monastery at [[Veḷuvana]] ({{lang-sa|Veṇuvana|link=no}}).{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Veṇuvanavihāra}} Several pupils of Ānanda became well-known in their own right. According to post-canonical Sanskrit sources such as the [[Divyavadana|Divyavadāna]] and the [[Asokavadana|Aśokavadāna]], before the Buddha's death, the Buddha confides to Ānanda that his student Majjhantika ({{lang-sa|Madhyāntika|link=no}}) will travel to Udyāna, [[Kashmir]], to bring the teaching of the Buddha there.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Madhyāntika}}{{sfn |Baruah |2000 |page=8}} Mahākassapa makes a prediction that later comes true that another of Ānanda's future pupils, [[Shanavasa|Sāṇavāsī]] ({{lang-sa|Śāṇakavāsī, Śāṇakavāsin or Śāṇāvasika|link=no}}), will make many gifts to the ''saṅgha'' at [[Mathura|Mathurā]], during a feast held from profits of successful business. After this event, Ānanda will successfully persuade Sāṇavāsī  to become ordained and be his pupil.{{sfn |Strong |1994 |p=65}}{{sfn |Baruah |2000 |pages=8, 453}} Ānanda persuades Sāṇavāsī by pointing out that he has now made many material gifts, but has not given "[[dhammadāna|the gift of the Dhamma]]". When asked for explanation, Ānanda explains that Sāṇavāsī will give the gift of Dhamma by becoming ordained as a monk, which is enough reason for Sāṇavāsī to make the decision to get ordained.{{sfn |Strong |1994 |p=65}}

Ānanda is teaching till the end of his life.{{sfn |Keown |2004 |page=12}} According to Mūlasarvāstivāda sources, Ānanda hears a young monk recite a verse incorrectly, and advises him. When the monk reports this to his teacher, the latter objects that "Ānanda has grown old and his memory is impaired ..." This prompts Ānanda to attain final Nirvana. He passes on the "custody of the [Buddha's] doctrine" to his pupil Sāṇavāsī&lt;!--Witanachchi--&gt; and leaves for the river Ganges.&lt;!--both--&gt;{{sfn |Witanachchi |1965 |pp=534{{en dash}}5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Relics of the Buddha|author=John S.

Ajāsattu is said to have built a ''stūpa'' on top of the Ānanda's relics, at the river Rohīni,&lt;!--210--&gt; or according to some sources, the Ganges;&lt;!--93--&gt; the Licchavis have also built a ''stūpa'' at their side of the river.&lt;!--210--&gt;{{sfn |Lamotte |1988 |pp=93, 210}} The Chinese pilgrim [[Xuan Zang]] (602{{en dash}}64 CE) later visits ''stūpas'' on both sides of the river Rohīni.&lt;ref name="Sarao" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Higham" /&gt; Faxian also reports having visited ''stūpas'' dedicated to Ānanda at the river Rohīni,{{sfn |Lamotte |1988 |p=210}} but also in Mathurā.{{sfn |Jaini |2001 |page=361}}&lt;ref name="Vogel" /&gt; Moreover, according to the Mūlasarvāstivāda version of the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Saṃyukta Āgama]], King Aśoka visits and makes the most lavish [[offering (Buddhism)|offerings]] he ever made to a ''stūpa''.{{Quote box

In Early Buddhist Texts, Ānanda has reached final Nirvana and will no longer be reborn. But, in contrast with the early texts, according to the Mahāyāna [[Lotus Sutra|Lotus Sūtra]], Ānanda will be born as a Buddha in the future. He will accomplish this slower than the present Buddha, [[Gotama Buddha]], has accomplished this, because Ānanda aspires to becoming a Buddha by applying "great learning". Because of this long trajectory and great efforts, however, his enlightenment will be extraordinary and with great splendor.{{sfn |Witanachchi |1965 |p=535}}

Ānanda is depicted as an eloquent speaker,&lt;ref name="Bodhi" /&gt; who often teaches about the self and about meditation.{{sfn |Findly |2003 |p=381}} There are numerous Buddhist texts attributed to Ānanda, including the ''Atthakanāgara Sutta'', about meditation methods to attain Nirvana; a version of the ''[[Bhaddekaratta Sutta]]'' ({{lang-sa |Bhadrakārātrī|italic=yes |link=no}}, {{zh |p=shanye}}), about living in the present moment;{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Atthakanāgarasutta; Bhaddekarattasutta}}{{sfn |Norman |1983 |page=48}} the ''Sekha Sutta'', about the higher training of a disciple of the Buddha; the ''Subha Suttanta'', about the practices the Buddha inspired others to follow.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Sekhasutta; Subhasuttanta}} In the ''Gopaka-Mogallānasutta'', a conversation takes place between Ānanda, the brahmin Gopaka-Mogallāna and the minister Vassakara, the latter being the highest official of the [[Magadha]] region.{{sfn |Clasquin |2013 |page=10}}{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |p=153}} During this conversation, which occurs shortly after the Buddha's death,&lt;!--10--&gt; Vassakara asks whether it is decided yet who will succeed the Buddha.

Because Ānanda was instrumental in founding the ''bhikkhunī'' community, he has been honored by ''bhikkhunīs'' for this throughout Buddhist history. The earliest traces of this can be found in the writings of the Chinese pilgrim monks Faxian and Xuan Zang,{{sfn |Ambros |2016 |page=209}}&lt;ref name="Mohr"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor1-last=Mohr |editor1-first=Thea |editor2-last=Tsedroen |editor2-first=Jampa |encyclopedia=Dignity and Discipline: Reviving Full Ordination for Buddhist Nuns |date=2014 |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] |isbn=978-0-86171-830-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qy8qAwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; who reported that ''bhikkhunīs'' made offerings to a ''stūpa'' in Ānanda's honor during celebrations and [[uposatha|observance days]].&lt;!--210--&gt; On a similar note, in 5th{{en dash}}6th-century China&lt;!--211--&gt; and 10th-century Japan, Buddhist texts were composed recommending women to uphold the semi-monastic [[eight precepts]] in honor and gratitude of Ānanda.&lt;!--212--&gt; In Japan, this was through the format of a penance ritual called ''keka'' ({{lang-zh|悔過}}).&lt;!--214--&gt; By the 13th century, a cult-like interest for Ānanda had developed in a number of convents,&lt;!--217-8--&gt; which included images,&lt;!--216--&gt; ''stūpas''&lt;!--216-7--&gt; and ceremonies in his honor.&lt;!--217-8--&gt; Presently, opinions among scholars are divided as to whether Ānanda's cult among ''bhikkhunīs''  was an expression of their dependence on male monastic tradition, or the opposite, an expression of their legitimacy and independence.&lt;!--245-6--&gt;{{sfn |Ambros |2016 |pages=210{{en dash}}12, 214, 216{{en dash}}8, 245{{en dash}}6}}

Pāli Vinaya texts attribute the design of the Buddhist [[civara|monk's robe]] to Ānanda. As Buddhism prospers, more laypeople start to donate expensive cloth for robes, which puts the monks at risk for theft. To decrease its commercial value, monks therefore cut up the cloth offered, before they sow a robe from it. The Buddha asks Ānanda to think of a model for a Buddhist robe, made from small pieces of cloth. Ānanda designs a standard robe model, based on the rice fields of Magadha, which are divided in sections by banks of earth.{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |p=36}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/aa/aananda.htm Ānanda]}} Another tradition that is connected to Ānanda is ''[[paritta]]'' recitation. Theravāda Buddhists explain that the custom of sprinkling water during ''paritta'' chanting originates in Ānanda's visit to Vesālī, when he recites the ''Ratana Sutta'' and sprinkles water from his alms bowl.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Ratanasutta}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gombrich |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard Gombrich |title=Buddhist Precept and Practice: Traditional Buddhism in the Rural Highlands of Ceylon |date=1995 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-7103-0444-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=V3Z-dHpBsBsC |page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third tradition sometimes attributed to Ānanda is the use of [[Bodhi tree]]s in Buddhism. It is described in the text ''[[Jataka|Kāliṅgabodhi Jātaka]]'' that Ānanda plants a Bodhi tree as a symbol of the Buddha's enlightenment, to give people the chance to pay their respects to the Buddha.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/aa/aananda.htm Ānanda]}}&lt;ref name="Gutman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gutman |first1=Pamela |last2=Hudson |first2=Bob |title=A First-Century Stele from Sriksetra |journal=[[Ecole française d'Extrême-Orient|Bulletin de l'Ecole française d'Extrême-Orient]] |date=2012 |volume=99 |issue=1 |page=29 |doi=10.3406/befeo.2012.6151 |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/befeo_0336-1519_2012_num_99_1_6151}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tree and shrine came to be known as the [[Ānanda Bodhi Tree]],{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/aa/aananda.htm Ānanda]}} said to have grown from a seed from the original Bodhi Tree under which the Buddha is depicted to have attained enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Svasti" /&gt; Many of this type of Bodhi Tree shrines in Southeast Asia were erected following this example.&lt;ref name="Gutman" /&gt; Presently, the Ānanda Bodhi Tree is sometimes identified with a tree at the ruins of [[Jetavana]], Sāvatthi, based on the records of the Chinese pilgrim [[Faxian]] (337{{en dash}}422 CE).&lt;ref name="Svasti"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Svasti |first1=Pichaya |title=The Path to Nirvana |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/travel/tourists-and-expats/1243338/the-path-to-nirvana |archive-url=http://archive.is/bftsY |archive-date=2 October 2018 |dead-url=no |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=[[Bangkok Post]] |date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conclusion, Ānanda is one of the most loved figures in Buddhism. Although he is not as wise as some of the other main disciples, he is beloved because of his devotion to the Buddha and sincere efforts to understand and disseminate the Buddha's teachings.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Ānanda}}

Between 1856 and 1858 [[Richard Wagner]] wrote a draft for an opera [[libretto]] based on the legend about Ānanda and the low-caste girl Prakṛti. He left only a fragmentary prose sketch of a work to be called ''[[Die Sieger]]'', but the topic inspired his later opera ''[[Parsifal (opera)|Parsifal]]''.&lt;ref name="Wagner" /&gt; Furthermore, the draft was used by composer [[Jonathan Harvey (composer)|Jonathan Harvey]] in his 2007 opera [[Wagner Dream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jonathan Harvey's Wagner Dream, Opera on 3{{nowrap| - }}BBC Radio 3 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01hdjz9 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107035632/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01hdjz9 |archive-date=7 November 2015 |dead-url=no |website=[[BBC]] |date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |App |2011 |pp=42{{en dash}}3}} In Wagner's version of the legend, which he based on orientalist [[Eugène Burnouf]]'s translations,&lt;!--43--&gt; the magical spell of Prakṛti's mother does not work on Ānanda, and Prakṛti turns to the Buddha to explain her desires for Ānanda. The Buddha replies that a union between Prakṛti and Ānanda is possible, but Prakṛti must agree to the Buddha's conditions. Prakṛti agrees, and it is revealed that the Buddha means something else than she does: he asks Prakṛti to ordain as a ''bhikkhunī'', and live the celibate life as a kind of sister to Ānanda. Although Prakṛti at first cries of misery, after the Buddha explains that her current situation is a result of [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]] from her previous life, she understands and rejoices in the life of a ''bhikkhunī''.{{sfn |App |2011 |pages=33{{en dash}}4, 43}} Apart from the spiritual themes, Wagner also addresses the faults of the caste system by having the Buddha criticize it.&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;{{cite journal |date=10 August 1889 |orig-year=1856 |journal=The Musical World |volume=69 |issue=32 |page=531 |title=Sketch of Wagner's 'Die Sieger' |first=R. |last=Wagner |author-link=Richard Wagner |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/3cbd37e266b00c7d |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001222537/https://search.proquest.com/openview/3cbd37e266b00c7d |dead-url=no |archive-date=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing from [[Schopenhauer]]'s philosophy, Wagner contrasts desire-driven salvation and true spiritual salvation: by seeking deliverance through the person she loves, Prakṛti only affirms her ''[[will to live]]'' ({{lang-de|Wille zum Leben|italic=yes}}), which is blocking her from attaining deliverance. By being ordained as a ''bhikkhunī'' she strives for her spiritual salvation instead. Thus, the early Buddhist account of Mahāpajāpati's ordination is replaced by that of Prakṛti. According to Wagner, by allowing Prakṛti to become ordained, the Buddha also completes his own aim in life: "[H]e regards his existence  in the world, whose aim was to benefit all beings, as completed, since he had become able to offer deliverance{{em dash}}without mediation{{em dash}}also to woman."{{sfn |App |2011 |pages=34{{en dash}}5 |ps=:"... und somit seine erlösenden, allen Wesen zugewendeten Weltlauf als volendet ansieht, da er auch dem Weibe{{em dash}}unmittelbar{{em dash}}die Erlösung zusprechen konnte."}}

The same legend of Ānanda and Prakṛti was made into a short prose play by the Indian poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], called ''Chandalika''. ''Chandalika'' deals with the themes of spiritual conflict, caste and social equality,&lt;!--Jain--&gt; and contains a strong critique of Indian society.&lt;!--Chowdurie--&gt; Just like in the traditional account, Prakṛti falls in love with Ānanda, after he gives her self-esteem by accepting a gift of water from her. Prakṛti's mother casts a spell to enchant Ānanda. In Tagore's play, however, Prakṛti later regrets what she has done and has the spell revoked.&lt;!--Jain--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jain |first=R. |year=2016 |title=Tagore's Drama Synthesis of Myths, Legends and Folklores: A Medium of Social Reformation |journal=Dialogue – A Journal Devoted to Literary Appreciation |volume=12 |issn=0974-5556 |issue=1 |url=http://dialoguethejournal.mripub.com/index.php/dailogue/article/view/39/39 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/72qzVmXXd |archive-date=2 October 2018 |dead-url=no |p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chowdurie |first1=Tapati |title=Quenching Prakriti’s Thirst... |url=https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/quenching-prakritis-thirst/article18261076.ece |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001222603/https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/quenching-prakritis-thirst/article18261076.ece |archive-date=1 October 2018 |dead-url=no |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
