'''Abraham Coles''' (December 26, 1813 – May 3, 1891) was an American physician, translator, author and poet from [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Coles, Abraham; Hunt, Ezra Mundy. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4zVtAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA54 ''Abraham Coles: Biographical Sketch, Memorial Tributes, Selections from His Works, (some Hitherto Unpublished.)''], p. 54. D. Appleton, 1892. Accessed October 1, 2015. "There was no more scholarly man in New Jersey than Dr. Abraham Coles, who was best known for his translations of the 'Dies Irae.' Although he practiced medicine in Newark, he made his home at Scotch Plains, N. J."&lt;/ref&gt; He published ''Dies Irae'' (1859), ''Stabat Mater Dolorosa'' (1865), ''Stabat Mater Speciosa'' (1866), ''Old Gems in New Settings'' (1866), ''The Microcosm'' (1866, 1881), ''The Evangel in Verse'' (1874) and ''The Light of the World'' (1884).&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Abraham_Coles Abraham Coles (1813–1891)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3317">'''Active stretching''' eliminates force and its adverse effects from stretching procedures.  Active stretching stimulates and prepares muscles for use during exercise.  Active stretches not only stretches the muscles and tissues, but prepares the muscles for the action by activating and warming them up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dr. Michael Yessis |title=Explosive Plyometrics |publisher=Ultimate Athlete Concepts|year=2009 |isbn=978-098171806-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before describing the principles on which active stretching is based, the terms [[agonist (muscle)|agonist]] and [[antagonist (muscle)|antagonist]] must be clarified. Agonist refers to actively contracting muscle or muscles while their opposing muscles are termed antagonists.

The neuromechanisms conceptualized by [[Sir Charles Sherrington]] (1857 - 1956), “the philosopher of the nervous system”, as applied to active stretching are:

#Reciprocal inhibition — While agonist muscles contract, contraction of the opposing antagonist muscles is inhibited.  (Such as when alternately flexing and extending one's elbow.)
#[[Muscle spindles]] — Sensory nerve endings in muscle detect the change in length of the muscle and its rate of change.

Force applied to a muscle stimulates the muscle spindles which activate protective reflexes resulting in contraction of that muscle. (Such as the knee jerk response of neurological testing procedures.)

While necessary for sports and ordinary motions, this protective reaction is counterproductive for stretching, i.e., lengthening muscles.

==A history of active stretching==

#Sir Charles Sherrington conceptualized the principle of reciprocal innervation circa 1904 and demonstrated it circa 1913.
#A. D. Munrow's work proposed these principles for ‘active’ mobilizing exercises. 1962
#While H. A. DeVries, L. E. Holt and others wandered from this course, P. Williams (1937) utilized procedures for his flexion exercises back program. [http://www.sportskinetics.com Peters and Peters] (1975) further adapted Sherrington's principles into their program of ‘active stretching’, departing from the popular static stretching designed for specific sports, to address mobility of the entire body.
#EMG (Electromyographic) studies by S. Blackburn and others have validated Sherrington's principle of reciprocal innervation. Audiovisual electromyography by Peters and Peters supports Sherrington's  principle of reciprocal innervation (inhibition) and his description of the reaction of ‘muscle spindles’ to force. These two principles are the basis of ‘active stretching’ procedures.
#There currently are other stretching methods utilizing ‘active’ components in conjunction with force, the use of which Munrow does not concur.

'''Advance care planning''' is a process that enables individuals to make plans about their future [[healthcare|health care]].  Advance care plans provide direction to healthcare professionals  when a person is not in a position to  either make and/or communicate their own healthcare choices. Advance care planning is applicable to [[Adult#Legal adulthood|adults]] at all stages of life.&lt;ref name="Framework"&gt;{{cite web | title = A National Framework for Advance Care Directives | publisher = Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council | date = September 2011 | url = http://www.ahmac.gov.au/cms_documents/AdvanceCareDirectives2011.pdf | accessdate = 17 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation in advance care planning has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety for patients and their families, and lead to improvements in end of life care.&lt;ref name="Detering"&gt;{{Cite journal

The main components of advance care planning include the nomination of a [[substitute decision maker]], and the completion of an [[advance health care directive|advance care directive]].

==Background==
Advance care planning is applicable to all [[Adult#Legal adulthood|adults]] in all stages of life.&lt;ref name=Framework /&gt; Advance care planning aims to allow people to live well, and when death approaches, die in accordance with their personal values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Respecting Patient Choices | publisher = Advance Care Planning Australia | url = http://advancecareplanning.org.au/advance-care-planning/for-everyone/respecting-patient-choices/ | accessdate = 18 December 2013 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140126230831/http://advancecareplanning.org.au/advance-care-planning/for-everyone/respecting-patient-choices/| dead-url = yes | archivedate =2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advance care planning is only applicable when the individual cannot make and/or communicate decisions about what they want in relation to their healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Competence and Capacity | publisher = Advance Care Planning Australia | url = http://advancecareplanning.org.au/advance-care-planning/for-professionals/competence-and-capacity/ | accessdate = 18 December 2013 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140126230946/http://advancecareplanning.org.au/advance-care-planning/for-professionals/competence-and-capacity/| dead-url = yes | archivedate =2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; If advance care planning has occurred, patients who have lost capacity or the ability to communicate or both, are able to continue to have a say in their medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The benefits of advance care planning | publisher = Advance Care Planning Australia | url = http://advancecareplanning.org.au/advance-care-planning/for-everyone/the-benefits-of-advance-care-planning/ | format = | doi = | accessdate = 16 December 2013

While applicable to all stages of life, it is particularly applicable to [[end-of-life care]] decision making, since approximately 1 in 4 people lose decision making capacity when approaching the end of their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

People can also express their preferences through written advance directives or by advising their appointed substitute decision maker about their wishes for when they are unable to make or communicate these decisions/wishes themselves.

==Components==
There are two methods by which the communication of an individual's preferences can be known. These are:
# the appointment of a substitute decision maker, and
# the completion of an advance care directive or similar document.

===Substitute decision maker===
{{Main|Surrogate decision-maker}}

A [[substitute decision maker]] makes decisions on behalf of an individual only when that individual does not have the [[legal capacity|capacity]] to make/communicate decisions for themselves.&lt;ref name=choosing&gt;{{cite web | title = Choosing someone to speak for you | publisher = Advance Care Planning Australia | url = http://advancecareplanning.org.au/advance-care-planning/create-a-care-plan/choosing-someone-to-speak-for-you/ | accessdate = 18 December 2013 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140126231016/http://advancecareplanning.org.au/advance-care-planning/create-a-care-plan/choosing-someone-to-speak-for-you/| dead-url = yes | archivedate =2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of methods by which a substitute decision maker can be identified. The ideal method is the appointment of a person using a statutory document. In the absence of a [[statute|statutory]] document the substitute decision maker may be a "person responsible" as listed in order of authority in legislation.&lt;ref name=choosing /&gt;

A substitute decision maker can be chosen by an individual following completion of relevant paperwork, can be assigned to the person by law in the absence of a chosen substitute decision maker (e.g. family member or [[carer]]), or can be appointed for the person (e.g. [[legal guardian|guardian]] appointed by a guardianship tribunal)
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Substitute Decision Maker | publisher = Advance Care Planning Australia | url = http://advancecareplanning.org.au/advance-care-planning/for-professionals/substitute-decision-maker/ | accessdate = 18 December 2013 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140126230950/http://advancecareplanning.org.au/advance-care-planning/for-professionals/substitute-decision-maker/| dead-url = yes | archivedate =2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substitute decision makers make decisions based on the principles of either [[substituted judgement]] or [[surrogate decision-maker#best interests standard|best interests]].&lt;ref name=Framework /&gt; Substituted judgement is when the substitute decision maker arrives at a decision based on the best approximation of what they believe the person would want. This decision should be informed by both the known wishes of the person and the best available healthcare advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Best interests decision making requires the substitute decision maker to focus on the patient's best interests.

Many, but not all, jurisdictions have legislation supporting the appointment of a substitute decision maker through a [[statute|statutory]] document. They have different names depending on the jurisdiction:

===Advance care directives===
{{Main|Advance health care directive}}

An [[advance care directive]] is a document detailing an individual's health care preferences. This may include personal values and life goals, describe circumstances the person would find unacceptable, identify preferences relating to specific medical interventions, or a combination of these.&lt;ref name=Framework /&gt;

Advance care directives may be written on specifically designed forms, but can also take the form of a written letter or statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusion of a doctor in the completion of an advance care directive will assist in ensuring that an individual's wishes are clear and written in a manner that is easy for substitute decision makers and/or medical staff to interpret and follow them in the future. Having a [[physician]] witness the document will reinforce this by showing future medical staff that the document contains information about informed decisions due to the assistance of a physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An '''advance healthcare directive''', also known as '''living will''', '''personal directive''', '''advance directive''', '''medical directive''' or '''advance decision''', is a legal document in which a person specifies what actions should be taken for their health if they are no longer able to make decisions for themselves because of illness or incapacity. In the U.S. it has a legal status in itself, whereas in some countries it is legally persuasive without being a legal document.

A living will is one form of advance directive, leaving instructions for treatment. Another form is a specific type of [[power of attorney]] or [[health care proxy]], in which the person authorizes someone (an agent) to make decisions on their behalf when they are incapacitated. People are often encouraged to complete both documents to provide comprehensive guidance regarding their care, although they may be combined into a single form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How a Power of Attorney Works|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/estate_planning/power_of_attorney.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|publisher=ExpertLaw|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of combination documents includes the [[Five Wishes]] in the United States. The term ''living will'' is also the commonly recognised vernacular in many countries, especially the U.K.&lt;ref&gt;Docker, C. ''Advance Directives/Living Wills'' in: McLean S.A.M., "Contemporary Issues in Law, Medicine and Ethics," Dartmouth 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Living will==
[[Image:Refusal of treatment form.jpg|thumb|left|Refusal of treatment form]]
The living will is the oldest form of advance directive. It was first proposed by an Illinois attorney, [[Luis Kutner]], in a law journal in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kutner|first1=Luis|title=Due Process of Euthanasia: The Living Will, a Proposal|journal=Indiana Law Journal|date=1969|volume=44|issue=4|pages=534–554|url=https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/ilj/vol44/iss4/2/|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kutner drew from existing estate law, by which an individual can control property affairs after death (i.e., when no longer available to speak for himself or herself) and devised a way for an individual to express his or her health care desires when no longer able to express current healthcare wishes. Because this form of "will" was to be used while an individual was still alive (but no longer able to make decisions) it was dubbed the "living will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Alexander G.J. | year = 1991 | title = Time for a new law on health care advance directives | url = | journal = Hastings Center Law Journal | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 755–778 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., The [[Patient Self-Determination Act]] (PSDA)&lt;ref&gt;Patient Self-Determination Act U.S.C.A. 1395cc &amp; 1396a, 4206-4207, 4751, Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, P.L:.b 101-508 (101ST Cong. 2nd Sess. Nov. 5, 1990) (West Supp., 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; went into effect in December 1991, and required healthcare providers (primarily hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies) to give patients information about their rights to make advance directives under state law.&lt;ref&gt;Docker, C. Advance Directives/Living Wills in: McLean S.A.M., Contemporary Issues in Law, Medicine and Ethics," Dartmouth 1996:182.&lt;/ref&gt;

A living will usually provides specific directives about the course of treatment healthcare providers and caregivers are to follow. In some cases a living will may forbid the use of various kinds of burdensome medical treatment. It may also be used to express wishes about the use or foregoing of food and water, if supplied via tubes or other medical devices. The living will is used only if the individual has become unable to give informed consent or refusal due to incapacity. A living will can be very specific or very general. An example of a statement sometimes found in a living will is: "If I suffer an incurable, irreversible illness, disease, or condition and my attending physician determines that my condition is terminal, I direct that life-sustaining measures that would serve only to prolong my dying be withheld or discontinued."

More specific living wills may include information regarding an individual's desire for such services such as analgesia (pain relief), antibiotics, hydration, feeding, and the use of ventilators or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, studies have also shown that adults are more likely to complete these documents if they are written in everyday language and less focused on technical treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tokar |first=Steve |url=http://pub.ucsf.edu/today/cache/feature/200710312.html |title=Patients Prefer Simplified Advance Directive over Standard Form - UCSF Today |publisher=Pub.ucsf.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207185025/http://pub.ucsf.edu/today/cache/feature/200710312.html |archivedate=2009-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by the late 1980s, public advocacy groups became aware that many people remained unaware of advance directives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Damato AN | year = 1993 | title = Advance Directives for the Elderly: A Survey | url = | journal = New Jersey Medicine | volume = 90 | issue = 3| pages = 215–220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and even fewer actually completed them.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, J. Your aging parents: document their wishes. ''American Health.'' May 1995. pp. 58-61, 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cugliari A, Miller T, Sobal J | year = 1995 | title = Factors promoting completion of advance directives in the hospital | doi = 10.1001/archinte.155.17.1893 | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 155 | issue = 9| pages = 1893–1898 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this was seen as a failure of health care providers and medical organizations to promote and support the use of these documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Johnston SC | year = 1995 | title = The discussion about advance directives: patient and physician opinions regarding when and how it should be conducted | url = | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 155 | issue = | pages = 1025–1030 | doi=10.1001/archinte.155.10.1025|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public’s response was to press for further legislative support. The most recent result was the Patient Self-Determination Act of 1990,&lt;ref&gt;''Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1990'' [including amendments commonly known as The Patient Self-Determination Act]. Sections 4206 and 4751, P.L. 101-508. Introduced as S. 1766 by Senators Danforth and Moynihan, and HR 5067 by Congressman Sander Levin. Signed by the President on November 5, 1990; effective beginning December 1, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; which attempted to address this awareness problem by requiring health care institutions to better promote and support the use of advance directives.&lt;ref name="American Bar Association 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1990''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Living wills proved to be very popular, and by 2007, 41% of Americans had completed a living will.&lt;ref&gt;Charmaine Jones, With living wills gaining in popularity, push grows for more extensive directive, ''Crain's Cleveland Business,'' August 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to public needs, state legislatures soon passed laws in support of living wills in virtually every state in the union.&lt;ref name="American Bar Association 1991"&gt;American Bar Association. ''Patient Self-Determination Act: State Law Guide.'' American Bar Association Commission on Legal Problems of The Elder. August 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as living wills began to be better recognized, key deficits were soon discovered. Most living wills tended to be limited in scope&lt;ref name="Annas, GJ 1210"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Annas GJ | year = 1991 | title = The Health Care Proxy and the Living Will | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 324 | issue = 17| pages = 1210–1213 | doi=10.1056/nejm199104253241711}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often failed to fully address presenting problems and needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hashimoto DM | year = 1983 | title = A structural analysis of the physician-patient relationship in no-code decision-making | url = | journal = Yale Law Journal | volume = 93 | issue = | page = 361 | doi=10.2307/796311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hastings Center. ''Guidelines on the Termination of Life-Sustaining Treatment and the Care of the Dying: a report by the Hastings Center.'' [[Briarcliff Manor, NY]]: Indiana University Press. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, many individuals wrote out their wishes in ways that might conflict with quality medical practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Campbell ML | year = 1995 | title = Interpretation of an ambiguous advance directive | url = | journal = Dimensions of Critical Care Nursing | volume = 14 | issue = 5| pages = 226–235 | doi=10.1097/00003465-199509000-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, it was determined that a living will alone might be insufficient to address many important health care decisions. This led to the development of what some have called "second generation" advance directives&lt;ref name="Annas, GJ 1210"/&gt; – the "health care proxy appointment" or "medical power of attorney."

Living wills also reflect a moment in time, and may therefore need regular updating to ensure that the correct course of action can be chosen.

==Durable power of attorney and healthcare proxy==
{{Main|Health care proxy|Power of attorney}}

===Second generation advance directives===
As before, the next generation advance directive was drawn from existing law – specifically from business law. Power of attorney statutes have existed in the United States since the days of "[[common law]]" (i.e., laws brought from England to the United States during the colonial period).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/common%20law |title=Common law &amp;#124; Define Common law at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early powers of attorney allowed an individual to name someone to act in their stead. Drawing upon these laws, "durable powers of attorney for health care" and "healthcare proxy appointment" documents were created and codified in law, allowing an individual to appoint someone to make healthcare decisions in their behalf if they should ever be rendered incapable of making their wishes known.&lt;ref name="AmericanBarAsso.1991"&gt;American Bar Association. ''Patient Self-Determination Act: State Law Guide.'' American Bar Association Commission on Legal Problems of the Elderly. August 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The appointed healthcare proxy has, in essence, the same rights to request or refuse treatment that the individual would have if still capable of making and communicating health care decisions.&lt;ref name="AmericanBarAsso.1991"/&gt;
The primary benefit of second-generation advance directives is that the appointed representative can make real-time decisions in actual circumstances, as opposed to advance decisions framed in hypothetical situations, as recorded in a living will. This new advance directive was heartily endorsed by the U.S. public, and supporting legislation soon followed in virtually all states.&lt;ref name="AmericanBarAsso.1991"/&gt;

Eventually, however, deficiencies in "second-generation" advance directives were also soon noted. Primarily, individuals faced problems similar to those that handicapped living wills – knowing what to tell the proxy decision-maker about one's wishes in a meaningful way. Studies found most of what appointed proxies are told is too vague for meaningful interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cohen-Mansfield J | year = 1991 | title = The decision to execute a durable power of attorney for health care and preferences regarding the utilization of life-sustaining treatments in nursing home residents | url = | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 151 | issue = | pages = 289–294 | doi=10.1001/archinte.151.2.289|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emanuel LL, Emanuel EJ 1993 6–14"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Emanuel LL, Emanuel EJ | year = 1993 | title = Decisions at the end of life: guided by communities of patients | url = | journal = Hastings Center Report | volume = 23 | issue = 5| pages = 6–14 | doi=10.2307/3562059}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Emanuel LL, Emanuel EJ | year = 1993 | title = Advance directives: what have we learned so far? | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Ethics | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 8–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = High , Turner HB | year = 1987 | title = Surrogate decision-making: the elderly's familial expectations | url = | journal = Theoretical Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 303–320 | doi=10.1007/bf00489466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = High DM | year = 1988 | title = All in the family: extended autonomy and expectations in surrogate health care decision-making | url = | journal = Gerontologist | volume = 28 | issue = Suppl| pages = S46–S51 | doi=10.1093/geront/28.suppl.46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of meaningful information, family and physician "guesswork" is found to be inaccurate as much as 76% of the time.&lt;ref name="Emanuel LL, Emanuel EJ 1993 6–14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Diamond E | year = 1989 | title = Decision-making ability and advance directive preferences in nursing home patients and proxies | url = | journal = Gerontologist | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 622–26 | doi=10.1093/geront/29.5.622|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hare J | year = 1992 | title = Agreement between patients and their self-selected surrogates on difficult medical decisions | url = | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 152 | issue = 5| pages = 1049–54 | doi=10.1001/archinte.1992.00400170123023|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ouslander, J et al.

===Third generation advance directives===

Third generation advance directives were designed to contain enriched content to assist individuals and their appointed agents, families, and physicians to better understand and honor their wishes. The first of the third-generation advance directives was the Values History by [[David John Doukas|Doukas]] and McCullough, created at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, first published in 1988, and then more widely cited in an article in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[[David John Doukas|Doukas DJ]], McCullough LB, "Assessing the Values History of the Aged Patient Regarding Critical and Chronic Care," in The Handbook of Geriatric Assessment. Eds. Gallo JJ, Reichel W, Andersen LM, Rockville, MD: Aspen Press, 1988:111-124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doukas DJ, McCullough LB | author-link = David John Doukas | year = 1991 | title = The values history: the evaluation of the patient's values and advance directives | url = | journal = Journal of Family Practice | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 145–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Values History is a "two-part advance directive instrument that elicits patient values about terminal medical care and therapy-specific directives." The goal of this advance directive is to move away from a focus on specific treatments and medical procedures to a focus on patient values and personal goals.

The next widely recognized third generation advance directive is the Medical Directive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Emanuel LL, Emanuel E | year = 1989 | title = The medical directive: A new comprehensive advance care document | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 261 | issue = 22| pages = 3288–93 | doi=10.1001/jama.261.22.3288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sachs GA, Cassell CK | year = 1990 | title = The medical directive | doi= 10.1001/jama.267.16.2229 | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 267 | issue = 16| pages = 2229–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; created by Emanuel and Emanuel of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. It is a six-page document that provides six case scenarios for advance medical decision-making. The scenarios are each associated with a roster of commonly considered medical procedures and interventions, allowing the individual to decide in advance which treatments are wanted or not wanted under the circumstances. Several criticisms regarding this advance directive have been expressed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brett AS | year = 1991 | title = Limitations of listing specific medical interventions in advance directives | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 266 | issue = | pages = 825–28 | doi=10.1001/jama.266.6.825}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Silverman, H 1031"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Silverman H, Vinicky J, Gasner M | year = 1992 | title = Advance directives: implications for critical care | url = | journal = Critical Care Medicine | volume = 20 | issue = 7| pages = 1027–1031 | doi=10.1097/00003246-199207000-00021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily, it prompts individuals to make medical treatment decisions, which they are typically not equipped to make.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Perhaps the best known third-generation advance directive is the [[Five Wishes]] directive.&lt;ref name="agingwithdignity.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agingwithdignity.org/5wishes.html |title=Aging With Dignity Five Wishes |publisher=Agingwithdignity.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509150846/http://www.agingwithdignity.org/5wishes.html |archivedate=2009-05-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This document was developed in collaboration with multiple experts with funding from the Robert Wood Johnson foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rwjf.org/ |title=The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation: Health and Health Care Improvement |publisher=RWJF |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100622180926/http://www.rwjf.org/| archivedate= 22 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is distributed by the organization [[Aging with Dignity]].

The most recent third-generation advance directive is the Lifecare Advance Directive.&lt;ref name="LifecarePublications.2008"&gt;''Strengthening Advance Directives: Overcoming Past Limitations Through
Enhanced Theory, Design, and Application''. Lifecare Publications. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In creating this document, researchers reviewed more than 6,500 articles from medical, legal, sociological, and theological sources. The conclusion was that advance directives needed to be based more on "health outcome states" than on rosters of medical treatments and legal jargon. Building upon the insights gleaned from the literature review, an advance directive document created, tested in a study involving nearly 1,000 participants, and then comparison tested against other popular advance directive forms. The results indicated greater patient/proxy decision-making accuracy, and superior comprehensive content as compared with other documents tested.&lt;ref name="LifecarePublications.2008"/&gt; The primary criticism has been that it is very lengthy and tedious to complete.

==Legal situation by country==
Note: Some of the countries listed below are in the European Union, where legal systems may vary considerably from those in the U.S. ''Country reports on advance directives''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethik.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:00000000-14d5-886d-ffff-fffff1488f30/Country_Reports_AD.pdf |title=Country reports on advance directives, 100 pages |publisher=University of Zurich |date= |accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 2008 paper summarizing advance health care legislation in the European Union with a shorter summary for the U.S.; a 2009 paper also provides a European overview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/457880/Advance_Health_Care_Directives_Towards_a_Coordinated_European_Policy_with_N._Biller-Andorno_and_S._Brauer |title= Advance Health Care Directives: Towards a Coordinated European Policy?|website=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The laws regarding advance directives, powers of attorney, and enduring guardianships vary from state to state. In Queensland, for example, the concept of an advance health directive is defined in the ''[[Power of attorney|Powers of attorney]] act of 1998'' and ''Guardianship and Administration act of 2000''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Rothschild |first1= Alan |editor1-first= Dieter |editor1-last= Birnbacher |editor2-first= Edgar |editor2-last= Dahl |title= Giving Death a Helping Hand: Physician-Assisted Suicide and Public Policy.

===Canada===
[[Health Canada]] – [[Canada]]'s federal health agency – has acknowledged the need for a greater investment in [[Palliative care|palliative]] and [[hospice]] care as the country faces a rapidly growing population of elderly and terminally ill citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/minist/speeches-discours/_2014/2014_03_06-eng.php |title=Health Canada- Minister's speeches |publisher=Health Canada.ca |date=2014-02-06 |accessdate=2014-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129081757/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/minist/speeches-discours/_2014/2014_03_06-eng.php |archivedate=2014-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the current focus in Canada is on [[advance care planning]] which involves encouraging individuals to reflect on and express their wishes for future care, including end-of-life care, before they become terminally ill or incapable of making decisions for themselves. A
number of publicly funded initiatives exist to promote advance care planning and to encourage people to appoint "[[Surrogate decision-maker|substitute decision makers]]" who make medical decisions and can give or withhold consent for medical procedures according to the patient's
pre-expressed wishes when the patient becomes incapable of doing so themselves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chpca.net/about-us.aspx |title=Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association |publisher= CHPCA.net |date=2014 |accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpcintegration.ca/about-us.aspx |title=The Way Forward |publisher= HPC integration.ca |date=2014 |accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecarenet.ca/about-us |title=The CARENET |publisher= The CARENET.ca |date=2014 |accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pallium.ca/about-us/ |title=Pallium Canada |publisher= Pallium.ca |date=2014 |accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, The Advance Care Planning in Canada: A National Framework and Implementation Project was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advancecareplanning.ca/about-advance-care-planning/national-framework-for-acp.aspx |title=National Framework for advance care planning |publisher=SpeakUp |date=2014 |accessdate=2014-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128195532/http://www.advancecareplanning.ca/about-advance-care-planning/national-framework-for-acp.aspx |archivedate=2014-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to engage healthcare professionals and educate patients
about the importance of advance care planning and [[End-of-life care|end of life care]].

Polling indicates that 96% of Canadians think that having a conversation with a loved one about planning for the end of life is important. However, the same polls show that only about 13% have actually done so, or have created an advance care plan for themselves.

End-of-life issues in Canada have recently been highlighted due to the ongoing related debate about [[Euthanasia in Canada|Physician assisted death in Canada]]. Former Federal Health Minister Rona Ambrose (July 15, 2013 to November 4, 2015) has stated: "I think the starting point for me is that we still don't have the best elderly care and palliative care yet… So let's talk about making sure we have the best end-of-life care before we start talking about assisted suicide and euthanasia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rona-ambrose-says-canada-needs-better-palliative-care-1.2764813 |title=Rona Ambrose says Canada needs better palliative care |publisher= CBC |date=2014-09-15 |accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===England and Wales===
In [[England and Wales]], people may make an advance directive or appoint a [[healthcare proxy#UK legal situation|proxy]] under the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]]. This is only for an advance refusal of treatment for when the person lacks mental capacity; to be legally binding, the advance decision must be specific about the treatment that is being refused and the circumstances in which the refusal will apply. To be valid, the person must have been competent and understood the decision when they signed the directive. Where the patient's advance decision relates to a refusal of life-prolonging treatment this must be recorded in writing and witnessed. Any advance refusal is legally binding providing that the patient is an adult, the patient was competent and properly informed when reaching the decision, it is clearly applicable to the present circumstances and there is no reason to believe that the patient has changed his or her mind. If an advance decision does not meet these criteria but appears to set out a clear indication of the patient's wishes, it will not be legally binding but should be taken into consideration in determining the patient's best interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bma.org.uk/-/media/files/pdfs/practical%20advice%20at%20work/ethics/consenttoolkit_card9.pdf |format=PDF|title= BMA guidance|website=bma.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnston |first=Carolyn |author2=Liddle, Jane|year=2007|title=The Mental Capacity Act 2005: a new framework for healthcare decision making|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=33|issue= 2|pages=94–97|id= |url=http://jme.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/33/2/94|doi=10.1136/jme.2006.016972| pmid = 17264196 |pmc=2598235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010,  the Wealth Management Solicitors, Moore Blatch, announced that research showed demand for Living Wills had trebled in the two years previous, indicating the rising level of people concerned about the way in which their terminal illness will be managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=LONDON (June 10, 2010) |url=http://www.jlns.com/legal-wire/2010/06/10/demand-living-wills-trebles-last-two-years |title=Demand for Living Wills trebles in the last two years |publisher=JLNS |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2010-06-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100717033050/http://www.jlns.com/legal-wire/2010/06/10/demand-living-wills-trebles-last-two-years| archivedate= 17 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the British Government, every adult with mental capacity has the right to agree to or refuse medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;For the official guidance to doctors, see: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110809173247/http://www.gmc-uk.org/static/documents/content/End_of_life.pdf "Treatment and care towards the end of life: good practice in decision making"].

Retrieved 2011-01-05.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make their advance wishes clear, people can use a living will, which can include general statements about wishes, which are not legally binding, and specific refusals of treatment called "advance decisions" or "advance directives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/governmentcitizensandrights/death/preparation/dg_10029429 |title=How to make a living will : Directgov - Government, citizens and rights |publisher=Direct.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718011240/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/Death/Preparation/DG_10029429 |archivedate=2009-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
On 18 June 2009 the [[Bundestag]] passed a law on advance directives, applicable since 1 September 2009. Such law, based on the principle of the right of self-determination, provides for the assistance of a fiduciary and of the physician.

===Italy===
On 14 December 2017, [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Italian Senate]] officially approved a law on advance healthcare directive that came into force on 31 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:legge:2017-12-22;219|title=*** NORMATTIVA ***|author=|date=|website=www.normattiva.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proversi.it/discussioni/pro-contro/176-biotestamento| title=Biotestamento. Favorevole o contrario?|website=ProVersi.it|date=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy over end-of-life care emerged in Italy in 2006, when a terminally ill patient suffering from muscular dystrophy, Piergiorgio Welby, petitioned the courts for removal of his respirator. Debated in Parliament, no decision was reached. A doctor eventually honored Welby's wishes by removing the respirator under sedation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=Ian|title=Euthanasia Advocate in Italy Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/world/europe/22italycnd.html|accessdate=23 November 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=21 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physician was initially charged for violating Italy's laws against euthanasia, but was later cleared. Further debate ensued after the father of a 38-year-old woman, Eluana Englaro, petitioned the courts for permission to withdraw feeding tubes to allow her to die. Englaro had been in a coma for 17 years, following a car accident. After petitioning the courts for 10 years, authorization was granted and Englaro died in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Owen|first1=Richard|title=‘Right to die’ coma woman Eluana Englaro dies|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/right-to-die-coma-woman-eluana-englaro-dies-mlm26hzjgq5|accessdate=23 November 2017|publisher=The Times|date=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, apparently as a result of the recent Court of Cassation's holding in the case of Englaro, a guardianship judge in Modena, Italy used relatively new legislation&lt;ref&gt;Law No. 6 of January 9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; to work around the lack of the advance directive legislation. The new law permitted a judicially appointed guardian ("amministratore di sostegno") to make decisions for an individual. Faced with a 70-year-old woman with end-stage Lou Gehrig's Disease who was petitioning the court (with the support of her family) to prevent any later use of a respirator, the judge appointed her husband as guardian with the specific duty to refuse any tracheotomy and/or respirator use if/when the patient became unable to refuse such treatment herself.&lt;ref&gt;Decree of Dr. Guido Stanziani, Guardianship Judge of the Tribunal of Modena, 13 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]], patients and potential patients can specify the circumstances under which they would want [[euthanasia]] for themselves. They do this by providing a written [[euthanasia directive]]. This helps establish the previously expressed wish of the patient even if the patient is no longer able to communicate. However, it is only one of the factors that is taken into account. Apart from the will in writing of the patients, at least two physicians, the second being totally unrelated to the first physician in a professional matter (e.g. working in another hospital, no prior knowledge of the medical case at hand), have to agree that the patient is terminally ill and that no hope for recovery exists. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Switzerland===
In [[Switzerland]], there are several organizations which take care of registering [[patient decree]]s, forms which are signed by the patients declaring that in case of permanent loss of judgement (e.g., inability to communicate or severe brain damage) all means of prolonging life shall be stopped. Family members and these organizations also keep proxies which entitle their holder to enforce such patient decrees. Establishing such decrees is relatively uncomplicated.

However, in Switzerland, a patient decree has, as of November 2008, no legally binding effects, whether concerning civil or criminal aspects. Such a decree is today merely viewed as representing the supposed will of the person with the incapability. There is, however, a revision of the [[Swiss Civil Code]] under way that aims to change this situation (intended to be article 360 of the Swiss Civil Code) by making the patient decree a legally binding document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/ejpd/en/home/themen/gesellschaft/ref_gesetzgebung/ref_vormundschaft.html |title=Site of the Swiss government on the intended new law |publisher=Ejpd.admin.ch |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607073634/http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/ejpd/en/home/themen/gesellschaft/ref_gesetzgebung/ref_vormundschaft.html |archivedate=2010-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cost burdens to individuals and families are considerable.  A national study found that: “In 20% of cases, a family member had to quit work;” 31% lost “all or most savings” (even though 96% had insurance); and “20% reported loss of [their] major source of income.”&lt;ref&gt;Covinsky, KE; Goldman, L; Cook, EF; etal.

As more and more Americans experienced the burdens and diminishing benefits of invasive and aggressive medical treatment in poor prognosis states – either directly (themselves) or through a loved one – pressure began to mount to devise ways to avoid the suffering and costs associated with treatments one did not want in personally untenable situations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  The first formal response was the living will.

In the United States, all states recognize some form of living wills or the designation of a [[health care proxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Living Wills, Health Care Proxies, &amp; Advance Health Care Directives|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/real_property_trust_estate/resources/estate_planning/living_wills_health_care_proxies_advance_health_care_directives.html|website=ABA|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''living will'' is not officially recognized under California law, but an advance health care directive or durable power of attorney may be used for the same purpose as a living will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do I Need a Will?|url=http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Public/Free-Legal-Information/Legal-Guides/Do-I-Need-a-Will|website=State Bar of California|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "report card" issued by the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] in 2002 concluded that only seven states deserved an "A" for meeting the standards of the model [[Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Means to a Better End: A Report on Dying in America Today|url=http://www.rwjf.org/files/publications/other/meansbetterend.pdf|website=Robert Wood Johnson Foundation|accessdate=23 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907021249/http://www.rwjf.org/files/publications/other/meansbetterend.pdf|archivedate=7 September 2008|date=November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys show that one-third of Americans say they have had to make decisions about end-of-life care for a loved one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One-third of Americans say they've had to make a decision about whether to keep a loved one alive using extraordinary means|url=http://www.publicagenda.org/charts/one-third-americans-say-theyve-had-make-decision-about-whether-keep-loved-one-alive-using-extraordinary-means|website=Public Agenda|accessdate=17 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427005929/http://www.publicagenda.org/charts/one-third-americans-say-theyve-had-make-decision-about-whether-keep-loved-one-alive-using-extraordinary-means|archivedate=27 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Pennsylvania on November 30, 2006, Governor Edward Rendell signed into law Act 169, that provides a comprehensive statutory framework governing advance health care directives and health care decision-making for incompetent patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pamedsoc.org/MainMenuCategories/Government/LawsAffectingPhysicians/AdvanceDirectives/Act169facts.aspx |title=Facts on Act 169 (Advance Directives) - Pennsylvania Medical Society |publisher=Pamedsoc.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507102752/http://www.pamedsoc.org/MainMenuCategories/Government/LawsAffectingPhysicians/AdvanceDirectives/Act169facts.aspx |archivedate=2011-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, health care organizations make available a "Combined Living Will &amp; Health Care Power of Attorney Example Form from Pennsylvania Act 169 of 2006."

Several states offer living will "registries" where citizens can file their living will so that they are more easily and readily accessible by doctors and other health care providers. However, in recent years some of these registries, such as the one run by the Washington State Department of Health, have been shuttered by the state government because of low enrollment, lack of funds, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Washington state ends living will registry |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2015478485_apwalivingwillregistry.html |accessdate=2011-07-24 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=July 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927115714/http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2015478485_apwalivingwillregistry.html |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 28, 2009, [[Barack Obama]] became the first United States President to announce publicly that he had a living will, and to encourage others to do the same. He told an [[AARP]] town meeting, "So I actually think it's a good idea to have a living will. I'd encourage everybody to get one. I have one; Michelle has one. And we hope we don't have to use it for a long time, but I think it's something that is sensible."&lt;ref&gt;Conolly, Ceci. "Obama takes personal approach in AARP speech," ''The Washington Post'', July 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement followed controversy surrounding proposed health care legislation that included language that would permit the payment of doctors under Medicare to counsel patients regarding living wills, sometimes referred to as the "infamous" page 425.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/28/AR2009072801444.html President Obama Holds a Tele-Townhall Meeting on Health Care with AARP Members], CQ Transcriptions, July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]] issued a call to make living wills mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Appel Jacob M | year = | title = When Any Answer is a Good Answer:  A Mandated Choice Model for Advance Directives | url = | journal = Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 417–422 | doi=10.1017/s0963180110000253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===

Indian [[Supreme Court]] on March 9, 2018 permitted living wills and passive euthanasia. The country's apex court held  that the right to a dignified life extends up to the point of having a dignified death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/death-with-dignity/article23009854.ece|title=Death with dignity: on SC's verdict on euthanasia and living wills|author=|date=10 March 2018|publisher=|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3678">'''Anna Salter''' is an American [[psychologist]] and mystery novelist.

==Education, clinical and research work==
In 1968, Salter earned a BA in English and Philosophy from the [[University of North Carolina]]. Her Masters was in Child Development at [[Tufts University]] (1973), and her Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology and Public Practice at [[Harvard University]] (1977).

Salter has an emphasis in [[sex crime]]s. She has treated the victims of sex crimes, and also has  studied offenders. She has published several books and peer-reviewed articles on sex crimes, given many keynote speeches to professional and law enforcement groups, and consults with the Wisconsin Department of Corrections.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.annasalter.com/annasalter/BIOGRAPHY.html About Anna Salter]" from AnnaSalter.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/wcidentities/lccn-n86-61082|title=Salter, Anna C.  [WorldCat.org]|website=www.worldcat.org|accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Salter has interviewed numerous sex offenders and other criminals, compiling the videotaped interviews along with her commentary and analysis. ''Truth, Lies and Sex Offenders'' is for general audiences, and ''Sadistic Offenders: How They Think, What They Do'' is aimed at professionals and law enforcement.

==Fiction==
As of 2011, Salter has also published four mystery novels: ''Shiny Water'', ''Fault Lines'', ''White Lies'' and ''Prison Blues''. The latter was nominated for a 2003 [[Edgar Award]] for best paperback original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cozy-mystery.com/Edgar-Award-Best-Paperback-Original.html|title=EDGAR ALLAN POE AWARD BEST PAPERBACK ORIGINAL - Cozy Mystery List|website=www.cozy-mystery.com|accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking into consideration the available resources and a spectrum of opportunities, the University library is considered to be the best specialized medical library in the country. 

During the last years the capacity of the University was strengthened by opening various resources, scientific and clinical centers, such as Stem Cells Laboratory, Evidencebased Medicine Centre, Drug Information Centre, Educational-clinical Centre "Stomatology", Diagnostic and Treatment Centre, Clinical Skills Centre etc. Some centers and the laboratories working within framework of the ATSMU are unique in the republic, and provide methodological support to scientific and medical establishments at the national level. 

==International cooperation==
ATSMU is included in the catalogue of the [[Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research]] (FAIMER), the [[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates]] (ECFMG) and the Directory of the Medical Universities of the [[World Health Organization]]. The improvement of the quality of education and advancement of the level of training of the medical staff for the system of public health of the country is the priority goal of the management of the University. To attain this goal the experience of the best foreign medical educational institutions and also all existing real opportunities of the University itself are adopted.  
   
The important directions of University activity is promotion of international cooperation, which facilitates improvement of the quality of curriculums, development of all-round and effective relations with medical institutions, high schools, the foreign research centers. Thus currently University has cooperation links with over 80 scientific - educational institutions of Canada, Austria, France, Germany, Sweden, Poland, China, Iran, Afghanistan, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, as well as successful joint projects with WHO, SDC, USAID, GIZ, [[Global Fund]], [[Soros Foundation]], DAAD, TEMPUS, ISTC, UNFPA that contributes to the development of all-round cooperation with foreign partners.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1596">The last [[execution]] of a civilian carried out in [[Albania]] was a [[hanging]] on 29 June 1995. While capital punishment was abolished for murder on 1 October 2000, it was still retained for treason and military offences. The reason for the abolition of the death penalty in Albania as well as in other European nations is the signing of Protocol No. 6 to the [[ECHR]]. In Albania this came into force on 1 October 2000.

Albania under communism the death penalty was used highly from 1941-1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lajme.shqiperia.com/lajme/artikull/iden/367106/titulli/Varja-e-Havzi-Neles-PD-zbardh-vendimin-dhe-firmen-e-Kristaq-Rames|title=Varja e Havzi Nelës, PD zbardh vendimin dhe firmën e Kristaq Ramës|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klosi.org/news/klosi_news_oponion/154.html|title=KLOSI – Poeti disident Havzi Nela...|work=Klosi News|access-date=2017-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007045122/http://www.klosi.org/news/klosi_news_oponion/154.html#|archive-date=2014-10-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Albania ratified Protocol No. 13 to the ECHR, abolishing the death penalty under all circumstances, replacing it with [[life imprisonment in Albania|life imprisonment]].

''[[Holby City]]'' is a British [[medical drama]] [[television series]] that premiered on 12 January 1999 on [[BBC One]]. The series was created by [[Tony McHale]] and [[Mal Young]] as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from the established [[BBC]] medical drama ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s19/holbycity/news/a191337/holby-citys-exec-producer-stands-down.html |title='Holby City's exec producer stands down |last=Green |first=Kris |date=14 December 2009 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=12 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5r17Zw9V1?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s19/holby-city/news/a191337/holby-citys-exec-producer-stands-down.html |archivedate=6 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is set in the same hospital as ''Casualty'', Holby General, in the fictional city of [[Holby]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19980913/ai_n14478986/?tag=content;col1|title=Soap stars find a new role...

''Holby City'' follows the professional and personal lives of surgeons, nurses, other medical and ancillary staff and patients at Holby General. It features an ensemble cast of regular characters, and began with 11 main characters in its [[Holby City (series 1)|first series]], all of whom have since left the show. New main characters have been both written in and out of the series since. In addition, ''Holby City'' features guest stars each week, as well as recurring guests that take part in story arcs that span a portion of a series. Occasionally, the recurring guest storylines will span multiple series. Many actors in the series have made prior, minor appearances as both patients and staff members in both ''Holby City'' and ''Casualty'' - in some instances crediting these former appearances for their later casting as main characters in ''Holby City''.

==Casting==
In casting the [[Holby City (series 1)|first series]] of ''Holby City'', Young selected actors who were already established names in the acting industry, primarily from a [[soap opera]] background. He cast [[Michael French]] as [[Nick Jordan (character)|Nick Jordan]], [[George Irving (English actor)|George Irving]] as [[Anton Meyer]], [[Angela Griffin]] as [[Jasmine Hopkins]], [[Lisa Faulkner]] as [[Former characters in Holby City#Victoria Merrick|Victoria Merrick]] and [[Nicola Stephenson]] as [[Former characters in Holby City#Julie Bradford|Julie Bradford]]. Young explained: "Soap actors are the best actors. There's been so much snobbery before. The whole thing about typecasting was probably invented by actors who couldn't get other work. From day one I knew I wanted to put on screen people that viewers want to watch. There’s no downside to that."&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holby.tv/cgi-bin/News/fullnews.cgi?newsid1028627054,51091, |title=Holby City Hits 100 |work=Holby Gazette |date=6 August 2002 |accessdate=15 September 2008 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This propensity for hiring established actors continued as the soap progressed, with later roles being awarded to comedian [[Adrian Edmondson]], former film actress [[Patsy Kensit]], and ''[[Jesus of Nazareth (miniseries)|Jesus of Nazareth]]'' star [[Robert Powell]].&lt;ref name="shelley"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Jim Shelley (TV critic)|Jim Shelley]]|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/comment/0,,2182492,00.html|title=How to make a BBC medical drama|date=3 October 2007|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=4 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Jane Asher]] was cast in the recurring role of [[Lady Byrne]] in 2007, ''[[Inside Soap]]'' magazine asked series producer Diane Kyle whether the production team intentionally sought out "well-known-names", or whether roles simply went to the actor best-suited for the part. Kyle responded: "It's lovely when we have a new member of the cast come in and bring an audience with them. But we want the best actors, and the star names we cast are always the best - which is why we go for them."&lt;ref name="insidesoap"&gt;{{Cite news|publication-date=November 2007|title=Ask the BOSS!|periodical=[[Inside Soap]]|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cast members who play main characters have made previous appearances in ''Holby City'' and ''Casualty'' in minor roles.

[[Joseph Millson]] plays Luc Hemingway, an eccentric and extremely intelligent [[specialist registrar]]. He first appears in November 2011, episode "Under The Skin", while on the roof with Nurse Eddi McKee. His double fellowship and unsociable manner winds Eddi (Sarah Jane Potts) up, and causes lots of hilariously funny banter to be batted between them. In the episode "Ribbons", he kisses her, but the aftermath of the kiss shows that he offered no explanation and even disappeared from the ward to focus on research to avoid her. The episodes "Unsafe Haven (Part 1 &amp; 2)" were focused on the beginning of their relationship, bought about by Luc allowing Eddi to see a more sensitive side of him when he blames himself for the death of a friend, the security guard, and the outbreak of Legionnaires. In "Long Way Down", Eddi and Luc are shown as finally being in a relationship. Luc is offered a permanent contract, and plans to take the contract. However, the end of the episode shows that Luc has left, with no explanation. He returned in "A Crack in the Ice", for a brief period of time. After the departure of Eddi, it is shown that Luc was struggling to cope. When Luc is confronted by a patient in "Blood Ties", we find out that he was an Army Doctor in Sierra Leone.

'''Charles Dexter Phelps''' (September 16, 1937 – September 13, 1985) was a prominent [[United States|American]] [[medical doctor]], [[professor]], and [[researcher]] in the field of [[ophthalmology]]. The clinical studies he oversaw contributed to significant advances in the scientific understanding and [[surgical]] and [[pharmacological]] treatment of [[glaucoma]].

==Biography==
Born in [[San Antonio, Texas]], and raised in [[Waterloo, Iowa]], Phelps was the eldest of four sons, all of whom became medical doctors or scientists, born to Gardner Dexter Phelps, M.D., a private-practice ophthalmologist, and Virginia Kuning Phelps.

Phelps earned his undergraduate ([[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], 1959; [[Phi Beta Kappa]]) and medical ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], 1963; [[Alpha Omega Alpha]]) degrees at the [[University of Iowa]] in [[Iowa City]]. He completed an internship at [[Boston City Hospital]] between 1963 and 1964, and a residency there in [[internal medicine]] in the following year. From 1965 to 1967, he served in the [[United States Air Force]] as a doctor at [[Andrews Air Force Base]] near [[Washington, D.C.]]

In 1967, Phelps returned to Iowa City to work for a year as an [[NIH]] postdoctoral fellow under [[Mansour F. Armaly]] in the University of Iowa's glaucoma research laboratory, an experience that persuaded him to become a glaucoma specialist.  He continued at the university as a resident in [[ophthalmology]] from 1968 to 1971. For the following year, he was an [[NIH]] special fellow under [[Bernard Becker]] in the department of ophthalmology at [[Washington University in St. Louis]].

Returning to the University of Iowa College of Medicine in 1972 to join its faculty, Phelps succeeded his mentor Armaly as director of the department of ophthalmology's glaucoma service. He attended to hundreds of patients, educated scores of medical students, and wrote dozens of articles for medical journals reporting on the findings of the medical studies he oversaw.

In 1984, after rising to the rank of full professor, Phelps was appointed chair of the university's ophthalmology department, widely recognized as one of the foremost eye clinics in the country. Soon afterward, he was diagnosed with [[cancer]]. He died eighteen months later at the age of 47, survived by his wife Margaret Dorsey Phelps, whom he married in 1964, his four children, his parents, and his brothers.

Phelps was a founding member of the [[American Glaucoma Society]].  At its first meeting, convened in his honor in Iowa City in 1987, a [[Common hawthorn|Hawthorn]] [[tree]] was planted, which still stands outside the ophthalmology department, to commemorate his life and contributions. In a keynote address, Armaly described him as "a prolific contributor of new knowledge" who left a "scientific legacy admirable in its size, variety, and quality," concluding, "There is hardly an area in glaucoma that did not interest him and benefit from his research effort."

'''Adolf Fritz''', generally called '''Dr. Fritz''' ([[Munich]], ? &amp;ndash; [[Estonia]], 1918), was a hypothetical [[Germany|German]] [[surgeon]] whose [[spiritism|spirit]] has allegedly been [[mediumship|channeled]] by several [[Brazil]]ian [[Psychic surgery|psychic surgeon]]s, starting with [[Zé Arigó]] in the 1950s and continuing up to the present.  There is no proof that he actually existed.

==Alleged manifestations==
In the 1950s, psychic surgeon Zé Arigó (1918&amp;ndash;1971) claimed to be operating as a channel for the spirit of a Dr. Adolf Fritz, a German doctor who had died in [[World War I]]. Arigó became famous in Brazil and abroad, and was the subject of documentaries and books.  Soon after predicting his own death, he died in an automobile accident.

After Arigó's death in a car accident, two brothers, [[Oscar Wilde (Brazilian psychic surgeon)|Oscar]] and [[Edivaldo Wilde]], claimed to channel the spirit of Dr. Fritz. Their careers were cut short when both died in violent car crashes.&lt;!--Dates?--&gt;

Following them was Edson Quieroz, a gynecologist. Quieroz treated hundreds of thousands of patients in the guise of Dr. Fritz, while further advancing the techniques of Arigó. He, too, met a violent death at the hand of a knife-wielding assailant.

After Quieroz's death, Dr. Fritz has been allegedly channeled by [[Rubens Farias Jr.]] (1954&amp;ndash; ) of [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]]; who claims that Dr. Fritz has predicted his own violent death. More recently Dr. Fritz manifests himself through Mr. Kleber Aran Ferreira da Silva [http://www.drfritzamorsupremo.com.br/site/] who successfully attends patients on a monthly base and free of charge in Maceió, Aracajú, Salvador and São Paulo.

Several other mediums have been reportedly able to channel Dr. Fritz' spirit. Most times operations are performed with the tip of the finger, no physical incision necessary, even though in some cases a light scar of the incision as well as of the stitches can be shortly seen. When asked about the improbability of the same spirit being channeled by more than one medium at the same time, some entities have indicated that the spirit does not follow the same rules of time and space that we do and, therefore, wields such an ability.

==Alleged biography==
In a [[Mediumship|mediunic]] interview, channeled by Arigó, the spirit of Dr. Fritz said that he had been born in [[Munich]].  His father suffered from [[asthma]] and a doctor recommended that he move to a place with a better climate, so the family moved to [[Poland]] when the boy was only four years old.  Forced to work when he was young because of his parent's premature death, Fritz studied [[medicine]] on his own.  One month before graduating, a general came into his office with his daughter in his arms, and despite his efforts, Fritz could not save her.  The officer accused Fritz of her death and had him put in jail, where he suffered all sorts of tortures.  He escaped from the jail and fled to [[Estonia]], where he lived from 1914 until his death in 1918.

Exhaustive research has found no mention of a doctor with any of those names in German records.  Followers of Arigó have retorted that the name provided by the spirit, as well as the German-like accent of his channels, were probably faked by Dr. Fritz himself, in order to preserve his true identity.  Skeptics insist that the psychic surgeons themselves have invented the entity.

'''Hair washing'''  is the cosmetic act of keeping [[hair]] clean by washing it with [[shampoo]] or other [[detergent]] products and water. [[Hair conditioner]] may also be used to improve hair's texture and manageability. [[Two-in-one shampoo]]s, which have both detergent and conditioning components, are now commonly also used as a replacement for shampoo and conditioner. 

To remove the [[sebum]] from the hair, some people apply a [[surfactant]], most usually shampoo, but sometimes soap to their hair and lather the surfactant with water. The surfactant is rinsed out with water along with the freed dirt and dust it bonds to.

There are also [[dry shampoo]]s, which are powders which remove [[sebum]] from the hair by soaking it up prior to being combed out.

==Hairdressing==
{{main|Hairdressing}}

Most hairdressers, in countries such as Canada, the U.S., and European and Latin American countries, offer a hair wash as a service before or after a hair cut. This is usually done to make hair more manageable for the hairdresser who will be performing the hair cut. After a hair cut, it can help remove any loose strands of hair that may be bothersome to the client. It is also quite a relaxing practice, and many clients enjoy a hair wash as their favourite part of a hair cut.
Hairdressers use specialized basins to perform a hair wash, and these can be either forward or backward style.      

In the backward version (which is more common), the client sits down in a chair, and leans their head back into a sink, with the hairdresser standing behind them. 
                                                                              
In the forward version, the client leans forwards over a sink, and the hairdresser stands over them to wash their hair.     
In some parts of the world, such as China, it is not uncommon to see what is referred to as an 'upright' shampoo. In this style, the client simply sits in a chair as they normally would, while a hairdresser applies shampoo to their hair and adds water. They then rinse out in a basin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18438">'''Health in Cuba''' refers to the overall health of the population of Cuba.

There was an overall improvement in ''Health in Cuba'' in terms of disease and infant mortality rates after [[Cuban revolution|the revolution]].&lt;ref name="bethell" /&gt;   Like the rest of the [[Economy of Cuba|Cuban economy]], Cuban medical care suffered following the end of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[subsidies]] in 1991; the stepping up of the [[US embargo against Cuba]] at this time also had an effect. Cuba has one of the highest [[life expectancy]] rates in the region, with the average citizen living to 78.05 years old&lt;ref name="CIA World FactBook - Cuba" /&gt; (in comparison to the United States' 78.62 years&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html CIA World FactBook - US] - 2009&lt;/ref&gt;).

==History==

In the 1950s, the island had some of the most positive health indices in the Americas, not far behind the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. Cuba was one of the leaders in [[life expectancy]], and the number of doctors per thousand of the population ranked above Britain, France and the Netherlands. In Latin America it ranked in third place after Uruguay and Argentina.&lt;ref name="Gott" /&gt;
There remained marked inequalities however. Most of Cuba's doctors were based in the relatively prosperous cities and regional towns, and conditions in rural areas, notably [[Oriente Province|Oriente]], were significantly worse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]], ''Cuba : The pursuit of Freedom''. p968-970 "[since the revolution] The distribution of food has been erratic. Still, few die of malnutrition and, particularly in Oriente province, the very poor peasants must be fed better and more regularly than before the revolution" - "The revolution has in many ways improved everybody's health. Medicines are more fairly distributed throughout the country. Preventative medicine has been much emphasized and many clinics have been established in rural areas."&lt;/ref&gt; The mortality rate was the third lowest in the world.&lt;ref name="beforecastro"/&gt; According to the World Health Organization, the island had the lowest infant mortality rate of Latin America.&lt;ref name="beforecastro" /&gt;

Following the Revolution and the subsequent [[United States embargo against Cuba]], an increase in [[disease]] and [[infant mortality]] worsened in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="bethell" /&gt; The new [[Politics of Cuba|Cuban government]] asserted that universal healthcare was to become a priority of state planning. In 1960 revolutionary and [[physician]] [[Che Guevara]] outlined his aims for the future of Cuban healthcare in an essay entitled ''[[On Revolutionary Medicine]]'', stating: "The work that today is entrusted to the Ministry of Health and similar organizations is to provide public health services for the greatest possible number of persons, institute a program of preventive medicine, and orient the public to the performance of hygienic practices."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0105guevara.htm On Revolutionary Medicine by Che Guevara] Monthly review&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Soviet Union===
The loss of Soviet subsidies brought food shortages to Cuba in the early 1990s.

A [[Canadian Medical Association Journal]] paper states that "The famine in Cuba during the Special Period was caused by political and economic factors similar to the ones that caused a famine in North Korea in the mid-1990s. Both countries were run by authoritarian regimes that denied ordinary people the food to which they were entitled when the public food distribution collapsed; priority was given to the elite classes and the military."&lt;ref name="cmaj" /&gt; The regime did not accept donations of food, medicines and money from the US until 1993.&lt;ref name="cmaj"/&gt;

[[Malnutrition]] created epidemics, but it had positive effects too. Manuel Franco describes the Special Period as "the first, and probably the only, natural experiment, born of unfortunate circumstances, where large effects on diabetes, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality have been related to sustained population-wide weight loss as a result of increased physical activity and reduced caloric intake".&lt;ref name="francocrisis"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/sep/27/cuba.international|title=Economic crisis boost to health of Cubans|publisher=The Guardian | location=London | first=Rory | last=Carroll | date=27 September 2007 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison of pre- and post-revolutionary indices==
Life expectancy at birth in Cuba in 1955 was 63 years.&lt;ref name="cubafacts43"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctp.iccas.miami.edu/FACTS_Web/Cuba%20Facts%20Issue%2043%20December.htm|title=Cuba facts issue 43|date=December 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1960 it was 63.9 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN/countries/CU?display=graph Life expectancy at birth, total (years)]; retrieved 2010-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
To put these values in context, life expectancy at birth in some other regions and countries in 1960 were as follows (World Bank data):&lt;br/&gt;World, 50.18 years;&lt;br/&gt;Latin America and Caribbean, 56.21 years;&lt;br/&gt;high-income OECD countries, 69.01 years;&lt;br/&gt;United States, 69.77 years.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, Quick Query (op cit.), retrieved 2009. High income OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries were defined by the World Bank in 2009 as those with 2007 per capita GNI of at least $US 11,456 (notes to Quick Query).
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the life expectancies at birth were as follows (World Bank data):&lt;br/&gt;Cuba, 78.26 years;&lt;br/&gt;World, 68.76 years;&lt;br/&gt;Latin America and Caribbean, 73.13 years;&lt;br/&gt;high income OECD countries, 79.66 years;&lt;br/&gt;United States, 77.99 years.&lt;ref name="WorldB_QQ"&gt;World Bank, Quick Query, op cit., retrieved 2009-07-01
.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mortality rate for children under five years old was 54 per 1000 in Cuba in 1960 (World Bank).&lt;ref&gt;Quick Query, op cit., retrieved July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
That year in Latin America and the Caribbean it was 154.66 per 1000; in the high-income OECD countries it was 43.11; in the United States, 30.2. No World datum is available for 1960, but for 1970 it was 145.67 per 1000 (all World Bank data).&lt;ref name="WorldB_QQ" /&gt;

The mortality rates for children under five in 2007 were as follows (World Bank):&lt;br/&gt;Cuba, 6.5;&lt;br/&gt;World, 68.01;&lt;br/&gt;Latin America and Caribbean, 26.37;&lt;br/&gt;high-income OECD, 5.71;&lt;br/&gt;United States, 7.60.&lt;ref name="WorldB_QQ"/&gt;

Infant mortality was 32 per 1000 live births in Cuba in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Note: the source for this datum quotes data selectively and may not be a reliable source according to Wikipedia's standards. {{cite web|url=http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/ca/cuba/asce/cuba8/30smith.pdf|title=Renaissance and decay: A comparison of socioeconomic indicators in pre-Castro and current-day Cuba|author=Kirby Smith and Hugo Llorens|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713105818/http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/ca/cuba/asce/cuba8/30smith.pdf|archivedate=2009-07-13|df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000–2005 it was 6.1 per 1000 in Cuba; and, for comparison, 6.8 per 1000 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2006/WPP2006_Highlights_rev.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 infant mortality rates published by the World Health Organisation in 2009 were:&lt;br/&gt;
Cuba, 5;&lt;br/&gt;
World, 46;&lt;br/&gt;
High income countries, 6;&lt;br/&gt;
United States, 6.&lt;ref&gt;These are the probability of dying between birth and age one, per 1000 live births. World Health Organisation, [http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2009/en/index.html ''World Health Statistics 2009''], Table 1, "Mortality and burden of disease." Retrieved 2009-07-01
.&lt;/ref&gt;

The table below shows CEPAL (United nations) data spanning the pre- and post-revolutionary periods for three public [[health indicators]]. Health levels were better than the Latin American average before the revolution and showed continued steady improvement throughout the post-revolutionary period. The total mortality rate shown is the crude – ''i.e.'', not age-adjusted – rate, and therefore tends to rise as the proportion of elderly people in the population increases, which has been the case in Cuba because the birth rate is falling and life expectancy is rising.

===Health indicators and issues===
Cuba began a food rationing program in 1962 to guarantee all citizens a low-priced basket of basic foods. As of 2007, the government was spending about $1&amp;nbsp;billion annually to subsidise the food ration. The ration would cost about $50 at an average grocery store in the United States, but the Cuban citizen pays only $1.20 for it. The ration includes rice, legumes, potatoes, bread, eggs, and a small amount of meat. It provides about 30 to 70 percent of the 3,300 kilocalories that the average Cuban consumes daily. The people obtain the rest of their food from government stores (''Tiendas''), free market stores and cooperatives, barter, their own gardens, and the black market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/02/AR2007070201103.html | title=Living on Cuban Food Ration Isn't Easy | publisher=Washington Post | first=Anita | last=Snow | accessdate=2010-05-04 | date=2 July 2007 }};&lt;br/&gt;United States Department of Agriculture, {{cite web|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/itp/cuba/CubaSituation0308.pdf|title=Cuba’s Food &amp; Agriculture Situation Report|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105150934/http://www.fas.usda.gov/itp/cuba/CubaSituation0308.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-05|df=}}. The Post article says that the government estimates that the ration meets about 1/3 of a person's food requirement; but the USDA Report (p 24 of the.pdf) says the ration meets roughly 2/3, although estimates vary.
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Pan American Health Organization, daily caloric intake per person in various places in 2003 were as follows (unit is kilocalories):&lt;br/&gt;
Cuba, 3,286;&lt;br/&gt;

The reasons people die in Cuba tend to be the same as in high-income, developed, countries. The table at right shows the relative seriousness of communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases (e.g., heart disease and cancer) and injuries, in various parts of the world. Data is from the World Health Organisation and is for year 2004.

Diseases of the circulatory system are the most common cause of death in Cuba, killing 306 people per 100,000 population in 2005. Neoplasms (cancer) are second, killing 173 per 100,000 population in 2005. The numbers killed by some other causes, in 2005 per 100,000 population, were: influenza and pneumonia 64, accidents 40, diabetes mellitus 18, intentional self-harm (suicide) 12, cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases 10. Total mortality per 100,000 population was 754.

[[Abortion]] rates, which are high in Cuba, increased dramatically during the 1980s, but had almost halved by 1999 and declined to near-1970s levels of 32.0 per 1000 pregnancies. The rate is still among the highest in Latin America.&lt;ref name="sixto"&gt;[http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/asce/pdfs/volume12/sixto.pdf An evaluation of four decades of Cuban healthcare] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619225952/http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/asce/pdfs/volume12/sixto.pdf |date=2010-06-19 }}. Filipe Eduardo Sixto, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among adults less than 49 years old, accidents are the leading cause of death, though occupational accidents have declined significantly in the last decade. The homicide rate is 7.0 per 100,000. The rate of suicide in the island is higher than average in Latin America and has been among the highest in the region and the world since the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;To Die in Cuba: Suicide and Society. By Louis A. Pérez, Jr. [http://muse.jhu.edu/cgi-bin/access.cgi?uri=/journals/journal_of_interdisciplinary_history/v037/37.2fuente.html access online]&lt;/ref&gt; Annual suicide deaths per 100,000 population (2003–2005 data) were: Cuba 13.6, Americas 7.7, Latin America and Caribbean 5.8, Latin Caribbean 8.7, United States 10.8.&lt;ref&gt;Pan American Health Organization, ''Health situation in the Americas: Basic Indicators 2009'', op cit., p 6.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Among older adults [[heart disease]] and [[cancer]] predominate as causes of mortality. General mortality has been "characterized by a marked predominance of causes associated with chronic noncommunicable diseases", according to the [[Pan American Health Organization]].&lt;ref name="PAN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paho.org/english/sha/prflcub.htm|title=Cuba Demographic indicators|publisher=Pan American Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Preventive medicine|preventive medical care]], [[Medical test|diagnostic test]]s and [[medication]] for hospitalized patients are free, some aspects of healthcare are paid for by the patient. Items which are paid by patients who can afford it are: drugs prescribed on an [[outpatient]] basis, hearing, [[Dental insurance|dental]], and [[orthopedic]] processes, [[wheelchair]]s and [[crutch]]es. When a patient can obtain these items at state stores, prices tend to be low as these items are subsidized by the state. For patients on a low-income, these items are free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry M. Spiegel and Annalee Yassi "Lessons from the margins of globalization: appreciating the Cuban health paradox" in Journal of Public Health Policy, Volume 25, Number 1, 2004, pp. 85–110(26)[http://www.jphp.umb.edu/documents/204-020_Health_25_1_spiegel.pdf online]. "Patients pay for drugs, hearing, dental, and orthopedic prostheses, wheelchairs, crutches, and similar items but prices are low and subsidized by the state; and in the case of low-income patients, these items are offered free of charge"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7706">Expenditure on health in Senegal was 4.7% of [[GDP]] in 2014,  US$107 per capita. 

Life expectancy at birth was estimated as 65 years for men in 2016 and 69 for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Senegal |url=https://www.who.int/countries/sen/en/ |accessdate=24 November 2018 |publisher=WHO |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 data, 54% of the population of Senegal was below the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]], which has implications on people's wellbeing.&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency, "World Fact Book: Senegal." Last modified Feb 05 2013. Accessed March 19, 2013. https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sg.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Common medical problems in Senegal include [[child mortality]], [[maternal death]], [[malaria]], and [[sexual diseases]] including [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="transportation" /&gt; There is a high disparity in both the quality and extent of health services between [[urban area|urban]] and [[rural]] areas.&lt;ref name="transportation"&gt;Heyen-Perschon, Jürgen. "Report on current situation in the health sector of Senegal and possible roles for non-motorised transport interventions." Institution for Transportation and Development Policy. (2005). Accessed March 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest problems in public health are in the East and South ([[Louga]], [[Kaolack]], and [[Tambacounda]]) and the region of [[Casamance]].

==Specific diseases==
[[File:Malaria trivia contest promotes healthy behaviors (6096150489).jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|In Senegal, Mbacke Primary School students compete in a trivia contest to see who knows the most about malaria. (Antoinette Sullivan/USAID), 24 August 2011.]]

A number of diseases continue to afflict persons who live in and travel to Senegal, some of which are related to Senegal's tropical climate. One of the most prominent diseases is [[malaria]], a parasitic disease transmitted by mosquito bites. One of Senegal's strategies for combating malaria has been the National Program for the Fight Against Malaria. Other diseases affecting Senegal include:
*[[Syphilis]], which is directly related to the social environment, poor health, and housing conditions
*[[Tuberculosis]], which is mostly localized in [[Dakar]] and Thies, and affects more men than women, with approximately 9500 cases of tuberculosis per year in Senegal and a 2-4% mortality rate
*[[Schistosomiasis]], a parasitic disease common in the tropics
*[[Trypanosomiasis]], or sleeping sickness, a parasitic disease that has long affected the valleys in Eastern Senegal, known as Ferlo
*[[Meningitis]], with outbreaks between February and March, especially in Eastern Senegal and occasionally in Dakar.
*[[Cholera]], with outbreaks continuing to be problematic. In 2007 alone, there were over 2000 reported cases of cholera in Senegal.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;The Report: Senegal 2008. Oxford Business Group, 2008. https://books.google.com/books?id=DG2mhyhrtKkC. Accessed April 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
The rate of [[HIV/AIDS]] in Senegal is one of the lowest in Africa, at approximately 0.9%. According to the [[UNAIDS]], the proportion of adults between the ages of 15 and 49 with HIV/AIDS is approximately 0.9%. The [[Casamance]] region has the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS at 2.0%, which can be attributed in part to the [[Casamance conflict]]. There are about 59,000 people in Senegal living with HIV/AIDS, according to a 2009 estimate.&lt;ref name="cia" /&gt;

==Women's healthcare concerns==
A number of healthcare concerns afflict women in particular, among them female genital mutilation, maternal healthcare, and gendered healthcare discrepancies. Further, the restructuring of the health care system has also affected women significantly.

===Female genital mutilation===
About 20 percent of Senegalese women undergo [[female genital mutilation]] of some kind, with the most prevalent procedure being the removal of the tip of the clitoris, according to the National Program Against Female Genital Mutilation.&lt;ref name="bop"&gt;Bop, C. 2006. "Islam and women's sexual health and rights in Senegal." ''Muslim World Journal of Human Rights'' 2, no. 1: Scopus®, EBSCOhost. Accessed April 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not widespread among the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] or [[Serer people|Serer]], but is more common among the [[Fula people|Fulani]], the [[Jola people|Diola]], the [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleurs]] and the [[Mandinka people|Mandingo]]. Notably, FGM has no [[Islamic]] basis.&lt;ref name="bop" /&gt;
[[File:DakarContraception.jpg|thumb|right|alt=alt text|Contraception prevention campaign on walls in Dakar, Senegal. (11 June 2006).]]

===Births and fertility===
The [[birth rate]] in Senegal is about 36.19 births per 1000 people, according to a 2012 estimate.&lt;ref name="cia" /&gt; The [[fertility rate]], according to 2007 estimates, is relatively high, with an average of 5 children per woman. Moreover, the [[infant mortality rate]] is 55.16 deaths per 1,000 live births,&lt;ref name="cia" /&gt; and the infant mortality rate of males is slightly higher than that of females.

===Abortion===
There are many cultural and social barriers that limit [[abortion]] in Senegal. Studies have shown that there is strong opposition, from both men and women, to women's individual choice and agency with abortions, family planning, and sexual health.&lt;ref name="bop" /&gt; Therapeutic abortion is allowed to protect a woman's health or life if threatened by pregnancy, but abortion of any other kind is banned.&lt;ref name="bop" /&gt;

==Children's health==
[[File:A child waits outside a medical clinic as part of Western Accord 2012 in Thies, Senegal, June 10, 2012 120610-Z-KE462-197.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A child waits outside a medical clinic as part of Western Accord 2012 in Thies, Senegal, June 10, 2012.]]

Children's health in Senegal is of primary concern to development strategists, and is heavily influenced by the health, education, and wellbeing of women. According to data from 2005, 14.5% percent of Senegalese children under the age of 5 were [[underweight]].&lt;ref name="cia" /&gt; Only 42% of children between 12 and 23 months received all necessary vaccinations. Children whose mothers have a primary education have a lower prevalence of [[malnutrition]], and children whose mothers have advanced education are most likely to have the lowest incidence of malnutrition.&lt;ref name="badji" /&gt;

Rates of malnutrition are most pronounced among infants between one and two years old. Barriers to children's health include:

*maternal misunderstanding of the nutritional needs of the child
*a lack of nutritional follow-up of the children
*the non-practice of the exclusive breast feeding at least for the first four months of life of the infant
*a misunderstanding of good weaning practices
*the precariousness of the health condition of the children (frequency of the febrile episodes associated with diarrhea and respiratory infections)
*poor living standards
*difficulty accessing access to certain basic elements

The nutritional health conditions of children less than five years old may relate to the age as well as the child's cycle of life, the size and place of residence, elements linked to the household environment such as the nature of the soil of the housing, the source of supply in drinking water, the evacuation mode of the domestic garbage, and the mother's level of education.&lt;ref name="badji"&gt;Badji, Marie Suzanne, and Dorothee Boccanfuso.

The '''International Olive Council''' ('''IOC''') (formerly the '''International Olive Oil Council''' ('''IOOC''')) is an [[intergovernmental organisation]] of states that produce [[olive]]s or products derived from olives, such as [[olive oil]].

==History==
The IOOC had its genesis in the '''International Agreement on Olive Oil''', which was concluded in [[Geneva]] on 17 October 1955. After this treaty was amended and the amended version came into force, the IOOC was established under this treaty in 1959, with headquarters in [[Madrid]]. This first agreement remained in force until 1963, when a second agreement was negotiated. The organisation was governed by the following agreements during the time spans indicated:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
*1956 International Olive Oil Agreement (amended 1955 Agreement) (1956–1963)
*1963 International Olive Oil Agreement (1963–1979)
*1979 International Olive Oil Agreement (1979–1986)
*1986 International Agreement on Olive Oil and Table Olives (1986–2005)
*2005 '''International Agreement on Olive Oil and Table Olives''' (2005–)
*2015 '''International Agreement on Olive Oil and Table Olives''' (2015–)

}}

A new Agreement was negotiated and concluded In October 2015 and will be open for signature throughout 2016. In 2006, the International Olive Oil Council changed its name to the International Olive Council in recognition of the fact that the Council is also involved in the field of table olives (the name of its governing Agreement had recognised this since 1986).
*2016 Decision No Dec-18/S.Ex. 27-V/2016  Revising the Trade Standard applying To Olive Oils and Olive Pomace Oils

==Member states==
The IOC currently has 17 state members plus the [[European Union]]. These states account for over 98 per cent of the world's olive production. The following states of the IOC are below (the year of the state's first ratification of one of the Agreements is included; an asterisk indicates that the state was a founding member of the IOOC):

=== Membership requirements ===
Because the IOC is an international, intergovernmental organisation, membership is only open to the Governments of States or to international organisations with responsibilities in the negotiation, conclusion and application of international agreements, especially commodity agreements.
If a country is interested in joining, its government submits an application to the Council of Members, usually through its Ministry of Foreign Affairs or another ministry, or through its embassy in Spain.
The Council of Members examines the application and determines the conditions of accession of the applicant country. This includes fixing the number of participation shares in the IOC budget and setting a time limit for the country to file its instrument of accession with the depository of the Agreement. As soon as the applicant deposits its instrument it becomes a Member.
Private companies or individuals cannot join the IOC.

==Observers==
Three categories of observer are allowed to attend all or part of IOC sessions, provided they have the prior consent of the Council of Members. 
*International organisations and institutions. This includes the United Nations and its organs, in particular the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), the Joint FAO/WHO Programme of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and other specialised UN agencies.
*Intergovernmental, governmental and non-governmental organisations that could provide funding for IOC activities.
*The government of any member or observer State of the United Nations or of one of the organisations mentioned in the first bullet that envisages joining the Agreement.

== Headquarters ==
The IOC has been headquartered in Madrid since it was founded in 1959. The rights, immunities and privileges of the IOC headquarters, staff and representatives are stipulated in a Headquarters Agreement signed with the Kingdom of Spain, which is the host country of the Organisation.

== Official languages ==
The IOC has five official languages (Arabic, English, French, Italian and Spanish) and two working languages (English and French).

== Funding ==
The IOC is funded through compulsory contributions paid by its Member States. Contributions are calculated each year according to the number of participation shares awarded to each Member in the IOC budget.

== Structure ==
The structure of the IOC is quite simple. It revolves around the key figures of the Council of Members and its committees, the IOC chair and the Executive Secretariat.

=== Council of Members ===
The Council of Members is the principal decision-making body of the IOC. It is made up of one delegate per Member, who is assisted by alternates and advisers. It meets at least once a year to review IOC work and to approve the action programme and budget for the next year. 
The Council of Members takes decisions by consensus. If consensus is not reached, decision making is done by a qualified majority.

=== Committees ===
The committees discuss and lay the groundwork for proposals and three-year action plans which are then submitted to the Council of Members. The IOC has five committees: 
* Economic Committee: This committee discusses and approves the statistics compiled by the Executive Secretariat on production, consumption, imports, exports and stocks of olive oils and table olives. It keeps track of market developments and national policymaking in the olive sector and makes proposals to achieve balanced supply and demand.
* Technical Committee: The brief of this committee is to review and discuss the programmes and activities proposed by the Executive Secretariat in the areas of olive oil chemistry and standardisation, research and development, technology transfer, training and customised technical assistance for the member countries.
* Promotion Committee: Ongoing and future promotional activities and campaigns to promote olive oil and table olive consumption are examined by this committee, which marks out the direction of IOC promotional policy.
* Financial Committee: This committee sees to the financial control of the IOC. It examines the IOC financial statements and yearly audit and analyses the draft budgets proposed by the Executive Secretariat. It is also responsible for developing and updating all IOC financial procedures.
* Advisory Committee on Olive Oil and Table Olives: This committee is a fundamental talking partner for the Council of Members. Its representatives are drawn from all the branches of the olive sector in the member countries: producers, processors, marketers and consumers. It was established to voice the opinions of business circles and to help the Executive Secretariat to find effective solutions to any issues.

=== IOC Chair ===
The Council of Members elects a chairperson who serves a one-year term of office, which is rotated among the IOC Members. The chairperson plays a vital part in the life of the Organisation and carries out many duties, most importantly presiding over meetings and sessions and representing the IOC legally. 
A vice-chair is also elected each year and succeeds to the chair the following year.

=== Executive Secretariat ===

The IOC is served by a Secretariat headed by an Executive Director, who is assisted by senior officials and other staff. The Executive Secretariat is the operative arm of the IOC, implementing its decisions and strategy and serving the needs of its Members. It is made up of six Units: Economic Survey Unit, Technical Unit, Chemistry &amp; Standardisation Unit, Promotion Unit, Administrative Unit and Financial Unit.

==IOC trade standards==
Some  very important aspects of the IOC work is to promote consumer confidence,  stimulate international trade and to prevent fraud. The IOC has two trade standards: 
* for liquid [[olive oil]]s and [[olive pomace oil]]s 
* for edible fruit [called [[Olive#Table_olives|table olives]]] and derivative products.
===International cooperation===
Part of the remit of the IOC is to ensure compliance with the latest [[food technology]] standards by working very closely with leading chemists from its member countries who contribute their knowledge and expertise. 

It also cooperates with other international organisations such as the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) or the [[Codex Alimentarius]] Commission in order to ensure their testing methods and standards remain updated and compatible or comparable with the standards of other relevant agencies. 
===Standard naming practice for oils and table olives === 
To avoid confusion IOC Members are committed to prohibiting the use of any product names other than those explicitly specified in the IOC standard.

'''The olive oil standard''' fixes the names and definitions of the different categories of olive oils and olive pomace oils as well the quality and purity criteria for each grade of product.
 
'''The table olive standard''' fixes the names, definitions and requirements for all the common [[List of olive cultivars|varieties]], the [[pickling]] or [[preservative]] methods as well as trade preparations of table olives such as pastes and decorative presentations.
===Quality assurance===
The IOC specifies acceptable [[quality control]] testing methods as well as specifying other consumer  [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] information, for example: [[hygiene]] standards along the [[supply chain]], suitable packing materials and filling tolerances [[Label#Products|product labelling]] standards,identification of any [[food additive]]s or allowable [[contaminant]]s, recommendations for [[environmental protection]] in the use and disposal of olive products etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationaloliveoil.org/estaticos/view/222-standards IOC specifications page]&lt;/ref&gt;
.

==Classification of olive oils and olive pomace oils==
The different categories of olive oils and olive pomace oils are named and defined in the International Agreement and the IOC trade standard.&lt;ref&gt;Source:[http://www.internationaloliveoil.org/web/aa-ingles/oliveWorld/aceite1.html Designations and definitions of olive oils]&lt;/ref&gt;

Olive oil is the oil obtained solely from the fruit of the olive tree (Olea europaea L.) which has been extracted mechanically. Oils obtained using solvents or re-esterification processes are excluded as are any mixture with oils of other kinds&lt;ref name=IOC&gt;[http://www.internationaloliveoil.org/estaticos/view/83-designations-and-definitions-of-olive-oils IOC official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;. Olive oil may be either [[eating|edible]] or [[:wikt:inedible|industrial]]  and is marketed in accordance with the following designations and definition&lt;ref name=IOC/&gt;:

Virgin olive oils are the oils obtained from the fruit of the olive tree solely by mechanical or other physical means under conditions, particularly thermal conditions, that do not lead to alterations in the oil, and which have not undergone any treatment other than washing, decantation, centrifugation and filtration.

Virgin olive oils fit for consumption as they are include:

# '''Extra virgin olive oil''': virgin olive oil which has a [[Olive oil acidity|free acidity]], expressed as oleic acid, of not more than 0.8 grams per 100 grams, and the other characteristics of which correspond to those fixed for this category in the IOC standard.
# '''Virgin olive oil''': virgin olive oil which has a [[Olive oil acidity|free acidity]], expressed as oleic acid, of not more than 2 grams per 100 grams and the other characteristics of which correspond to those fixed for this category in the IOC standard
# '''Ordinary virgin olive oil''': virgin olive oil which has a [[Olive oil acidity|free acidity]], expressed as oleic acid, of not more than 3.3 grams per 100 grams and the other characteristics of which correspond to those fixed for this category in the IOC standard.&lt;ref group=note name=R1&gt;This designation may only be sold direct to the consumer if permitted in the country of retail sale. If not permitted, the designation of this product shall comply with the legal provisions of the country concerned.&lt;/ref&gt;

Virgin olive oil not fit for consumption as it is, designated lampante virgin olive oil, is virgin olive oil which has a [[Olive oil acidity|free acidity]], expressed as oleic acid, of more than 3.3 grams per 100 grams and/or the organoleptic characteristics and other characteristics of which correspond to those fixed for this category in the IOC standard. It is intended for refining or for technical use.

Refined olive oil is the olive oil obtained from virgin olive oils by refining methods which do not lead to alterations in the initial glyceridic structure. It has a [[Olive oil acidity|free acidity]], expressed as oleic acid, of not more than 0.3 grams per 100 grams and its other characteristics correspond to those fixed for this category in the IOC standard.&lt;ref group=note name=R2&gt;This designation may only be sold direct to the consumer if permitted in the country of retail sale.&lt;/ref&gt;

Olive oil is the oil consisting of a blend of refined olive oil and virgin olive oils fit for consumption as they are. It has a [[Olive oil acidity|free acidity]], expressed as oleic acid, of not more than 1 gram per 100 grams and its other characteristics correspond to those fixed for this category in the IOC standard.&lt;ref group=note name=R3&gt;The country of retail sale may require a more specific designation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Olive pomace oil is the oil obtained by treating olive pomace with solvents or other physical treatments, to the exclusion of oils obtained by re-esterification processes and of any mixture with oils of other kinds. It is marketed in accordance with the following designations and definitions: 
#Crude olive pomace oil is olive pomace oil whose characteristics correspond to those fixed for this category in the IOC standard. It is intended for refining for use for human consumption, or for technical use. 
#Refined olive pomace oil is the oil obtained from crude olive pomace oil by refining methods which do not lead to alterations in the initial glyceridic structure. It has a [[Olive oil acidity|free acidity]], expressed as oleic acid, of not more than 0.3 grams per 100 grams and its other characteristics correspond to those fixed for this category in the IOC standard&lt;ref group=note name=R4&gt;This product may only be sold direct to the consumer if permitted in the country of retail sale.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Olive pomace oil is the oil comprising the blend of refined olive pomace oil and virgin olive oils fit for consumption as they are. It has a [[Olive oil acidity|free acidity]] of not more than 1 gram per 100 grams and its other characteristics correspond to those fixed for this category in the IOC standard.&lt;ref group=note name=R5&gt;The country of retail sale may require a more specific designation&lt;/ref&gt; In no case shall this blend be called olive oil.

==IOC Mario Solinas Quality Award==
The IOC Mario Solinas Quality Award was launched in the year 2000 to reward producers, producer associations and packers for excellence and craftsmanship in the production of extra virgin olive oils. A twin aim is to increase consumer awareness and visibility of the wide range of sensory attributes of the superior extra virgin olive oils found on the marketplace.

Entries are classified in different categories according to their fruitiness and evaluated by IOC-recognised panels which use a 100-point profile sheet to rate their smell, taste, retronasal sensations, harmony, complexity and persistence.

The highest scorers are then assessed by an international panel of judges who pick the first, second and third prize winners in each section of the competition.
Winners receive a medal and a diploma. They are also allowed to mention their Award on bottles of extra virgin olive oil belonging to the same batch as the prize winner.

[[Image:Lord Francis Douglas.jpg|thumb|right|Lord Francis Douglas]]

'''Lord Francis William Bouverie Douglas''' (8 February 1847 – 14 July 1865) was a novice British [[mountaineering|mountaineer]]. After sharing in the [[first ascent]] of the [[Matterhorn]], he died in a fall on the way down from the summit.

==Early life==
[[File:Detail, Douglas family Mausoleum, Cummertrees.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Memorial to Lord Francis Douglas (top row) outside the Douglas Family Mausoleum, [[Cummertrees]].]]
Born in [[Scotland]] at [[Cummertrees]], [[Dumfries]], Douglas was the son of [[Archibald Douglas, 8th Marquess of Queensberry|Archibald William Douglas, 8th Marquess of Queensberry]] and his wife [[Caroline Douglas|Caroline]], daughter of General Sir [[Sir William Clayton, 5th Baronet|William Robert Clayton]], Bt. (1786–1866), member of parliament for [[Great Marlow (UK Parliament constituency)|Great Marlow]]. He had an older sister, Lady Gertrude Georgiana Douglas (1842–1893); an older brother, [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|John Sholto Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig]] (1844–1900), later the ninth [[Marquess of Queensberry]]; a younger brother, Lord Archibald Edward Douglas (1850–1938), who became a clergyman; and a younger brother and sister, the twins Lord James Douglas (d. 1891) and [[Lady Florence Dixie|Lady Florence Douglas]] (1855–1905), who married [[Dixie baronets|Sir Alexander Beaumont Churchill Dixie, 11th Baronet]].&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Cokayne ''et al.'', eds., ''The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant'', new edition, 13 volumes in 14 (1910–1959; new edition, 2000), volume X, page 694&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schoolnet&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Fdixie.htm Lady Florence Dixie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320041127/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Fdixie.htm |date=20 March 2008 }} at spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk (accessed 8 March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; He was an uncle of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s lover [[Lord Alfred Douglas]], and a younger brother of [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry]].

In 1858, Douglas's father, Lord Queensberry, died in what was reported as a shooting accident, but his death was widely believed to have been suicide.&lt;ref name=schoolnet/&gt; In 1862, his mother, Lady Queensberry, converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and took her children to live in Paris.&lt;ref name=schoolnet/&gt;

Douglas was educated at the [[Edinburgh Academy]].&lt;ref name=edin&gt;[http://www.edinburghacademy.org.uk/seniorprospectus/alumni/douglas.htm Lord Francis Douglas: First ascent of the Matterhorn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402234743/http://www.edinburghacademy.org.uk/seniorprospectus/alumni/douglas.htm |date=2 April 2008 }} online at edinburghacademy.org.uk (accessed 23 March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triumph and death on the Matterhorn==
{{see also|First ascent of the Matterhorn}}
[[Image:Matterhorn-600px.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[Matterhorn]], {{convert|4478|m|ft|0}}]]

At the beginning of 1865, the [[Matterhorn]] was still unconquered, and more than one assault on it was planned. One such group consisted of Douglas, [[Edward Whymper]], and their guide [[Peter Taugwalder]]. Whymper had already made several unsuccessful attempts on the mountain. On 5 July, this group made the second ascent (and the first by the north-north-west ridge) of the [[Ober Gabelhorn]], a peak of 4,053 metres on the north-west side of the Matterhorn;&lt;ref name=edin/&gt; also in July, Douglas made the first ascent of the nearby Unter Gabelhorn (3,391 m) with guides Peter Taugwalder and P. Inäbnit.&lt;ref&gt;Robin G. Collomb, ''Pennine Alps Central'', London: Alpine Club, 1975, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hearing of a planned assault on the main peak by an Italian party, Douglas and Whymper joined forces with two other British climbers, [[Charles Hudson (climber)|Charles Hudson]] and [[Douglas Robert Hadow]], and their guide [[Michel Croz]].&lt;ref name=pp&gt;[http://www.powell-pressburger.org/Reviews/38_Challenge/Challenge01.html The Matterhorn: Hörnligrat, the north-east ridge] at powell-pressburger.org (accessed 23 March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

At 4:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 13 July, a combined party of seven men, led by Whymper, set off for the Matterhorn under a clear sky: Whymper, Douglas, Hudson and Hadow, plus Taugwalder and son, and Croz. They climbed past the [[Schwarzsee (Zermatt)|Schwarzsee]] to a plateau where they camped. Meanwhile, the Italians, led by Carrel, had camped at a height of about 4000 meters on the Lion Ridge.

On 14 July, Whymper's party proceeded to a successful [[first ascent]] by the Hörnli route. However, on the way down, Hadow fell, knocking down Croz, and also dragging Hudson and Douglas, connected by a rope. The four fell to their deaths on the [[Matterhorn Glacier]] 1,400 metres below. Three of the bodies lost were later found, but not Douglas's.&lt;ref name=pp/&gt;

[[Image:Matterhorn disaster Dore.jpg|thumb|right|220 px|''The Matterhorn Disaster'', depicted by [[Gustave Doré]]]]
Whymper later described the deaths as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldandsold.com/articles13/travel-176.shtml The Lord Francis Douglas Tragedy] by [[Edward Whymper]] online at oldandsold.com (accessed 24 March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|Michael Croz had laid aside his axe, and in order to give Mr. Hadow greater security was absolutely taking hold of his legs and putting his feet, one by one, into their proper positions. As far as I know, no one was actually descending. I can not speak with certainty, because the two leading men were partially hidden from my sight by an intervening mass of rock, but it is my belief, from the movements of their shoulders, that Croz, having done as I have said, was in the act of turning round to go down a step or two himself; at the moment Mr. Hadow slipt, fell against him and knocked him over. I heard one startled exclamation from Croz, then saw him and Mr. Hadow flying downward; in another moment Hudson was dragged from his steps, and Lord Francis Douglas immediately after him. All this was the work of a moment. Immediately we heard Croz's exclamation, old Peter and I planted ourselves as firmly as the rocks would permit; the rope was taut between us, and the jerk came on us both as one man. We held, but the rope broke midway between Taugwalder and Lord Francis Douglas. For a few seconds we saw our unfortunate companions sliding downward on their backs, and spreading out their hands, endeavoring to save themselves. They passed from our sight uninjured, disappeared one by one, and fell from precipice to precipice on to the Matterhorngletscher below, a distance of nearly four thousand feet in height. From the moment the rope broke it was impossible to help them. So perished our comrades! For the space of half an hour we remained on the spot without moving a single step.}}

The rival party of Italian alpinists reached the Matterhorn's summit three days later.

==Aftermath==
The deaths of Douglas, Croz, Hadow and Hudson led to years of recriminations and debate, many blaming Whymper, others suggesting sabotage and even murder. The coroner in [[Zermatt]] (a hotelier) asked few searching questions, and the climbing fraternity was deeply divided over the matter until long after the deaths of all concerned. The incident is seen as marking the end of the [[Golden age of alpinism]].&lt;ref name=ind&gt;Goodwin, Stephen, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970831/ai_n14128249 Matterhorn conqueror cleared over fatal falls] in ''[[The Independent]] dated 31 August 1997, online at findarticles.com (accessed 24 March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rev. Arthur G. Butler was inspired to defend the climbing of the Matterhorn in verse:&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[John Buchan]]'s ''[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500261h.html Lord Minto, a Memoir] (1924) online at gutenberg.net.au (accessed 23 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|We were not what we are&lt;br&gt; Without that other fiery element—&lt;br&gt; The love, the thirst for venture, and the scorn&lt;br&gt; That aught should be too great for mortal powers.}}

40 years after the accident, Lord Francis Douglas's sister still hoped that the remains of her brother could be found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026749/1905-05-14/ed-1/seq-41/#date1=1789&amp;index=8&amp;rows=20&amp;words=Douglas+FrancI+Francis+Lord&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1924&amp;proxtext=Lord+francis+douglas&amp;y=5&amp;x=7&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 The Washington Times May 14, 1905]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mental health professional''' is a [[Health professional|health care practitioner]] or [[Social services|community services]] provider who offers services for the purpose of improving an individual's [[mental health]] or to treat [[mental disorder]]s.  This broad category was developed as a name for community personnel who worked in the new community mental health agencies begun in the 1970s to assist individuals moving from state hospitals, to prevent admissions, and to provide support in homes, jobs, education and community. These individuals (i.e., state office personnel, private sector personnel, and non-profit, now voluntary sector personnel) were the forefront brigade to develop the community programs, which today may be referred to by names such as [[supported housing]], [[psychiatric rehabilitation]], [[Supported employment|supported or transitional employment]], [[sheltered workshop]]s, supported education, [[daily living skills]], affirmative industries, [[dual diagnosis]] treatment, individual and family [[psychoeducation]], [[adult day care]], [[foster care]], [[family services]] and [[mental health counseling]].

The category seldom includes [[psychiatrists]] ([[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]] or [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]]) who remained institutional based and guarded the admissions procedures at institutionalization (both private and state specialty hospitals). However, in 2013, psychiatrists also are working in clinical fields with [[psychologists]] including in sociobehavioral, neurological, person-centered and clinical approaches (often office-based), and studies of the "brain disease" (which came from the community fields and community management and are taught at the MA to PhD level in education). For example, Nat Raskin (at Northwestern University Medical School) who worked with the illustrious Carl Rogers, published on person-centered approaches and therapy in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Raskin, N. (2004). "Client-Centered Therapy and Person-Centered Approaches". UK: PCCD Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The term counselors often refers to office-based professionals who offer therapy sessions to their clients, operated by organizations such as pastoral counseling (which may or may not work with long term services clients) and family counselors. Mental health counselors may refer to counselors working in residential services in the field of mental health in community programs.

==As community professionals==

As Dr. William Anthony, father of psychiatric rehabilitation, described, [[psychiatric nurses]] (RNMH, RMN, CPN), [[clinical psychologists]] (PsyD or PhD), [[social work|clinical social workers]] (MSW or MSSW), [[mental health counselor]]s (MA or MS), professional counselors, [[pharmacists]], as well as many other professionals are often educated in "psychiatric fields" or conversely, educated in a generic community approach (e.v fdcgaxbgcg., human services programs, or health and human services in 2013). However, histxt primary concern is education that leads to a willingness to work with "long-term services and supports" community support&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, W. &amp; Blanch, A. (1994). Research on community support services: What have we learned? "Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal", 12(3): 55-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, W., Cohen, M., Farkas, M. &amp; Gagne, C. (2002). "Psychiatric Rehabilitation". Boston, MA: Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, Sargent College of Medicine and Rehabilitative Services, Boston University.&lt;/ref&gt; in the community to lead to better life quality for the individual, the families and the community.

The community support framework in the US of the 1970s &lt;ref&gt;Carling, P. (1995). "Return to the Community: Building Support Systems for People with Psychiatric Disabilities". NY, NY: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, J., Burchard, S. &amp; Carling, P. (1990). "Clinical Services, Social Adjustment and Worklife in Community Living".  Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1999). Role of family case study research in family policy: Local agency delivery systems. "Policy, Program Evaluation and Research in Disability: Community Support for All." Binghamton, NY: Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is taken-for-granted as the base for new treatment developments (e.g., eating disorders, drug addiction programs) which tend to be free standing clinics for specific "disorders". Typically, the term "mental health professional" does not refer to other categorical disability areas, such as intellectual and developmental disability (which trains its own professionals and maintains its own journals, and US state systems and institutions). Psychiatric rehabilitation has also been reintroduced into the transfer to behavioral health care systems.

==As certified and licensed (across institutions and communities)==

These professionals often deal with the same illnesses, disorders, conditions, and issues (though may separate on site locations, such as hospital or community for the same clientele); however, their [[scope of practice]] differs and more particularly, their positions and roles in the fields of mental health services and systems. The most significant difference between mental health professionals are the laws regarding [[healthcare provider requisites|required education and training]] across the various professions.&lt;ref name="AboutPsychs"&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|title= Difference Between Psychologists and Psychiatrists|accessdate= March 4, 2007|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/psychotherapy/f/psychvspsych.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most significant change has been the Supreme Court Olmstead Decision on the most integrated setting which should further reduce state hospital utilization; yet with new professionals seeking right for community treatment orders and rights to administer medications (original community programs, residents taught to self-administer medications, 1970s).

In 2013, new mental health practitioners are licensed or certified in the community (e.g., PhD, education in private clinical practice) by states, degrees and certifications are offered in fields such as psychiatric rehabilitation (MS, PhD), BA psychology (liberal arts, experimental/clinical/existential/community)to MA licensing is now more popular, BA (to PhD) mid-level program management, qualified civil service professionals, and social workers remain the mainstay of community admissions procedures (licensed by state, often generic training) in the US. Surprisingly, state direction has moved from psychiatry or clinical psychology to community leadership and professionalization of community services management.

Entry level recruitment and training remain a primary concern (since the 1970s, then often competing with fast food positions), and the US Direct Support Workforce includes an emphasis on also training of psychiatric aides, behavioral aides, and addictions aides to work in homes and communities.&lt;ref name=Larson2014&gt;Larson, S. (2014, in press). US Direct Support Workforce. In J. A. Racino, "Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US". NY, NY: CRC Press, Francis and Taylor.&lt;/ref&gt; The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare have new provisions for "self-direction" in services and new options are in place for individual plans for better life outcomes. Community programs are increasingly using health care financing, such as Medicaid, and Mental Health Parity is now law in the US.

&lt;/ref&gt; now operating programs with health care financing in the community. Higher paid medical and health services manager which only operates facilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Medical and Health Services Managers - Summary|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/management/medical-and-health-services-managers.htm|date=8 January 2014|website=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2014-15 Edition|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor: Bureau of Labor Statistics}}
&lt;/ref&gt; considered to be easier than dispersed services management in the community for long-term services and supports (LTSS) often by disability NGOs or state governments (civil service).

The Mental Health Professional Class has often not been included in these occupational schemas in which Occupational Handbooks often separate Human Service Management Classes and Professional Classes from the term Health Care. Common salary ranges are in the $30,000-40,000 for the higher professional at the small community agency. The professionals are considered to be part of the federal Health and Human Services professions. Their responsibilities at the high gates are greater than a psychiatrist assistant who is responsible, to date, only to the psychiatrist. The occupational therapist is considered as an aide to that professional level, as is a behavioral specialist as hired by the agency and the nurse practitioner. Mental health workers in the community (E.g., workers with the homeless, in homes, families and jails, community programs such as group homes) may still be termed Community Support Workers with diverse degrees and qualifications [US Direct Support Professional Workforce].

Children's professionals in the field of mental health include inclusion educators (over $80,000 at the PhD levels) who have been cross-educated in the fields, and "residential treatment" personnel which need dual reviews of credentials (child care, family support, child welfare, independent living, special education and home life, residential skills training programs).

===Treatment diversity and community mental health===

Mental health professionals exist to improve the mental health of individuals, couples, families and the community-at-large. [In this generic use, mental health is available to the entire population, similar to the use by mental health associations.]  Because mental health covers a wide range of elements, the scope of practice greatly varies between professionals.  Some professionals may enhance relationships while others treat specific mental disorders and illness; still others work on population-based health promotion or prevention activities.  Often, as with the case of psychiatrists and psychologists, the scope of practice may overlap often due to common hiring and promotion practices by employers.

As indicated earlier, community mental health professionals have been involved in beginning and operating community programs which include ongoing efforts to improve life outcomes, originally through long term services and supports (LTSS). Termed functional or competency-based programs, these service also stressed decision making and self-determination or empowerment as critical aspects. Community mental health professionals may also serve children which have different needs, as do families, including family therapy, financial assistance and support services. Community mental health professionals serve people of all ages from young children with autism, to children with emotional (or behavioral) needs, to grandma who has Alzheimer's or dementia and is living at home after dad passes away.

Most qualified mental health professionals will refer a [[patient]] or [[wiktionary:Client|client]] to another professional if the specific type of [[Mental illness#Treatment|treatment]] needed is outside of their scope of practice. The main community concern is "zero rejection" from community services for individuals who have been termed "hard to serve" in the population ["schizophrenia"] ["dual diagnosis"] or who have additional needs such as mobility and sensory impairments. Additionally, many mental health professionals may sometimes work together using a variety of treatment options such as concurrent [[psychiatric medication]] and [[psychotherapy]] and [[supported housing]].  Additionally, specific mental health professionals may be utilized based upon their cultural and religious background or experience, as part of a theory of both alternative medicines and of the nature of helping and ethnicity.

Primary care providers, such as internists, pediatricians, and family physicians, may provide initial components of mental health diagnosis and treatment for children and adults; however, family physicians in some states refuse to even prescribe a psychotropic medication deferring to separately funded "medication management" services. Community programs in the categorical field of mental health were designed (1970s) to have a personal family physician for every client in their programs, except for institutional settings and nursing facilities which have only one or two for a large facility (1980, 2013).

In particular, family physicians are trained during residency in interviewing and diagnostic skills, and may be quite skilled in managing conditions such as [[ADHD]] in children and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] in adults. Likewise, many (but not all) pediatricians may be taught the basic components of ADHD diagnosis and treatment during residency. In many other circumstances, primary care physicians may receive additional training and experience in mental health diagnosis and treatment during their practice years.

=== Relative effectiveness ===

Both primary care physicians (GP's) and psychiatrist are just as effective (in terms of remission rates) for the treatment of depression &lt;ref&gt;https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-of-resistant-depression&lt;/ref&gt;. However, treatment resistant depression, suicidal, homicidal ideation, psychosis and catatonia should be handled by mental health specialists. Treatment resistant depression (or treatment refractory depression) refers to depression which remains at large after at least two antidepressant medications have been trailed on their own.

=== Peer workers ===

Some think that mental health professionals are less credible when they have personal experience of mental health. In fact, the mental health sector goes out of its way to hire people with mental illness experience. Those in the mental health workforce with a personal experience of mental health are referred to as ‘peer (support) workers’. The balance of evidence appears to favour their employment:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc = 3363389|year = 2012|author1 = DAVIDSON L|title = Peer support among persons with severe mental illnesses: A review of evidence and experience|journal = World Psychiatry |volume = 11|issue = 2|pages = 123–128|author2 = BELLAMY C|author3 = GUY K|author4 = MILLER R|pmid = 22654945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randomised controlled trials consistently demonstrate peer staff produce outcomes on par with non-peer staff in ancillary roles, but they actually perform better in reducing hospitalisation rates, engaging clients who are difficult to reach, and cutting substance use. There is research that indicates peer workers cultivate a perception among service users that the service is more responsive to non-treatment things, increases their hope, family satisfaction, self-esteem and community belonging

==Psychiatrists and clinical psychology==
{{Main|Psychiatrist|Psychiatry}}
Psychiatrists are [[physician]]s and one of the few professionals in the mental health industry who specialize and are certified in treating [[mental illness]] using the biomedical approach to mental disorders including the use of [[Psychiatric medications|medications]]. However, biological, genetic and social processes as part of premedicine have been the basis of education in fields such as BA psychology since the 1970s, and in 2013, such academic degrees also may include extensive work on the status of brain, DNA research and its applications.[See, Cornell University, Liberal Arts, College of Arts and Sciences, endowed institution in the US] Clinical psychologists were hired by states and served in institutions in the US, and were involved in the transition to community systems.

Psychiatrists may also go through significant training to conduct [[psychotherapy]] and [[Cognitive therapy|cognitive behavioral therapy]]; however psychologists and clinical psychologists specialize in the research and clinical application of these techniques.  The amount of training a psychiatrist holds in providing these types of therapies varies from program to program and also differs greatly based upon region. [Cognitive therapy also stems from cognitive rehabilitation techniques, and may involve long-term community clients with brain injuries seeking jobs, education and community housing.] In the 1970s, psychiatrists were considered to be hospital-based, assessment, and clinical education personnel which were not involved in establishing community programs. They were often criticized for serving the "young, white, urban, professional" as their main clientele groups, though piloting services such as hospital social day care which are now in senior programs.

===Specialties of psychiatrists===
As part of their evaluation of the patient, psychiatrists are one of only a few mental health professionals who may conduct physical examinations, order and interpret laboratory tests and [[EEG]]s, and may order brain imaging studies such as [[Computed tomography|CT]] or [[Computed tomography|CAT]], [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scanning. A medical professional must evaluate the patient for any medical problems or diseases that may be the cause of the mental illness.

Historically psychiatrists have been the only mental health professional with the power to prescribe medication to treat specific types of mental illness. Currently, [[Physician Assistant]]s responsible to the psychiatrist (in lieu of and supervised)and [[nurse practitioner|advanced practice psychiatric nurses]] may prescribe medications, including [[psychiatric medication]]s. Clinical psychologists have gained the ability to prescribe psychiatric medications on a limited basis in a few U.S. states after completing additional training and passing an examination.

===Educational requirements for psychiatrists===
Typically the requirements to become a psychiatrist are substantial but differ from country to country.&lt;ref name=UKReq&gt;The Royal College of Psychiatrists. (2005). ''Careers info for School leavers''.  Retrieved March 25, 2007, from {{cite web|url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/training/careersinpsychiatry/careerbooklet.aspx |title=Career Booklet| accessdate=May 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709051515/http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/training/careersinpsychiatry/careerbooklet.aspx |archivedate=July 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USReq&gt;Psychiatry.com (Unknown last update).

In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] one must first complete a [[Bachelor's degree]].&lt;ref name=USReq /&gt; Students may typically decide any major subject of their choice, however they must enroll in specific courses, usually outlined in a [[Pre-medical|pre-medical program]].&lt;ref name=USReq /&gt; One must then apply to and attend 4 years of [[medical school]] in order to earn his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] or [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|DO]] and to complete his [[Medical education in the United States|medical education]].&lt;ref name=USReq /&gt; Psychiatrists must then pass three successive rigorous national board exams (United States Medical Licensing Exams "USMLE", Steps 1, 2, and 3), which draws questions from all fields of medicine and surgery, before gaining an unrestricted license to practice medicine. Following this, the individual must complete a four-year residency in Psychiatry [[Residency (medicine)|as a psychiatric resident]] and sit for annual national in-service exams. Psychiatry residents are required to complete at least four post-graduate months of internal medicine (pediatrics may be substituted for some or all of the internal medicine months for those planning to specialize in child and adolescent psychiatry) and two months of neurology, usually during the first year,&lt;ref name=USReq /&gt; but some programs require more. Occasionally, some prospective psychiatry residents will choose to do a transitional year internship in medicine or general surgery, in which case they may complete the two months of neurology later in their residency. After completing their training, psychiatrists take written and then oral specialty board examinations.&lt;ref name=USReq /&gt;  The total amount of time required to qualify in the field of psychiatry in the United States is typically 4 to 5 years after obtaining the MD or DO (or in total 8 to 9 years minimum). Many psychiatrists pursue an additional 1–2 years in subspecialty fellowships on top of this such as child psychiatry, geriatric psychiatry, and psychosomatic medicine.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], and most Commonwealth countries, the initial degree is the combined [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery]],&lt;ref name=UKReq /&gt; usually a single period of academic and clinical study lasting around five years. This degree is most often abbreviated 'MBChB', 'MB BS' or other variations, and is the equivalent of the American 'MD'. Following this the individual must complete a two-year foundation programmer&lt;ref name=UKReq /&gt; that mainly consists of supervised paid work as a [[Foundation House Officer]] within different specialties of medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/specialtytraining/students/trainingpathways/foundationtraining.aspx RCP - Foundation Training] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218221423/http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/specialtytraining/students/trainingpathways/foundationtraining.aspx |date=February 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion the individual can apply for "core specialist training" in psychiatry, which mainly involves supervised paid work as a [[Specialty Registrar]] in different subspecialities of psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/specialtytraining/students/trainingpathways/coretraining.aspx RCP - Core Training] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608080116/http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/specialtytraining/students/trainingpathways/coretraining.aspx |date=June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After three years there is an examination for Membership of the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] (abbreviated [[MRCPsych]]), with which an individual may then work as a "[[Staff grade]]" or "Associate Specialist" psychiatrist, or pursue an academic psychiatry route via a [[PhD]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/specialtytraining/careersinpsychiatry/careersinfoforugs.aspx RCP - Careers Info] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208051543/http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/specialtytraining/careersinpsychiatry/careersinfoforugs.aspx |date=December 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If, after the MRCPsych, an additional 3 years of specialization known as "advanced specialist training" are taken (again mainly paid work), and a [[Certificate of Completion of Training]] is awarded, the individual can apply for a post taking independent clinical responsibility as a "[[Consultant (medicine)|consultant]]" psychiatrist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/specialtytraining/students/trainingpathways/highertraining.aspx RCP - Higher Training] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707055144/http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/specialtytraining/students/trainingpathways/highertraining.aspx |date=July 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical psychologist==
{{Main|Clinical psychology}}
A clinical psychologist studies and applies [[psychology]] for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically-based distress or dysfunction and to promote subjective well-being and personal development. In many countries it is a regulated profession that addresses moderate to more severe or chronic psychological problems, including diagnosable [[mental illness|mental disorders]]. Clinical psychology includes a wide range of practices, such as research, psychological assessment, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration. Central to clinical psychology is the practice of [[psychotherapy]], which uses a wide range of techniques to change thoughts, feelings, or behaviors in service to enhancing subjective well-being, mental health, and life functioning. Unlike other mental health professionals, psychologists are trained to conduct [[psychological assessment]]. Clinical psychologists can work with individuals, couples, children, older adults, families, small groups, and communities.

===Specialties of clinical psychologists===
Clinical psychologists who focus on treating mental health specialize in evaluating patients and providing psychotherapy. They do not prescribe medication as this is a role of a psychiatrist (physician who specializes in psychiatry). There are a wide variety of therapeutic techniques and perspectives that guide practitioners, although most fall into the major categories of [[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|Psychodynamic]], [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|Cognitive Behavioral]], [[existential psychotherapy|Existential]]-[[Humanistic psychology|Humanistic]], and [[Systemic Therapy|Systems Therapy]] (e.g. [[Family therapy|family]] or couples therapy).

In addition to therapy, clinical psychologists are also trained to administer and interpret psychological personality tests such as the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory|MMPI]] and the [[Rorschach inkblot test]], and various standardized tests of intelligence, memory, and [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] functioning. Common areas of specialization include: [[Mental illness|specific disorders]] (e.g. [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]), [[Clinical neuropsychology|neuropsychological disorders]], [[Child psychopathology|child and adolescent]], [[Family therapy|family]] and [[relationship counseling]]. Internationally, psychologists are generally not granted prescription privileges. In the US, [[Prescriptive authority for psychologists movement|prescriptive rights]] have been granted to appropriately trained psychologists only in the states of New Mexico and Louisiana, with some limited prescriptive rights in Indiana and the US territory of Guam.&lt;ref name=Prescribing/&gt;

===Educational requirements for clinical psychologists===
{{Main|Training and licensing of clinical psychologists}}
Clinical psychologists, having completed an [[undergraduate degree]] usually in psychology or other [[social science]], generally undergo specialist postgraduate training lasting at least two years (e.g. Australia), three years (e.g. UK), or four to six years depending how much research activity is included in the course (e.g. US). In countries where the course is of shorter duration, there may be an informal requirement for applicants to have undertaken prior work experience supervised by a clinical psychologist, and a proportion of applicants may also undertake a separate [[PhD]] research degree.

Today, in the U.S., about half of licensed psychologists are trained in the [[Scientist-Practitioner Model of Clinical Psychology]] (PhD)—a model that emphasizes both research and clinical practice and is usually housed in universities. The other half are being trained within a [[Psy.D.|Practitioner-Scholar Model of Clinical Psychology]] (PsyD), which focuses on practice (similar to professional degrees for medicine and law).&lt;ref name="norcrosspsyd"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Norcross J. |author2=Castle P. | year = 2002 | title = Appreciating the PsyD: The Facts | url = http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_171.asp | archive-url = https://archive.is/20060927062930/http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_171.asp | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2006-09-27 | journal = Eye on Psi Chi | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 22–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A third training model called the Clinical Scientist Model emphasizes training in clinical psychology research. Outside of coursework, graduates of both programs generally are required to have had 2 to 3 years of supervised clinical experience, a certain amount of personal psychotherapy, and the completion of a dissertation (PhD programs usually require original quantitative empirical research, whereas the PsyD equivalent of dissertation research often consists of literature review and qualitative research, theoretical scholarship, program evaluation or development, critical literature analysis, or clinical application and analysis).

===Continuing Education Requirements for Clinical Psychologists===
Most states in the US require clinical psychologists to obtain a certain number of continuing education credits in order to renew their license.  This was established to ensure that psychologists stay current with information and practices in their fields. The license renewal cycle varies, but renewal is generally required every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Clinical Psychology: Integrating Science and Practice|year=2008|publisher=Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-41499-5|author=Freeman, Arthur, Stephanie H. Felgoise, and Denise D. Davis}}&lt;!--|accessdate=14 April 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of continuing education credits required for clinical psychologists varies between states.  In Nebraska, psychologists are required to obtain 24 hours of approved continuing education credits in the 24 months before their license renewal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nebraska Department of Health &amp; Human Services|url=http://dhhs.ne.gov/publichealth/Pages/crl_mhcs_psych_psychlicense.aspx#Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In California, the requirement is for 36 hours of credits.  New York State does not have any continuing education requirements for license renewal at this time (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CE4Less|url=http://ce4less.com//WillMyStateAccept.aspx?st=New%20York&amp;org=Psychologist|work=CEU Requirements for Psychologists in New York|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities that count towards continuing education credits generally include completing courses, publishing research papers, teaching classes, home study, and attending workshops.  Some states require that a certain number of the education credits be in ethics.  Most states allow psychologists to self-report their credits but randomly audit individual psychologists to ensure compliance.

==Counseling psychologist or psychotherapist==
{{Main|Psychotherapy|Counseling psychology}}

[[Counseling]] generally involves helping people with what might be considered "normal" or "moderate" psychological problems, such as the feelings of anxiety or sadness resulting from major life changes or events.&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;Brain, Christine. (2002). ''Advanced psychology : applications, issues and perspectives.'' Cheltenham : Nelson Thornes. {{ISBN|0-17-490058-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="compass"&gt;Compass, B. &amp; Gotlib, I. (2002). ''Introduction to Clinical Psychology.'' New York, NY : McGraw Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-012491-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, counseling psychologists often help people adjust to or cope with their environment or major events, although many also work with more serious problems as well.

One may practice as a counseling psychologist with a PhD or EdD, and as a counseling psychotherapist with a [[master's degree]]. Compared with clinical psychology, there are fewer counseling psychology graduate programs (which are commonly housed in departments of education), counselors tend to conduct more vocational assessment and less projective or objective assessment, and they are more likely to work in public service or university clinics (rather than hospitals or private practice).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Norcross John | year = 2000 | title = Clinical versus counseling psychology: What's the diff? | url = http://www.psichi.org/?page=051EyeFall00bNorcros | journal = Eye on Psi Chi | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 20–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these differences, there is considerable overlap between the two fields and distinctions between them continue to fade.

[[Mental health counselor]]s and [[Community counseling|residential counselor]]s are also the name for another class of counselors or mental health professionals who may work with long-term services and supports (LTSS) clients in the community. Such counselors may be advanced or senior staff members in a community program, and may be involved in developing skill teaching, active listening (and similar psychological and educational methods), and community participation programs. They also are often skilled in on-site intervention, redirection and emergency techniques. Supervisory personnel often advance from this class of workers in community programs.

==Behavior analysts and community/institutional roles==
{{Main|Professional practice of behavior analysis}}

Behavior analysts are licensed in five states to provide services for clients with [[substance abuse]], [[developmental disabilities]], and [[mental illness]]. This profession draws on the evidence base of [[applied behavior analysis]], [[behavior therapy]], and the philosophy of [[behaviorism]]. Behavior analysts have at least a master's degree in [[behavior analysis]] or in a mental health related discipline as well as at least five core courses in applied behavior analysis (narrow focus in psychological education). Many behavior analysts have a doctorate. Most programs have a formalized internship program and several programs are offered online. Most practitioners have passed the examination offered by the behavior analysis certification board&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bacb.com|title=Behavior Analyst Certification Board|author=|date=|website=www.bacb.com|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=September 2014}} or the examination in clinical behavior therapy by the World Association for Behavior Analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html |title=WCBA|accessdate=January 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110222511/http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html |archivedate=January 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The model licensing act for behavior analysts can be found at the [[Association for Behavior Analysis International]]'s website.

Behavior analysts (who grew from the definition of mental health as a behavioral problem) often use community situational activities, life events, functional teaching, community "reinforcers", family and community staff as intervenors, and structured interventions as the base in which they may be called upon to provide skilled professional assistance. Approaches that are based upon person-centered approaches have been used to update the stricter, hospital based interventions used by behavior analysts for applicability to community environments &lt;ref&gt;Holburn, S. &amp; Vietze, P.M. (2002). "Person-Centered Planning: Research, Practice and Service Directions". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral approaches have often been infused with efforts at client self-determination, have been aligned with community lifestyle planning, and have been criticized as "aversive technology" which was "outlawed" in the field of severe disabilities in the 1990s.

==Certified Mental Health Professional==
The Certified Mental Health Professional (CMHP) certification is designed to measure an individual’s competency in performing the following job tasks. The job tasks are a sampling of job tasks with a clinical emphasis, and represents a level of line staff in community programs reporting to a community supervisor in a small site based program.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2000). Preparing personnel in disability and community life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support." Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Personnel in community housing, nursing facilities, and institutional programs may be covered by these kinds of certifications.

#Maintain confidentiality of records relating to clients’ treatment (and daily affairs as desired by the person).
#Encourage clients to express their feelings, discuss what is happening in their lives, and help them to develop insight into themselves and their relationships.
#Guide clients in the development of skills and strategies for dealing with their problems (and desired life outcomes).
#Prepare and maintain all required treatment (and/or community service)records and reports.
#Counsel clients and patients, individually and in group sessions, to assist in overcoming dependencies (seeking new relationships), adjusting to life, and making changes.
#Collect information about clients through interviews, observations, and tests (and most importantly, speaking with and planning with the person).
#Act as the client’s advocate in order to coordinate required services or to resolve emergency problems in crisis situations. [often first line of emergency response]
#Develop and implement treatment (or "person-centered") plans based on clinical (and community) experience and knowledge.
#Collaborate with other staff members to perform clinical assessments (and health may be contracted for specific consultations) and develop treatment (service) plans.
#Evaluate client’s physical or mental condition (plan, not condition)based on review of client information. [Evaluate outcomes as planned with the client on a "quarterly basis".]

However, these position levels have undergone decades of academic field testing and recommendations with new competencies in development in 2011-2013 by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare (at the categorical aide levels). New professionals were recommended with a community services coordinator (commonly known as "hands on" case management), together with services and personnel management, and community development and liaison roles for community participation.

==School psychologist and inclusion educators==
{{Main|School psychology}}
School psychologists' primary concern is with the academic, social, and emotional well-being of children within a scholastic environment. Unlike clinical psychologists, they receive much more training in education, child development and behavior, and the psychology of learning, often graduating with a post-master's [[Educational specialist|educational specialist degree]] (EdS), EdD or [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) degree. Besides offering individual and group therapy with children and their families, school psychologists also evaluate school programs, provide cognitive assessment, help design prevention programs (e.g. reducing drops outs), and work with teachers and administrators to help maximize teaching efficacy, both in the classroom and systemically.&lt;ref&gt;Silva, Arlene. (2003). ''[http://www.nasponline.org/about_sp/whatis.aspx Who Are School Psychologists?]''. National Association of School Psychologists.&lt;/ref&gt;

In today's world, the school psychologist remains the responsible party in "mental health" regarding children with emotional and behavioral needs, and have not always met these needs in the regular school environment. Inclusion (special)educators support participation in local school programs and after school programs, including new initiatives such as Achieve my Plan by the Research and Training Center on Family Support and Children's Mental Health at Portland State University.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, J., Geenen, S., Thorne, E., &amp; Powers, L. (2009). Improving outcomes through interventions that increase youth empowerment and self determination. "Focal Point: Youth Empowerment and Participation in Health Care". Portland, OR: Research and Training Center on Family Support and Children's Mental Health.&lt;/ref&gt;  Referrals to residential schools and certification of the personnel involved in the residential schools and campuses have been a multi-decade concern with counties often involved in national efforts to better support these children and youth in local schools, families, homes and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Stroul, B. (1996). "Children's Mental Health: Creating Systems of Care in a Changing Society." Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychiatric rehabilitation==
{{Main|Psychiatric rehabilitation}}
[[Psychiatric rehabilitation]], similar to cognitive rehabilitation, is a designated field in the rehabilitation often academically prepared in either Schools of Allied Health and Sciences (near the field of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation) and as rehabilitation counseling in the School of Education. Both have been developed specifically as preparing community personnel (at the MA and PHD levels) and to aid in the transition to professionally competent and integrated community services. Psychiatric rehabilitation personnel have a [[community integration]]-related base, support a recovery and skills-based model of mental health, and may be involved with community programs based upon normalization and social role valorization throughout the US. Psychiatric rehabilitation personnel have been involved in upgrading the skills of staff in institutions in order to move clients into the community settings. Most common in international fields are community rehabilitation personnel which traditionally come from the rehabilitation counseling or community fields. In the new "rehabilitation centers" (new campus buildings), designed similar to hospital "rehab" (physical and occupational therapy, sports medicine), often no designated personnel in the fields of mental health (now "senior behavioral services" or "residential treatment units"). Psychiatric rehabilitation textbooks are currently on the market &lt;ref&gt;Spaniol, R., Brown, M.A., Blankertz, L., Burnham, D.J., Dincin, J., Furlong-Norman, K., Nesbitt, N., Ottenstein, P., Prieve, K., Rutman, I., &amp; Zipple, A. (1994).  "An Introduction to Psychiatric Rehabilitation".

Psychiatric rehabilitation professionals (and psychosocial services)are the mainstay of community programs in the US, and the national service providers association itself may certify mental health staff in these areas. Psychiatric interventions which vary from behavioral ones are described in a review on their use in "residential, vocational, social or educational role functioning" as a "preferred methods for helping individuals with serious psychiatric disabilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farkas|first1=M|last2=Anthony|first2=W|title=Psychiatric rehabilitation interventions: A review|journal=[[International Review of Psychiatry]] |date=April 2010|volume=22|issue=2|pages=114–129|doi=10.3109/09540261003730372|pmid=20504052}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other competencies in education may involve working with families, user-directed planning methods and financing, housing and support, personal assistance services, transitional or supported employment, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), supported housing, integrated approaches (e.g., substance use, or intellectual disabilities), and psychosocial interventions, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, S., Racino, J. &amp; Shoultz, B. (1991). "Psychiatric Rehabilitation." Graduate course in rehabilitation counseling. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, rehabilitation counselors (PhD, MS) may also be educated "generically" (breadth and depth) or for all diagnostic groups, and can work in these fields; other personnel may have certifications in areas such as supported employment which has been verified for use in psychiatric, neurological, traumatic brain injury, and intellectual disabilities, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wehman|first1=P|last2=Revell|first2=G|last3=Kregel|first3=J|last4=Kreutzer|first4=J|last5=Callahan|first5=M|last6=Banks|first6=D|title=Supported employment: An alternative model for vocational rehabilitation of persons with neurologic, psychiatric, or physical disabilities|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|date=February 1991|volume=72|issue=2|pages=101–105|pmid=1991008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social worker==
{{Main|Social work|Mental health#Social Work in Mental Health}}
Social workers in the area of mental health may assess, treat, develop treatment plans, provide case management and/or rights advocacy to individuals with mental health problems.  They can work independently or within clinics/service agencies, usually in collaboration with other health care professionals.

In the US, they are often referred to as clinical social workers; each state specifies the responsibilities and limitations of this profession.  State licensing boards and national certification boards require clinical social workers to have a master's or doctoral degree (MSW or DSW/PhD) from a university. The doctorate in social work requires submission of a major original contribution to the field in order to be awarded the degree.

In the UK there is a now a standardized three-year undergraduate social work degree, or two-year postgraduate master's for those who already have an undergraduate social sciences degree or others and relevant work experience. These courses include mandatory supervised work experience in social work, which may include mental health services. Successful completion allows an individual to register and work as a qualified social worker. There are various additional optional courses for gaining qualifications specific to mental health, for example training in psychotherapy or, in England and Wales, for the role of [[Approved Mental Health Professional]] (two years' training for a legal role in the assessment and detention of eligible mentally disordered people under the [[Mental Health Act 1983|Mental Health Act (1983)]] as amended in 2007).

Social workers in England and Wales are now able to become Approved Clinicians under the [[Mental Health Act 2007]] following a period of further training (likely at postgraduate degree/diploma or doctoral level).  Historically, this role was reserved for [[psychiatrist]] medical doctors, but has now extended to registered mental health professionals, such as [[social workers]], [[psychologists]] and mental health nurses.

In general, it is the psycho-social model rather than, or in addition to, the dominant medical model, that is the underlying rationale for mental health social work. This may include a focus on social causation, labeling, critical theory and social constructiveness. Many argue social workers need to work with medical and health colleagues to provide an effective service but they also need to be at the forefront of processes that include and empower service users.&lt;ref&gt;Golightley, M. (2004) ''Social work and Mental Health'' Learning Matters, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

Social workers also prepare social work administration and may hold positions in human services systems as administration or Executives to Administration in the US. Social workers, similar to psychiatric rehabilitation, updates its professional education programs based upon current developments in the fields (e.g., support services)and serve a multicultural client base.&lt;ref&gt;Drachman, D. &amp; Paulino, A. (2004). "Immigrants and Social Work: Thinking Beyond the Borders of the United States". NY, NY: Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metteri, A., Kroger, T., Pohjola, A., &amp; Rauhala, P. (2004). "Social Work Approaches in Health and Mental Health from 
Around the World." London: The Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational Requirements for Social Workers===
In the United States, the minimum requirement for social workers is generally a bachelor's degree in social work, though a bachelor's degree in a related field such as sociology or psychology may qualify an applicant for certain jobs.  Higher-level jobs typically require a master's degree in social work. Master’s programs in social work usually last two years and consist of at least 900 hours of supervised instruction in the field.&lt;ref name="US Bureau of Labor Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Workers - How to Become a Social Worker|website=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2014-15 Edition|date=8 January 2014|publisher=US Bureau of Labor Statistics|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/social-workers.htm#tab-4|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulatory boards generally require that degrees be obtained from programs that are accredited by the Council of Social Work Education (CSWE) or another nationally recognized accrediting agency for promotion and future collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About licensing and regulation|website=Association of Social Work Boards|url=http://www.aswb.org/licensees/about-licensing-and-regulation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before social workers can practice, they are required to meet the licensing, certification, or registration requirements of the state.  The requirements vary depending on the state but usually involve a minimum number of supervised hours in the field and passing of an exam.&lt;ref name="US Bureau of Labor Statistics"/&gt; All states except California also require pre-licensure from the Association of Social Work Boards (ASWB).

The ASWB offers four categories of social work license. The lowest level is a Bachelors, for which a bachelor's degree in social work is required. The next level up is a Masters and a master's degree in social work is required. The Advanced Generalist category of social worker requires a master's degree in social work and two years of supervised post-degree experience.  The highest ASWB category is a Clinical Social Worker which requires a master's degree in social work along with two years of post-master’s direct experience in social work.

===Continuing Education Requirements for Social Workers===
Most states require social workers to acquire a minimum number of continuing education credits per license, certification, or registration renewal period.  The purpose of these requirements is to ensure that social workers stay up-to-date with information and practices in their professions.  In most states, the renewal process occurs every two or three years.  The number of continuing education credits that is required varies between states but is generally 20 to 45 hours&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CE4Less |url=http://ce4less.com/profession/ |work=Continuing Education Requirements for Mental Health Professionals |accessdate=14 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415213242/http://ce4less.com/profession/ |archivedate=15 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; during the two- or three-year period prior to renewal.

Courses and programs that are approved as continuing education for social workers generally must be relevant to the profession and contribute to the advancement of professional competence.  They often include continuing education courses, seminars, training programs, community service, research, publishing articles, or serving on a panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington State Dept. of Health|url=http://www.doh.wa.gov/LicensesPermitsandCertificates/ProfessionsNewReneworUpdate/SocialWorker/ContinuingEducationInformation.aspx#2|work=WAC 246-809-610|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many states enforce that a minimum amount of the credits be on topics such as ethics, HIV/AIDs, or domestic violence.

==Psychiatric and mental health nurse==
{{Main|Psychiatric and mental health nursing|Psychiatric and mental health nurse practitioner}}
Psychiatric Nurses or Mental Health Nurse Practitioners work with people with a large variety of mental health problems, often at the time of highest distress, and usually within hospital settings.  These professionals work in primary care facilities, outpatient mental health clinics, as well as in hospitals and community health centers. MHNPs evaluate and provide care for patients who have anything from psychiatric disorders, medical mental conditions, to substance abuse problems.  They are licensed to provide emergency psychiatric services, assess the psycho-social and physical state of their patients, create treatment plans, and continually manage their care.  They may also serve as consultants or as educators for families and staff; however, the MHNP has a greater focus on psychiatric diagnosis (typically the province of the MD or PhD), including the differential diagnosis of medical disorders with psychiatric symptoms and on medication treatment for psychiatric disorders.

=== Educational requirements for psychiatric and mental health nurses ===
Psychiatric and mental health nurses receive specialist education to work in this area. In some countries it is required that a full course of general [[nurse]] training be completed prior to specializing as a psychiatric nurse.  In other countries, such as the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]], an individual completes a specific nurse training course that determines their area of work.  As with other areas of nursing, it is becoming usual for psychiatric nurses to be educated to degree level and beyond. Psychiatric aides, now being trained by educational psychology in 2014, are part of the entry level workforce which is projected to be needed in communities in the US in the next decades.&lt;ref name=Larson2014/&gt;

In order to become a nurse practitioner in the U.S., at least six years of college education must be obtained.  After earning the bachelor's degree (usually in nursing, although there are master's entry level nursing graduate programs intended for individuals with a bachelor's degree outside of nursing) the test for license as a registered nurse (the NCLEX-RN) must be passed.  Next, the candidate must complete a state-approved master's degree advanced nursing education program which includes at least 600 clinical hours.  Several schools are now also offering further education and awarding a DNP ([[Doctor of Nursing Practice]]).

Individuals who choose a master's entry level pathway will spend an extra year at the start of the program taking classes necessary to pass the NCLEX-RN.  Some schools will issue a BSN, others will issue a certificate.  The student then continues with the normal MSN program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nurseweb.ucsf.edu/www/spec-psy.htm|title=Home - UCSF School of Nursing|author=|date=|website=nurseweb.ucsf.edu|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acnpweb.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3479.

==Mental health care navigator==
{{main|Mental health care navigator}}
A mental health care navigator is an individual who assists patients and families to find appropriate mental health [[caregivers]], facilities and services. Individuals who are care navigators are often also trained therapists and doctors. The need for mental health care navigators arises from the fragmentation of the mental health industry, which can often leave those in need with more questions than answers. Care navigators work closely with patients through discussion and collaboration to provide information on options and referrals to healthcare professionals, facilities, and organizations specializing in the patients’ needs. The difference between other mental health professionals and a care navigator is that a care navigator provides information and directs a patient to the best help rather than offering diagnosis, prescription of medications or treatment.

Many mental health organizations use “navigator” and “navigation” to describe the service of providing guidance through the health care industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edgren |first1=Faith |title=Mental Health Patient Navigator |url=http://capservices.org/programs/human-development/mental-health-navigator/ |website=CAP Services |accessdate=2 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006111643/http://capservices.org/programs/human-development/mental-health-navigator/ |archivedate=October 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services (Commonwealth of Virginia)|author2=NAMI Virginia|title=Navigating the System: A Guide to Accessing Mental Health Services in Virginia|url=http://namivirginia.org/assets/pdfs/ResourceNavigator.pdf|website=NAMI Virginia|accessdate=2 October 2014|format=PDF|date=20 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006133213/http://namivirginia.org/assets/pdfs/ResourceNavigator.pdf|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Navigation Services|url=http://www.jeffersonmentalhealth.org/Programs/Navigation/navmain.cfm|website=Jefferson Center for Mental Health|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruskay|first1=Molly|title=Navigation Services |url=http://www.mhpcolorado.org/For-Clients-and-Employees/Navigation.aspx|website=Mental Health Partners|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Care navigators are also sometimes referred to as “system navigators”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Napa County Health and Human Services Agency|title=System Navigators|url=http://www.countyofnapa.org/Pages/DepartmentContent.aspx?id=4294967799|website=County of Napa|publisher=County of Napa, CA|accessdate=2 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006215534/http://www.countyofnapa.org/Pages/DepartmentContent.aspx?id=4294967799|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One type of care navigator is an "educational consultant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldberg|first1=Leslie S.|title=Educational Consultant Services (Crystal Ball Not Included)|url=http://www.edconsult.org/educational-consulting-blog/bid/25048/Educational-Consultant-Services-Crystal-Ball-Not-Included|website=Educational Consulting Blog|publisher=The Goldberg Center for Educational Planning|date=23 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workforce Shortage ==
Behavioral health disorders are prevalent in the United States, but accessing treatment can be challenging. Nearly 1 in 5 adults experience a mental health condition for which approximately only 43% received treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality. (2016). Key substance use and mental health indicators in the United States: Results from the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (HHS Publication No. SMA 16-4984, NSDUH Series H-51). Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.samhsa.gov/data/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about access to mental health treatment, two-thirds of primary care physicians reported that they were unable to secure outpatient mental health treatment for their patients.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham PJ. Beyond Parity: Primary Care Physicians' Perspectives On Access To Mental Health Care. ''Health Affairs''. 2009;28(3). {{doi|10.1377/hlthaff.28.3.w490}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is due, in part, to the workforce shortage in behavioral health. In rural areas, 55% of US counties have no practicing psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. Overall, 77% of counties have a severe shortage of mental health workers and 96% of counties had some unmet need.&lt;ref name="Mental Health Services Administration 2013"&gt;Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Report to Congress on the nation’s substance abuse and mental health workforce issues. Rockville (MD): SAMHSA; 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasons for the workforce shortage include high turnover rates, high levels of work-related stress, and inadequate compensation. Annual turnover rate is 33% for clinicians and 23% for clinical supervisors. This is compared to an annual PCP turnover rate of 7.1%. Compensation in behavioral health field is notably low. The average licensed clinical social worker, a position that requires a master's degree and 2000 hours of post graduate experience, earns $45,000/year on average. As a point of reference, the average physical therapist earns $75,000/year on average. Substance abuse counselor earnings are even lower, with an average salary of $34,000/year.&lt;ref name="Mental Health Services Administration 2013"/&gt; Job stress is another factor that may lead to the high turnover rates and workforce shortage. It is estimated that 21-67% of mental health workers experience high levels of burnout including symptoms of emotional exhaustion, high levels of depersonalization and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, G., Salyers, M.P., Rollins, A.L. et al. ''Adm Policy Ment Health'' (2012) 39: 341. {{doi|10.1007/s10488-011-0352-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have offered various recommendations to reduce the critical workforce gaps in behavioral health. Some of these recommendations include the following: expanding loan repayment programs to incentivize mental health providers to work in underserved (often rural) areas, integrating mental health into primary care, and increasing reimbursement to health care professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Olfson, M. (2016). Building the Mental Health Workforce Capacity Needed to Treat Adults with Serious Mental Illnesses, Health Affairs, 35, 983-990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social workers also tend to experience competing work and family demands, which negatively affects their job well-being and subsequently their job satisfaction, resulting in high turnover in the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalliath|first=Parveen|last2=Kalliath|first2=Thomas|last3=Chan|first3=Xi Wen|last4=Chan|first4=Christopher|title=Linking Work–Family Enrichment to Job Satisfaction through Job Well-Being and Family Support: A Moderated Mediation Analysis of Social Workers across India|journal=The British Journal of Social Work|language=en|doi=10.1093/bjsw/bcy022|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5514">The '''National Health Service Central Register''' (NHSCR) is a [[Scottish Government]] database accessible to [[public bodies of Scotland|public bodies]] approved by the [[Scottish Parliament]]. The register was established in the early 1950s to facilitate the transfer of patients between [[NHS Scotland#Health Boards|Health Board]] areas or across borders within the [[countries of the United Kingdom]]. However, its role has expanded over the decades and it now also provides [[Scottish local authorities]] with a unique reference number used to identify people on their own databases.&lt;ref name = NHSCR/&gt;

In 2006, the [[Scottish Government]] and the [[National Records of Scotland]] made a major expansion of the applications of the NHSCR by changing regulations with section 57 of the Local Electoral Administration and Registration Services (Scotland) Act 2006.&lt;ref name = NHSCR&gt;(2015) [http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/nhs-central-register/about-the-register National Health Service Central Register] National Records for Scotland, Retrieved 10 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Scottish Government proposed expanding access to the NHSCR to more than 100 additional public bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-31715798|title=MSPs debate 'super ID database' plans|date=4 March 2015|accessdate=12 March 2015|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion has been criticised by the [[Open Rights Group]], who believe it may breach data protection rules and human rights and resembles a [[national identity system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scottishlegal.com/2015/03/10/privacy-campaigners-may-mount-legal-challenge-against-super-id-database/|title=Privacy campaigners may mount legal challenge against ‘super ID database’|date=10 March 2015|accessdate=12 March 2015|publisher=''Scottish Legal News''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community Health Index==
The '''Community Health Index''' is a register of all patients in [[NHS Scotland]], [[Scotland]]'s [[Publicly-funded health care|publicly funded healthcare system]]. The register exists to ensure that patients can be correctly identified, and that all information pertaining to a patient's [[health]] is available to providers of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The use of the CHI (Community Health Index) across the NHS in Scotland | publisher=[[Scottish Government]] | date=5 June 2012 | url=http://www.ehealth.scot.nhs.uk/wp-content/documents/Health-and-social-care-CHI-Guidance-version-1-1-Strategy-Board-Approved-June-20131.pdf | accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients are identified using a ten-digit number known as the '''CHI Number''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What is the Community Health Index (CHI)? | publisher = Scottish Health Service Centre | date=19 October 2010 | url = http://www.shsc.scot.nhs.uk/upload/file/national_committee_services/chiag/2010_10_19_what_is_the_community_health_index.pdf | accessdate = 28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; pronounced /ˈkaɪ/.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = FAQs on CHI | publisher = eHealth NHS Scotland | date=30 April 2010 | url = http://www.ehealth.scot.nhs.uk/support-documentation/document-holder2/faqs-2/| accessdate = 2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number is normally formed using the patient's date of birth (as DDMMYY), followed by four digits: two digits randomly generated, the third digit identifying [[gender]] at birth (odd for men, even for women) and a [[check digit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Health and Social Care Data Dictionary: Community Health Index (CHI) Number | publisher= [[Information Services Division|ISD Scotland]] |url=http://www.ndc.scot.nhs.uk/Dictionary-A-Z/Definitions/index.asp?Search=C&amp;ID=128&amp;Title=CHI%20Number |date=12 May 2014 |accessdate= 28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2010, uptake of this number (based on radiology requests) varied across Scotland from 96.5% to 99.9% depending on the local NHS Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author= | title= Scotland Performs | publisher= Scottish Government | year = 2010 | url= http://www.gov.scot/About/scotPerforms/partnerstories/NHSScotlandperformance/CHIutilisation | accessdate= 2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''No Secrets''', also known coequally as '''Adult Safeguarding''', was a [[UK Government]] publication from the [[Department of Health]] which provided guidance on developing and implementing multi-agency policies and procedures to protect adults deemed "at risk" from harm and/or [[abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/publicationsandstatistics/publications/publicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4008486 |title=No Secrets: guidance on protecting vulnerable adults in care - Publications - GOV.UK |publisher=Dh.gov.uk |date=2000-03-20 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its full title was "''No secrets'': guidance on developing and implementing multi-agency policies and procedures to protect vulnerable adults from abuse". It has now been replaced by statutory guidance issued under the [[Care Act 2014]].&lt;ref name=guidance&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/care-act-statutory-guidance/care-and-support-statutory-guidance Care and support statutory guidance], accessed 1 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

When the guidance was current, the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] website stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It explains how commissioners and providers of health and social care services should work together to produce and implement local policies and procedures. They should collaborate with the public, voluntary and private sectors and they should also consult service users, their carers and representative groups. Local authority social services departments should co-ordinate the development of policies and procedures."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/no-secrets-guidance-on-protecting-vulnerable-adults-in-care|title=No Secrets: guidance on protecting vulnerable adults in care - Publications - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History of No Secrets==
The No Secrets ([[England]]) and In Safe Hands ([[Wales]]) documents were issued as guidance in 2000, under section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970. Section 7 guidance does not carry the same status as [[legislation]]; instead local authorities have their compliance assessed as part of a statutory [[inspection]] process. With ‘good reason’ a [[local authority]] can ignore such guidance, but may be called upon to justify their actions in a judicial review.

When a referral is made to the [[local authority]] under adult protection / safeguarding, the case is allocated to a qualified social worker or specially trained care manager to undertake and [[:wikt:investigate|investigate]] the allegation of abuse.  The investigation can be a single agency led investigation, often led by the social worker or care manager or multi agency led, either with another statutory body such as the [[police]], [[trading standards]] or a healthcare professional.

==Training of safeguarding social workers==
There is no current national guidance or minimal standards relating to the training of social workers in the UK who investigate Adult Protection / Adult Safeguarding matters.  However, in 2011, [[Keele University]] developed a master's degree in Adult Safeguarding.  The MA in Safeguarding Adults: Law, Policy and Practice &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keele.ac.uk/law/studylaw/postgraduatedegrees/masafeguardingadultslawpolicyandpractice/ |title=MA Safeguarding Adults: Law, Policy and Practice - Keele University |publisher=Keele.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is offered by the School of Law.

A similar such course of study is provided by the Ulster University, in partnership with the Health and Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland. The course is provided at Master's level. There are four modules available regarding various aspects of Social Work practice when safeguarding adults who are at risk of harm. This [https://niscc.info/news/117-social-work-awards-2016-swmakesadifference award winning program] is the only course of its type in the UK and is designed to enable qualified Social Workers to reflect on their practice and work towards gaining academic credits as well as the Specialist Award in the [https://niscc.info/professional-in-practice/professional-in-practice-professional-awards Northern Ireland SW Post Qualifying framework].

==Recent adult protection failures==
There have been several notable cases where severe harm and even death have occurred as a result of local agencies not acting in accordance with the "No Secrets" guidelines such as the [[murder]] of a young man with [[learning disability|learning difficulties]] (Developmental delay).&lt;ref name="dailymail1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-461727/Man-learning-difficulties-tortured-forced-viaduct-death.html |title=Man with learning difficulties 'tortured and forced off viaduct to his death' &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2007-06-13 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cornwall]] Adult protection committee [[serious case review]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/idoc.ashx?docid=1fd6e027-7ef4-4a08-bf58-e55141b79c5b&amp;version=-1 |title=Cornwall Adult Protection Committee : The Murder of Steven Hoskin : A Serious Case Review |publisher=Towerhamlets.gov.uk |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; into Mr Hoskins death referred to No Secrets saying "What is striking about the responses of services to Steven’s circumstances is that each agency focused on single issues within their own sectional [[:wikt:remit|remits]] and did not make the connections deemed necessary for the protection of vulnerable adults and proposed by No Secrets" ([[Home Office]]/ Department of Health 2000).&lt;ref name="dailymail1"/&gt;

==Reasons for such failures==
The main reason for these and other failings ([[Stafford Hospital scandal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/5030012/Staffordshire-hospital-scandal-the-hidden-story.html |title=Staffordshire hospital scandal: the hidden story |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Panting,&lt;ref&gt;[http://safeguardingadultsforum.co.uk/docpload/18112009321312-~-Case_review_in_respect_of_MP%20fire%20and%20rescue.DOC]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826142105/http://safeguardingadultsforum.co.uk/docpload/18112009321312-~-Case_review_in_respect_of_MP%20fire%20and%20rescue.DOC |date=August 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are the fact that these are the only Government documents addressing the development of multi-disciplinary structures for adult protection, and they are only guidelines. although the [[Association of Directors of Social Services]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adass.org.uk/ |title=The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services |publisher=ADASS |date=2013-09-15 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought out what was essentially a [[best practice]] guide called ‘Safeguarding Adults'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adass.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=522:safeguarding-adults-key-documents&amp;catid=125:safeguarding-adults-&amp;Itemid=406 |title=Safeguarding Adults - Key Documents |publisher=Adass.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005. Existing legislation only relates to paid [[social care]]. The majority of abuse happens in people’s own homes, often perpetrated by family, friends or neighbors.  The majority of [[elder abuse]] occurs within the community, and specifically within people’s own homes and is often perpetrated by family members and relatives. In legislative terms however the primary thrust of Government protective policy has focused upon the much smaller number of people in receipt of social care, and this has been regulated primarily through the [[Care Standards Act 2000]] and more latterly the [[Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006]]. Abuse within the community, unless perpetrated by paid domiciliary workers, is addressed through the No Secrets guidance.

===More reasons for failure===
The guidance has been effective in facilitating the creation of some form of adult protection system in all local authority areas, it has failed to deliver on a number of important issues, e.g.there is a lack of consistency and equality across areas in terms of the construction and level of adult protection systems provided, there is variable collaboration across statutory agencies, there are significant [[funding]] and staffing deficiencies in many areas, there is no consistency in the timing and duration of investigations, and there is no power to ensure access to victims, or to ensure safe outcomes. Lack of legislative underpinning - major reason for the inconsistent application of the ‘No Secrets’ guidance. ?Organizations and individuals firstly do what is legally required of them (their statutory duty), and only as a secondary activity consider those matters that fall into the category of a ‘statutory power’ i.e. what they are authorized but not compelled to do. It is argued that there is insufficient funding, and Adult protection work minimal. Some statutory agencies may invest what is necessary to maintain a skeleton response, with other agencies perceiving the work to be optional.

===Final criticisms and a proposed way forward===
Another criticism is [[personalisation]] -empowering people’s choice and control over care through the provision of direct payments or individual [[budget]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/DisabledPeople/financialsupport/DG_10016128 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513024112/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/DisabledPeople/financialsupport/DG_10016128 |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – no effective safeguards being pre-planned or proposed -by accepting a personalisation package someone loses the automatic safeguards of the Care Standards Act 2000 and the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 systems become optional.

There are still many discrepancies with some agencies providing clear policies and procedures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.staffordshire.gov.uk/health/care/reportingabuse/ |title=Staffordshire County Council - Report Adult Abuse |publisher=Staffordshire.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others only functioning at a very basic level.

==Current arrangements==
On the 1st April 2015 the 'No Secrets' guidance document was repealed by the Care Act 2014. This act contains replacement and mandatory requirements specifically around adult safeguarding and guidance now issued has statutory force and effect.&lt;ref name=guidance /&gt;

'''Noksu''' ({{ko-hhrm|hangul=녹수회|hanja=綠樹會}}) is a medical voluntary organization of [[Kyung Hee University]], Seoul, South Korea. The members consist of both students and graduates from [https://web.archive.org/web/20090519001604/http://omc.khu.ac.kr/ College of Oriental Medicine] and [http://khcns21.khu.ac.kr/ College of Nursing Sciences].

* The name 'Noksu' means 'Green Tree' in translation. It represents evergreens to always have interest in public volunteering.

==History==
Founded in 1966, Noksu's main concept of volunteering was to give what we have learned back to the community. Inspired by poor medical SOC in more rural areas of Korea in the 1960s and 1970s, the students and graduates, especially majoring in Korean Medicine, have collaborated within each university to promote public health management. This concept of public service has been widespread since then.

*April, 19th, 1966 - Founding of Noksu Organization

Since the founding of Noksu, every year great number of students who were interested in voluntary service has joined. Noksu has prospered for 45 years accounting for total of 557 members, 49 of which is active undergraduates.

*April, 19th, 2010 - 45th Anniversary of Noksu

Noksu is currently located at College of Oriental Medicine, [[Kyunghee University]], South Korea.

==Guidance==
Noksu is now under guidance of excellent active professors who themselves were undergraduate members of Noksu.

*Founder Professor - Prof. Jun-Jeon Mun (1966~)
*Second Guidance Professor - Prof. Gwang-Ho Kim (~2004)
*Current Guidance Professor - Prof. Seung-Gi Jung &amp; Prof. Myung-Ja Wang (2005~present)
Prof. Seung-Gi Jung is currently the head professor of Allergy &amp; Respiratory Diseases Department at Kyung Hee University Medical Center and a professor at College of Oriental Medicine, Kyung Hee University.
Prof. Myung-Ja Wang is currently a professor at College of Nursing Sciences, Kyung Hee University.

==Motto and song==
Noksu's Motto is "겸손과 사랑으로 진정한 봉사를 이루자". &lt;br /&gt;
In translation, it means "Sincere volunteering through humble hearts."

Noksu's song is as follows.&lt;br /&gt;
1st Verse&lt;br /&gt;
젊음을 부르는 대학가에, 앞날에 희망을 꿈꾸며, 언제나 다정한 그 모습들, 오늘도 모였네 녹수회.&lt;br /&gt;
2nd Verse&lt;br /&gt;
태양이 비치는 백사장에, 언제나 밀려오는 파도처럼, 우리들의 우정도 변치말자, 오늘도 모였네 녹수회.

During each summer and winter break, guidance professors, undergraduate and graduate members of Noksu survey rural districts with poor medical access for candidates. For the district that meets the conditions, extensive medical service is given. The voluntary service lasts for 7  days(including the set-up and dismantling time of temporary clinic). The patients visiting the temporary clinic will receive simple health check-up and [[Traditional Korean Medicine]] Treatments of [[acupuncture]], [[moxabustion]] and [[herbal medicine]]. Also brief lectures are given on common conditions such as hypertension, coronary diseases and diabetes to promote public health awareness.

===Local Medical Volunteer Service===
In course of rapid development of Seoul, the capital of Korea, more suburban areas of the city had fallen behind and left its residents underprivileged in means of SOC. Conscious of these gaps, Noksu has extended its medical volunteering service to local residents of suburban areas of Seoul since 2002. Endowed by Seoul Housing Corporation, Noksu has been able to give brief medical coverage to senior residents living in government funded walfare apartments. Brief check-up includes screening and follow-up tests for hypertension and diabetes. [[Traditional Korean Medicine]] treatment is used to diagnose and treat patients.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4482">'''POPLINE''' (or Population Information Online)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popline.org/about&lt;/ref&gt; is a reproductive health [[Bibliographic database|database]], containing citations with abstracts to scientific articles, reports, books, and unpublished reports in the field of [[population]], [[family planning]], and [[reproductive health]] issues.  POPLINE is maintained by the K4Health Project&lt;ref&gt;http://www.k4health.org&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]]/[[Johns Hopkins University Center for Communication Programs | Center for Communication Programs]], and it is funded by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID). 
==History==
The original database consisted of citations from Popinform, a database maintained from 1973 to 1978 by the Population Information Program (PIP) at [[George Washington University]]. In 1978, the database, along with Population Information Program, moved to the [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Between 1980 and 2001, renamed POPLINE, the database became part of the [[United States National Library of Medicine]]'s (NLM) Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (MEDLARS) along with [[MEDLINE]] and other NLM databases.

Since 2001, POPLINE has been maintained by the Knowledge for Health (K4Health) Project, formerly PIP then INFO, based at the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]]/Center for Communication Programs. Access to POPLINE is available free of charge at its website. Other organizations contributed to POPLINE throughout its history, such as the [[Center for Population and Family Health]] (CPFH) Library/Information Program at [[Columbia University]], Population Index at [[Princeton University]], and the Carolina Population Center (CPC) at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]].

==Coverage==
POPLINE provides more than 370,000 records citing worldwide literature in the area of reproductive health. The majority of items are published from 1970 to the present, but there are selected citations dating back to 1827.  The database adds 12 thousand records annually and is updated weekly.

The database consists of [[Citation|bibliographic citations]] and [[Abstract (summary)|abstracts]] to a variety of materials including journal articles, monographs, technical reports, and unpublished literature.   

Subjects covered internationally include family planning methods and programs, [[fertility]], and population law and policy. Additional subjects covered in reference to developing countries include [[adolescent]] reproductive health, [[demography]], [[environmental health]], gender and health, [[health communication]], [[sexually transmitted infection]]s, maternal and child health, population and environment, and [[women in development]].

==Services==
POPLINE has both basic and advanced searches and offers customized searches provided on request to persons or institutions in developing countries. Full-text copies for most of the documents cited in POPLINE can be requested from users in low-income countries free of charge via mail or sent by email. In addition to free text searching, the database can be searched by keywords from the POPLINE Thesaurus, a controlled vocabulary of 2,400+ terms used to index documents in the database.

==Controversy==
In 2008, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that [[Johns Hopkins University]] had instructed the POPLINE search engine to ignore the search term "abortion", as it ignores search terms such as "a" and "the", in February 2008 in response to pressure from the [[United States Agency for International Development]]. Making the term a [[stop word]] removed the ability of users to search for this common term for a reproductive health issue.

After learning of the restriction on finding abortion-related articles, the dean of the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]], Michael J. Klag, lifted the restriction.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/05/us/05popline.html Health Database Was Set Up to Ignore ‘Abortion’], by Robert Pear. Published in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on April 5, 2008; accessed April 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jhsph.edu/publichealthnews/popline/poplinestatement.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peasant foods''' are dishes specific to a particular culture, made from accessible and inexpensive ingredients, and usually prepared and seasoned to make them more palatable. They often form a significant part of the [[Diet (nutrition)|diets]] of people who live in [[poverty]], or have a lower income compared to the average for their society or country.

Peasant foods have been described as being the diet of [[peasant]]s, that is, [[tenant farmer|tenant]] or poorer farmers and their [[Farmworker|farm workers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=coTiVJiWS00C&amp;pg=PA190 | title=Eating Right in the Renaissance | publisher=University of California Press | author=Albala, Ken | year=2002 | pages=190 | isbn=0520927281}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by extension, of other cash-poor people. They may use ingredients, such as [[offal]] and less-tender cuts of meat, which are not as marketable as a [[cash crop]]. Characteristic recipes often consist of hearty one-dish meals, in which chunks of meat and various vegetables are eaten in a savory broth, with bread or other [[staple food]]. [[Sausage]]s are also amenable to varied readily available ingredients, and they themselves tend to contain offal and grains.

Peasant foods often involve skilled preparation by knowledgeable cooks using inventiveness and skills passed down from earlier generations. Such dishes are often prized as ethnic foods by other cultures and by descendants of the native culture who still desire these traditional dishes.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

It also aims to lessen the impact of the growing number of humans on the environment. The organization helps to educate people  about the benefits of small families, encourages the use of family planning, upholds women's status&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mahb.stanford.edu/blog/two-crises-one-solution-pmc/|title=Population Media Center: Two Crises, One Solution {{!}} MAHB|date=2017-10-19|work=MAHB|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promotes gender equity.

The organization creates long-running serial dramas based on its particular [https://www.populationmedia.org/product/serial-dramas/ entertainment methodology], derived from [[Miguel Sabido]]'s original [[Entertainment-Education]] approach,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.populationmedia.org/2007/08/09/sex-soap-social-change-the-sabido-methodology/|title=Sex, Soap &amp; Social Change - The Sabido Methodology - Population Media Center|date=2007-08-09|work=Population Media Center|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help change attitudes and behavior related to people's health and well-being.  This methodology has been scientifically shown to lead to population-wide behavior change in many countries where it has been implemented, and was spread widely by former PMC board member and advisor [[David Poindexter]].

'''Revenue cycle management''' is the process used by healthcare systems in the United States to track the revenue from patients, from their initial appointment or encounter with the healthcare system to their final payment of balance. The cycle can be defined as, "all administrative and clinical functions that contribute to the capture, management, and collection of patient service revenue."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hfma.org|title=Healthcare Financial Management Association, Online Glossary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a cycle that describes and explains the life cycle of a patient (and subsequent revenue and payments) through a typical healthcare encounter from admission (registration) to final payment (or adjustment off of [[accounts receivable]]s). 

==Information==
The revenue cycle management process begins when a patient schedules an appointment and it ends when the healthcare provider has accepted all payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/about/services/patient-business-services/revenue-cycle/ |title=Revenue Cycle &amp;#124; Patient Business Services &amp;#124; OHSU |publisher=Ohsu.edu |date=2013-04-16 |accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Errors in revenue cycle management can lead to the healthcare provider receiving delayed payments or no payment at all. Because the revenue cycle process is complex and subject to regulatory oversight, healthcare providers can turn over their revenue cycle management to companies that handle this complex process 24/7 with specialized agents and proprietary technologies to manage healthcare provider revenue cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/ahima/bok1_049996.hcsp?dDocName=bok1_049996 |title=Show Me the Money... A Look at the Revenue Cycle from the Billing Perspective |publisher=Library.ahima.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical billing is getting increasingly more complicated, especially as medical code guidelines are making the switch from ICD-9 to ICD-10. Proper revenue cycle management ensures that billing errors are reduced so that reimbursements from the insurance companies are maximized. Revenue cycle management teams are responsible for maintaining compliance with coding regulations, such as the [[ICD-10 Procedure Coding System|ICD-10]] code update. Using the right coding for services rendered by a practice ensures that insurance claims can be processed and that the practitioner is compensated for all of their services rendered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/ahima/bok1_035391.hcsp?dDocName=bok1_035391]&lt;/ref&gt; A revenue cycle management team is able to handle this, rather than having the doctor take care of patients and learn new medical coding protocols.

In 2014 the revenue cycle management market was valued at $18.3 billion and is expected to grow to $32.2 billion by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/25-things-to-know-in-revenue-cycle-management.html|title=25 things to know in revenue cycle management|last=Murphy|first=Brooke|website=www.beckershospitalreview.com|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For remittance received in 2014, the average physician practice took 18 days to generate a claim after the date of service and had an 11% denial rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bermender|first1=Jeremy|title=Revenue Cycle Management|url=https://remitdata.com/solutions-old/improve-revenue-healthcare-providers/|website=Remit Data|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revenue cycle management is often considered a segment of the greater healthcare IT industry which includes [[Hospital information system|HIS]], [[Radiology information system|RIS]], [[Electronic health record|EHR]], [[Picture archiving and communication system|PACS]], [[Computerized physician order entry|CPOE]], [[Visiting Nurse Association|VNA]], [[mHealth]], [[Health care analytics|healthcare analytics]], [[telehealth]], [[supply chain management]], [[Customer relationship management|CRM]], [[fraud management]], and [[claims management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.medgadget.com/2016/10/healthcare-it-market-size-worth-over-230bn-by-2023-global-market-insights-inc.html|title=Healthcare IT Market size worth over $230bn by 2023: Global Market Insights Inc. {{!}}|date=2016-10-19|newspaper=Medgadget|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bhmpc.com/2015/08/common-revenue-cycle-management-pitfalls-to-avoid/|title=Common Revenue Cycle Management Pitfalls to Avoid|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Registration==
The first function within the revenue cycle is the registration function, which allows the service provider to obtain all of the necessary data needed in order to properly bill an insurance company (per the ANSI 837 5010 standards and requirements).  Clerical errors that are made within patient registration processes are one of the biggest culprits that cause non-clinical denials from insurance payers.  This can include many errors such as inputting an incorrect date of birth, not validating current insurance coverage/benefits, misspelling a guarantor's name, etc.  Normally, these errors are usually easy to identify and amend upon submitting a new bill to most payers after correcting a mistake made in the registration department.  It is critically important to monitor denials on a daily basis in order to identify how much of denial ratio is generated from these clerical errors so that both training and education can take place with the appropriate staff within the registration department.

==Medical coding==
An important aspect of the revenue cycle is compliance with [[Medical classification|medical coding]] regulations. Optimal coding compliance results in higher revenues and decreases claim denials from insurance companies. By achieving optimal coding, a medical practice can prevent disruption of the medical flow and avoid regulatory penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genpact.com/docs/resource-/regulatory-impact-on-revenue-cycle-management|title=Regulatory Impact on Revenue Cycle Management— Think You’re Prepared? Think Again|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Billing/collections==
Otherwise known as the Business Office or Patient Financial Services department, the billing/collections team are responsible for submitting a complete UB-04 claim (facility and ancillary billing) or a CMS1500 form (physician billing) to the insurance payers after a patient has received services for either an inpatient or outpatient type of visit.  Usually, a third party claim scrubbing system is then used to ensure that claims are as clean and complete as possible, including edits that may automatically update the raw claim data received from the host system. The intention of this scrubbing is to inevitably avoid generating a potential denial from the payer, which can prolong reimbursement to a provider. The claim is then sent out from the provider to the payer in an ANSI 837 5010 standard format.

Denials can be sent back as a response to the claim from the payer stating a specific reason of why the claim cannot be adjudicated.  This is where denial management processes help to ensure that there is an immediate resolution to these denials.  Denial management can also help to identify if there are trending issues within a provider's workflow processes, whether it be clinical or clerical-related.  Feedback should be provided to the responsible revenue cycle departments if any of them were the cause of the denial, especially with denial types such as medical necessity, registration/clerical entry errors, etc.

'''Santiago Ramón y Cajal''' ({{IPA-es|sanˈtjaɣo raˈmon i kaˈxal|lang}}; 1 May 1852 – 17 October 1934) was a Spanish [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and [[pathology|pathologist]], specializing in [[neuroanatomy]], particularly the [[histology]] of the [[central nervous system]]. He and [[Camillo Golgi]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1906,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1906/cajal-bio.html&lt;/ref&gt; with Ramón y Cajal thereby becoming the first person of Spanish origin who won a scientific Nobel Prize. His original investigations of the microscopic structure of the brain made him a pioneer of modern [[neuroscience]]. Hundreds of his drawings illustrating the delicate arborizations of brain cells are still in use for educational and training purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Neuroscience |publisher=Society for Neuroscience |url=http://www.sfn.org/index.cfm?pagename=HistoryofNeuroscience_main |accessdate=2008-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515121003/http://www.sfn.org/index.cfm?pagename=HistoryofNeuroscience_main |archivedate=2008-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Santiago Ramón y Cajal was born 1 May 1852 in the town of [[Petilla de Aragón]], [[Navarre]], Spain. His father was an anatomy teacher.

As a child he was transferred many times from one school to another because of behavior that was declared poor, rebellious, and showing an anti-[[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] attitude. An extreme example of his precociousness and rebelliousness at the age of eleven is his 1863 imprisonment for destroying his neighbor's yard gate with a homemade cannon.&lt;ref&gt;Santiago Ramón y Cajal, [http://cvc.cervantes.es/ciencia/cajal/cajal_recuerdos/recuerdos/infancia_10.htm Recuerdos de mi Vida Volume I, Chapter X], Madrid Imprenta y Librería de N. Moya, Madrid 1917, online at Instituto Cervantes (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an avid painter, artist, and gymnast, but his father neither appreciated nor encouraged these abilities, even though these artistic talents would contribute to his success later in life. His father apprenticed him to a shoemaker and barber, to "try and give his son much-needed discipline and stability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Mind for Numbers|publisher=Tarcher Penguin| isbn=978-0-399-16524-5|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was well known for his pugnacious attitude as he worked.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[File:Ramón y Cajal por Izquierdo Vives 1874 Museo del ejercito Toledo.jpg|thumb|Ramón y Cajal as a young captain in the [[Ten Years' War]] in [[Cuba]], 1874.]]

Over the summer of 1868, his father hoped to interest his son in a medical career, and took him to graveyards to find human remains for anatomical study. Sketching bones was a turning point for him and subsequently, he did pursue studies in medicine.&lt;ref name=Finger2000/&gt;{{rp|207}}

Ramón y Cajal attended the medical school of the [[University of Zaragoza]], where his father was an anatomy teacher. He graduated in 1873, aged 21. After a competitive examination, he served as a medical [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the [[Spanish Army]]. He took part in an [[Ten Years' War|expedition to Cuba]] in 1874&amp;ndash;75, where he contracted [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name=Nobel_lectures&gt;{{cite book|title=Nobel lectures, Physiology or Medicine 1901-1921|year=1967|publisher=Elsevier Publishing Company|location=Amsterdam|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1906/cajal.html|accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to heal, he visited the [[Panticosa]] spa-town in the [[Pyrenees]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

After returning to Spain, he received his doctorate in medicine in [[Madrid]] in 1877. In 1879, he became the director of the [[Zaragoza]] Museum, and he married Silveria Fañanás García, with whom he had seven daughters and five sons. Ramón y Cajal worked at the University of Zaragoza until 1883, when he was awarded the position of anatomy professor of the [[University of Valencia]].&lt;ref name=Nobel_lectures/&gt;  His early work at these two universities focused on the pathology of [[inflammation]], the microbiology of [[cholera]], and the structure of [[Epithelium|epithelial]] cells and tissues.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 1887 Ramón y Cajal moved to [[Barcelona]] for a professorship.&lt;ref name=Nobel_lectures/&gt; 
There he first learned about [[Golgi's method]], a cell staining method which uses potassium dichromate and silver nitrate to (randomly) stain a few neurons a dark black color, while leaving the surrounding cells transparent. This method, which he improved, was central to his work, allowing him to turn his attention to the [[central nervous system]] (brain and spinal cord), in which neurons are so densely intertwined that standard microscopic inspection would be nearly impossible. During this period he made extensive detailed drawings of neural material, covering many species and most major regions of the brain.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 1892, he became professor at [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name=Nobel_lectures/&gt; 
in 1899 he became director of the ''Instituto Nacional de Higiene &amp;ndash; ''translated as ''National Institute of Hygiene '', and in 1922 founder of the {{lang|es|Laboratorio de Investigaciones Biológicas}} &amp;ndash; translated as the ''Laboratory of Biological Investigations '', later renamed to the {{lang|es|Instituto Cajal}}, or [[Cajal Institute]].&lt;ref name=Nobel_lectures/&gt;

He died in Madrid on October 17, 1934, at the age of 82,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sherrington | first1 = C.

===Political and religious views===
In 1877, the 25-year-old Ramón y Cajal joined a [[Masonic lodge]].&lt;ref name=pin/&gt;{{rp|156}} John Brande Trend wrote in 1965 that Ramón y Cajal "was a liberal in politics, an evolutionist in philosophy, an agnostic in religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins of Modern Spain|year=1965|publisher=Russell &amp; Russell|author=John Brande Trend|page=82|quote=Ramón y Cajal was a liberal in politics, an evolutionist in philosophy, an agnostic in religion...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Nonetheless, Ramón y Cajal used the term soul "without any shame".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Educating the Whole Child for the Whole World: The Ross School Model and Education for the Global Era|year=2010|publisher=NYU Press| isbn=9780814741405| author=Carolyn Sattin-Bajaj|editor=Marcelo Suarez-Orozco|page=165|quote=In that sense, it was interesting to learn that Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the great pioneer of modern neuroanatomy, was agnostic, but still used the term soul without any shame.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was said to later have regretted having left organized religion,&lt;ref name=pin&gt;José María López Piñero, "Santiago Ramón y Cajal", Universita de València&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 343}} Ultimately, he became convinced of a belief in God as a creator, as stated during his first lecture before the [[Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rac.es/ficheros/doc/00207.pdf DISCURSO DEL SR. D. SANTIAGO RAMÓN Y CAJALTEMA: FUNDAMENTOS RACIONALES Y CONDICIONES TÉCNICAS DE LAINVESTIGACIÓN BIOLÓGICA] Sesquicentenario de Santiago Ramon y Cajal], 23 pages, p. 39-40: ''a los que te dicen que la Ciencia apaga toda poesía, secando las fuentes del sentimiento y el ansia de misterio que late en el fondo del alma humana, contéstales que á la vana poesía del vulgo, basada en una noción errónea del Universo, noción tan mezquina como pueril, tú sustituyes otra mucho más grandiosa y sublime, que es la poesía de la verdad, la incomparable belleza de la obra de Dios y de las leyes eternas por Él establecidas. Él acierta exclusivamente a comprender algo de ese lenguaje misterioso que Dios ha escrito en los fenómenos de la Naturaleza; y a él solamente le ha sido dado desentrañar la maravillosa obra de la Creación para rendir a la Divinidad uno de los cultos más gratos y aceptos a un Supremo entendimiento, el de estudiar sus portentosas obras, para en ellas y por ellas conocerle, admirarle y reverenciarle.'' [English Translation: P. 39-40: To those who tell you that Science quenches all poetry, drying up the sources of feeling and the longing for mystery that pulses in the depths of the human soul, tell them that in the vain poetry of the people, based on an erroneous notion of Universe, as petty as it is puerile, you substitute a much more grandiose and sublime one, which is the poetry of truth, the incomparable beauty of the work of God and the eternal laws established by him. He is only able to understand something of that mysterious language that God has written in the phenomena of Nature; And he has only been able to unravel the wonderful work of Creation to render to the Divinity one of the most grateful and accepted cults to a supreme understanding, to study his portentous works, for them and for them to know, to admire and to revere him ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serrablo.org/revista/151/las-creencias-de-darwin-y-cajal |title=Las creencias de Darwin y Cajal &amp;#124; Amigos de Serrablo |publisher=Serrablo.org |date=2009-03-31 |accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discoveries and theories==
[[File:Cajal-mi.jpg|thumb|right|Ramón y Cajal in his laboratory.]]

Ramón y Cajal made several major contributions to neuroanatomy.&lt;ref name=Finger2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Finger|first=Stanley|title=Minds behind the brain: A history of the pioneers and their discoveries.|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-508571-X|pages=197–216|chapter=Chapter 13: Santiago Ramón y Cajal. From nerve nets to neuron doctrine}}&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered the axonal [[growth cone]], and demonstrated experimentally that the relationship between nerve cells was not ''continuous'', but ''contiguous''.&lt;ref name=Finger2000 /&gt; This provided definitive evidence for what [[Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz|Heinrich Waldeyer]] coined the  term [[neuron theory]] as opposed to the [[reticular theory]] This is now widely considered the foundation of modern neuroscience.&lt;ref name=Finger2000 /&gt;

He was an advocate of the existence of [[dendritic spines]], although he did not recognize them as the site of contact from presynaptic cells. He was a proponent of polarization of nerve cell function and his student, [[Rafael Lorente de Nó]], would continue this study of input-output systems into [[cable theory]] and some of the earliest circuit analysis of neural structures.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

By producing excellent depictions of neural structures and their connectivity and providing detailed descriptions of cell types he discovered a new type of cell, which was subsequently named after him, the [[interstitial cell of Cajal]] (ICC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anaesthetist.com/anaes/patient/ans/Findex.htm#ens.htm |title=FANZCA part I notes on the Autonomic Nervous System |publisher=Anaesthetist.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cell is found interleaved among neurons embedded within the [[smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscles]] lining the [[Gastrointestinal tract|gut]], serving as the generator and pacemaker of the [[catastalsis|slow waves of contraction]] which move [[chyme|material]] along the [[gastrointestinal tract]], mediating neurotransmission from motor neurons to smooth muscle cells.

In his 1894 [[Croonian Lecture]], Ramón y Cajal suggested (in an extended metaphor) that cortical [[pyramidal cells]] may become more elaborate with time, as a tree grows and extends its branches.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

He devoted a considerable amount of time studying French  which he used to help his wife during labor and parapsychological phenomena.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} A book he had written on these topics was lost during the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Ramón y Cajal's efforts to improve the state of scientific research and education in Spain were part of a broader preoccupation with [[Regenerationism]] among Spanish intellectuals.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Distinctions==
[[File:Ramón y Cajal Burgos.JPG|thumb|right|Bust of Santiago Ramón y Cajal in [[Burgos]].]]

Ramón y Cajal received many prizes, distinctions, and societal memberships during his scientific career, including [[honorary degree|honorary doctorates in medicine]] from [[Cambridge University]] and [[Würzburg University]] and an honorary [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate in philosophy]] from [[Clark University]].&lt;ref name=Nobel_lectures/&gt; The most famous distinction he was awarded was the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1906, together with the Italian scientist [[Camillo Golgi]] "in recognition of their work on the structure of the nervous system".&lt;ref name=Nobel_lectures/&gt; This caused some controversy because Golgi, a staunch supporter of [[reticular theory]], disagreed with Ramón y Cajal in his view of the neuron doctrine.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Even before Ramón y Cajal's work, Norwegian scientist [[Fridtjof Nansen]] established the contiguous nature of nerve cells in his study of certain marine life, which Ramón y Cajal failed to cite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''Saudi Society of Dermatology and Dermatologic Surgery''' (in [[Arabic]] '''الجمعية السعودية لأمراض وجراحة الجلد'''), commonly abbreviated as SSDDS, (formerly '''The Saudi Society of Dermatology and Venereology'''), is a scientific organization that was established in 1989; to unite [[dermatologist]] and [[venereologist]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] to contribute their experiences and research for the development of healthcare [[solution]]s to skin diseases facing the citizenry in the country and other dermatologic related issues.

Dr. Sami Al Sogair has been attributed to the foundation of the [[society]], who also stands as its president since 1989 until 1994.

In 1994, an SSDDS election installed Dr. Omar Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh as president and holds this post up to present.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The '''smear layer''' is a layer of [[microcrystalline]] and organic particle debris that is found spread on [[root canal]] walls after root canal instrumentation. It was first described in 1975 and much research has been performed since then to evaluate its importance in assisting or preventing the penetration of bacteria into the dentinal tubules. More broadly, it is the organic layer found over all hard tooth surfaces.

==First description==
Early studies of dentinal walls after cavity preparation performed by Brännström and Johnson (1974) showed the presence of a thin layer of [[debris]] that was 2 to 5 [[micrometre]]s thick.&lt;ref&gt;Brännström M, Johnson G. Effects of various conditioners and cleaning agents on prepared dentin surfaces: A scanning electron microscopic investigation. J Prosthet Dent 1974; 31:422-430.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 McComb and Smith first described the smear layer. They observed an amorphous layer of debris, with an irregular and granular surface, on instrumented dentinal walls using a [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM). This smear layer was composed of [[dentin]], [[Pulp (tooth)|pulp]] and [[bacteria]]l remnants. The authors stated that “most standard instrumentation techniques produced a canal wall that was smeared and packed with debris.”&lt;ref&gt;McComb D, Smith DC. A preliminary scanning electron microscopic study of root canals after endodontic procedures. J Endod 1975; 7:238-242.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 Pashely described the smear layer as being composed of two phases; an organic phase, composed of [[collagen]] residues and [[glycosaminoglycan]]s from [[extracellular matrix]] of pulp cells, which acts as a matrix for an inorganic phase. This organomineral content is composed of two distinct superposed layers. The first layer covers the canal wall and is loosely adherent and easy to remove. The second layer however occludes the dentinal [[tubule]]s and strongly adheres to the canal walls.&lt;ref&gt;Pashely DH. Smear layer:Physiological considerations. Operative Dent Suppl 1984; 3:13-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year Mader et al. studied the [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics of the smear layer in teeth that were endodontically instrumented with k type files and irrigated with 5.25% NaOCl. The smear layer was examined from two aspects; the first “downonto” the smear layer and the second from the side or profile view. [[Photomicrograph]]s obtained by SEM showed that the smear layer consists of two confluent components. A thin superficial layer 1-2 micrometres thick overlying a densely packed layer that penetrated into the dentinal tubules for distances of up to 40 micrometres. The packed material showed finger like structures projecting into the tubules from the canal wall. There is still [[controversy]] over whether the smear layer should be removed and whether the disadvantages of leaving it in place overcome its benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Mader CL, Baumgärtner JC, Peters DD. Scanning electron microscopic investigation of the smeared layer on root canal walls. J Endod 1984; 10:477-483.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bacterial penetration==
Olgart et al. (1974)  examined the penetration of bacteria into dentinal tubules of ground, fractured and acid treated dentin surfaces. [[In vitro]] the penetration of bacteria into tubules of intact dentin exposed by fracture was compared in pairs of teeth, one of which in each pair was mounted with intrapulpal [[hydrostatic pressure]] (30mmHg). [[In vivo]], intra pair comparisons of bacterial invasion into dentinal tubules beneath ground, fractured and acid treated surfaces were made. They observed that an outward flow of [[fluid]]s into the tubules due to intrapulpal pressure mechanically hindered [[bacterial growth]] and that the debris and smear layer produced from grinding obstructed the bacterial invasion into tubules. However this barrier seemed to be removed after a few days which allowed bacterial growth into intact dentin. Olgart came to a conclusion that [[acid]] produced by [[microorganism]]s may dissolve the smear layer allowing bacteria to pass into dentinal tubules.&lt;ref&gt;Olgart L, Brännström M, Johnson G.  Invasion of bacteria into dentinal tubules: Experiments in vivo and Invitro. Acta Odontologica Scandinavica 1974; 32:61-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when Pashley et al. (1981)  studied the scanning electron microscope (SEM) appearance of dentin before and after removing successive layers of the smear layer they came to a different conclusion. Twenty dentin disks were cut from human extracted [[third molar]]s. The dentin surface of the disks was etched with 6% [[citric acid]] for 5, 15, 30, 45 and 60 seconds. SEM examination showed that citric acid was able to remove smear layer in successive layers according to etching time finally exposing the dentinal tubules. Pashley concluded that the maintenance of the smear layer established a protective [[diffusion barrier]].&lt;ref&gt;Pashley DH, Michelich V, Kehl T.  Dentin permeability: effects of smear layer removal. J Prosthet Dent 1981; 46:531-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gettleman et al. (1991) assessed the influence of a smear layer on the [[adhesion]] of sealer cements to dentin. A total of 120 teeth was tested, 40 per sealer namely AH26, Sultan, and Sealapex; 20 each with and without the smear layer. The teeth were split longitudinally, and the internal surfaces were ground flat. In the smear layer-free specimens the smear layer was removed by washing for 3 minutes with 17% [[EDTA]] followed by 5.25% NaOCl. Using a specially designed jig, the [[sealant|sealer]] was placed into a 4-mm wide × 4-mm deep well which was then set onto the tooth at a 90-degree angle and allowed to set for 7 days. This set-up was then placed into a mounting jig which was designed for the [[Instron]] Universal Testing Machine so that only a tensile load was applied without shearing. The set-up was subjected to a tensile load at a crosshead speed of 1&amp;nbsp;mm per min. The only significant difference with regard to the presence or absence of the smear layer was found with AH26, which had a stronger bond when the smear layer was removed.&lt;ref&gt;Gettleman BH, Messer HH, ElDeeb ME. Adhesion of sealer cements to dentin with and without the smear layer. J Endod 1991; 17:15-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further research==
Clark-Holke et al. (2003) focused on determining the effect of the smear layer on the magnitude of bacterial penetration through the [[apical foramen]] around obturating materials. Thirty extracted teeth were classified into two test groups; the first group had the smear layer removed by rinsing with 17% EDTA while in the second group the smear layer was left intact. Canal preparation and [[obturation]] using lateral condensation, [[gutta-percha]], and AH 26 sealer was performed on all of the teeth. The model systems consisted of an upper chamber attached to the cemento-[[Tooth enamel|enamel]] junction and a lower chamber at the apices of the teeth. Standardized bacterial suspensions containing ''[[Fusobacterium nucleatum]]'', ''[[Campylobacter rectus]]'' and ''[[Peptostreptococcus|Peptostreptococcus micros]]'' were inoculated into the upper chambers. Models were incubated anaerobically at 37 degrees C. Leakage results were as follows: In the first group 6 teeth showed bacterial leakage, the second group and third groups showed no bacterial leakage. This study indicated that removal of the smear layer reduced the leakage of bacteria through the root canal system.&lt;ref&gt;Clark-Holke D, Drake D, Walton R, Rivera E, Guthmiller JM. Bacterial penetration through canals of endodontically treated teeth in the presence or absence of the smear layer. J Dent 2003; 31:275-281.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kokkas et al. (2004) examined the effect of the smear layer on the penetration depth of three different sealers (AH Plus, Apexit, and a Grossman type-Roth 811) into the dentinal tubules. Sixty four extracted human single-rooted teeth were used and divided into two groups. The smear layer remained intact in all the roots of group A. Complete removal of the smear layer in group B was achieved after [[irrigation]] with 3 ml of 17% EDTA for 3 min, followed by 3 ml of 1% NaOCl solution. Ten roots from each group were obturated with AH Plus and laterally condensed gutta-percha points. The same process was repeated for the remaining roots by using sealers Apexit and Roth 811 correspondingly. After complete setting, the maximum penetration depth of the sealers into the dentinal tubules was examined in upper, middle, and lower levels. The smear layer prevented all the sealers from penetrating dentinal tubules. In contrast, in smear layer–free root canals, all the sealers penetrated dentinal tubules, although the depth of penetration varied between the sealers.&lt;ref&gt;Kokkas AB, Boutsioukis ACh, Vassiliadis LP, Stavrianos CK. The influence of the smear layer on dentinal tubule penetration depth by three different root canal sealers. J Endod 2004; 30:100-102.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, smear layer adversely affected the coronal and apical sealing ability of sealers.

Çobankara et al. (2004) determined the effect of the smear layer on apical and coronal leakage in root canals obturated with AH26 or RoekoSeal sealers. A total of 160 maxillary anterior teeth were used. Eight groups were created by all possible combinations of three factors: smear layer (present/absent), leakage assessment (apical/coronal), and sealer used (AH26/Roeko-Seal). All teeth were obturated using lateral condensation technique of gutta-percha. A fluid filtration method was used to test apical or coronal leakage. According to the results of this study, the smear (+) groups displayed higher apical and coronal leakage than those smear (-) groups for both root canal sealers. Apical leakage was significantly higher than coronal leakage for both root canal sealers used in this study. It was determined that that removal of the smear layer has a positive effect in reducing apical and coronal leakage for both AH26 and RoekoSeal root canal sealers.&lt;ref&gt;Çobankara FK, Adanir N, Sema Belli.  Evaluation of the influence of smear layer on the apical and coronal sealing ability of two sealers. J Endod 2004; 30:406-409.&lt;/ref&gt;

However Bertacci et al. (2007) evaluated the ability of a warm [[gutta-percha#Dentistry|gutta-percha]] obturation system Thermafil to fill lateral channels in the presence or absence of the smear layer. Forty single-rooted extracted human teeth were randomly divided into two groups one of which had the smear layer removed by 5 ml of 5% NaOCl followed by 2.5 ml of 17% EDTA. Obturation was performed using AH Plus sealer and Thermafil. Specimens were cleared in methyl salicylate and analyzed under a stereomicroscope to evaluate the number, length, and diameter of lateral channels. All lateral channels were found to be filled in both groups. No statistically significant differences regarding number, length, and diameter were observed between the two groups. It was concluded that the smear layer did not prevent the sealing of lateral channels.&lt;ref&gt;Bertacci A, Baroni C, Breschi L, Venturi M, Prati C. The influence of smear layer in lateral channels filling. Clin Oral Investig 2007; 11:353-359.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yildirim et al. (2008) investigated the effect of the smear layer on apical microleakage in teeth obturated with MTA. Fifty single-rooted central maxillary teeth were used in this study. The selected teeth were instrumented and randomly divided into 2 groups. In the first group (smear [+]), the teeth were irrigated with only 5.25% NaOCl. In the second group (smear [-]), the teeth were irrigated with EDTA (17%) and NaOCl (5.25%) to remove the smear layer. The teeth were then filled with MTA. The computerized fluid filtration method was used for evaluation of apical microleakage. The quantitative apical leakage of each tooth was measured after 2, 30, and 180 days. It was found that there was no difference between the groups after 2 days but removal of the smear layer caused significantly more apical microleakage than when the smear layer was left intact after 30 and 180 days. It was concluded that the apical microleakage of MTA is less when the smear layer is present than when it is absent.&lt;ref&gt;Yildirim T, Oruçoğlu H, Cobankara FK. Long-term evaluation of the influence of smear layer on the apical sealing ability of MTA. J Endod 2008; 34:1537-1540.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saleh et al. (2008) studied the effect of the smear layer on the penetration of bacteria along different root canal filling materials. A total of 110 human root segments were instrumented to size 80 under irrigation with 1% sodium hypochlorite. Half of the roots were irrigated with a 5-mL rinse of 17% EDTA to remove the smear layer. Roots were filled with gutta-percha (GP) and AH Plus sealer (AH), GP and Apexit sealer (AP), or RealSeal cones and sealer (RS). Following storage in humid conditions at 37 degrees C for 7 days, the specimens were mounted into a bacterial leakage test model for 135 days. Survival analyses were performed to calculate the median time of leakage and log-rank test was used for pairwise comparisons of groups. Selected specimens were longitudinally sectioned and inspected by scanning electron microscopy for the presence of bacteria at the interfaces. In the presence of the smear layer, RS and AP leaked significantly more slowly than in its absence. In the absence of the smear layer, AH leaked significantly more slowly than RS. It was concluded that removal of the smear layer did not impair bacterial penetration along root canal fillings. A comparison of the sealers revealed no difference except that AH performed better than RS in the absence of the smear layer.&lt;ref&gt;Saleh IM, Ruyter IE, Haapasalo M, Ørstavik D. Bacterial penetration along different root canal filling materials in the presence or absence of smear layer. Int Endod J. 2008; 41:32-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fachin et al.(2009) evaluated whether smear layer removal has any influence on the filling of the root canal system, by examining the obturation of lateral canals, secondary canals and apical deltas. Eighty canines were randomly divided into two groups, according to their irrigation regimen. Both groups were irrigated with 1% NaOCl during canal shaping, but only the teeth in Group II received a final irrigation with 17% EDTA for smear layer removal. The root canals were obturated with lateral condensation of gutta-percha and the specimens were cleared, allowing for observation under the microscope. The results showed that In Groups I and II, 42.5% and 37.5% of the teeth, respectively, presented at least one filled canal ramification. In conclusion, smear layer removal under the conditions tested in this study did not affect the obturation of root canal ramifications when lateral condensation of gutta-percha was the technique used for root canal filling.&lt;ref&gt;Fachin EV, Scarparo RK, Massoni LI. Influence of smear layer removal on the obturation of root canal ramifications. J Appl Oral Sci 2009; 17:240-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UCLA Health''' is an [[academic medical center]] which comprises a number of hospitals and an extensive primary care network in the [[Los Angeles]] region. Together, the network aims to achieve coverage for two million lives: "every 4 miles 4 PCPs plus a 50,000 sq. ft. hub within 15 miles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uclahealth.org/business-strategy/Pages/about-our-business-strategy.aspx|title=UCLA Health - Business Strategy - About Business Strategy|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a regional health provider, it benefits from the academic affiliation offered by the [[UCLA]] campus, as this increases its status in the medical marketplace.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} For instance, the symbiotic relationship with the campus allowed the creation of nominal assistant professor-level appointments for primary care physicians, but this practice has now{{When|date=September 2016}} been limited because of opposition from the academic community.&lt;ref name="aamc.org"&gt;https://www.aamc.org/download/360982/data/uclaprofile.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, UCLA Health founded Operation Mend, a program for treating military veterans who were wounded in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2016 Operation Mend received a grant from [[Wounded Warrior Project]] to expand its offering to include [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] treatment and became part of the [[Warrior Care Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailynews.com/veterans/20160413/uclas-operation-mend-to-help-veterans-with-hidden-wounds-of-war|title=UCLA’s Operation Mend to help veterans with hidden wounds of war|last=Abram|first=Susan|date=April 13, 2016|work=Los Angeles Daily News|access-date=2017-03-29|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 report by the California State Auditor&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bsa.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2013-111.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that the financial transactions from the health system to the medical school, which have grown threefold over the reporting period, deserve more transparency. A study by the [[Rand Corporation]] about leadership structures at UCLA Health again addresses the ambiguous position of UCLA Health as both an academic and a commercial entity.&lt;ref&gt;http://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/july15/h1attach.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; More recently,{{When|date=September 2016}} the [[University of California|UCOP]] has scheduled a bylaw amendment for the Committee on Health Services with a view to change the composition of the leadership structure to enable the UCLA Health System (then so called) to compete and collaborate more effectively in the health services marketplace. 

The governance structure includes a non-fiduciary Board of Overseers&lt;ref name="aamc.org"/&gt; and a Community Engagement Committee that is made up of faculty and staff and reports to the Vice Chancellor, Health Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strategy.healthsciences.ucla.edu/pages/dt-community|title=UCLA School of Medicine Strategic Planning Initiative: Pages|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition there is a UCLA Health Sustainability Steering Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainability.uclahealth.org/body.cfm?id=49|title=Structure: UCLA Health Sustainability - Los Angeles, CA|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Step 2 CK includes test items in the following content areas: internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, preventive medicine, psychiatry, surgery, other areas relevant to provision of care under supervision.

Most Step 2 CK test items describe clinical situations and require that you provide one or more of the following: diagnosis, a prognosis, an indication of underlying mechanisms of disease, the next step in medical care, including preventive measures.

Step 2 CK is a broadly based, integrated examination. It frequently requires interpretation of tables and laboratory data, imaging studies, photographs of gross and microscopic pathologic specimens, and results of other diagnostic studies. Step 2 CK classifies test items along two dimensions: disease category and physician task.

== Scoring ==
Scoring is reported in 3 digit scores. Scores fall between 1 and 300, with the mean score of 240 and the standard deviation of 18 for first-time takers from accredited medical schools in the United States and Canada for the 2013/14 and 2014/15 academic years.   Every three to four years the Step Committees are asked to complete an in-depth review of standards, and they may schedule more frequent reviews.  At its May 2014 meeting, the Step 2 Committee conducted a review for USMLE Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK). As a result of its review, the Step 2 Committee decided to raise the Step 2 recommended minimum passing score to 209 for students taking the test after July 1, 2014. A more recent review in May 2018 maintained the passing score of 209. 

==Effect on Residency Matching==
The USMLE Step 2 CK score is one of many factors considered by [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] programs in [[National Resident Matching Program|selecting]] applicants. Along with the USMLE Step 1, this test is a standardized measure of all applicants. The median USMLE Step 2 scores for graduates of U.S. Medical Schools for various residencies can be found in "Charting Outcomes in the Match" available at http://www.nrmp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Charting-Outcomes-2014-Final.pdf

A '''ureterovaginal fistula''' is an abnormal passageway existing between the [[ureter]] and the [[vagina]]. It presents as urinary [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]]. Its impact on  women is to reduce the "quality of life dramatically."{{sfn|Abele|page=0675}}

== Cause ==
A urerovaginal fistula is a result of [[Traumatology|trauma]], [[infection]], pelvic [[surgery]], [[radiation treatment]] and [[radiation therapy|therapy]], [[malignancy]], or [[inflammatory bowel disease]].  [[Symptom]]s can be troubling for women especially since some  clinicians delay treatment until [[inflammation]] is reduced and stronger tissue has formed.&lt;ref name="Al OtaibiBarakat2012" /&gt;  The fistula may develop as a maternal birth injury from a long and protracted [[birth|labor]], long [[cervical dilation|dilation]] time and expulsion period. Difficult deliveries can create pressure [[necrosis]] in the tissue that is being pushed between the head of the infant and the softer tissues of the [[vagina]], [[ureter]]s, and [[bladder]].{{sfn|Abele|page=0675}}

Radiographic imaging can assist clinicians in identifying the abnormality.&lt;ref name="MoonKim2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moon|first1=Sung Gyu|last2=Kim|first2=Seung Hyup|last3=Lee|first3=Hak Jong|last4=Moon|first4=Min Hoan|last5=Myung|first5=Jae Sung|title=Pelvic Fistulas Complicating Pelvic Surgery or Diseases: Spectrum of Imaging Findings|journal=Korean Journal of Radiology|volume=2|issue=2|year=2001|pages=97|issn=1229-6929|doi=10.3348/kjr.2001.2.2.97}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Ureterovaginal fistula is always indicative of an obstructed kidney necessitating emergency intervention followed later by an [[elective surgery|elective surgical]] repair of the fistula.&lt;ref name="Al OtaibiBarakat2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Al Otaibi|first1=Khalid|last2=Barakat|first2=Alaa-Eldin|last3=El Darawany|first3=Hamed|last4=Sheikh|first4=Abulhasan|last5=Fadaak|first5=Kamel|last6=Al Sowayan|first6=Ossamah|last7=Alsuhaibani|first7=Shaheed|last8=Al Damanhouri|first8=Reem|last9=Madi|first9=Maha|last10=Elsadr|first10=Ahmed|title=Minimally invasive treatment of ureterovaginal fistula: A review and report of a new technique|journal=Arab Journal of Urology|volume=10|issue=4|year=2012|pages=414–417|issn=2090-598X|doi=10.1016/j.aju.2012.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

== Treatment ==
Many women delay treatment for decades.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; Surgeons often will correct the fistula through major gynecological [[surgery]]. Newer treatments can include the placement of a [[stent]] and is usually successful. In 0.5-2.5% of major pelvic surgeries a ureterovaginal fistula will form, usually weeks later.&lt;ref name="Al OtaibiBarakat2012" /&gt; If the fistula cannot be repaired, the clinician may create a permanent diversion of urine or [[urostomy]].{{sfn|Abele|page=0782}} Risks associated with the repair of the fistula are also associated with most other surgical procedures and include the risk of [[adhesions]], disorders of wound healing, [[infection]], ileus, and [[Lying (position)|immobilization]]. There is a recurrence rate of 5%–15% in the surgical operation done to correct the fistula.{{sfn|Abele|page=0675}}

== Culture and epidemiology ==
Birth injuries that result in the formation of fistulas and urinary and fecal incontinence have been found to be strongly associated with economic and cultural factors.&lt;ref name=un /&gt; Teenagers and women who sustain injuries that develop into ureterovaginal fistulas during childbirth suffer significant social stigma.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web| title= After a Devastating Birth Injury, Hope |last=Grady  |first=Denise  |publisher=New York Times|date=23 February 2009|access-date=7 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ureterovaginal fistulas related to prolonged, obstructed labor are rare in developed nations but are more common in countries where access to emergent obstetrical care is limited.{{sfn|Abele|page=0627}}

'''Werner Uri Spitz''' (born August 22, 1926) is a German-American [[forensic pathologist]] who has worked on a number of high-profile cases, including the investigations of the [[assassinations]] of president [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr]]. He also testified at the trials of [[Casey Anthony]] and [[Phil Spector]], the civil trial against [[O.J.

==Biography==
Werner Spitz was born in 1926 to Siegfried and Anna Spitz in [[Stargard]], [[Germany]] (now [[Poland]]), both [[physician]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spitz|first1=Werner U.|last2=Spitz|first2=Daniel J.|last3=Fisher|first3=Russell S.|title=Spitz and Fisher's Medicolegal Investigation of Death: Guidelines for the Application of Pathology to Crime Investigation|date=2006|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|location=5|isbn=9780398075446|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-m_fb580Vx0C&amp;pg=PR5|accessdate=June 20, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the growing [[antisemitism]] in Germany, his family fled to [[Mandatory Palestine]] when he was a child. Spitz's father  got Werner a job working in a [[medical examiner]]'s office where he was charged with cleaning and other small duties. Spitz eventually began assisting with the [[autopsies]] and he recalls assisting with the autopsy of future Israeli [[Prime Minister]] [[Golda Meir]]'s husband Morris Meyerson in 1951. He began medical school at the [[Geneva University]] in Switzerland. After four years in Geneva, the [[Hebrew University in Jerusalem]] established the university's Medical School and he transferred, receiving his medical doctorate after an additional three years. He graduated at the age of 27.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Amber Hunt|title=His fascination with death runs in the family: Pathologist turns curiosity into a career|url=http://www.med.wayne.edu/news_media/scribe/PDF/scribe2005win.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2014|newspaper=Detroit Free Press via Wayne State University Scribe|date=Winter 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph"&gt;{{cite news|last=Joseph|first=Gina|title=Macomb pathologist Spitz offers observations from JFK assassination|url=http://www.macombdaily.com/events/20131121/macomb-pathologist-spitz-offers-observations-from-jfk-assassination|newspaper=The Macomb Daily|date=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spitz moved to [[United States|America]] in 1959. His decision to leave his native Israel was partly inspired by the lack of need for his chosen career path in the area. "In seven years in Israel, there was only one murder." He said. "It just wasn't the right place for a forensic pathologist."&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;  Spitz later served as Deputy Chief Medical Examiner in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and Chief Medical Examiner for Wayne County, Michigan (Wayne County includes the city of Detroit).

==Work as a forensic pathologist==
In 1969, Spitz testified on behalf of Joseph and Gwen Kopechne, the parents of [[Mary Jo Kopechne]], who died following a car accident in the vehicle of [[Ted Kennedy]]. Kopechne was presumed to have died from drowning after Kennedy's car drove off a bridge on [[Chappaquiddick Island|Chappaquiddick island]] and plunged into the water. Kopechne's parents were seeking to prevent her body from being exhumed and autopsied. Spitz testified that the autopsy was unnecessary and the available evidence was sufficient to conclude that Kopechne died from drowning. The judge sided with Kopechne's parents and denied the request for exhumation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tedrow|first=Richard L., and Thomas L.|title=Death at Chappaquiddick|year=1980|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=1455603406|pages=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Examiner testifies against kopechne autopsy|url=http://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19691022-01.2.4|newspaper=Daily Kent Stater|date=October 22, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, while Spitz was the deputy chief medical examiner for Maryland, he determined that [[murder of Catherine Cesnik|Sister Cathy Cesnik]], a 26-year-old Catholic nun who disappeared in November 1969, had been murdered by a blow to the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nawrozki|first1=Joe|last2=Erlandson|first2=Robert A.|title=Sister Catherine Cesnik case: With new lead, police reopen old murder case|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/retro-baltimore/catherine-cesnik/bal-with-new-lead-police-reopen-old-murder-case-20170530-story.html|accessdate=June 19, 2017|work=[[Baltimore Sun]]|date=June 19, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, a witness came forward and said a priest took her, then a young teen, to see Cesnik's body shortly after she had gone missing, as a warning to not say anything about the sexual abuse that was allegedly occurring at her Catholic school. The witness told police she remembered maggots on Cesnik's corpse, but was not believed, as police said there could not have been maggots in November. However, in 2016, when Spitz's original autopsy was made public, it noted there were maggots present. Werner confirmed this when interviewed for the 2017 [[Netflix]] series ''[[The Keepers]]'', about Cesnik's murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sisk|first1=Annie|title='The Keepers' recap, Episode 6: Revisiting a cold case|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/tv/tv-lust/bs-fe-keepers-recap-episode-6-story.html|accessdate=June 19, 2017|work=[[Baltimore Sun]]|date=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Spitz was asked to work as an advisor to both the [[United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]] and the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]]. He reviewed the autopsy performed 12 years earlier on president John F. Kennedy by military pathologists. "They botched that autopsy," Spitz said. "They had absolutely no experience in forensic pathology." He attributed the flaws in the investigation to the fact that at that time in the United States, forensic pathology was in its infancy. Despite his conclusion that the original investigation was flawed, he agreed with the [[Warren Commission]]'s conclusion that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] acted alone in the shooting.&lt;ref name="Joseph"/&gt;

In 1979, Spitz consulted with the same committees on the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. The committee determined that King was killed by one rifle shot by [[James Earl Ray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/|publisher=U.S. House of representatives|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, he testified for the defense in the trial of Casey Anthony for the [[death of Caylee Anthony|death of her daughter, Caylee]]. He disagreed with the prosecution's medical examiner [[Jan Garavaglia]] that the death could be ruled a homicide based on the autopsy, calling her work "shoddy". Garavaglia admitted that the cause of death could not be ascertained by the autopsy she performed, but ruled it a homicide based on the circumstances. He criticized her for failing to open the skull and test sediment found in the skull that he believed to be proof that she decomposed on her side instead of in the position in which she was found. He disagreed with the state's theory that duct tape found next to Caylee's body was used as a murder weapon, saying it is much more likely that the duct tape was placed after her death to hold the mandible in place when moving the body. He also believes that the placement of Caylee's hair was staged by someone before being photographed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Defense expert: Autopsy on Caylee Anthony 'shoddy'|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-06-17-casey-anthony-trial_n.htm|newspaper=USA Today|date=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Werner Spitz Discusses His Life's Work: Death|url=http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/werner-spitz-discusses-his-lifes-work-death|accessdate=June 20, 2017|publisher=WDIV|date=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spitz is a professor of pathology at [[Wayne State University School of Medicine]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] and an adjunct professor of pathology at the [[University of Windsor]] in Canada.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; He has authored a book entitled: ''Spitz and Fisher's Medicolegal Investigation of Death: Guidelines for the Application of Pathology to Crime Investigation'', an important book in the field often referred to as "the bible of forensic pathology".&lt;ref name="Spitz, Werner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bible"/&gt;
