'''Elections to the Algerian Assembly''' were held in Algeria in February 1954.&lt;ref name=DS&gt;[[Dolf Sternberger]], [[Bernhard Vogel (politician)|Bernhard Vogel]], [[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Klaus Landfried (1978) ''Die Wahl der Parlamente: Band II: Afrika, Erster Halbband'', p432 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other post-1948 elections in French Algeria, it was rigged by the authorities to ensure the defeat of Algerian nationalists.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;Frank Tachau (1994) ''Political parties of the Middle East and North Africa'', Greenwood Press, p10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral system==
The Assembly was elected by two colleges, each of which elected 60 seats; the First College consisted of Europeans and [[évolué]]s, whilst the Second College was composed of the remainder of the Algerian population.

'''Apollonia''' ({{lang-sq|Apolonia}}; {{lang-el|Ἀπολλωνία κατ᾿ Ἐπίδαμνον}} or Ἀπολλωνία πρὸς Ἐπίδαμνον, ''Apollonia kat' Epidamnon'' or ''Apollonia pros Epidamnon'') was an [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=96}}; {{harvnb|Wilson|2006|p=594}}; {{harvnb|Chamoux|2003|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; located on the right bank of the [[Aous]] river (modern-day [[Vjosë]]). Its ruins are situated in the [[Fier]] region, near the village of Pojani (Polina), in modern-day [[Albania]]. Apollonia was founded in [[588 BCE]] by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] colonists from [[Corfu]] and [[Corinth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|pp=96–98}}.&lt;/ref&gt; on a site where native [[Illyrian tribes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1976|p=426}}; {{harvnb|Larson|2001|p=162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; lived, and was perhaps the most important of the several classical towns known as ''[[Apollonia (disambiguation)|Apollonia]]''. Apollonia flourished in the Roman period and was home to a renowned school of philosophy, but began to decline in the 3rd century AD when its harbor started silting up as a result of an earthquake. It was abandoned by the end of [[Late Antiquity]].

The name of the city is mentioned among the modern bishoprics of the [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania]] (''Apollonia and Fier''). Apollonia is also a [[titular see]] of the Latin Church.

== History ==
[[File:Map of ancient Epirus and environs (English).svg|thumb|right|200px|Apollonia in antiquity.]]
The site of Apollonia lay on the territory of the [[Taulantii]], a cluster of Illyrian tribes that remained closely involved with the settlement for centuries and lived alongside the Greek colonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|page=98}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The city was said to have originally been named ''Gylakeia'' after its founder, Gylax,&lt;ref name="Hansen 2004 page=328"&gt;{{harvnb|Hansen|Nielsen|2004|page=328}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the name was later changed to honor the god [[Apollo]]. Although this wasn't the only city named by the god Apollo. There were 24 other cities named [[Apollo]], but Illyria's [[Apollo]] was the most important and played a major role as a trading intermediary between the Hellenists and the Illyrians. It is estimated that the city had about 60,000 inhabitants. 

It is mentioned by [[Strabo]] in his ''[[Geographica]]'' as "an exceedingly well-governed city".&lt;ref&gt;Strabo. ''Geographica'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/7E*.html 7.8.316].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] considered Apollonia an important&lt;ref name="Hansen 2004 page=328"/&gt; example of an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] system, as the descendants of the Greek colonists controlled the city and helped Illyrians to learn how to govern. The city grew rich on the [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slave trade]] and local agriculture, as well as its large harbour, said to have been able to hold a hundred ships at a time. The city also benefited from the local supply of [[asphalt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strabo|title=Geographica|pages=VII.5.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle|title=De mirabilibus auscultationibus|pages=842 b.27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a valuable commodity in ancient times, for example for caulking ships. The remains of a late sixth-century temple, located just outside the city, were reported in 2006; it is only the fifth known stone temple found in present-day Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/01/060106122516.htm|title=Researchers Discover Greek Temple In Albania Dating Back To 6th Century B.C.|last=University of Cincinnati|date=6 January 2006|work=Science Daily|accessdate=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Apollonia, like [[Dyrrachium]] further north, was an important port on the Illyrian coast as the most convenient link between Brundusium and northern Greece, and as one of the western starting points of the [[Via Egnatia]] leading east to [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Byzantium]] in [[Thrace]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Apollonia|display=Apollonia s.v. (1)|volume=2|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had its own mint, stamping coins showing a cow suckling her calf on the obverse and a double stellate pattern on the reverse,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wildwinds.com/coins/greece/illyria/apollonia/i.html Illyria, Apollonia - Ancient Greek Coins - WildWinds.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which have been found as far away as the basin of the [[Danube]].

The city was for a time included among the dominions of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]]. In 229 BC, it came under the control of the [[Roman Republic]], to which it was firmly loyal; it was rewarded in 168 BC with booty seized from [[Gentius]], the defeated king of Illyria. In 148 BC, Apollonia became part of the [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Roman province of Macedonia]], specifically of [[Epirus Nova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowden|2003|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Caesar's Civil War|Roman Civil War]] between [[Pompey]] and [[Julius Caesar]], it supported the latter, but fell to [[Marcus Iunius Brutus]] in 48 BC. The later Roman emperor [[Augustus]] studied in Apollonia in 44 BC under the tutelage of Athenodorus of Tarsus; it was there that he received news of Caesar's murder.

Apollonia flourished under Roman rule and was noted by [[Cicero]] in his ''[[Philippicae]]'' as ''magna urbs et gravis'', a great and important city. Christianity was established in the city at an early stage, and bishops from Apollonia were present during the [[First Council of Ephesus]] (431) and the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451). Its decline, however, began in the 3rd century AD, when an earthquake changed the path of the [[Aoös]], causing the harbour to silt up and the inland area to become a [[malaria]]-ridden swamp. The city became increasingly uninhabitable as the inland swamp expanded, and the nearby settlement of [[Avlona, Albania|Avlona]] (modern-day [[Vlorë]]) became dominant. By the end of antiquity, the city was largely depopulated, hosting only a small Christian community. This community (which probably is part of the site of the old city) built on a nearby hill the church of the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]], ({{lang-sq|Shën Mëri}}), part of the [[Ardenica Monastery]].

== Discovery and excavation results ==
[[File:Kapiteli i Monumentit te Agonoteteve.JPG|thumb|Capital of Monument of Agonothetes]]
The city seems to have sunk with the rise of Vlora.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; It was "rediscovered" by European classicists in the 18th century, though it was not until the [[Austria]]n occupation of 1916–1918 that the site was investigated by archaeologists. Their work was continued by a French team between 1924–1938. Parts of the site were damaged during the [[Second World War]]. After the war, an Albanian team undertook further work from 1948 onwards, although much of the site remains unexcavated to this day. Some of the team's archeological discoveries are on display within the monastery, known as the [[Museum of Apollonia]] (opened in 1958) and other artifacts from Apollonia are in the capital [[Tirana]]. Unfortunately, during the anarchy that followed the collapse of the [[communist]] party in 1990 and reversion to capitalism, the archeological collection was plundered and the museum was temporarily closed. The ruins were also frequently dug up by plunderers for relics to be sold to collectors abroad.
In December 2011, a new museum opened, under the directorship of Marin Haxhimihali.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/venice/about-this-office/single-view/news/apollonia_archaeological_museum_reopens_after_20_years_of_closure/ UNESCO Office in Venice: Apollonia Archaeological Museum reopens after 20 years of closure]&lt;/ref&gt;  It replaced an older museum dating from 1985, and was funded by [[UNESCO]]'s [[MDG Achievement Fund|MDG-F]] Joint Programme ”Culture and Heritage for Social and Economic Development”.

In 2006, archaeologists discovered a Greek temple which dates back to the [[6th century B.C.]] just outside of the Apollonia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/01/060106122516.htm Researchers Discover Greek Temple In Albania Dating Back To 6th Century B.C.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, a French-Albanian team of archaeologists unearthed a bust of a Roman soldier, 50 years after the discoveries of other full body statues in the 1958-1960 period expeditions, led by Albanian scholar Selim Islami and [[Russians|Russian]] Professor Blavatski.&lt;ref name="Murati"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.standard.al/index.php/speciale/10352.html |title=In Apollonia the bust of a Roman athlete is unearthed |last=Murati |first=Violeta |date=15 August 2010 |work=Standard |language=Albanian |accessdate=19 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817184730/http://www.standard.al/index.php/speciale/10352.html |archivedate=17 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Episcopal history ==
[[File:Santa Maria Apollonia.jpg|Church of Saint Mary in Apollonia|thumb|290px]]
A bishopric was founded there circa 400 AD but usspressed around 599.
One of the participants in the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431 was a Felix who signed once as Bishop of Apollonia and [[Byllis]], at another time as Bishop of Apollonia. Some assume that the two towns formed a single episcopal see, others suppose he was, strictly speaking, Bishop only of Apollonia, but was temporarily in charge also of Byllis during a vacancy of that see ([[apostolic administrator]]). One of the participants at a council held in Constantinople in 448 signed as ''Paulus Episcopus Apolloniada al. Apolloniatarum, civitatis sanctae ecclesiae'', but it is uncertain whether he was associated with this Apollonia. At the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, Eusebius subscribed simply as Bishop of Apollonia. In the letter of the bishops of [[Epirus Nova]] to the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo I (emperor)|Leo I]] in 458, Philocharis subscribes as Bishop of what the manuscripts call "Vallidus", and which editors think should be corrected to "Byllis". Whether Philocharis is to be considered Bishop also of Apollonia depends on the interpretation of the position of Felix in 431.&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Farlati-Jacopo Coleti, ''Illyricum Sacrum'', vol. VII, Venezia 1817, [https://books.google.com/books?id=z1zLr_T1esUC&amp;pg=PA395 pp. 395-396]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Parigi 1740, Vol. II, coll. 248-249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03092e.htm Louis Petit, "Byllis" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1908)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' lists Apollonia as a [[titular see]], thus recognizing that it was once a residential [[diocese]], a [[suffragan]] of the archbishopric of [[Dyrrachium]],&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 835&lt;/ref&gt; It grants no such recognition to Byllis.&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), "Sedi titolari", pp. 819-1013&lt;/ref&gt; Metropolitan of the [[Roman province]] of [[Epirus Novus]].

[[File:Snow shower on Dartmoor.jpg|thumb|right|An approaching April shower of snow on [[Dartmoor]], [[Devon]], England. (31 March 2010)]]
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, an '''April shower''' is [[rain]] during the month of April. One of the major causes of the often heavy downpours is the position of the [[jet stream]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/april_showers.shtml |year=2008 |publisher=BBC Weather centre |accessdate=2008-06-25 |title=April Showers|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125044045/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/april_showers.shtml|archivedate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early spring, the jet stream starts to move northwards, allowing large depressions to bring strong winds and rain in from the Atlantic. In one day the weather can change from springtime sunshine to winter sleet and snow. The track of these depressions can often be across Ireland and Scotland bringing bands of rain followed by heavy showers (often of hail or snow) and strong blustery winds.

The [[proverb]] "March winds and April showers bring forth May flowers", first recorded in 1886,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the shorter, [[trochaic]] version "April showers bring May flowers" (originally "Sweet April showers/Do spring May flowers", part of a poem recorded in 1610&lt;ref&gt;Northall, G. F. ''English Folk-Rhymes: A collection of traditional verses relating to places and persons, customs, superstitions, etc.'' 1892. pg. 430&lt;/ref&gt;) are common expressions in English speaking countries. The phrase is referenced in the [[General Prologue]] of [[The Canterbury Tales]]: 
"Whan that Aprill, with his shoures soote 
The droghte of March hath perced to the roote".&lt;ref name="Librarius"&gt;{{cite web|title = The Canterbury Tales: General Prologue |url=http://www.librarius.com/cantales/genpro.htm |year=2017 |publisher=Librarius |accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SA Sites.png|thumb|right|A satellite photograph of southern Arabia showing suspected sites of a lost city.]]
'''Atlantis of the Sands''' is the fictional name of a legendary lost city in the southern [[Arabia]]n sands, claimed to have been destroyed by a [[natural disaster]] or as a punishment by God. The search for it was popularised by the 1992 book ''Atlantis of the Sands – The Search for the Lost City of Ubar'' by [[Ranulph Fiennes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nabataea Net|title=The Incense Road: Ubar|url=http://nabataea.net/ubar.html|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various names have been given to this city, the most common being '''Ubar''', '''Wabar''' and '''[[Iram of the Pillars|Iram]]'''.

==Introduction==
In modern times, the mystery of the [[lost city]] of [[Atlantis]] has generated a number of books, films, articles, web pages, and two [[Disney]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlantis: The Lost Empire|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230011/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlantis: Milo's Return|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0344864/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a smaller scale, Arabia has its own legend of a lost city, the so-called "Atlantis of the Sands", which has been the source of debate among historians, archaeologists and explorers, and a degree of controversy that continues to this day.

In February 1992, the ''[[New York Times]]'' announced a major archaeological discovery in the following terms: "Guided by ancient maps and sharp-eyed surveys from space, archaeologists and explorers have discovered a lost city deep in the sands of Arabia, and they are virtually sure it is Ubar, the fabled [[entrepôt]] of the rich [[frankincense]] trade thousands of years ago."&lt;ref&gt;Wilford, J.N., "On the Trail From the Sky: Roads Point to a Lost City", ''New York Times'', 5 February 1992.[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/05/world/on-the-trail-from-the-sky-roads-point-to-a-lost-city.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm]&lt;/ref&gt; When news of this discovery spread quickly around the newspapers of the world, there seemed few people willing or able to challenge the dramatic findings, apart from the Saudi Arabian press.&lt;ref name="RF"&gt;{{Citation

The discovery was the result of the work of a team of archaeologists led by [[Nicholas Clapp]], which had visited and excavated the site of a Bedouin well at Shisr in [[Dhofar]] province, [[Oman]].  The conclusion they reached, based on site excavations and an inspection of satellite photographs, was that this was the site of Ubar, or [[Iram of the Pillars]], a name found in the [[Quran]] which may be a [[lost city]], a tribe or an area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glassé|first=Cyril|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|year=2003|edition=Revised|publisher=AltaMira Press|isbn=978-0759101906|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=focLrox-frUC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Iram+of+the+Pillars&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gPy9T7tH1NzyA7ea2asB&amp;ved=0CG4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Iram%20of%20the%20Pillars&amp;f=false|author2=Huston Smith|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NC"&gt;{{Citation

A contemporary notice at the entrance to an archaeological site at Shisr in the province of Dhofar, Oman, proclaims: "Welcome to Ubar, the Lost City of Bedouin Legend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andyinoman.com/tag/bedouin-legend/ |title=Is "The Lost City of Ubar" Found or Still Lost?!

==Early explorers in Dhofar==
In 1930, the explorer [[Bertram Thomas]] had been approaching the southern edge of the [[Rub' al Khali]] ("The Empty Quarter"). It was Thomas' ambition to be the first European to cross the great sands but, as he began his camel journey, he was told by his [[Bedouin]] escorts of a lost city whose wicked people had attracted the wrath of God and had been destroyed.  He found no trace of a lost city in the sands, but Thomas later related the story to [[T.E. Lawrence]] ("Lawrence of Arabia"), who regarded Ubar as the "Atlantis of the Sands". Thomas marked on a map the location of track that was said to lead to the legendary lost city of Ubar and, although he intended to return to follow it, he was never able to.&lt;ref name="BT"&gt;Thomas, B.S., "Ubar – the Atlantis of the sands of the Rub' al Khali", Journal of the Royal Central Asian Society, 20, pp. 259–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of a lost city in the sands became an explorer's fascination; a few wrote accounts of their travels that perpetuated the tale. T. E. Lawrence planned to search for the location of a lost city somewhere in the sands, telling a fellow traveller that he was convinced that the remains of an Arab civilization were to be found in the desert. He had been told that the Bedu had seen the ruins of the castles of King Ad in the region of [[Iram of the Pillars|Wabar]]. In his view the best way to explore the sands was by airship, but his plans never came to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The English explorer [[Wilfred Thesiger]] visited the well at Shisr in the spring of 1946, "where the ruins of a crude stone fort on a rocky eminence marks the position of this famous well." He noted that some shards found there were possibly early Islamic. The well was the only permanent watering place in those parts and, being a necessary watering place for Bedouin raiders, had been the scene of many fierce encounters in the past,&lt;ref&gt;Thesiger, Wilfred, "A New Journey in Southern Arabia, The Geographical Journal, Vol. CVIII, Oct.-Dec. 1946, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shisr (Ubar)9.jpg|thumb|250px|The remains of the old fort at Shisr.]]

In March 1948 a geological party from [[Petroleum Development Oman|Petroleum Development (Oman and Dhofar) Ltd]], an associate company of the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]], carried out a camel-borne survey of Dhofar province. Like Thesiger, the party approached Shisr from the south, along the Wadi Ghudun. Their first sight of Ash Shisur was a white cliff in the distance.  As they drew closer, they could see that the cliff was in fact the wall of a ruined fort built above a large quarry-like cave, the entrance of which was obscured by a sand dune.&lt;ref name="Morton, Michael Quentin"&gt;{{Citation

The fort had been built from the same white rock as the overhanging cliff, giving the impression of a single structure.  One of the geologists noted:  “There are no houses, tents or people here: only the tumble-down ruin of this pre-Islamic fort.” The geologists, without the benefit of modern satellite analysis or archaeological equipment, were unimpressed by the ruin. Shisur, like Ma Shedid a few days before, was a simply ‘difficult water’ and their escorts spent the best part of their 3-day stay trying to extract water for their camels from the well.&lt;ref name="Morton, Michael Quentin"/&gt;

In 1953, oil man and philanthropist Wendell Phillips set out to discover Thomas' track but was unable to follow it because of the heavy sands which made further travel by motor transport impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

        }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 35 years later, Clapp and his team reported uncovering what they described as a large octagonal fortress dating back some 2,000 years beneath the crumbling fort, and described a vast limestone table that lay beneath the main gate which had collapsed into a massive sinkhole around the well. This, some concluded, was the fabled city of Ubar, which was also known as Iram, or at least a city in the region of Ubar, once an important trading post on the incense route from Dhofar to the Mediterranean region.&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt;

Some pointed to religious texts to support the theory that the city was destroyed as a punishment by God. Iram, for example, was described in the Qur'an as follows: "Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with 'Aad - [with] Iram - who had lofty pillars, The like of which were not produced in (all) the land?" (Surat al-Fajr: 6–8)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islam 101|url=http://www.islam101.com/archeology/ubar.html|work=Ubar, the Lost City|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories about the location of a lost city of the sands==

===Dhofar===
Bertram Thomas' guide pointed to wide tracks between the dunes and said: “Look, Sahib, there is the way to Ubar. It was great in treasure, with date gardens and a fort of red silver. It now lies beneath the sands of the Ramlat Shu’ait.”&lt;ref name="BT"/&gt; Thomas also wrote, "on my previous journeys I had heard from other Arabs of
the name of this Atlantis of the Sands, but none could tell me of even an approximate location."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Bertram|title=A Camel Journey Across the Rub al-Khali|journal=The Geographical Journal|date=September 1931|volume=78|issue=3|pages=209–38|doi=10.2307/1784895}}&lt;!--|accessdate=14 July 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rub' al-Khali===

Most tales of the lost city locate it somewhere in the [[Rub' al Khali]] desert, also known as the Empty Quarter. This covers most of the southern third of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], including most of [[Saudi Arabia]] and areas of [[Oman]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Yemen]]. St. John Philby (who preferred the name "Wabar") was an English adviser to Emir Aziz bin Saud in Riyadh. He first heard the story of Ubar from his Bedouin guide who told him about a place of ruined castles where King Ad had stabled his horses and housed his women before being punished for his sinful ways by being destroyed by fire from heaven.&lt;ref name="Wynn, J.C. 1998, pp. 64-71"&gt;Wynn, J.C., Shoemaker, E.M., "The Day the Sands Caught Fire", Scientific American, Nov. 1998, pp. 64–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anxious to seal his reputation as a great explorer, Philby went in search of the lost city of Wabar but, instead of finding ruins, discovered what he described as extinct volcano half-buried in the sands or, possibly, the remnants of a meteorite impact. Modern research has revealed this latter event to have been the cause of the depression in the sands.&lt;ref name="Wynn, J.C. 1998, pp. 64-71"/&gt;
Geologist [[H. Stewart Edgell]] observed that for the "last six thousand years the Empty Quarter has been continuously a sand-dune desert, presenting a hostile environment where no city could have been built."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edgell|first=H. Stewart|title=The myth of the lost city of the Arabian Sands|journal=Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies|year=2004|volume=34|pages=105–120|jstor=41223810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shisr===
[[Nicholas Clapp]] claimed that the discovery of the remains of towers at the excavation site supported the theory that this was the site of Ubar, the city of 'Ad with "lofty pillars" described in the Qur'an.&lt;ref name="RF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt; Thomas dismissed the ruins at the well of Ash Shisur as a 'rude' fort which he took to be only a few hundred years old.&lt;ref name="BT"/&gt;

===Omanum Emporium===
[[Ranulph Fiennes]], explorer and adventurer, was a member of Clapp's expedition and speculated that Ubar was identified on ancient maps as "Omanum Emporium". This was a place marked on a map of Arabia compiled by [[Claudius Ptolemy]] in about 150 AD.&lt;ref name="RF"/&gt;

===Various===
When the explorer [[Freya Stark]] consulted the works of Arab geographers, she found a wide range of opinions as to the location of Wabar: “Yaqut says: "In Yemen is the qaria of Wabar." El-Laith, quoted by Yaqut, puts it between the sands of Yabrin and Yemen. Ibn Ishaq… places it between "Sabub (unknown to Yaqut and Hamdani) and the Hadhramaut. Hamdani, a very reliable man, places it between Najran, Hadhramaut, Shihr and Mahra. Yaqut, presumably citing Hamdani, puts it between the boundaries of Shihr and San'a, and then, on the authority of Abu Mundhir between the sands of B.Sa'd (near Yabrin) and Shihr and Mahra. Abu Mundhir puts it between Hadhramaut and Najran.”

“With such evidence,” Stark concluded, “it seems quite possible for Mr. Thomas and Mr. Philby each to find Wabar in an opposite corner of Arabia.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Shisr discoveries==
Nicholas Clapp's search for Ubar began after he read Thomas' book ''Arabia Felix''. Clapp had just returned from Oman, having helped to stock an oryx sanctuary on the Jiddat al Harassis, and was inspired by Thomas' references to the lost city of Ubar.
He began his search for Ubar in the library of the [[University of California in Los Angeles]], and found a 2nd-century AD map by the Alexandrian geographer Claudius Ptolemy which showed a place called "Omanum Emporium". He speculated that this might be the location of Ubar, situated on the incense route between Dhofar and the Mediterranean region. Aware that Mayan remains had been identified from aerial photographs, Clapp contacted NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and obtained satellite images of Dhofar. These helped to identify ancient camel tracks hidden beneath the shifting sands of the desert which in turn might identify places of convergence such as wells and ancient cities.&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt;

After Clapp's team had visited a number of possible sites for Ubar, they found themselves drawn back to the crumbling ruin at Shisr. Although the fort had been written off as being no more than a few hundred years old by the earlier explorers, Clapp's team began to speculate that the fort had been rebuilt in the 1500s on the remains of a far more ancient site.

Under the direction of Dr. Juris Zarins, the team began excavation, and within weeks had unearthed the wall and towers of a fortress dating back more than 2,000 years. Clapp suggested that the evidence was "a convincing match" for the legendary lost city of Ubar. The city's destruction, he postulated, happened between A.D. 300 and 500 as the result of an earthquake which precipitated the collapse of the limestone table; but it was the decline of the incense trade, which led to the decline of the caravan routes through Shisr, that sealed Ubar's fate.

Zarins himself concluded that Shisr did not represent a city called Ubar.&lt;ref&gt;Jurins, Z., "Atlantis of the Sands" in Archaeology (1997): 51—53&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1996 interview, on the subject of Ubar, he said: “There's a lot of confusion about that word. If you look at the classical texts and the Arab historical sources, Ubar refers to a region and a group of people, not to a specific town. People always overlook that. It's very clear on Ptolemy’s second century map of the area. It says in big letters "Iobaritae" And in his text that accompanied the maps, he's very clear about that. It was only the late medieval version of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', in the fourteenth or fifteenth century, that romanticised Ubar and turned it into a city, rather than a region or a people."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ubar/zarins/  Interview with Dr J. Zarins, Nova Online, Sept. 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more recent paper he suggested that modern Habarut may be the site of Ubar.&lt;ref&gt;"Environmental Disruption and Human Response," in Environmental Disaster and the Archaeology of Human Response, Anthropological Papers, ed. Garth Bawden and Richard M. Reycraft (Albuquerque: Maxwell Museum of Anthropology, University of New Mexico, 2000), 7:35—49.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, following further research and excavation, their findings could be summarised as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Blom, R., Crippen, R., Elachi, C., Clapp, N., Hedges, G., Zarins, J., “Southern Arabian Desert Trade Routes, Frankincense, Myrrh, and the Ubar Legend” in Remote Sensing in Archaeology, Interdisciplinary Contributions to Archaeology (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

* A long period of widespread trade through the area of Shisr was indicated by artefacts from Persia, Rome, and Greece being found on the site. More recent work in Oman and Yemen indicated that this fortress was the easternmost remains of a series of desert caravansaries that supported incense trade.
* As far as the legend of Ubar was concerned, there was no evidence that the city had perished in a sandstorm. Much of the fortress had collapsed into a sinkhole that hosted the well, perhaps undermined by ground water being taken to irrigate the surrounding oasis.
* Rather than being a city, interpretation of the evidence suggested that “Ubar” was more likely to have been a region—the “Land of the Iobaritae” identified by Ptolemy. The decline of the region was probably due to a reduction in the frankincense trade caused by the conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity, which did not require incense in the same quantities for its rituals. Also, it became difficult to find local labour to collect the resin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawton|first1=John|title=Oman: Frankincense|journal=Aramco World|date=May–June 1983|volume=34|issue=3|pages=26–27|url=https://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198303/oman-frankincense.htm|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climatic changes led to desiccation of the area, and sea transport became a more reliable way of transporting goods.
* The archaeological importance of the site was highlighted by satellite imagery that revealed a network of trails, some of which passed underneath sand dunes 100 m tall, which converged on Shisr. Image analysis showed no further evidence of major undocumented sites in this desert region, which might be considered as alternate locations for the Ubar of legend.

==Critical reception==
The Saudi Arabian press was generally sceptical about the discovery of Ubar in Oman, with Dr. Abdullah al Masri, Assistant Under-Secretary of Archaeological Affairs stating that similar sites had been found in Saudi Arabia over the past 15 years.  In ''Ashawq al Awsat'' he explained: “The best of these sites was when, in 1975, we uncovered more than one city on the edge of the Empty Quarter, in particular the oasis on Jabreen. Also the name of Ubar is similar to that of Obar, an oasis in eastern Saudi Arabia. We must await further details but so far we have far more important discoveries at Jabreen or Najran.” However, Professor Mohammed Bakalla of King Saud University wrote that he would not be surprised if Ad’s nation cities were found underneath the Shisr excavation or in the close vicinity.&lt;ref name="RF"/&gt;

More recent academic opinion is less than convinced about the accuracy of Clapp’s findings. One reviewer noted that Clapp himself did not help matters by including a speculative chapter about the king of Ubar in his book, ''The Road to Ubar'', which in his view undermined his narrative authority: “its fictional drama pales next to the gripping real-life story of the Ubar expedition recounted in earlier portions of this volume.”&lt;ref&gt;Review of the Road To Ubar (Finding the Atlantis of the Sands) by Nicholas Clapp (Houghton Mifflin, 1997) Copyright 1998 The New York Times Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

The case for Shisr being Omanum Emporium has been questioned by recent research.  Nigel Groom commented in an article “Oman and the Emirates in Ptolemy's Map” published in 2007, that Ptolemy’s map of Arabia contained many wild distortions.  The word “Emporium” in the original Greek meant a place for wholesale trade of commodities carried by sea, and was sometimes an inland city where taxes were collected and trade conducted. Thus the term could be applied to a town that was some distance from the coast. This, Groom suggests, may have been the case with Ptolemy’s ’Omanum Emporium’. He suggested that the Hormanus River, the source of which is marked on Ptolemy’s map as being north-east of Omanus Emporium, was in fact the Wadi Halfrain which rises some 20 kilometres north east of Izki in modern-day central Oman. Thus, Groom concludes, Omanum Emprorium was likely to have been located at Izki, possibly Nizwa, or in their vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;Groom, N. (1994), “Oman and the Emirates in Ptolemy's map”, Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy, 5: 198–214.&lt;/ref&gt;

H. Stewart Edgell contended that Ubar is essentially mythical and makes arguments against any significant historical role for Shisr beyond that of a small caravansary. Edgell suggested that the building was small and used by a few families at most. He believed that all the “discovery” of Ubar showed was how easily scientists can succumb to wishful thinking.&lt;ref&gt;"The Myth of the 'Lost City of the Arabian Sands'" in Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies (2004), 34:105—20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article on the Shisr excavations entitled "On the Incense Trail: The Empty Quarter to the Indian Ocean, In Search of the City of 'Ubar'",&lt;ref&gt;Minerva vol. 3, No. 4 (July–August 1992), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Barri Jones]] wrote: "The archaeological integrity of the site should not be allowed to be affected by possible disputes regarding its name." A 2001 report for [[UNESCO]] states: "The Oasis of Shisr and the entrepots of Khor Rori and Al-Balid are outstanding examples of medieval fortified settlements in the Persian Gulf region." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Original Decision Document – World Heritage – UNESCO|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/2000/whc-00-conf204-21e.pdf|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing about 'Wabbar', Michael Macdonald expressed doubts about the "discovery" since the site was known for decades and Sir Ranulph was stationed there.&lt;ref&gt;"Wabbar" in J. Sasson, Civilization of the Ancient Near East, 8, London, p. 1351.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CamNeMap.png|thumb|The Da Nang area, with Cam Ne indicated in red]]

The '''Cam Ne incident''' was a [[Vietnam War]] incident involving U.S. military and South Vietnamese civilians that occurred at the village of Cam Ne in [[Quảng Nam Province]], [[South Vietnam]], and became one of the top news stories in the United States about the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Top 100 Works of Journalism In the United States in the 20th Century|url=https://www.nyu.edu/classes/stephens/Top%20100%20page.htm|publisher=Department of Journalism, New York University|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
In the summer of 1965, U.S. Marines were patrolling southwest of the city of [[Da Nang]]. Units of the [[1st Battalion, 9th Marines#Vietnam War|1st Battalion, 9th Marines]] were operating around Cam Ne. On July 12, the Marines received fire from a [[Viet Cong]] (VC) force coming from the hamlet of Cam Ne 4 (numbered in order to identify it in the complex of six villages of the same name). Patrolling in the area continued during July and into August. The Americans claimed Cam Ne to be a VC stronghold and its residents Communist sympathizers. Commonplace military procedure for US forces when villages or areas were generally uncooperative or hostile were to burn down the villages and rounding up civilians for deportation to refugee camps in urban areas or [[South Vietnam|RVN-controlled]] areas.&lt;ref name=herring&gt;{{cite web|title=How Not To Win Hearts and Minds|last1=Herring|first1=George|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/opinion/vietnam-war-americans-culture.html|website=New York Times|date=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 August 1965, Company D, 1/9 Marines was sent to Cam Ne in support of Operation Blastout with orders to destroy the VC forces and their fortifications, including any structures from which they received fire. As the Marines moved into Cam Ne they were met with sporadic fire, wounding one Marine, but the VC withdrew, refusing to stand and fight. The entire village was extensively entrenched and fortified and the Marines found 267 [[Punji stick]] traps, 3 grenade booby traps and 6 anti-personnel mines. The Marines then proceeded to destroy 51 huts and 38 trenches, tunnels and fighting positions. With dusk approaching the Marines began to withdraw and again came under fire from the VC, the Marines then called in an artillery and mortar barrage and 4 105mm shells and 21 81mm mortar rounds hit the VC positions.&lt;ref name=Shulimson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shulimson|first1=Jack|title=U.S. Marines in Vietnam : The Landing and the Buildup 1965|date=1978|publisher=U.S. Marine Corps History and Museums Division|url=https://archive.org/details/TheLandingAndTheBuildup|isbn=9781494287559|page=62-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The CBS Report===
[[CBS]] news correspondent [[Morley Safer]] was in Da Nang to report on Marine activities. On 3 August Safer joined the Marines headed for Cam Ne. Safer was accompanied by a South Vietnamese cameraman, Ha Tue Can. The operation at Cam Ne was filmed by Can and narrated by Safer. The film showed a Marine, armed with a rifle, lighting a hut with his cigarette lighter. No opposition was evident. According to Safer's report the Marines were under orders to burn to the ground any hamlet from which they receive even a single burst of sniper fire. Old men and women who were pleading for the Marines to spare their houses were ignored. The houses and personal belongings were burned. Pleas from the villagers to delay while their possessions were removed were ignored. All rice stores were burned. The day's operation netted four prisoners, all of whom were old men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Invitation to Return to Cam Ne|journal=Saturday Review|date=4 September 1965|page=16|url=http://www.unz.com/print/SaturdayRev-1965sep04-00016/|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS realized they had an important and powerful story as soon as it was received in New York. CBS News President Fred Friendly confirmed the validity of the story with Safer. The images were shocking, but the network felt the story was important and should be shown. The incident was broadcast on CBS Evening News on August 5, 1965.

Reaction to the Cam Ne report was immediate and powerful. CBS was inundated with calls and letters critical of this negative portrayal of American military personnel. The day after the film was broadcast, U. S. President Lyndon Johnson telephoned CBS President Frank Stanton to complain the report insulted the American flag. The President ordered a background investigation on Safer, certain he was working for the Communists. No such affiliation was found. LBJ next ordered an investigation of the Marine officer in charge of the Cam Ne operation, certain Safer must have bribed the Marine to burn Cam Ne. Nothing came of this either. The Pentagon asked CBS to replace Safer as Vietnam correspondent. The Department of Defense began monitoring the evening television newscasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wyatt|first1=Clarence|title=Paper Soldiers : The American Press and the Vietnam|date=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safer followed up his initial report with additional broadcasts critical of Marine operations in the area. The commander of the Marines in Vietnam, Major General [[Lewis William Walt#Vietnam War|Lew Walt]], banned Safer from all of [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]], the Marine Corps area of responsibility in South Vietnam (the order was later rescinded).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brush|first1=Peter|title=What Really Happened at Cam Ne|url=http://www.historynet.com/what-really-happened-at-cam-ne.htm|website=HistoryNet|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days that followed, the U.S. media carried additional stories of the impact of Marine operations on South Vietnamese civilians around Da Nang.

===The Marine Corps perspective===
The huts were burned to ensure they would not be reused by VC forces after the Americans moved on. The Viet Cong force estimated to be between 30 and 100 strong had fired upon the Marines as they withdrew from the village. Four Marines were wounded and one Vietnamese child were killed in the fighting. No enemy bodies were found; the Marines assumed they carried off their dead.&lt;ref name=Shulimson/&gt;{{rp|63–4}} The Marines used great force on August 3 at Cam Ne because they expected it to be occupied by Viet Cong soldiers. They had taken casualties there the previous month. They felt the CBS report was distorted and were critical of CBS for telling only part of the story.&lt;ref&gt;''Marine Corps Gazette'', Vol.49,  No. 10, October 1965, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August, another Marine unit operating near Cam Ne came under enemy fire: two Marines were killed and more than twenty were wounded. The Marines decided to complete the job of securing the area. On 18 August the Marines returned in force, but this time, the villagers were given full warning. In addition to searching Cam Ne, the Marines built shelters for Vietnamese civilians. The entire village was cleared. No VC were found in Cam Ne and there were no casualties.&lt;ref name=Shulimson/&gt;{{rp|64-5}}&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt;{{rp|195}}

== Conclusion ==
Although American military commanders{{who|date=August 2018}} considered Safer's report both distorted and incomplete, they were not unresponsive to it.&lt;ref name=Hammond&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hammond|first1=William|title=Public Affairs : the Military and the Media, 1962-1968|date=1988|publisher=Center of Military History, United States. Army|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=28-29|url=https://history.army.mil/html/books/091/91-13/CMH_Pub_91-13-B.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{notincitationgiven|date=August 2018}} They realized killing civilians and destruction of village property had serious consequences in a struggle where winning hearts and minds was an essential component of military victory.{{cn|date = August 2018}}{{explain|date=August 2018}}

Over a year later during two Operation County Fair a joint US-ARVN sweep of the village complex (not necessarily the same village as Cam Ne refers to a set of six villages) on 17 March 1966, [[3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines#Search and Destroy Near Da Nang (1965–1966)|3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines]] claiming to have killed 2 VC in the village and captured a suspected VC nurse and held 13 others for questioning an found two ARVN deserters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shulimson|first=Jack|title=U.S. Marines in Vietnam: An Expanding War 1966|publisher=History and Museums Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps|year=1982|url=https://archive.org/details/AnExpandingWar|isbn=9781494285159|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to balance its initial, critical reports, subsequent CBS reports presented positive aspects of Marine operations in the Cam Ne area. [[COMUSMACV]] General [[William Westmoreland]] ordered the preparation of new guidelines concerning contact between U.S. military forces and Vietnamese civilians{{CN|date=August 2018}}. Published in September 1968 nearly 3 years after the event, the rules forbade indiscriminate destruction of populated areas {{clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}}. When possible, villagers were to receive advance warning of upcoming assaults. South Vietnamese troops would accompany the American forces to assist in searching dwellings and communicating with civilians. Although the Pentagon considered censoring American journalists reporting from Vietnam, the plans were never adopted.&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt;{{rp|195}}

'''Charles Augustus Leale''' (March 26, 1842 – June 13, 1932) was a surgeon in the Union Army during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WWZsBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=Charles+Augustus+Leale+1842&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMkPTYjeHQAhWhjFQKHex2ACsQ6AEIHTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Charles+Augustus+Leale+1842&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of Civil War Medicine|first=Glenna R.|last=Schroeder-Lein|date=28 January 2015|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=25 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was the first doctor to arrive at the presidential box at [[Ford's Theatre]] on April 14, 1865 after [[John Wilkes Booth]]
fatally shot President [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the back of the head with a [[Derringer#Philadelphia Deringer|Philadelphia Deringer]] pistol. His quick efforts temporarily saved President Lincoln's life, which allowed Lincoln to live until the next morning. Charles Leale continued to serve in the army until 1866. He then returned to his home town of New York City where he established a successful private practice and became involved in charitable medical care. One of the last surviving witnesses to Lincoln’s death, Dr. Charles A. Leale died in 1932 at the age of 90.

==Early life==

==Assassination of Lincoln==
At the time, Leale was a 23-year-old surgeon in charge of the Wounded Commissioned Officers' Ward at the United States Army General Hospital in Armory Square, [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;Leale, Charles. Lincoln's Last Hours. 1909. [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/24088/24088-h/24088-h.htm Project Gutenberg]&lt;/ref&gt; Just six weeks earlier, he'd graduated in medicine from Bellevue Hospital Medical College in [[New York City]]. He married a daughter of [[Yonkers, New York]], industrialist John Copcutt (1805–1895) at the historic [[John Copcutt Mansion]].&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10778|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: John Copcutt Mansion|date=July 1985|accessdate=2010-12-24 |author=Neil G. Larson|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days before [[Lincoln's assassination]], Leale took a brief break from his exhausting job and took a walk down [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]] for some fresh air. He noticed a crowd of people heading towards the [[White House]]. He discovered Lincoln giving his last public address to the public and was intrigued by the president's facial features. Soon after, Leale learned that Lincoln was going to Ford's Theatre to see the play ''Our American Cousin''. "After completing his duties...Leale changed to civilian clothes and rushed to the Theater, not to see the play, but to study President Lincoln's face and facial expressions."&lt;ref&gt;Helen Leale Harper, "Dr. Charles A Leale: First Surgeon to Reach the Assassinated President Lincoln," September 28, 2009 [http://www.yonkershistory.org/leale.html Yonkers Historical Society Newsletter Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227141627/http://www.yonkershistory.org/leale.html |date=2012-02-27 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; He asked for a seat in the orchestra so he would have an unhindered view, but arrived late and was given a seat in the dress circle (near the front, same side and 40&amp;nbsp;ft away from the president's box).

There was an interruption in the play when Lincoln arrived. The orchestra played "Hail to the Chief" and the audience gave a standing ovation. Leale could see the full face of the president as he stood only a few aisles behind him. What was to be a short observation of the president's face would turn into nine hours of close doctoring for Charles Leale. When John Wilkes Booth jumped down from the presidential box to the stage. Leale stated that Booth "ran to the opposite side of the stage, flourishing in his hand a drawn dagger and vanishing behind the scene." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/07/us/lincoln-document-assasination/|title=Newly discovered document sheds light on Lincoln's last hours - CNN|first=By Dugald McConnell and Brian Todd,|last=CNN|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leale's statement of Booth running across the stage is an enforcer of Michael Kauffman's idea in "American Brutus," that Booth did not break his leg from the fall from the banister, but rather from a fall off his horse as he fled.&lt;ref&gt;''American Brutus,'' Michael Kauffman&lt;/ref&gt; Leale, seeing this, immediately rushed to the president's box. When he arrived, he saw Lincoln slumped in his armchair supported by Mrs. Lincoln, who was weeping frantically. Leale received permission to take charge. He found the President unresponsive, barely breathing and with no detectable pulse: "His eyes were closed and he was in a profoundly comatose condition, while his breathing was intermittent and exceedingly stertorous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/report-first-doctor-reach-shot-lincoln-found-175353998.html|title=Report of first doctor to reach shot Lincoln found}}&lt;/ref&gt; He laid the president down on the floor and initially thinking that Lincoln had been stabbed in the shoulder, searched for wounds. Finding none, he further detected that Lincoln's eyes were dilated and finally found "a large clot of blood about one inch below the superior curved line and an inch and a half to the left of the median line of the occipital bone in the back of the skull,"&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. R. Fraser, "How Did Lincoln Die?," American Heritage Magazine February/March 1995 [http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1995/1/1995_1_63.shtml "How Did Lincoln Die?"]&lt;/ref&gt; that showed that he had been shot. Leale attempted to remove the bullet, but the bullet was too deep in his head and instead Leale dislodged a clot of blood in the wound. Consequently, Lincoln's breathing improved.&lt;ref name=steers&gt;[[Edward Steers, Jr.|Steers, Edward]]. ''Blood on the Moon: The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln''. University Press of Kentucky, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-8131-9151-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|121–22}} Leale learned that if he continued to release more blood clots at a specific time, Lincoln would breathe more naturally. He allowed actress [[Laura Keene]] to cradle the president's head in her lap. His assessment of the dire condition of the president ("his wound is mortal; it is impossible for him to recover") was announced to the entire country.

Army surgeon Dr. [[Charles S. Taft]] and Dr. Albert F. A. King of Washington then joined Leale and conceded that Lincoln would not survive a carriage ride back to the White House. Leale ordered that Lincoln be moved to the [[Petersen House]] across the street so that he could rest in comfort. Leale gave control over the president to the Lincoln family physician, [[Robert K. Stone]], and the commander of the Armory Square Hospital, D. W. Bliss. Lincoln was placed on a bed diagonally, for his 6'4" body was too long to fit lengthwise. He remained in a coma for approximately nine hours before passing away at 7:22 the next morning. Lincoln never regained consciousness. For most of the night, Leale held the comatose president's hand with a firm grip, "to let him know that he was in touch with humanity and had a friend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steers|title=Blood on the Moon|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some accounts, at his last drawn breath, on the morning after the assassination, he smiled broadly and then expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fox|first1=Richard|title=Lincoln's Body: A Cultural History|date=2015|publisher=W.

==Later life==
Although Leale submitted a report in 1867 to Representative Benjamin F. Butler's House commission investigating the assassination, Leale's account of Lincoln's death was not publicly revealed until the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Leale to Benjamin F. Butler, July 20th, 1867, Benjamin Butler Papers, Manuscript Division, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., box 43&lt;/ref&gt; In that year Leale spoke on "Lincoln's Last Hour" to the New York commandery of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Leale, Lincoln's Last Hours: Address Delivered Before the Commandery of the State of New York Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (New York: Privately published, 1909) Project Gutenberg https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/0/8/24088/ (accessed July 27, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; His 1865 written report to the [[Surgeon General of the United States]] was thought lost until 2008, when a 22-page photocopy was found in the [[Georgetown University]] Library and published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Leale was one of the last surviving attendees of Lincoln's assassination upon his death in 1932 at the age of 90.

'''Charles Pearre Cabell''' (October 11, 1903 – May 25, 1971) was a [[United States Air Force]] [[General officer|General]] and [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (1953–1962).

==Early life==
He was the son of Ben E. (son of Confederate general [[William L. Cabell]]) and Sadie E. (Pearre) Cabell and attended [[W. H. Adamson High School|Oak Cliff High School]] in Dallas, Texas. He graduated from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] in 1925. He was initially commissioned as an [[artillery]] lieutenant and served in the [[field artillery]] until 1931, when he went to flying school, and was transferred to the [[U.S. Army Air Corps|Air Corps]].  He served in a variety of aviation roles as a staff officer and squadron commander throughout the pre-war years, primarily in observation and pursuit squadrons.  His observation roles led naturally to his later involvement in photographic and intelligence roles.

Cabell achieved the rank of colonel in 1942 and brigadier general in 1944, serving both at air force headquarters at the Pentagon and in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theater]]. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, he held a variety of staff headquarters positions, including chief of Air Force Intelligence 1948-1951, and [[Director of the Joint Staff|director of the staff]] for the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] from 1951-1953.

In 1949, Cabell set up [[Project Grudge]] to "make a study reviewing the [[UFO]] situation for AF HQ." However, Grudge quickly became all but moribund, while simultaneously reporting that all UFO cases were being closely investigated. When Cabell learned of this, he ordered Grudge dissolved and ordered that the "open minded"&lt;ref&gt;Albert A. Harrison, ''Starstruck: Cosmic visions in science, religion, and folklore'', p. 40, New York: Berghahn Books, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Project Blue Book]] be created.

In November 1951, he was named director of the Joint Staff for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} During this time, he was promoted to Lieutenant General.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1952, he was an enthusiastic promoter of the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane, along with [[Allen Welsh Dulles]] and [[John Foster Dulles]].

==CIA career==
On April 23, 1953, while still an active air force officer, he was appointed [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director]] of the CIA under [[Allen Dulles]]. In 1956, along with the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s [[Richard M. Bissell, Jr.|Richard Bissell]], he flew to [[Bonn]], to brief the West German Chancellor, [[Konrad Adenauer]], on the U-2 program. Adenauer allowed U-2 planes, pilots, and support teams to be based at [[Wiesbaden, Germany|Wiesbaden]]. He was promoted to full general in 1958.

Cabell was forced to resign as Deputy Director by [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] on January 31, 1962, following the failure of the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;"Will Retire", ''The Washington Post'', January 23, 1962, p. A2. "McCone Is Confirmed for C.I.A.; Fulbright Dissents in 71-12 Vote", ''New York Times'', February 1, 1962, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Cabell's brother, [[Earle Cabell]], was Mayor of Dallas when Kennedy visited that city and was assassinated, on November 22, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;"Gen. Charles Cabell Dies, Former CIA Deputy Director", ''The Washington Post'', May 27, 1971, p. B7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
General Cabell died in 1971, four years before his brother Earle.

==Conspiracy theories==
One hypothesis regarding the assassination of U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], has to do with the so-called [[Renegade CIA Clique]]", where one attempts to implicate Cabell and several other CIA officials, including [[James Jesus Angleton]] and [[William King Harvey]], as well as the "[[three tramps]]",  and Cabell's brother [[Earle Cabell]].&lt;ref name="Entertainment; January 17, 1992"&gt;{{cite news |last=Catchpole |first=Terry |date=January 17, 1992 |title=Nine JFK assassination theories |url=http://ew.com/article/1992/01/17/nine-jfk-assassination-theories/ |department= |work=Entertainment |access-date=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Jim Garrison]]'s 1973 bribery trial, tape recordings from March 1971 revealed that Garrison considered publicly implicating Cabell of conspiracy in the assassination after learning he was the brother of the Dallas mayor.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post; September 16, 1973"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kelso |authorlink=Iris Kelso |first=Iris |date=September 16, 1973 |title=Garrison Planned To Link General To JFK Slaying |url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/G%20Disk/Garrison%20Jim/Garrison%20Jim%20Criminal%20Trial%201973/Item%20127.pdf |work=The Washington Post |location=Washington, D.C. |page=E 10 |access-date=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorizing that a plot to kill the President was masterminded out of New Orleans in conjunction with the CIA with cooperation from the Dallas police department and city government, Garrison tasked his chief investigator, Pershing Gervais, of looking into the possibility that Cabell had stayed in the city's Fontainebleau Motel at the time of the assassination.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post; September 16, 1973"/&gt; ''The Washington Post'' reported that there was no evidence that Gervais ever followed through with the request and that there was no further mention of Cabell in Garrison's investigation.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post; September 16, 1973"/&gt;

==Personal==
Cabell was married to Jacklyn DeHymel in 1934; they had two sons, Charles P. Cabell, Jr. and Benjamin Cabell IV, and one daughter, Catharine C. Bennett. He left an [[autobiography]] "A Man of Intelligence: Memoirs of War, Peace and the CIA" published in 1997. His oldest son Charles was also an Air Force officer and West Point graduate (Class of 1958), achieving the rank of brigadier general.

He was a tenth-generation descendant of [[Pocahontas]] and a third cousin of [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[List of United States Navy four-star admirals|four-star admiral]] [[Richard H. Jackson]].&lt;ref name=cabell&gt;{{citation

'''Chennai Sangamam''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: சென்னை சங்கமம்) is a large annual open [[Tamil people|Tamil]] cultural festival held in the city of [[Chennai]]. The festival is organized by the Tamil Maiyam and Department of Tourism and Culture of the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]] with the intention of rejuvenating the old village festivals, art and artists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chennaisangamam.com/Ideals.html/ Ideals of Chennai Sangamam&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is centered on the occasion of Tamil [[harvest festival]] of [[Pongal]], and takes place for a week-long period. The festival is conceived to be the longest and biggest open Festival in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chennaisangamam.com/Home.html/ Chennai Sangamam&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The idea of organizing a festival during Pongal showcasing the culture of [[Tamil Nadu]] was conceived by [[Kanimozhi]], Member of Parliament from Tamil Nadu and daughter of [[Muthuvel Karunanidhi|M Karunanidhi]] and Rev.[[Fr. Jegath Gaspar Raj]], founder of Tamil Maiyam, in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chennaisangamam.com/Story.html/ Chennai Sangamam history&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was rolled out in 2007, with patronization of the Government of Tamil Nadu.

== Festival description ==

The festival is organized at various places in [[Chennai city]] including beaches, parks, corporation grounds, college / school grounds and shopping malls. The idea to have it in the open parks, beaches and streets was an inspiration from the Bengaluru Habba celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chennaisangamam.com/Story.html/ Inspiration from Bengaluru Habba Celebrations&lt;/ref&gt; The events that mark the festival include traditional and folk music shows folk dances, martial arts, classical music and dance performances, street plays, drama / theater, etc. Apart from these, food component got added in the second edition of Chennai Sangamam in 2008 where food outlets catering traditional [[Tamil cuisine]] also became part of the celebrations. More than 2,000 performers take part in the event which accommodates around 4,000 performances annually.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chennaisangamam.com/Home.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Khaki-chums-xmas-truce-1914-1999.redvers.jpg|thumb|A cross, left in Saint-Yves (Saint-Yvon – Ploegsteert; Comines-Warneton in Belgium) in 1999, to commemorate the site of the Christmas Truce. The text reads:&lt;br /&gt;"1914 – The Khaki Chum's Christmas Truce – 1999 – 85 Years – Lest We Forget"]]
The '''Christmas truce''' ({{lang-de|Weihnachtsfrieden}}; {{lang-fr|Trêve de Noël}}) was a series of widespread but unofficial ceasefires along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] of [[World War I]] around Christmas 1914.

The Christmas truce occurred during the relatively early period of the war (month 5 of 51). Hostilities had entered somewhat of a lull as leadership on both sides reconsidered their strategies following the stalemate of the [[Race to the Sea]] and the indecisive result of the [[First Battle of Ypres]]. In the week leading up to the 25th, [[French Third Republic|French]], [[German Empire|German]], and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] soldiers crossed trenches to exchange seasonal greetings and talk. In some areas, men from both sides ventured into [[no man's land]] on [[Christmas Eve]] and [[Christmas Day]] to mingle and exchange food and souvenirs. There were joint burial ceremonies and prisoner swaps, while several meetings ended in carol-singing. Men played games of football with one another,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/10455611/England-v-Germany-when-rivals-staged-beautiful-game-on-the-Somme.html "England v Germany: when rivals staged beautiful game on the Somme"]&lt;/ref&gt; giving one of the most memorable images of the truce. Peaceful behaviour was not ubiquitous; fighting continued in some sectors, while in others the sides settled on little more than arrangements to recover bodies.

The following year, a few units arranged ceasefires but the truces were not nearly as widespread as in 1914; this was, in part, due to strongly worded orders from the high commands of both sides prohibiting truces. Soldiers were no longer amenable to truce by 1916. The war had become increasingly bitter after devastating human losses suffered during the battles of [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]] and [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and the use of [[Chemical weapons in World War I|poison gas]].

The truces were not unique to the Christmas period, and reflected a mood of "[[live and let live (World War I)|live and let live]]", where infantry close together would stop overtly aggressive behaviour and often engage in small-scale fraternisation, engaging in conversation or bartering for cigarettes. In some sectors, there would be occasional ceasefires to allow soldiers to go between the lines and recover wounded or dead comrades, while in others, there would be a tacit agreement not to shoot while men rested, exercised or worked in full view of the enemy. The Christmas truces were particularly significant due to the number of men involved and the level of their participation — even in very peaceful sectors, dozens of men openly congregating in daylight was remarkable — and are often seen as a symbolic moment of peace and humanity amidst one of the most violent events of human history.

== Background ==

During the first five months of World War I, the German attack through [[Belgium]] into France had been repelled outside Paris by French and British troops at the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] in early September 1914. The Germans fell back to the [[Aisne river|Aisne valley]], where they prepared defensive positions. In the subsequent [[First Battle of the Aisne|Battle of the Aisne]], the Allied forces were unable to push through the German line, and the fighting quickly degenerated into a stalemate; neither side was willing to give ground, and both started to develop fortified systems of [[trench warfare|trenches]]. To the north, on the right of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]], there had been no defined front line, and both sides quickly began to try to use this gap to outflank one another. In the ensuing "[[Race to the Sea]]", the two sides repeatedly clashed, each trying to push forward and threaten the end of the other's line. After several months of fighting, during which the British forces were withdrawn from the Aisne and sent north into [[Flanders]], the northern flank had developed into a similar stalemate. By November, there was a continuous [[front line]] running from the [[North Sea]] to the Swiss frontier, occupied on both sides by armies in prepared defensive positions.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (2005), pp. 13–15&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lead up to Christmas 1914, there were several peace initiatives. The [[Open Christmas Letter]] was a public message for [[peace]] addressed "To the Women of Germany and [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]]", signed by a group of 101 British women [[suffragette]]s at the end of 1914 as the first Christmas of World War I approached.&lt;ref&gt;Oldfield, Sybil.

Volume 2 of ''International Woman Suffrage: Jus Suffragii, 1913–1920'', Sybil Oldfield, {{ISBN|0-415-25736-0}} p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, David S.

Routledge, 2008. {{ISBN|0-415-96142-4}} p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XV]], on 7 December 1914, had begged for an official truce between the warring governments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatwar.nl/frames/default-christmastruce.html "Demystifying the Christmas Truce"], Thomas Löwer, The Heritage of the Great War, retrieved 27 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He asked "that the guns may fall silent at least upon the night the angels sang."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harrisondailytimes.com/articles/2009/12/25/opinion/editorials/doc4b32bc259368c715520590.txt "Miracles brighten Christmas"], Harrison Daily Times, 24 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This attempt was officially rebuffed.&lt;ref name="Victory For Human Kindness"/&gt;

==Fraternisation==

{{Main|Live and let live (World War I)|l1=Live and let live}}
Fraternisation—peaceful and sometimes friendly interactions between opposing forces—was a regular feature in quiet front-line sectors of the Western Front. In some areas, it manifested as a passive inactivity, where both sides would refrain from overtly aggressive or threatening behaviour, while in other cases it extended to regular conversation or even visits from one trench to another.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (2000), pp. 18–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Truces between British and German units can be dated to early November 1914, around the time opposing armies had begun static trench warfare. At this time, both sides' rations were brought up to the front line after dusk, and soldiers on both sides noted a period of peace while they collected their food.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (2000), pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; By 1 December, a British soldier could record a friendly visit from a German sergeant one morning "to see how we were getting on".&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (2000), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between French and German units were generally more tense, but the same phenomenon began to emerge. In early December, a German surgeon recorded a regular half-hourly truce each evening to recover dead soldiers for burial, during which French and German soldiers exchanged newspapers.&lt;ref name="Catastrophe 2013"&gt;''Catastrophe: Europe Goes To War'', Max Hastings. William Collins 2013. [Page not given]&lt;/ref&gt; This behaviour was often challenged by junior and senior officers; the young [[Charles de Gaulle]] wrote on 7 December of the "lamentable" desire of French infantrymen to leave the enemy in peace, while the commander of [[10th Army (France)|10th Army]], [[Victor d'Urbal]], wrote of the "unfortunate consequences" when men "become familiar with their neighbours opposite".&lt;ref name="Catastrophe 2013"/&gt; Other truces could be enforced on both sides by weather conditions, especially when trench lines flooded in low-lying areas,&lt;ref name="Catastrophe 2013"/&gt; though these often lasted after the weather had cleared.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (2000), p. 36; ''Catastrophe: Europe Goes To War'', Max Hastings. William Collins 2013. [Page not given]&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], [[Fritz Kreisler]] reported incidents of spontaneous truces and fraternisation between the Austro-Hungarians and Russians in the first few weeks of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Kreisler, Fritz. Four Weeks in the Trenches. Accessed January 23, 2018. http://www.gwpda.org/memoir/Kreisler/Kreisler.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proximity of trench lines made it easy for soldiers to shout greetings to each other, and this may have been the most common method of arranging informal truces during 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (2000), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Men would frequently exchange news or greetings, helped by a common language; many German soldiers had lived in England, particularly London, and were familiar with the language and the culture. Several British soldiers recorded instances of Germans asking about news from the football leagues, while other conversations could be as banal as discussions of the weather or as plaintive as messages for a sweetheart.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (2000), pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt; One unusual phenomenon that grew in intensity was music; in peaceful sectors, it was not uncommon for units to sing in the evenings, sometimes deliberately with an eye towards entertaining or gently taunting their opposite numbers. This shaded gently into more festive activity; in early December, [[Edward Hulse, 7th Baronet|Sir Edward Hulse]] of the [[Scots Guards]] wrote that he was planning to organise a concert party for Christmas Day, which would "give the enemy every conceivable form of song in harmony" in response to frequent choruses of ''[[Deutschland Über Alles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (2000), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christmas 1914==
&lt;!--{{expand|date=December 2010}}--&gt;
[[File:Christmas Truce 1914.png|thumb|right|British and German troops meeting in [[no man's land]] during the unofficial truce (British troops from the [[Northumberland Hussars]], 7th Division, Bridoux-Rouge Banc Sector)]]

Roughly 100,000 British and German troops were involved in the unofficial cessations of hostility along the Western Front.&lt;ref name="The Truce of Christmas"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/weekinreview/25word.ready.html?pagewanted=all "The Truce of Christmas, 1914"], [[Thomas Vinciguerra]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 25 December 2005.{{Dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first truce started on Christmas Eve 1914, when German troops decorated the area around their [[trench warfare|trenches]] in the region of [[Ypres]], Belgium and particularly in Saint-Yvon (called Saint-Yves, in Plugstreet/Ploegsteert – Comines-Warneton), where Capt. [[Bruce Bairnsfather]] described the truce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/27080/ |title=All Together Now for England|date= 27 December 2009 |accessdate=7 January 2010 |publisher=[[The Epoch Times]] |author= Bridget Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans placed candles on their trenches and on Christmas trees, then continued the celebration by singing [[Christmas carol]]s. The British responded by singing carols of their own. The two sides continued by shouting Christmas greetings to each other. Soon thereafter, there were excursions across No Man's Land, where small gifts were exchanged, such as food, tobacco and alcohol, and souvenirs such as buttons and hats. The [[artillery]] in the region fell silent. The truce also allowed a breathing spell where recently killed soldiers could be brought back behind their lines by burial parties. Joint services were held. In many sectors, the truce lasted through Christmas night, continuing until [[New Year's Day]] in others.&lt;ref name="Victory For Human Kindness"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25206-2004Dec24.html "Remembering a Victory For Human Kindness – WWI's Puzzling, Poignant Christmas Truce"], David Brown, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 25 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Christmas Day, Brigadier-General [[Walter Norris Congreve|Walter Congreve]], then commanding [[18th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|18 Infantry Brigade]], stationed near [[Neuve Chapelle]], wrote a letter recalling the Germans initiated by calling a truce for the day. One of his brigade's men bravely lifted his head above the parapet and others from both sides walked onto no man's land. Officers and men shook hands and exchanged cigarettes and cigars, one of his captains "smoked a cigar with the best shot in the German army", the latter no more than 18 years old. Congreve admitted he was reluctant to personally witness the scene of the truce for fear he would be a prime target for German snipers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=General's letter from trenches|work=Shropshire Star|date=5 December 2014|page=12}}The letter describing the events had been published after discovery by Staffordshire County Council's archive service.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce Bairnsfather]], who served throughout the war, wrote:
{{quote|I wouldn't have missed that unique and weird Christmas Day for anything.... I spotted a German officer, some sort of lieutenant I should think, and being a bit of a collector, I intimated to him that I had taken a fancy to some of his buttons.... I brought out my wire clippers and, with a few deft snips, removed a couple of his buttons and put them in my pocket. I then gave him two of mine in exchange.... The last I saw was one of my machine gunners, who was a bit of an amateur hairdresser in civil life, cutting the unnaturally long hair of a docile Boche, who was patiently kneeling on the ground whilst the automatic clippers crept up the back of his neck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/11232 "Bullets &amp; Billets by Bruce Bairnsfather"], [[Project Gutenberg]], retrieved 31 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Regan, Geoffrey.

Future nature writer [[Henry Williamson]], then a nineteen-year-old private in the [[London Rifle Brigade]], wrote to his mother on Boxing Day: 
{{quote|Dear Mother, I am writing from the trenches. It is 11 o'clock in the morning. Beside me is a coke fire, opposite me a 'dug-out' (wet) with straw in it. The ground is sloppy in the actual trench, but frozen elsewhere. In my mouth is a pipe presented by the [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood#Royal duties|Princess Mary]]. In the pipe is tobacco. Of course, you say. But wait. In the pipe is German tobacco. Haha, you say, from a prisoner or found in a captured trench. Oh dear, no! From a German soldier. Yes a live German soldier from his own trench. Yesterday the British &amp; Germans met &amp; shook hands in the Ground between the trenches, &amp; exchanged souvenirs, &amp; shook hands. Yes, all day Xmas day, &amp; as I write. Marvellous, isn't it?&lt;ref name="Henry Williamson and the Christmas Truce"&gt;[http://www.henrywilliamson.co.uk/first-world-war/57-uncategorised/158-henry-williamson-and-the-christmas-truce Henry Williamson and the Christmas Truce], http://www.henrywilliamson.com&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Captain [[Edward Hulse, 7th Baronet|Sir Edward Hulse]] reported how the first interpreter he met from the German lines was from [[Suffolk]] where he had left his girlfriend and a 3.5&amp;nbsp;hp motorcycle. Hulse went on to describe a sing-song which "ended up with '[[Auld lang syne]]' which we all, English, Scots, Irish, Prussians, Württenbergers, etc, joined in. It was absolutely astounding, and if I had seen it on a cinematograph film I should have sworn that it was faked!"&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, pp. 140–142&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Robert Patrick Miles, [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]], who was attached to the [[Royal Irish Rifles]] recalled in an edited letter that was published in both the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and the ''Wellington Journal &amp; Shrewsbury News'' in January 1915, following his death in action on 30 December 1914: {{quote|Friday (Christmas Day). We are having the most extraordinary Christmas Day imaginable. A sort of unarranged and quite unauthorized but perfectly understood and scrupulously observed truce exists between us and our friends in front. The funny thing is it only seems to exist in this part of the battle line – on our right and left we can all hear them firing away as cheerfully as ever. The thing started last night – a bitter cold night, with white frost – soon after dusk when the Germans started shouting 'Merry Christmas, Englishmen' to us. Of course our fellows shouted back and presently large numbers of both sides had left their trenches, unarmed, and met in the debatable, shot-riddled, no man's land between the lines. Here the agreement – all on their own – came to be made that we should not fire at each other until after midnight tonight. The men were all fraternizing in the middle (we naturally did not allow them too close to our line) and swapped cigarettes and lies in the utmost good fellowship. Not a shot was fired all night.}}
Of the Germans he wrote: "They are distinctly bored with the war.... In fact, one of them wanted to know what on earth we were doing here fighting them." The truce in that sector continued into Boxing Day; he commented about the Germans, "The beggars simply disregard all our warnings to get down from off their parapet, so things are at a deadlock. We can't shoot them in cold blood.... I cannot see how we can get them to return to business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seasons over the decades, 1914|work=Shropshire Star|date=26 December 2014|page=18}}Article by Toby Neal. The ''Shropshire Star'' replaced the ''Wellington Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Christmas Eve and Christmas Day (24 and 25 December) 1914, [[Alfred Anderson (veteran)|Alfred Anderson’s]] unit of the 1st/5th Battalion of the [[Black Watch]] was billeted in a farmhouse away from the front line. In a later interview (2003), Anderson, the last known surviving Scottish veteran of the war, vividly recalled Christmas Day and said:
{{quote|I remember the silence, the eerie sound of silence. Only the guards were on duty. We all went outside the farm buildings and just stood listening. And, of course, thinking of people back home. All I’d heard for two months in the trenches was the hissing, cracking and whining of bullets in flight, machinegun fire and distant German voices. But there was a dead silence that morning, right across the land as far as you could see. We shouted ‘Merry Christmas’, even though nobody felt merry. The silence ended early in the afternoon and the killing started again. It was a short peace in a terrible war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftermathww1.com/oldestscot.asp Interview from 2003] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217052008/http://www.aftermathww1.com/oldestscot.asp |date=17 December 2005 }}, originally published in ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 25 June 2003, under the headline "Scotland's Oldest Man turns 107", by John Innes.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nor were the observations confined to the British. German Lieutenant Johannes Niemann wrote: "grabbed my binoculars and looking cautiously over the parapet saw the incredible sight of our soldiers exchanging cigarettes, schnapps and chocolate with the enemy."&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

General Sir [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]], commander of the [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|British II Corps]], issued orders forbidding friendly communication with the opposing German troops.&lt;ref name="The Truce of Christmas"/&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]], then a young corporal of the 16th Bavarian Reserve Infantry, was also an opponent of the truce.&lt;ref name="The Truce of Christmas"/&gt;
&lt;!--
add a section here on the resumption of hostilities--&gt;

In the Comines sector of the front there was an early fraternization between German and French soldiers in December 1914, during a short truce,&lt;ref&gt;''Catastrophe 1914: Europe Goes To War'', Max Hastings. William Collins 2013. ("On 24 December a Bavarian soldier named Carl Mühlegg walked nine miles to Comines, where he purchased a small pine tree before returning to his unit in the line. He then played Father Christmas, inviting his company commander to light the tree candles and wish peace to comrades, to the German people and the world. After midnight in Mühlegg’s sector, German and French soldiers met in no man’s land.")&lt;/ref&gt; and there are at least two other testimonials, from French soldiers, of similar behaviours in sectors where German and French companies opposed each other. Gervais Morillon wrote to his parents: ‘The Boches waved a white flag and shouted "Kamarades, Kamarades, rendez-vous." When we didn’t move they came towards us unarmed, led by an officer. Although we are not clean they are disgustingly filthy. I am telling you this but don’t speak of it to anyone. We must not mention it even to other soldiers.’ Gustave Berthier wrote: ‘On Christmas day the Boches made a sign showing they wished to speak to us. They said they didn’t want to shoot.... They were tired of making war, they were married like me, they didn’t have any differences with the French but with the English.’&lt;ref&gt;''Catastrophe 1914: Europe Goes To War'', Max Hastings. William Collins 2013. ("Twenty-year-old Gervais Morillon wrote to his parents: ‘The Boches waved a white flag and shouted “Kamarades, Kamarades, rendez-vous.” When we didn’t move they came towards us unarmed, led by an officer. Although we are not clean they are disgustingly filthy. I am telling you this but don’t speak of it to anyone. We must not mention it even to other soldiers.’ Morillon was killed in 1915.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Catastrophe 1914: Europe Goes To War'', Max Hastings. William Collins 2013. ("Elsewhere twenty-five-year-old Gustave Berthier wrote: ‘On Christmas day the Boches made a sign showing they wished to speak to us. They said they didn’t want to shoot.... They were tired of making war, they were married like me, they didn’t have any differences with the French but with the English.’ Berthier perished in June 1917.")&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Yser Front|sections of the front]] where German and Belgian troops faced each other in December 1914, there was at least one such instance when a truce was achieved at the request of Belgian soldiers who wished to send letters back to their families, over the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|German-occupied parts]] of their own country.&lt;ref&gt;''Catastrophe 1914: Europe Goes To War'', Max Hastings. William Collins 2013. ("Belgians likewise clambered out of their positions near Dixmude and spoke across the Yser canal to Germans whom they persuaded to post cards to their families in occupied territory. Some German officers appeared, and asked to see a Belgian field chaplain. The invaders then offered him a communion vessel found by their men during the battle for Dixmude, which was placed in a burlap bag attached to a rope tossed across the waterway. The Belgians pulled it to their own bank with suitable expressions of gratitude.")&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Schirrmann]], who was in a German regiment holding a position on the Bernhardstein, one of the mountains of the [[Vosges Mountains|Vosges]], wrote an account of events in December 1915: "When the Christmas bells sounded in the villages of the Vosges behind the lines... something fantastically unmilitary occurred. German and French troops spontaneously made peace and ceased hostilities; they visited each other through disused trench tunnels, and exchanged wine, cognac and cigarettes for [[Pumpernickel|Westphalian black bread]], biscuits and ham. This suited them so well that they remained good friends even after Christmas was over." He was separated from the French troops by a narrow No Man's Land and described the landscape as: "Strewn with shattered trees, the ground ploughed up by shellfire, a wilderness of earth, tree-roots and tattered uniforms." Military discipline was soon restored, but Schirrmann pondered over the incident, and whether "thoughtful young people of all countries could be provided with suitable meeting places where they could get to know each other." He went on to found the [[German Youth Hostel Association]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Schirrmann: The first youth hosteller: A biographical sketch by Graham Heath (1962, International Youth Hostel Association, Copenhagen, in English).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Football matches===
Many accounts of the truce involve one or more [[association football|football]] matches played in no-man's land. This was mentioned in some of the earliest reports, with a letter written by a doctor attached to the [[Rifle Brigade]], published in ''The Times'' on 1 January 1915, reported "a football match... played between them and us in front of the trench".&lt;ref name="Dashblog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Peace on the Western Front, Goodwill in No Man’s Land — The Story of the World War I Christmas Truce|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-story-of-the-wwi-christmas-truce-11972213/|publisher=Smithsonian.com|author=[[Mike Dash]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of similar stories have been told over the years, often naming specific units or a precise score. Some accounts of the game bring in elements of fiction by [[Robert Graves]], a British poet and writer (and an officer on the front at the time) &lt;ref&gt;Robert Graves, Goodbye to All That, 1929&lt;/ref&gt;who reconstructed the encounter in a story published in 1962; in Graves's version, the score was 3–2 to the Germans.&lt;ref name="Dashblog"/&gt;

However, the truth of the accounts has been disputed by some historians; in 1984, Malcolm Brown and Shirley Seaton concluded that there were probably attempts to play organised matches which failed due to the state of the ground, but that the contemporary reports were either hearsay or refer to "kick-about" matches with "made-up footballs" such as a bully-beef tin.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Seaton, ''Christmas Truce'' (1984); pp. 136–139&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Baker, former chairman of [[The Western Front Association]] and author of ''The Truce: The Day the War Stopped''&lt;ref&gt;Baker, C, ''The Truce: The Day the War Stopped'', Amberley, 2014, {{ISBN|978-1445634906}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also sceptical, but says that although there is little hard evidence, the most likely place that an organised match could have taken place was near the village of Messines: "There are two references to a game being played on the British side, but nothing from the Germans.

===Eastern Front===
A separate manifestation of the Christmas truce in December 1914 occurred on the Eastern front, where the first move originated from the Austro-Hungarian commanders, at some uncertain level of the military hierarchy. The Russians responded positively and soldiers eventually met in no man’s land.&lt;ref&gt;''Catastrophe 1914: Europe Goes To War'', Max Hastings. William Collins 2013. ("On Christmas Day in Galicia, Austrian troops were ordered not to fire unless provoked, and the Russians displayed the same restraint. Some of the besiegers of Przemyśl deposited three Christmas trees in no man’s land with a polite accompanying note addressed to the enemy: ‘We wish you, the heroes of Przemyśl, a Merry Christmas and hope that we can come to a peaceful agreement as soon as possible.’ In no man’s land, soldiers met and exchanged Austrian tobacco and schnapps for Russian bread and meat. When the Tsar’s soldiers held their own seasonal festivities a few days later, Habsburg troops reciprocated.")&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public awareness==
The events of the truce were not reported for a week, in an unofficial press embargo which was eventually broken by ''[[The New York Times]]'', published in the then-neutral United States, on 31 December. The British papers quickly followed, printing numerous first-hand accounts from soldiers in the field, taken from letters home to their families, and editorials on "one of the greatest surprises of a surprising war". By 8 January pictures had made their way to the press, and both the [[Daily Mirror|''Mirror'']] and [[Daily Sketch|''Sketch'']] printed front-page photographs of British and German troops mingling and singing between the lines. The tone of the reporting was strongly positive, with the [[The Times|''Times'']] endorsing the "lack of malice" felt by both sides and the ''Mirror'' regretting that the "absurdity and the tragedy" would begin again.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub (2001), pp. 179–80. The "greatest surprises" quote is from the ''South Wales Gazette'' on 1 January 1915.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coverage in Germany was more muted, with some newspapers strongly criticising those who had taken part, and no pictures published. In France, meanwhile, the greater level of [[press censorship]] ensured that the only word that spread of the truce came from soldiers at the front or first-hand accounts told by wounded men in hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub (2001), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; The press was eventually forced to respond to the growing rumours by reprinting a government notice that fraternising with the enemy constituted treason, and in early January an official statement on the truce was published, claiming it had happened on restricted sectors of the ''British'' front, and amounted to little more than an exchange of songs which quickly degenerated into shooting.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub (2001), pp. 73–75&lt;/ref&gt;

The press of then-neutral Italy published a few articles on the events of the truce, usually reporting the articles of the foreign press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cutolo|first=Francesco|date=2015|title=La tregua di Natale 1914: echi e riflessi in Italia|url=http://istitutostoricoresistenza.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/QF-2015-n.-3.pdf|journal=QF. Quaderni di Farestoria|volume=3|pages=19-26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December 1914, ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' printed a report about a fraternization between the opposing trenches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title="Echi e riflessi della guerra a Berlino. Cortesie tra nemici"|last=|first=|date=30 December 1914|work=Corriere della Sera|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Florentine newspaper ''[[La Nazione]]'' published a first-hand account about a football match played in the [[no man's land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title="Football tra nemici"|last=|first=|date=3 January 1915|work=La Nazione|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, the lack of interest in the truce probably depended on the occurrence of other events, such as the [[Albania during World War I#Serbian retreat and Austrian occupation (winter 1915)|Italian occupation of Vlorë]], the debut of the [[Garibaldi Legion (French Foreign Legion)|Garibaldi Legion]] on the front of the Argonne and, finally, the [[1915 Avezzano earthquake|earthquake in Avezzano]].

==Later truces==
[[File:The Christmas Truce on the Western Front, 1914 Q50720.jpg|thumb|right|British and German troops burying the bodies of those killed in the attack of 18 December.]]
After Christmas 1914, sporadic attempts were made at seasonal truces; a German unit attempted to leave their trenches under a flag of truce on [[Easter Sunday]] 1915, but were warned off by the British opposite them, and later in the year, in November, a [[Saxony|Saxon]] unit briefly fraternised with a [[Liverpool]] battalion. In December 1915, there were explicit orders by the Allied commanders to forestall any repeat of the previous Christmas truce. Individual units were encouraged to mount raids and harass the enemy line, whilst communicating with the enemy was discouraged by [[artillery barrage]]s along the front line throughout the day. The prohibition was not completely effective, however, and a small number of brief truces occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub (2001), pp. 194–195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riley (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

An eyewitness account of one truce, by [[Llewelyn Wyn Griffith]], recorded that after a night of exchanging carols, dawn on Christmas Day saw a "rush of men from both sides... [and] a feverish exchange of souvenirs" before the men were quickly called back by their officers, with offers to hold a ceasefire for the day and to play a football match. It came to nothing, as the brigade commander threatened repercussions for the lack of discipline, and insisted on a resumption of firing in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (2005) pp. 75–76. The unit in question was the 15th [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]], a battalion of the volunteer [[Kitchener's Army|New Armies]], which were just arriving in France for the first time in late 1915 and early 1916. Griffith mentions Christmas Day was "the first time [he] had seen no-man's land"; his men were, quite possibly, also on their first tour in the front lines this day.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, another member of Griffith's battalion, [[Bertie Felstead]], later recalled that one man had produced a football, resulting in "a free-for-all; there could have been 50 on each side", before they were ordered back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/obituary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=718781 |title=Bertie Felstead The last known survivor of no-man's-land football died on July 22, 2001 aged 106 |publisher=[[The Economist]] |date=2 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riley (2017), p. 717&lt;/ref&gt; Another unnamed participant reported in a letter home: "The Germans seem to be very nice chaps, and said they were awfully sick of the war."&lt;ref&gt;Riley (2017), p. 722; quoting letter published in ''Wrexham Advertiser'', 9 January 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; In the evening, according to Robert Keating, another eyewitness, "The Germans were sending up star lights and singing – they stopped, so we cheered them &amp; we began singing [[Land of Hope and Glory]] – [[Men of Harlech]] et cetera – we stopped and they cheered us. So we went on till the early hours of the morning."&lt;ref&gt;Riley (2017), p. 720&lt;/ref&gt;

In an adjacent sector, a short truce to bury the dead between the lines led to official repercussions; a company commander, Sir [[Sir Iain Colquhoun, 7th Baronet|Iain Colquhoun]] of the [[Scots Guards]], was [[court-martial]]led for defying standing orders to the contrary. While he was found guilty and reprimanded, the punishment was annulled by General [[Douglas Haig|Haig]] and Colquhoun remained in his position; the official leniency may perhaps have been because his wife's uncle was [[H. H. Asquith]], the Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Macdonald|first1=Alastair|title=How Christmas Truce led to court martial|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ww1-century-truce/how-christmas-truce-led-to-court-martial-idUSKBN0K20K320141224|accessdate=27 December 2017|agency=Reuters|date=2014-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub (2001), pp. 194–195; Brown (2005) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Decembers of 1916 and 1917, German overtures to the British for truces were recorded without any success.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub (2001), p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; In some French sectors, singing and an exchange of thrown gifts was occasionally recorded, though these may simply have reflected a seasonal extension of the live-and-let-live approach common in the trenches.&lt;ref&gt;Cazals (2005), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

At Easter 1915 there were recorded instances of truces between Orthodox troops of opposing sides on the Eastern front. The Bulgarian writer [[Yordan Yovkov]], serving as an officer near the Greek border at the [[Mesta river]], witnessed one such truce. It inspired his short story "Holy Night", translated into English in 2013 by Krastu Banaev.&lt;ref&gt;Banaev, Krastu (translator). "Holy Night by Yordan Yovkov ". Sobornost 34, no. 1 (2013): 41–51.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and historical significance==
[[File:Christmas Truce memorial ceremony 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|British and German descendants of Great War veterans]]
Although the popular tendency has been to see the December 1914 Christmas Truces as unique and therefore of romantic rather than political significance, they have also been interpreted as part of the widespread non-co-operation with the war spirit and conduct by serving soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://research.ncl.ac.uk/martinlutherking/activities/worldwaronechristmastrucecommemorations/ Teaching the 1914 Christmas Truces] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018090629/http://research.ncl.ac.uk/martinlutherking/activities/worldwaronechristmastrucecommemorations/ |date=18 October 2014 }}', Northumbria and Newcastle Universities Martin Luther King Peace Committee, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In his book on trench warfare, historian Tony Ashworth describes what he calls the 'live and let live system'. Complicated local truces and agreements not to fire at each other were developed by men along the front throughout the war. These often began with agreement not to attack each other at tea, meal or washing times, and in some places became so developed that whole sections of the front would see few casualties for extended periods of time. This system, Ashworth argues, 'gave soldiers some control over the conditions of their existence.'&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, Tony. 1980. Trench Warfare 1914–1918: The Live and Let Live System, Pan Grand Strategy. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; The December 1914 Christmas Truces then can be seen as not unique, but as the most dramatic example of non-co-operation with the war spirit that included refusal to fight, unofficial truces, mutinies, strikes, and peace protests.

These included lesson plans, hand-outs, worksheets, PowerPoint slide shows, and full plans for assemblies, and carol services/Christmas productions. The authors explained that their purpose was both to enable schoolteachers to help children learn about the remarkable events of December 1914, but also to use the theme of Christmas to provide a counterpoint to the UK government's glorification of the First World War as heroic. As the Peace Committee argues, "These spontaneous acts of festive goodwill directly contradicted orders from high command, and offered an evocative and hopeful – albeit brief – recognition of shared humanity"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.ncl.ac.uk/martinlutherking/activities/worldwaronechristmastrucecommemorations/|title=World War One Christmas Truce Commemorations; Martin Luther King Peace Committee; Newcastle University|publisher=|access-date=17 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018090629/http://research.ncl.ac.uk/martinlutherking/activities/worldwaronechristmastrucecommemorations/|archive-date=18 October 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and thereby, they argue, give a rereading of the traditional Christmas message of "on earth peace, good will toward men."&lt;ref&gt;Bible, King James Version, Luke 2:14.&lt;/ref&gt;

This slight bending of the rules results in the captain being returned to history at the beginning of the Christmas truce, allowing the captain to live and request aid for his would-be killer, the Twelfth Doctor musing that such a truce was the only time such a thing happened in history but it never hurts to ensure that there will be a couple of fewer dead people on a battlefield.

'''Edwin Anderson Walker''' (November 10, 1909 – October 31, 1993) — known as '''Ted Walker''' — was a [[United States Army]] officer who served in [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]]. He became known for his staunch [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political opinions and was criticized by [[U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] for promoting a personal political opinion while in uniform. Walker resigned his commission during 1959, but Eisenhower refused to accept his resignation and gave Walker a new command of the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]] in Augsburg, Germany. Walker again resigned his commission during 1961 after being publicly and formally admonished by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] for allegedly referring to [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and [[Harry S. Truman]] as "pink" in print (a charge made by a leftist newspaper named the ''[[Overseas Weekly]]'' and never substantiated)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Case of General Edwin A. Walker|last=Courtney|first=Kent and Phoebe|publisher=Conservative Society of America|year=1961|isbn=|location=New Orleans, LA|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for violating the [[Hatch Act of 1939]] by attempting to influence the votes of his troops. President [[John F. Kennedy]] accepted his resignation, making Walker the USA's only general to resign during the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

During early 1962, Walker campaigned for [[governor of Texas]] and lost the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[primary election]] to the eventual winner, [[John Connally]]. During October 1962, Walker was arrested for promoting [[Ole Miss riot of 1962|riots]] at the [[University of Mississippi]] in protest against admitting a black student, [[James Meredith]], into the all-white university. Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] ordered Walker committed to a mental asylum for a 90-day evaluation in response to his role in the Ole Miss riot of 1962, but psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]] protested and Walker was released in five days. Attorney [[Robert J. Morris|Robert Morris]] convinced a Mississippi [[grand jury]] not to indict Walker.

Walker was the target of an assassination attempt in his home on April 10, 1963, but escaped serious injury by the attack when a bullet fired from outside hit a window frame and fragmented. After its investigation into the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], the [[Warren Commission]] concluded that Walker's assailant had been [[Lee Harvey Oswald]].&lt;ref name="WCR-C4"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/ |year=1964 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=183–187 |chapter=Chapter 4: The Assassin |chapterurl=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-4.html |ref={{harvid|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 4|1964}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and military career==
Walker was born in [[Texas]] in [[Kerr County]] in the community of [[Center Point, Kerr County, Texas|Center Point]], in the [[Texas Hill Country]]. He graduated during 1927 from the [[New Mexico Military Institute]]. He attended the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]], where he graduated in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Texas: [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hlc17 "Center Point, Texas."] Retrieved March 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker's experience was as an artilleryman, but during [[World War II]], he commanded a sub-unit of the Canadian-American [[First Special Service Force]]. Walker began command of one of the force's three regiments while still in the United States, and commanded the 3rd Regiment throughout its time in Italy. Their first combat actions began during December 1943, and after battling through the Winter Line, the Force was withdrawn for redeployment to the Anzio beachhead during early 1944. After the fight for Rome during June 1944, the force was withdrawn again to prepare for [[Operation Dragoon]]. During August 1944, Walker succeeded [[Robert T. Frederick]] as the unit's second, and last, commanding officer.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, Ken'' Snow Plough and the Jupiter Deception: The Story of the 1st Special Service Force and the 1st Canadian Special Service Battalion, 1942-1945'' (Vanwell Publishing Ltd., St. Catharines, ON, 2006) {{ISBN|1-55125-094-2}}, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The FSSF landed on the [[Îles d'Hyères|Islands of Hyeres]] off of the [[French Riviera]] during the autumn of 1944, defeating a strong German garrison. Walker commanded the FSSF when it was disbanded during early 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce (2006), ''Snow Plough and the Jupiter Deception'', p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker experienced combat during the [[Korean War]], commanding the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|Third Infantry Division]]'s [[7th Infantry Regiment (United States)|7th Infantry Regiment]] and serving as a senior advisor to the Army of the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]].

Next Walker was assigned as commander of the Arkansas Military District in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], [[Arkansas]]. During his years in Arkansas, he [[Little Rock Nine#Armed escort|implemented an order]] from President Eisenhower during 1957 to quell civil disturbances during the desegregation of Little Rock's [[Central High School (Little Rock)|Central High School]]. [[Osro Cobb]], the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas|US Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas]], recalls that Walker 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"made it clear from the outset ... that he would do any and everything necessary to see that the black students attended Central High School as ordered by the federal court... he would arrange protection for them and their families, if necessary, and also supervise their transportation to and from the school for their safety."&lt;ref&gt;[[Osro Cobb]], "Osro Cobb of Arkansas: Memories of Historical Significance," Carol Griffee, ed. ([[Little Rock, Arkansas]]: Rose Publishing Company, 1989), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During that time, Walker repeatedly protested to President Eisenhower that using Federal troops to enforce racial integration was against his conscience. Although he obeyed orders and successfully integrated Little Rock High School, he began listening to  segregationist preacher [[Billy James Hargis]] and oil tycoon [[H. L. Hunt]], whose anti-communist radio program ''Life Line'' was funded by conservative activist and publisher [[Dan Smoot]]. Anti-Communist activists (during 1957-1959) claimed that Communists controlled important parts of the U.S. government and the United Nations;{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} some Soviet spies and agents occupied prominent jobs within the U.S. Federal government, e.g. some of the [[Silvermaster group]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

During 1959, Walker met publisher [[Robert W. Welch, Jr.|Robert Welch]]. The latter man had just initiated the [[John Birch Society]] to promote his anti-communist opinions, one of which was that President Eisenhower was a communist.  This assertion surprised General Walker because it coincided with the segregationist argument of Reverend [[Billy James Hargis]] that the [[Civil Rights Movement]] was a communist plot.

On August 4, 1959, Walker submitted his resignation to the U.S. Army. President Eisenhower denied Walker's request for resignation and offered him command over more than 10,000 troops in [[Augsburg, Germany]], specifically the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]]. Walker accepted that command. He began promoting his "Pro-Blue" indoctrination program for troops, which included a reading list of materials from Billy James Hargis and the John Birch Society.

The name "Pro-Blue," said Walker, was intended to suggest "anti-Red."&lt;ref&gt;p. 105 Schoenwald, Jonathan M. ''A Time for Choosing: The Rise of American Conservatism,'' Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote that the Pro-Blue program was based upon his experiences in Korea, where he saw "hastily mobilized and deployed soldiers 'bug out' in the face of Communist units with inferior equipment and often smaller numbers. American soldiers, unprepared for the psychological battlefield, needed to know why they had to beat the enemy as well as the how."&lt;ref&gt;Major General Edwin A. Walker, ''Censorship and Survival'' (New York, The Bookmailer Inc. 1961) pp. 14, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoting the Pro-Blue program brought General Walker into conflict with the ''[[Overseas Weekly]]'', a tabloid newspaper.&lt;ref name="dallas-1963"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dallas 1963 |last1=Minutaglio |first1=Bill |last2=Davis |first2=Steven L. |year=2013 |publisher=Twelve |isbn=978-1-4555-2209-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 16, 1961, the ''Weekly'' published an article accusing Walker of indoctrinating his troops with John Birch Society materials.&lt;ref name="The Index-Journal; May 16, 1961"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sokolsky |first=George E. |authorlink=George Sokolsky |date=May 16, 1961 |title=Taking Close Look At Overseas Weekly |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/70084043/ |work=The Index-Journal |location=Greenwood, South Carolina |access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the John Birch Society regularly claimed that all U.S. presidents from [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] onward had been communists, its opinions were considered too controversial politically for a U.S. general to advocate; military officers were not supposed to engage in politics at all. Walker was quoted by the ''Overseas Weekly'' as saying that [[Harry S. Truman]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], and Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] were "definitely [[pinko|pink]]." Additionally, a number of soldiers had complained that Walker was instructing them how to vote in the forthcoming American election by using the ''Conservative Voting Index'', which was biased toward the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name="Lemza"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lemza |first=John W. |date=2016 |title=American Military Communities in West Germany: Life in the Cold War Badlands, 1945-1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOPIDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |chapter=One. From First Arrivals to Established Network (1946-1967) |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOPIDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. |pages=18–19 |isbn=9781476664163}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Walker, his alleged instruction to soldiers as how to vote would later be disproved. The allegation was based on an article in the division newspaper that provided information as to how to fill out [[absentee ballot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Major General Edwin A. Walker, ''Censorship and Survival'' (New York, The Bookmailer Inc. 1961), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after the ''Overseas Weekly'' story was published, Walker was relieved of his command by Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]], while an inquiry was conducted. During October, Walker was reassigned to [[Hawaii]] to become assistant chief of staff for training and operations in the Pacific region.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Walker chose to resign from the Army a second time. Because the investigation had not found any evidence of wrongdoing by Walker, the Secretary of the Army chose to admonish the officer, which could not be appealed by the general. The Secretary also stated that Walker would not be permitted to command VIII Corps, as the President had withdrawn his name for promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Major General Edwin A. Walker, ''Censorship and Survival'' (New York, The Bookmailer Inc. 1961), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In protest, Walker, preferring political activism to his 30-year military career, did not retire but resigned, thereby forfeiting his pension. This time, President Kennedy accepted his resignation.  
 
Walker said: "It will be my purpose now, as a civilian, to attempt to do what I have found it no longer possible to do in uniform."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,938238,00.html I Must Be Free . . .]," ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', November 10, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
During December 1961, as a civilian, Walker began a career of political speeches along with Hargis. Walker enjoyed enthusiastic crowds all over the United States. His message of anti-communism was popular. He also promoted the [[McCarthyist]] belief that communists were ''inside'' the United States government. Walker's home base was [[Dallas, Texas]], considered a conservative city {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}.  Walker received considerable assistance from the citizens of Dallas, in particular from oil billionaire, publisher and radio host [[H. L. Hunt]], who assisted Walker's first election campaign for [[governor of Texas]]. A [[Newsweek]] cover proclaimed General Walker the public face of the anti-communist conservative movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ciadidnotkilljfk.com/  Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker "Thunder on the Right" ''Newsweek'' cover December 4, 1961].&lt;/ref&gt;

During February 1962, Walker began the campaign, but finished last among six candidates in a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[primary election]]. It was won in a [[runoff election]] by [[John B. Connally, Jr.]], the choice of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Other contenders were the Governor [[Price Daniel]], Highway Commissioner [[Marshall Formby]] of [[Plainview, Texas|Plainview]], [[Attorney General of Texas]] [[Will Wilson]], and [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] lawyer [[Don Yarborough]], the favorite of [[liberal (politics)|liberals]] and [[organized labor]]. Due to [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement of minorities]] in Texas since the beginning of the century, the Democratic Party primaries were the only strongly competitive political contests in the state at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://texasalmanac.com/sites/default/files/images/uploads/gov1845-2010table.pdf Elections of Texas Governors, 1845–2010].&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of his campaign, Walker assaulted journalist Thomas V. Kelly (father of [[New York Times]] editor [[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]]), who asked him for a response to praise of Walker made by American Nazi Party leader George Lincoln Rockwell; Walker's response was to strike Kelly in the left eye. This assault was widely reported in press headlines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/19/AR2010061902924.html??noredirect=on&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://outlet.historicimages.com/products/rsb47865&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Walker had obeyed orders in achieving desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock, he acted privately in organizing protests during September 1962 against the enrollment of [[James Meredith]], an African-American veteran, at the all-caucasian [[University of Mississippi]] at [[Oxford, Mississippi]].

On September 26, 1962, Walker broadcast this message by several radio stations:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mississippi: It is time to move. We have talked, listened and been pushed around far too much by the [[anti-Christ]] Supreme Court!  Rise...to a stand beside Governor [[Ross Barnett]] at Jackson, Mississippi! Now is the time to be heard!  Thousands strong from every State in the Union!  Rally to the cause of freedom! The Battle Cry of the Republic!  Barnett yes! Castro no! Bring your flag, your tent and your skillet. It's now or never! The time is when the President of the United States commits or uses any troops, Federal or State, in Mississippi! The last time in such a situation I was on the wrong side. That was in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1957-1958. This time -- out of uniform -- I am on the right side! I will be there! &lt;ref&gt;''Edwin A. Walker and the Right Wing in Dallas,'' Chris Cravens, 1993, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On September 29, 1962, he issued a televised statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is Edwin A. Walker. I am in Mississippi beside Governor Ross Barnett. I call for a national protest against the conspiracy from within. Rally to the cause of freedom in righteous indignation, violent vocal protest, and bitter silence under the flag of Mississippi at the use of [[Mississippi Army National Guard|Federal troops]]. This today is a disgrace to the nation in 'dire peril,' a disgrace beyond the capacity of anyone except its enemies. This is the conspiracy of the crucifixion by anti-Christ conspirators of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in their [[Engel v. Vitale|denial of prayer]] and their betrayal of a nation.&lt;ref&gt;"Walker Demands a 'Vocal Protest,'" ''The New York Times'', September 30, 1962, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

White segregationists from around the state joined students and locals in a violent, 15-hour [[Ole Miss riot of 1962|riot on the campus]] on September 30, in which two people were killed execution style, hundreds were wounded, and six [[United States Marshals Service|federal marshals]] were shot. Walker was arrested for four federal charges, including [[Sedition#United States|sedition]] and [[insurrection]] against the United States. He was temporarily detained in a mental institution on orders from Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Kennedy demanded that Walker receive a 90-day psychiatric examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fee.org/articles/the-shame-of-medicine-the-case-of-general-edwin-walker/ |title=The Shame of Medicine: The Case of General Edwin Walker |last=Szasz |first=Thomas |author-link=Thomas Szasz |date=September 23, 2009 |website=Foundation for Economic Education |publisher=Foundation for Economic Education |access-date=May 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attorney general's decision was challenged by noted psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]], who insisted that psychiatry must never become used for political rivalry.  The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] joined Szasz in a protest against the attorney general, completing this coalition of liberal and conservative leaders. The attorney general had to relent, and Walker spent only five days in the asylum.&lt;ref&gt;''Edwin A. Walker and the Right Wing in Dallas,'' Chris Cravens, 1993, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker posted bond and returned home to Dallas, where he was greeted by a crowd of some two hundred devotees.&lt;ref&gt;"Crowd Welcomes Ex-Gen. Walker's Return to Dallas," ''Dallas Morning News'', October 8, 1962, sec. 1, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; After a federal [[grand jury]] adjourned during January 1963 without indicting him, the charges were dismissed. Because the dismissal of the charges was without prejudice, the charges could have been reinstated within five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://textfiles.com/conspiracy/walker.txt The Strange Case of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination attempt==
During February 1963, Walker joined [[Billy James Hargis|Billy Hargis]] in an anti-communist tour named "Operation [[Paul Revere's Ride (poem)|Midnight Ride]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Hargis Says Walker Will Join in Tour," ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', February 14, 1963, sec. 1, p. 16. "Walker Preparing for Crusade," ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', February 17, 1963, sec. 1, p. 16. "Pickets Protest Talks Given by Hargis, Walker," ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', March 28, 1963, sec. 4, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech Walker made on March 5, reported in the ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]'', he called on the United States military to "liquidate the [communist] scourge that has descended upon the island of Cuba."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dallas Times Herald]]'', March 6, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Seven days later, [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] ordered by mail a [[John F. Kennedy assassination rifle|Carcano rifle]], using the alias "A. Hidell."&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 17, p. 635, CE 773, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh17/html/WH_Vol17_0331a.htm Photograph of a mail order for a rifle in the name "A. Hidell," and the envelope in which the order was sent].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Warren Commission]], Oswald began to put Walker under [[surveillance]], photographing the general's Dallas home on the weekend of March 9–10.&lt;ref&gt;Construction work seen in one of the photos was determined by the supervisor to have been in that state of completion on March 9–10. Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 22, p. 585, CE 1351, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh22/html/WH_Vol22_0308a.htm FBI Report, Dallas, Tex., dated May 22, 1964, reflecting investigation concerning photographs of the residence of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010055206/http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh22/html/WH_Vol22_0308a.htm |date=October 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oswald's friend, 51-year-old Russian émigré and petroleum geologist [[George de Mohrenschildt]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol12/pdf/HSCA_Vol12_deMohren.pdf George de Mohrenschildt]. Staff Report of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, vol. 12, 4, p. 53–54, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; would later tell the Warren Commission that he "knew that Oswald disliked General Walker".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0129a.htm Testimony of George de Mohrenschildt], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 9, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 1963, as Walker was sitting at a desk in his dining room, a bullet struck the wooden frame of his dining room window. Walker was injured in the forearm by fragments. [[Marina Oswald]] later testified that her husband told her that he traveled by bus to General Walker's house and shot at Walker with his rifle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh1/html/WC_Vol1_0015a.htm Testimony of Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald], Warren Commission Hearings, volume 1, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Before the Kennedy assassination, the Dallas police did not have any suspects for the Walker shooting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/report/pdf/HSCA_Report_1A_LHO.pdf |title=HSCA Final Report: I.

Guinn], HSCA Hearings, vol. I, p. 502.&lt;/ref&gt;

Police Detective D. E. McElroy commented, "Whoever shot at the general was playing for keeps. The sniper wasn't trying to scare him. He was shooting to kill." Marina Oswald stated later that she had seen Oswald burn most of his plans in the bathtub, though she hid the note he left her in a cookbook, with the intention of bringing it to the police should Oswald again attempt to kill Walker or anyone else. Marina later quoted her husband as saying, "Well, what would you say if somebody got rid of Hitler at the right time? So if you don't know about General Walker, how can you speak up on his behalf?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol2/html/HSCA_Vol2_0118b.htm Testimony of Marina Oswald Porter], HSCA Hearings, vol. II, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oswald later wrote to Arnold Johnson of the [[Communist Party USA]] that on the evening of October 23, 1963, he had attended an "ultra right" meeting directed by Walker.&lt;ref&gt;''Warren Commission Hearings,'' vol. 20, p. 271, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh20/html/WH_Vol20_0146a.htm Undated letter from Lee Harvey Oswald to Arnold S. Johnson, with envelope postmarked November 1, 1963]. "Rally Talk Scheduled by Walker," ''Dallas Morning News'', October 23, 1963, sec. 1, p. 7. "Walker Says U.S. Main Battleground," ''Dallas Morning News'', October 24, 1963, sec. 4, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 29, 1963, one week following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, an article appeared in a German newspaper,''[[National Zeitung|Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung]]'' that accused reputed JFK assassin, [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], of having committed the attack on Walker. Oswald's widow, [[Marina Oswald]] was asked about the report during a two-week-long detention for interrogation by federal investigators, and she said she believed the report was true. There is some question among skeptics of the [[Warren Commission]]'s investigation into the JFK assassination, about how a European newspaper with no significant presence in the United States was able to receive information about a rather obscure crime that occurred on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. By the time the connection between Oswald and Walker came to light, however, Lee Harvey Oswald had died while in police custody, so no charges were ever filed for the crime.

Walker organized a verbal attack in Dallas, Texas, on [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]], US Ambassador to the [[United Nations]], on "UN Day," October 24, 1963. During mid-October 1963, Walker rented the same Dallas Memorial Auditorium in which Stevenson would speak.  He advertised his opposing event as "US Day" and he invited members of the John Birch Society, the [[National Indignation Convention]], the [[Minutemen (anti-Communist organization)|Minutemen]] and other organizations opposed to communism and the [[United Nations]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

On the night before Stevenson's speech, Walker had his "US Day" rally and instructed his audience to "buy all the tickets" they could afford to the Stevenson speech, and to fill the auditorium.  Walker instructed his audience to heckle Stevenson, bring Halloween noisemakers, and recite their own speeches in the hallways in order to disrupt Stevenson's speech in any way that they could.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Walker also told his devotees to fix a banner to the ceiling, to be unfurled at the appropriate moment. It was to be printed with "US out of UN!," and on the other side, "UN out of US!"  Walker did not attend Stevenson's speech, nor did he take credit for the orchestration.  The audience was so disruptive that Stevenson quit speaking before finishing his presentation and went quickly out to his limousine.  On his way, a protester spat at him and one struck him in the head with her placard. Both were arrested. Walker was not charged, although his role was well known at the time.&lt;ref&gt;''Edwin Walker and the Right Wing in Dallas, 1960-1966'', by Chris Cravens, chapter 6 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

The verbal attacks on United Nations Ambassador [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] on October 24, 1963 were traced to plans organized by Edwin Walker and his devotees among the [[John Birch Society]], according to the November issue of the magazine ''[[The Texas Observer|Texas Observer]]''. One month later, the black-bordered advertisement and the "Wanted for Treason: JFK" handbills of November 22, 1963, appeared on the streets of Dallas. They were traced to Edwin Walker and his associate [[Robert Surrey]] by the Warren Commission. After [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy's assassination]], Walker wrote and spoke publicly about his belief that there were two assassins at the "April Crime" - Oswald and another person that was never found.

Immediately after the [[Warren Commission]] released their report during September 1964, Walker described it as a "farcical whitewash".&lt;ref name="The Courier-Journal; March 31, 1964"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Probe Is Whitewash: Walker |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/109123561/ |work=The Courier-Journal |location=Louisville, Kentucky |date=March 31, 1964 |page=3 |access-date=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he accepted their finding that it was Oswald who shot at him the previous year, Walker claimed that the Commission was attempting to hide "some sort of conspiracy" that included an association between [[Jack Ruby]] and Oswald.&lt;ref name="The Chicago Tribune; September 28, 1964"&gt;{{cite news |date=September 28, 1964 |title=Warren Probe Whitewashes Plot: Walker |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/09/28/page/2/article/warren-probe-whitewashes-plot-walker |work=Chicago Tribune |volume=118 |issue=272 |edition=Final |agency=UPI |at=Section 1, page 2 |access-date=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Associated Press v. Walker''==
Angered by negative publicity, Walker began to file libel lawsuits against various media outlets. One suit responded to negative coverage of his role in the riot at the University of Mississippi protesting Meredith's admission. The [[Associated Press]] reported that Walker had "led a charge of students against federal marshals" and that he had "assumed command of the crowd."&lt;ref&gt;''Associated Press v. Walker'', 393 S.W.2d 671, 674 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; Several newspapers were named in the lawsuit. If Walker and his lawyers were successful, he could have won tens of millions of dollars.

A Texas trial court during 1964 found the statements false and defamatory.
&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898176,00.html The General v. The Cub]", ''Time'', June 26, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; 
By that time, Walker and his lawyers had already won more than [[United States dollar|$]]3 million in lawsuits.

The Associated Press appealed the decision, as ''Associated Press v. Walker'', eventually to the [[United States Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;''Associated Press v. Walker'', 389 U.S. 28 (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; During 1967, the Supreme Court ruled against Walker, finding that, although the statements may have been false, the Associated Press was not guilty of reckless disregard in their reporting about Walker. The Court, which had previously said that public ''officials'' could not recover damages unless they could prove malice, extended this to public ''figures'' as well.

==Later life==
By resigning instead of retiring, Walker was ineligible for an army pension. He made statements at the time to the ''Dallas Morning News'' that he had "refused" his pension. However, he had made several previous requests for his pension dating back to 1973. The army restored his pension rights during 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Weaver, Jr., "Pension Restored for Gen. Walker", ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 24, 1983, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker, then 66, was arrested on June 23, 1976, for public lewdness in a restroom at a Dallas park. He was accused of fondling and propositioning a male undercover police officer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/09/archives/general-walker-faces-sex-charge-rightwing-figure-accused-in-dallas.html "General Walker Faces Sex Charge: Right-Wing Figure Accused in Dallas of Lewdness", [[United Press International]], ''The New York Times'', July 9, 1976, p. 84.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914396-1,00.html Catch as Catch Can]," ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', July 26, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Trial for Walker Routinely Passed", ''Dallas Morning News'', September 15, 1976, p. D4.&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested again in Dallas for public lewdness on March 16, 1977.&lt;ref&gt;"Police Arrest Retired General for Lewdness," ''Dallas Morning News'', March 17, 1977, p. B18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"General Walker Free on Bond", ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 18, 1977, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; He pleaded [[Nolo contendere]] (no contest) to one of the two misdemeanor charges, was given a [[suspended sentence|suspended]] and a 30-day jail sentence and fined $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;"Judge Convicts, Fines Walker", ''Dallas Morning News'', May 23, 1977, p. A5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker died of [[lung cancer]] at his home in Dallas during 1993, one week and three days before his 84th birthday.&lt;ref name=nyt-obituary&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pace|first1=Eric |title=Gen. Edwin Walker, 83, Is Dead; Promoted Rightist Causes in 60's |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/02/obituaries/gen-edwin-walker-83-is-dead-promoted-rightist-causes-in-60-s.html |accessdate=February 21, 2016 |work=The New York Times |date=November 2, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was never married and did not have any children.

==Media presentations==
*Together with Air Force General [[Curtis LeMay]], Walker was said to have inspired the character of the Air Force General James Mattoon Scott (played by [[Burt Lancaster]]) for the movie ''[[Seven Days in May]]''; Walker is also referred to in the movie.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=u6lxbxpbOE0C&amp;pg=PA170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Presidents We Imagine: Two Centuries of White House Fictions ...'', p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;
*He was said to have inspired the character of General Jack D. Ripper (played by [[Sterling Hayden]]) in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s anti-war movie, ''[[Dr. Strangelove]].''&lt;ref&gt;''America's Uncivil Wars: The Sixties Era from Elvis to the Fall of ...'', p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] portrays Walker as a supporting character in the 1985 film ''[[Prince Jack]]'' (1985). It includes Walker's perspective in a dramatization of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]'s assassination attempt against him at home.
*Oswald's attempted assassination of Walker is part of ''[[11/22/63]]'', a novel by [[Stephen King]], about a time traveler who tries to prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. In ''[[11.22.63]]'', a television adaptation of King's novel, Walker is portrayed by Gregory North.
*Oswald's assassination attempt on Walker is also part of ''The Third Bullet'', a [[Bob Lee Swagger]] novel by [[Stephen Hunter]].
*Walker is a character in ''The Bettor'', an alternative history novel by Tim Parise, where he is described as attempting to stage a coup by seizing control of [[The Pentagon]] during anti-communist riots during 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bettor|last=Parise|first=Tim|date=2014|publisher=The Maui Company|pages=404–406, 414–417|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3603">'''Global news flow''' (also referred to as '''international news flow''') is a field of study that deals with the news coverage of events in foreign countries. It describes and explains the flow of news from one country to another.&lt;ref name="segev"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.peterlang.com/view/product/31394|title=International News Online: Global Views with Local Perspectives|last=Segev|first=Elad|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2016|isbn=9781433129841|location=New York|page=139-153|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on global news flow typically attempt to understand why certain countries are more newsworthy than others..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kariel|first1=Herbert G.|last2=Rosenvall|first2=Lynn A.|title=Factors influencing international news flow|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly|date=1984|volume=61|issue=3|page=509-516|doi=10.1177/107769908406100305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kim, K., &amp; Barnett, G. A. (1996). The determinants of international news flow a network analysis. Communication Research, 23(3), 323-352.&lt;/ref&gt; Along the years it has been found that the economic power of countries plays a particularly crucial role in their news prominence&lt;ref name="segev_blondheim"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segev|first1=Elad|last2=Blondheim|first2=Menahem|title=America's global standing according to popular news sites from around the world|journal=Political Communication|date=2013|volume=30|issue=1|page=139-161|doi=10.1080/10584609.2012.737418|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2012.737418|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the presence of international news agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, H. D. (2000). Systemic determinants of international news coverage: A comparison of 38 countries. Journal of Communication, 50(2), 110-130.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the US has been found to be very prominent in news mentions around the world (18%), followed by China, Western European and Middle Eastern countries (about 3-5% each).&lt;ref name="segev" /&gt;

The unequal representation of the world and the under-representation of [[developing countries]] have been already of a great concern at least since the 1950s, since they influence the way people perceive the world and the image of countries.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (1954). How Nations See Each Other? Paris: UNESCO Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem was later addressed in the [[MacBride report]], and his set of recommendations for a [[New World Information and Communication Order]]. The unequal representation of the world has been also linked to the [[World System Theory]], and the unequal economic structure of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, T. K. (1998). All Countries Not Created Equal to Be News World System and International Communication. Communication research, 25(5), 528-563.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent empirical studies&lt;ref name="segev_blondheim" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Segev|first=Elad|title=Visible and invisible countries: News flow theory revised|journal=Journalism|date=2015|volume=16|issue=3|page=412-428|doi=10.1177/1464884914521579|url=http://jou.sagepub.com/content/16/3/412|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that among online news websites and [[news aggregators]] the unequal representation of the world has been perpetuated and even further intensified. Economically powerful countries, as well as their opponent countries (mainly in the Middle East and Asia) get the most news coverage around the world.

'''Green shoots''' is a term used colloquially and propagandistically to indicate signs of economic recovery during an [[economic downturn]]. It was first used in this sense by [[Norman Lamont (1942)|Norman Lamont]], the then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] of the [[United Kingdom]], during the [[Early 1990s recession|1991 Recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Sparrow | first=Andrew | title=No 10 disowns minister's 'green shoots' comment | date=2009-03-18 | publisher=Guardian UK | accessdate=2009-06-26 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/18/vera-baird-green-shoots}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Chancellor Lamont was criticized for "insensitivity".&lt;ref name="BBC Green Shoots"&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7828549.stm 'Green shoots' remarks defended ]'', BBC News, 14 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was used again by [[Baroness Vadera]], former [[Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform|Business Minister]] of the UK in January, 2009 to refer to signs of economic recovery during the [[late-2000s recession]], again to criticism from the media and opposition politicians.&lt;ref name="BBC Green Shoots"/&gt; The U.S. media started to use the phrase to describe domestic economic conditions in February 2009 when in New York Times quoted [[Bruce Kasman]], chief economist at JPMorgan Chase as saying, "It's too early to get excited, but I think there are a couple of green shoots that say  we're not going down as heavily in the first quarter [of 2009] as we were in the fourth quarter [of 2008]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Healy | first=Jack | title=Data Hints As Slowing of Decline | date=2009-02-17 | publisher=NYTimes | accessdate=2009-06-21 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/business/economy/17econ.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Reserve]] Chairman, [[Ben Bernanke]], made the first public use of the phrase by a Fed official in a March 15, 2009 interview with [[CBS]] [[60 Minutes]].

==Reviews==
“... at every turn, Jackman seems to make it abundantly clear that in this moment — whether he’s riffing on the golden days of the movie musical, or feeling his way through a deeply memorable rendition of Carousel’s ‘Soliloquy,’ or reprising lesser-known Allen songs such as ‘Tenterfield Saddler’ or ‘Once Before I Go’ — there is nowhere else he would rather be. And no one else for whom he would rather be doing it. In the face of such open-hearted generosity, there’s probably not a single person in his audience who doesn’t know exactly how he feels.”
— CANOE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Theatre/Reviews/H/Hugh_Jackman_In_Concert/2011/07/06/18383521.html |title=CANOE - JAM! Theatre - Hugh Jackman In Concert Review - Jackman unleashes charm on T.O |website=Jam.canoe.ca |date=2011-07-06 |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Hugh Jackman in Concert doesn’t feel like a career move – it feels like fun, the work of a talented performer unexpectedly given the chance to do what he loves just for the hell of it. But where another star might have let that opportunity sour into a statement of ego, Jackman lets the audience share in his passion and his fun. It’s hard to imagine him ever having a better role.”

==Biography==

Having joined the [[Pakistan Navy]] in 1947, he progressed well in the Navy and was trained in [[Military signals|signals]] in [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Britannia Royal Naval College]] in [[England]] before returning to Pakistan in 1954 where he served in the [[HMS Nadder (K392)|PNS ''Shamsher'']] as [[Lieutenant (naval)|Lieutenant]].{{rp|100}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sirohey|first1=Iftikhar Ahmed|title=Truth Never Retires: An Autobiography of Admiral Iftikhar Ahmed Sirohey|date=1995|publisher=Jang Publishers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-IHjAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Truth+Never+Retires%3A+An+Autobiography+of+Admiral+Iftikhar+Ahmed+Sirohey&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=I+F+Quadir|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1965, [[Commander (rank)|Commander]] Iqbal F. Quadir was among the [[Commanding officer|commanding officer]] who were chosen to be a part of the  [[Flotilla|flotilla]] led under [[Commodore (rank)|Cdre.]] [[S. M. Anwar|S.M. Anwar]] to  [[Operation Dwarka|attacked the radar station]] in [[Dwarka]], [[India]], where he commanded the [[HMS Creole (R82)|PNS ''Alamgir'']].&lt;ref name="PakDef Military Consortium"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Usman|first1=Shabbir|title=1965 War|url=http://pakdef.org/1965-war-3/|website=pakdef.org|accessdate=9 August 2017|language=en|format=html|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Commander (rank)|Cdr.]] Quadir was in charge of the [[Signals intelligence|signals]] eventually helping to identify the targets for flotilla to launch the attack.&lt;ref name="ISPR Hilal Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quadir, PN|first1=Vice-Admiral Iqbal F.|title=A Veteran’s Account: Remembering the 1965 War at Sea|url=http://hilal.gov.pk/index.php/layouts/item/2289-a-veteran-s-account-remembering-the-1965-war-at-sea|publisher=ISPR Hilal Magazine|accessdate=9 August 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to  [[Commander (rank)|Cdr.]] Quadir, the [[Indian Naval Air Arm|Indian Navy]]'s reconnaissance plane had flown over his ship and observed flight path of the plane in the radar, as it flown over his ship, [[HMS Diadem (84)|''Babur'']] and [[HMS Gabbard (D47)|''Badr'']] but was unable to detect due to clouds covering the area.&lt;ref name="ISPR Hilal Magazine"/&gt; Upon returning to Pakistan, he was decorated with the gallantry award.&lt;ref name="ISPR Hilal Magazine" /&gt; 

In 1971, Cdr. Quadir was stationed in [[East Pakistan|East]], and was taken as [[Prisoners of war during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|war prisoner]] by the [[Indian Army]] and was repatriated back to Pakistan in 1974.{{rp|250}}&lt;ref name="Dar-ut-Tazkeer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haq, PAF|first1=Air Cdre Inamul|title=Memoirs of Insignificance|date=1999|publisher=Dar-ut-Tazkeer|location=Lahore|pages=276|url=|accessdate=8 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to Pakistan, he continued to served in the Navy and eventually promoted at the commanding ranks in the Navy. In 1970s, [[Captain (naval)|Capt.]] Quadir served in the [[NHQ (Pakistan Navy)|Navy NHQ]] as [[Chief of Staff]] (COS) for Commander of Pakistan Fleet (COMPAK).{{rp|227}}&lt;ref name="Jang Publishers, Sirohey"/&gt; In 1978, [[Rear-Admiral]] Quadir was appointed as Commander of Karachi (COMKAR).{{rp|428}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gazette of Pakistan|date=1978|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9LpPAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Rear+Admiral+I.F.+Quadir+Commander+Karachi&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Rear+Admiral+I.F.+Quadir+|accessdate=9 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, he was promoted to three-star rank, [[Vice-Admiral]], in the [[Pakistan Navy]] and tenured as the [[Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan)|Vice-Chief of Naval Staff]] under Adm. [[Karamat Rahman Niazi]], the [[Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan)|chief of naval staff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Defence Journal|date=1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qYrfAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Iqbal+F.+Quadir+navy&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Iqbal+F.+Quadir+navy|accessdate=9 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1983, Vice-Admiral Quadir was superseded by junior [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Tariq Kamal Khan|T.K. Khan]] for the four-star rank promotion, since the Rear-Admiral Khan had been known to be close to President Zia and had experience in military administration in civil affairs from the East Pakistan, that may have been a factor for his appointment to the four-star appointment.{{rp|277}}&lt;ref name="Jang Publishers, Sirohey"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sirohey|first1=Iftikhar Ahmed|authorlink1=Iftikhar Ahmed Sirohey|title=Truth Never Retires: An Autobiography of Admiral Iftikhar Ahmed Sirohey|date=1995|publisher=Jang Publishers|location=Karachi Pakistan|isbn=978-969-8500-00-9|pages=592|edition=1|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his appointment was announced, Rear-Admiral Tariq Kamal Khan was appointed as [[four-star rank|four-star]] rank [[admiral]] in the Navy.{{rp|277-278}}&lt;ref name="Jang Publishers, Sirohey"/&gt;

After his seeking retirement in 1983, Quadir was appointed as ambassador and serve on various countries as a diplomat. He has been a prolific contributor in Defence Journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Playing clever with God|url=http://www.defencejournal.com/2002/july/god.htm|website=www.defencejournal.com|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shahadat by the Naval Aircrew|url=http://defencejournal.com/nov99/naval.htm|website=defencejournal.com|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2015, he has appeared in television news media to euologize the events in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dwarka {{!}} SAMAA TV|url=https://www.samaa.tv/tag/dwarka/|website=www.samaa.tv|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the movement was entirely devoid of any [[anti-Soviet]] sentiment and did not call for independence of Armenia. The [[Karabakh Committee]], a group of intellectuals, led the movement from 1988 to 1989. It transformed into the [[Pan-Armenian National Movement]] (HHSh) by 1989 and won majority in the 1990 parliamentary election. In 1991, both Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence. The intense fighting known as the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] turned into a full-scale war by 1992.

The so-called '''Latvian Operation''' ({{lang-ru|Латышская операция}}) '''of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs''' ([[NKVD]]) was a mass arrest and execution of persons of [[Latvians|Latvian]] origin in the [[Soviet Union]] during the period of [[Great Purge]] (1937–1938).

==Latvians in the Soviet Union until 1936==
More than 500 Latvian peasant colonies originated from the 19th century after the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolition of serfdom]] near [[St. Petersburg]], [[Novgorod]] and in [[Siberia]]. As the front line of Courland was approaching in the [[First World War]], extensive forced evacuations were carried out, so that the number of Latvians living in Russia doubled to up to 500,000 people. Many of the [[Latvian Riflemen]] were the early supporters of the [[Bolsheviks]] in 1917. With the end of the World War and the [[Russian Civil War]], many of the refugees were able to return to an independent Latvia. The Riga peace treaty explicitly foresaw the departure of former Latvian riflemen and refugees. According to the 1926 census, about 150,000 Latvians lived in the Soviet Union. They cultivated a lively [[Latvian culture|cultural life]] with the schools, newspapers and theaters. Since the [[1905 Russian Revolution|1905 Revolution]], there has been a strong Latvian faction in the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]. Persons of Latvian descent temporarily held the high positions in the State apparatus of Soviet Russia. Of 70 Commissioners of the [[Cheka]] were in the year 1918 38 were of Latvian origin. However, with the increasing Russification of the State organs, members of non-Russian minorities were largely ousted from the management positions. In the party leadership of Josef Stalin, Latvia was regarded as a so-called "enemy nation" and Latvians were generally regarded as counter-revolutionary and suspicious. The resistance of peasant colonists to the forced collectivization at the end of the 1920s seemed to confirm to this image. Through targeted deportations in the [[Gulag]], these colonies were eliminated by 1933. From this time, a rigorous "purge" of the party and state apparatus of non-Russians took place. The [[Latvian Communist Party]] was dissolved in 1936, its members persecuted and murdered as "nationalists" and "people's enemies". One aspect of Stalin's [[Great Purge]] was state-directed xenophobia. In July 1937 the closure of the publishing house and cultural association "Prometejs" and the arrest of its employees took place. The Red Latvian Riflemen were removed from the history and school books and their veteran associations were dissolved.

==The operation==
On November 23, 1937, [[Nikolai Yezhov]] ordered the [[NKVD]] services to pool all the information gathered about Latvians in cultural and political life, the military and other institutions to be able to arrest them "just as during the Polish operation". On 30 November, the Order No. 49990 was the mass arrest of ethnic Latvians throughout the Soviet Union. The lawsuits were streamlined by forms with pre-printed accusations and confessions, which then condemned judicial victims to criminal work or shooting. Through torture, the NKVD constructed the existence of a Latvian espionage circle, which allegedly belonged to all Latvian officials from the [[Politburo]] to the school directors. The last Latvian Chekists were now also executed by their colleagues. Due to the large number of detainees, despite the so-called album proceedings, the courts were unable to impose convictions quickly enough. Therefore, the finish date of the action was extended until August 1938. In October 1938, special Troikas were then set up to work out the backlog of unedited cases. When the successor of Yezhov, [[Lavrenty Beria]] issued the command No. 00762 on November 26, 1938, the Latvian operation ended with the conclusion of the Great Purge. The liquidation of the Latvian party officials gave the Soviet authorities certain difficulties in establishing a party and administrative apparatus in the [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940|occupation of Latvia 1940]].

==Deaths resulting from the operation==
In particular, 22,369 convictions of Latvians were known, of which 16,573 or 74% were shot. Various estimates are based on 73,000 Latvian casualties. Exact victim numbers are also not available because many other people were murdered under the pretext of "Latvians". Women who were sent to the gulag because of a marriage with the ethnic enemies and their children who came to orphanages were not included in the statistics. The operation led to the abandonment of their own culture among the remaining Latvians, so descendants of Latvian colonists barely speak [[Latvian language|Latvian]] today. A rehabilitation of the victims took place under [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]]. Information about the specific death and date could only be obtained after the end of the communist rule after 1990. The perpetrators and performers of the action, often known by name, have never been held accountable. Larger groups of victims were shot at the practice places [[Butovo firing range|Butovo]] and [[Kommunarka]] near [[Moscow]], [[Levaschovo]] near [[Leningrad]] or [[Kurapaty]] near [[Minsk]]. However, the tortures and murders were carried out throughout the territory of the State.

==History==

Lone Tree was a solitary [[Populus deltoides|cottonwood tree]], which stood on the north side of the [[Platte River]] about three miles southwest of where [[Central City, Nebraska|Central City]] is located. The trunk of the tree was about {{convert|10|to|12|ft}} in circumference at the base and was about {{convert|50|ft}} tall. It was a landmark, it was claimed, which could be seen for {{convert|20|mi}} across the prairie by early travelers.&lt;ref name = "WPA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheldon"/&gt;

[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] knew the tree and named it (though the name is not known) before the [[American pioneer|pioneers]] came. Legend has it that Native American chiefs held council under its shade.&lt;ref name="Sheldon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt;

It was a landmark for pioneers as early as 1833. In 1858, it was selected by Western Stage Co. as the site for the Lone Tree Station.&lt;ref name="LT1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lone Tree Monument|url=http://www.centralnebraskaadventures.com/detail.php?listingID=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1860 to 1861, the [[Pony Express|Western Stage Company station]] was built and operating.  The huge cottonwood tree marked its location, which was operated by Mary Hilton from 1860 to 1861.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt;

In 1858, the [[Nebraska Legislature|Nebraska Territorial Legislature]] established Merrick County and designated "Elvira" as its mythical county seat located under Lone Tree near present day [[Central City, Nebraska|Central City]].&lt;ref name ="Kay"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kay|first=John, Lonnie Dickson, Robert Kay, and Kathleen Fimple (1992)|title=Nebraska Historic Buildings Survey Reconnaissance Survey Final Report of Merrick County, Nebraska.|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/histpres/reports/merrick_county.pdf|publisher=Nebraska State Historical Society: State Historic Preservation Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1865 storm===
[[File:Lone tree Nebraska State Historical Marker-12-26-12.JPG|thumb|upright|Lone Tree Landmark: [[Nebraska State Historical Society]], Marker 92]]
In 1865, a great storm blew the tree over. The tree had died in 1863&lt;ref name= NSHS/&gt; and this was thought the consequence of two factors. First, as pioneers passed along the [[Overland Trail]] and [[Mormon Trail]], they made carvings in its bark, thereby gradually destroying it.&lt;ref name = "WPA"/&gt; Second, pioneers often built campfires at the base of the tree, which may have further weakened it.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; Part of its trunk was taken to Lone Tree station (which later became Central City) and placed on the depot platform. Over time, fragments of it were carried away by tourists until it disappeared.&lt;ref name="Sheldon"/&gt;

===Lone Tree (Central City)===

In 1866, the mythical Merrick county seat of Elvira was given an actual location in a town called "Lone Tree," which, in 1875, would be renamed "Central City."&lt;ref name="cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="cc1"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="cc2"/&gt;

===1911 monument===

Although the original Lone Tree had long disappeared, the people of Merrick county had not forgotten its historical significance. In 1911, they erected a granite monument. Thirty years later, another cottonwood tree was planted at the original tree's location next to the granite monument. In 1911, there were also two dedications of the monument, one on August 9, 1911 and a second rededication of it on July 3, 2011.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt;

'''''Nat Tate: An American Artist 1928–1960''''' is a 1998 novel, presented as a biography, by the Scottish writer [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]].  Nat Tate was an imaginary person, invented by Boyd and created as "an abstract expressionist who destroyed '99%' of his work and leapt to his death from the Staten Island ferry. His body was never found."&lt;ref name=NW98&gt;{{Citation | last=Plagens | first=Peter | title=The Late Great Tate | journal=[[Newsweek]] | date=20 April 1998 | page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of the novel's launch, Boyd went some way to encourage the belief that Tate had really existed.

== Art hoax ==
Boyd published the book as a [[hoax]], presented as a real biography. [[Gore Vidal]], [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] ([[Pablo Picasso|Picasso's]] biographer), Karen Wright (then editor of the influential [[Modern Painters (magazine)|''Modern Painters'']] magazine) and [[David Bowie]] (a board member of ''Modern Painters'' and co-director with Karen Wright of [[21 Publishing]], which published the book) were all participants in the hoax. "Nat Tate" is a combination of the names of two London art galleries, the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] and the [[Tate Gallery]]. Boyd and his conspirators set about convincing the New York glitterati (social elites) that the reputation of this influential abstract expressionist needed to be re-evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Biography of William Boyd |url=http://www.bookbrowse.com/biographies/index.cfm?author_number=851 |publisher=BookBrowse.com |accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowie held a launch party on [[April Fool's Day]] eve, 1998,&lt;ref name=NW98 /&gt; and read extracts from the book, while Richardson talked about Tate's friendships with both Picasso and [[Braque]].

About a week later, journalist David Lister, who was at the New York launch, reported in ''[[The Independent (London)|The Independent]]'' of London that "some of the biggest names in the art world have been the victims of a literary hoax", and the story was picked up by other newspapers, including ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=NW98 /&gt; He said that no one he spoke to claimed to know Tate well, but no one claimed not to have heard of him.  He said he sniffed something fishy, since he appeared to be the only person in the room who had never heard of Tate. His suspicions were confirmed when he discovered that none of the galleries mentioned in the book actually existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Indian Express]]|location=Bombay|date=1998-04-11|title=Work of fiction fools literary world|url=http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19980411/10150314.html|accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2016, Lister had become ''[[The Independent]]''{{'}}s Arts Editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=15 January 2016|title=David Bowie: How I exposed the pop star's fake artist|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/david-bowie-how-i-exposed-the-pop-stars-fake-artist-a6814981.html|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, it appears that few were fooled and most of the big names in the arts world (including artists, collectors, art historian, art dealers, New York based writers like [[Paul Auster]], and editors of literary journals) quickly realized that Nat Tate was a complete fake and that they had been the victims of an elaborate setup.&lt;ref name=NW98 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |publisher= BBC |title=Bowie and Boyd hoax art world |date= 1998-04-07 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/75207.stm |accessdate= 2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the paintings featured in the book were reportedly painted by Boyd and the hoax was made more believable by Gore Vidal's endorsement on the book's dust cover. Also, the photographs of Nat Tate that feature in the 'biography' are of unknown people from Boyd's own photographic collection.

Karen Wright, one of Bowie's co-directors at 21 Publishing, said the hoax was not meant to be malicious: "Part of it was, we were very amused that people kept saying 'Yes, I've heard of him.' There is a willingness not to appear foolish. Critics are too proud for that."&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; Boyd, the main perpetrator of the hoax, agreed, saying "the doubts were meant to set in very quickly."&lt;ref name=NW98 /&gt;

According to his inventor's fictitious biography, Nathwell "Nat" Tate was born "probably" in Union Beach, New Jersey on March 7, 1928.  His father, for whom he was named, deserted the family before Tate's birth.  From the age of 3, Tate, an only child, lived in [[Peconic, New York|Peconic]], [[Long Island]], New York, with his mother Mary, who worked as a kitchen maid for a wealthy family. Mary was killed in a traffic accident in February, 1936, shortly before Tate's eighth birthday, and Tate was subsequently adopted by the family with whom he and his mother had been living.

Always interested in painting and drawing, Tate studied painting with [[Hans Hofmann]] in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] from 1947 until 1950, and began showing his work in exhibitions of [[abstract art]] in New York City in 1952.  His adoptive family supported Tate, paying for his lessons and also buying much of his artwork.  Tate became a respected, albeit minor, figure in the New York art scene, appreciated by his peers, if somewhat obscure to the general public.  A recurring motif in his works was the representation of bridges, which was partly inspired by his readings of the works of [[Hart Crane]].

An alcoholic, Tate became increasingly irrational towards the end of the decade.  After a trip to Europe in 1959, he became overwhelmed by the quality of art he saw there (especially that of [[Georges Braque]], whom Tate briefly visited). On his return to America, Tate insisted on borrowing or buying back his paintings from their owners, so he could "improve" them.  Apparently unhappy with his work, he then simply destroyed all of the paintings he reacquired—about 99% of his collected works, according to one estimate.  Emulating the death of Hart Crane, Tate committed suicide on January 12, 1960, by jumping off the Staten Island ferry.

== Later appearances ==
William Boyd included Nat Tate as a minor character in his novel ''[[Any Human Heart]]'', and in its TV adaptation.

In 2011, a painting by "Nat Tate" entitled ''Bridge no. 114'' was auctioned at [[Sotheby's]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:cs96OkrfRvUJ:www.sothebys.com/en/ecat.pdf.L11142.html/f/214/L11142-214.pdf+sotheby's+nat+tate+catalogue&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESj8xuO8Ihrq2V6EPVOhVUyE_zhR-r7XxI2zX89TWtGWKRRlzp4NuoOpOHAohlj5oplegIsZ4pel0B8Lfdkd8ZnvZ0cGWjrmFuSUwnM1fAibJrryzr0JGpROmNILpjvfOpr716Sx&amp;sig=AHIEtbTCO0dCI2AXHCM3mX0-7KARrjlLaw |title=Sothebys catalogue |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-27}} {{Dead link|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winning bid for the painting (which was actually by William Boyd) was £7,250, well above the expected price, with the purchaser later revealed to be English television personality [[Anthony McPartlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/9051600/The-master-storyteller-William-Boyd-interview.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Mick | last=Brown | title=The master storyteller: William Boyd interview | date=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money was given to the [[Artists' General Benevolent Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Maev Kennedy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/nov/16/nat-tate-painting-william-boyd|title=Painting by mythical artist Nat Tate sells for very real £7,250 at Sotheby's|work=The Guardian|date= 16 November 2011|accessdate=2013-02-27|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Night of the Proms''' is a series of concerts held annually in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, Denmark, Poland and the United States. Regularly there are also shows in France, Spain, Austria, Switzerland and Sweden. The concerts consist of [[pop music]] and popular [[classical music]] (often combined) and various well-known musicians and groups usually participate (see below).

Night of the Proms is the biggest annually organised indoor event in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Night of the Proms is based on the [[The Proms#Last Night of the Proms|Last Night of the Proms]], the last concert of the [[The Proms|BBC Proms]], a series of seventy or so classical concerts held yearly in the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, but it is organised independently.&lt;ref name="origins"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.notp.com/english/history/ |title=History |work=notp.com |date=2008 |accessdate=24 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though its inclusion of large portions of pop music does not match its British counterpart and originator, it did share certain elements for a time, such as the tradition of ending the performance with the British patriotic song [[Land of Hope and Glory]].&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; The closing song has varied every year since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huybrechts|first1=Carl|title=Night of the Proms een terugblik vanuit de coulissen|date=2012|publisher=Borgerhoff &amp; Lamberigts|isbn=9789089313164|pages=45-50|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/901643210|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Night of the Proms was created by two Belgian students, Jan Vereecke and Jan Van Esbroeck in 1985. The first NotP took place at the Antwerp [[Sportpaleis]] in Belgium on 19 October 1985.&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; Nowadays the event is organized by PSE Belgium (Promotion for Special Events), still managed by Vereecke and Van Esbroeck. PSE co-operates with local promoters (Mojo in the Netherlands, Dirk Hohmeyer in Germany, Niels Estrup in Scandinavia, Music Events Poland, etc.).

The '''Opéra de Nice''' is the principal opera venue in [[Nice]], France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opera-nice.org/ Opéra de Nice official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

It offers three types of performances: operas, ballets and classical concerts ; and houses the Ballet Nice Méditerrannée and the Nice Philharmonic Orchestra.

==History==
The “petit théâtre en bois” (wooden theatre) was first created in 1776 by Marquess Alli-Maccarani. Sold in 1787 to a group of gentry,&lt;ref name="paris"&gt;Pâris, Alain. Opéra de Nice. In: ''Dictionnaire des interprètes''. Éditions Robert Laffont, Paris, 1995, p1152-53.&lt;/ref&gt;  it reopened in 1790 under the name “Théâtre Royal”.

In 1826, the city of Nice, encouraged by King [[Charles Felix of Sardinia|Charles Félix]], bought it from its owners and had it demolished and rebuilt. It was inaugurated in 1828 with [[Giovanni Pacini]]'s ''Il Barone di Bolsheim''.

In 1856, a great ball was organized in the honour of King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]].

In 1860, [[Napoleon III]] was invited to attend an evening at the Théâtre Royal. For this special occasion, [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]] led the orchestra. The same year, the theatre became the “Théâtre Impérial”. In 1864, Napoleon III returned, accompanied by Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]]. In 1868, [[Louis II, Duke of Bavaria]] attended a performance of ''[[Cendrillon (Isouard)|Cendrillon]]''. The Théâtre Royal was renamed “Théâtre Municipal” in 1870.

On Wednesday, March 23rd 1881, as the opera ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' began, a gas leak started a huge fire. The fire was controlled the next day but there was nothing left of the theatre. Three siblings of [[Marjory Kennedy-Fraser]] died in the fire: Lizzie, Kate and James (soprano, contralto and baritone respectively).
The city of Nice immediately decided to rebuild another theatre on the same site. It was designed by architect François Aune with the apparent approval of [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], the architect of the Paris Opera.&lt;ref name="paris"/&gt; On February 7th 1885, the Théâtre Municipal re-opened with [[Verdi]]’s ''[[Aida]]''.&lt;ref name="IvanAA"&gt;Alexandre. Ivan A. Nice pour mémoire. ''[[Diapason (magazine)|Diapason]]'' 649, September 2016, p9.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following years it hosted the French stage premieres of operas such as ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'', ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'', ''[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]'', ''[[Manon Lescaut (Puccini)|Manon Lescaut]]'', ''[[Marie-Magdeleine]]'', ''[[Katerina Ismailova]]'' and ''[[Elegy for Young Lovers]]''.&lt;ref name="paris"/&gt; Artistic directors included [[Edoardo Sonzogno]] (1887-88), [[Raoul Gunsbourg]] (1889-91) and Ferdinand Aymé (1950-82). Musical directors included [[Alexandre Luigini]] (1888-89 and 1897-98), [[Albert Wolff (conductor)|Albert Wolff]] (1930-32 and 1934-37), [[Antonio de Almeida (conductor)|Antonio de Almeida]] (1976-78) and [[Pierre Dervaux]] (1978-82).&lt;ref name="paris"/&gt;

In 1902, it was named Opéra de Nice and is today referred to as Opéra Nice Côte d’Azur.

With the support of the Médecin family of Nice, the house flourished, attracting major singers and directors in opera, but despite the efforts of [[Jean-Albert Cartier]] from 1994-1997, the importance of the house declined.&lt;ref name="IvanAA"/&gt;

==21st century==
From 2001 to 2009 the director-general was the Belgian producer Paul-Émile Fourny. He was succeeded by Jacques Hédouin, with a policy of closer working with the [[Opéra de Monte-Carlo]], as well as closer collaboration with the two regional orchestras, the Orchestre Philharmonique de Nice and the Orchestre régional de Cannes-Provence-Alpes-Côte-d’Azur.&lt;ref&gt;Fauchet B. Nice people. ''[[Diapason (magazine)|Diapason]]'' 572S, September 2009, p9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, Marc Adam became the new artistic director of the opera. The same month tenor [[Jonas Kaufmann]] performed there. Adam departed in 2015 to be replaced by Eric Chevalier.&lt;ref name="IvanAA"/&gt;

The Diacosmie is the workshop of the Opéra de Nice, where everything from costumes to sets is created. The building also houses rehearsal rooms for the Nice Philharmonic Orchestra and the Ballet Nice Méditerrannée.

'''''Piece of My Heart: The Bert Berns Story''''' is a [[jukebox musical]] with a book by Daniel Goldfarb and music and lyrics by [[Bert Berns]]. Based on the life and music of songwriter and record producer [[Bert Berns]], the musical made its world premiere [[Off Broadway]] at the [[Pershing Square Signature Center]] on July 21, 2014.

==Background==
[[Bert Berns]] is a vastly influential figure in the history of American music, yet his extraordinary impact went widely unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Robert. [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/books/review/here-comes-the-night-by-joel-selvin.html "Hit Man"] The New York Times, 30 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called Berns "one of the great untold stories of rock and roll."&lt;ref&gt;Selvin, Joel. ''Here Comes the Night: The Dark Soul of Bert Berns and the Dirty Business of Rhythm and Blues.''  Counterpoint Press, 2014, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; He is responsible for some of the most enduring classics of sixties pop and R&amp;B, and has been credited with bringing Latin rhythms into rock and roll and the creation of New York Uptown Soul.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Eric. [http://blogcritics.org/new-bert-berns-collection/ "New Bert Berns Collection"] BlogCritics, 20 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Berns died in 1967 at the young age of 38 due to a rheumatic heart condition, and his children Brett Berns and Cassandra Berns conceived of the musical as part of a concerted effort to champion his legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Suzy. [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/first-look-at-piece-my-711871 "First Look at 'Piece of My Heart: The Bert Berns Story'"] The Hollywood Reporter, 13 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; With his autobiographical body of work and dramatic life story, the musical's creators used Berns' canon to tell his story through his own songs.&lt;ref&gt;Haun, Harry. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/from-tell-him-to-twist-and-shout-piece-of-my-heart-looks-at-the-man-behind--323223 "From "Tell Him" to "Twist and Shout": Piece of My Heart Looks at the Man Behind the Music"] Playbill.com, 06 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohter, Larry.

''Piece of My Heart'' follows the story of Berns' rise in the music business, and his daughter's search for the father she never knew.  Berns died from heart failure when his daughter was an infant, and she comes to know him through his music over the course of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, Briana. [http://www.backstage.com/interview/the-heart-off-broadway "The 'Heart' of Off-Broadway"] Backstage, 15 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Music and lyrics were written by [[Bert Berns]], either alone or with a variety of co-writers.&lt;ref&gt;Rohter, Larry. [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/arts/music/bert-berns-songwriter-and-producer-remembered.html?_r=0 "Many Hit Wonder, Out of Obscurity"] The New York Times, 16 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The songs range from Berns' greatest hits ("Twist and Shout," "Piece of My Heart," "Tell Him," "[[Hang On Sloopy]]", "Cry Baby," "I Want Candy," "Cry To Me," "Here Comes the Night," "Everybody Needs Somebody to Love") to some of his more obscure work ("Show Me Your Monkey," "Let the Water Run Down," "Heart Be Still").

==Critical response==

Laura Collins-Hughes, in her review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote: "Filling that gap in our rock 'n' roll awareness is the mission behind the gorgeously tuneful, new jukebox musical "Piece of My Heart: The Bert Berns Story - and if your first response to that title is "Bert who?," well, that's exactly the point...When Bert Berns died at 38 in 1967, he left a voluminous catalog, and "Piece of My Heart" taps it expertly. "Twist and Shout," "I Want Candy," "[[Hang On Sloopy]]" and "Everybody Needs Somebody to Love" are among the many familiar songs that the show's stellar singers and splendid eight-piece orchestra may lodge in your brain.&lt;ref&gt;Collins-Hughes, Laura. [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/theater/piece-of-my-heart-tells-the-story-of-bert-berns.html?_r=0 "She Never Knew Dad - Just His Hit Songs"] The New York Times, 21 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeremy Gerard of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' wrote: "Jukebox musicals are the guilty pleasures of Broadway, and ever more frequently, off-Broadway, offering well-heeled patrons the joys of nostalgia and the reassuring sense that the songs we grew up on were classics worthy of revisiting. How else to account for the extraordinary popularity of ''Jersey Boys'', ''Beautiful: The Carole King Musical'', ''Motown: The Musical'', ''The Million Dollar Quartet'', ''Smokey Joe's Cafe'', ''Mamma Mia!'' and ''Rock of Ages''?  ''Piece of My Heart: The Bert Berns Story'', which opened Sunday night on 42nd Street, is a bargain-basement jukebox musical as entertaining as the best of those shows... So: Bert Who?...That's the point of ''Piece of My Heart'', the irresistible show with a weird but effective book by Daniel Goldfarb, songs by Berns performed by a cast that goes into overdrive to win our sympathy (they succeed) and a production directed and choreographed by Denis Jones that manages to embrace every cliche of the jukebox genre, and still hold us rapt."&lt;ref&gt;Gerard, Jeremy.

YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;

The video follows Bastille frontman [[Dan Smith (British singer)|Dan Smith]], as he wanders about an empty-looking [[Los Angeles]], before realizing the few people around all have unnatural vacant [[Scleral lens#Use in special effects|black eyes]]. He steals a car and drives into the desert to escape them, but the car breaks down and he soon realizes he's been infected as well. He climbs a mountain and looks out at the view, before turning around to reveal his own eyes meanwhile have turned black as well. The story is an [[allegory]] for the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] in [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref name="RadioX"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4789">'''Prohibition in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union''' existed during 1914–25. The Russian term is "сухой закон" (''sukhoy zakon'', literally "[[dry law]]").

== Russian Empire ==

[[Prohibition]] as introduced in the [[Russian Empire]] in 1914 permitted the sale of [[hard liquor]] only in [[restaurants]]. It was introduced at the beginning of [[World War I]] under the premise that it would prevent the army from dealing with drunken soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18880?msg=welcome_stranger|title=The New York Times Current History: the European War, February, 1915 by Various|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2018|via=www.gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other warring countries (e.g. the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Germany]]) imposed certain restrictions on [[alcoholic beverage|alcoholic drinks]], but only Russia completely stopped the retail sale of [[vodka]].&lt;ref&gt;I.N. Vvedensky, [http://www.tvereza.info/downloads/literature/forcedabstinenceexperience_ru.html#fae-results An Experience in Enforced Abstinence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221151810/http://tvereza.info/downloads/literature/forcedabstinenceexperience_ru.html |date=2008-12-21 }} (1915), Moscow (Введенский И. Н. Опыт принудительной трезвости. М.: Издание Московского Столичного Попечительства о Народной Трезвости, 1915.) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union==
Prohibition continued through the turmoil of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the [[Russian Civil War]], into the period of [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]] until 1925.&lt;ref&gt;D. Christian, ''Prohibition in Russia 1914–1925.'' Australian Slavonic and East European Studies, vol. 9 (1995), pp. 89&amp;ndash;108. &lt;/ref&gt;

In the Soviet Union, there were three major anti-alcohol campaigns: started in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecsocman.edu.ru/images/pubs/2006/01/23/0000247470/011.ZAIGRAEV.pdf|title=Г.&amp;nbsp;Г.&amp;nbsp;Заиграев.

=== Gorbachev's anti-alcohol campaign ===

During 1985–87, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] carried out an anti-alcohol campaign with partial prohibition,&lt;ref&gt;Decree of the USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium "On the Increased Struggle against Hard Drinking and Alcoholism", May 16, 1985 (Указ Президиума Верховного Совета СССР «Об усилении борьбы с пьянством и алкоголизмом»)&lt;/ref&gt; colloquially known as the "dry law". Prices of [[vodka]], [[wine]] and [[beer]] were raised, and their sales were restricted in amount and time of day. People who were caught drunk at work or in public were prosecuted.

The reform had an effect on alcoholism in the country, as evident from statistics showing some fall in criminality and rise in life expectancy, but economically it was a serious blow to the state budget (a loss of approximately 100 billion [[Russian ruble|rubles]] to the exchequer according to [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]]) after alcohol production migrated to the [[black market]] economy.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

'''Richard Colvin Reid''' (born 12 August 1973), also known as the '''Shoe Bomber''', is a British terrorist who attempted [[2001 failed shoe bomb attempt|to detonate an explosive device packed into his shoes]] while on [[American Airlines Flight 63]] from [[Paris]] to [[Miami]] in 2001. Born to a father who was a career criminal, Reid converted to [[Islam]] as a young man in prison after years as a petty criminal. Later he became radicalized and went to [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], where he trained and became a member of [[al-Qaeda]].

On 22 December 2001, he boarded American Airlines Flight 63 between Paris and Miami, wearing shoes packed with explosives, which he unsuccessfully tried to detonate. Passengers subdued him on the plane, which landed at [[Logan International Airport]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, the closest US airport. He was subsequently arrested and indicted. In 2002, Reid pleaded guilty in [[United States federal courts|U.S. federal court]] to eight federal criminal counts of [[terrorism]], based on his attempt to destroy a commercial aircraft in flight. He was sentenced to 3 life terms plus 110 years in prison without parole and is currently being held at [[ADX Florence]], a [[Supermax|super maximum security]] prison in the United States.

Reid was born in [[Bromley]], [[London]],&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/828/000058654/|title=Profile|publisher=NNDB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212134940/http://nndb.com/people/828/000058654/|archivedate=12 February 2010|df=dmy-all}} In an email sent to his mother, Reid stated he was part of the war "against unbelief" and was sacrificing his life to "help remove the oppressive American forces from the Muslim lands"&lt;/ref&gt; to Lesley Hughes, who was of native English descent, and Colvin Robin Reid, a man of mixed race whose father was a [[Jamaica]]n immigrant.&lt;ref name="time 02-12-02"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,203478,00.html|title=The Shoe Bomber's World|last=Elliott|first=Michael|date=12 February 2002|work=Time|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827143428/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,203478,00.html|archivedate=27 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Reid was born, his father, a career criminal, was in prison for stealing a car.&lt;ref name="time 02-12-02"/&gt; Reid attended [[Thomas Tallis School]] in Kidbrooke,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1366666/From-tearaway-to-terrorist-The-story-of-Richard-Reid.html|title=From tearaway to terrorist - The story of Richard Reid|first=Olga|last=Craig|date=30 December 2001|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805071820/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1366666/From-tearaway-to-terrorist-The-story-of-Richard-Reid.html|archivedate=5 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving at age 16 and becoming a graffiti writer who was in and out of jail.&lt;ref name="time 02-12-02"/&gt; He began writing [[graffiti]] under the name "Enrol" as part of the FRF crew,&lt;ref name="Millbank 2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Loner Vowed to Make His Evil Mark |last=Millbank|first=James|date=30 December 2001|work=News of the World|&lt;!-- accessdate=31 December 2009 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Observer 01-11-09"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jan/11/muslim-extremists-crime-gangs-london|title=Islamists target teen crime gangs in London|last=Syal|first=Rajeev|author2=Mark Townsend|date=11 January 2001|work=The Observer&lt;!-- accessdate=16 February 2010 --&gt;|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730015457/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jan/11/muslim-extremists-crime-gangs-london|archivedate=30 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately accumulated more than 10 convictions for crimes against persons and property.&lt;ref name="CNN 12-28-01"&gt;{{cite news|author1=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --&gt;|title=Judge denies bail to accused shoe bomber|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/28/inv.reid/|accessdate=9 December 2014|work=CNN|date=28 December 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050319141213/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/28/inv.reid/|archivedate=19 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served sentences at [[Feltham Young Offenders Institution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/01/07/reid.timeline/index.html|title=Timeline: The shoe bomber case|date=7 January 2002|publisher=CNN|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115082019/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/01/07/reid.timeline/index.html|archivedate=15 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Blundeston (HM Prison)|Maidstone Prison]].&lt;ref name="guardian 02-28-02"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/feb/28/september11.race|title=At school with the shoe bomber|last=Nzerem|first=Keme|date=28 February 2002|work=The Guardian|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826003758/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/feb/28/september11.race|archivedate=26 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next time Reid was incarcerated (in 1992 for various street robberies for 3 years), he converted to Islam.&lt;ref name="time 02-12-02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time 01-14-02"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,193661,00.html|title=Looking for Trouble|last=Gibson|first=Helen|date=14 January 2002|work=Time|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227185116/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,193661,00.html|archivedate=27 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reid reportedly followed a fundamentalist form of Islam known as [[Salafi]], which seeks a return to the roots of the religion and is the predominant form of Islam practiced in [[Saudi Arabia]]{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/wahhabism-a-deadly-scripture-398516.html|title=Wahhabism: A deadly scripture|date=1 November 2007|work=The Independent|5=&lt;!-- accessdate=31 December 2009 --&gt;|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110728083247/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/wahhabism-a-deadly-scripture-398516.html|archivedate=28 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic radicalisation==
Upon his release from prison in 1995,&lt;ref name="guardian 02-28-02"/&gt; he joined the [[Brixton Mosque]].&lt;ref name="time 01-14-02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1729022.stm|title=Shoe bomb suspect 'one of many'|date=26 December 2001|publisher=BBC News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111225445/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1729022.stm|archivedate=11 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later began attending the [[North London Central Mosque|Finsbury Park Mosque]] in North London, headed at that time by the anti-American cleric [[Abu Hamza al-Masri]] and described as "the heart of the extremist Islamic culture" in Britain.&lt;ref name="time 02-12-02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time 01-14-02"/&gt; By 1998 Reid was voicing extremist views.&lt;ref name="time 02-12-02"/&gt; At the Finsbury Park Mosque he fell under the sway of "terrorist talent spotters and handlers" allied with al-Qaeda, including  Djamal Beghal, one of the leaders of the foiled [[2001 attack U.S. Embassy Paris plot|plan for a 2001 suicide bombing of the American Embassy in Paris]].&lt;ref name="time 01-14-02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RaynerBeghal"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rayner|first1=Gordon|title=Charlie Hebdo suspect 'mentored' by Abu Hamza disciple, Djamal Beghal|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11333776/Charlie-Hebdo-suspect-mentored-by-Abu-Hamza-disciple.html|accessdate=13 December 2017|publisher=Telegraph|date=8 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225231828/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11333776/Charlie-Hebdo-suspect-mentored-by-Abu-Hamza-disciple.html|archivedate=25 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent 1999 and 2000 in Pakistan and trained at a terrorist camp in Afghanistan, according to several informants.&lt;ref name="time 02-12-02"/&gt; He may also have attended an anti-American religious training centre in [[Lahore]] as a follower of [[Mubarak Ali Gilani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bomb Probe Eyes Pakistan Links|url=http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/006/nation/Bomb_probe_eyes_Pakistan_links+.shtml |last=Stockman |first=Farah |date=6 January 2002 |work=Boston Globe|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020204163044/http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/006/nation/Bomb_probe_eyes_Pakistan_links+.shtml|archivedate=4 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his return to Britain, Reid worked to obtain duplicate [[passport]]s from British government consulates abroad. He lived and travelled in several places in Europe, communicating via an address in [[Peshawar]], Pakistan.&lt;ref name="time 02-12-02"/&gt; In July 2001, Reid flew to Israel.&lt;ref name="time 01-14-02"/&gt;

==Preparation for bombing==
Reid and [[Saajid Badat]], another British man preparing as a terrorist, returned to Pakistan in November 2001, and reportedly travelled overland to Afghanistan. They were given "shoe bombs", casual footwear adapted to be covertly smuggled onto aircraft before being used to destroy them. Later [[forensic analysis]] of both bombs showed that they contained the same [[plastic explosive]] and that the respective lengths of [[detonator cord]] had come from the same batch: the cut mark on Badat's cord exactly matched that on Reid's. The pair returned separately to the United Kingdom in early December 2001. Reid went to Belgium for 10 days before catching a train to Paris on 16 December.&lt;ref name="CNN 12-28-01"/&gt;

On 21 December 2001, Reid attempted to board a flight from [[Paris]] to [[Miami, Florida]]. His boarding was delayed because his dishevelled physical appearance aroused the suspicions of the airline passenger screeners. In addition, Reid did not answer all of their questions, and had not checked any luggage for the transatlantic flight. Additional screening by the [[French National Police]] resulted in Reid's being re-issued a ticket for a flight on the following day.&lt;ref name="cnn 12-25-01"/&gt; He returned to the Paris airport on 22 December 2001, and boarded [[American Airlines]] Flight 63 from Paris to Miami, wearing his special shoes packed with plastic explosives in their hollowed-out bottoms.

==Bombing attempt on American Airlines Flight 63==
{{Main|2001 shoe bomb attempt}}
[[File:Richard Reid explosive shoe.jpg|thumb|left|One of Reid's shoes]]
On 22 December 2001, a passenger on Flight 63 from Paris to Miami complained of a smoke smell in the cabin shortly after a meal service. One flight attendant, Hermis Moutardier, thinking she smelled a burnt match, walked along the aisles of the plane, trying to assess the source. A passenger pointed to Reid, who was sitting alone near a window and attempting to light a match. Moutardier warned him that smoking was not allowed on the airplane. Reid promised to stop.

A few minutes later, Moutardier found Reid leaned over in his seat. Her attempts to get his attention failed. After asking "What are you doing?" Reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse which led into the shoe, and a lit match. She tried grabbing Reid twice, but he pushed her to the floor each time, and she yelled for help, and ran to get water. When another flight attendant, Cristina Jones, arrived to try to subdue him, he fought her, biting her thumb, and Moutardier threw water in his face. Several passengers worked together to subdue the 6 foot 4&amp;nbsp;inch (193&amp;nbsp;cm) tall, 200+ pound (90+ kg) Reid. They restrained him using plastic handcuffs, seatbelt extensions, leather waist belts and headphone cords. A doctor on board administered a [[tranquilizer]] to him which he found in the emergency medical kit of the airliner.&lt;ref name="time 09-01-02"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101020909/aattendants.html|title=11 Lives&amp;nbsp;— The Flight Attendants|last=Thomas|first=Cathy Booth|date=1 September 2002|work=Time&lt;!-- accessdate=31 December 2009 --&gt;|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522191115/http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101020909/aattendants.html|archivedate=22 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flight was immediately diverted to [[Logan International Airport]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, the closest US airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/FeaturedDocs/U.S._v_Reid_Complaint.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301162226/http://nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/FeaturedDocs/U.S._v_Reid_Complaint.pdf |archivedate=1 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explosive apparently did not detonate due to the delay in the take-off of Reid's flight. The rainy weather, perhaps along with Reid's foot perspiration, caused the fuse to be too damp to ignite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.opensourcesinfo.org/journal/2005/7/25/terrorist-use-of-tatp-explosive.html |title=Terrorist Use Of TATP Explosive |publisher=Opensourcesinfo.org |date=25 July 2005 |accessdate=18 January 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717041411/http://www.opensourcesinfo.org/journal/2005/7/25/terrorist-use-of-tatp-explosive.html |archivedate=17 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings and sentencing==
[[File:Florence ADMAX.jpg|thumb|Reid is incarcerated at [[USP Florence ADMAX]], pictured here]]
Reid was immediately arrested at Logan International Airport after the incident. Two days later, he was charged before a [[United States Federal courts|federal court]] in Boston with "interfering with the performance of duties of flight crew members by assault or intimidation", a crime which carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. (Additional charges were added when he was formally [[indicted]] by a [[grand jury]].) The judge ordered Reid held in jail without [[bail]], pending trial due to the gravity of the crimes and the perceived high risk that he would try to flee.&lt;ref name="cnn 12-25-01"&gt;{{cite news|title=Shoe bomb suspect to remain in custody|url=http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/12/24/investigation.plane/|accessdate=31 December 2009|work=CNN|date=25 December 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020404125657/http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/12/24/investigation.plane/|archivedate=4 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials at the time indicated that Reid's shoes contained 10 ounces (283 g) of explosive material characteristic of [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]]—enough to blow a hole in the fuselage and cause the plane to crash.&lt;ref name="cnn 12-25-01"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Pierre|last2=Pinto|first2=Barbara|last3=Stark|first3=Lisa|last4=Wright|first4=David|title=Shoe Bomb Suspect Had Enough Explosives to Bring Down Plane|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=92054|accessdate=9 December 2014|work=ABC News|date=24 December 2001|quote=Officials at Logan Airport described the substance as consistent with the military plastic explosive C-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a preliminary hearing on 28 December, an FBI agent testified that forensic analysis had identified the chemicals as [[PETN]], the primary explosive, and [[TATP]] (triacetone triperoxide), a chemical needed to detonate the bomb with a fuse and match.&lt;ref name="CNN 12-28-01"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reeve|first1=Simon|title=Shoe-bomb flight -- a trial run? / U.S., British officials fear similar attacks in the works|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Shoe-bomb-flight-a-trial-run-U-S-British-2885291.php|accessdate=9 December 2014|work=SFGate|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=6 January 2002|quote=The TATP in Reid's shoes was "blended" with an explosive called PETN, or pentaerythritol tetranitrate, which can be ignited with a normal cigarette lighter.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910193610/http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Shoe-bomb-flight-a-trial-run-U-S-British-2885291.php|archivedate=10 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Candiotti|first1=Susan|title=Official: Plastic explosive 'very sophisticated'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/12/26/inv.reid.mosque/|accessdate=9 December 2014|work=CNN|date=27 December 2001|quote=Richard Reid hid 10 ounces of PETN-based material, a version of the plastic explosive C4 that is very sensitive to heat and friction|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017005328/http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/12/26/inv.reid.mosque/|archivedate=17 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor obtained a grand jury indictment and on 16 January 2002, Reid was charged with nine criminal counts related to [[terrorism]], namely:

*[[Attempted murder]],
*2 counts of interference with flight crew members and attendants on an aircraft
*Attempted destruction of an aircraft or public mass transportation vehicle

The ninth charge, attempted wrecking of a mass transportation vehicle, was dismissed on June 11, 2002, because the Congressional definition of 'vehicle' did not include aircraft.&lt;ref name="United States v.

During the sentencing hearing, Reid said he was an enemy of the United States and in league with [[al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;Reid's membership in al-Qaeda was corroborated later in 2003 by informant [[Mohammed Jabarah|Mohammed Mansour Jabarah]] during an interrogation at an American military base. Jabarah said Reid was a member of al-Qaeda who had trained in Afghanistan under the direction of [[Khalid Shaikh Mohammed]] {{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/southeast/01/30/reid.alqaeda/|title=Sources:Reid is al Qaeda operative|last=Ressa|first=Maria|date=6 December 2003|publisher=CNN&lt;!-- accessdate=31 December 2009 --&gt;|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104171205/http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/southeast/01/30/reid.alqaeda/|archivedate=4 January 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Reid said he was a soldier of [[God in Islam|God]] under the command of Osama bin Laden, Judge Young responded: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"You are not an enemy combatant, you are a terrorist" ... "You are not a soldier in any army, you are a terrorist. To call you a soldier gives you far too much stature.

==Conspirators==
{{Main|Saajid Badat}}
Although Reid had insisted that he had acted alone and had built the bombs himself, forensic evidence included material from another person.&lt;ref name="nytimes 01-31-03"/&gt; In 2005, a British man, [[Saajid Badat]] from [[Gloucester]], England, admitted that he had conspired with Richard Reid and a [[Tunisia]]n man ([[Nizar Trabelsi]], who is in jail in [[Belgium]]), in a plot to blow up two airliners bound for the United States, using their shoe bombs.&lt;ref name="times on line"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article384323.ece|title=Gloucester shoebomber jailed for 13 more-or-less simultaneouslyyears|last=Booth|first=Jenny|date=22 April 2005|publisher=Times Online|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005227/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article384323.ece|archivedate=4 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badat has said that he had been instructed to board a flight from [[Amsterdam]] to the United States. Badat never boarded and withdrew from his part of the conspiracy. Badat did not warn criminal or aviation authorities about Reid.

As a result of these events, airlines required passengers departing from an airport in the United States to pass through airport security in socks or [[bare feet]] while their shoes are scanned for bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/national/130541_shoes12.html |title=No small feat, tightening up shoe inspections |last=Gathright |first=Alan |date=12 July 2003 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |&lt;!-- accessdate=31 December 2009 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scanners do not find [[PETN]] in shoes or strapped to a person.

==Alleged role in September 11 attacks==
Captured [[al-Qaeda]] terrorist conspirator [[Zacarias Moussaoui]], stated at his sentencing hearing in 2006 that Reid was a co-conspirator in the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001, terrorist attacks]] on the United States, and that Moussaoui and Reid had intended to [[airplane hijacking|hijack]] a fifth aircraft and crash it into the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], as part of the attacks that took place that day. [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] investigators and the federal prosecutors were skeptical of Moussaoui's claim that Reid was involved in the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/21/us/21moussaoui.html?_r=1 |last=Lewis |first=Neil A. |title=Prosecutors Concede Doubts About Moussaoui's Story |date=21 April 2006 |work=New York Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702233516/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/21/us/21moussaoui.html?_r=1 |archivedate=2 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prison restrictions==
Reid filed a lawsuit against the restrictions placed on him in prison which controlled his communications with lawyers and other non-prisoners, limited his access to Muslim clerics, and prevented him from joining in group prayer at the prison. In 2009, Reid went on a [[hunger strike]] and was [[forced-feeding|force-fed]] and hydrated for several weeks. It was unknown whether Reid's hunger strike was related to his lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.BBC.co.uk/2/hi/Americas/8094727.stm |title='Shoe bomber' is on hunger strike |date=11 June 2009 |publisher=BBC News &lt;!-- accessdate=31 December 2009 --&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615181726/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8094727.stm |archivedate=15 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], after consulting with its Counterterrorism Section, the prosecuting US Attorney's office, and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], allowed these prison restrictions on Reid to expire{{clarify|date=October 2011}} during 2009, making his lawsuit moot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/09/22/reid.mailprivileges/ |title=Experts wary of 'shoe bomber' communication with family |last=McConnell |first=Dugald |date=22 September 2009 |publisher=CNN &lt;!-- accessdate=31 December 2009 --&gt; |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107045744/http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/09/22/reid.mailprivileges/ |archivedate=7 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Savoy Theatre''' is a [[West End theatre]] in the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in the [[City of Westminster]], London, England. The theatre opened on 10 October 1881 and was built by [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] on the site of the old [[Savoy Palace]] as a showcase for the popular series of [[comic opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], which became known as the [[Savoy opera]]s as a result.

The theatre was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electricity. For many years, the Savoy Theatre was the home of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]], which continued to be run by the Carte family for over a century. Richard's son [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]] rebuilt and modernised the theatre in 1929, and it was rebuilt again in 1993 following a fire. It is a Grade II* [[listed building]].

In addition to ''[[The Mikado]]'' and other famous Gilbert and Sullivan premières, the theatre has hosted such premières as the first public performance in England of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'' (1931) and [[Noël Coward]]'s ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'' (1941). In recent years it has presented opera, [[Shakespeare]] and other non-musical plays, and [[musical theatre|musicals]].

==History of the site==
The [[House of Savoy]] was the ruling family of [[Savoy]] descended from [[Humbert I, Count of Savoy|Humbert I, Count of Sabaudia]] (or "Maurienne"), who became count in 1032. The name Sabaudia evolved into "Savoy" (or "Savoie"). [[Peter II, Count of Savoy|Count Peter]] (or ''Piers'' or ''Piero'') of Savoy (d. 1268) was the maternal uncle of [[Eleanor of Provence]], queen-consort of [[Henry III of England]], and came with her to London.&lt;ref name=bho/&gt;

[[Image:Savoy Palace.jpg|thumb|left|The Savoy Palace]]
King Henry made Peter [[Earl of Richmond]] and, in 1246, gave him the land between [[Strand, London|The Strand]] and the [[Thames]] where Peter built the Savoy Palace in 1263. On Peter's death, the Savoy was given to [[Edmund, 1st Earl of Lancaster]], by his mother, Queen Eleanor. Edmund's great-granddaughter, Blanche, inherited the site. Her husband, [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]], built a magnificent palace that was burned down by [[Wat Tyler]]'s followers in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381. King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] was still a child, and his uncle John of Gaunt was the power behind the throne and so a main target of the rebels.&lt;ref name=bho/&gt;

In about 1505 [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] planned a great hospital for "pouer, nedie people", leaving money and instructions for it in his will. The hospital was built in the palace ruins and was licensed in 1512. Drawings show that it was a magnificent building, with a dormitory, dining hall and three chapels. Henry VII's hospital lasted for two centuries but suffered from poor management. The sixteenth-century historian [[John Stow]] noted that the hospital was being misused by "loiterers, vagabonds and strumpets". In 1702 the hospital was dissolved, and the hospital buildings were used for other purposes. Part of the old palace was used for a military prison in the eighteenth century. In the nineteenth century, the old hospital buildings were demolished and new buildings erected.&lt;ref name=bho&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/old-new-london/vol3/pp95-100 "The Savoy"], British History Online, University of London, retrieved 15 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864 a fire burned everything except the stone walls and the [[Savoy Chapel]], and the property sat empty until [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] bought it in 1880 to build the Savoy Theatre specifically for the production of the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas that he was producing.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; The new theatre was built speedily, and accounts noted that it "was situated on a site which, though rich in historical associations, was also rich in the olfactory sense, Mr Rimmel's scent factory being close by as was Burgess's Noted Fish-Sauce Shop."&lt;ref name=bettany/&gt;

==Richard D'Oyly Carte's theatre==
[[File:Savoy pre-1920.JPG|right|thumb|Original interior of Savoy Theatre, 1881]]
Carte bought the freehold of the site, then known as "Beaufort Buildings", early in 1880 for £11,000, but had begun planning his theatre several years before. In 1877 he engaged [[Walter Emden]], an architect whose work includes the [[Garrick Theatre|Garrick]] and the [[Duke of York's Theatre|Duke of York's]] theatres.&lt;ref name=savoyard/&gt; Before completing the site purchase, city officials had assured Carte that they would open a new street on the south side of the plot, provided he paid half the cost. He paid his half in March 1880, but the officials caused lengthy delays. Carte told ''[[The Times]]'', "I am struggling in the meshes of red tape".&lt;ref&gt;Carte, Richard D'Oyly. "Building Difficulties", ''The Times'', 22 May 1880, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He finally received the necessary agreement in June. At the same time he ran into another obstacle: Emden suddenly revised his estimate of building costs upward from £12,000 to £18,000. Carte dismissed Emden, who successfully sued for £1,790 for services to date and £3,000 for wrongful dismissal.&lt;ref name=savoyard&gt;"100 Electrifying Years", ''The Savoyard'', Volume XX no. 2, D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust, September 1981, pp. 4–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Design of the theatre was given to [[Charles J. Phipps|C. J. Phipps]]. The builders were Patman and Fotheringham. Plans were drawn up and executed with speed and efficiency. Nonetheless, the advertised opening date had to be put back several times while the innovative electrical work was completed.&lt;ref name=savoyard/&gt; The Savoy finally opened on 10 October 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Carte had at one time intended to call it the Beaufort Theatre,&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;Howard, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; but he announced in a letter to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in 1881, "On the Savoy Manor there was formerly a theatre. I have used the ancient name as an appropriate title for the present one."&lt;ref name=savoyard/&gt; The exterior of the building was made from red brick and Portland stone.&lt;ref name="Oost, p. 59"&gt;Oost, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The interior decoration, by Collinson and Locke, was "in the manner of the [[Italian Renaissance]]", with white, pale yellow and gold predominating, including a gold satin curtain (instead of the usual printed act-drop), red boxes and dark blue seats.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; There were none of the cherubs, deities and mythical creatures familiar from the décor of rival theatres. Carte wanted nothing that would appear too garish or gaudy to his target, middle-class audience.&lt;ref name="Oost, p. 59"/&gt;

[[File:Savoycoatofarms.jpg|left|thumb|1896 programme with [[Savoy]] [[coat of arms]]]]
On the opening night Phipps took curtain calls along with [[W. S. Gilbert|Gilbert]], [[Arthur Sullivan|Sullivan]] and Carte.&lt;ref name=savoyard/&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' commented, "A perfect view of the stage can be had from every seat in the house."&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Exits on all four sides of the theatre were provided, and fireproof materials were used to ensure maximum safety.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;  There were three tiers with four levels: stalls and pit, balcony, circle, and amphitheatre and gallery at the top. The total [[seating capacity]] was 1,292.&lt;ref&gt;18 private boxes (72 seats); 150 stalls, 250 pit, 160 balcony, 160 circle, and 500 (maximum) amphitheatre and gallery. "The Savoy Theatre", ''The Times'', 3 October 1881&lt;/ref&gt; The [[proscenium]] arch was {{convert|30|ft|m}} high by {{convert|30|ft|m}} wide, and the stage was {{convert|27|ft|m}} deep from the proscenium to the back wall.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in the Theatre'', 1912, p. 297.  Chapple, p. 11, and Howard, p. 214, give the dimensions as 60 feet wide by 52 feet deep, but those measurements included the wing space and the scene dock at the rear.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre originally had its main entrance on the [[Thames Embankment|Embankment]]. The parcel on which it was built is steep, stretching from the Strand down to the Embankment along Beaufort Street. After Carte built the [[Savoy Hotel]] in 1889, the theatre entrance was moved to its present location at the hotel's courtyard off the Strand.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The Savoy was a state-of-the-art theatre and the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electricity.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;"The Savoy Theatre", ''[[The Times]]'', 3 October 1881&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;Burgess, Michael. "Richard D'Oyly Carte", ''The Savoyard'', January 1975, pp. 7–11&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, [[Sir Joseph Swan]], inventor of the [[incandescent light bulb]], supplied about 1,200 Swan incandescent lamps, and the lights were powered by a {{convert|120|hp|adj=on}} generator on open land near the theatre.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Tony. [http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/tale-tragedy-behind-triumphs-joseph-4424356 "Tale of tragedy behind the triumphs of Joseph Swan"], ''The Journal'', 28 September 2011, accessed 11 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Carte explained why he had introduced electric light: "The greatest drawbacks to the enjoyment of the theatrical performances are, undoubtedly, the foul air and heat which pervade all theatres. As everyone knows, each [[gas lighting|gas-burner]] consumes as much oxygen as many people, and causes great heat beside. The incandescent lamps consume no oxygen, and cause no perceptible heat."&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The first generator proved too small to power the whole building, and though the entire front-of-house was electrically lit, the stage was lit by gas until 28 December 1881. At that performance, Carte stepped onstage and broke a glowing lightbulb before the audience to demonstrate the safety of the new technology. ''The Times'' described the electric lighting as superior, visually, to gaslight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/carte/savoy/electric.html "Savoy Theatre"],  ''The Times'', 28 December 1881, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Gaslights were installed as a backup, but they rarely had to be used.&lt;ref name=savoyard/&gt; ''The Times'' concluded that the theatre "is admirably adapted for its purpose, its acoustic qualities are excellent, and all reasonable demands of comfort and taste are complied with."&lt;ref&gt;"The Savoy Theatre", ''The Times'', 11 October 1881&lt;/ref&gt; Carte and his manager, [[George Edwardes]] (later famous as manager of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]]), introduced several innovations including numbered seating, free programme booklets, good quality whisky in the bars, the "queue" system for the pit and gallery (an American idea) and a policy of no tipping for cloakroom or other services.&lt;ref name=bettany&gt;Bettany, unnumbered page (there are no page numbers in the book)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Daily expenses at the theatre were about half the possible takings from ticket sales.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dark and Grey, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1881 Patience.jpg|right|thumb|upright|1881 Programme for ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'']]
The work that opened the new theatre was Gilbert and Sullivan's [[comic opera]] ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', which had been running since April 1881 at the smaller [[Opera Comique]].&lt;ref name=bettany/&gt; The last eight of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas were premièred at the Savoy: ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1882), ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885), ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887), ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888) ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889), ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' (1893), and ''[[The Grand Duke]]'' (1896), and the term [[Savoy opera]] has come to be associated with all their joint works. After the end of the Gilbert and Sullivan partnership, Carte, and later his widow, [[Helen Carte|Helen]] (and her manager from 1901–1903, [[William Greet]]), staged other comic operas at the theatre by [[Arthur Sullivan]] and others, notably [[Ivan Caryll]], [[Sydney Grundy]], [[Basil Hood]] and [[Edward German]].&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 16–19&lt;/ref&gt;  The Savoy Operas of the 1890s, however, were far less successful than those of the Gilbert and Sullivan heyday. After Carte's production of ''[[The Chieftain]]'' ended in March 1895, the Theatre briefly hosted the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] and then closed until late 1895, when Carte resumed productions at the theatre. Sullivan died in 1900, and Richard D'Oyly Carte died in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

The Savoy Theatre closed in 1903, and was reopened under the management of John Leigh and [[Edward Laurillard]] from February 1904 (beginning with a musical, ''The Love Birds'') to December 1906.&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt; The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company returned to the Savoy for repertory seasons between 1906 and 1909, in which year [[C. H. Workman]] took over the management of the theatre. He produced, among other works, Gilbert's final opera, with music by German, ''[[Fallen Fairies]]'' in 1909–10, which ran for only 51 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; He also produced ''[[Two Merry Monarchs]]'' and ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice|Orpheus and Eurydice]]'' in 1910, the latter of which starred [[Marie Brema]] and [[Viola Tree]] in the title roles.&lt;ref&gt;Wearing, vol. 1, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company did not play in the theatre from 1909 until 1929,&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 22–154.&lt;/ref&gt; instead touring throughout Britain and playing London seasons in other theatres; other works held the stage of the Savoy. George Augustus Richardson managed the theatre from November 1911 to February 1915.&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt; ''The Mikado's'' record as the Savoy's longest-running production was broken by the comedy ''Paddy the Next Best Thing'', which played for 867 performances from April 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Gaye, p. 1536&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rupert D'Oyly Carte's theatre==
In 1915 Richard D'Oyly Carte's son, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]], took over management of the theatre.&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt; After serving in the navy in World War I, Carte decided to bring the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company back to London in first-rate style. He began to mount seasons of updated and refreshed Gilbert and Sullivan productions at first at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre|Prince's Theatre]] in 1919.&lt;ref name=bettany/&gt; [[J. B.

On 3 June 1929 Carte closed the Savoy Theatre, and the interior was completely rebuilt to designs by Frank A. Tugwell with elaborate décor by [[Basil Ionides]]. The ceiling was painted to resemble an April sky; the walls, translucent gold on silver; the rows of stalls were all richly upholstered in different colours, and the curtain repeated the tones of the seating. Ionides said that he took the colour scheme from a bed of zinnias in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].&lt;ref name=bettany/&gt; The entire floor space had been replanned: the old cloakrooms and bar at the back of the theatre were relocated to the side, and instead of 18 boxes there was now only one. The new auditorium had two tiers leaving three levels: stalls, dress, and upper circle. The capacity of the old house, originally 1,292, had been reduced to 986 by 1912,&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in the Theatre'', 1912, p. 297. The seating plan in that edition shows only 8 boxes instead of the original 18, and reduced numbers of seats in the Dress (156) and Upper Circle (127) (as they were by then named).&lt;/ref&gt; and the new theatre restored the capacity almost completely, with 1,200 seats.&lt;ref&gt;"Reopening of the Savoy", ''The Times'', 21 October 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; The new stage was 29.3 feet wide, by 29.5 feet deep.&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt;

The theatre reopened on 21 October 1929 with a new production of ''The Gondoliers'' designed by [[Charles Ricketts]] and conducted by [[Malcolm Sargent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/carte/1929/index.html Rupert D'Oyly Carte's 1929–30 Season at the G&amp;S Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; In the only box sat Lady Gilbert, the librettist's widow.&lt;ref name=bettany/&gt; There were Gilbert and Sullivan seasons at the Savoy Theatre in 1929–30, 1932–33, 1951, 1954, 1961–62, 1975, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003. Other famous works presented at the Savoy included the première of [[Noël Coward]]'s ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'' (1941, which ran 1,997 consecutive performances, setting a new record for non-musical theatre runs), [[Robert Morley]] in ''[[The Man Who Came to Dinner]]'', and several comedies by [[William Douglas-Home]] starring, among others, [[Ralph Richardson]], [[Peggy Ashcroft]], and [[John Mills]]. The long-delayed first public performance in England of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'' played at the theatre in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Samantha.

After Rupert D'Oyly Carte died in 1948 his daughter, [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]], succeeded to the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and became a director and later president of the Savoy Hotel group, which controlled the theatre. Management of the theatre was assumed in 1948 by [[Hugh Wontner|Sir Hugh Wontner]], chairman of the Savoy hotel group.&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt; The theatre was designated a Grade II* [[listed building]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{IoE|427797|Grade II*|accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company closed in 1982, and Dame Bridget died childless in 1985, bringing the family line to an end. Wontner continued as chairman of the theatre until his death in 1992.&lt;ref name=times&gt;''The Times'', obituary of Hugh Wontner, 27 November 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990 fire and restored theatre==
[[File:Savoy Theatre.jpg|thumb|alt=Savoy theatre refurbishment.|upright|left|The Savoy Theatre was refurbished in the early 1990s.]]
While the theatre was being renovated in February 1990, a fire gutted the building, except for the stage and backstage areas. A proposal to build a new theatre in late 20th-century style was overruled by the Savoy's insurers and by English Heritage, the government body with oversight of listed buildings. It was decided to restore the building as faithfully as possible to the 1929 designs.&lt;ref name=gala&gt;Young, John. "Royal gala marks rebirth of D'Oyly Carte's theatre". ''The Times'', 20 July 1993, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Tugwell's and Ionides's working designs had been preserved, allowing accurate restoration of the theatre under the direction of the architect Sir William Whitfield, Sir Hugh Wontner and the theatre's manager, Kevin Chapple.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/obituaries/2008/kevin-chapple/ Kevin Chapple obituary,] ''The Stage'', 8 January 2008, accessed 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It reopened on 19 July 1993, with a royal gala that included a specially commissioned ballet, ''Savoy Suite'', by [[Wayne Sleep]] to a score based on Sullivan's music.&lt;ref&gt;Church, Michael.

During the renovation, an extra storey was added above the theatre that includes a health club for the hotel and a swimming pool above the stage. The reopened theatre was the venue for the [[World Chess Championship]] in 1993, won by [[Garry Kasparov]].&lt;ref&gt;Keene, Raymond and Ian Murray. "Kasparov clinches world title after Short accepts draw", ''The Times'', 20 October 1993, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 Noël Coward's ''[[Relative Values (play)|Relative Values]]'', played at the theatre, having premièred there in 1951, an original run of 477 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Gaye, p. 1537&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[Travesties]]'', with [[Antony Sher]] was next, and in 1994 the musical ''[[She Loves Me]]'' played, with [[Ruthie Henshall]] and [[John Gordon Sinclair]]. These were followed by [[Terry Johnson (dramatist)|Terry Johnson]]'s ''Dead Funny''; [[Alan Ayckbourn]]'s ''[[Communicating Doors]]'' (which transferred to the theatre in 1996), with [[Angela Thorne]]; [[J. B. Priestley]]'s ''When We Are Married'', with [[Dawn French]], [[Alison Steadman]], and [[Leo McKern]]; and [[Ben Travers]]' ''Plunder'', with [[Griff Rhys Jones]] and [[Kevin McNally]]. In 1997 a group led by [[Stephen Waley-Cohen|Sir Stephen Waley-Cohen]] was given management of the theatre by The Savoy Group. Productions that followed included [[Simon Callow]] in ''[[The Importance of Being Oscar]]''; [[Pet Shop Boys]] in concert; [[Ian Richardson]] in [[Arthur Wing Pinero|Pinero]]'s ''The Magistrate''; [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] in ''A Letter of Resignation''; the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s production of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', with [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]]; and Coward's ''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'', with [[Geraldine McEwan]] in 1999.

In 2000 the briefly reconstituted D'Oyly Carte Opera Company produced ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' at the theatre. [[Donald Sutherland]] then starred in ''Enigmatic Variations'', followed by a second D'Oyly Carte season, playing ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]''.&lt;ref name=Ambass&gt;[http://www.atgtickets.com/information.aspx?cat=aboutus&amp;Vid=674&amp;regionID=5 Information from the Ambassador Theatre Group's website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, a season of ''[[Return to the Forbidden Planet]]'' was followed by the D'Oyly Carte productions of ''[[Iolanthe]]'', ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' and ''[[The Mikado]]'', and then a revival of [[Yasmina Reza]]'s ''Life x 3''. In 2003, the company revived ''Pinafore'', followed by ''[[Bea Arthur]] at The Savoy'', [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''Of Mice and Men'', ''Peter Pan'' and ''Pirates''. These were followed by ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' and ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' performed by The Savoy Opera Company in 2004. Next were seasons of [[Lorna Luft]] starring in ''Songs My Mother Taught Me'' and the new salsa musical ''Murderous Instincts''. Coward's ''Blithe Spirit'' was revived in 2004–05.&lt;ref name=Ambass/&gt;

The Savoy Hotel group, including the theatre, was sold in 2004 to Quinlan Private which, in turn, sold the theatre in 2005 to the Ambassador Theatre Group (ATG) and the Tulbart Group (selling the Savoy Hotel to Prince [[Al-Waleed bin Talal]]).&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Dominic.

{{Campaignbox Greco-Persian Wars}}
{{Campaignbox Second Persian invasion of Greece}}

The '''second [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] invasion of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]''' (480–479 BC) occurred during the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], as King [[Xerxes I]] of Persia sought to conquer all of Greece. The invasion was a direct, if delayed, response to the defeat of the [[first Persian invasion of Greece]] (492–490 BC) at the [[Battle of Marathon]], which ended [[Darius I]]'s attempts to subjugate Greece. After Darius's death, his son Xerxes spent several years planning for the second invasion, mustering an enormous army and navy. The [[History of Athens|Athenians]] and [[Sparta]]ns led the Greek resistance. About a tenth of the Greek city-states joined the 'Allied' effort; most remained neutral or submitted to Xerxes.

The invasion began in spring 480 BC, when the Persian army crossed the [[Hellespont]] and marched through [[Thrace]] and [[Macedon]] to [[Thessaly]]. The Persian advance was blocked at the pass of [[Thermopylae]] by a small Allied force under King [[Leonidas I]] of Sparta; simultaneously, the Persian fleet was blocked by an Allied fleet at the straits of [[Artemisium]]. At the famous [[Battle of Thermopylae]], the Allied army held back the Persian army for three days, before they were outflanked by a mountain path and the Allied rearguard was trapped and annihilated. The Allied fleet had also withstood two days of Persian attacks at the [[Battle of Artemisium]], but when news reached them of the disaster at Thermopylae, they withdrew to [[Salamis Island|Salamis]].

After Thermopylae, all of [[Euboea]], [[Phocis]], [[Boeotia]] and [[Attica]] fell to the Persian army, which captured and burnt [[Athens]]. However, a larger Allied army fortified the narrow [[Isthmus of Corinth]], protecting the [[Peloponnesus]] from Persian conquest. Both sides thus sought a naval victory that might decisively alter the course of the war. The Athenian general [[Themistocles]] succeeded in luring the Persian navy into the narrow Straits of Salamis, where the huge number of Persian ships became disorganised, and were soundly beaten by the Allied fleet. The Allied [[Battle of Salamis|victory at Salamis]] prevented a quick conclusion to the invasion, and fearing becoming trapped in Europe, Xerxes retreated to Asia leaving his general [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] to finish the conquest with the elite of the army.

The following spring, the Allies assembled the largest ever [[hoplite]] army, and marched north from the isthmus to confront Mardonius. At the ensuing [[Battle of Plataea]], the Greek infantry again proved its superiority, inflicting a severe defeat on the Persians and killing Mardonius in the process. On the same day, across the [[Aegean Sea]] an Allied navy destroyed the remnants of the Persian navy at the [[Battle of Mycale]]. With this double defeat, the invasion was ended, and Persian power in the Aegean severely dented. The Greeks would now move to the [[Greco-Persian Wars#Greek counterattack (479–478 BC)|offensive]], eventually expelling the Persians from Europe, the Aegean islands and Ionia before the war finally came to an end in 479 BC.

==Sources==
{{Main|Herodotus}}

The main source for the Great Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]]. Herodotus, who has been called the 'Father of History',&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De Legibus|On the Laws]]'' I, 5&lt;/ref&gt; was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek&amp;mdash;''Historia''; English&amp;mdash;''[[Histories (Herodotus)|(The) Histories]]'') around 440&amp;ndash;430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC).&lt;ref name = hxvi/&gt; Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it.&lt;ref name = hxvi/&gt; As Holland has it: "For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally."&lt;ref name = hxvi&gt;Holland, pp. ''xvi''&amp;ndash;''xvii''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with [[Thucydides]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, e.g. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.22 I, 22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Fin15&gt;Finley, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the [[Siege of Sestos]]), and therefore evidently felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.&lt;ref name = Fin15/&gt; [[Plutarch]] criticised Herodotus in his essay "On The Malignity of Herodotus", describing Herodotus as "''Philobarbaros''" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. ''xxiv''.&lt;/ref&gt; A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=2008-01-18|author=David Pipes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071227170138/http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm |archivedate = December 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds that have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.&lt;ref name = h377&gt;Holland, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his ''Historia'', but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism.&lt;ref name = h377/&gt; Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.&lt;ref&gt;Fehling, pp. 1&amp;ndash;277.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] from Sicily, writing in the 1st century BC in his ''[[Bibliotheca historica|Bibliotheca Historica]]'', also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian [[Ephorus]]. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084&amp;layout=&amp;loc=11.28 Bibliotheca Historica], XI, 28&amp;ndash;34&lt;/ref&gt; The Greco-Persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, [[Ctesias]], and are alluded by other authors, such as the playwright [[Aeschylus]]. Archaeological evidence, such as the [[Serpent Column]], also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.&lt;ref&gt;Note to Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=9.81.1 IX, 81]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Greco-Persian Wars|First Persian invasion of Greece}}

The Greek city-states of Athens and [[Eretria]] had supported the unsuccessful [[Ionian Revolt]] against the Persian Empire of [[Darius I]] in 499–494 BC. The Persian Empire was still relatively young, and prone to revolts among its subject peoples.&lt;ref name = h47&gt;Holland, p. 47&amp;ndash;55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="h203"/&gt; Moreover, Darius was a usurper, and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.&lt;ref name = h47/&gt; The Ionian revolt threatened the integrity of his empire, and Darius thus vowed to punish those involved (especially those not already part of the empire).&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.105 V, 105]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = h171/&gt; Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece.&lt;ref name = h171&gt;Holland, 171&amp;ndash;178&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary expedition under Mardonius, in 492 BC, to secure the land approaches to Greece ended with the re-conquest of [[Thrace]] and forced [[Macedon]] to become a fully subordinate kingdom part of Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;layout=;query=chapter%3D%23946;loc=6.43.1 VI, 44]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|pp=135-138, 342-345}} It had previously been a vassal as early as the late 6th century BC, but remained having autonomy and not fully subordinate yet.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|pp=135-138, 342-345}}

[[File:Map Greco-Persian Wars-en.svg|thumb|right|300px|A map showing the Greek world at the time of the invasion]]

In 491 BC, Darius sent emissaries to all the Greek city-states, asking for a gift of '[[earth and water]]' in token of their submission to him.&lt;ref name = "h178"&gt;Holland, pp. 178&amp;ndash;179&lt;/ref&gt; Having had a demonstration of his power the previous year, the majority of Greek cities duly obliged. In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a well.&lt;ref name = "h178"/&gt; This meant that Sparta was also now effectively at war with Persia.&lt;ref name = "h178"/&gt;

Darius thus put together an ambitious task force under [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|Artaphernes]] in 490 BC, which attacked [[Naxos Island|Naxos]], before receiving the submission of the other [[Cyclades|Cycladic Islands]]. The task force then moved on Eretria, which it besieged and destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231007;layout=;loc=6.100.1 VI, 101]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it moved to attack Athens, landing at the bay of [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]], where it was met by a heavily outnumbered Athenian army. At the ensuing Battle of Marathon, the Athenians won a remarkable victory, which resulted in the withdrawal of the Persian army to Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.113 VI, 113]&lt;/ref&gt;

Darius therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition.&lt;ref name = h203&gt;Holland, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Darius then died while preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son [[Xerxes I]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp. 206&amp;ndash;207&lt;/ref&gt; Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece.&lt;ref name = h208&gt;Holland, pp. 208&amp;ndash;211&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persian preparations==
Since this was to be a full-scale invasion, it required long-term planning, stock-piling and conscription.&lt;ref name = h208/&gt; It was decided that [[Xerxes' Pontoon Bridges]] were to be set up to allow his army to cross the [[Hellespont]] to Europe, and that [[Xerxes Canal|a canal]] should be dug across the isthmus of [[Mount Athos]] (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC).&lt;ref name = h213/&gt; These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any contemporary state.&lt;ref name = h213&gt;Holland, pp. 213&amp;ndash;214&lt;/ref&gt; However, the campaign was delayed one year because of another revolt in Egypt and [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.7 VII, 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 481 BC, after roughly four years of preparation, Xerxes began to muster the troops for the invasion of Europe. Herodotus gives the names of 46 nations from which troops were drafted.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.62.1 VII, 62–80]&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian army was gathered in [[Asia Minor]] in the summer and autumn of 481 BC. The armies from the Eastern satrapies was gathered in [[Kritala]], [[Cappadocia]] and were led by Xerxes to [[Sardis]] where they passed the winter.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.26 VII, 26]&lt;/ref&gt; Early in spring it moved to [[Abydos, Hellespont|Abydos]] where it was joined with the armies of the western satrapies.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.37 VII, 37]&lt;/ref&gt; Then the army that Xerxes had mustered marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two [[pontoon bridge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231100;layout=;loc=7.35.1 VII, 35]&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers of troops that Xerxes mustered for the second invasion of Greece have been the subject of endless dispute, because the numbers given in ancient sources are very large indeed. Herodotus claimed that there were, in total, 2.5 million military personnel, accompanied by an equivalent number of support personnel.&lt;ref name="VII, 186"/&gt; The poet [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]], who was a contemporary, talks of four million; [[Ctesias]], based on Persian records, gave 800,000 as the total number of the army (without the support personnel) that was assembled by Xerxes.&lt;ref name = ctes&gt;Ctesias, [http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/ctesias/photius_persica2.html Persica]&lt;/ref&gt; While it has been suggested that Herodotus or his sources had access to official Persian Empire records of the forces involved in the expedition, modern scholars tend to reject these figures based on knowledge of the Persian military systems, their logistical capabilities, the Greek countryside, and supplies available along the army's route.&lt;ref name=souza/&gt;

Modern scholars thus generally attribute the numbers given in the ancient sources to the result of miscalculations or exaggerations on the part of the victors, or disinformation by the Persians in the run up to the war.&lt;ref name = h237/&gt; The topic has been hotly debated but the modern consensus revolves around the figure of 300,000&amp;ndash;500,000.&lt;ref name=souza/&gt;&lt;ref name = h237/&gt; Nevertheless, whatever the real numbers were, it is clear that Xerxes was eager to ensure a successful expedition by mustering overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea,&lt;ref name=souza/&gt; and also that much of the army died of starvation and disease, never returning to Asia.&lt;ref name = VIII115&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.115.1 VIII, 115]&lt;/ref&gt;

Herodotus tells us that the army and navy, while moving through Thrace, was halted at [[Doriskos]] for an inspection by Xerxes, and he recounts the numbers of troops found to be present:&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231123;layout=;loc=7.60.1 VII, 59]&lt;/ref&gt;

Herodotus doubles this number to account for support personnel and thus he reports that the whole army numbered 5,283,220 men.&lt;ref name="VII, 186"&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.186 VII, 186]&lt;/ref&gt; Other ancient sources give similarly large numbers.

[[File:Crossing the Hellespont by Xerxes with his huge army.gif|thumb|Crossing the Hellespont by Xerxes with his huge army]]
An early and very influential modern historian, [[George Grote]], set the tone by expressing incredulity at the numbers given by Herodotus: ''"To admit this overwhelming total, or anything near to it, is obviously impossible."''&lt;ref name = grote&gt;Grote, ch. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Grote's main objection is the supply problem, though he does not analyse the problem in detail. He did not reject Herodotus's account altogether, citing the latter's reporting of the Persians' careful methods of accounting and their stockpiling of supply caches for three years, but drew attention to the contradictions in the ancient sources.&lt;ref name = grote/&gt; A later influential historian, J. B. Bury, calls Herodotus's numbers "wholly fabulous" and judges that the Persian land forces may have been 180,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A history of Greece to the death of Alexander the Great 3rd edition|last=Bury|first=J. B.|publisher=Oxford Uni|year=1956|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A major limiting factor for the size of the Persian army, first suggested by Sir Frederick Maurice (a British transport officer) is the supply of water.&lt;ref name = Mau&gt;Maurice (1930)&lt;/ref&gt; Maurice suggested in the region of 200,000 men and 70,000 animals could have been supported by the rivers in that region of Greece. He further suggested that Herodotus may have confused the Persian terms for [[chiliarchy]] (1,000) and myriarchy (10,000), leading to an exaggeration by a factor of ten.&lt;ref name = Mau/&gt; Other early modern scholars estimated that the land forces participating in the invasion at 100,000 soldiers or less, based on the logistical systems available to the Ancients.&lt;ref&gt;Delbrück (1920)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warry (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engels (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;Scott (1915)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Fischer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Tarn (1908)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Obst (1914)&lt;/ref&gt;

Munro and [[Reginald Walter Macan|Macan]] note Herodotus giving the names of six major commanders and 29 myriarchs (leaders of a [[baivabaram]], the basic unit of the Persian infantry, which numbered about 10,000-strong&lt;ref&gt;Papademetriou (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sekunda &amp; Chew (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;); this would give a land force of roughly 300,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;Munro (1929)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Other proponents of larger numbers suggest figures from 250,000 to 700,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The size of the Persian Army |url=http://www.metrum.org/perwars/persize.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E Istorika, 19 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fleet====
The size of the Persian fleet is also disputed, though perhaps less so.&lt;ref name = h394&gt;Holland, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; According to Herodotus the Persian fleet numbered 1,207 triremes and 3,000 transport and supply ships, including 50-oared galleys (''[[Galley#Penteconters|Penteconters]]'') (πεντηκοντήρ).&lt;ref name="VII, 97"&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.97 VII, 97]&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus gives a detailed breakdown of the Persian triremes:

{| class="wikitable"
!|Region!!Number &lt;br /&gt; of ships|!!Region!!Number &lt;br /&gt; of ships|!!Region!!Number &lt;br /&gt; of ships
|-
| [[Phoenicia]] &lt;br&gt; and [[Syria]] || 300 || [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] || 200 || [[Cyprus]] || 150
|-
| [[Cilicia]]  || 100 || [[Ionia]] || 100 || [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] || 100
|-
| [[Caria]] || 70 || [[Aeolis|Aeolia]] || 60 || [[Lycia]] || 50
|-
| [[Pamphylia]] || 30 || [[Dorians]] from &lt;br&gt; [[Asia Minor]]  || 30 || [[Cycladic Islands|Cyclades]] || 17
|-
|  ||  || || ||'''Total'''||'''1207'''
|}

Herodotus also records that this was the number at the Battle of Salamis, despite the losses earlier in storms off Sepia and Euboea, and at the battle of Artemisium. He claims that the losses were replenished with reinforcements, though he only records 120 triremes from the Greeks of Thrace and an unspecified number of ships from the Greek islands. [[Aeschylus]], who fought at Salamis, also claims that he faced 1,207 warships there, of which 1,000 were triremes and 207 fast ships.&lt;ref name = Aesch&gt;Aeschylus, ''The Persians''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] &lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084&amp;layout=&amp;loc=11.3 XI, 3]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lysias]]&lt;ref&gt;Lysias II, 27&lt;/ref&gt; independently claim there were 1,200 at Doriskos. The number of 1,207 (for the outset only) is also given by [[Ephorus]],&lt;ref&gt;Ephorus, Universal History&lt;/ref&gt; while his teacher [[Isocrates]] claims there were 1,300 at Doriskos and 1,200 at Salamis.&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates, Oration VII, 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates, Oration IV, 93&lt;/ref&gt; Ctesias gives another number, 1,000 ships,&lt;ref name = ctes/&gt; while [[Plato]], speaking in general terms refers to 1,000 ships and more.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Laws'' III, 699&lt;/ref&gt;

These numbers are (by ancient standards) consistent, and this could be interpreted that a number around 1,200 is correct. Among modern scholars some have accepted this number, although suggesting that the number must have been lower by the Battle of Salamis.&lt;ref&gt;Köster (1934)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = L93&gt;Lazenby, pp. 93&amp;ndash;94&lt;/ref&gt; Other recent works on the Persian Wars reject this number&amp;mdash;1,207 being seen as more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the [[Iliad]]&amp;mdash;and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.&lt;ref name = L93/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burn, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek preparations==
[[File:Vix crater hoplite circa 500 BCE.jpg|thumb|upright|Probable Spartan [[Hoplite]], [[Vix krater]], circa 500 BC.]]
The Athenians had been preparing for war with the Persians since the mid-480s BC, and in 482 BC the decision was taken, under the guidance of the politician Themistocles, to build a massive fleet of triremes that would be necessary for the Greeks to fight the Persians.&lt;ref name = "h217"&gt;Holland, p. 217&amp;ndash;223&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians did not have the man-power to fight on land and sea; therefore combatting the Persians would require an alliance of several Greek city states. In 481 BC Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water, but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.32.1 VII, 32]&lt;/ref&gt; Support thus began to coalesce around these two states.

===Hellenic alliance===
A congress of states met at [[Corinth]] in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of [[History of Greece|Greek city-states]] was formed.&lt;ref name="vii-145"&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.145.1 VII, 145]&lt;/ref&gt; This confederation had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation. Herodotus does not formulate an abstract name for the union but simply calls them "οἱ Ἕλληνες" (the Greeks) and "the Greeks who had sworn alliance" (Godley translation) or "the Greeks who had banded themselves together" (Rawlinson translation).&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.148.1 VII, 148]&lt;/ref&gt; Hereafter, they will be referred to as the 'Allies'. Sparta and Athens had a leading role in the congress but interests of all the states played a part in determining defensive strategy.&lt;ref name="vii-160"&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.161.1 VII, 161]&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about the internal workings of the congress or the discussions during its meetings. Only 70 of the approximately 700 Greek cities sent representatives. Nevertheless, this was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.&lt;ref name = h226&gt;Holland, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of other city-states remained more-or-less neutral, awaiting the outcome of the confrontation.&lt;ref name="Holland, p225"&gt;Holland, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] was a major absentee, and was suspected of being willing to aid the Persians once the invasion force arrived.&lt;ref name="Holland, p225"/&gt;&lt;ref name = h263&gt;Holland, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; Not all Thebans agreed with this policy, and 400 "loyalist" hoplites joined the Allied force at Thermopylae (at least according to one possible interpretation).&lt;ref name = h263/&gt; The most notable city actively siding with the Persians ("Medised") was [[Argos]], in the otherwise Spartan-dominated Peloponnese.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp. 246&amp;ndash;247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = h168&gt;Holland, pp. 168&amp;ndash;169&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Argives had been severely weakened in 494 BC, when a Spartan-force led by [[Cleomenes I]] had annihilated the Argive army in [[Battle of Sepeia]] and then massacred the fugitives.&lt;ref name = h168/&gt;

===Size of allied forces===
{{Further|Battle of Thermopylae|Battle of Artemisium|Battle of Salamis|Battle of Plataea|Battle of Mycale}}
The allies had no 'standing army', nor was there any requirement to form one; since they were fighting on home territory, they could muster armies as and when required. Different-sized allied forces thus appeared throughout the campaign. These numbers are discussed fully in the article for each battle.

==Spring 480 BC: Thrace, Macedonia and Thessaly==
Having crossed into Europe in April 480 BC, the Persian army began its march to Greece. Five major food depots had been set up along the path: at [[Leuke Akte|White Headland]] on the Thracian side of the Hellespont, at [[Tyrodiza]] in [[Marmara Ereğlisi|Perinthian]] territory, at [[Doriskos]] at the [[Evros River|Evros river]] estuary where the Asian army was linked up with the [[Balkan]] allies, at [[Eion]] on the [[Strymon River|Strymon river]], and at [[Therme]], modern-day [[Thessaloniki]]. There, food had been sent from Asia for several years in preparation for the campaign. Animals had been bought and fattened, while the local populations had, for several months, been ordered to grind the grains into flour.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.25 VII, 25]&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian army took roughly three months to travel unopposed from the Hellespont to Therme, a journey of about 600&amp;nbsp;km (360&amp;nbsp;mi). It paused at [[Doriskos]] where it was joined by the fleet. Xerxes reorganized the troops into tactical units replacing the national formations used earlier for the march.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.100 VII, 100]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allied 'congress' met again in the spring of 480 BC. A Thessalian delegation suggested that the allies could muster in the narrow [[Vale of Tempe]], on the borders of [[Thessaly]], and thereby block Xerxes's advance.&lt;ref name = "h248"&gt;Holland, 248&amp;ndash;249&lt;/ref&gt; A force of 10,000 Allies led by the Spartan [[polemarch]] Euenetus and Themistocles was thus despatched to the pass. However, once there, they were warned by [[Alexander I of Macedon]] that the vale could be bypassed by at least two other passes, and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelming; the Allies therefore retreated.&lt;ref name="VII173"&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.173.1 VII, 173]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont.&lt;ref name="VII173"/&gt; The abandonment of Tempe meant that all of Thessaly submitted to the Persians, as did many cities to the north of the pass of [[Thermopylae]] when it seemed help was not forthcoming.&lt;ref name="VII174"&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;layout=;query=chapter%3D%231238;loc=7.173.1 VII, 174]&lt;/ref&gt;

A second strategy was therefore suggested to the Allies by [[Themistocles]]. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) would require the army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of [[Thermopylae]]. This could easily be blocked by the Allies, despite the overwhelming number of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could block the straits of [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]]. This dual strategy was adopted by the congress.&lt;ref name = "h255"&gt;Holland pp. 255&amp;ndash;257&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while the women and children of Athens were evacuated ''en masse'' to the Peloponnesian city of [[Troezen]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231343;layout=;loc=8.39.1 VIII, 40]&lt;/ref&gt;

==August 480 BC: Thermopylae and Artemisium==
{{Main|Battle of Thermopylae|Battle of Artemisium}}
[[File:Battle of Thermopylae and movements to Salamis, 480 BC.gif|thumb|Battle of Thermopylae and movements to Salamis, 480 BC.]]
When the Allies received the news that Xerxes was clearing paths around [[Mount Olympus]], and thus intending to march towards Thermopylae, it was both the period of truce that accompanied the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic games]], and the Spartan festival of [[Carneia]], during both of which warfare was considered sacrilegious.&lt;ref name = h257&gt;Holland, pp 257&amp;ndash;259&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Spartans considered the threat so grave that they despatched their king [[Leonidas I]] with his personal bodyguard (the ''Hippeis'') of 300 men (in this case, the elite young soldiers in the Hippeis were replaced by veterans who already had sons).&lt;ref name = h257/&gt; Leonidas was supported by contingents from the Peloponnesian cities allied to Sparta, and other forces that were picked up ''en route'' to Thermopylae.&lt;ref name = h257/&gt; The Allies proceeded to occupy the pass, rebuilt the wall the [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocians]] had built at the narrowest point of the pass, and waited for Xerxes's arrival.&lt;ref name = h262&gt;Holland, pp. 262&amp;ndash;264&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thermopylae ancient coastline large.jpg|300px|left|thumb|The pass of Thermopylae in modern times]]

When the Persians arrived at Thermopylae in mid-August, they initially waited for three days for the Allies to disperse. When Xerxes was eventually persuaded that the Allies intended to contest the pass, he sent his troops to attack.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231274;layout=;loc=7.211.1 VII, 210]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Greek position was ideally suited to [[hoplite]] warfare, the Persian contingents being forced to attack the [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] head on.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies thus withstood two full days of battle and everything Xerxes could throw at them. However, at the end of the second day, they were betrayed by a local resident named [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]] who revealed to Xerxes a mountain path that led behind the Allied lines. Xerxes then sent his elite guards, the Immortals on a night march to outflank the Allied. When he was made aware of this maneuver (while the Immortals were still ''en route''), Leonidas dismissed the bulk of the Allied army, remaining to guard the rear with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebians and perhaps a few hundred others. On the third day of the battle, the remaining Allies sallied forth from the wall to meet the Persians and slaughter as many as they could.&lt;ref name=VII223&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.223 VII, 223]&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, however, the Allied rearguard was annihilated, and the pass of Thermopylae opened to the Persians.&lt;ref name=VII225&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.225.1 VII, 225]&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneous with the battle at Thermopylae, an Allied naval force of 271 triremes defended the Straits of Artemisium against the Persians.&lt;ref name = VIII2&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=8.2 VIII, 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Directly before Artemisium, the Persian fleet had been caught in a gale off the coast of [[Magnesia Prefecture|Magnesia]], losing many ships, but could still probably muster over 800 ships at the start of the battle.&lt;ref name = h276&gt;Holland, pp. 276&amp;ndash;281&lt;/ref&gt; On the first day (also the first of the Battle of Thermopylae), the Persians detached 200 seaworthy ships, which were sent to sail around the eastern coast of [[Euboea]]. These ships were to round Euboea and block the line of retreat for the Allied fleet.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt; Meanwhile, the Allies and the remaining Persians engaged in the late afternoon, the Allies having the better of the engagement and capturing 30 vessels.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt; That evening, another storm occurred, wrecking the majority of the Persian detachment which had been sent around Euboea.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=8.8 VIII, 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trireme.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Greek trireme]]

On the second day of the battle, news reached the Allies that their lines of retreat were no longer threatened; they therefore resolved to maintain their position. They staged a hit-and-run attack on some [[Cilicia]]n ships, capturing and destroying them.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231317;layout=;loc=8.15.1 VIII, 14]&lt;/ref&gt; On the third day, however, the Persian fleet attacked the Allies lines in full force. In a day of savage fighting, the Allies held on to their position, but suffered severe losses&lt;ref name = VIII16&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231319;layout=;loc=8.17.1 VIII, 16]&lt;/ref&gt; (half the Athenian fleet was damaged&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231321;layout=;loc=8.17.1 VIII, 18]&lt;/ref&gt;); nevertheless, the Allies inflicted equal losses on the Persian fleet.&lt;ref name = VIII16/&gt; That evening, the Allies received news of the fate of Leonidas and the Allies at Thermopylae. Since the Allied fleet was badly damaged, and since it no longer needed to defend the flank of Thermopylae, they retreated from Artemisium to the island of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231324;layout=;loc=8.20.1 VIII, 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

==September 480 BC: Salamis==
{{Main|Battle of Salamis}}

Victory at Thermopylae meant that all Boeotia fell to Xerxes; the two cities that had resisted him, [[Thespiae]] and [[Plataea]], were captured and razed. Attica was also left open to invasion, and the remaining population of Athens was thus evacuated, with the aid of the Allied fleet, to Salamis.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231344;layout=;loc=8.42.1 VIII, 41]&lt;/ref&gt; The Peloponnesian Allies began to prepare a defensive line across the Isthmus of Corinth, building a wall, and demolishing the road from [[Megara]], thereby abandoning Athens to the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; 

Athens fell a first time in September 480 BC.&lt;ref name="KL"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lynch |first1=Kathleen M. |title=The Symposium in Context: Pottery from a Late Archaic House Near the Athenian Agora |date=2011 |publisher=ASCSA |isbn=9780876615461 |pages=20-21, and Note 37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lCAwBt2tF6AC&amp;pg=PA20 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small number of Athenians who had barricaded themselves on the [[Acropolis]] were eventually defeated, and Xerxes then ordered Athens to be torched.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp. 305&amp;ndash;306&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Acropolis]] was razed and the [[Older Parthenon]] destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barringer |first1=Judith M. |last2=Hurwit |first2=Jeffrey M. |title=Periklean Athens and Its Legacy: Problems and Perspectives |date=2010 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=9780292782907 |page=295 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_cN7AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT295 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persians had now captured most of Greece, but Xerxes had perhaps not expected such defiance from the Greeks; his priority was now to complete the war as quickly as possible;&lt;ref name = h327&gt;Holland, pp. 327&amp;ndash;329&lt;/ref&gt; the huge invasion force could not be supplied indefinitely, and probably Xerxes did not wish to be at the fringe of his empire for so long.&lt;ref name = h308&gt;Holland, pp. 308&amp;ndash;309&lt;/ref&gt; Thermopylae had shown that a frontal assault against a well defended Greek position had little chance of success;&lt;ref name = h310/&gt; with the Allies now dug in across the isthmus, there was therefore little chance of the Persians conquering the rest of Greece by land. However, if the isthmus's defensive line could be outflanked, the Allies could be defeated.&lt;ref name="Holland, p294"&gt;Holland, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = L157/&gt; Such an outflanking of the isthmus required the use of the Persian navy, and thus the neutralisation of the Allied navy.&lt;ref name = h308/&gt;&lt;ref name = L157&gt;Lazenby, pp. 157&amp;ndash;161&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, if Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy, he would be in a strong position to force a Greek surrender; this seemed the only hope of concluding the campaign in that season.&lt;ref name = h308/&gt; Conversely by avoiding destruction, or as Themistocles hoped, by destroying the Persian fleet, the Greeks could avoid conquest. In the final reckoning, both sides were prepared to stake everything on a naval battle, in the hope of decisively altering the course of the war.&lt;ref name = h303&gt;Holland, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of salamis.png|thumb|left|300px]]

Thus it was that the Allied fleet remained off the coast of Salamis into September, despite the imminent arrival of the Persians. Even after Athens fell to the advancing Persian army, the Allied fleet still remained off the coast of Salamis, trying to lure the Persian fleet to battle.&lt;ref name = h303/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; Partly as a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the navies finally engaged in the cramped Straits of Salamis.&lt;ref name = h310&gt;Holland, pp. 310&amp;ndash;315&lt;/ref&gt; There, the large Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to manoeuvre and became disorganised.&lt;ref name = VIII89&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231398;layout=;loc=8.88.1 VIII, 89]&lt;/ref&gt; Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet attacked, and scored a decisive victory, sinking or capturing at least 200 Persian ships, and thus ensuring the Peloponnesus would not be outflanked.&lt;ref name = h320&gt;Holland, pp. 320&amp;ndash;326&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Herodotus, after this loss Xerxes attempted to build a causeway across the straits to attack Salamis (although [[Strabo]] and Ctesias place this attempt before the battle). In any case this project was soon abandoned. With the Persians' naval superiority removed, Xerxes feared that the Greeks might sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231406;layout=;loc=8.98.1 VIII, 97]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Herodotus, Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a hand-picked group of troops, while advising Xerxes to retreat to Asia with the bulk of the army.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231409;layout=;loc=8.99.1 VIII, 100]&lt;/ref&gt; All of the Persian forces abandoned Attica, with Mardonius over-wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly.&lt;ref name="h327"/&gt; 

Some Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt-out city for the winter.&lt;ref name="h327" /&gt; They would have to evacuate again in front of a second advance by Mardonius in June 479 BC.&lt;ref name="KL"/&gt;

==Autumn/winter 480/479 BC==

===Siege of Potidaea===
Herodotus tells us that a Persian general, [[Artabazos I of Phrygia|Artabazus]], having escorted Xerxes to the Hellespont with 60,000 men, began the return journey to Mardonius in Thessaly.&lt;ref name = VIII126&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231435;layout=;loc=8.127.1 VIII, 126]&lt;/ref&gt; However, as he neared [[Pallene, Chalcidice|Pallene]], &lt;blockquote&gt;"he thought it right that he should enslave the people of [[Potidaea]], whom he found in revolt."&lt;/blockquote&gt; Despite attempts to capture the Greek city by treachery,&lt;ref name = VIII128&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231437;layout=;loc=8.129.1 VIII, 128]&lt;/ref&gt; the Persians were forced to keep up the siege for three months.&lt;ref name = VIII129&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231438;layout=;loc=8.128.1 VIII, 129]&lt;/ref&gt; Then, attempting to use an unusually low tide to attack the town from sea, the Persian army was caught by the returning tide, many drowning and the survivors being attacked by the Potideans in boats.&lt;ref name = VIII129/&gt; Artabazus was thus forced to lift the siege, and return to Mardonius with the remnants of his men.&lt;ref name = VIII129/&gt;

===Siege of Olynthus===
While besieging Potidea, Artabazus also decided to besiege [[Olynthus]], which was also in revolt.&lt;ref name = VIII127&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231436;layout=;loc=8.128.1 VIII, 127]&lt;/ref&gt; The town was held by the [[Bottiaean]] tribe, who had been driven out of [[Macedon]].&lt;ref name = VIII127/&gt; Having taken the town, he massacred the defenders, and handed over the town to the [[Chalkidiki|Chalcidian]] people.&lt;ref name = VIII127/&gt;

==June 479 BC: Plataea and Mycale==
{{Main|Battle of Plataea|Battle of Mycale}}

Over the winter, there seems to have been some tension between the Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were not protected by the isthmus, but whose fleet were the key to the security of the Peloponnesus, felt hard done by. They demanded an Allied army march north the following year.&lt;ref name = h333&gt;Holland, pp. 333&amp;ndash;335&lt;/ref&gt; When the other Allies failed to commit to this, the Athenian fleet probably refused to join the Allied navy in the spring.&lt;ref name = h336/&gt; The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king [[Leotychides]], thus skulked off [[Delos]], while the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off [[Samos]], both sides unwilling to risk battle.&lt;ref name = h336/&gt; Similarly, Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the isthmus was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus.&lt;ref name = h333/&gt;

Mardonius moved to break the stalemate, by offering peace, self-government and territorial expansion to the Athenians (with the aim of thereby removing their fleet from the Allied forces), using [[Alexander I of Macedon]] as an intermediary.&lt;ref name = h336&gt;Holland, pp. 336&amp;ndash;338&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation was on hand to hear the offer, but rejected it.&lt;ref name = h336/&gt; Athens was thus evacuated again, and the Persians marched south and re-took possession of it.&lt;ref name = h336/&gt; Mardonius brought even more thorough destruction to the city.&lt;ref name="KL"/&gt; According to Herodotus, Mardonius "burnt Athens and utterly overthrew or demolished whatever wall or house or temple was left standing".&lt;ref name="KL"/&gt;

Mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the Athenian refugees on Salamis. Athens, along with Megara and Plataea, sent emissaries to Sparta demanding assistance, and threatening to accept the Persian terms if not.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231461;layout=;loc=9.7A%201 IX, 7]&lt;/ref&gt; The Spartans, who were at that time celebrating the festival of [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]]us, delayed making a decision for 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231465;layout=;loc=9.10.1 IX, 6&amp;ndash;9]&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the Athenian emissaries then delivered an ultimatum to the Spartans, they were amazed to hear that a task force was in fact already marching to meet the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231467;layout=;loc=9.10.1 IX, 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Plataea part 2.PNG|thumb|250px|left|The main battle at Plataea. The Greek retreat becomes disorganised, and the Persians cross the Asopus to attack.]]

When Mardonius heard that the Allied army was on the march, he retreated into Boeotia, near Plataea, trying to draw the Allies into open terrain where he could use his cavalry.&lt;ref name = h339&gt;Holland, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; The Allied army however, under the command of the Spartan regent [[Pausanias (general)|Pausanias]], stayed on high ground above Plataea to protect themselves against such tactics.&lt;ref name = h342&gt;Holland, pp. 342&amp;ndash;349&lt;/ref&gt; Mardonius ordered a hit-and-run cavalry attack on the Greek lines,&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=9.20 IX, 20]&lt;/ref&gt; but the attack was unsuccessful and the cavalry commander killed.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231479;layout=;loc=9.22.1 IX, 23]&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome prompted the Allies to move to a position nearer the Persian camp, still on high ground.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;layout=;query=chapter%3D%231481;loc=9.24.1 IX, 25]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Allied lines of communication were exposed. The Persian cavalry began to intercept food deliveries and finally managed to destroy the only spring of water available to the Allies.&lt;ref name = h342/&gt; The Allied position now undermined, Pausanias ordered a night-time retreat towards their original positions.&lt;ref name = h342/&gt; This went awry, leaving the Athenians, and Spartans and Tegeans isolated on separate hills, with the other contingents scattered further away, near Plataea itself.&lt;ref name = h342/&gt; Seeing that he might never have a better opportunity to attack, Mardonius ordered his whole army forward.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231515;layout=;loc=9.58.1 IX, 59]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = h350&gt;Holland, pp. 350&amp;ndash;355&lt;/ref&gt; However, as at Thermopylae, the Persian infantry proved no match for the heavily armoured Greek hoplites,&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231518;layout=;loc=9.61.1 IX, 62]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Spartans broke through to Mardonius's bodyguard and killed him.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231519;layout=;loc=9.62.1 IX, 63]&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian force thus dissolved in rout; 40,000 troops managed to escape via the road to Thessaly,&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231522;layout=;loc=9.65.1 IX, 66]&lt;/ref&gt; but the rest fled to the Persian camp where they were trapped and slaughtered by the Allies, thus finalising their victory.&lt;ref name = h350/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231521;layout=;loc=9.64.1 IX, 65]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the afternoon of the Battle of Plataea, Herodotus tells us that rumour of the Allied victory reached the Allied navy, at that time off the coast of [[Mycale|Mount Mycale]] in [[Ionia]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231556;layout=;loc=9.99.1 IX, 100]&lt;/ref&gt; Their morale boosted, the Allied marines fought and won a decisive victory at the Battle of Mycale that same day, destroying the remnants of the Persian fleet.&lt;ref name = h357&gt;Holland, pp. 357&amp;ndash;358&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as the Peloponnesians had marched north of the isthmus, the Athenian fleet under [[Xanthippus]] had joined up with the rest of the Allied fleet.&lt;ref name = h357/&gt; The fleet, now able to match the Persians, had first sailed to Samos, where the Persian fleet was based.&lt;ref name = IX96&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231552;layout=;loc=9.95.1 IX, 96]&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting, and instead drew their ships up on the beach under Mycale. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by Xerxes, and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships.&lt;ref name = IX96/&gt; However, Leotychides decided to attack the camp with the Allied fleet's marines.&lt;ref name = h357/&gt; Seeing the small size of the Allied force, the Persians emerged from the camp, but the hoplites again proved superior, and destroyed much of the Persian force.&lt;ref name = h357/&gt; The ships were abandoned to the Allies, who burnt them, crippling Xerxes' sea power, and marking the ascendancy of the Allied fleet.&lt;ref name = h357/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Snake column Hippodrome Constantinople 2007.jpg|thumb|right|115px|The [[Serpent Column]], a monument dedicated by the victorious Allies]]

{{Main|Greco-Persian Wars}}
With the twin victories of Plataea and Mycale, the second Persian invasion of Greece was over. Moreover, the threat of future invasion was abated; although the Greeks remained worried that Xerxes would try again, over time it became apparent that the Persian desire to conquer Greece was much diminished.&lt;ref name="h358"/&gt;

In many ways Mycale represents the start of a new phase of the conflict, [[Greco-Persian Wars#Greek counterattack (479–478 BC)|the Greek counterattack]].&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; After the victory at Mycale, the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont to break down the pontoon bridges, but found that this was already done.&lt;ref name = IX114&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231570;layout=;loc=9.115.1 IX, 114]&lt;/ref&gt; The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians remained to attack the [[Thracian Chersonese|Chersonesos]], still held by the Persians.&lt;ref name = IX114/&gt; The Persians in the region, and their allies made for [[Sestos]], the strongest town in the region, which the Athenians then laid siege to; after a protracted siege, it fell to the Athenians.&lt;ref name = h359/&gt; Herodotus ended his ''Historia'' after the [[Greco-Persian Wars#Sestos|Siege of Sestos]]. Over the next 30 years, the Greeks, primarily the Athenian-dominated [[Delian League]], would expel the Persians from Macedon, Thrace, the Aegean islands and Ionia.&lt;ref name = h359&gt;Holland, pp. 359&amp;ndash;363&lt;/ref&gt; Peace with Persia came in 449 BC with the [[Greco-Persian Wars#Peace with Persia|Peace of Callias]], finally ending the half-century of warfare.&lt;ref name = h359/&gt;

==Tactical analysis==
{{Main|Hoplite|Phalanx}}

The Greek style of warfare had been honed over the preceding centuries.&lt;ref name = h69&gt;Holland, pp. 69&amp;ndash;72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = L256/&gt; It revolved around the [[hoplite]], members of the middle-classes (the ''zeugites'') who could afford the armour necessary to fight in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; The hoplite was, by the standards of the time, heavily armoured, with a breastplate (originally bronze, but probably by this stage a more flexible leather version), greaves, a full helmet, and a large round shield (the ''aspis'').&lt;ref name = L256/&gt; Hoplites were armed with a long spear (the ''doru''), which was evidently significantly longer than Persian spears, and a sword (the ''xiphos'').&lt;ref name = L256/&gt; Hoplites fought in the phalanx formation; the exact details are not completely clear, but it was a close-knit formation, presenting a uniform front of overlapping shields, and spears, to the enemy.&lt;ref name = h69/&gt; Properly assembled, the phalanx was a formidable offensive and defensive weapon;&lt;ref name = L39&gt;Lazenby, pp. 39&amp;ndash;41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; on occasions when it is recorded to have happened, it took a huge number of light infantry to defeat a relatively small phalanx.&lt;ref name = L39/&gt; The phalanx was vulnerable to being outflanked by cavalry, if caught on the wrong terrain, however.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp. 187&amp;ndash;192&lt;/ref&gt; The hoplite's heavy armour and long spears made them excellent troops in hand-to-hand combat&lt;ref name = L256/&gt; and gave them significant protection against ranged attacks by light troops and skirmishers. Even if the shield did not stop a missile, there was a reasonable chance the armour would.&lt;ref name = L256/&gt;

[[File:Hoplite1.gif|thumb|130px|right|Diagram reconstructing the armament of a Greek hoplite]]

The Persian infantry used in the invasion were a heterogeneous group drawn from across the empire. However, according to Herodotus, there was at least a general conformity in the type of armour and style of fighting.&lt;ref name = L23&gt;Lazenby, pp. 23&amp;ndash;29&lt;/ref&gt; The troops were, generally speaking, armed with a bow, 'short spear' and sword, carried a wicker shield, and wore at most a leather jerkin.&lt;ref name = L23/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; The one exception to this may have been the ethnic Persian troops, who may have worn a corslet of scaled armour.&lt;ref name = L23/&gt; Some of the contingents may have been armed somewhat differently;&lt;ref name = L23/&gt; for instance, the [[Saka]] were renowned axemen.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp. 17&amp;ndash;18&lt;/ref&gt; The 'elite' contingents of the Persian infantry seem to have been the ethnic Persians, [[Medes|Medians]], [[Khuzistan|Cissians]] and the Saka.&lt;ref name = L23/&gt; The foremost of the infantry were the royal guards, the [[Persian Immortals|Immortals]], although they were still armed in the aforementioned style.&lt;ref name = L23/&gt;&lt;ref name = h274&gt;Holland, p. 274&amp;ndash;275&lt;/ref&gt; Cavalry was provided by the Persians, [[Bactria]]ns, Medes, Cissians and Saka; most of these probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry.&lt;ref name = L23/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; The style of fighting used by the Persians was probably to stand off from an enemy, using their bows (or equivalent) to wear down the enemy before closing in to deliver the ''coup de grace'' with spear and sword.&lt;ref name = L23/&gt;

[[File:Archers frieze Darius palace Louvre AOD487.jpg|thumb|left|Persian soldiers, possibly Immortals, a frieze in Darius's palace at [[Susa]]. Silicious glazed bricks, c. 510 BC, [[Louvre]].]]

The Persians had encountered hoplites in battle before at [[Ionian Revolt#Battle of Ephesus|Ephesus]], where their cavalry had easily routed the (probably exhausted) Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp. 160&amp;ndash;161&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the battle of Marathon, the Athenian hoplites had shown their superiority over the Persian infantry, albeit in the absence of any cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp. 192&amp;ndash;197&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore slightly surprising that the Persians did not bring any hoplites from the Greek regions, especially Ionia, under their control in Asia.&lt;ref name = L23/&gt; Equally, Herodotus tells us that the Egyptian marines serving in the navy were well armed, and performed well against the Greek marines; yet no Egyptian contingent served in the army.&lt;ref name = L256/&gt; The Persians may not have completely trusted the Ionians and Egyptians, since both had recently revolted against Persian rule. However, if this is the case, then it must be questioned why there were Greek and Egyptian contingents in the navy. The Allies evidently tried to play on the Persian fears about the reliability of the Ionians in Persian service;&lt;ref name = VIII22&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231325;layout=;loc=8.23.1 VIII, 22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = IX98&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231554;layout=;loc=9.97.16 IX, 98]&lt;/ref&gt; but, as far as we can tell, both the Ionians and Egyptians performed particularly well for the Persian navy.&lt;ref name = L23/&gt; It may therefore simply be that neither the Ionians nor Egyptians were included in the army because they were serving in the fleet &amp;mdash; none of the coastal regions of the Persian empire appear to have sent contingents with the army.&lt;ref name = L23/&gt;

In the two major land battles of the invasion, the Allies clearly adjusted their tactics to nullify the Persian advantage in numbers and cavalry, by occupying the pass at Thermopylae, and by staying on high ground at Plataea.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; At Thermopylae, until the path outflanking the Allied position was revealed, the Persians signally failed to adjust their tactics to the situation, although the position was well chosen to limit the Persian options.&lt;ref name = h274/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; At Plataea, the harassing of the Allied positions by cavalry was a successful tactic, forcing the precipitous (and nearly disastrous) retreat; however, Mardonius then brought about a general melee between the infantry, which resulted in the Persian defeat.&lt;ref name = L254/&gt; The events at Mycale reveal a similar story; Persian infantry committing themselves to a melee with hoplites, with disastrous results.&lt;ref name = h357/&gt; It has been suggested that there is little evidence of complex tactics in the Greco-Persian wars.&lt;ref name = L258&gt;Lazenby, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; However, as simple as the Greek tactics were, they played to their strengths; the Persians however, may have seriously underestimated the strength of the hoplite, and their failure to adapt to facing the Allied infantry contributed to the eventual Persian defeat.&lt;ref name = L23/&gt;&lt;ref name = L258/&gt;&lt;ref name = L258/&gt;

==Strategic analysis==
[[File:Xerxes detail Scythian.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Scythians]] (''[[Sakas]]'') formed a large portion of the Achaemenid army. Detail of the tomb of Xerxes I at [[Naqsh-e Rostam]], circa 480 BC.]]
At the beginning of the invasion, it is clear that the Persians held most advantages.&lt;ref name = L248&gt;Lazenby, p. 248&amp;ndash;253&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of its actual size, it is clear that the Persians had brought an overwhelming number of troops and ships to Greece.&lt;ref name = souza/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians had a unified command system, and everyone was answerable to the king.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; They had a hugely efficient bureaucracy, which allowed them to undertake remarkable feats of planning.&lt;ref name = h213/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, pp. 17&amp;ndash;18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian generals had significant experience of warfare over the 80 years in which the Persian empire had been established.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Persians excelled in the use of intelligence and diplomacy in warfare, as shown by their (nearly successful) attempts to divide-and-conquer the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, pp. 29&amp;ndash;30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp. 311&amp;ndash;313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp. 344&amp;ndash;345&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks, by comparison, were fragmented, with only 30 or so city-states actively opposing the Persian invasion; even those were prone to quarrel with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, pp. 21&amp;ndash;22&lt;/ref&gt; They had little experience of large-scale warfare, being largely restricted to small-scale local warfare,&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; and their commanders were chosen primarily on the basis of the political and social standing, rather than because of any experience or expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, pp. 37&amp;ndash;38&lt;/ref&gt; As Lazenby therefore asks: ''"So why did the Persians fail?"''&lt;ref name = L248/&gt;

The Persian strategy for 480 BC was probably to simply progress through Greece in overwhelming force.&lt;ref name =L254/&gt; The cities in any territory that the army passed through would be forced to submit or risk destruction; and indeed this happened with the Thessalian, Locrian and Phocian cities who initially resisted the Persians but then were forced to submit as the Persians advanced.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=9.17.1 IX, 17]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.172 VII, 172]&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the Allied strategy was probably to try and stop the Persian advance as far north as possible, and thus prevent the submission of as many potential Allies as possible.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; Beyond this, the Allies seem to have realised that given the Persians' overwhelming numbers, they had little chance in open battle, and thus they opted to try to defend geographical bottle-necks, where the Persian numbers would count for less.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; The whole Allied campaign for 480 BC can be seen in this context. Initially they attempted to defend the [[Vale of Tempe|Tempe pass]] to prevent the loss of [[Thessaly]].&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; After they realised that they could not defend this position, they chose the next-most northerly position, the Thermopylae/Artemisium axis.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; The [[Battle of Thermopylae|Allied performance at Thermopylae]] was initially effective; however, the failure to properly guard the path that outflanked Thermopylae undermined their strategy, and led to defeat.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; At Artemisium the fleet also scored some successes, but withdrew due to the losses they had sustained, and since the defeat of Thermopylae made the position irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, pp. 149&amp;ndash;150&lt;/ref&gt; Thus far, the Persian strategy had succeeded, while the Allied strategy, though not a disaster, had failed.

[[File:Xerxes I tomb Persian soldier circa 480 BCE.jpg|thumb|upright|A Persian soldier of the Achaemenid army. Detail of the tomb of Xerxes I at [[Naqsh-e Rostam]], circa 480 BC.]]
The defence of the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] by the Allies changed the nature of the war. The Persians did not attempt to attack the isthmus by land, realising they probably could not breach it.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; This essentially reduced the conflict to a naval one.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; Themistocles now proposed what was in hindsight the strategic masterstroke in the Allied campaign; to lure the Persian fleet to [[Battle of Salamis|battle in the straits of Salamis]].&lt;ref name = L248/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 316&amp;ndash;317&lt;/ref&gt; However, as successful as this was, there was no need for the Persians to fight at Salamis to win the war; it has been suggested that the Persians were either overconfident, or overeager to finish the campaign.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp. 307&amp;ndash;308&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Allied victory at Salamis must at least partially be ascribed to a Persian strategic blunder.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; After Salamis, the Persian strategy changed. Mardonius sought to exploit dissensions between the Allies in order to fracture the alliance.&lt;ref name = L254&gt;Lazenby, 254&amp;ndash;255&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he sought to win over the Athenians, which would leave the Allied fleet unable to oppose Persian landings on the Peloponnesus.&lt;ref name = h333/&gt; Although Herodotus tells us that Mardonius was keen to fight a decisive battle, his actions in the run-up to Plataea are not particularly consistent with this.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; He seems to have been willing to accept battle on his terms, but he waited either for the Allies to attack, or for the alliance to collapse ignominiously.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; The Allied strategy for 479 BC was something of a mess; the Peloponnesians only agreed to march north in order to save the alliance, and it appears that the Allied leadership had little idea how to force a battle that they could win.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; It was the botched attempt to retreat from Plataea that finally delivered the Allies battle on their terms.&lt;ref name = L254/&gt; Mardonius may have been overeager for victory; there was no need to attack the Allies, and by doing so he played to the main Allied tactical strength, combat in the melee.&lt;ref name = L254/&gt; The Allied victory at Plataea can also therefore be seen as partially the result of a Persian mistake.&lt;ref name = L254/&gt;

Thus, the Persian failure may be seen partly as a result of two strategic mistakes that handed the Allies tactical advantages, and resulted in decisive defeats for the Persians.&lt;ref name = L254/&gt; The Allied success is often seen as the result of "''free men fighting for their freedom''".&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; This may have played a part, and certainly the Greeks seem to have interpreted their victory in those terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://victorhanson.com/articles/hanson101106.html |title=VDH's Private Papers::History and the Movie "300" |date=2009-02-16 |access-date=2017-02-28 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216132658/http://victorhanson.com/articles/hanson101106.html |archivedate=2009-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One crucial factor in the Allied success was that, having formed an alliance, however fractious, they remained true to it, despite the odds.&lt;ref name = L254/&gt; There appear to have been many occasions when the alliance seemed in doubt, but ultimately it withstood; and while this alone did not defeat the Persians, it meant that even after the occupation of most of Greece, the Allies were not themselves defeated.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; This is exemplified by the remarkable fact that the citizens of Athens, Thespiae and Plataea chose to carry on fighting from exile rather than submit to the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, pp. 259&amp;ndash;261&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the Allies succeeded because they avoided catastrophic defeats,&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; stuck to their alliance,&lt;ref name = L254/&gt; took advantage of Persian mistakes,&lt;ref name = L254/&gt; and because in the hoplite they possessed an advantage (perhaps their only real advantage at the start of the conflict), which, at Plataea, allowed them to destroy the Persian invasion force.&lt;ref name = L256&gt;Lazenby, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
[[File:Greek-Persian duel.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Greek hoplite and Persian warrior depicted fighting. Ancient kylix, 5th century BC.]]

The second Persian invasion of Greece was an event of major significance in European history. A large number of historians hold that, had Greece been conquered, the Ancient Greek culture that lies at the basis of [[Western civilization]] would have never developed (and by extension Western civilization itself).&lt;ref name = hanson2&gt;Hanson, ''Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise of Western Power''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, pp. 1–294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp xvii–xix&lt;/ref&gt; While this may be an exaggeration, it is clear that even at the time the Greeks understood that something very significant had happened.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

Militarily, there was not much in the way of tactical or strategic innovation during the Persian invasion, one commentator suggesting it was something of "a soldier's war" (i.e., it was the soldiers rather than generals that won the war).&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, pp. 257–258&lt;/ref&gt; Thermopylae is often used as a good example of the use of terrain as a [[force multiplier]],&lt;ref name=usarmy&gt;Eikenberry (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; while Themistocles's ruse before Salamis is a good example of the use of deception in warfare. The major lesson of the invasion, reaffirming the events at the Battle of Marathon, was the superiority of the hoplite in close-quarters fighting over the more-lightly armed Persian infantry.&lt;ref name = h358&gt;Holland, p. 358–359&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = L256/&gt; Taking on this lesson, the Persian empire would later, after the [[Peloponnesian War]], start recruiting and relying on Greek mercenaries.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0202;query=chapter%3D%231;layout=;loc=1.2.1 Anabasis]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Seoul International Cartoon and Animation Festival''' ('''SICAF''', {{lang-ko|서울 국제 만화 애니메이션 페스티벌}}) is an annual [[Variety show|showcase]] [[festival]] of [[animation]], [[cartoon]] and related art genres held in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]] since 1995. It is sponsored by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, and the city of Seoul. The main mascots are "Bummy" (버미) the tiger (after the original Korean word "bum(범)", which means tiger), and "Tanko" (땡고추, very hot chili pepper).

The festival has exhibitions, showing of animation films, promotion booths and various special events. There are an official competition section and invited guest section. Awards are given to the categories of long animation, short animation, TV &amp; commissioned works, and internet animation. Online popularity votes are held as well.

'''Soundwave''' was an annual [[music festival]] held in major cities around Australia. The festival originated in [[Perth, Western Australia]] and began travelling to the other [[List of Australian capital cities|Australian capital cities]] in 2007. It features a number of international and Australian music acts, from various genres including [[rock music|rock]], [[metal (music)|metal]] and [[punk rock|punk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/soundwave-festival-brings-wave-of-black/story-e6frfn09-1225831608714|title=Soundwave Festival brings wave of black |publisher=[[News Limited|News.com.au]] |date=18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival has been headlined by [[Deftones]], [[The Offspring]], [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Alice in Chains]], [[Bloodhound Gang]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Faith No More]], [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Jane's Addiction]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Queens of the Stone Age]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[System of a Down]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Green Day]], [[Avenged Sevenfold]], [[Linkin Park]], [[Blink-182]] and [[Metallica]]. The festival was run and promoted by Soundwave Touring, who also run Harvest Festival and promote tours for bands and musicians each year.

On 17 December 2015, the Soundwave founder, music promoter [[AJ Maddah]], announced that the 2016 Soundwave festival was cancelled due to poor ticket sales. This was announced two days after the announcement that 2016 would be the final Soundwave festival.

==History==

The Soundwave festival originated in Perth,&lt;ref name="News09"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,28383,24395484-5016486,00.html|title=Soundwave nails in 2009 dates|publisher=News.com.au| first=Ian | last=Rakowski | date=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a smaller festival known as Gravity Soundwave within the [[Gravity Games]].&lt;ref name="2005gg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gravitygamesh2o.com/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&amp;aid=100|title=For fans of action sports and extreme fun|publisher=GravityGames H2O|date=15 September 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820010658/http://gravitygamesh2o.com/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&amp;aid=100 |archivedate=20 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gravity Games were held in South Perth along the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]], being based mainly on water-based and action sports. The event was sponsored by [[Vodafone]] in its first year, with the company reportedly committing one million dollars to the event. Gravity Soundwave provided the music side of the festival, which took place at McCallum Park alongside the Swan River.&lt;ref name="versus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.versus.com/article/view/317?tf=gg_articleView.tpl|title=H2O – Good Charlotte Announced for Second Soundwave Concert|publisher=Versus |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307203313/http://www.versus.com/article/view/317?tf=gg_articleView.tpl |archivedate=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravity Soundwave was first introduced in the festival's first year, which was held on 14 and 15 October 2004. American [[pop punk]] band [[Good Charlotte]] effectively became the first headline act of Soundwave, when they performed in the festival's first night along with Gyroscope and [[One Dollar Short]].&lt;ref name="versus" /&gt; The following night featured [[Unwritten Law]], [[Regurgitator]], [[MxPx]],  [[Lagwagon]] and Last Year's Hero.&lt;ref name="versus" /&gt;

The 2005 festival was again presented by Vodafone, being held on the night of 8 October. Gravity Soundwave was headlined by [[Grinspoon]], with it also featuring American acts [[Unwritten Law]], [[Reel Big Fish]], and [[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]].&lt;ref name="2005gg" /&gt;

The third and final year of the Gravity Games festival in Perth was moved to December 2006, instead of October. Gravity Soundwave featured American act [[Aiden]], local Australian bands [[Gyroscope]], [[Kisschasy]], [[Parkway Drive]], [[The Getaway Plan]] and New Zealanders [[Goodnight Nurse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gravitygamesh2o.com/default.aspx?s=gravity%27gfest%27concerts|title=Gravity 'G Fest' Concerts are Set to Soar in December!|publisher=GravityGames H2O|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830012155/http://gravitygamesh2o.com/default.aspx?s=gravity%27gfest%27concerts |archivedate=30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lineup for the 2012 festival was first announced on 7 October 2011. The 2012 Soundwave lineup featured [[System of a Down]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Limp Bizkit]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]].

This was the first time [[Limp Bizkit]] had toured Australia in eleven years. Their previous tour was the [[Big Day Out#Death of Jessica Michalik|2001 Big Day Out]] festival, which was marred by the death of 16-year-old [[Jessica Michalik]] during their performance at the Sydney show. Limp Bizkit singer [[Fred Durst]] paid tribute to Michalik at each Soundwave date and openly criticised Big Day Out organisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McCabe |first=Kathy |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/limp-bizkits-fred-durst-attacks-big-day-out-organisers-at-soundwave-festival-as-decidate-comeback-to-jessica-michalik/story-e6frfn09-1226284700652 |title=Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst attacks Big Day Out organisers at Soundwave Festival |publisher=News.com.au |date=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival also featured a reunited [[Coal Chamber]], who played their first shows since 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coalchamberofficial.com/news/coal-chamber-announces-plans-to-reform-for-australian-soundwave-shows |title=Coal Chamber Announces Plans to Reform for Australian Soundwave Shows |publisher=Coal Chamber (official website) |date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also marked the final shows of emo group [[Thursday (band)|Thursday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s3374196.htm |title=Thursday to quit after Soundwave shows |publisher=Triple J |date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This edition of Soundwave was noted for its "drummers' curse",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mann |first=Tom |url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/34962/Soundwave-drummer-curse-claims-another-victim |title=Soundwave drummer 'curse' claims another victim |publisher=Faster Louder |date=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where several bands lost members in the week leading up to the festival:

* [[Blink-182]] drummer [[Travis Barker]] was to attempt the long-haul flight and participate in Blink-182's first Australian tour since 2004, saying ''"[I'm] getting knocked out and getting on a plane to Australia"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s3559822.htm#.USRho6VvCSo|title=

However, after months of counselling and medication, Barker could not overcome his fear of flying and was replaced on the tour by [[Brooks Wackerman]] from [[Bad Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.triplem.com.au/sydney/music/news/drummer-travis-barker-pulls-out-of-blink-182-australian-tour-and-soundwave-festival-2013|title=Travis Barker Pulls Out Of Blink-182 Tour|publisher=[[Triple M]]|date=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[The Vandals]] drummer [[Josh Freese]] (formerly of [[A Perfect Circle]] and [[Paramore]], both were also on the lineup) was replaced by [[Alkaline Trio]] drummer [[Derek Grant (drummer)|Derek Grant]]&lt;ref name="curse"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mann |first=Tom |url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/34960/Soundwave-band-cancels-tour-after-dirtbike-mishap |title=Soundwave band cancels tour after 'dirtbike mishap' |publisher=Faster Louder |date=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to other commitments.  
* [[Six Feet Under (band)|Six Feet Under]] withdrew from the lineup due to drummer [[Kevin Talley]] being injured in a dirtbike accident&lt;ref name="curse" /&gt;
* In addition, [[Shai Hulud]] vocalist Justin Kraus was hospitalised with chest pain immediately after playing a show in [[Trenton, New Jersey]],&lt;ref&gt;Shai Hulud.

* [[Gallows (band)|Gallows]] guitarist Stephen Carter left the band in the days leading up to the festival, the band continued as a four-piece.&lt;ref&gt;Gallows. [http://www.facebook.com/gallows/posts/10151549487047425 20 February at 06:00]. Facebook.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also controversy regarding bands such as [[Pierce the Veil]] and [[The Amity Affliction]] having their sets cut short in Perth due to complaints from local residents - after this Maddah doubted the festival's future in Western Australia.

This festival featured 72 acts across nine stages (eight stages in Perth).

The lineup containing 94 bands, featured Green Day, Avenged Sevenfold, Korn and Alice In Chains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152050217462262&amp;set=a.182475132261.123455.15040347261&amp;type=1&amp;relevant_count=1|title=Log In or Sign Up to View|author=|date=|website=www.facebook.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Perth festival was relocated from [[Claremont Showground]] to [[Arena Joondalup]], 25&amp;nbsp;km north of Perth, two weeks before the beginning of the festival due to Soundwave's ongoing conflict with the [[Town of Claremont|Claremont Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tonedeaf.com.au/news/tournews/385206/soundwave-2014-makes-last-minute-venue-change.htm|title=Soundwave 2014 Makes Last Minute Venue Change|publisher=Tone Deaf|date=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a similar situation at the Perth leg of [[Big Day Out]] in January of that year, which was also relocated from Claremont Showground to Arena Joondalup, AJ Maddah confirmed that 2014 would be the last Soundwave held in Perth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/38597/AJ-Maddah-devastated-there-wont-be-a-Perth-Soundwave-in-2015|title=AJ Maddah "devastated" there won’t be a Perth Soundwave in 2015|publisher=fasterlouder.com.au|date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the festival originated.

==2015==
On 28 June 2014, Soundwave announced that it will become a two-day festival,&lt;ref name="2days"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/soundwave-2015-will-be-a-two-day-festival|title=Soundwave 2015 Will Be A Two-Day Festival|publisher=Music Feeds|date=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; held over two consecutive weekends, with half the bands announced playing day one and the other half playing day two, criss-crossing between Adelaide and Melbourne, then Sydney and Brisbane. AJ Maddah stated on Twitter ''"Putting the line-up across [two] days enables us to minimise clashes; give bands longer sets, better staging, production [and] infrastructure. I am also hoping that this will give fans better value for money and a less stressful day."''&lt;ref name="2days" /&gt; AJ Maddah later confirmed that 2015 was the last Soundwave for Adelaide in the foreseeable future as it made a $300,000 loss in 2014, but with the $1,400,000 loss in 2015 due to lackluster ticket sales being to large to subsidise out of the other cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/42038/Exclusive-AJ-Maddah-on-how-Adelaide-nearly-wiped-out-Soundwave Exclusive: AJ Maddah on how Adelaide nearly "wiped out" Soundwave].

==Proposed 2016 Lineup and Cancellation==
On 20 March 2015, AJ Maddah stated that Soundwave 2016 would return to the one-day format and would be held in January instead of the usual late February/early March dates. He also later stated that the 2016 lineup would be announced via "drip-feeding" and would also be smaller in order to achieve longer set times for bands.

[[Bullet for My Valentine]] was announced as the first act of Soundwave 2016 via the band's social media accounts and the official Soundwave website on 14 August 2015, and over the next four months, [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]] was announced as the headliner and 24 other bands were added for a total of 26 bands.

On 15 December 2015, Maddah [[Twitter|tweeted]] that 2016 would be the final ever Soundwave, stating it was due to "stress and haters", and two days later he tweeted that the festival had been officially cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;name=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-15/soundwave-boss-pulls-2017-festival-due-to-stress-and-haters/7031510&lt;/ref&gt;

Various problems contributed to its cancellation, including:
* Poor ticket sales (Maddah once stated that 2016 would "sell out instantly", but around 20,000 tickets in total had been sold at the time of its cancellation){{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
* [[L7 (band)|L7]] pulling out for unspecified reasons{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
* [[Bring Me the Horizon]] claiming in December 2015 that they weren't officially confirmed to perform at the festival despite being announced months beforehand{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
* The festival's advertised venues reportedly not being booked{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
* Backlash from fans concerning the long length of time that it took for Maddah to announce the full lineup and also for including bands that were deemed unfit for a metal and rock festival (such as Public Enemy, The Prodigy, and the (at the time) lesser known groups Nothing But Thieves and Moose Blood).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
* Fans receiving the wrong tickets in the mail or not receiving them at all{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
* The festival's operating company going into [[Australian insolvency law|voluntary administration]] over an unpaid debt{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
* Reports surfacing that Maddah owes a total of over $11 million to all the bands who played the 2015 festival after they claimed that they were not paid.&lt;ref&gt;name=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/heres-much-money-soundwave-2015-acts-owed/#/slide/1&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6657">'''Students Against Destructive Decisions''', formerly '''Students Against Driving Drunk''' (SADD) is an organization whose aim is to prevent accidents from students taking potentially destructive decisions.

==Mission==
The mission of the SADD chapter is to help people avoid the dangers of drinking and driving. Today, their mission has expanded to deal with underage drinking, other drug use, risky and impaired driving, discrimination, bullying, and other destructive decisions.

==Profile==
SADD's approach involves young people presenting education and prevention messages to their peers through school and community activities. Projects include peer-led classes and forums, teen workshops, conferences and rallies, prevention education and leadership training, awareness-raising activities and legislative work.

As of 2012, there are nearly 10,000 Middle school, high school, and college chapters with SADD advisors. There are 350,000 students actively participating ("members") in SADD chapters.

==History==
SADD was founded by Robert Anastas at [[Wayland High School]] in [[Massachusetts]] in 1981. He and a group of 15 students developed the SADD concept and the Contract for Life. In 1982, SADD went national with offices founded throughout Massachusetts, [[Arizona]], [[Ohio]], [[North Carolina]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Florida]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Maine]]. In 1984, [[Dear Abby]] and [[Ask Ann Landers|Ann Landers]] printed the Contract for Life, suggesting to all readers that they request a copy from SADD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19840117&amp;id=e5orAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1vkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6832,2617414|date=1984-01-17|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&amp;dat=19850523&amp;id=36ImAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yQEGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1161,2187357|publisher=The Miami News|date=1985-05-23|accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SADD National office was inundated with 8,000 requests per week for six weeks. Also that year, "Contract for Life: The SADD Story" aired on [[CBS]] as a CBS Schoolbreak Special,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/10890/Contract-for-Life-The-S-A-D-D-Story/overview|title=Contract for Life: The S.A.D.D. Story (1985)|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carl Olsen, the first SADD president at Wayland High School, was appointed by the Director of Health and Human Services as the only student to a three-year panel studying the alcoholism in America.

The following year, SADD offices were established in Germany and Guam. Also in 1985, SADD had its first presidential moment when [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]] met with SADD students of [[River Dell Regional High School|River Dell High School]] in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=40073|title=The American Presidency Project: Ronald Reagan, Remarks at River Dell High School in Oradell, New Jersey|accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, SADD offices were established in schools in the Soviet Union. Also that year, the SADD National Board of Directors voted to cease accepting contributions from the alcohol industry.

In 1990, The American College of Physicians awarded the Edward G. Loveland Memorial Award to SADD for its contributions to the health field.

In 1992. William Cullinane became Executive Director of SADD.

The following year, the SADD Board of Directors voted not to accept funds from the alcohol industry.

In 1995, SADD received a letter of commendation from [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]]. The next year,
Margaret Altstaetter, SADD Student of the Year 1995-1996, was invited to participate in the White House Leadership Conference on Youth, Drug Use and Violence.

==Chapters==

;Name Change
A new name was adopted in 1997: Students Against Destructive Decisions.

In 1999, three Student Leadership Council members, Lynsey Ross, Jereme McBride, and Carrie LeBlanc, were appointed to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy Leadership Team.

SADD's Board of Directors appointed Penny Wells as its new President and Executive Director in 2000.

SADD launched its National Scholarship Program in 2002, awarding its first two scholarships the following year.

In 2004, Jacqueline Hackett, Executive Committee member of the 2003-2004 SADD National SLC, testified before the Congressional Subcommittee on Education Reform at the hearing "Preventing Underage Drinking: What Works?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.republicans.edlabor.house.gov/archive/hearings/108th/edr/drinking021104/hackett.htm|title=Testimony of Jacqueline Hackett|accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, SADD attended a special White House event during which [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] highlighted a decline in youth drug use from 2001 to 2007.

In 2008, SADD partnered with the White House's [[National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign]] to raise awareness about the link between stress and drug use among teens and about prescription drug use.

By 2009, the SADDvocate, SADD's monthly e-newsletter for students and advisors, had reached more than 11,000 subscribers.

In 2010 SADD successfully lobbied for the introduction of the STARS (Students Taking Action for Road Safety) Act. In October, SADD received an international drug abuse prevention award from the Queen of Sweden. Also, [[Mentor Foundation|The Mentor International Foundation]] presented SADD with the 2010 Youth Initiative Award for "Mobilizing the Community: Youth Taking the Lead." SADD also took part in the [[Oprah Winfrey]] led "No phone zone day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/pressroom/Oprah-Winfreys-National-No-Phone-Zone-Day_1|title=Oprah-Winfreys-National-No-Phone-Zone-Day|accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teaching and Language Corpora''' (TaLC) is the name of a biennial conference that focusses on [[data-driven learning]] (DDL),  an approach to language teaching and learning.

These conferences aim to promote classroom applications of language [[Corpus linguistics|corpora]], data-driven learning, as well as the creation of corpus-informed teaching materials and other resources, and foster discussion between practitioners, researchers and theorists from all over the world.

'''The September Concert''' is a charity which organises free public concerts on the anniversaries of [[9/11]]. It was founded by Haruko Smith, following the events of that day in 2001.&lt;ref name="heraldsun" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:NDI Sept Conc.jpg|thumb|250px|right|National Dance Institute at Rockefeller Plaza, 9/11/2010]]

Following the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11th 2001]], Haruko Smith had the idea to fill the skies of NYC with music, inspired by the words of [[Aldous Huxley]]:

{{quote|After silence, that which can express the inexpressible, is music}}

The September Concert started out as a local grassroots charity and has grown to have a worldwide presence involving 10,000 volunteers and 15,000 musicians.&lt;ref name="mission" /&gt;

[[File:ROME September Concert.jpg|thumb|250px|left| September Concert in Rome, 9/11/2010]]

The September Concert Foundation was incorporated in April 2002 as a 501(c)(3) public charity, inspired a small army of volunteers, and on September 11th 2002 the first September Concert was born. To date this organization has functioned solely through the efforts of volunteers.

In addition to the Board of Directors that included artists [[Jacques d'Amboise (dancer)|Jacques d'Amboise]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], The September Concert Foundation's Advisory Board was set up in 2002 with  entertainers such as [[Quincy Jones]], [[Ravi Shankar]] and [[Christy Turlington Burns]]. Business leaders such as [[Tom Freston]] also joined in to help the foundation.

In 2010, 200 concerts were held all over the world on or near September 11. In [[New York City]] 58 concerts were held,&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nationaldance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eturbonews" /&gt; joined by another 30 U.S. cities &lt;ref name="mydesert"/&gt; and 45 international cities including [[Edinburgh]] &lt;ref name="mynewsdesk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="inchoruschoir" /&gt; [[London]], [[Rome]],&lt;ref name="insidersabroad" /&gt; [[Tamale]] (Ghana), [[Cap-Haïtien]] and [[Tokyo]].

==Mission and principles==
[[File:September Concert Haiti.jpg|thumb|right| September Concert in Haiti, 9/10/2010]]

The mission of the September Concert Foundation is to bring communities together, to reaffirm the hope for peace, and to celebrate our universal humanity.
 
The foundation accomplishes this by inviting musicians of every age and genre to bring their gift of music anywhere space is available on the days surrounding the anniversary of September 11. Concerts are held in parks, gardens, schools, libraries, churches, restaurants, cafes, galleries, office buildings, stores, senior centers, community centers.

There are three principles behind the September Concert:
*''Freedom'' for anyone to organise a concert with any genre and venue;
*''Equality'' between the different musicians and styles of music; and
*''Accessibility'': all of the concerts are free

[[File:Former Festival Theatre, Cambridge Geograph-2593449-by-Keith-Edkins.jpg|thumb|Interior of the former theatre in 2011]]
The '''Theatre Royal''' was built in the Barnwell suburb of Cambridge, England, in 1816. It closed later that century but reopened as the '''Cambridge Festival Theatre''' from 1926 until 1935. The building, in which part of the interior of the theatre survives, is Grade II* listed.

== 19th century  ==
William Wilkins (1751–1815){{sfn|Searby|1988|p=699}}, a building contractor, was proprietor of a chain of theatres in East Anglia known as the Norwich circuit. Performers included the [[Norwich Company of Comedians]], and performances had been given since the late 18th century on Stourbridge Common, north of the city of Cambridge, at the annual [[Stourbridge fair]].{{sfn|Searby|1988|p=693}} Wilkins and his son, also [[William Wilkins (architect)|William]] (1778–1839), built a theatre in 1807 at Sun Street, [[Barnwell, Cambridgeshire|Barnwell]]. The younger Wilkins – a prominent architect who had designed [[Downing College, Cambridge|Downing College]] and went on to work at other colleges and the National Gallery – designed a new theatre nearby to replace the 1807 building.{{sfn|Searby|1988|p=701}}

The building is on the south side of the Newmarket Road in the northeastern Cambridge suburb of Barnwell. Completed in 1816, the theatre was sited outside the boundary of the town owing to prohibition of theatrical entertainment by the [[Cambridge University|University]] authorities&lt;ref name=listing&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1126148|desc=Arts Theatre Workshop and Store|access-date=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a 1737 act "for the More Effectual Preventing the Unlawful Playing of Interludes within the Precincts of the Two Universities ..." forbade the performance of all plays and operas within five miles of the town).{{sfn|Searby|1988|pp=696–700}}

On his father's death in 1815, Wilkins inherited the leases of the new site and six other theatres – Norwich, Bury St Edmunds, Colchester, Yarmouth, Ipswich and King's Lynn{{sfn|Searby|1988|pp=696–701}} – and continued to run them. Proprietorship passed to his son, W Bushby Wilkins, and a succession of lessees, but the Norwich circuit declined.{{sfn|Searby|1988|pp=696–706}} The theatre closed in 1878 and became a [[Nonconformism|nonconformist]] chapel.&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite web|title=The Festival Theatre, Cambridge|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-festival-theatre-cambridge-1568393.html|website=The Independent|date=17 January 1995|last=Davies|first=Andrew John|accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cambridge Festival Theatre ==
[[Terence Gray]] (1895–1986) leased the building in 1926 and reopened it as the Cambridge Festival Theatre. The alleyway between the street and the building was enclosed to form a foyer. The interior was modernised, with the [[proscenium]] arch widened by the removal of the private boxes,&lt;ref name="Justice-Malloy2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rhona Justice-Malloy|title=Theatre History Studies 2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6ioKbxcTHgC|date=9 August 2009|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=978-0-8173-5554-8|pages=171–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the introduction of electric lighting, a brick [[cyclorama]] and an early example of a [[revolving stage]].&lt;ref name=listing /&gt; The theatre was the country's "first permanent indoor performing space to be based on the design of a Greek open-air theatre".&lt;ref name="Easterling1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=P. E. Easterling|title=The Cambridge Companion to Greek Tragedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_kx9eeSJyeoC|date=2 October 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42351-9|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Festival' name reflected Grey's intention (unfulfilled) to promote summer festivals.&lt;ref name="Justice-Malloy2009" /&gt; The opening production on 22 November 1926 was ''[[Oresteia]]'', with choreography by [[Ninette de Valois]].&lt;ref name="Easterling1997" /&gt;

Grey retired from the theatre in 1933&lt;ref name=independent /&gt; and went on to write on [[Taoism]] under the pseudonym "Wei Wu Wei".  [[Norman Marshall (theatre director)|Norman Marshall]] worked at the theatre from 1926 and was its director from 1932 to 1933.

From 1927, [[Joseph Macleod]] was an actor and producer at the theatre, and in 1933 he became the theatre's director and lessee. Five of Macleod's plays were staged there, including ''Overture to Cambridge'' (1933) and ''A Woman Turned to Stone'' (1934). Under Macleod, the theatre became known for its avant-garde productions, and staging of lesser known works by great playwrights. Macleod staged some of [[Ezra Pound]]'s Noh plays, and also some [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]] and [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] (his company, The Cambridge Festival Players, was one of the first in the UK to stage Chekhov's play ''[[The Seagull]]''). The theatre was obliged to close due to financial difficulties in June 1935.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The building was recorded as [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade II* listed]] in 1950.&lt;ref name=listing /&gt; From 1962 it was used by the [[Cambridge Arts Theatre|Arts Theatre]] as a workshop and store.&lt;ref name=independent /&gt;

== Today ==
[[File:Cambridge Buddhist Centre, Newmarket Road.JPG|thumb|upright|Entrance in 2013]]

[[Historic England]] describe the interior as "a virtually complete example of a Georgian theatre with a three-tiered horsehoe auditorium with the galleries supported on cast iron columns." and state that a painting of the Royal Arms remains above the [[proscenium]].&lt;ref name=listing /&gt;

The '''Théâtre des Folies-Marigny''', a former Parisian theatre with a capacity of only 300 spectators, was built in 1848 by the [[Paris|City of Paris]] for a magician named Lacaze and was originally known as the '''Salle Lacaze'''.&lt;ref&gt;Faris 1980, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; It was located at the east end of the Carré Marigny of the [[Champs-Élysées]], close to the Avenue Marigny, but faced west toward the [[Cirque National]] on the other side of the square.

In 1855 the Salle Lacaze became the home of [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s [[Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens]], where he first built his reputation as a theatre composer. It was subsequently used unsuccessfully by several companies until 1864, when it again became a profitable operetta theatre called the Folies-Marigny. When this company diminished in popularity, the theatre was closed. It was demolished in 1881 and replaced with the Panorama Marigny which was converted into the [[Théâtre Marigny]] in 1893.

==Salle Lacaze==
The first recorded entertainment use of the site dates to 1835, when a showman set up attractions at the Marigny junction. After the [[French Revolution of 1848]] a small theatre called the Salle Lacaze was built for a magician named Lacaze.&lt;ref&gt;Levin 2009, p. 401, identifies the theatre as the "Salle Lacaze". Yon 2000, p. 111, describes it as a "petit théâtre de magie que le 'physicien' Lacaze a rouvert..." ("little theatre of magic that the 'conjurer' Lacaze opened..."). In this context, "physicien" has been translated as "conjurer"; see Faris, p. 48; Kracauer 2002, p. 166; Spiers 1908 (''A New French-English General Dictionary''), [https://books.google.com/books?id=zSJXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=conjurer+OR+conjurer+physicien+intitle:french+intitle:dictionary&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UidMTrbzJsXfiAKewMSpAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=physicien&amp;f=false p. 537]. "Conjurer" is chiefly a British term, meaning "magician".&lt;/ref&gt;
It was a summer theatre, and in it he presented "legerdemain and amusing physical representations."&lt;ref&gt;Galignani 1852, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xQUoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA495#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 495].&lt;/ref&gt; His theatre was also known as the '''Château d'Enfer''' (Castle of the Underworld).&lt;ref&gt;Duneton 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8w4JAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Château+d'Enfer%22&amp;dq=%22Château+d'Enfer%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DwxLTreUCuPiiALT5tyhBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBTgU p. 921].&lt;/ref&gt;
Lacaze began losing money, and sometime after 1852 he closed down.

==Bouffes-Parisiens==
[[File:Champs-Élysées, Palais de l'Industrie, Salle Lacaze, Cirque de l'Impératrice 1855 - Yon 2000pla27.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|View of the [[:en:Palais de l'Industrie|Palais de l'Industrie]] on the far side the Champs-Élysées and the Carré Marigny with the [[Cirque de l'Impératrice]] at the front slightly left of center and the small Salle Lacaze (the first theatre of Offenbach's [[:en:Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens|Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens]]) across the square at the left]]

In the spring of 1855 the composer [[Jacques Offenbach]] decided that the position of this modest wooden theatre was perfectly situated on the [[Carré Marigny]] to catch overspill traffic from the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Universal Exposition of 1855]]; after some modifications to the site he opened the [[Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens]] on 5 July 1855.  The theatre had a capacity of only 300 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb 1992, p. 653, gives the capacity of the Salle Lacaze as 300. Gammond 1980, p. 37, says it had a seating capacity of 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the inaugural performance, Offenbach conducted four of his own works, the last of which was ''[[Les deux aveugles]]'', a one-act ''bouffonerie musicale'' about two swindling "blind" Parisian beggars.  This little piece soon acquired an international reputation due to visitors from the Exposition and due to some controversy over its subject matter.  Another notable premiere that summer was ''[[Le violoneux]]''.  Further performances in the summer of 1855 were primarily of satirical sketches which only included a few musical numbers. The season, however, was so successful that Offenbach was able to resign his position as conductor of the [[Théâtre Français]].&lt;ref&gt;Faris 1980, pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;  This theatre was soon renamed Bouffes d'Été, as during the winter Offenbach directed the Bouffes d'Hiver in the [[Salle Choiseul]] on the rue Monsigny.  The company also used the Salle Lacaze for the 1856, 1857, and 1859 summer seasons, and a total of 16 Offenbach pieces were premiered here by the Bouffes-Parisiens.&lt;ref&gt;Yon 2000, pp. 760–762.&lt;/ref&gt;

Offenbach sublet the hall to the mime [[Charles Deburau]] in 1858&lt;ref&gt;Yon 2000, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; for one unsuccessful summer season (5 June to 14 October), when it was known as the '''Théâtre Deburau'''&lt;ref name=Lecomte23&gt;Lecomte 1905, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TKk-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA22 p. 23].&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Bouffes-Deburau'''.&lt;ref name=Ganzl915&gt;Gänzl 2001, p. 915.&lt;/ref&gt; Deburau's season included the premieres of three 1-act pieces with music by [[Hervé (composer)|Hervé]]: ''Le voiturier'' (3&amp;nbsp;September), ''La belle espagnole'' (22&amp;nbsp;September), and ''Simple histoire'' (10&amp;nbsp;October).&lt;ref name=Ganzl915/&gt;

After Deburau, the theatre was again used by the Bouffes-Parisiens (1859). During the summer of 1860 Offenbach's company performed in Brusssels in June, while Offenbach himself went to Berlin to conduct the Berlin premiere of ''[[Orphée aux enfers]]'', and from July to early August the company performed in Lyon, leaving the Salle Lacaze empty.&lt;ref&gt;Yon 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation enacted in March 1861 prevented the Bouffes-Parisiens from continuing to use both theatres, and their appearances at the Salle Lacaze were discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;Levin 2009, p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Théâtre Féerique==
On 1 January 1861 Raignard, inventor of a novel system of décors and tricks, applied for permission to use the theatre for presentations between 2 and 5 p.m. at reduced prices targeted at the "numerous persons of a variable population", whose occupations and limited means kept them from attending the theatre in the evening. He also intended it to help young authors, composers, and actors. By a ministerial order of 5 February his repertory was limited to one- and two-act ''[[comédies-vaudevilles]]'' and operettas (with at most 5 characters) and one- and two-act ''[[féeries]]'' (melodramas with magic) with tableaus, choruses, and dances. Performances were given under the name '''Théâtre Féerique des Champs-Élysées''' or '''Petit Théâtre Féerique des Champs-Élysées'''. After the failure of this enterprise, the director was dismissed by a decree of 3 August 1861, and on 7 August a second decree authorized the artists to continue performances as a society under the direction of Octave Guillier. This effort was abandoned, however, by 31 August.&lt;ref&gt;Wild 1989, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was next used by [[Charles Bridault]], who brought his '''Théâtre du Châlet des Îles''' in. This troupe had previously performed in the [[Bois de Boulogne]] from 13 June to 31 August. Their run of performances on the Champs-Élysées was short, however, only lasting from 3 to 10 September.&lt;ref&gt;Wild 1989, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Théâtre des Champs-Élysées==
The theatre was next acquired by [[Céleste Mogador]] (Mme Lionel de Chabrillan), who had it renovated and rechristened as the '''Théâtre des Champs-Élysées''' (not to be confused with the later [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] on the avenue Montaigne). She gave its direction to Eugène Audray-Deshorties, who received his authorization on 20 January 1862 and reopened the theatre on 19 April. His repertory was confined to one-, two-, and three-act ''comédies'' and ''vaudevilles'' (with ''[[intermèdes]]'' of song and dance) and operettas of one act, and was mainly borrowed from the [[Folies-Dramatiques]] (from the [[Boulevard du Temple]]), the Bouffes-Parisiens, and the [[Variétés]]. Due to poor management, he retired in September, and the theatre was rented to the troupe of the Folies-Dramatiques from 14 September to 6 November. Mme Chabrillan took over again in 1863. She applied for permission to open a café, with vocal concerts inside and instrumental concerts outside on the terrace, and provisionally entrusted its direction to Auguste Armand Bourgoin, who began on 22 June 1863. The theatre was sold to Louis-Émile Hesnard (the actor known as [[Montrouge (actor)|Montrouge]]) on 27 February 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Wild 1989, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folies-Marigny==

[[Montrouge (actor)|Montrouge]] and his future wife [[Marguerite Macé-Montrouge|Mlle Macé]], turned it into a popular success as the '''Théâtre des Folies-Marigny''' (26 March 1864).&lt;ref&gt;Lecomte 1905, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TKk-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA28 p. 28].&lt;/ref&gt;
Several early operettas of [[Charles Lecocq]] were performed here. The tenor [[Achille-Félix Montaubry]], who had formerly performed at the [[Opéra-Comique]] but had experienced a decline in the allure of his voice, purchased the Folies-Marigny in 1868, and produced an operetta of his own composition called ''Horace''.&lt;ref&gt;Fétis 1881, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cu45AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA234#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 234].&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 1870 the theatre was taken over by Leduc.&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical World'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=VJMPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA289#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false (23 April 1870), p. 289].&lt;/ref&gt;
The last performance was in April 1881, and shortly thereafter it was demolished, to be replaced with a panorama designed by the architect [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]]. In 1893 Garnier's panorama was converted by the architect [[Édouard Niermans (architect)|Édouard Niermans]] into a new theatre, which opened on 22 January 1896 under the name Folies-Marigny, but this was soon shortened to Marigny-Théâtre or [[Théâtre Marigny]].&lt;ref&gt;Lecomte 1905, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TKk-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA28 28], [https://books.google.com/books?id=TKk-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA39 39].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Toronto International Film Festival''' ('''TIFF''', often stylized as '''tiff''') is one of the largest publicly attended [[film festival]]s in the world, attracting over 480,000 people annually. Since its founding in 1976, TIFF has grown to become a permanent destination for film culture operating out of the [[TIFF Bell Lightbox]], located in [[downtown Toronto]].

Year-round, the TIFF Bell Lightbox offers screenings, lectures, discussions, festivals, workshops, industry support, and the chance to meet filmmakers from Canada and around the world. TIFF Bell Lightbox is located on the north west corner of King Street and John Street in downtown Toronto.

In 2016, 397 films from 83 countries were screened at 28 screens in downtown Toronto venues, welcoming an estimated 480,000 attendees, over 5,000 of whom were industry professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://assets.contentful.com/22n7d68fswlw/3vWZvCErh6wWsq2kAkgySS/bcccc1803d208be54a3379c6c1cd38ac/Festival_Fact_Sheet_2016_.pdf|title=2016 TORONTO INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL FACT SHEET|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024161741/http://assets.contentful.com/22n7d68fswlw/3vWZvCErh6wWsq2kAkgySS/bcccc1803d208be54a3379c6c1cd38ac/Festival_Fact_Sheet_2016_.pdf|archive-date=October 24, 2016|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; TIFF starts the Thursday night after Labour Day (the first Monday in September in Canada) and lasts for eleven days.

==Background==
The Toronto International Film Festival was first launched as the '''Toronto Festival of Festivals''', collecting the best films from other film festivals around the world and showing them to eager audiences in Toronto. Founded by [[Bill Marshall (producer)|Bill Marshall]], [[Dusty Cohl]], and [[Henk Van der Kolk]],&lt;ref name=tstar&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Goffin |title=TIFF co-founder Bill Marshall, 77, remembered as pioneer of Canadian film |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2017/01/01/tiff-co-founder-bill-marshall-77-remembered-as-pioneer-of-canadian-film.html |work=[[Toronto Star]] |publisher= |date=January 1, 2017 |accessdate=January 3, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102173841/https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2017/01/01/tiff-co-founder-bill-marshall-77-remembered-as-pioneer-of-canadian-film.html |archivedate=January 2, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the inaugural event took place from October 18 through 24, 1976. That first year, 35,000 filmgoers watched 127 films from 30 countries presented in ten programmes. [[Piers Handling]] has been the festival's director and CEO since 1994, while [[Noah Cowan]] became co-director of TIFF in 2004. In late 2007, Cowan became the artistic director of [[TIFF Bell Lightbox]], while longtime programmer [[Cameron Bailey]] succeeded as co-director. As of 2013, Bailey is now the artistic director of the Toronto International Film Festival, as well as TIFF Bell Lightbox's year round programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/03/14/cameron-bailey-named-artistic-director-of-toronto-international-film-festival/ "Cameron Bailey named artistic director of Toronto International Film Festival"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150121000908/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/03/14/cameron-bailey-named-artistic-director-of-toronto-international-film-festival/ |date=January 21, 2015 }}. ''[[National Post]]'', March 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

TIFF was once centred on the [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]] neighbourhood, but the [[Toronto Entertainment District]] later gained a greater level of prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.thestar.com/article/851243 |work = [[Toronto Star]] |first = Raju |last = Mudhar |date = August 25, 2010 |accessdate = September 7, 2010 |title = From mega clubs to mega culture in Entertainment District |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100831074356/http://www.thestar.com/article/851243 |archivedate = August 31, 2010 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.toronto.com/article/696280?bn=1 |work = [[Toronto Star]] |first = Kate |last = Allen |date = August 24, 2011 |accessdate = August 25, 2011 |title = TIFF's great migration |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120323021413/http://www.toronto.com/article/696280?bn=1 |archivedate = March 23, 2012 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- As of 2013, TIFF maintains extensive connections with the Yorkville area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; TIFF is known for the celebrity buzz it brings to the area with international media setting up near its restaurants and stores for photos and interviews with the stars. In 2010, TIFF opened its permanent headquarters, TIFF Bell Lightbox, a year-round home for the appreciation of film in the heart of downtown Toronto.

TIFF has grown, steadily adding initiatives throughout the years. TIFF Cinematheque (formerly Cinematheque Ontario) and the Film Reference Library (FRL) opened in 1990. The TIFF Kids International Film Festival (formerly Sprockets) launched in 1998. Film Circuit began exhibiting independent and Canadian films in under-serviced cities across Canada in 1994.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following, TIFF continued to concentrate on bringing the best films from around the world.{{Citation needed|date = September 2010}} Through consistent investment and promotion by its organisers and sponsors, the Toronto International Film Festival has also grown to become a vital component of [[Hollywood]]'s marketing machine.{{Citation needed|date = September 2010}}

In 1994, the decision was made to replace the name "Festival of Festivals" with "Toronto International Film Festival". From 1994 to 2009, the umbrella organization running TIFF was named "Toronto International Film Festival Group" (TIFFG). In 2009, the umbrella organization TIFFG was renamed to TIFF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.torontointernationalfilmfestival.ca/abouttiff/organization/tiffhistory |title = TIFF History |accessdate = September 21, 2010 |publisher = Toronto International Film Festival |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100825030348/http://www.torontointernationalfilmfestival.ca/abouttiff/organization/tiffhistory |archivedate = August 25, 2010 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Perspective Canada, the programme that had focused on Canadian films since 1984, was replaced by two programmes:
* Canada First!, a forum for Canadian filmmakers presenting their first feature-length work, featuring eight to 15 films, and
* Short Cuts Canada, which includes 30-40 Canadian [[short film]]s.

In 2004, TIFF was featured as the site of murder mystery in the film ''[[Jiminy Glick in Lalawood]]'', a comedy film starring [[Martin Short]].

In 2007, it was announced that the organization generates an estimated annual impact of $67 million CAD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|work = [[Ontario Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport]]|date = September 7, 2007|title = McGuinty government helps promote Toronto International Film Festival|url = http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/47437/mcguinty-government-helps-promote-toronto-international-film-festival|accessdate = September 10, 2012|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130117004200/http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/47437/mcguinty-government-helps-promote-toronto-international-film-festival|archivedate = January 17, 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, that benefit had grown to $170 million CAD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url = http://tiff.net/press/pressreleases/2011/festival-announces |publisher = Toronto International Film Festival |date = August 16, 2011 |title = Festival Announces Boundary-Pushing Visions Titles |accessdate = August 25, 2011 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110912052928/http://tiff.net/press/pressreleases/2011/festival-announces |archivedate = September 12, 2011 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Rose McGowan]] caused controversy at a TIFF press conference for her film ''[[Fifty Dead Men Walking]]'', when she noted that "I imagine, had I grown up in Belfast, I would 100% have been in the IRA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/director-apologises-for-rose-mcgowans-ira-comments-13978481.html |work = [[Belfast Telegraph]] |date = 2008–2011|title = Director apologises for Rose McGowan's IRA comments|author = The Globe and Mail|agency = Phillip Crawley, Publisher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable film premieres===
Films such as ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'', ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]'', ''[[Mr. Nobody (film)|Mr. Nobody]]'', ''[[127 Hours]]'', ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]'', ''[[The Five Obstructions]]'', ''[[Singapore Sling (1990 film)|Singapore Sling]]'', and ''[[I Am Love (film)|I Am Love]]'' have premiered at TIFF. [[Jamie Foxx]]'s portrayal of [[Ray Charles]] ultimately won him the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] while ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' went on to win eight Oscars at the 2009 Academy Awards. ''[[Precious (film)|Precious]]'', which won the 2009 TIFF People's Choice Award, went on to win two Oscars at the 82nd Academy Awards. ''[[The King's Speech]]'', the winner of the 2010 TIFF People's Choice Award, won four Oscars at the 83rd Academy Awards, while ''[[Silver Linings Playbook]]'', the winner of the 2012 TIFF People's Choice Award, went on to win the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for [[Jennifer Lawrence]].

Many Hollywood studios premiere their films in Toronto due to TIFF's easy-going non-competitive nature, relatively inexpensive costs (when compared to European festivals), eager film-fluent audiences and convenient timing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===TIFF Bell Lightbox===
[[File:Lightbox 2010-09-11 II.JPG|thumb|[[TIFF Bell Lightbox]]]]
In 2007, the Festival Group began construction on [[TIFF Bell Lightbox]], a new facility at the corner of King and John Streets in downtown Toronto, on land donated by [[Ivan Reitman]] and family. The $181 million facility is named for founding sponsor [[Bell Canada]], with additional support from the [[Government of Ontario]] and [[Government of Canada]].

In 2010, the organization opened its new headquarters at TIFF Bell Lightbox. The facility, designed by local firm [[KPMB Architects]], provides extensive year-round galleries, cinemas, archives and activities for cinephiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/tiff/interviews-and-features/article1702853.ece | location = Toronto | work = [[The Globe and Mail]] | first = Guy | last = Dixon | title = Lightbox aims to draw filmmakers to its facilities - The Globe and Mail | date = September 9, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The five-storey facility contains five cinemas, two gallery spaces, film archives and an extensive reference library, study spaces, film lab facility, and a research centre. There is also a gift shop, two restaurants, a lounge, a cafe, and a three-storey atrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Let there be lightbox|url = http://www.nowtoronto.com/movies/story.cfm?content=176653|accessdate = August 17, 2012|work = NOW|date = September 9–16, 2010|author = Norman Wilner|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130117004724/http://www.nowtoronto.com/movies/story.cfm?content=176653|archivedate = January 17, 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperatively with Daniels Corporation, there is a 46-storey condominium atop, called the Festival Tower.

The first film screening was [[Bruce McDonald (director)|Bruce McDonald]]'s ''[[Trigger (film)|Trigger]]''. The first exhibition was a retrospective on [[Tim Burton]], organized by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (New York). Subsequent exhibitions include Fellini: Spectacular Obsessions, Grace Kelly: From Movie Star to Princess, Designing 007: 50 Years of Bond Style, and [[Stanley Kubrick]]: The Exhibition, all of which were organized by TIFF, as well as one called ''Essential Cinema'', featuring posters, images and props from TIFF's ''The Essential 100'' list of films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = No place like home: Toronto film fest opens new HQ|url = http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/sep/09/no-place-like-home-toronto-film-fest-opens-new-hq/|accessdate = September 16, 2012|work = U-T San Diego News|date = September 9, 2010|first = David|last = Germain|agency = The San Diego Union-Tribune, LLC|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130117004159/http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/sep/09/no-place-like-home-toronto-film-fest-opens-new-hq/|archivedate = January 17, 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = A look at the Stanley Kubrick Exhibition TIFF 2014|url = http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2014/11/27/stanley-kubrick-tiff-2014/|accessdate = August 3, 2015|work = [[The Vancouver Sun]]|date = November 27, 2014|agency = Canoe Sun Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Film Reference Library]] (FRL) is a large Canadian film research collection. The library is a free resource for film lovers, filmmakers, students, scholars, and journalists, and is located on the fourth floor of the TIFF Bell Lightbox. An affiliate member of the [[International Federation of Film Archives|International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF)]], the FRL promotes Canadian and global film scholarship by collecting, preserving, and providing access to a comprehensive collection of film prints, and film-related reference resources (including books, periodicals, scripts, research files, movies, press kits, and about 80 special collections.

In 2016, the festival received a donation of 1,400 film prints, and launched a campaign to raise money for the preservation and storage of the films.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pressreader.com/canada/toronto-star/20161116/282033326780443 "TIFF gains cach of 1,400 film prints"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117065918/https://www.pressreader.com/canada/toronto-star/20161116/282033326780443 |date=November 17, 2016 }}.

===Canada's Top Ten===
Each year, TIFF also releases a list of the films selected by festival programmers as the ten best Canadian feature and short films of the year, regardless of whether or not they were screened at TIFF.&lt;ref name=topten&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/tiff-reveals-canadas-top-ten-film-festival-line-up/article27649543/ "TIFF reveals Canada’s Top Ten Film Festival line-up"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222182936/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/tiff-reveals-canadas-top-ten-film-festival-line-up/article27649543/ |date=December 22, 2015 }}. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', December 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The films selected are announced in December each year, and are screened at a smaller follow-up festival at the Lightbox the following January;&lt;ref name = topten /&gt; a People's Choice Award is then presented for that minifestival as well.

Since 1984, every decade TIFF has also produced a [[Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time]] list. This list is produced from a wider poll of film industry professionals and academics throughout Canada, separately from the annual top-ten list.

==Awards==
The festival's major prize, the [[Toronto International Film Festival People's Choice Award|People's Choice Award]], is given to a feature-length film. It is not a juried prize, but is given to the film with the highest ratings as voted by the TIFF-going populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Each of the People's Choice Awards names first and second runners-up in addition to the winners.

However, TIFF does present juried awards in some other categories. The festival presents three major awards for Canadian films: [[Toronto International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian Film|Best Canadian Film]], [[Toronto International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian First Feature Film|Best Canadian First Feature Film]], and [[Toronto International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian Short Film|Best Canadian Short Film]], as well as international awards for Best Short Film, two [[FIPRESCI]]-sponsored Special Presentation and Discovery awards for international films, and a [[NETPAC]]-sponsored award for the best film from [[Asia]] having its world premiere at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2015, the festival introduced Platform, a juried programme that champions director’s cinema from around the world; one film from the stream is selected as the winner of the [[Platform Prize]].

For all of the juried awards, [[honorable mention]]s may also be given, although the juries are expected to select one overall winner.

==Sections==
The hundreds of films screened at the annual festival are divided into sections (referred to by TIFF as "Programmes") based on genre (e.g. [[documentary]], [[children's film]]s), format (e.g. [[short films]], [[television episode]]s), the status of filmmaker (e.g. "masters", first-time directors), and so forth. Up until the early 2010s there were sections reserved for Canadian films, but beginning in 2015 all Canadian films are integrated in sections with films from outside Canada.

Currently the festival's 14 sections are as follows:&lt;ref name=TIFF2017sections/&gt;
* Contemporary World Cinema: [[narrative film|narrative]] feature films generally by directors who are established but not famous
* Discovery: films that are typically the director's first or second [[feature film]]
* Gala Presentations: high-profile feature films, often featuring international movie stars, presented with a [[red carpet]]
* In Conversation With...: interviews of a director or other figure from the film industry, generally accompanied by brief excerpts from films (up until the [[2014 Toronto International Film Festival|2014 festival]], this section was called "Mavericks")
* Masters: feature films by "the world's most influential [[art-house]] filmmakers"
* Midnight Madness: [[genre film]]s (traditionally at TIFF each film in this section has one screening scheduled for 11:59pm and another the following afternoon); the section was launched at TIFF in 1988 and was programmed by Colin Geddes from 1998 to 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/02/tiff-programmer-colin-geddes-steps-down-toronto-international-film-festival-1201778911/ |work=IndieWire |title=TIFF Programmer Colin Geddes Departing After 20 Years |author=Graham Winfrey |date=February 7, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225210306/http://www.indiewire.com/2017/02/tiff-programmer-colin-geddes-steps-down-toronto-international-film-festival-1201778911/ |archivedate=February 25, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; now programmed by Peter Kuplowsky

* Primetime: television episodes making either their world premiere or North American premiere projected cinematically; this section was launched in 2015
* Short Cuts: a section of [[short films]] (usually six to ten short films included at each screening) both Canadian and international; up until [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival|the 2013 festival]] only Canadian short films were screened and the section was called Short Cuts Canada, in [[2014 Toronto International Film Festival|2014]] a new section called Short Cuts International was added, and then in 2015 they were merged into a section called Short Cuts
* Special Presentations: high-profile feature films, usually Canadian premieres if not [[premiere|world premieres]]
* TIFF Cinematheque: unlike the other sections which present new films, the TIFF Cinematheque section has films from all eras of cinema, often classic films that have been newly [[film preservation|restored]]
* TIFF Docs (formerly called Reel to Reel): [[documentary]] films
* TIFF Kids and TIFF Next Wave (formerly called Sprockets): films for children and teenagers
* Wavelengths: [[experimental film]]s and [[art film]]s, both feature-length and shorts (this section was named for [[Michael Snow]]'s film ''[[Wavelength (1967 film)|Wavelength]]'')

'''''Umanità Nova''''' is an [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchist]] newspaper founded in 1920.

It was published daily until 1922, when it was shut down by the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|fascist regime]]. In some places its circulation exceeded that of the socialist paper ''[[Avanti! (Italian newspaper)|Avanti!]]''.  Upon the fall of the regime in 1945, publication began again, this time as a weekly.

The paper continues today and ''Umanità Nova'' is the mouthpiece of the [[Italian Anarchist Federation]].

Contributors to ''Umanità Nova'' include its founders, [[Errico Malatesta]] and [[Antonio Cieri]]; [[Camillo Berneri]], [[Armando Borghi]], and [[Carlo Frigerio (anarchist)|Carlo Frigerio]].

==History==

===Early years===
The paper was begun in 1909, by [[Ettore Molinari]] and [[Nella Giacomelli]], who thought to turn the pamphlet "[[La Protesta Umana|Human Protest]]" (La Protesta Umana) into a daily journal.  During a national convention in 1911, the [[Fascio Comunista Anarchico di Roma|Rome Anarchist Communist Group]] proposed a national outlet to reach the movement outside the country, and in turn reinforce it within Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Schirone, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 1919, a large gathering of Italian anarchists, both organizationalists and individualists, attended a national convention in Florence, and agreed upon the need to close ranks and form a union together: the [[Union of Anarchist Communist of Italy|Italian Anarchist Communist Union]].  One of the main resolutions was to print a paper,&lt;ref&gt;Schirone, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and when Molinari and Giacomelli proposed it be published as a national daily, they and [[Emilio Spinaci]] were given the responsibility of determining whether it was possible to accomplish the feat of getting all the anarchists together, and began gathering the funds.

Nella Giacomelli gave the paper its present name, saying,
{{quote|" 'Umanità Nova' is the title of the anarchist daily we are planning &amp;mdash; a mild name, almost evangelical, out of tune, some say, with the quick breath of a society in turmoil, with the jolting events, the threat of violent action and the bold daring of this time that we live in. [....] Umanità Nova! : it embraces the full meaning of our highest hopes, and it sets a path to follow without fail. [....] We are setting out for the inevitable. The revolution is no longer a dream; libertarian communism is an achievable goal; the anarchic ideal is no longer a utopia.  The cry of the masses, pouring from the workshops, and the salt of endless, fertile fields, represents the greatest human protest against secular human suffering; Spartacus is about to break his chains; many consciousnesses will rise up to renew the world.  Umanità Nova, the supreme goal of all our battles and our pain, we adopt you as a shining symbol of a living vision, and we raise you up to the masses, to all our hearts, to the lantern and the flag of light and freedom."}}

Due to a blockade of the funds, delays in the post and a decree placing a quota on paper, to the downfall of new journals, publication was only possible thanks to an intervention by the workers of the lignite caves of Valdarno who supplied the energy for paper-mills, sending word that they would refuse to make any more deliveries until there was a guarantee to supply paper to ''Umanità Nova''.  October 9, 1919 a notice was printed that the daily paper would be prepared, and funds began to arrive: about 200,000 lira were dedicated to bring it to life.  So, on February 26, 1920 the first issue of ''Umanità Nova'' was released, an evening edition of four pages, ten cents cover price.  9,000 copies of the first edition grew to 40,000 within a month, and 50,000 in a heated moment, and if more weren't printed it was only because of the lack of paper.&lt;ref&gt;''Umanità Nova'', v. I, n. 1 p. 1, February 26–27, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; Its cash pool exceeded a million lira.

The enormous success reflected not only on the anarchist movement, but on a vast segment of the left which was now contiguous with the movement and would remain so for several months, until the failure of the [[occupation of factories|factory occupations]], which happened to turn it away.  The bold, political line the anarchists held in their struggle helped them grow in terms of numbers and importance.  If the Congress of Florence in 1919 had 145 in attendance in July 1920, the meeting in [[Bologna]] attracted about 700.  In the syndicalist camp, the [[Italian Syndicalist Union]] (USI) went from 58,000 members by the end of 1919 to more than 180,000 in the first half of 1919 and to 300,000 the following year.  Among the Confederation, the anarchists succeeded in taking the key administrative reformists such as the [[Federazione Impiegati Operai Metallurgici|FIOM]] of [[Turin]], with [[Pietro Ferrero]] and [[Maurizio Garino]].  It was a magical moment for Italian anarchism, to which the daily contributed more than a bit.  This great efficacy was shown furthermore in the course of the imposing "factory occupation" movement among the workers.  Just scroll through the pages of the newspaper in September 1920, to get an idea of how active anarchists were in the occupied factories and workshops, managed by their workers.  Repression was not long in coming, and in October, almost the entire editorship of "Umanità Nova" was arrested, in the hundreds of arrests and searches carried out all across Italy, against anarchists and revolutionary syndicalists.  Immediately following that, the [[Italian Syndicalist Union|USI]] was beheaded by the arrest of the entire General Council.

The police, however, could not figure out how the newspaper was still issued every day, with its editors in jail.  The dragnet had not captured [[Gigi Damiani]], who contacted individuals who had gone underground and avoided the wave of repression, and who had created a network which allowed it to move continuously.  The newspaper was compiled this way, eventually reaching [[Milan]] where it was published regularly.

=== Censorship, harassment, and closure ===
On February 29, 1920 there was a rally in Milan, in the [[Porta Romana (Milan)|Porta Romana]] school gym, organized by the Proletarian League of injured and disabled veterans.  Leftists and trade unionists took part, including the anarchist Errico Malatesta, and [[Pasquale Binazzi]] and Armando Borghi's [[Italian Syndicalist Union]] (USI).  The peaceful demonstration turned out to be a tragic anticipation of the fascist attack squads in the two years which followed.   Protesters were repeatedly charged by the police, who fired on a train carrying demonstrators and killed two, wounding five others.  With fascists supporting the ordinary police forces, the number of leaders in the anarchist movement shrank from 28 in 1921 to 3 in 1926.  The history of ''Umanità Nova'' &amp;mdash; its daily publication in Milan interrupted by the [[Diana theater bombing|Diana]] event, moving to Rome where it became weekly and irregular until its final closure in 1922 &amp;mdash; is thoroughly documented in a special dossier of the Directorate-General of Public Security.  It began as an ambitious publishing accomplishment led by Malatesta, having a hugely successful subscription drive leading up to its first issue (135,000 lira of "funds collected in the Kingdom" by January 1920), and copies reserved in advance (6 lira for 100 copies), then the promotion, lotteries and house parties, and the establishment of "Committees for Umanità Nova" everywhere.  The final act came when the police headquarters in Rome filed a complaint against twenty former editors, correspondents, and members of the board of directors of ''Umanità Nova''.  A large pile of correspondence, pamphlets and propaganda were seized, and the newspaper's assets taken: 5,700 lira, 300 marks, 20,000 crowns and a checking account at [[Credito Italiano]] with 71,328 lira available, plus all their records.  A similar situation took place in [[La Spezia]], where the [[Blackshirts]] had destroyed the printing press and burned the offices of ''[[Il Libertario]]'', and with ''[[L'Avvenire Anarchico]]'' in [[Pisa]].  On October 28, 1922, the king [[Vittorio Emanuele III]] entrusted [[Benito Mussolini]] with the "task of forming a new government".  ''Umanità Nova'' has this to say about his decision to give power to the executive head of the blackshirts:&lt;ref&gt;Schirone, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The bourgeoisie, threatened by the rising sea of workers, incapable of solving the urgent problems of war, and powerless to defend themselves with traditional methods of legal repression, saw themselves as lost, and greeted with joy a soldier who was proclaimed dictator and who had drowned every attempted uprising in blood." | "The Parliamentary Swindle", July 21, 1922.&lt;ref&gt;''Umanità Nova'', v. III, n. 167 p. 1, July 21, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Umanità Nova'' also places responsibility on the socialists for helping the fascists' political ascent:&lt;ref&gt;Schirone, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The rise of fascism should serve as a lesson to the legislative socialists, who believed and &amp;mdash; alas! &amp;mdash; still believe that we can overthrow the bourgeoise with the votes of 51% of the electorate, and they would not believe us when we told them that should they ever achieve the parliamentary majority they so desired (just to make the absurd point: a socialist parliament), they would have gotten their asses kicked! | "Mussolini gains power", November 25, 1922.&lt;ref&gt;''Umanità Nova'', v. III, n. 195 p. 1, November 25, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Immediately following the [[March on Rome|fascist occupation of Rome]], on October 30, 1922, the offices on Via Santa Croce in Milan were invaded and destroyed.  After three weeks of forced silence, on November 22 they found a printer willing to publish the paper, and while the devastating fury of the blackshirts raged, issue number 196 of ''Umanità Nova'' was released.  It would be the last.&lt;ref&gt;Schirone, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New beginnings, abroad ===
The Italian experiment ended by force, ''Umanità Nova'' was reborn in [[Brooklyn]], USA between 1924-25&lt;ref&gt;Bettini, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;  Eighteen issues were published under the new editor [[Maris Baldini]], a publicist.  There are passionate articles about the fight against fascism, and the campaign to free [[Sacco and Vanzetti]].  Many interventions and analyses appeared on the Italian situation and on the role of anarchists in this phase: some important and interesting writings by Camillo da Lodi (a pseudonym of Camillo Berneri), A. Borghi, Luigi Fabbri, and others.  The American edition of the journal immediately found a large following among exile communities, and the first issues sold out completely.  Two special issues of ''Umanità Nova'' were published in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1930 and 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Bettini, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  From October 20, 1932 to April 15, 1933, ten issues were published from [[Puteaux]]:&lt;ref&gt;Bettini, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Camillo Berneri and Antonio Cieri, and a number of free exiles, are the architects of the journal's rebirth as a biweekly, and its trajectory is a history of repression by French authorities.  The international scope of ''Umanità Nova'' reaches Russia and Spain in particular, in its new social environment the paper entered a new phase, its authors desired that it become a paper with international horizons, opening a window onto workers' struggles in each country.  The first months of 1933 are full of events of international importance.  In January there was an anarchist uprising in Spain, which ended in the arrest, torture, and assassination of rebels in the [[Iberian Anarchist Federation]], and in Germany, Hitler came to power, resulting in censorship of the press, restriction of the freedom of association, and repression of the Nazi's opponents.  At this moment of critical social importance to the exiles, France ordered ''Umanità Nova'' to be shut down again.  Only three issues of ''La Protesta'' exist, the last is dated March 28, 1933.  The newspaper appeared again, illegally, in Italy in 1943, fulfilling the dream of Camillo Berneri.

=== World War II and Resistance ===
After ten years of forced silence, ''Umanità Nova'' was published by the underground once again, under the title "Risorgiamo" (Resurrection), on September 10, 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Schirone, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;  Between September 1943 and October 1944, articles were written not simple with only the intention of forming solidarity with oppressed subjects, but with the political purpose of urging a fight against fascism.  The warning to "concede nothing" in the [[Italian resistance movement|partisan]] fight came from this open letter to women, almost a political manifesto:

{{quote|And to succeed in this battle, we will fight alongside men, never conceding anything, never yielding, so that our children can live in a time in which men can truly be men.}}

Reestablishment of political parties, demonstrations, and freedom of the press continued to be banned and repressed.  The mood engendered by these circumstances and the growing demands of workers returning from the war, in the great strikes that had closed factories in [[Naples]] from August 17–20, 1943, just before the city [[Four days of Naples|successfully resisted]] the Nazi occupation, can be read in anti-fascist papers, from the communist ''[[l'Unità]]'' to the socialist ''[[Avanti! (Italian newspaper)|Avanti!]]'', from the [[Action Party (Italy)|actionist]] ''[[L'Italia libera]]'' to the anarchist ''Umanità Nova''.&lt;ref&gt;Schirone, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Additional concrete suggestions and analysis appears in the article "Fascists and Nazis at work", interesting because it turns the favorite formula of treason used by Nazi propaganda on its head:

{{quote|The Fascist leadership, responsible for the ruin of Italy, taking advantage of the weakness of the [[Pietro Badoglio|Badoglio]] government, have taken refuge in Germany among their worthy comrades, the Nazis, murderers of the German people, and from there come radio instructions ordering the Italian squads to aid the [occupying] Germans in any way, with the goal of helping Fascism to take power again [...]  There is no historical example of a more vile treachery against the Italian people, who are reduced to homelessness and complete loss.|"Fascists and Nazis at work", ''Umanità Nova''}}

After the collapse of Fascism in July 1943, and the [[Armistice with Italy|Armistice]] that September, the [[Italian Anarchist Federation]] (FAI) took over management and publication of the paper, and it took on many of the characteristics of that group's [[libertarianism|libertarian]] philosophy: internal organization is not absolute and rigid, but is shaped by the mandates of a congress, who also establish the editorial motifs; an extensive network of frequent collaborators is recognized, any of its readers can have an exchange with the paper, with the effect that a substantial number of articles are published by very occasional collaborators; there is absolute freedom to choose the topic to be covered; distribution is left largely to the talents of militants. The circulation data is interesting, although quite difficult to reconstruct.  The paper's spread was closely related to the native anarchist movement in each area, and to the different phases of the evolving Italian political and social situation.  With some guesswork, we see that circulation rose from 13,000 in 1944, to an average of 15-16,000 copies per issue, up to a peak of 18,000, reached in 1946, then gradually decreasing to 10,000-10,500 copies in the early 1950s.  Approximately 60% of revenue was from direct sales, while subscriptions accounted for at most 15%.  The range of its greatest distribution were historically more consolidated: [[Tuscany]], [[Lazio]], and [[Emilia-Romagna]].

=== Present ===
The editorship and management are currently appointed by a congress of the FAI, and its members rotate every three years unless there are exceptional circumstances.  The rotation of offices, used for every post in the FAI, helps prevent any concentration of power.  ''Umanità Nova'' is printed weekly at a shop in self-managed Carrara, and distributed throughout Italy, among anarchist groups and headquarters, libraries, community centers, newsstands and bookstores, and also abroad.  A complete list of outlets can be found on the magazine's website. It is also distributed in pdf format.

The newspaper is a weekly issue and publishes around 35 issues per year. Its articles covers the themes of workers struggles, antimilitarism, feminism, social-ecologism, antispecism and internationalism. Umanità Nova also publishes translations from foreign anarchist websites and newspaper, most notably from Le Monde Libertaire (France), LibCom.org, Crimethinc.org, Tierra y Libertad (Spain) and Meydan (Turkey). On the occasion of international anarchist and anarcho-sindacalists meetings and congress the newspaper covers the events with long-form articles and interviews of members of others organizations.

It hosts thematic debates which are developed in a number of issues, about political and more theoretical question. The editorial board is known, in Italian anarchist milieu, for its hardcore scientific, classist, internationalist and anti-primitivist wiews, which lead to a number of polemics with "anarcho"-primitivist and "post anarchist" groups and individuals.

(1938). ''Sexual anomalies and perversions: Physical and psychological development, diagnosis and treatment'' (new and revised edition). London: Encyclopaedic Press.{{Page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term comes from the French ''voir'' which means "to see". A male voyeur is commonly labelled as "Peeping Tom" or a "Jags", a term which originates from the [[Lady Godiva]] legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|DNB|1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that term is usually applied to a male who observes somebody secretly and, generally, not in a [[public place]].

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] has classified certain voyeuristic fantasies, urges and behaviour patterns as a [[paraphilia]] in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (DSM-IV) if the person has acted on these urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/voyeurismTR.htm |title=BehaveNet Clinical Capsule: Voyeurism |publisher=Behavenet.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114160318/http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/voyeurismTR.htm |archivedate=2011-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is described as a disorder of sexual preference in the [[ICD-10]].&lt;ref name="ICD-10"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSM-IV defines voyeurism as the act of looking at "unsuspecting individuals, usually strangers, who are naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity".&lt;ref name="pmid15204808"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10673220490447245 |title=Voyeur Nation? Changing Definitions of Voyeurism, 1950–2004 |year=2004 |last1=Metzl |first1=Jonathan M. |journal=Harvard Review of Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=127–31 |pmid=15204808}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis would not be given to people who experience typical [[sexual arousal]] simply by seeing nudity or sexual activity. In order to be diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder the symptoms must persist for over six months and the person in question must be over the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=PsychCentral|title=Voyeuristic Disorder Symptoms|url=http://psychcentral.com/disorders/voyeurism-symptoms/|website=PsychCentral|accessdate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical perspectives===
There is relatively little academic research regarding voyeurism. When a review was published in 1976 there were only 15 available resources.&lt;ref name="pmid795401"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01541221 |title=Voyeurism: A review of literature |year=1976 |last1=Smith |first1=R. Spencer |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=585–608 |pmid=795401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voyeurs were well-paying hole-lookers in especially Parisian brothels, a commercial innovation described as far back as 1857 but not gaining much notoriety until the 1880s, and not attracting formal medical-forensic recognition until the early 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last  = Janssen | first = D.F. | year = 2018 | title = “Voyeuristic Disorder”: Etymological and Historical Note | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | issn = 0004-0002 | doi=10.1007/s10508-018-1199-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Society has accepted the use of the term voyeur as a description of anyone who views the intimate lives of others, even outside of a sexual context.&lt;ref name="Metzl2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09502360410001732935 |title=From scopophilia to Survivor: A brief history of voyeurism |year=2004 |last1=Metzl |first1=Jonathan |journal=Textual Practice |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=415–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term is specifically used regarding reality television and other media which allow people to view the personal lives of others. This is a reversal from the historical perspective, moving from a term which describes a specific population in detail, to one which describes the general population vaguely.

One of the few historical theories on the causes of voyeurism comes from psychoanalytic theory. Psychoanalytic theory proposes that voyeurism results from a failure to accept [[castration anxiety]] and as a result a failure to identify with the father.&lt;ref name="pmid15204808" /&gt;

===Prevalence===
Voyeurism has high prevalence rates in most studied populations. Voyeurism was initially believed to only be present in a small portion of the population. This perception changed when [[Alfred Kinsey]] discovered that 30% of men prefer coitus with the lights on.&lt;ref name="pmid15204808" /&gt; This behaviour is not considered voyeurism by today's diagnostic standards, but there was little differentiation between normal and pathological behaviour at the time. Subsequent research showed that 65% of men had engaged in peeping, which suggests that this behaviour is widely spread throughout the population.&lt;ref name="pmid15204808" /&gt; Congruent with this, research found voyeurism to be the most common sexual law-breaking behaviour in both clinical and general populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Sex%20and%20GID%20Lit%20Reviews/Paraphilias/LANGSTROMDSM.pdf|title=The DSM Diagnostic Criteria for Exhibitionism, Voyeurism, and Frotteurism|publisher=Niklas Langstrom|accessdate=2013-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same study it was found that 42% of college males who had never been convicted of a crime had watched others in sexual situations. An earlier study indicates that 54% of men have voyeuristic fantasies, and that 42% have tried voyeurism.&lt;ref name="pmid2064539"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01541940 |title=Patterns of sexual arousal and history in a ?normal? Sample of young men |year=1991 |last1=Templeman |first1=Terrel L. |last2=Stinnett |first2=Ray D. |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=137–50 |pmid=2064539}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a national study of Sweden it was found that 7.7% of the population (both men and women) had engaged in voyeurism at some point.&lt;ref name="pmid16900414"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9042-6 |title=Exhibitionistic and Voyeuristic Behavior in a Swedish National Population Survey |year=2006 |last1=Långström |first1=Niklas |last2=Seto |first2=Michael C. |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=427–35 |pmid=16900414}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that voyeurism occurs up to 150 times more frequently than police reports indicate.&lt;ref name="pmid16900414" /&gt; This same study also indicates that there are high levels of co-occurrence between voyeurism and exhibitionism, finding that 63% of voyeurs also report exhibitionist behaviour.&lt;ref name="pmid16900414" /&gt;
===Characteristics===
Due to the prevalence of voyeurism in society, the people who engage in voyeuristic behaviours are diverse. However, there are some trends regarding who is likely to engage in voyeurism. These statistics apply only to those who qualify as voyeurs under the definition of the DSM, and not the broader modern concept of voyeurism as discussed earlier in this article.

Early research indicated that voyeurs were more mentally healthy than other groups with [[paraphilia]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid795401" /&gt; Compared to the other groups studied, it was found that voyeurs were unlikely to be alcoholics or drug users. More recent research shows that, compared to the general population, voyeurs were moderately more likely to have psychological problems, use alcohol and drugs, and have higher sexual interest generally.&lt;ref name="pmid16900414" /&gt; This study also shows that voyeurs have a greater number of sexual partners per year, and are more likely to have had a same-sex partner than general populations.&lt;ref name="pmid16900414" /&gt; Both older and newer research found that voyeurs typically have a later age of first sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="pmid795401" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16900414" /&gt; However, other research found no difference in sexual history between voyeurs and non-voyeurs.&lt;ref name="pmid2064539" /&gt; Voyeurs who are not also exhibitionists tend to be from a higher [[socioeconomic status]] than those who do show exhibitionist behaviour.&lt;ref name="pmid16900414" /&gt;

Research shows that, like almost all paraphilias, voyeurism is more common in men than in women.&lt;ref name="pmid16900414" /&gt; However, research has found that men and women both report roughly the same likelihood that they would hypothetically engage in voyeurism.&lt;ref name="RyeMeaney2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1300/J514v19n01_06 |title=Voyeurism: It Is Good as Long as We Do Not Get Caught |year=2007 |last1=Rye |first1=B. J. |last2=Meaney |first2=Glenn J. |journal=International Journal of Sexual Health |volume=19 |pages=47–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; There appears to be a greater gender difference when actually presented with the opportunity to perform voyeurism. There is very little research done on voyeurism in women, so very little is known on the subject. One of the few studies deals with a case study of a woman who also had [[schizophrenia]]. This limits the degree to which it can generalise to normal populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hurlbert |first1=David |title=Voyeurism in an adult female with schizoid personality: A case report |journal=Journal of Sex Education &amp; Therapy |year=1992}}{{Page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current perspectives===
[[Lovemap]] theory suggests that voyeurism exists because looking at naked others shifts from an ancillary sexual behaviour, to a primary sexual act.&lt;ref name="RyeMeaney2007" /&gt; This results in a displacement of sexual desire making the act of watching someone the primary means of sexual satisfaction.

Voyeurism has also been linked with [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD). When treated by the same approach as OCD, voyeuristic behaviours significantly decrease.&lt;ref name="pmid10097802"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1018737504537 |year=1999 |last1=Abouesh |first1=Ahmed |last2=Clayton |first2=Anita |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=28 |pages=23–30 |pmid=10097802 |title=Compulsive voyeurism and exhibitionism: A clinical response to paroxetine |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
====Professional treatment====
Historically voyeurism has been treated in a variety of ways. [[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalytic]], [[group psychotherapy]] and [[aversion therapy|shock aversion]] approaches have all been attempted with limited success.&lt;ref name="pmid795401" /&gt; There is some evidence that shows that pornography can be used as a form of treatment for voyeurism. This is based on the idea that countries with pornography censorship have high amounts of voyeurism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rincover |first1=Arnold |title=Can Pornography Be Used as Treatment for Voyeurism? |work=Toronto Star |date=January 13, 1990|page=H2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally shifting voyeurs from voyeuristic behaviour, to looking at graphic pornography, to looking at the nudes in [[Playboy]] has been successfully used as a treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0005-7967(69)90058-8 |title=A case of voyeurism treated by counterconditioning |year=1969 |last1=Jackson |first1=B |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=7 |pages=133–4 |pmid=5767619 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies show that pornography can be used as a means of satisfying voyeuristic desires without breaking the law.

Voyeurism has also been successfully treated with a mix of anti-psychotics and antidepressants. However the patient in this case study had a multitude of other mental health problems. Intense pharmaceutical treatment may not be required for most voyeurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.eurpsy.2008.01.317 |title=Case of Successful treatment of voyeurism |year=2008 |last1=Becirovic |first1=E. |last2=Arnautalic |first2=A. |last3=Softic |first3=R. |last4=Avdibegovic |first4=E. |journal=European Psychiatry |volume=23 |pages=S200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been success in treating voyeurism through using treatment methods for obsessive compulsive disorder. There have been multiple instances of successful treatment of voyeurism through putting patients on fluoxetine and treating their voyeuristic behaviour as a compulsion.&lt;ref name="Metzl2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10097802" /&gt;

==Techniques==

Although small spy cameras had existed for decades, advances in miniaturisation and electronics since the 1950s have greatly aided the ability to conceal [[Minox|miniature cameras]], and the quality and affordability of tiny cameras (often called "spy cameras" or [[Subminiature photography|subminiature cameras]]) has greatly increased. Some consumer digital cameras are now so small that in previous decades they would have qualified as "spy cameras", and [[digital camera]]s of twenty [[megapixel]]s or more are now being embedded in some mobile [[camera phone]]s. The vast majority of mobile phones in use are camera phones.

Certain image capturing devices are capable of producing images through materials that are opaque to visible light, including clothing. These devices form images by using electromagnetic radiation outside the visible range. Infrared and terahertz-wave cameras are capable of creating images through clothing, though these images differ from what would be created with visible light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/04/16/camera.england/index.html |title=New security camera can 'see' through clothes |publisher=CNN |date=April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.i4u.com/article15314.html |title=ThruVision T5000 T-Ray Camera sees through Clothes |publisher=I4U |date=Mar 9, 2008 |first=Luigi |last=Lugmayr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candaulism is a sexual practice or fantasy in which a man exposes his female partner, or images of her, to other people for their voyeuristic pleasure. The term may also be applied to the practice of undressing or otherwise exposing a female partner to others, or urging or forcing her to engage in sexual relations with a third person, such as during a swinging activity. Similarly, the term may also be applied to the posting of personal images of a female partner on the internet or urging or forcing her to wear clothing which reveals her physical attractiveness to others, such as by wearing very brief clothing, such as a microskirt, tight-fitting or see-through clothing or a low-cut top. Candaulism can be viewed as both voyeuristic and exhibitionist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Do Men Want To Expose Their Wives |url=http://www.thecuckoldconsultant.com/artilcles/why-do-men-want-to-expose-their-wives/ |website=The Cuckold Consultant |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminology==
Non-consensual voyeurism is considered to be a form of sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Violence: Definitions|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/sexualviolence/definitions.html|publisher=CDC.gov|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Sexual Abuse Fact Sheet: For Parents, Teachers, and Other Caregivers|url=http://nctsn.org/sites/default/files/assets/pdfs/ChildSexualAbuseFactSheetFINAL_10_2_07.pdf|publisher=National Child Traumatic Stress Network|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Child Sexual Abuse?|url=http://nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/Publications_NSVRC_Media-Packet.pdf|publisher=National Sexual Violence Resource Center|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the interest in a particular subject is obsessive, the behaviour may be described as [[stalking]].

The United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] assert that some individuals who engage in "nuisance" offences (such as voyeurism) may also have a propensity for violence based on behaviours of serious sex offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=R.R. |last1=Hazelwood |first2=J. |last2=Warren |title=The Serial Rapist: His Characteristics and Victims |journal=FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin |date=February 1989 |pages=18–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An FBI researcher has suggested that voyeurs are likely to demonstrate some characteristics that are common, but not universal, among serious sexual offenders who invest considerable time and effort in the capturing of a victim (or image of a victim); careful, methodical planning devoted to the selection and preparation of equipment; and often meticulous attention to detail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/library/leb/leb.htm The Criminal Sexual Sadist] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010331053541/https://www.fbi.gov/library/leb/leb.htm |date=March 31, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little to no research has been done into the demographics of voyeurs.

==Legal status==
Voyeurism is not a crime at [[common law]]. In common law countries it is only a crime if made so by legislation. In [[Canada]], for example, voyeurism was not a crime when the case ''[[Frey v. Fedoruk et al.]]'' arose in 1947.  In that case, in 1950, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] held that courts could not criminalise voyeurism by classifying it as a [[breach of the peace]] and that Parliament would have to specifically outlaw it.  On November 1, 2005, this was done when section 162 was added to the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']], declaring voyeurism to be a sexual offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-78.html?texthighlight=voyeuristic+voyeurism#s-162.|title=Consolidated federal laws of Canada, Criminal Code|first=Legislative Services|last=Branch|website=laws-lois.justice.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries voyeurism is considered to be a [[sex crime]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], for example, non-consensual voyeurism became a criminal offence on May 1, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Section 67 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]; brought into force by the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (Commencement) Order 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the English case of ''R v Turner'' (2006),&lt;ref&gt;(2006) All ER (D) 95 (Jan)&lt;/ref&gt; the manager of a sports centre filmed four women taking showers. There was no indication that the footage had been shown to anyone else or distributed in any way. The defendant pleaded guilty. The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] confirmed a [[sentence (law)|sentence]] of nine months' imprisonment to reflect the seriousness of the abuse of trust and the traumatic effect on the victims.

Another English case in 2009, ''R v Wilkins'' (2010),&lt;ref&gt;(2010) Inner London Crown Court, R v Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BBC Radio producer jailed over sex tapes |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/8549608.stm |date=4 March 2010 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in a man who filmed his intercourse with five of his lovers for his own private viewing, being sentenced to imprisonment for eight months and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register, where his name would remain for ten years.

In a more recent English case in 2013, Mark Lancaster was found guilty and jailed for voyeurism, after having tricked an 18-year-old student into traveling to a rented flat in Milton Keynes, where he filmed her with four secret cameras dressing up as a schoolgirl and posing for photographs before he had sex with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/computer-consultant-mark-lancaster-jailed-for-16-months-for-voyeurism-and-trafficking-after-using-sex-for-fees-website-to-dupe-student-into-having-sex-with-him-8721078.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Jonathan | last1=Brown | first2=Charlotte | last2=Philby | first3=Cahal | last3=Milmo | title=Computer consultant Mark Lancaster jailed for 16 months for voyeurism and trafficking after using 'sex for fees' website to dupe student into having sex with him | date=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, video voyeurism is an offence in nine states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cga.ct.gov/PS98/rpt%5Colr%5Chtm/98-R-1034.htm|title=Voyeurism|first=Sandra|last=Norman-Eady|website=www.cga.ct.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may require the convicted person to register as a [[sex offender]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/peeping-tom Peeping Tom Law &amp; Legal Definition]{{Failed verification|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original case that led to the criminalisation of voyeurism has been made into a television movie called ''[[Video Voyeur]]'' and documents the criminalisation of [[secret photography]].

[[Saudi Arabia]] banned the sale of camera phones nationwide in April 2004, but reversed the ban in December 2004. Some countries, such as [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]], require all camera phones sold in their country to make a clearly audible sound whenever a picture is being taken.

In 2013, the [[Indian Parliament]] made [[Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013|amendments]] to the [[Indian Penal Code]], introducing voyeurism as a criminal offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 |url=http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/TheCrimnalLaw030413.pdf |publisher=Government of India |accessdate=16 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417194151/http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/TheCrimnalLaw030413.pdf |archivedate=17 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A man committing the offence of voyeurism would be liable for imprisonment not less than one year and which may extend up to three years for the first offence, and shall also be liable to fine and for any subsequent conviction would be liable for imprisonment for not less than three years and which may extend up to seven years and with fine.

Voyeurism is generally deemed illegal in [[Singapore]]. [[Singapore]] sentences technologically-enabled voyeurs to a maximum punishment of one year's jail and a fine under the context of insulting a woman's modesty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chong|first1=Elena|title=Marketing manager jailed 18 weeks for upskirt videos|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/marketing-manager-jailed-18-weeks-for-upskirt-videos|accessdate=1 December 2015|publisher=Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent cases in 2016 include the sentencing of church facility manager Kenneth Yeo Jia Chuan who filmed women in toilets by planting pinhole cameras in a handicapped toilet at the Church of Singapore ([[Bukit Timah]]) at [[Hindhede Road]], and in the unisex toilet of the church's office at [[Bukit Timah Shopping Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MOHAMED YUSOF|first1=ZAIHAN|title=Marketing manager jailed 18 weeks for upskirt videos|url=http://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore-news/man-jailed-secretly-filming-women-church-toilets|accessdate=3 March 2016|publisher=The New Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=PAIGE CHELVAN|first1=VANESSA|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/ex-church-staff-jailed-20-months-secretly-filming-women-toilet|accessdate=3 March 2016|publisher=Today|title=Ex-church staff jailed 20 months for secretly filming women in the toilet }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secret photography by law enforcement authorities is called [[surveillance]] and is not considered to be voyeurism, though it may be unlawful or regulated in some countries.

===Films===
*Voyeurism is a main theme in films such as ''[[The Secret Cinema]]'' (1968), ''[[Peepers (film)|Peepers]]'' (2010), and ''[[Sliver (film)|Sliver]]'' (1993), based on a book of the same name by [[Ira Levin]].
*Voyeurism is a common [[plot device]] in both:
**Serious films, e.g., ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Klute]]'' (1971), ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986), and ''[[Disturbia (film)|Disturbia]]'' (2007) and 
**Humorous films, e.g., ''[[Animal House]]'' (1978), ''[[Gregory's Girl]]'' (1981), ''[[Porky's]]'' (1981), ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' (1999), and ''[[Semi-Pro]]'' (2008)
*Voyeuristic photography has been a central element of the ''[[mis-en-scene]]'' of films such as:
** [[Michael Powell]]'s ''[[Peeping Tom (film)|Peeping Tom]]'' (1960), and

'''World Animal Day''' is an international day of action for [[animal rights]] and [[animal welfare|welfare]] celebrated annually on [[October 4]], the [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of [[Francis of Assisi]], the patron saint of animals.

==Aims==
The mission of World Animal Day, is "To raise the status of animals in order to improve welfare standards around the globe. Building the celebration of World Animal Day unites the animal welfare movement, mobilising it into a global force to make the world a better place for all animals.  It's celebrated in different ways in every country, irrespective of nationality, religion, faith or political ideology.  Through increased awareness and education we can create a world where animals are always recognised as sentient beings and full regard is always paid to their welfare."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldanimalday.org.uk/|title=World Animal Day Homepage|website=Worldanimalday.org.uk|accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:St. Francis Day- Blessings of the Animals.webm|thumb|Blessings of the Animals on St. Francis Day in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] (2017)]]
World Animal Day was originated by Heinrich Zimmermann. He organized the first World Animal Day on 24 March 1925 at the Sport Palace in [[Berlin]], Germany. Over 5,000 people attended this first event. The event was originally scheduled for 4 October, to align with the feast day of Saint [[Francis of Assisi]], patron saint of ecology, however the venue was not available on that day. The event was moved to 4 October for the first time in 1929. Initially he found a following only in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Czechoslovakia. Every year Zimmermann worked tirelessly on the promotion of World Animal Day. Finally, in May 1931 at a congress of the International Animal Protection Congress in Florence Italy, his proposal to make 4 October World Animal Day universal, was unanimously accepted and adopted as a resolution.&lt;ref name="orig"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldanimalday.org.uk/img/resource/Origin%20of%20World%20Animal%20Day.pdf|format=PDF|title=THE ORIGIN OF WORLD ANIMAL DAY|website=Worldanimalday.org.uk|accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes cited, incorrectly,&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt; that World Animal Day started in 1931 at the convention of [[ecology|ecologists]] in Florence, Italy who wished to highlight the plight of [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2008/10/world_animal_day.html |title=World Animal Day - Photos - The Big Picture |website=Boston.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://english.sina.com/world/p/2008/1004/189827.html |title=World Animal Day marked - World News |publisher=SINA English |date= |accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, World Animal Day is a global event uniting the animal protection movement, led and sponsored by UK-based [[animal welfare]] charity, [[Naturewatch Foundation]] since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturewatch.org/campaign/world-animal-day |title=World Animal Day &amp;#124; Project sponsored by Naturewatch Foundation |publisher=Naturewatch |date= |accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Rakı Festival''', ''({{lang-tr|Dünya Rakı Festivali}})'', is an overnight street festival in [[Adana]] that emerged from a hundred year long entertainment in the Kazancılar Bazaar where [[Adana Kebab|kebab]], liver and [[rakı]] are accompanied with the street music and dances.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnnturk.com/haber/turkiye/rakicilar-bir-kez-daha-dunya-raki-gunune-hazirlaniyor&lt;/ref&gt;

Rakı Festival is held every year on the second Saturday night of December. The dinner tables are placed on more than 10 streets around [[Büyüksaat]]. Besides the kebab restaurants of the area, kebap and liver vendors settle on the streets and serve food. Street musicians, playing drums and [[zurna]] visit the tables and entertain visitors. Night long music, dancing, eating and drinking ends with the sunrise on Sunday.

The Islamist media targeted and took hardline on the festival in 2015, months before taking place. At an interview with the Adana Governor of the national government, the Governor stated that he would not permit the festival where rakı is consumed at the streets. To avoid the ban, the festival organisers renamed the festival as '''Adana Kebap and Şalgam Festival''', though the festival of 2015 happened no different than the ones in the previous years and the festival continued to be called the Rakı Festival by public.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/12/fury-as-turkey-axes-raki-festival-amid-alcohol-crackdown&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adana Rakı Festival1.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Dining during the festival]]

==History==
The visitors of the live bird market that used to set up very early on Sundays at the Kazancılar area, had liver kebab breakfasts here together with the men that get out from the payvon ''({{lang-en|night club}})''. Thus, Kazancılar became the core of the kebab and liver dining culture in Adana for more than hundred years. Besides serving kebab to the businesses in the old town during the days, the kebab restaurants of Kazancılar are open late every night for food and entertainment and are frequented by Adana locals.  Saturday overnight entertainment is accompanied by the liver breakfast tradition, that starts around 5am on Sunday lasting until noon. In 2010, Group of frequenters of Kazancılar designated the second Saturday of December as the '''World Rakı Day''', to celebrate the popular national alcoholic beverage that combines well with kebab and şalgam. People initiated World Rakı Day was first celebrated on December 10, 2011. As years pass, the rakı celebration took attention not only from Adana locals, but by the kebab and rakı lovers from the [[Çukurova]] region and from all over Turkey. In year 2014, the festival is visited by more than 20 thousand people and took wide coverage on national media.

The festival in 2015, gathered a record of visitors, despite the banning requests by the Islamist media and supporting statements from the Adana Governor. At around 22:00, at the time the people were dining at the tables on the streets, a group of four Islamist attacked the festival with a pump rifle, gun, sticks and [[döner]] knife. After shooting twice to the air, the group attack the tables with sticks and döner knife, chanting anti-alcohol slogans. After a short chase, the civil police caught all the attackers and took them to the police station. The attack did not cause any injury or death and the entertainment continued afterwards until the early morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/turkiye/447393/Raki_festivaline_tabancali__av_tufekli__sopali__doner_bicakli_saldiri.html| title = Rakı Festivaline Saldırı(Turkish)| author=| publisher=Cumhuriyet| accessdate=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-turkey-alcohol-idUKKBN0TW0O520151213| title = Armed men storm raki festival in Turkey in anti-alcohol protest| author=| publisher=Reuters| accessdate=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
