{{about|adiabatic processes in thermodynamics|the adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics|adiabatic theorem}}

In thermodynamics, an '''adiabatic process''' is one that occurs without transfer of [[heat]] or [[mass]] of substances between a [[thermodynamic system]] and its surroundings. In an adiabatic process, energy is transferred to the surroundings only as [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]].&lt;ref name="Carathéodory"&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Constantin Carathéodory|last=Carathéodory |first=C. |date=1909 |title=Untersuchungen über die Grundlagen der Thermodynamik |journal=Mathematische Annalen |volume=67 |pages=355–386 |doi=10.1007/BF01450409}}. A translation may be found [http://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/caratheodory_-_thermodynamics.pdf here].  Also a mostly reliable [https://books.google.com/books?id=xwBRAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Investigation+into+the+foundations translation is to be found] in {{cite book|last=Kestin |first=J. |date=1976 |title=The Second Law of Thermodynamics |publisher=Dowden, Hutchinson &amp; Ross |location=Stroudsburg, PA |ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailyn 21"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bailyn |first=M. |date=1994 |title=A Survey of Thermodynamics |publisher=American Institute of Physics Press |location=New York, NY|ISBN=0-88318-797-3 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adiabatic process provides a rigorous conceptual basis for the theory used to expound the [[first law of thermodynamics]], and as such it is a key concept in [[thermodynamics]].

Some chemical and physical processes occur so rapidly that they may be conveniently described by the term "adiabatic approximation", meaning that there is not enough time for the transfer of energy as heat to take place to or from the system.&lt;ref name="Bailyn 53"&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

By way of example, the [[adiabatic flame temperature]] is an idealization that uses the "adiabatic approximation" so as to provide an upper limit calculation of temperatures produced by combustion of a fuel. The adiabatic flame temperature is the temperature that would be achieved by a [[fire|flame]] if the process of combustion took place in the absence of heat loss to the surroundings.

In [[meteorology]] and [[oceanography]], the adiabatic cooling process produces condensation of moisture or salinity and the [[Fluid parcel|parcel]] becomes oversaturated. Therefore, it is necessary to take away the excess. There the process becomes a ''pseudo-adiabatic process'' in which the liquid water/salt that condenses is assumed to be removed as soon as it is formed, by idealized instantaneous [[precipitation]]. The pseudoadiabatic process is only defined for expansion, since a parcel that is compressed become warmer and remains undersaturated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Pseudoadiabatic_process|title=pseudoadiabatic process|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=November 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

A process that does not involve the transfer of heat or matter into or out of a system, so that {{math|''Q'' {{=}} 0}}, is called an adiabatic process, and such a system is said to be adiabatically isolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=László Tisza|last=Tisza |first=L. |date=1966 |title=Generalized Thermodynamics |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |quote=(adiabatic partitions inhibit the transfer of heat and mass) |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970), p. 48: "mass is an adiabatically inhibited variable."&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption that a process is adiabatic is a frequently made simplifying assumption. For example, the compression of a gas within a cylinder of an engine is assumed to occur so rapidly that on the time scale of the compression process, little of the system's energy can be transferred out as heat to the surroundings. Even though the cylinders are not insulated and are quite conductive, that process is idealized to be adiabatic. The same can be said to be true for the expansion process of such a system.

The assumption of adiabatic isolation of a system is a useful one, and is often combined with others  so as to make the calculation of the system's behaviour possible. Such assumptions are idealizations. The behaviour of actual machines deviates from these idealizations, but the assumption of such "perfect" behaviour provide a useful first approximation of how the real world works. According to [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]], when sound travels in a gas, there is no time for heat conduction in the medium and so the propagation of sound is adiabatic. For such an adiabatic process, the [[Elastic modulus|modulus of elasticity]] ([[Young's modulus]]) can be expressed as {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''γP''}}, where {{math|''γ''}} is the [[Heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heats]] at constant pressure and at constant volume ({{math|''γ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''|''C&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''}}}} ) and {{math|''P''}} is the pressure of the gas .

=== Various applications of the adiabatic assumption ===

For a closed system, one may write the [[first law of thermodynamics]] as : {{math|Δ''U'' {{=}} ''Q'' + ''W''}}, where {{math|Δ''U''}} denotes the change of the system's internal energy, {{math|''Q''}} the quantity of energy added to it as heat, and {{math|''W''}} the work done on it by its surroundings.

*If the system has rigid walls such that work cannot be transferred in or out ({{math|''W'' {{=}} 0}}), and the walls of the system are not adiabatic and energy is added in the form of heat ({{math|''Q'' &gt; 0}}), and there is no phase change, the temperature of the system will rise.
*If the system has rigid walls such that pressure–volume work cannot be done, and the system walls are adiabatic ({{math|''Q'' {{=}} 0}}), but energy is added as isochoric work in the form of friction or the stirring of a viscous fluid within the system ({{math|''W'' &gt; 0}}), and there is no phase change, the temperature of the system will rise.
*If the system walls are adiabatic ({{math|''Q'' {{=}} 0}}), but not rigid ({{math|''W'' ≠ 0}}), and, in a fictive idealized process, energy is added to the system in the form of frictionless, non-viscous pressure–volume work, and there is no phase change, the temperature of the system will rise. Such a process is called an [[isentropic process]] and is said to be "reversible". Fictively, if the process is reversed, the energy added as work can be recovered entirely as work done by the system. If the system contains a compressible gas and is reduced in volume, the uncertainty of the position of the gas is reduced, and seemingly would reduce the entropy of the system, but the temperature of the system will rise as the process is isentropic ({{math|Δ''S'' {{=}} 0}}). Should the work be added in such a way that friction or viscous forces are operating within the system, then the process is not isentropic, and if there is no phase change, then the temperature of the system will rise, the process is said to be "irreversible", and the work added to the system is not entirely recoverable in the form of work.
*If the walls of a system are not adiabatic, and energy is transferred in as heat, entropy is transferred into the system with the heat. Such a process is neither adiabatic nor isentropic, having {{math|''Q'' &gt; 0}}, and {{math|Δ''S'' &gt; 0}} according to the second law of thermodynamics.

Naturally occurring adiabatic processes are irreversible (entropy is produced).

The transfer of energy as work into an adiabatically isolated system can be imagined as being of two idealized extreme kinds. In one such kind, there is no entropy produced within the system (no friction, viscous dissipation, etc.), and the work is only pressure-volume work (denoted by {{math|''P'' d''V''}}). In nature, this ideal kind occurs only approximately, because it demands an infinitely slow process and no sources of dissipation.

The other extreme kind of work is isochoric work ({{math|d''V'' {{=}} 0}}), for which energy is added as work solely through friction or viscous dissipation within the system. A stirrer that transfers energy to a viscous fluid of an adiabatically isolated system with rigid walls, without phase change, will cause a rise in temperature of the fluid, but that work is not recoverable. Isochoric work is irreversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Münster |first=A. |date=1970 |title=Classical Thermodynamics |translator-first=E. S. |translator-last=Halberstadt |publisher=Wiley–Interscience |location=London |ISBN=0-471-62430-6 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second law of thermodynamics observes that a natural process, of transfer of energy as work, always consists at least of isochoric work and often both of these extreme kinds of work. Every natural process, adiabatic or not, is irreversible, with {{math|Δ''S'' &gt; 0}}, as friction or viscosity are always present to some extent.

==Adiabatic heating and cooling==
The adiabatic compression of a gas causes a rise in temperature of the gas. Adiabatic expansion against pressure, or a spring, causes a drop in temperature. In contrast, [[free expansion]] is an [[isothermal]] process for an ideal gas.

'''Adiabatic heating''' occurs when the pressure of a gas is increased from work done on it by its surroundings, e.g., a [[piston]] compressing a gas contained within a cylinder and raising the temperature where in many practical situations heat conduction through walls can be slow compared with the compression time.  This finds practical application in [[diesel engines]] which rely on the lack of heat dissipation during the compression stroke to elevate the fuel vapor temperature sufficiently to ignite it.

Adiabatic heating occurs in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] when an [[air mass]] descends, for example, in a [[katabatic wind]], [[Foehn wind]], or [[chinook wind]] flowing downhill over a mountain range. When a parcel of air descends, the pressure on the parcel increases. Due to this increase in pressure, the parcel's volume decreases and its temperature increases as work is done on the parcel of air, thus increasing its internal energy, which manifests itself by a rise in the temperature of that mass of air. The parcel of air can only slowly dissipate the energy by conduction or radiation (heat), and to a first approximation it can be considered adiabatically isolated and the process an adiabatic process.

'''Adiabatic cooling''' occurs when the pressure on an adiabatically isolated system is decreased, allowing it to expand, thus causing it to do work on its surroundings. When the pressure applied on a parcel of air is reduced, the air in the parcel is allowed to expand; as the volume increases, the temperature falls as its internal energy decreases. Adiabatic cooling occurs in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] with [[orographic lifting]] and [[lee waves]], and this can form [[Pileus (meteorology)|pileus]] or [[lenticular cloud]]s.

Adiabatic cooling does not have to involve a fluid. One technique used to reach very low temperatures (thousandths and even millionths of a degree above absolute zero) is via [[adiabatic demagnetization|adiabatic demagnetisation]], where the change in [[magnetic field]] on a magnetic material is used to provide adiabatic cooling. Also, the contents of an [[expanding universe]] can be described (to first order) as an adiabatically cooling fluid. (See [[heat death of the universe]].)

Rising magma also undergoes adiabatic cooling before eruption, particularly significant in the case of magmas that rise quickly from great depths such as [[kimberlite]]s.&lt;ref name="Kavanagh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kavanagh|first=J. L.|last2=Sparks |first2=R. S. J.|year=2009|title=Temperature changes in ascending kimberlite magmas|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|volume=286|issue=3–4|pages=404–413|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2009.07.011|url=https://monash.academia.edu/JanineKavanagh/Papers/114092/Temperature_changes_in_ascending_kimberlite_magma|accessdate=18 February 2012|bibcode = 2009E&amp;PSL.286..404K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such temperature changes can be quantified using the [[ideal gas law]], or the [[hydrostatic equation]] for atmospheric processes.

In practice, no process is truly adiabatic. Many processes rely on a large difference in time scales of the process of interest and the rate of heat dissipation across a system boundary, and thus are approximated by using an adiabatic assumption. There is always some heat loss, as no perfect insulators exist.

==Ideal gas (reversible process)==
{{main article|Reversible adiabatic process}}

[[Image:Adiabatic.svg|thumb|341px|For a simple substance, during an adiabatic process in which the volume increases, the [[internal energy]] of the working substance must decrease]]
The mathematical equation for an [[ideal gas]] undergoing a reversible (i.e., no entropy generation) adiabatic process can be represented by the [[polytropic process]] equation&lt;ref name="Bailyn 53"/&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt; P V^n = \text{constant}, &lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''P''}} is pressure, {{math|''V''}} is volume, and for this case {{math|''n'' {{=}} ''γ''}}, where 
: &lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{C_P}{C_V} = \frac{f + 2}{f}, &lt;/math&gt;
{{math|''C&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;''}} being the [[specific heat]] for constant pressure, {{math|''C&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''}} being the specific heat for constant volume, {{math|''γ''}} is the [[adiabatic index]], and {{math|''f''}} is the number of [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] (3 for monatomic gas, 5 for diatomic gas and collinear molecules e.g. carbon dioxide).

For a monatomic ideal gas, {{math|''γ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|5|3}}}}, and for a diatomic gas (such as [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]], the main components of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]) {{math|''γ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|7|5}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/adiab.html Adiabatic Processes].&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the above formula is only applicable to classical ideal gases and not [[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose–Einstein]] or [[Fermionic condensate|Fermi gases]].

For reversible adiabatic processes, it is also true that&lt;ref name="Bailyn 53"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; P^{1-\gamma} T^\gamma = \text{constant},&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; VT^\frac{f}{2} = \text{constant},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is an absolute temperature. This can also be written as&lt;ref name="Bailyn 53"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; TV^{\gamma - 1} = \text{constant}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Example of adiabatic compression===
The compression stroke in a [[gasoline engine]] can be used as an example of adiabatic compression.  The model assumptions are: the uncompressed volume of the cylinder is one litre (1&amp;nbsp;L = 1000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.001&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;); the gas within is the air consisting of molecular nitrogen and oxygen only (thus a diatomic gas with 5 degrees of freedom, and so {{math|''γ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|7|5}}}}); the compression ratio of the engine is 10:1 (that is, the 1&amp;nbsp;L volume of uncompressed gas is reduced to 0.1&amp;nbsp;L by the piston); and the uncompressed gas is at approximately room temperature and pressure (a warm room temperature of ~27&amp;nbsp;°C, or 300&amp;nbsp;K, and a pressure of 1&amp;nbsp;bar = 100&amp;nbsp;kPa, i.e. typical sea-level atmospheric pressure).

: &lt;math&gt; P_1 V^\gamma = \operatorname{constant}_1 = 100\,000~\text{Pa} \times (0.001~\text{m}^3)^\frac75 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; = 10^5 \times 6.31 \times 10^{-5}~\text{Pa}\,\text{m}^{21/5} = 6.31~\text{Pa}\,\text{m}^{21/5},&lt;/math&gt;

so our adiabatic constant for this example is about 6.31&amp;nbsp;Pa&amp;thinsp;m&lt;sup&gt;4.2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The gas is now compressed to a 0.1&amp;nbsp;L (0.0001&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) volume (we will assume this happens quickly enough that no heat can enter or leave the gas through the walls). The adiabatic constant remains the same, but with the resulting pressure unknown

: &lt;math&gt; P_2 V^\gamma = \operatorname{constant}_1 = 6.31~\text{Pa}\,\text{m}^{21/5} = P \times (0.0001~\text{m}^3)^\frac75, &lt;/math&gt;

so solving for ''P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'':

: &lt;math&gt; P_2 = \frac{6.31~\text{Pa}\,\text{m}^{21/5}}{(0.0001~\text{m}^3)^\frac75} = \frac{6.31~\text{Pa}\,\text{m}^{21/5}}{2.5 \times 10^{-6}~\text{m}^{21/5}} = 2.51 \times 10^6~\text{Pa}, &lt;/math&gt;

or 25.1&amp;nbsp;bar. Note that this pressure increase is more than a simple 10:1 compression ratio would indicate; this is because the gas is not only compressed, but the work done to compress the gas also increases its internal energy, which manifests itself by a rise in the gas temperature and an additional rise in pressure above what would result from a simplistic calculation of 10 times the original pressure.

We can solve for the temperature of the compressed gas in the engine cylinder as well, using the ideal gas law, ''PV''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''nRT'' (''n'' is amount of gas in moles and ''R'' the gas constant for that gas). Our initial conditions being 100&amp;nbsp;kPa of pressure, 1&amp;nbsp;L volume, and 300&amp;nbsp;K of temperature, our experimental constant (''nR'') is:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{PV}{T}  = \operatorname{constant}_2 = \frac{10^5~\text{Pa} \times 10^{-3}~\text{m}^3}{300~\text{K}} = 0.333~\text{Pa}\,\text{m}^3\text{K}^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

We know the compressed gas has {{mvar|V}}&amp;nbsp;= 0.1&amp;nbsp;L and {{mvar|P}}&amp;nbsp;= {{val|2.51|e=6|u=Pa}}, so we can solve for temperature:

: &lt;math&gt; T = \frac{P V}{\operatorname{constant}_2} = \frac{2.51 \times 10^6~\text{Pa} \times 10^{-4}~\text{m}^3}{0.333~\text{Pa}\,\text{m}^3\text{K}^{-1}} = 753~\text{K}. &lt;/math&gt;

That is a final temperature of 753&amp;nbsp;K, or 479&amp;nbsp;°C, or 896&amp;nbsp;°F, well above the ignition point of many fuels.  This is why a high-compression engine requires fuels specially formulated to not self-ignite (which would cause [[engine knocking]] when operated under these conditions of temperature and pressure), or that a [[supercharger]] with an [[intercooler]] to provide a pressure boost but with a lower temperature rise would be advantageous.  A [[diesel engine]] operates under even more extreme conditions, with compression ratios of 20:1 or more being typical, in order to provide a very high gas temperature, which ensures immediate ignition of the injected fuel.

===Adiabatic free expansion of a gas===
{{See also|Free expansion}}
For an adiabatic free expansion of an ideal gas, the gas is contained in an insulated container and then allowed to expand in a vacuum. Because there is no external pressure for the gas to expand against, the work done by or on the system is zero. Since this process does not involve any heat transfer or work, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] then implies that the net internal energy change of the system is zero. For an ideal gas, the temperature remains constant because the internal energy only depends on temperature in that case. Since at constant temperature, the entropy is proportional to the volume, the entropy increases in this case, therefore this process is irreversible.

===Derivation of ''P''–''V'' relation for adiabatic heating and cooling===
The definition of an adiabatic process is that heat transfer to the system is zero, {{math|''δQ'' {{=}} 0}}. Then, according to the [[first law of thermodynamics]],

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(1)} \qquad d U + \delta W = \delta Q = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''dU''}} is the change in the internal energy of the system and {{math|''δW''}} is work done ''by'' the system. Any work ({{math|''δW''}}) done must be done at the expense of internal energy {{math|''U''}}, since no heat {{math|''δQ''}} is being supplied from the surroundings. Pressure–volume work {{math|''δW''}} done ''by'' the system is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(2)} \qquad \delta W = P \, dV. &lt;/math&gt;

However, {{math|''P''}} does not remain constant during an adiabatic process but instead changes along with {{math|''V''}}.

It is desired to know how the values of {{math|''dP''}} and {{math|''dV''}} relate to each other as the adiabatic process proceeds. For an ideal gas the internal energy is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(3)} \qquad U = \alpha n R T, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''α''}} is the number of [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] divided by two, {{math|''R''}} is the [[universal gas constant]] and {{math|''n''}} is the number of moles in the system (a constant).

Differentiating equation (3) and use of the [[ideal gas law]], {{math|''PV'' {{=}} ''nRT''}}, yields

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(4)} \qquad d U = \alpha n R \, dT
                  = \alpha \, d (P V)
                  = \alpha (P \, dV + V \, dP). &lt;/math&gt;

Equation (4) is often expressed as {{math|''dU'' {{=}} ''nC&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; dT''}} because {{math|''C&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''αR''}}.

Now substitute equations (2) and (4) into equation (1) to obtain

: &lt;math&gt; -P \, dV = \alpha P \, dV + \alpha V \, dP,&lt;/math&gt;

factorize {{math|−''P dV''}}:

: &lt;math&gt; -(\alpha + 1) P \, dV = \alpha V \, dP,&lt;/math&gt;

and divide both sides by {{math|''PV''}}:

: &lt;math&gt; -(\alpha + 1) \frac{dV}{V} = \alpha \frac{dP}{P}. &lt;/math&gt;

After integrating the left and right sides from {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''V''}} and from {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''P''}} and changing the sides respectively,

: &lt;math&gt; \ln \left( \frac{P}{P_0} \right) = -\frac{\alpha + 1}{\alpha} \ln \left( \frac{V}{V_0} \right). &lt;/math&gt;

Exponentiate both sides, substitute {{math|{{sfrac|''α'' + 1|''α''}}}} with {{math|''γ''}}, the [[heat capacity ratio]]

: &lt;math&gt; \left( \frac{P}{P_0} \right) = \left( \frac{V}{V_0} \right)^{-\gamma}, &lt;/math&gt;

and eliminate the negative sign to obtain

: &lt;math&gt; \left( \frac{P}{P_0} \right) = \left( \frac{V_0}{V} \right)^\gamma. &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

: &lt;math&gt; \left( \frac{P}{P_0} \right) \left( \frac{V}{V_0} \right)^\gamma = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt; P_0 V_0^\gamma = P V^\gamma = \operatorname{constant}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation of ''P''–''T'' relation for adiabatic heating and cooling===

Substituting the ideal gas law into the above, we obtain

: &lt;math&gt; P \left(\frac{n R T}{P}\right)^\gamma = \operatorname{constant}, &lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to

: &lt;math&gt; P^{1-\gamma} T^\gamma = \operatorname{constant}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation of discrete formula===
The change in internal energy of a system, measured from state 1 to state 2, is equal to

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(1)} \qquad \Delta U = \alpha R nT_2 - \alpha R nT_1 = \alpha Rn \Delta T. &lt;/math&gt;

At the same time, the work done by the pressure–volume changes as a result from this process, is equal to

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(2)} \qquad W = \int_{V_1}^{V_2}P \,dV. &lt;/math&gt;

Since we require the process to be adiabatic, the following equation needs to be true

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(3)} \qquad \Delta U + W = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

By the previous derivation,

:&lt;math&gt; \text{(4)} \qquad P V^\gamma = \text{constant} = P_1 V_1^\gamma. &lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging (4) gives

:&lt;math&gt; P = P_1 \left(\frac{V_1}{V} \right)^\gamma. &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into (2) gives

:&lt;math&gt; W = \int_{V_1}^{V_2} P_1 \left(\frac{V_1}{V} \right)^\gamma \,dV. &lt;/math&gt;

Integrating,

:&lt;math&gt; W = P_1 V_1^\gamma \frac{V_2^{1-\gamma} - V_1^{1-\gamma}}{1 - \gamma}. &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting {{math|''γ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''α'' + 1|''α''}}}},

:&lt;math&gt; W = -\alpha P_1 V_1^\gamma \left( V_2^{1-\gamma} - V_1^{1-\gamma} \right). &lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging,

:&lt;math&gt; W = -\alpha P_1 V_1 \left( \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right)^{1-\gamma} - 1 \right). &lt;/math&gt;

Using the ideal gas law and assuming a constant molar quantity (as often happens in practical cases),

:&lt;math&gt; W = -\alpha n R T_1 \left( \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right)^{1-\gamma} - 1 \right). &lt;/math&gt;

By the continuous formula,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)^{-\gamma}, &lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{-\frac{1}{\gamma}} = \frac{V_2}{V_1}. &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into the previous expression for {{math|''W''}},

:&lt;math&gt; W = -\alpha n R T_1 \left( \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} - 1 \right). &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this expression and (1) in (3) gives

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha n R (T_2 - T_1) = \alpha n R T_1 \left( \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} - 1 \right). &lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying,

:&lt;math&gt; T_2 - T_1 =  T_1 \left( \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} - 1 \right), &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{T_2}{T_1} - 1 =  \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} - 1, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; T_2 = T_1 \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Graphing adiabats==
An adiabat is a curve of constant [[entropy]] in a diagram. Some properties of adiabats on a ''P''–''V'' diagram are indicated. These properties may be read from the classical behaviour of ideal gases, except in the region where ''PV'' becomes small (low temperature), where quantum effects become important.

# Every adiabat [[asymptotically]] approaches both the ''V'' axis and the ''P'' axis (just like [[isotherms]]).
# Each adiabat intersects each isotherm exactly once.
# An adiabat looks similar to an isotherm, except that during an expansion, an adiabat loses more pressure than an isotherm, so it has a steeper inclination (more vertical).
# If isotherms are concave towards the north-east direction (45°), then adiabats are concave towards the east north-east (31°).
# If adiabats and isotherms are graphed at regular intervals of entropy and temperature, respectively (like altitude on a contour map), then as the eye moves towards the axes (towards the south-west), it sees the density of isotherms stay constant, but it sees the density of adiabats grow.  The exception is very near absolute zero, where the density of adiabats drops sharply and they become rare (see [[Nernst's theorem]]).{{clarify|reason=No quantitative formula is identified in that article as Nernst's theorem, only a qualitative "Impossibility Principle"|date=March 2015}}

The following diagram is a ''P''–''V'' diagram with a superposition of adiabats and isotherms:

The isotherms are the red curves and the adiabats are the black curves.

The adiabats are isentropic.

Volume is the horizontal axis and pressure is the vertical axis.

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|adiabatic}}
The term ''adiabatic'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|d|i|ə|ˈ|b|æ|t|ɪ|k}}) is an anglicization of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] term  ἀδιάβατος "impassable" (used by [[Xenophon]] of rivers).
It is used in the thermodynamic sense by  [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine]] (1866),&lt;ref name="Rankine 1866"&gt;[[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine, W.J.McQ.]] (1866).

The etymological origin corresponds here to an impossibility of [[Heat|transfer of energy as heat]] and of transfer of matter across the wall. 

The Greek word ἀδιάβατος is formed from   [[privative a|privative ἀ-]]  ("not") and διαβατός, "passable", in turn deriving from διά ("through"), and βαῖνειν ("to walk, go, come").&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Liddell|Liddell, H.G.]], [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott, R.]] (1940). ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', Clarendon Press, Oxford UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual significance in thermodynamic theory==

The adiabatic process has been important for thermodynamics since its early days. It was important in the work of Joule, because it provided a way of nearly directly relating quantities of heat and work.

For a thermodynamic system that is enclosed by walls that do not allow [[mass transfer]], energy can pass in and out only as heat or work. Thus a quantity of work can be related almost directly to an equivalent quantity of heat in a cycle of two limbs. The first is an isochoric adiabatic work process that adds to the system's [[internal energy]]. Then an isochoric and workless heat transfer returns the system to its original state. The first limb adds a definite amount of energy and the second removes it. Accordingly, Rankine measured quantity of heat in units of work, rather than as a calorimetric quantity .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-link=William John Macquorn Rankine|last=Rankine |first=W. J. M. |date=1854 |title=On the geometrical representation of the expansive action of heat, and theory of thermodynamic engines |journal=Proc. Roy.

Soc. |volume=144 |pages=115–175}} [https://archive.org/stream/miscellaneoussci00rank#page/341/mode/1up/search/transmission Miscellaneous Scientific Papers p. 341].&lt;/ref&gt; which he later called an adiabatic curve.&lt;ref name="Rankine 1866"/&gt; Besides it two isothermal limbs, Carnot's cycle has two adiabatic limbs.

For the foundations of thermodynamics, the conceptual importance of this was emphasized by Bryan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-link=George H. Bryan|last=Bryan |first=G. H. |date=1907 |url=https://archive.org/details/ost-physics-thermodynamicsin00bryauoft |title=Thermodynamics. An Introductory Treatise dealing mainly with First Principles and their Direct Applications |publisher=B. G. Teubner |location=Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Carathéodory,&lt;ref name="Carathéodory"/&gt; and by Born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-link=Max Born|last=Born |first=M. |date=1949 |url=https://archive.org/details/naturalphilosoph032159mbp |title=Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that calorimetry presupposes a type of temperature as already defined before the statement of the first law of thermodynamics, such as one based on empirical scales. Such a presupposition involves making the distinction between empirical temperature and absolute temperature. Rather, the definition of absolute thermodynamic temperature is best left till the second law is available as a conceptual basis.&lt;ref name="Bailyn Ch 3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bailyn |first=M. |date=1994 |title=A Survey of Thermodynamics |publisher=American Institute of Physics |location=New York, NY|ISBN=0-88318-797-3 |chapter=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eighteenth century, the law of conservation of energy was yet to be fully formulated or established, and the nature of heat was debated. One approach to these problems was to regard heat, measured by calorimetry, as a primary substance that is conserved in quantity. By the middle of the nineteenth century, it was recognized as a form of energy, and the law of conservation of energy was thereby also recognized. The view that eventually established itself, and is currently regarded as right, is that the law of conservation of energy is a primary axiom, and that heat is to be analyzed as consequential. In this light, heat cannot be a component of the total energy of a single body because it is not a [[State function|state variable]], but, rather, is a variable that describes a process of transfer between two bodies. The adiabatic process is important because it is a logical ingredient of this current view.&lt;ref name="Bailyn Ch 3"/&gt;

==Divergent usages of the word ''adiabatic''==
This present article is written from the viewpoint of macroscopic thermodynamics, and the word ''adiabatic'' is used in this article in the traditional way of thermodynamics, introduced by Rankine. It is pointed out in the present article that, for example, if a compression of a gas is rapid, then there is little time for heat transfer to occur, even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated by a definite wall. In this sense, a rapid compression of a gas is sometimes approximately or loosely said to be ''adiabatic'', though often far from isentropic, even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated by a definite wall.

[[Quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum statistical mechanics]], however, use the word ''adiabatic'' [[Adiabatic theorem#Diabatic vs. adiabatic processes|in a very different sense]], one that can at times seem almost opposite to the classical thermodynamic sense. In quantum theory, the word ''adiabatic'' can mean something perhaps near isentropic, or perhaps near quasi-static, but the usage of the word is very different between the two disciplines.

On the one hand, in quantum theory, if a perturbative element of compressive work is done almost infinitely slowly (that is to say quasi-statically), it is said to have been done ''adiabatically''. The idea is that the shapes of the eigenfunctions change slowly and continuously, so that no quantum jump is triggered, and the change is virtually reversible. While the occupation numbers are unchanged, nevertheless there is change in the energy levels of one-to-one corresponding, pre- and post-compression, eigenstates. Thus a perturbative element of work has been done without heat transfer and without introduction of random change within the system. For example, [[Max Born]] writes "Actually, it is usually the 'adiabatic' case with which we have to do: i.e. the limiting case where the external force (or the reaction of the parts of the system on each other) acts very slowly. In this case, to a very high approximation

:&lt;math&gt;c_1^2=1,\,\,c_2^2=0,\,\,c_3^2=0,\,...\,,&lt;/math&gt;

that is, there is no probability for a transition, and the system is in the initial state after cessation of the perturbation. Such a slow perturbation is therefore reversible, as it is classically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-link=Max Born|last=Born |first=M. |date=1927 |title=Physical aspects of quantum mechanics |journal=Nature |volume=119 |pages=354–357|bibcode = 1927Natur.119..354B |doi = 10.1038/119354a0 }} (Translation by Robert Oppenheimer.)&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in quantum theory, if a perturbative element of compressive work is done rapidly, it randomly changes the occupation numbers of the eigenstates, as well as changing their shapes. In that theory, such a rapid change is said not to be ''adiabatic'', and the contrary word ''[[Adiabatic theorem#Diabatic vs. adiabatic processes|diabatic]]'' is applied to it. One might guess that perhaps Clausius, if he were confronted with this, in the now-obsolete language he used in his day, would have said that "internal work" was done and that 'heat was generated though not transferred'.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In classical thermodynamics, such a rapid change would still be called adiabatic because the system is adiabatically isolated, and there is no transfer of energy as heat. The strong irreversibility of the change, due to viscosity or other entropy production, does not impinge on this classical usage.

Thus for a mass of gas, in macroscopic thermodynamics, words are so used that a compression is sometimes loosely or approximately said to be adiabatic if it is rapid enough to avoid heat transfer, even if the system is not adiabatically isolated. But in quantum statistical theory, a compression is not called adiabatic if it is rapid, even if the system is adiabatically isolated in the classical thermodynamic sense of the term. The words are used differently in the two disciplines, as stated just above.

'''Avogadro's law''' (sometimes referred to as '''Avogadro's hypothesis''' or '''Avogadro's principle''') is an experimental [[gas laws|gas law]] relating the [[volume]] of a gas to the [[amount of substance]] of gas present.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/science/Avogadros-law | last= Editors of the Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Avogadro's law| website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|  | accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law is a specific case of the [[ideal gas law]]. A modern statement is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

Avogadro's law states that, "equal volumes of all gases, at the same temperature and pressure, have the same number of molecules."&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

For a given mass of an [[ideal gas]], the volume and amount (moles) of the gas are directly proportional if the [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] are constant.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The law is named after [[Amedeo Avogadro]] who, in 1811,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Amedeo | last = Avogadro | authorlink = Amedeo Avogadro | title = Essai d'une manière de déterminer les masses relatives des molécules élémentaires des corps, et les proportions selon lesquelles elles entrent dans ces combinaisons | journal = Journal de Physique | year = 1810 | volume = 73 | pages = 58–76 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MxgTAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }} [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/avogadro.html English translation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US Definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/Avogadro's%20law|title=Avogadro's law|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Merriam-Webster]] Medical Dictionary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; hypothesized that two given samples of an ideal gas, of the same volume and at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. As an example, equal volumes of molecular [[hydrogen]] and [[nitrogen]] contain the same number of molecules when they are at the same temperature and pressure, and observe [[ideal gas]] behavior. In practice, real gases show small deviations from the ideal behavior and the law holds only approximately, but is still a useful approximation for scientists.

==Mathematical definition==
The law can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;V \propto n\,&lt;/math&gt;

or
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{n}=k&lt;/math&gt;

where

:''V'' is the [[volume]] of the gas;
:''n'' is the [[amount of substance]] of the gas (measured in [[mole (unit)|moles]]);
:''k'' is a [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]] for a given temperature and pressure.

This law describes how, under the same condition of [[temperature]] and [[pressure]], equal [[volume]]s of all [[gas]]es contain the same number of [[molecule]]s. For comparing the same substance under two different sets of conditions, the law can be usefully expressed as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1}{n_1} = \frac{V_2}{n_2}&lt;/math&gt;

The equation shows that, as the number of moles of gas increases, the volume of the gas also increases in proportion. Similarly, if the number of moles of gas is decreased, then the volume also decreases. Thus, the number of molecules or atoms in a specific volume of ideal gas is independent of their size or the [[molar mass]] of the gas.

=== Derivation from the ideal gas law ===
The derivation of Avogadro's law follows directly from the [[ideal gas law]], i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;PV=nRT&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''R'' is the [[gas constant]], ''T'' is the [[Thermodynamic temperature|Kelvin temperature]], and ''P'' is the pressure (in [[Pascal (unit)|pascals]]). 

Solving for ''V/n'', we thus obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{n}=\frac{RT}{P}&lt;/math&gt;.
Comparing we have
:&lt;math&gt;k=\frac{RT}{P}&lt;/math&gt;
which is a constant for a fixed pressure and a fixed temperature.

An equivalent formulation of the ideal gas law can be written using [[Boltzmann constant]] ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, as
:&lt;math&gt;PV=Nk_{\rm B}T&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''N'' is the number of particles in the gas, and the ratio of ''R'' over ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;  is equal to [[Avogadro constant]].

In this form, for  ''V/N'' is a constant, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{N}=k'=\frac{k_{\rm B}T}{P}&lt;/math&gt;.
If ''T'' and ''P'' are taken at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]] (STP), then ''k''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'=1/''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Loschmidt constant]].

==Historical account and influence==
'''Avogadro's hypothesis''' (as it was known originally) was formulated in the same spirit of earlier empirical gas laws like [[Boyle's law]] (1662), [[Charles's law]] (1787)  and [[Gay-Lussac's law]] (1808). The hypothesis was first published by Amadeo Avogadro in 1811,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Avogadro|first=Amadeo|date=July 1811|title=Essai d’une maniere de determiner les masses relatives des molecules elementaires des corps, et les proportions selon lesquelles elles entrent dans ces combinaisons|url=|journal=Journal de physique, de chimie, et d'histoire naturelle|language=French|volume=73|pages=58--76|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and reconciled [[Dalton atomic theory]] with the "incompatible" idea of [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] that some gases were composite of different fundamental substances (molecules) in integer proportions.&lt;ref name="Hypothesis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/AvogadrosHypothesis.html|title=Avogadro's Hypothesis|last=Rovnyak|first=David|date=|website=Science World Wolfram|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814, independently from Avogadro, [[André-Marie Ampère]] published the same law with similar conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ampère|first=André-Marie|author-link=André-Marie Ampère|date=1814|title=Lettre de M. Ampère à M. le comte Berthollet sur la détermination des proportions dans lesquelles les corps se combinent d'après le nombre et la disposition respective des molécules dont les parties intégrantes sont composées|url=|journal=Annales de chimie|language=French|volume=90|issue=1|pages=43-86|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Ampère was more well-known in France, the hypothesis was usually referred there as '''Ampère's hypothesis''',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;First used by [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]] in 1826.&lt;/ref&gt; and later also as '''Avogadro-Ampère hypothesis'''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;First used by [[Stanislao Cannizzaro]] in 1858.&lt;/ref&gt; or even '''Ampère-Avogadro hypothesis'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheidecker-Chevallier|first=Myriam|date=1997|title=L'hypothèse d'Avogadro (1811) et d'Ampère (1814): la distinction atome/molécule et la théorie de la combinaison chimique|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23633274?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=Revue d'histoire des sciences|language=French|volume=|pages=159--194|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental studies carried out by [[Charles Frédéric Gerhardt]] and [[Auguste Laurent]] on [[organic chemistry]] demonstrated that Avogadro's law explained why the same quantities of molecules in a gas have the same volume. Nevertheless, related experiments with some inorganic substances showed seeming exceptions to the law. This apparent contradiction was finally resolved by [[Stanislao Cannizzaro]], as announced at [[Karlsruhe Congress]] in 1860, four years after Avogadro's death. He explained that these exceptions were due to  molecular dissociations at certain temperatures, and that Avogadro's law determined not only molecular masses, but atomic masses as well. 

=== Ideal gas law ===
The [[combined gas law]] (the combination of Boyle, Charles and Gay-Lussac laws), together with Avogadro's law, were combined by [[Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron|Émile Clapeyron]] in 1834,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clayperon|first=Émile|author-link=Émile Claperyon|date=1834|title=Mémoire sur la puissance motrice de la chaleur|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k4336791/f157.table|journal=Journal de l'École Polytechnique|language=French|volume=XIV|pages=153–190|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving rise to the ideal gas law. At the end of the 19th century, later developments from scientists like [[August Krönig]], [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], gave rise to the [[kinetic theory of gases]], a microscopic theory from which the ideal gas law can be derived as an statistical result from the movement of atoms/molecules in a gas.

=== Avogadro's constant ===
Avogadro's law provides a way to calculate the quantity of gas in a receptacle. Thanks to this discovery, [[Johann Josef Loschmidt]], in 1865, was able for the first time to estimate the size of a molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loschmidt|first=J.|authorlink=Johann Josef Loschmidt|year=1865|title=Zur Grösse der Luftmoleküle|journal=Sitzungsberichte der kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften Wien|volume=52|issue=2|pages=395–413}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20060207130125/http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Loschmidt-1865.html English translation].&lt;/ref&gt; His calculation gave rise to the concept of the [[Loschmidt constant]], a ratio between macroscopic and atomic quantities. In 1910, [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Millikan's]] [[oil drop experiment]], determines the [[Elementary charge|charge]] of the [[electron]], together with [[Faraday constant]] (derived by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1834), one is able to determine the number of particles in a [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of substance. At the same time, precision experiments by [[Jean Baptiste Perrin]], lead to the definition of Avogadro number, to refer to the number of molecules in one [[gram-molecule]] of [[oxygen]]. Perrin named the number to honor Avogadro, for his discovery of the namesake law. Later standardization of the [[International System of Units]], lead to the modern definition of the [[Avogadro constant]].

==Molar volume==
{{main|Molar volume}}
Taking STP to be 101.325 [[kPa]] and 273.15 K, we can find the volume of one mole of gas:

:&lt;math&gt;V_{\rm m} = \frac{V}{n} = \frac{RT}{P} = \frac{(8.314 \;\mathrm{J} \mathrm{ mol}^{-1} \mathrm{ K}^{-1})(273.15\; \mathrm{ K})}{101.325 \;\mathrm{ kPa}} = 22.41 \;\mathrm{ dm}^3 \mathrm{ mol}^{-1}  = 22.41\; \mathrm{ liters}/ \mathrm{ mol}&lt;/math&gt;

For 100.00 kPa and 273.15 K, the molar volume of an ideal gas is 22.712 dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[File:NaCl polyhedra.png|thumb|Sodium chloride is a famous binary phase.  It features two elements: Na and Cl.]]
In [[materials chemistry]], a '''binary phase''' is [[chemical compound]] containing two different elements. Some binary phases compounds are molecular, e.g. [[carbon tetrachloride]] (CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). More typically binary phase refers to extended solids.  Famous examples are the two polymorphs of [[zinc sulfide]].&lt;ref name=earnshaw&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phases with higher degrees of complexity feature more elements, e.g. three elements in [[ternary phase]]s, four elements in [[quaternary phase]]s,

The '''Bohr radius''' (''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or ''r''&lt;sub&gt;Bohr&lt;/sub&gt;) is a [[physical constant]], approximately equal to the most probable distance between the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] and the [[electron]] in a [[hydrogen atom]] in its [[ground state]]. It is named after [[Niels Bohr]], due to its role in the [[Bohr model]] of an atom. Its value is {{val|5.2917721067|(12)|e=-11|u=m}}.&lt;ref name=codata/&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="uncert"/&gt;

== Definition and value ==

In [[SI units]] the Bohr radius is:&lt;ref&gt;[[David J. Griffiths]], ''Introduction to Quantum Mechanics'', Prentice-Hall, 1995, p. 137. {{ISBN|0-13-124405-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_0 = \frac{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar^2}{m_{\mathrm{e}} e^2} = \frac{\hbar}{m_{\mathrm{e}}\,c\,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is the Bohr radius,
:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_0 \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[permittivity of free space]],
:&lt;math&gt; \hbar \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck's constant]],
:&lt;math&gt; m_{\mathrm{e}} \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[mass of electron|electron rest mass]],
:&lt;math&gt; e \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[elementary charge]],
:&lt;math&gt; c \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, and
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[fine structure constant]].

In [[Gaussian units]] the Bohr radius is simply
:&lt;math&gt;a_0=\frac{\hbar^2}{m_e e^2}&lt;/math&gt;

According to 2014 [[CODATA]] the Bohr radius has a value of (considering mass of electron as the rest mass of an electron) {{val|5.2917721067|(12)|e=-11|u=m}} (i.e., approximately 53&amp;nbsp;[[picometre|pm]] or 0.53&amp;nbsp;[[angstrom|Å]]).&lt;ref name="codata"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?bohrrada0|title = CODATA Value: Bohr radius|author = |work = Fundamental Physical Constants|publisher = [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]|accessdate = 13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="uncert"&gt;The number in parenthesis denotes the [[Standard deviation|uncertainty]] of the last digits.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
In the [[Bohr model]] of the structure of an [[atom]], put forward by [[Niels Bohr]] in 1913, [[electrons]] orbit a central [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. The model says that the electrons orbit only at certain distances from the nucleus, depending on their energy.  In the simplest atom, [[hydrogen]], a single electron orbits the nucleus and its smallest possible orbit, with lowest energy, has an orbital radius almost equal to the Bohr radius. (It is not ''exactly'' the Bohr radius due to the [[reduced mass|reduced mass effect]]. They differ by about 0.1%.){{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Although the Bohr model is no longer in use, the Bohr radius remains very useful in [[atomic physics]] calculations, due in part to its simple relationship with other fundamental constants. (This is why it is defined using the true electron mass rather than the reduced mass, as mentioned above.) For example, it is the unit of length in [[atomic units]].

An important distinction is that the Bohr radius gives the position of maximum probability density,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zettili|first1=Nouredine|title=Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications|date=2009|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester|isbn=978-0-470-02678-6|page=376|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; not its '''expected''' radial distance. The [[Expected value|expected]] radial distance is actually 1.5 times the Bohr radius, as a result of the long tail of the radial wave function.

== Related units ==
The Bohr radius of the electron is one of a trio of related units of length, the other two being the [[Compton wavelength]] of the electron &lt;math&gt; \lambda_{\mathrm{e}} &lt;/math&gt; and the [[classical electron radius]] &lt;math&gt; r_{\mathrm{e}} &lt;/math&gt;.  The Bohr radius is built from the [[electron mass]] &lt;math&gt;m_{\mathrm{e}}&lt;/math&gt;, [[Planck's constant]] &lt;math&gt; \hbar &lt;/math&gt; and the [[electron charge]] &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt;.  The Compton wavelength is built from &lt;math&gt; m_{\mathrm{e}} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \hbar &lt;/math&gt; and the speed of light &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt;.  The classical electron radius is built from &lt;math&gt; m_{\mathrm{e}} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt;.  Any one of these three lengths can be written in terms of any other using the fine structure constant &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;r_{\mathrm{e}} = \alpha \frac{\lambda_{\mathrm{e}}}{2\pi} = \alpha^2 a_0.&lt;/math&gt;

The Compton wavelength is about 20 times smaller than the Bohr radius, and the classical electron radius is about 1000 times smaller than the Compton wavelength.

==Reduced Bohr radius==
The Bohr radius including the effect of [[reduced mass]] in the hydrogen atom can be given by the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt; \ a_0^* \ = \frac{\lambda_{\mathrm{p}} + \lambda_{\mathrm{e}}}{2\pi\alpha},&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_{\mathrm{p}} \ &lt;/math&gt; is the Compton wavelength of the [[proton]].
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_{\mathrm{e}} \ &lt;/math&gt; is the Compton wavelength of the electron.
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha \ &lt;/math&gt; is the fine structure constant.

In the above equation, the effect of the [[reduced mass]] is achieved by using the increased Compton wavelength, which is just the Compton wavelengths of the electron and the proton added together.

'''Bombardier Glacier''' ({{Coord|64|19|S|59|59|W|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]] draining southeast from the edge of [[Detroit Plateau]] on [[Nordenskjöld Coast]] in [[Graham Land]], [[Antarctica]] and through a deep trough between [[Darzalas Peak]] and [[Trave Peak]] to join [[Edgeworth Glacier]] and flow into [[Mundraga Bay]]. It was mapped from surveys by the [[Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey]] (1960–1961), and named by the [[UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee]] for [[Joseph-Armand Bombardier]], the Canadian engineer who developed the [[snowmobile]] from 1926 to 1937, one of the earliest successful self-propelled over-snow vehicles.

== History ==
The Breakthrough Initiatives were announced to the public on July 20, 2015, at London's [[Royal Society]].
Physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], Russian tycoon [[Yuri Milner]], and others created the ''Initiatives'' to search for intelligent extraterrestrial life in the Universe and consider a plan for possibly transmitting messages out into [[outer space|space]].&lt;ref name=washingtonp1&gt;

The announcement included an open letter co-signed by multiple scientists, including Hawking, expressing support for an intensified search for alien radio communications.

The first caesium clock was built by [[Louis Essen]] in 1955 at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal

Caesium [[atomic clock]]s are the most accurate time and frequency standards, and serve as the [[primary standard]] for the definition of the [[second]] in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) (the [[metric system]]). By definition, radiation produced by the transition between the two hyperfine ground states of caesium (in the absence of external influences such as the Earth's magnetic field) has a frequency, {{math|Δ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;Cs&lt;/sub&gt;}}, of exactly 9,192,631,770 [[Hertz|Hz]].  That value was chosen so that the caesium second equalled, to the limit of human measuring ability in 1960 when it was adopted, the existing standard [[ephemeris second]] based on the [[Earth]]'s orbit around the [[Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Markowitz | first1 = W. | last2 = Hall | first2 = R. | last3 = Essen | first3 = L. | last4 = Parry | first4 = J. | title = Frequency of Cesium in Terms of Ephemeris Time | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.1.105 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 105 | year = 1958 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1958PhRvL...1..105M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because no other measurement involving time had been as precise, the effect of the change was less than the experimental uncertainty of all existing measurements.

== Technical details ==
The official definition of the [[second]] given by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures|BIPM]] at the 13th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] in 1967 is: ``''The second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom.''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; At its 1997 meeting the BIPM added to the previous definition the following specification: ``''This definition refers to a caesium atom at rest at a temperature of 0 K.''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The meaning of the preceding definition is as follows. The caesium atom has a ground state electron state with [[Electron configuration|configuration]] [Xe] 6s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and, consequently, [[Term symbol|atomic term symbol]] &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;. This means that there is one unpaired electron and the total electron spin of the atom is 1/2. Moreover, the nucleus of caesium-133 has a nuclear spin equal to 7/2. The simultaneous presence of electron spin and nuclear spin leads, by a mechanism called [[Hyperfine structure|hyperfine interaction]], to a (small) splitting of all energy levels into two sub-levels. One of the sub-levels corresponds to the electron and nuclear spin being parallel (i.e., pointing in the same direction), leading to a total spin ''F'' equal to ''F''=7/2+1/2 =4; the other sub-level corresponds to anti-parallel electron and nuclear spin (i.e., pointing in opposite directions), leading to a total spin ''F''=7/2-1/2=3. In the caesium atom it so happens that the sub-level lowest in energy is the one with F=3, while the F=4 sub-level lies energetically slightly above. When the atom is irradiated with electromagnetic radiation having an energy corresponding to the energetic difference between the two sub-levels the radiation is absorbed and the atom is excited, going from the ''F''=3 sub-level to the ''F''=4 one. After a small fraction of a second the atom will re-emit the radiation and return to its ''F''=3 ground state. From the definition of the second it follows that the radiation in question has a frequency of exactly 9.19263177 GHz, corresponding to a [[Electromagnetic spectrum|wavelength]] of about 3.26 cm and therefore belonging to the [[microwave]] range.

'''Corrosion Engineering''' is the specialist discipline of applying scientific knowledge, natural laws and physical resources in order to design and implement materials, structures, devices, systems and procedures to manage the natural phenomenon known as corrosion.  Generally related to [[Metallurgy]] or [[Materials Science]], Corrosion Engineering also relates to non-metallics including ceramics, cement, and conductive materials such as carbon / graphite.  Corrosion Engineers often manage other not-strictly-corrosion processes including (but not restricted to) cracking, brittle fracture, crazing, fretting, erosion, and more typically categorized as asset management. In the 1990s, Imperial College London even offered a Master of Science degree entitled "The Corrosion of Engineering Materials" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sidky and Hocking|first=|date=May 1994|title=MSc Corrosion of Engineering Materials|url=|journal=Imperial College Lecture Notes|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In the year 1995, it was reported that the costs nationwide in the U.S of corrosion were nearly $300 billion per year. [4]

[[Corrosion]] engineering groups have formed around the world in order to prevent, slow and manage the effects of corrosion.  Examples of such groups are the [[National Association of Corrosion Engineers]] (NACE) and the European Federation of Corrosion (EFC), see [[Corrosion societies]].  The corrosion engineers main task is to economically and safely manage the effects of corrosion on materials. Corrosion Engineering master's degree courses are available worldwide and are concerned with the control and understanding of corrosion.

Zaki Ahmad in his book "Principles of corrosion engineering and corrosion control"(10)states that "Corrosion engineering is the application of the principles evolved from corrosion science to minimize or prevent corrosion. Corrosion engineering involves designing of corrosion prevention schemes and implementation of specific codes and practices. Corrosion prevention measures, like cathodic protection, designing to prevent corrosion and coating of structures fall within the regime of corrosion engineering.  However, corrosion science and engineering go hand-in-hand and they cannot be separated: it is a permanent marriage to produce new and better methods of protection from time to time". In the "Handbook of corrosion engineering" (4) the author Pierre R. Roberge states "Corrosion is the destructive attack of a material by reaction with its environment.  The serious consequences of the corrosion process have become a problem of worldwide significance".

Most notable contributors to Corrosion Engineering education have been:

•[[Michael Faraday]] (1791–1867)

•[[Marcel Pourbaix]] (1904–1998)

•[[Melvin Romanoff]]

•[[Pierre R. Roberge]]

•[[Mars G. Fontana]] (1910–1988)

•[[Dr. Herbert H. Uhlig]] (1907–1993)

•[[Ulick Richardson Evans]] (1889–1980)

== Types of corrosion situations ==
Corrosion engineers and consultants tend to specialize in Internal or External corrosion scenarios.  In both, they may provide corrosion control recommendations, failure analysis investigations, sell corrosion control products, or provide installation or design of corrosion control and monitoring systems. Every material has its weakness.  Aluminum, galvanized/zinc coatings, brass, and copper do not survive well in very alkaline or very acidic pH environments. Copper and brasses do not survive well in high nitrate or ammonia environments.  Carbon steels and iron do not survive well in low [[soil resistivity]] and high chloride environments. High chloride environments can even overcome and attack steel encased in normally protective concrete. Concrete does not survive well in high sulfate environments.  And nothing survives well in high sulfide and low redox potential environments with corrosive bacteria.

=== External corrosion ===

==== Underground soil side corrosion     ====
Underground corrosion control engineers will collect soil samples to test soil chemistry for corrosive factors such as pH, minimum soil resistivity, chlorides, sulfates, ammonia, nitrates, sulfide, and redox potential.  The soil samples are collected from the depth from which the infrastructure will be installed because soil properties can change from strata to strata.  The minimum test of in-situ soil resistivity is measured using the Wenner 4 pin method if often performed to judge a site's corrosivity, but if the test is performed during a dry period, the soil's actual corrosivity may not be properly reported since underground condensation can occur on buried metals leaving the soil touching the metal surfaces in a more moist status.  This is why measuring a soil's minimum or saturated resistivity is so important.  Soil resistivity testing alone will also not identify corrosive elements.&lt;ref&gt;http://projectxcorrosion.com/sample-collection-tips/&lt;/ref&gt; Corrosion engineers can investigate locations experiencing active corrosion using above ground survey methods and design corrosion control systems such as cathodic protection to stop or reduce the rate of corrosion.

Geotechnical engineers typically do not practice corrosion engineering and will refer their clients to a corrosion engineer if the soil resistivity is measured to be below 3,000 ohm-cm or less depending which soil corrosivity categorization table they are reading. Unfortunately, an old dairy farm can have soil resistivities above 3,000 ohm-cm and still contain corrosive ammonia and nitrate levels which will lead to corrosion of copper piping or grounding rods. A general saying about corrosion is, "If the soil is great for farming, it is great for corrosion!"

==== Underwater external corrosion    ====
Underwater corrosion engineers apply the same principals used in underground corrosion control but will use specially trained and certified scuba divers for condition assessment, and corrosion control system installation and commissioning.  The main difference being in the type of reference cells used to collect voltage readings.

==== Atmospheric corrosion    ====
Atmospheric corrosion is typically handled by use of materials selection and coatings specifications.  The use of zinc coatings also known as galvanizing on steel structures is a form of cathodic protection in which small scratches are expected to occur in the coating over time.  As long as the scratches are fine, condensation moisture should not corrode the underlying steel as long as both the zinc and steel are in contact with the moisture, but if the scratch or uncoated area is larger than the droplets, then corrosion can occur.  As long as there is moisture, the zinc will corrode and eventually disappear.[[File:Side view Crow Hall Railway Bridge north of Preston Lancs corroding - general.jpg|thumb|Side view Crow Hall Railway Bridge north of Preston Lancs corroding - general]]

==== Humid and splash zone corrosion ====
[[File:Courtney Campbell Causeway with noticeable pile jackets on pilings.jpg|thumb|'Pile jackets' encasing old concrete [[Pile bridge|bridge pilings]] to combat the corrosion that occurs when cracks in the pilings allow saltwater to contact internal steel reinforcement rods]]
A significant amount of corrosion of fences is due to landscaper tools scratching fence coatings and irrigation sprinklers spraying these damaged fences.  Recycled water typically has a higher salt content than potable drinking water, meaning that it is more corrosive than regular tap water.  The same risk from damage and water spray exists for above ground piping and backflow preventers.  Fiberglass covers, cages, and concrete footings have worked well to keep tools at an arm’s length. Even the location where your roof drain splashes down can matter.  Drainage from a home’s roof valley can fall directly down onto a gas meter causing its piping to corrode at an accelerated rate reaching 50% wall thickness within 4 years.  It is the same effect as a splash zone in the ocean or in a pool which has a lot of oxygen and agitation that can remove material as it corrodes.

Tanks or structural tubing such as bench seat supports or amusement park rides can accumulate water and moisture if the structure does not allow for drainage.  This humid environment can then lead to internal corrosion of the structure affecting the structural integrity. The same can happen in tropical environments leading to external corrosion.

=== Internal corrosion ===
The same principals of external corrosion control can be applied to internal corrosion but due to accessibility, the approaches can be different.  Thus special instruments for internal corrosion control and inspection are used that are not used in external corrosion control.  Video scoping of pipes and high tech smart pigs are used for internal inspections.  The smart pigs can be inserted into a pipe system at one point and "caught" far down the line. The use of corrosion inhibitors, material selection, and internal coatings are mainly used to control corrosion in piping while anodes along with coatings are used to control corrosion in tanks.

Internal corrosion challenges apply to the following:

- Water pipe corrosion

- Gas pipe corrosion

- Oil pipe corrosion

- Water tank reservoir corrosion

{{details|topic=this zone|Demersal fish}}
{{ocean habitat topics|image=Stingray.jpg|caption=This [[bluespotted ribbontail ray]] lives in the demersal zone on or just above the [[seafloor]].}}

The '''demersal zone''' is the part of the [[sea]] or [[ocean]] (or deep [[lake]]) consisting of the part of the [[water column]] near to (and significantly affected by) the [[seabed]] and the [[benthos]].&lt;ref name=Merrett&gt;{{cite book|last=Merrett|first=N.R.|title=Deep-Sea Demersal Fish and Fisheries|year=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=0412394103|pages=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demersal zone is just above the [[benthic zone]] and forms a layer of the larger [[profundal zone]].

Being just above the ocean floor, the demersal zone is variable in depth and can be part of the [[photic zone]] where light can penetrate and photosynthetic organisms grow, or the [[aphotic zone]], which begins between depths of roughly {{convert|200|and|1000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} and extends to the ocean depths, where no light penetrates.&lt;ref name=Merrett/&gt;

==Fish==
{{main|Demersal fish}}

The distinction between demersal species of fish and [[Pelagic fish|pelagic species]] is not always clear cut. The [[Atlantic cod]] (''Gadus morhua'') is a typical [[demersal fish]], but can also be found in the open [[water column]], and the [[Atlantic herring]] (''Clupea harengus'') is predominantly a pelagic species but forms large aggregations near the seabed when it spawns on banks of gravel.&lt;ref name=Steele&gt;{{cite book|author=Steele, John H.|title=Marine Policy &amp; Economics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQ6hCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91 |year=2010 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-12-378558-9 |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two types of fish inhabit the demersal zone, those that are heavier than water and rest on the seabed, and those that have neutral buoyancy and remain just above the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]. In many species of fish, neutral buoyancy is maintained by a gas-filled [[swim bladder]] which can be expanded or contracted as the circumstances require. A disadvantage of this method is that adjustments need to be made constantly as the water pressure varies when the fish swims higher and lower in the water column. An alternative buoyancy aid is the use of lipids, which are less dense than water—[[squalene]], commonly found in shark livers, has a specific gravity of just 0.86. In the [[velvet belly lanternshark]] (''Etmopterus spinax''), a [[Demersal fish#Benthopelagic fish|benthopelagic]] species, 17 % of the bodyweight is liver of which 70 % are lipids. Benthic rays and skates have smaller livers with lower concentrations of lipids; they are therefore denser than water and they do not swim continuously, intermittently resting on the seabed.&lt;ref name=Schmidt&gt;{{cite book|author=Schmidt-Nielsen, Knut| title=Animal Physiology: Adaptation and Environment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Af7IwQWJoCMC&amp;pg=PA445 |year=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57098-5 |pages=445–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fish have no buoyancy aids but use their pectoral fins which are so angled as to give lift as they swim. The disadvantage of this is that, if they stop swimming, the fish sink, and they cannot hover, or swim backwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/212_fall2003.web.dir/Marshall_Heaster/Fish_Buoyancy.html |title=Buoyancy |author=Newman, David|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demersal fish have various feeding strategies; many feed on [[zooplankton]] or organisms or algae on the seabed; some of these feed on [[Fauna#Epifauna|epifauna]] (invertebrates on top of the seafloor), while others specialise on [[Fauna#Infauna|infauna]] (invertebrates that burrow beneath the seafloor). Others are scavengers, eating the dead remains of plants or animals while still others are [[Predation|predators]].&lt;ref name="Sedberry"&gt;Sedberry, G.R.; Musick, J.A. (1978) [http://www.springerlink.com/content/g1684h788800708p/ "Feeding strategies of some demersal fishes of the continental slope and rise off the mid-Atlantic coast of the USA"] ''Marine Biology'', '''44''':357–375.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invertebrates==
Zooplankton are animals that drift with the current, but many have some limited means of locomotion and have some control over the depths at which they drift. They use gas-filled sacs or accumulations of substances with low densities to provide buoyancy, or they may have structures that slow down any passive descent. Where the adult, benthic organism is limited to life in a certain range of depths, their larvae need to optimise their chances of settling on a suitable substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Power, James H.|year=1989 |title=Sink or Swim: Growth Dynamics and Zooplankton Hydromechanics  |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=133 |issue=5 |pages=706–721 |jstor=2462076 |doi=10.1086/284946}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Cuttlefish]] are able to adjust their buoyancy using their [[cuttlebone]]s, lightweight rigid structures with cavities filled with gas, which have a specific gravity of about 0.6. This enables them to swim at varying depths. Another invertebrate that feeds on the seabed and has swimming abilities is the [[nautilus]], which stores gas in its chambers and adjusts its buoyancy by use of [[osmosis]], pumping water in and out.&lt;ref name=Schmidt/&gt;

'''Electrical engineering''' is a [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|professional engineering]] discipline that generally deals with the study and application of [[electricity]], [[electronics]], and [[electromagnetism]]. This field first became an identifiable occupation in the later half of the 19th century after [[commercialization]] of the electric [[telegraph]], the [[telephone]], and [[electric power]] distribution and use. Subsequently, [[broadcasting]] and [[recording media]] made electronics part of daily life.  The invention of the [[transistor]], and later the [[integrated circuit]], brought down the cost of electronics to the point they can be used in almost any household object.

Electrical engineering has now subdivided into a wide range of subfields including [[electronics]], [[digital computers]], [[computer engineering]], [[power engineering]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[control system]]s, [[radio-frequency engineering]], [[signal processing]], [[instrumentation]], and [[microelectronics]]. Many of these subdisciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations such as hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics &amp; waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics, electrical materials science, and much more. See [[glossary of electrical and electronics engineering]].

Electrical engineers typically hold a [[academic degree|degree]] in electrical engineering or electronic engineering.  Practicing engineers may have [[professional certification]] and be members of a [[professional body]]. Such bodies include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET) ''(formerly the IEE)''.

Electrical engineers work in a very wide range of industries and the skills required are likewise variable. These range from basic circuit theory to the management skills required of a [[project manager]].  The tools and equipment that an individual engineer may need are similarly variable, ranging from a simple [[voltmeter]] to a top end analyzer to sophisticated design and manufacturing software.

==History==
{{Main article|History of electrical engineering}}

[[Electricity]] has been a subject of scientific interest since at least the early [[17th century]].  [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] was a prominent early electrical scientist, and was the first to draw a clear distinction between [[magnetism]] and [[static electricity]]. He is credited with establishing the term "electricity".{{sfn|Martinsen|Grimnes|2011|p=411}} He also designed the [[versorium]]: a device that detects the presence of statically charged objects. In 1762 Swedish professor [[Johan Carl Wilcke]] invented a device later named [[electrophorus]] that produced a static electric charge. By 1800 [[Alessandro Volta]] had developed the [[voltaic pile]], a forerunner of the electric battery

===19th century===
[[File:Faraday Cochran Pickersgill.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The discoveries of [[Michael Faraday]] formed the foundation of electric motor technology]]
In the 19th century, research into the subject started to intensify. Notable developments in this century include the work of [[Georg Ohm]], who in 1827 quantified the relationship between the [[electric current]] and [[potential difference]] in a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], of [[Michael Faraday]] (the discoverer of [[electromagnetic induction]] in 1831), and of [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who in 1873 published a unified [[Maxwell's equations|theory]] of electricity and [[magnetism]] in his treatise ''Electricity and Magnetism''.{{sfn|Lambourne|2010|p=11}}

Electrical engineering became a profession in the later 19th century.  Practitioners had created a global [[electric telegraph]] network and the first professional electrical engineering institutions were founded in the UK and USA to support the new discipline.  Although it is impossible to precisely pinpoint a first electrical engineer, [[Francis Ronalds]] stands ahead of the field, who created the first working electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=2016|title=Sir Francis Ronalds and the Electric Telegraph|url=|journal=Int.

Practical applications and advances in such fields created an increasing need for standardised [[units of measure]]. They led to the international standardization of the units [[volt]], [[ampere]], [[coulomb]], [[ohm]], [[farad]], and [[henry (unit)|henry]]. This was achieved at an international conference in Chicago in 1893.{{Sfn|Rosenberg|2008|p=9}} The publication of these standards formed the basis of future advances in standardisation in various industries, and in many countries, the definitions were immediately recognized in relevant legislation.{{sfn|Tunbridge|1992}}

During these years, the study of electricity was largely considered to be a subfield of [[physics]] since the early electrical technology was considered [[electromechanical]] in nature. The [[Technische Universität Darmstadt]] founded the world's first department of electrical engineering in 1882. The first electrical engineering degree program was started at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in the physics department under Professor Charles Cross, {{Sfn|Wildes|Lindgren|1985|p=19}} though it was [[Cornell University]] to produce the world's first electrical engineering graduates in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/about/history.cfm|title=History - School of Electrical and Computer Engineering - Cornell Engineering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first course in electrical engineering was taught in 1883 in Cornell’s [[Cornell University College of Engineering|Sibley College of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanic Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/about/upload/Cornell-Engineering-history.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until about 1885 that [[Cornell University|Cornell]] President [[Andrew Dickson White]] established the first Department of Electrical Engineering in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://president.cornell.edu/andrew-dickson-white/|title=Andrew Dickson White - Office of the President|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[University College London]] founded the first chair of electrical engineering in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Electrical Engineer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLLmAAAAMAAJ|year=1911|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Mendell P. Weinbach at [[University of Missouri]] soon followed suit by establishing the electrical engineering department in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.missouri.edu/ece/about/department-history/|title=Department History - Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, [[universities]] and [[institutes of technology]] gradually started to offer electrical engineering programs to their students all over the world.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During these decades use of electrical engineering increased dramatically. In 1882, [[Thomas Edison]] switched on the world's first large-scale electric power network that provided 110 volts — [[direct current]] (DC) — to 59 customers on [[Manhattan Island]] in [[New York City]]. In 1884, [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Sir Charles Parsons]] invented the [[steam turbine]] allowing for more efficient electric power generation. [[Alternating current]], with its ability to transmit power more efficiently over long distances via the use of [[transformer]]s,  developed rapidly in the 1880s and 1890s with transformer designs by [[Károly Zipernowsky]], [[Ottó Bláthy]] and [[Miksa Déri]] (later called ZBD transformers), [[Lucien Gaulard]], [[John Dixon Gibbs]] and [[William Stanley, Jr.]]. Practical [[AC motor]] designs including [[induction motor]]s were independently invented by [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Nikola Tesla]] and further developed into a practical [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] form by [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] and [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown]].{{Sfn|Heertje|Perlman|1990|p=138}} [[Charles Steinmetz]] and [[Oliver Heaviside]] contributed to the theoretical basis of alternating current engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=f5FqsDPVQ2MC&amp;pg=PA1229&amp;dq=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Oliver%20Heaviside#v=onepage&amp;q=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Oliver%20Heaviside&amp;f=false|title=Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences|first=I.|last=Grattan-Guinness|date=1 January 2003|publisher=JHU Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780801873973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lew5IC5piCwC&amp;pg=PA329&amp;dq=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Charles%20Steinmetz#v=onepage&amp;q=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Charles%20Steinmetz&amp;f=false|title=Mathematics in Historical Context|first=Jeff|last=Suzuki|date=27 August 2009|publisher=MAA|via=Google Books|isbn=9780883855706}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread in the use of AC set off in the United States what has been called the ''[[War of Currents]]'' between a [[George Westinghouse]] backed AC system and a Thomas Edison backed DC power system, with AC being adopted as the overall standard.{{sfn|Severs|Leise|2011|p=145}}

===More modern developments===
[[File:Guglielmo Marconi.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Guglielmo Marconi]] known for his pioneering work on long distance radio transmission]]
During the [[invention of radio|development of radio]], many scientists and [[inventor]]s contributed to [[radio communications|radio technology]] and electronics. The mathematical work of [[James Clerk Maxwell]] during the 1850s had shown the relationship of different forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]] including possibility of invisible airborne waves (later called "radio waves"). In his classic physics experiments of 1888, [[Heinrich Hertz]] proved Maxwell's theory by transmitting [[radio wave]]s with a [[spark-gap transmitter]], and detected them by using simple electrical devices. Other physicists experimented with these new waves and in the process developed devices for transmitting and detecting them. In 1895, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] began work on a way to adapt the known methods of transmitting and detecting these "Hertzian waves" into a purpose built commercial [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless telegraphic]] system. Early on, he sent wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles. In December 1901, he sent wireless waves that were not affected by the curvature of the Earth. Marconi later transmitted the wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu, Cornwall, and St. John's, Newfoundland, a distance of {{convert|2100|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/marconi-bio.html Marconi's biography at Nobelprize.org] retrieved 21 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] introduced the [[cathode ray tube]] as part of an [[oscilloscope]], a crucial enabling technology for [[television|electronic television]].{{sfn|Abramson|1955|p=22}} [[John Ambrose Fleming|John Fleming]] invented the first radio tube, the [[diode]], in 1904. Two years later, [[Robert von Lieben]] and [[Lee De Forest]] independently developed the amplifier tube, called the [[triode]].{{Sfn|Huurdeman|2003|p=226}}

In 1920, [[Albert Hull]] developed the [[Cavity magnetron|magnetron]] which would eventually lead to the development of the [[microwave oven]] in 1946 by [[Percy Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Albert W.

The invention of the [[transistor]] in late 1947 by [[William Shockley]], [[John Bardeen]], and [[Walter Brattain]] of the [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] opened the door for more compact devices and led to the development of the [[integrated circuit]] in 1958 by [[Jack Kilby]] and independently in 1959 by [[Robert Noyce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Electronics Timeline | work = Greatest Engineering Achievements of the Twentieth Century | url = http://www.greatachievements.org/?id=3956 | accessdate =18 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[microprocessor]] was introduced with the [[Intel 4004]]. It began with the "[[Busicom]] Project"&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;[[Federico Faggin]], [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4776530 The Making of the First Microprocessor], ''IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine'', Winter 2009, [[IEEE Xplore]]&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Masatoshi Shima]]'s three-chip [[CPU]] design in 1968,&lt;ref name=tout1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/busicom_141-pf_and_intel_4004.html|title=The Busicom 141-PF calculator and the Intel 4004 microprocessor|author=Nigel Tout|accessdate=November 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; before [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]]'s [[Tadashi Sasaki (engineer)|Tadashi Sasaki]] conceived of a single-chip CPU design, which he discussed with Busicom and [[Intel]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="sasaki"&gt;{{cite web |url        = http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Tadashi_Sasaki |title      = Oral-History: Tadashi Sasaki |last       = Aspray |first      = William |date       = 1994-05-25 |work       = Interview #211 for the Center for the History of Electrical Engineering |publisher  = The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. |accessdate = 2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Intel 4004 was then developed as a single-chip microprocessor from 1969 to 1970, led by Intel's [[Marcian Hoff]] and [[Federico Faggin]] and Busicom's Masatoshi Shima.&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; The microprocessor led to the development of [[microcomputer]]s and [[personal computer]]s, and the [[microcomputer revolution]].

==Subdisciplines==
Electrical engineering has many subdisciplines, the most common of which are listed below. Although there are electrical engineers who focus exclusively on one of these subdisciplines, many deal with a combination of them. Sometimes certain fields, such as electronic engineering and [[computer engineering]], are considered separate disciplines in their own right.

===Power===
{{Main article|Power engineering}}
[[File:Power pole.jpg|thumb|right|[[Utility pole|Power pole]]]]
Power engineering deals with the [[electricity generation|generation]], [[electric power transmission|transmission]], and [[electric power distribution|distribution]] of [[electricity]] as well as the design of a range of related devices.{{Sfn|Grigsby|2012}} These include [[transformer]]s, [[electric generator]]s, [[electric motor]]s, high voltage engineering, and [[power electronics]]. In many regions of the world, governments maintain an electrical network called a [[power grid]] that connects a variety of generators together with users of their energy. Users purchase electrical energy from the grid, avoiding the costly exercise of having to generate their own. Power engineers may work on the design and maintenance of the power grid as well as the power systems that connect to it.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; Such systems are called ''on-grid'' power systems and may supply the grid with additional power, draw power from the grid, or do both. Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid, called ''off-grid'' power systems, which in some cases are preferable to on-grid systems. The future includes Satellite controlled power systems, with feedback in real time to prevent power surges and prevent blackouts.

===Control===
{{Main article|Control engineering|Automatic control|Control theory}}
[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|thumb|right|[[Control systems]] play a critical role in [[spaceflight]].]]
[[Control engineering]] focuses on the [[mathematical model|modeling]] of a diverse range of [[dynamic system]]s and the design of [[controller (control theory)|controllers]] that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner.{{sfn|Bissell|1996|p=17}} To implement such controllers, electrical engineers may use [[electronic circuit]]s, [[digital signal processor]]s, [[microcontroller]]s, and [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs). [[Control engineering]] has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of [[Airliner|commercial airliners]] to the [[cruise control]] present in many modern [[automobile]]s.{{sfn|McDavid|Echaore-McDavid|2009|p=95}} It also plays an important role in [[industrial automation]].

Control engineers often utilize [[feedback]] when designing [[control system]]s. For example, in an [[automobile]] with [[cruise control]] the vehicle's [[speed]] is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the [[Internal combustion engine|motor's]] [[Power (physics)|power]] output accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, [[control theory]] can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback.{{sfn|Fairman|1998|p=119}}

===Electronics===
{{Main article|Electronic engineering}}

[[File:Componentes.JPG|thumb|left|[[Electronic components]]]]
Electronic engineering involves the design and testing of [[electronic circuit]]s that use the properties of [[electrical element|components]] such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[diode]]s, and [[transistor]]s to achieve a particular functionality.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite book|title=Engineering: Issues, Challenges and Opportunities for Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09i67GgGPCYC&amp;pg=PA128|year=2010|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=978-92-3-104156-3|pages=127–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tuned circuit]], which allows the user of a [[radio]] to [[electronic filter|filter]] out all but a single station, is just one example of such a circuit. Another example to research is a pneumatic signal conditioner.

Prior to the Second World War, the subject was commonly known as ''radio engineering'' and basically was restricted to aspects of communications and [[radar]], [[radio|commercial radio]], and [[television|early television]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; Later, in post war years, as consumer devices began to be developed, the field grew to include modern television, audio systems, [[computer]]s, and [[microprocessors]]. In the mid-to-late 1950s, the term ''radio engineering'' gradually gave way to the name ''electronic engineering''.

Before the invention of the [[integrated circuit]] in 1959,{{Sfn|Thompson|2006|p=4}} electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans. These discrete circuits consumed much space and [[electric power|power]] and were limited in speed, although they are still common in some applications. By contrast, [[integrated circuit]]s packed a large number—often millions—of tiny electrical components, mainly [[transistor]]s,{{Sfn|Merhari|2009|p=233}} into a small chip around the size of a [[coin]]. This allowed for the powerful [[computer]]s and other electronic devices we see today.

===Microelectronics===
{{Main article|Microelectronics}}
[[File:80486dx2-large.jpg|thumb|right|[[Microprocessor]]]]
[[Microelectronics]] engineering deals with the design and [[microfabrication]] of very small electronic circuit components for use in an [[integrated circuit]] or sometimes for use on their own as a general electronic component.{{Sfn|Bhushan|1997|p=581}} The most common microelectronic components are [[semiconductor]] [[transistor]]s, although all main electronic components ([[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s etc.) can be created at a microscopic level. [[Nanoelectronics]] is the further scaling of devices down to [[nanometer]] levels. Modern devices are already in the nanometer regime, with below 100&amp;nbsp;nm processing having been standard since around 2002.{{Sfn|Mook|2008|p=149}}

Microelectronic components are created by chemically fabricating wafers of semiconductors such as silicon (at higher frequencies, [[compound semiconductor]]s like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide) to obtain the desired transport of electronic charge and control of current. The field of microelectronics involves a significant amount of chemistry and material science and requires the electronic engineer working in the field to have a very good working knowledge of the effects of [[quantum mechanics]].{{sfn|Sullivan|2012}}

===Signal processing===
{{Main article|Signal processing}}
[[File:Bayer pattern on sensor.svg|thumb|left|A [[Bayer filter]] on a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] requires signal processing to get a red, green, and blue value at each pixel.]]
[[Signal processing]] deals with the analysis and manipulation of [[signal (electrical engineering)|signals]].{{Sfn|Tuzlukov|2010|p=20}} Signals can be either [[analog signal|analog]], in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital]], in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information. For analog signals, signal processing may involve the [[amplifier|amplification]] and [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]] of audio signals for audio equipment or the [[modulation]] and [[demodulation]] of signals for [[telecommunication]]s. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the [[Data compression|compression]], [[error detection]] and [[error correction]] of digitally sampled signals.{{Sfn|Manolakis|Ingle|2011|p=17}}

Signal Processing is a very mathematically oriented and intensive area forming the core of [[digital signal processing]] and it is rapidly expanding with new applications in every field of electrical engineering such as communications, control, radar, [[audio engineer]]ing, [[broadcast engineering]], power electronics, and [[biomedical engineering]] as many already existing analog systems are replaced with their digital counterparts. [[Analog signal processing]] is still important in the design of many [[control system]]s.

DSP processor ICs are found in many types of modern electronic devices, such as digital [[television set]]s,{{sfn|Bayoumi|Swartzlander|1994|p=25}} radios, [[Hi-Fi]] audio equipment, mobile phones, [[Portable Media Player|multimedia players]], camcorders and digital cameras, automobile control systems, [[noise cancelling]] headphones, digital [[spectrum analyzer]]s, missile guidance systems, [[radar]] systems, and [[telematics]] systems. In such products, DSP may be responsible for [[noise reduction]], [[speech recognition]] or [[Speech synthesis|synthesis]], [[Codec|encoding or decoding]] digital media, wirelessly [[Transceiver|transmitting or receiving]] data, triangulating position using [[GPS]], and other kinds of [[image processing]], [[video processing]], [[audio signal processing|audio processing]], and [[speech processing]].{{Sfn|Khanna|2009|p=297}}

===Telecommunications===
{{Main article|Telecommunications engineering}}
[[File:Erdfunkstelle Raisting 2a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Satellite dish]]es are a crucial component in the analysis of satellite information.]]
[[Telecommunications|Telecommunications engineering]] focuses on the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[information]] across a [[communication channel]] such as a [[coax cable]], [[optical fiber]] or [[free space optical communications|free space]].{{sfn|Tobin|2007|p=15}} Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a [[carrier signal]] to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission; this is known as [[modulation]]. Popular analog modulation techniques include [[amplitude modulation]] and [[frequency modulation]].{{Sfn|Chandrasekhar|2006|p=21}} The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.

Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]] needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a [[transceiver]]. A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their [[power consumption]] as this is closely related to their [[signal strength]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=19}}{{sfn|Zhang|Hu|Luo|2007|p=448}} If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the signal's information will be corrupted by [[signal noise|noise]].

===Instrumentation===
{{Main article|Instrumentation engineering}}
[[File:F-18E cockpit m02006112600499.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flight instruments]] provide pilots with the tools to control aircraft analytically.]]
[[Instrumentation engineering]] deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as [[pressure]], [[Volumetric flow rate|flow]], and [[temperature]].{{Sfn|Grant|Bixley|2011|p=159}} The design of such instruments requires a good understanding of [[physics]] that often extends beyond [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic theory]]. For example, [[flight instruments]] measure variables such as [[wind speed]] and [[altitude]] to enable pilots the control of aircraft analytically. Similarly, [[thermocouple]]s use the [[Peltier-Seebeck effect]] to measure the temperature difference between two points.{{sfn|Fredlund|Rahardjo|Fredlund|2012|p=346}}

Often instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the [[sensor]]s of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manual on the Use of Thermocouples in Temperature Measurement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pos-MXDWb6MC&amp;pg=PA154|date=1 January 1993|publisher=ASTM International|isbn=978-0-8031-1466-1|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control.

===Computers===
{{Main article|Computer engineering}}
[[File:MEGWARE.CLIC.jpg|thumb|right|[[Supercomputer]]s are used in fields as diverse as [[computational biology]] and [[geographic information systems]].]]
Computer engineering deals with the design of [[computer]]s and [[computer system]]s. This may involve the design of new [[computer hardware|hardware]], the design of [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]], tablets, and [[supercomputers]], or the use of computers to control an [[manufacturing|industrial plant]].{{sfn|Obaidat|Denko|Woungang|2011|p=9}} Computer engineers may also work on a system's [[software]]. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of [[software engineering]], which is usually considered a separate discipline.{{sfn|Jalote|2006|p=22}} [[Desktop computer]]s represent a tiny fraction of the devices a computer engineer might work on, as computer-like architectures are now found in a range of devices including [[video game console]]s and [[DVD player]]s.

===Related disciplines===
[[File:VIP Bird2.jpg|thumb|left|The Bird VIP Infant ventilator]]
[[Mechatronics]] is an engineering discipline which deals with the convergence of electrical and [[machine|mechanical]] systems. Such combined systems are known as [[electromechanical]] systems and have widespread adoption. Examples include [[automation|automated manufacturing systems]],{{sfn|Mahalik|2003|p=569}} [[HVAC|heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems]],{{sfn|Leondes|2000|p=199}} and various subsystems of [[aircraft]] and [[automobile]]s.
{{sfn|Shetty|Kolk|2010|p=36}}
''Electronic systems design'' is the subject within electrical engineering that deals with the multi-disciplinary design issues of complex electrical and mechanical systems.&lt;ref name="lienig"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig|author2=H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|pp=1|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-55840-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''mechatronics'' is typically used to refer to [[macroscopic]] systems but [[Futures studies|futurists]] have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already, such small devices, known as [[Microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS), are used in automobiles to tell [[airbag]]s when to deploy,{{sfn|Maluf|Williams|2004|p=3}} in [[digital projector]]s to create sharper images, and in [[inkjet printer]]s to create nozzles for high definition printing. In the future it is hoped the devices will help build tiny implantable medical devices and improve [[optical communication]].{{Sfn|Iga|Kokubun|2010|p=137}}

[[Biomedical engineering]] is another related discipline, concerned with the design of [[medical equipment]]. This includes fixed equipment such as [[ventilator]]s, [[MRI|MRI scanners]],{{Sfn|Dodds|Kumar|Veering|2014|p=274}} and [[electrocardiograph|electrocardiograph monitors]] as well as mobile equipment such as [[cochlear implant]]s, [[artificial pacemaker]]s, and [[artificial heart]]s.

[[Aerospace engineering]] and [[robotics]] an example is the most recent [[electric propulsion]] and ion propulsion.

==Education==
{{Main article|Education and training of electrical and electronics engineers}}
[[File:Osciloscopio locomotora.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Oscilloscope]]]]
Electrical engineers typically possess an [[academic degree]] with a major in electrical engineering, [[electronics engineering]], [[electrical engineering technology]],&lt;ref name=BLS3&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronic Engineer|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm#tab-4|work=[[Occupational Outlook Handbook]], 2012-13 Edition|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or electrical and electronic engineering.{{Sfn|Chaturvedi|1997|p=253}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What is the difference between electrical and electronic engineering? | work = FAQs - Studying Electrical Engineering | url = http://www.ieee.org/portal/site/mainsite/menuitem.818c0c39e85ef176fb2275875bac26c8/index.jsp?&amp;pName=corp_level1&amp;path=education/faqs&amp;file=faqs1.xml&amp;xsl=generic.xsl | accessdate =20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same fundamental principles are taught in all programs, though emphasis may vary according to title. The length of study for such a degree is usually four or five years and the completed degree may be designated as a Bachelor of Science in Electrical/Electronics Engineering Technology, [[Bachelor of Engineering]], [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Bachelor of Technology]], or [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] depending on the university. The [[bachelor's degree]] generally includes units covering [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[project management]], and a [[list of electrical engineering topics|variety of topics in electrical engineering]].&lt;ref name="Enterprise1986"&gt;{{cite book|title=Computerworld|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVHbRM6mU9gC&amp;pg=PA97|date=25 August 1986|publisher=IDG Enterprise|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the subdisciplines of electrical engineering. At some schools, the students can then choose to emphasize one or more subdisciplines towards the end of their courses of study.

[[File:LM317 typical schematic.svg|thumb|left|An example [[circuit diagram]]. It is used as a powerful tool in [[troubleshooting]]. ]]

At many schools, electronic engineering is included as part of an electrical award, sometimes explicitly, such as a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and Electronic), but in others electrical and electronic engineering are both considered to be sufficiently broad and complex that separate degrees are offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronic Engineering|url=http://www.flinders.edu.au/science_engineering/csem/disciplines/eee/|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some electrical engineers choose to study for a postgraduate degree such as a [[Master of Engineering]]/[[Master of Science]] (M.Eng./M.Sc.), a Master of [[Engineering Management]], a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) in Engineering, an [[Engineering Doctorate]] (Eng.D.), or an [[Engineer's degree]]. The master's and engineer's degrees may consist of either [[research]], [[coursework]] or a mixture of the two. The Doctor of Philosophy and Engineering Doctorate degrees consist of a significant research component and are often viewed as the entry point to [[academia]]. In the United Kingdom and some other European countries, Master of Engineering is often considered to be an undergraduate degree of slightly longer duration than the Bachelor of Engineering rather than postgraduate.&lt;ref&gt;Various including graduate degree requirements [http://www.eecs.mit.edu/grad/degrees.html at MIT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116055044/http://www.eecs.mit.edu/grad/degrees.html |date=16 January 2006 }}, study guide [http://www.ecm.uwa.edu.au/students/study-guides-2012/be-elec-mech at UWA], the curriculum [http://www.queensu.ca/calendars/appsci/pg219.html at Queen's] and unit tables [http://www.abdn.ac.uk/registry/calendar/requirements/07H50116.doc at Aberdeen]&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards [[professional certification]] and the degree program itself is certified by a [[professional body]].&lt;ref name="Labor2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008–2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F4ZS7UQ1QZoC|date=1 March 2008|publisher=U S Department of Labor, Jist Works|isbn=978-1-59357-513-7|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience requirements) before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of [[Professional Engineer]] (in the United States, Canada and South Africa), [[Chartered engineer|Chartered Engineer]] or [[Incorporated Engineer]]  (in India, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Ireland and [[Zimbabwe]]), Chartered Professional Engineer (in Australia and New Zealand) or [[European Engineer]] (in much of the [[European Union]]).

[[File:3 Park Avenue.JPG|thumb|left|The [[IEEE]] corporate office is on the 17th floor of [[3 Park Avenue]] in [[New York City]]]]
The advantages of licensure vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada "only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work for public and private clients".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Why Should You Get Licensed? | work = National Society of Professional Engineers | url = http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | accessdate =11 July 2005 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050604085233/http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp| archivedate = 4 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as [[Quebec]]'s Engineers Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Engineers Act | work = Quebec Statutes and Regulations (CanLII) | url = http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=//I_9/I9_A.htm | accessdate =24 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a [[ethical code|code of ethics]] that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Codes of Ethics and Conduct | work = Online Ethics Center | url = http://onlineethics.org/CMS/profpractice/ethcodes.aspx | accessdate =24 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to [[contract law]]. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the [[negligence|tort of negligence]] and, in extreme cases, the charge of [[criminal negligence]]. An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations, such as [[building codes]] and legislation pertaining to [[environmental law]].

Professional bodies of note for electrical engineers include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET).  The IEEE claims to produce 30% of the world's literature in electrical engineering, has over 360,000 members worldwide and holds over 3,000 conferences annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the IEEE | work = IEEE | url = http://www.ieee.org/about/ | accessdate =11 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IET publishes 21 journals, has a worldwide membership of over 150,000, and claims to be the largest professional engineering society in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the IET | work = The IET | url = http://www.theiet.org/about/ | accessdate =11 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Journal and Magazines | work = The IET | url = http://www.theiet.org/publishing/journals/ | accessdate =11 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obsolescence of technical skills is a serious concern for electrical engineers. Membership and participation in technical societies, regular reviews of periodicals in the field and a habit of continued learning are therefore essential to maintaining proficiency. An MIET(Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology) is recognised in Europe as an Electrical and computer (technology) engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Electrical and Electronics Engineers, except Computer | work = Occupational Outlook Handbook | url = http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm | accessdate =16 July 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050713014728/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm|archivedate=13 July 2005}} (see [[work of the United States Government|here]] regarding copyright)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, Canada, and the United States electrical engineers make up around 0.25% of the labor force (see [[#demographics|&lt;span id="demographics_back"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;]]).

==Tools and work==

From the [[Global Positioning System]] to [[electricity generation|electric power generation]], electrical engineers have contributed to the development of a wide range of technologies. They design, develop, test, and supervise the deployment of electrical systems and electronic devices. For example, they may work on the design of [[telecommunication|telecommunication systems]], the operation of [[power station|electric power stations]], the [[lighting]] and [[electrical wiring|wiring]] of [[building]]s, the design of [[home appliance|household appliances]], or the electrical [[control theory|control]] of industrial machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronics Engineers, except Computer |work=Occupational Outlook Handbook |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm |accessdate=16 July 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050713014728/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm |archivedate=13 July 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }} (see )&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Molnya-1 Musee du Bourget P1010442.jpg|thumb|left|[[Communications satellite|Satellite communications]] is typical of what electrical engineers work on.]]
Fundamental to the discipline are the sciences of [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] as these help to obtain both a [[Qualitative data|qualitative]] and [[Quantity|quantitative]] description of how such systems will work. Today most [[engineering]] work involves the use of [[computers]] and it is commonplace to use [[computer-aided design]] programs when designing electrical systems. Nevertheless, the ability to sketch ideas is still invaluable for quickly communicating with others.

[[File:Shadow Hand Bulb large.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Shadow Hand|Shadow robot hand]] system]]
Although most electrical engineers will understand basic [[circuit theory]] (that is the interactions of elements such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s, and [[inductor]]s in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, [[quantum mechanics]] and [[solid state physics]] might be relevant to an engineer working on [[VLSI]] (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even [[circuit theory]] may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunication systems that use [[commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for electrical engineers are reflected in university programs, which emphasize [[numeracy|strong numerical skills]], [[computer literacy]], and the ability to understand the [[technical terminology|technical language and concepts]] that relate to electrical engineering.{{Sfn|Taylor|2008|p=241}}

[[File:Laser in fibre.jpg|thumb|A [[laser]] bouncing down an [[poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] rod, illustrating the total internal reflection of light in a multi-mode optical fiber.]]

A wide range of instrumentation is used by electrical engineers.  For simple control circuits and alarms, a basic [[multimeter]] measuring [[voltage]], [[electric current|current]], and [[electrical resistance|resistance]] may suffice.  Where time-varying signals need to be studied, the [[oscilloscope]] is also an ubiquitous instrument.  In [[RF engineering]] and high frequency telecommunications, [[spectrum analyzer]]s and [[Network analyzer (electrical)|network analyzer]]s are used.  In some disciplines, safety can be a particular concern with instrumentation.  For instance, medical electronics designers must take into account that much lower voltages than normal can be dangerous when electrodes are directly in contact with internal body fluids.{{sfn|Leitgeb|2010|p=122}} Power transmission engineering also has great safety concerns due to the high voltages used; although [[voltmeter]]s may in principle be similar to their low voltage equivalents, safety and calibration issues make them very different.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naidu|Kamaraju|2009|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many disciplines of electrical engineering use tests specific to their discipline.  Audio electronics engineers use [[audio system measurements|audio test sets]] consisting of a signal generator and a meter, principally to measure level but also other parameters such as [[harmonic distortion]] and [[noise (electronics)|noise]].  Likewise, information technology have their own test sets, often specific to a particular data format, and the same is true of television broadcasting.

For many engineers, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do. A lot of time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing [[budget]]s and determining [[schedule (project management)|project schedules]].&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, James; (2005).

(seminar with [http://www.mech.uwa.edu.au/jpt/Engineering%20Roles%20050503.pdf slides])&lt;/ref&gt; Many senior engineers manage a team of [[technician]]s or other engineers and for this reason [[project management]] skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and [[technical writing|strong written communication]] skills are therefore very important.

The [[Office|workplaces]] of engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do. Electrical engineers may be found in the pristine lab environment of a [[fabrication plant]], onboard a [[Naval ship]], the offices of a [[consulting firm]] or on site at a [[mining|mine]]. During their working life, electrical engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including [[scientist]]s, [[electrician]]s, [[computer programmers]], and other engineers.{{Sfn|McDavid|Echaore-McDavid|2009|p=87}}

Electrical engineering has an intimate relationship with the physical sciences.  For instance, the physicist [[Lord Kelvin]] played a major role in the engineering of the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]].&lt;ref&gt;Huurdeman, pp.&amp;nbsp;95–96&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, the engineer [[Oliver Heaviside]] produced major work on the mathematics of transmission on telegraph cables.&lt;ref&gt;Huurdeman, p.90&lt;/ref&gt;  Electrical engineers are often required on major science projects.  For instance, large [[particle accelerator]]s such as [[CERN]] need electrical engineers to deal with many aspects of the project: from the power distribution, to the instrumentation, to the manufacture and installation of the [[superconducting electromagnet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, p.218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martini, p.179&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extraordinary optical transmission''' ('''EOT''') is the phenomenon of greatly enhanced transmission of light through a [[subwavelength]] aperture in an otherwise opaque metallic film which has been patterned with a regularly repeating periodic structure.  Generally when [[light]] of a certain [[wavelength]] falls on a subwavelength aperture, it is [[diffraction|diffracted]] [[Isotropy|isotropically]] in all directions evenly, with minimal [[far-field]] transmission.  This is the understanding from classical aperture theory as described by [[Hans Bethe|Bethe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bethe | first1 = H. | title = Theory of Diffraction by Small Holes | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.66.163 | journal = Physical Review | volume = 66 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 163–182| year = 1944 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1944PhRv...66..163B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In EOT however, the regularly repeating structure enables much higher transmission efficiency to occur, up to several orders of magnitude greater than that predicted by classical aperture theory. It was first described in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=T. W. Ebbesen |author2=H. J. Lezec |author3=H. F. Ghaemi |author4=T. Thio |author5=P. A.

This phenomenon that was fully analyzed with a microscopic scattering model is ''partly'' attributed to the presence of [[surface plasmon]] resonances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=H. Liu |author2=P. Lalanne |title=Microscopic theory of the extraordinary optical transmission |journal=Nature|volume=452|pages=728–731|year=2008|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v452/n7188/abs/nature06762.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[constructive interference]]. A surface plasmon (SP) is a collective excitation of the [[electron]]s at the junction between a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] and an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] and is one of a series of interactions between light and a metal surface called [[Plasmonics]].

Currently, there is experimental evidence of EOT out of the optical range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=M. Beruete |author2=M. Sorolla |author3=I. Campillo |author4=J.S. Dolado |author5=L.

Simple analytical explanations of this phenomenon have been elaborated, emphasizing the similarity between arrays of particles and arrays of holes, and establishing that the phenomenon is dominated by [[diffraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F.

==Applications==
EOT is expected to play an important role in the creation of components of 'photonic' circuits. (Photonic circuits are analogous to electronic circuits.)

One of the most ground-breaking results linked to EOT is the possibility to implement a Left-Handed [[Metamaterial]] (LHM) by simply stacking hole arrays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=M. Beruete |author2=M. Sorolla |author3=I.

This can be exploited as a means of transducing chemical binding events by measuring a change in the local [[dielectric constant]] (due to binding of the target species) as a shift in the spectral location of the EOT peak. EOT offers one key advantage over a Kretschmann-style SPR chemical sensor, that of being an inherently nanometer-micrometer scale device; it is therefore particularly amenable to miniaturization.

The '''fin whale''' (''Balaenoptera physalus''), also known as '''finback whale''' or '''common rorqual''' and formerly known as '''herring whale''' or '''razorback whale''', is a marine mammal belonging to the [[Order (biology)#Zoology|parvorder]] of [[baleen whale]]s.

[[United States|American]] [[naturalist]] [[Roy Chapman Andrews]] called the fin whale "the greyhound of the sea ... for its beautiful, slender body is built like a racing yacht and the animal can surpass the speed of the fastest ocean steamship."&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Roy Chapman. (1916). ''Whale hunting with gun and camera; a naturalist's account of the modern shore-whaling industry, of whales and their habits, and of hunting experiences in various parts of the world''. New York: D. Appleton and Co., p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fin whale's body is long and slender, coloured brownish-grey with a paler underside. The fin whale is a large baleen whale that belongs to the [[Cetacea]]n order, which includes all species of whale, dolphin, and porpoise. At least two recognized subspecies exist, in the North Atlantic and the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. It is found in all the major oceans, from [[polar region|polar]] to [[tropics|tropical]] waters. It is absent only from waters close to the [[ice packs|ice pack]] at the poles and relatively small areas of water away from the open ocean. The highest population density occurs in [[temperateness|temperate]] and cool waters.&lt;ref name="nmfs1"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Marine Fisheries Service | year = 2006 | title=Draft recovery plan for the fin whale (''Balaenoptera physalus'')| publisher = National Marine Fisheries Service | location = Silver Spring, Maryland | url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/recovery/draft_finwhale.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its food consists of small [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling]] fish, [[squid]], and [[crustacean]]s including [[copepod]]s and [[krill]].

Like all other large whales, the fin whale was heavily [[whaling|hunted]] during the 20th century. As a result, it is an [[endangered species]]. Over 725,000 fin whales were reportedly taken from the Southern Hemisphere between 1905 and 1976; as of 1997 only 38,000 survived.&lt;ref name="iucn" /&gt; Recovery of the overall population size of [[southern fin whale|southern species]] is predicted to be at less than 50% of its pre-whaling state by 2100 due to heavier impacts of whaling and slower recovery rates.&lt;ref&gt;[[CSIRO]]. 2017. [https://phys.org/news/2017-08-post-whaling-recovery-southern-hemisphere.html Post-whaling recovery of Southern Hemisphere]. [[Phys.org]]. Retrieved on August 22, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The fin whale was first described by [[Friderich Martens]] in 1675 and then again by [[Paul Dudley (jurist)|Paul Dudley]] in 1725. The former description was used as the primary basis of the species ''Balaena physalus'' by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758.&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1804, [[Bernard Germain de Lacépède]] reclassified the species as ''Balaenoptera rorqual'', based on a specimen that had stranded on [[Île Sainte-Marguerite]] ([[Cannes]], France) in 1798. In 1830, [[Louis Companyo]] described a specimen that had stranded near Saint-Cyprien, southern [[France]], in 1828 as ''Balaena musculus''. Most later authors followed him in using the specific name ''musculus'', until [[Frederick W. True]] (1898) showed that it referred to the blue whale. In 1846, [[United Kingdom|British]] taxonomist [[John Edward Gray]] described a {{convert|16.7|m|abbr=on}} specimen from the [[Falkland Islands]] as ''Balaenoptera australis''. In 1865, [[Germany|German]] naturalist [[Hermann Burmeister]] described a roughly {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}} specimen found near [[Buenos Aires]] about 30 years earlier as ''Balaenoptera patachonicus''. In 1903, [[Romania]]n scientist [[Emil Racoviță]] placed all these designations into ''Balaenoptera physalus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=G.

Fin whales are [[rorqual]]s, members of the family [[rorqual#Taxonomy|Balaenopteridae]], which also includes the [[humpback whale]], the [[blue whale]], [[Bryde's whale]], the [[sei whale]], and the [[minke whale]]s. The family diverged from the other [[baleen whale]]s in the suborder [[baleen whale|Mysticeti]] as long ago as the middle [[Miocene]],&lt;ref name="evolution"&gt;{{cite book |isbn = 978-0-07-142784-5 | title = McGraw-Hill Yearbook of Science &amp; Technology | year = 2004 | publisher = The McGraw Hill Companies | chapter = Whale Evolution | author = Gingerich, P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not known when the members of these families further evolved into their own species.

Recent DNA evidence indicates the fin whale may be more closely related to the humpback whale (''Megaptera novaeangliae'') and in at least one study the [[gray whale]] (''Eschrichtius robustus''), two whales in different genera, than it is to members of its own genus, such as the minke whales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cetacean mitochondrial DNA control region: sequences of all extant baleen whales and two sperm whale species|author1=Arnason, U. |author2=Gullberg A. |author3= Widegren, B. |last-author-amp=yes |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|volume=10|pages=960–970|date=1 September 1993|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/5/960|accessdate=25 January 2009|pmid=8412655|issue=5|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mitochondrial Phylogenetics and Evolution of Mysticete Whales|author=Sasaki, T.|journal=Systematic Biology|volume=54|issue=1|pages=77–90|date=23 February 2005|doi=10.1080/10635150590905939|url=http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/1/77.full|accessdate=25 January 2009|pmid=15805012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phylogenetic relationships among the baleen whales based on maternally and paternally inherited characters|author=Hatch, L.T.|author2=Dopman, E.B.|author3=Harrison, R.G.|last-author-amp=yes|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=41|pages=12–27|date=26 May 2006|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.05.023|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/biology/labs/dopman/documents/pub2006PhylogeneticRelationships.pdf|issue=1|pmid=16843014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Radiation of Extant Cetaceans Driven by Restructuring of the Ocean|author=Seeman, Mette E., et al|journal=Systematic Biology|date=December 2009|volume=58|issue=6|pages=573–585|jstor=25677547|doi=10.1093/sysbio/syp060|pmid=20525610|pmc=2777972}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- If further research confirms this theory, the [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] would need revision. --&gt;
As of 2006, two [[subspecies]] are named, each with distinct physical features and vocalizations.

The three groups mix at most rarely.&lt;ref name=Archer2013&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Archer | first1 = FI | last2 = Morin | first2 = PA | last3 = Hancock-Hanser | first3 = BL | last4 = Robertson | first4 = KM | last5 = Leslie | first5 = MS | year = 2013 | title = Mitogenomic Phylogenetics of Fin Whales (Balaenoptera physalus spp.): Genetic Evidence for Revision of Subspecies | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 5| page = e63396 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0063396 |display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...863396A | pmid=23691042 | pmc=3656932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke (2004) proposed a "pygmy" subspecies (''B. p. patachonica'', Burmeister, 1865) that is purportedly darker in colour and has black baleen. He based this on a single physically mature {{convert|19.8|m|abbr=on}} female caught in the Antarctic in 1947–48, the smaller average size (a few feet) of sexually and physically mature fin whales caught by the Japanese around [[50 parallel south|50°S]], and smaller, darker sexually immature fin whales caught in the Antarctic which he believed were a "migratory phase" of his proposed subspecies. His proposal is not widely accepted and no genetic evidence for their existence is available.&lt;ref name="iucn" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarke2004&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Clarke | first1 = R. | year = 2004 | title = Pygmy fin whales | url = | journal = Marine Mammal Science | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 329–334 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.2004.tb01161.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fin whale is usually distinguished by its tall spout, long back, prominent [[dorsal fin]], and asymmetrical colouration.

The animal's large size aids in identification, and it is usually only confused with the [[blue whale]], the [[sei whale]], or, in warmer waters, [[Bryde's whale]].

=== Size ===
In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the average size of adult males and females is about {{convert|18.5|and|20|m}}, respectively, averaging 38.5 and 50.5 tonnes (42.5 and 55.5 tons),&lt;ref name="Lockyer1976" /&gt; while in the Southern Hemisphere, it is {{cvt|20.5|and|22|m}},&lt;ref name="evans1987"&gt;Evans, Peter G.

=== Colouration and markings ===

The fin whale is brownish to dark or light gray dorsally and white ventrally. The left side of the head is dark gray, while the right side exhibits a complex pattern of contrasting light and dark markings. On the right lower jaw is a white or light gray "right mandible patch", which sometimes extends out as a light "blaze" laterally and dorsally unto the upper jaw and back to just behind the blowholes. Two narrow dark stripes originate from the eye and ear, the former widening into a large dark area on the shoulder—these are separated by a light area called the "interstripe wash". These markings are more prominent on individuals in the North Atlantic than in the North Pacific, where they can appear indistinct. The left side exhibits similar but much fainter markings. Dark, oval-shaped areas of pigment called "flipper shadows" extend below and posterior to the pectoral fins. This type of [[asymmetry]] is seen in [[Omura's whale]] and occasionally in [[minke whale]]s. It was thought to have evolved because the whale swims on its right side when surface lunging and it sometimes circles to the right while at the surface above a prey patch. However, the whales just as often circle to the left. No accepted hypothesis explains the asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Tershy, B. R.|author2=D. Wiley|title=Asymmetrical pigmentation in the fin whale: a test of two feeding related hypotheses|year=1992|journal=Marine Mammal Science |volume=8 |issue=3|pages=315–318|doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.1992.tb00416.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has paired [[Blowhole (biology)|blowholes]] on a prominent splashguard and a broad, flat, V-shaped [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]]. A single median ridge stops well short of the rostrum tip. A light V-shaped marking, the [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]], begins behind the blowholes and extends back and then forward again.
The whale has a series of 56–100 [[pleat]]s or grooves along the bottom of the body that run from the tip of the [[chin]] to the [[navel]] that allow the throat area to expand greatly during feeding. It has a curved, prominent [[dorsal fin]] that ranges in height from {{convert|26|-|75|cm|in|abbr=on}} (usually {{convert|45|-|60|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) and averages about {{convert|51|cm|abbr=on}}, lying about three quarters of the way along the back.&lt;ref name="MacWheel1929" /&gt; Its [[Flipper (anatomy)|flippers]] are small and tapered and its tail is wide, pointed at the tip, and notched in the centre.&lt;ref name=Shirihai /&gt;

When the whale surfaces, the dorsal fin is visible soon after the spout. The spout is vertical and narrow and can reach heights of {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}} or more.&lt;ref name=Shirihai /&gt;

=== Nervous system ===
The oral cavity of the fin whale has a very stretchy or extensible nerve system which aids them in feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.03.007 |title=Stretchy nerves are an essential component of the extreme feeding mechanism of rorqual whales | pmid=25942546 |volume=25 |issue=9 |year=2015 |journal=Curr.

== Life history ==

[[Mating]] occurs in temperate, low-latitude seas during the winter, followed by an 11- to 12-month [[gestation period]]. A newborn [[weaning|weans]] from its mother at 6 or 7 months of age when it is {{convert|11|to|12|m|abbr=on}} in length, and the {{linktext|calf}} accompanies the mother to the summer feeding ground. Females reproduce every 2 or 3 years, with as many as six [[fetus]]es being reported, but single births are far more common. Females reach sexual maturity between 6 and 12 years of age at lengths of {{convert|17.7|–|19|m|abbr=on}} in the Northern Hemisphere and {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}} in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref name="evans1987" /&gt; Calves remain with their mothers for about one year.&lt;ref name=clapham /&gt;

Full physical [[sexual maturity|maturity]] is attained between 25 and 30 years. Fin whales have a maximum life span of at least 94 years of age,&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;{{cite book | last=Martin | first=Anthony R. | title=Whales and dolphins |publisher=Salamander Books | location=London | year=1991 | isbn=978-0-8160-3922-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; although specimens have been found aged at an estimated 135–140 years.&lt;ref name="dr"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ditte Haue |url=http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2010/10/28/141517.htm |title=Finhvalen var mindst 135 år gammel &amp;#124; Nyheder &amp;#124; DR |publisher=Dr.dk |accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fin whale is one of the fastest [[cetacea]]ns and can sustain speeds between {{convert|37|km/h|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="ADW" /&gt; and {{convert|41|km/h|abbr=on}} and bursts up to {{convert|46|km/h|abbr=on}} have been recorded, earning the fin whale the nickname "the [[greyhound]] of the sea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.ca/notebooks/english/finwale.htm |title=Fin Whale
|publisher=nature.ca: Canadian Museum of Nature|accessdate=22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fin whales are more gregarious than other rorquals, and often live in groups of 6–10, although feeding groups may reach up to 100 animals.&lt;ref name="martin" /&gt;

When fin whale sounds were first recorded by US biologists, they did not realize that these unusually loud, long, pure and regular sounds were being made by whales. They first investigated the possibilities that the sounds were due to equipment malfunction, [[geophysics|geophysical]] phenomena, or even part of a [[Soviet Union]] scheme for detecting enemy submarines. Eventually, biologists demonstrated that the sounds were the vocalizations of fin whales.&lt;ref name=Payne /&gt;

Direct association of these vocalizations with the reproductive season for the species and that only males make the sounds point to these vocalizations as possible reproductive displays.&lt;!-- bragging?--&gt;&lt;ref name="croll"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Croll, D.A.|author2=Clark, C.W. |author3=Acevedo, A. |author4=Flores, S. |author5=Gedamke, J. |author6=Urban, J.  |year=2002 |journal=Nature |volume=417 |issue=6891 |title=Only male fin whales sing loud songs|url=http://polymer.bu.edu/hes/articles/aabmsss02.pdf |format=PDF  |page=809|doi=10.1038/417809a|last7=Urban |first7=Jorge |bibcode = 2002Natur.417..809C |pmid=12075339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tyack"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=JASMAN000082000006001901000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=82 |issue=6 |pages=1901–1902 |author=Watkins, W. |author2=Tyack, P. |author3=Moore, K. |author4=Bird, J.  |title=The 20&amp;nbsp;Hz signals of finback whales (Balaenoptera physalus)|doi=10.1121/1.395685|year=1987|bibcode = 1987ASAJ...82.1901W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past 100 years, the dramatic increase in ocean noise from shipping and naval activity may have slowed the recovery of the fin whale population, by impeding communications between males and receptive females.&lt;ref name="cornell02"&gt;{{cite web | title = Humanity's din in the oceans could be blocking whales' courtship songs and population recovery | url =http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/June02/ocean_noise.hrs.html | date = 19 June 2002 | author = Segelken, R.|accessdate = 11 November 2006 | publisher = Cornell University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When feeding, they blow 5–7 times in quick succession, but while traveling or resting will blow once every minute or two. On their terminal (last) dive they arch their back high out of the water, but rarely raise their [[Whale#Appendages|flukes]] out of the water. They then dive to depths of up to {{convert|470|m|abbr=on}} when feeding or a few hundred feet when resting or traveling. The average feeding dive off California and Baja lasts 6 minutes, with a maximum of 17 minutes; when traveling or resting they usually dive for only a few minutes at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Croll|first1=D.

Like many large rorquals, the fin whale is a [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan species]]. It is found in all the world's major oceans and in waters ranging from the [[Polar region|polar]] to the tropical. It is absent only from waters close to the [[ice pack]] at both the north and south extremities and relatively small areas of water away from the large oceans, such as the [[Red Sea]] although they can reach into the [[Baltic Sea]], a [[marginal sea]] of such conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cetacea.de/news/archiv/2005/10/arch051001.shtml|title=Wieder Finnwal in der Ostsee|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415090735/http://www.cetacea.de/news/archiv/2005/10/arch051001.shtml|archivedate=15 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ostsee-zeitung.de/Region-Rostock/Rostock/Finnwal-in-der-Ostsee-gesichtet|title=Rostock/Eckernförde – Finnwal in der Ostsee gesichtet – OZ – Ostsee-Zeitung|first=Ostsee-Zeitung GmbH &amp; Co.|last=KG|website=www.ostsee-zeitung.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/panorama/Angler-filmt-Wal-in-Ostsee-Bucht-id34821572.html|title=Angler filmt Wal in Ostsee-Bucht|first=Augsburger|last=Allgemeine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jansson N.. 2007.

The North Atlantic fin whale has an extensive distribution, occurring from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[Mediterranean Sea]], northward to [[Baffin Bay]] and [[Spitsbergen]]. In general, fin whales are more common north of approximately [[30th parallel north|30°N latitude]], but considerable confusion arises about their occurrence south of 30°N latitude because of the difficulty in distinguishing fin whales from [[Bryde's whale]]s.&lt;ref name="mead"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Mead, J.G. | year = 1977 | journal = Rep.

Although fin whales are certainly migratory, moving [[season]]ally in and out of high-latitude feeding areas, the overall migration pattern is not well understood. [[Acoustics|Acoustic]] readings from passive-listening [[hydrophone]] arrays indicate a southward migration of the North Atlantic fin whale occurs in the autumn from the [[Labrador]]-[[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] region, south past [[Bermuda]], and into the [[Caribbean|West Indies]].&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Clark, C.W. | year = 1995 | title = Application of US Navy underwater hydrophone arrays for scientific research on whales | journal = Rep.

In the Pacific, migration patterns are poorly characterized.

North Atlantic fin whales are defined by the [[International Whaling Commission]] to exist in one of seven discrete population zones: [[Nova Scotia]]-[[New England]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]-[[Labrador]], western [[Greenland]], eastern Greenland-[[Iceland]], North [[Norway]], West Norway-[[Faroe Islands]], and [[Ireland]]-[[Spain]]-[[United Kingdom]]-[[Portugal]]. Results of mark-and-recapture surveys have indicated that some movement occurs across the boundaries of these zones, suggesting that they are not entirely discrete and that some immigration and emigration does occur.&lt;ref name="mitchell 1974" /&gt; Sigurjónsson estimated in 1995 that total pre-exploitation population size in the entire [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] ranged between 50,000 and 100,000 animals,&lt;ref name="sigurjonsson"&gt;{{cite book | author = Sigurjónsson, J. | year = 1995 | chapter = On the life history and autecology of North Atlantic rorquals | pages = 425–441 |editor1=A.S.

Relatively little is known about the historical and current population levels of the Southern fin whale. The IWC officially estimates that the [[Southern Hemisphere]] pre-whaling population was 400,000 whales and that the population in 1979 (at the cessation of Antarctic large scale whaling) was 85,200.&lt;ref name="IWC79"&gt;{{cite journal | author = IWC | year = 1979 | title = Report of the sub-committee on protected species.

=== Predation ===
The only known predator of the fin whale is the [[killer whale]], with at least 20 eyewitness and second-hand accounts of attack or harassment. They usually flee and offer little resistance to attack. Only a few confirmed fatalities have occurred. In October 2005, 16 killer whales attacked and killed a fin whale in the Canal de Ballenas, Gulf of California, after chasing it for about an hour. They fed on its sinking carcass for about 15 minutes before leaving the area. In June 2012, a pod of killer whales was seen in La Paz Bay, in the Gulf of California, chasing a fin whale for over an hour before finally killing it and feeding on its carcass. The whale bore numerous tooth rakes over its back and dorsal fin; several killer whales flanked it on either side, with one individual visible under water biting at its right lower jaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petethomasoutdoors.com/2013/07/orcas-attack-kill-large-fin-whale-off-la-paz-rare-footage.html|title=Orcas attack, kill large fin whale off La Paz (rare footage) – Pete Thomas Outdoors|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1908, a whaler reportedly saw two killer whales attack and kill a fin whale off western [[Greenland]]. In January 1984, seven were seen from the air circling, holding the flippers, and ramming a fin whale in the Gulf of California, but the observation ended at nightfall.&lt;ref name="Jefferson et al 1991"&gt;{{cite journal

The fin whale is a [[filter-feeder]], feeding on small schooling fish, [[squid]] and [[crustacean]]s including [[copepod]]s and [[krill]].

In the North Pacific, they feed on [[euphausiid]]s in the genera ''[[Euphausia]]'', ''[[Thysanoessa]]'', and ''[[Nyctiphanes]]'', large [[copepod]]s in the genus ''Neocalanus'', small schooling fish (e.g. the genera ''[[Engraulis]]'', ''[[Mallotus (fish)|Mallotus]]'', ''[[Clupea]]'', and ''[[Theragra]]''), and squid. Based on stomach content analysis of over 19,500 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the North Pacific from 1952 to 1971, 64.1% contained only krill, 25.5% copepods, 5.0% fish, 3.4% krill and copepods and 1.7% squid.&lt;ref name="nemotokawamura1977"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nemoto, T. |author2=A.

Whal. Commn |volume = Spec. Iss. 1 |pages =80–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nemoto (1959) analyzed the stomach contents of about 7500 fin whales caught in the northern North Pacific and [[Bering Sea]] from 1952 to 1958, found that they mainly preyed on euphausiids around the [[Aleutian Islands]] and in the [[Gulf of Alaska]] and schooling fish in the northern Bering Sea and off [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]]. In the northern Bering Sea (north of [[58th parallel north|58°N]]), their main prey species were [[capelin]] (''Mallotus villosus''), [[Alaska pollock]] (''Theragra chalcogramma'') and [[Pacific herring]] (''Clupea pallasii''); they also consumed [[saffron cod]] (''Eleginus gracilis''). [[Arctic krill]] (''Thysanoessa raschii'') was the only species of euphausiid found in the stomachs of fin whales in the northern Bering Sea. Off Kamchatka, they appeared to primarily feed on [[herring]]. They also took large quantities of the copepod ''Neocalanus cristatus'' around the Aleutian Islands and in [[Olyutorsky Gulf|Olyutorsky Bay]] off northeast Kamchatka, areas where the species was abundant. Five species of euphausiid (''[[Euphausia pacifica]]'', ''Thysanoessa spinifera'', ''T. inermis'', ''T. raschii'', and ''T. longipes'') were the predominant prey around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska.

=== Pathology ===
Fin whales suffer from a number of pathological conditions. The parasitic copepod ''[[Pennella balaenopterae]]''—usually found on the flank of fin whales—burrows into their [[blubber]] to feed on their blood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Çíçek, Erdoğan|author2=Öktener, Ahmet|author3=Çapar, Osman Bahadır |title=First Report of ''Pennella balaenopterae'' Koren and Danielssen, 1877 (Copepoda: Pennelidae) from Turkey|journal=Türkiye Parazitoloji Dergisi (Turkish Journal of Parasitology)|volume=31|issue=3|pages=239–241|year=2007|url=http://www.turkiyeparazitolderg.org/sayilar/23/buyuk/pdf_TPD_2851.pdf|pmid=17918069}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[whale barnacle|pseudo-stalked barnacle]] ''Xenobalanus globicipitis'' is generally found more often on the dorsal fin, pectoral fins, and flukes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://fishbull.noaa.gov/901/rajaguru.pdf|title=Association between the sessile barnacle ''Xenobalanus globiclpitis'' (Coronulidae) and the bottlenose dolphin ''Tursiops truncatus'' (Delphinidae) from the Bay of Bengal, India, with a summary of previous records from cetaceans|author=Rajaguru, Arjuna|author2=Shantha, Gopalsamy|journal=Fishery Bulletin|volume=90|pages=197–202|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other barnacles found on fin whales include the [[Sessilia|acorn barnacle]] ''Coronula reginae'' and the [[Goose barnacle|stalked barnacle]] ''[[Conchoderma]] auritum'', which attaches to ''Coronula'' or the baleen. The [[Harpacticoida|harpacticid]] copepod ''Balaenophilus unisetus'' (heavy infestations of which have been found in fin whales caught off northwestern Spain) and the [[ciliate]] ''Haematophagus'' also infest the baleen, the former feeding on the baleen itself and the latter on red blood cells.&lt;ref name="Mac1943" /&gt;

The [[remora]] ''[[Whalesucker|Remora australis]]'' and occasionally the amphipod ''[[Whale louse|Cyamus balaenopterae]]'' can also be found on fin whales, both feeding on the skin. Infestations of the giant [[nematode]] ''Crassicauda boopis'' can cause inflammation of the [[Renal artery|renal arteries]] and potential [[kidney]] failure, while the smaller ''C. crassicauda'' infects the [[Urinary system|lower urinary tract]].&lt;ref name="mizroch" /&gt;

In the 19th century, the fin whale was occasionally hunted by open-boat [[whaling|whalers]], but it was relatively safe, because it could easily outrun ships of the time and often sank when killed, making the pursuit a waste of time for whalers. However, the later introduction of steam-powered boats and [[harpoon]]s that exploded on impact made it possible to kill and secure them along with blue and sei whales on an industrial scale. As other whale species became overhunted, the whaling industry turned to the still-abundant fin whale as a substitute.&lt;ref name="acs"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://acsonline.org/fact-sheets/fin-whale/| title=American Cetacean Society Fact Sheet: Fin Whale, ''Balaenoptera physalus''| publisher=American Cetacean Society| accessdate=12 March 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424175802/http://acsonline.org/fact-sheets/fin-whale/| archivedate=24 April 2013| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was primarily hunted for its blubber, [[whale oil|oil]], and baleen.

The introduction of factory ships with stern slipways in 1925 substantially increased the number of whales taken per year. In 1937–38 alone, over 29,000 fin whales were taken. From 1953–54 to 1961–62, the catch averaged over 30,000 per year. By 1962–63, sei whale catches began to increase as fin whales became scarce. By 1975–76, fewer than 1,000 fin whales were being caught each year. In the North Pacific, over 74,000 fin whales were caught between 1910 and 1975.&lt;ref name="barlow97"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barlow, J. | author2 = K. A. Forney | author3 = P.S.

=== Whale watching ===
[[File:Whale watching Tadoussac 11.jpg|left|200px|thumb|People in a [[Zodiac Marine &amp; Pool|zodiac]] watching several Fin whales off [[Tadoussac]]]]

Fin whales are regularly encountered on whale-watching excursions worldwide. In the [[Southern California Bight]], fin whales are encountered year-round, with the best sightings between November and March. They can even be seen from land (for example, from [[Point Vicente Light|Point Vicente]], Palos Verdes, where they can be seen lunge feeding at the surface only a half mile to a few miles offshore). They are regularly sighted in the summer and fall in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bed2.gremm.org/eng/pag.php?PagRef=3-2-11|title=Whales Online – Fin whale|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712140059/http://bed2.gremm.org/eng/pag.php?PagRef=3-2-11|archivedate=12 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gulf of Maine]], the [[Bay of Fundy]], the [[Bay of Biscay]], [[Strait of Gibraltar]], the [[Mediterranean]].

== Conservation ==
[[File:Israeli-Police-Facebook--Whale-001.jpg|thumb|A immature fin whale in distress off national park of [[Caesarea Maritima]]]]
The fin whale is listed on both Appendix I&lt;ref name="Appendices"&gt;"[http://www.cms.int/documents/appendix/Appendices_COP9_E.pdf Appendix I and Appendix II] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611112003/http://www.cms.int/documents/appendix/Appendices_COP9_E.pdf |date=11 June 2011 }}" of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). As amended by the Conference of the Parties in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008. Effective: 5 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and Appendix II&lt;ref name="Appendices" /&gt; of the [[Bonn Convention|Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals]] (CMS). It is listed on Appendix I&lt;ref name="Appendices" /&gt; as this species has been categorized as in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of its range and CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them.

It is listed on Appendix II&lt;ref name="Appendices" /&gt; as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements. In addition, the fin whale is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the [[Black Sea]], Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area ([[ACCOBAMS]]) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region ([[Pacific Islands Cetaceans Memorandum of Understanding|Pacific Cetaceans MOU]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accobams.org/|title=Accobams News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2143">The '''Geiger Tube Telescope''' is a scientific instrument that measures the intensities, energy spectra, and angular distribution of energetic [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s in interplanetary space and near [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]].

On [[Pioneer 10]], the instrument used an array of seven miniature [[Geiger-Müller tube]]s, collectively known as a Geiger Tube Telescope (GTT). Each tube was a small gas-filled cylinder. When a charged particle passed through the gas, an electrical pulse was generated by the applied voltage. Individual pulses from five of the tubes and coincident pulses from three combinations of the seven tubes were transmitted. Protons of energy greater than 5 [[Electronvolt|MeV]] and electrons with energies greater 40 keV were detected. 

On [[Pioneer 11]], one Geiger-Müller tube was replaced by a thin [[silicon wafer]] to detect protons in the specific energy range 0.61 to 3.41 MeV. Other minor changes were made to improve the characteristics of the detector system. 

The trains of pulses were passed through quasi-logarithmic data processors and then to the radio [[telemetry]] system of the spacecraft. Angular distributions were measured as the spacecraft rotated.   This telemetry data was transmitted to the earth by an 8 watt [[S band]] [[transmitter]] within the Pioneer probe at one of eight data rates (from 16 to 2048 bits per second).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11250">'''Grazing-incidence small-angle scattering''' ('''GISAS''') is a scattering technique used to study nanostructured surfaces and thin films. The scattered probe is either photons ('''grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering''', '''GISAXS''') or neutrons ('''grazing-incidence small-angle neutron scattering''', '''GISANS'''). GISAS combines the accessible length scales of [[small-angle scattering]] (SAS: [[SAXS]] or [[Small-angle neutron scattering|SANS]]) and the surface sensitivity of [[grazing incidence diffraction]] (GID).

[[Image:GISAXS.png|300px|thumb|right|Geometry of a GISAS experiment. The incident beam strikes the sample under a small angle close to the critical angle of total external x-ray reflection. The intense reflected beam as well as the intense scattering in the incident plane are attenuated by a rod-shaped beam stop. The diffuse scattering from the sample (red arrow) is recorded with an area detector. As an example the scattering from a block copolymer film with perpendicular lamellae is shown in the detector plane. The two lobes of scattering correspond to the lateral lamellar period of about 80&amp;nbsp;nm.

==Applications==

A typical application of GISAS is the characterisation of [[self-assembly]] and [[self-organization]] on the [[nanoscale]] in thin films. Systems studied by GISAS include quantum dot arrays,&lt;ref&gt;T. H. Metzger, I. Kegel, R. Paniago, A. Lorke, J. Peisl, J. Schulze, I. Eisele, P. Schittenhelm, and G.

GISAXS was introduced by Levine and Cohen&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Levine, J. B. Cohen, Y. W. Chung and P. Georgopoulos:" Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering: new tool for studying thin film growth", J. Appl. Cryst. 22, 528-532 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; to study the dewetting of gold deposited on a glass surface. The technique was further developed by Naudon&lt;ref&gt;A. Naudon in H. Brumberger (ed.): "Modern Aspects of Small-Angle Scattering", (Kluwer Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, 1995), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; and coworkers to study metal agglomerates on surfaces and in buried interfaces.&lt;ref name=Hazra1&gt;S. Hazra, A. Gibaud, A. Desert, C. Sella, and A. Naudon: "Morphology of nanocermet thin films: x-ray scattering study", Physica B 283, 97 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of [[nanoscience]] other applications evolved quickly, first in hard matter such as the characterization of [[quantum dots]] on semiconductor surfaces and the in-situ characterization of metal deposits on oxide surfaces. This was soon to be followed by [[soft matter]] systems such as ultrathin [[polymer]] films,&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Gutmann, P. Müller-Buschbaum, D. W. Schubert, N. Stribeck, D. Smilgies, and M. Stamm: "Roughness Correlations in Ultrathin Polymer Blend Films" (Proceedings of SXNS–6), Physica B 283, 40 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; polymer blends, [[block copolymer]] films and other self-organized nanostructured thin films that have become indispensable for nanoscience and technology. Future challenges of GISAS may lie in biological applications, such as [[proteins]], [[peptides]], or [[viruses]] attached to surfaces or in lipid layers.

==Interpretation==

As a hybrid technique, GISAS combines concepts from transmission small-angle scattering (SAS), from grazing-incidence diffraction (GID), and from diffuse reflectometry. From SAS it uses the form factors and structure factors. From GID it uses the scattering geometry close to the critical angles of substrate and film, and the two-dimensional character of the scattering, giving rise to diffuse rods of scattering intensity perpendicular to the surface. With diffuse (off-specular) reflectometry it shares phenomena like the Yoneda/Vinyard peak at the critical angle of the sample, and the scattering theory, the [[distorted wave Born approximation]] (DWBA).&lt;ref&gt;S. K. Sinha, E. B. Sirota, S. Garoff, and H. B. Stanley: "X-ray and neutron scattering from rough surfaces", Phys. Rev. B 38, 2297-2311 (1988); M. Rauscher, T. Salditt, and H. Spohn: "Small-angle X-ray scattering under grazing incidence: the cross section in the distorted-wave Born approximation", Phys. Rev. B, 52(23), 16855-16863, (1995); R. Lazzari: "IsGISAXS: a program for grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering analysis of supported islands", J. Appl. Cryst. 35, 406-421 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; However, while diffuse reflectivity remains confined to the incident plane (the plane given by the incident beam and the surface normal), GISAS explores the whole scattering from the surface in all directions, typically utilizing an area detector. Thus GISAS gains access to a wider range of lateral and vertical structures and, in particular, is sensitive to the morphology and [[preferential alignment]] of nanoscale objects at the surface or inside the thin film.

As a particular consequence of the DWBA, the refraction of x-rays or neutrons has to be always taken into account in the case of thin film studies,&lt;ref&gt;Byeongdu Lee, Insun Park, Jinhwan Yoon, Soojin Park, Jehan Kim, Kwang-Woo Kim, Taihyun Chang, and Moonhor Ree: "Structural Analysis of Block Copolymer Thin Films with Grazing Incidence Small-Angle X-ray Scattering", Macromolecules 38, 4311-4323(2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="busch"&gt;P. Busch, M. Rauscher, D.-M. Smilgies, D. Posselt, and C. M. Papadakis: "Grazing-incidence small-angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS) as a tool for the investigation of thin nanostructured block copolymer films - The scattering cross-section in the distorted wave Born approximation", J. Appl. Cryst. 39, 433-442 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; due to the fact that scattering angles are small, often less than 1 deg. The refraction correction applies to the perpendicular component of the scattering vector with respect to the substrate while the parallel component is unaffected. Thus parallel scattering can often be interpreted within the kinematic theory of SAS, while refractive corrections apply to the scattering along perpendicular cuts of the scattering image, for instance along a scattering rod.

In the interpretation of GISAS images some complication arises in the scattering from low-Z films e.g. organic materials on silicon wafers, when the incident angle is in between the critical angles of the film and the substrate. In this case, the reflected beam from the substrate has a similar strength as the incident beam and thus the scattering from the reflected beam from the film structure can give rise to a doubling of scattering features in the perpendicular direction. This as well as interference between the scattering from the direct and the reflected beam can be fully accounted for by the DWBA scattering theory.&lt;ref name="busch"/&gt;

These complications are often more than offset by the fact that the dynamic enhancement of the scattering intensity is significant.  In combination with the straightforward scattering geometry, where all relevant information is contained in a single scattering image, in-situ and real-time experiments are facilitated. Specifically self-organization during MBE growth&lt;ref name="renaud"/&gt; and re-organization processes in block copolymer films under the influence of solvent vapor&lt;ref name="smilgies"/&gt; have been characterized on the relevant timescales ranging from seconds to minutes. Ultimately the time resolution is limited by the x-ray flux on the samples necessary to collect an image and the read-out time of the area detector.

==Experimental practice==

Dedicated or partially dedicated GISAXS beamlines exist at many [[synchrotron light sources]] (for instance [[Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource|SSRL]], [[Advanced Photon Source|APS]], [[Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-based Sciences and Education#CHESS|CHESS]], [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility|ESRF]], [[DESY#HASYLAB|HASYLAB]], [[National Synchrotron Light Source|NSLS]], Pohang Light Source) and also Advanced Light Source at LBNL.

At [[neutron research facility|neutron research facilities]],
GISANS is increasingly used,
typically on small-angle (SANS) instruments or on [[neutron reflectometer|reflectometers]].

GISAS does not require any specific sample preparation other than thin film deposition techniques. Film thicknesses may range from a few nm to several 100&amp;nbsp;nm, and such thin films are still fully penetrated by the x-ray beam. The film surface, the film interior, as well as the substrate-film interface are all accessible. By varying the incidence angle the various contributions can be identified.

'''Image file formats''' are standardized means of organizing and storing [[digital image]]s. Image [[Computer file|files]] are composed of digital data in one of these formats that can be [[Raster graphics|rasterized]] for use on a computer display or printer.  An image file format may store data in uncompressed, compressed, or [[vector graphics|vector]] formats.  Once rasterized, an image becomes a grid of pixels, each of which has a number of bits to designate its color equal to the color depth of the device displaying it.

== Image file sizes ==
The size of raster image files is positively correlated with the number of pixels in the image and the color depth (bits per pixel).  Images can be compressed in various ways, however.  A compression [[algorithm]] stores either an exact representation or an approximation of the original image in a smaller number of bytes that can be expanded back to its uncompressed form with a corresponding decompression algorithm.  Images with the same number of pixels and color depth can have very different compressed file size.  Considering exactly the same compression, number of pixels, and color depth for two images, different graphical complexity of the original images may also result in very different file sizes after compression due to the nature of compression algorithms.  With some compression formats, images that are less complex may result in smaller compressed file sizes.  This characteristic sometimes results in a smaller file size for some lossless formats than lossy formats.  For example, graphically simple images (i.e. images with large continuous regions like line art or animation sequences) may be losslessly compressed into a GIF or PNG format and result in a smaller file size than a lossy JPEG format.

For example, a 640 * 480 pixel image with 24-bit color would occupy almost a megabyte of space:

640 * 480 * 24	= 7,372,800 bits&amp;nbsp; = 921,600 bytes = 900 kB

With vector images the file size increases only with the addition of more vectors.

== Image file compression ==
There are two types of '''image file compression''' algorithms: [[Lossless data compression|lossless]] and [[Lossy compression|lossy]].

'''Lossless compression''' algorithms reduce file size while preserving a perfect copy of the original uncompressed image.  Lossless compression generally, but not always, results in larger files than lossy compression.  Lossless compression should be used to avoid accumulating stages of re-compression when editing images.

'''Lossy compression''' algorithms preserve a representation of the original uncompressed image that may appear to be a perfect copy, but it is not a perfect copy.  Often lossy compression is able to achieve smaller file sizes than lossless compression.  Most lossy compression algorithms allow for variable compression that trades image quality for file size.

== Major graphic file formats ==
{{See also|Comparison of graphics file formats#Technical details}}
Including proprietary types, there are hundreds of image file types. The PNG, JPEG, and GIF formats are most often used to display images on the Internet. Some of these graphic formats are listed and briefly described below, separated into the two main families of graphics: raster and vector.

In addition to straight image formats, '''[[Metafile]]''' formats are portable formats which can include both raster and vector information. Examples are application-independent formats such as [[Windows Metafile|WMF]] and [[Enhanced Metafile|EMF]]. The metafile format is an intermediate format. Most applications open metafiles and then save them in their own native format. '''[[Page description language]]''' refers to formats used to describe the layout of a printed page containing text, objects and images. Examples are [[PostScript]], [[PDF]] and [[Printer Command Language|PCL]].

=== Raster formats ===
{{further|Raster graphics}}

==== JPEG/JFIF ====
[[JPEG]] (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a [[lossy compression]] method; JPEG-compressed images are usually stored in the '''[[JFIF]]''' (JPEG File Interchange Format) file format. The JPEG/JFIF [[filename extension]] is '''JPG''' or '''JPEG'''. Nearly every digital camera can save images in the JPEG/JFIF format, which supports eight-bit grayscale images and 24-bit color images (eight bits each for red, green, and blue).  JPEG applies lossy compression to images, which can result in a significant reduction of the file size.  Applications can determine the degree of compression to apply, and the amount of compression affects the visual quality of the result.  When not too great, the compression does not noticeably affect or detract from the image's quality, but JPEG files suffer [[Generation loss|generational degradation]] when repeatedly edited and saved. (JPEG also provides lossless image storage, but the lossless version is not widely supported.)

==== JPEG 2000 ====
[[JPEG 2000]] is a compression standard enabling both lossless and lossy storage. The compression methods used are different from the ones in standard JFIF/JPEG; they improve quality and compression ratios, but also require more computational power to process. JPEG 2000 also adds features that are missing in JPEG. It is not nearly as common as JPEG, but it is used currently in professional movie editing and distribution (some digital cinemas, for example, use JPEG 2000 for individual movie frames).

====Exif====
The '''Exif''' ([[Exchangeable image file format]]) format is a file standard similar to the JFIF format with TIFF extensions; it is incorporated in the JPEG-writing software used in most cameras. Its purpose is to record and to standardize the exchange of images with [[image metadata]] between digital cameras and editing and viewing software. The metadata are recorded for individual images and include such things as camera settings, time and date, shutter speed, exposure, image size, compression, name of camera, color information. When images are viewed or edited by image editing software, all of this image information can be displayed.

The actual Exif metadata as such may be carried within different host formats, e.g. TIFF, JFIF (JPEG) or PNG. IFF-META is another example.

====TIFF====
The '''TIFF''' ([[Tagged Image File Format]]) format is a flexible format that normally saves eight bits or sixteen bits per color (red, green, blue) for 24-bit and 48-bit totals, respectively, usually using either the '''TIFF''' or '''TIF''' filename extension. The tagged structure was designed to be easily extendible, and many vendors have introduced proprietary special-purpose tags – with the result that no one reader handles every flavor of TIFF file.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}  TIFFs can be lossy or lossless, depending on the technique chosen for storing the pixel data.  Some offer relatively good lossless compression for [[bi-level image|bi-level (black&amp;white) images]]. Some digital cameras can save images in TIFF format, using the [[LZW]] compression algorithm for lossless storage. TIFF image format is not widely supported by web browsers. TIFF remains widely accepted as a photograph file standard in the printing business. TIFF can handle device-specific color spaces, such as the [[CMYK]] defined by a particular set of printing press inks. [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] (Optical Character Recognition) software packages commonly generate some form of TIFF image (often [[Monochrome|monochromatic]]) for scanned text pages.

==== GIF ====
'''GIF''' ([[Graphics Interchange Format]]) is in normal use limited to an 8-bit palette, or 256 colors (while 24-bit color depth is technically possible).&lt;ref name=aminet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.aminet.net/docs/misc/GIF24.readme |title=GIF 24 Bit (truecolor) extensions |author=Andreas Kleinert |year=2007 |accessdate=23 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316215949/http://uk.aminet.net/docs/misc/GIF24.readme |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=philhoward&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phil.ipal.org/tc.html |title=True-Color GIF Example |author=Philip Howard |accessdate=23 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222123613/http://phil.ipal.org/tc.html |archivedate=22 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; GIF is most suitable for storing graphics with few colors, such as simple diagrams, shapes, logos, and cartoon style images, as it uses [[Lempel–Ziv–Welch|LZW]] lossless compression, which is more effective when large areas have a single color, and less effective for photographic or [[dither]]ed images. Due to GIF's simplicity and age, it achieved almost universal software support. Due to its animation capabilities, it is still widely used to provide image animation effects, despite its low compression ratio compared to modern video formats.

==== BMP ====
The '''[[BMP file format]]''' (Windows bitmap) handles graphic files within the Microsoft Windows OS. Typically, BMP files are uncompressed, and therefore large and lossless; their advantage is their simple structure and wide acceptance in Windows programs.

==== PNG ====
The '''PNG''' ([[Portable Network Graphics]]) file format was created as a free, open-source alternative to GIF. The PNG file format supports eight-bit paletted images (with optional transparency for all palette colors) and 24-bit truecolor (16 million colors) or 48-bit truecolor with and without alpha channel - while GIF supports only 256 colors and a single transparent color. 

Compared to JPEG, PNG excels when the image has large, uniformly colored areas. Even for photographs – where JPEG is often the choice for final distribution since its compression technique typically yields smaller file sizes – PNG is still well-suited to storing images during the editing process because of its lossless compression.

PNG provides a patent-free replacement for GIF (though GIF is itself now patent-free), and can also replace many common uses of TIFF. Indexed-color, grayscale, and truecolor images are supported, plus an optional alpha channel. The [[Adam7 algorithm|Adam7]] interlacing allows an early preview, even when only a small percentage of the image data has been transmitted. PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color matching on heterogeneous platforms.

PNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications like [[web browser]]s and can be fully streamed with a progressive display option. PNG is robust, providing both full file integrity checking and simple detection of common transmission errors. 

Animated formats derived from PNG are [[Multiple-image Network Graphics|MNG]] and [[APNG]]. The latter is supported by [[Mozilla Firefox]] and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] and is backwards compatible with PNG.

==== PPM, PGM, PBM, and PNM ====
[[Netpbm format]] is a family including the '''portable pixmap''' file format (PPM), the '''portable graymap''' file format (PGM) and the '''portable bitmap''' file format (PBM). These are either pure [[ASCII]] files or raw binary files with an ASCII header that provide very basic functionality and serve as a lowest common denominator for converting pixmap, graymap, or bitmap files between different platforms. Several applications refer to them collectively as PNM (Portable aNy Map).

==== WebP ====
[[WebP]] is a new open image format that uses both lossless and lossy compression. It was designed by Google to reduce image file size to speed up web page loading: its principal purpose is to supersede JPEG as the primary format for photographs on the web. WebP is based on [[VP8]]'s intra-frame coding and uses a container based on [[Resource Interchange File Format|RIFF]].

==== HDR raster formats ====
Most typical raster formats cannot store [[High dynamic range imaging|HDR]] data (32 bit floating point values per pixel component), which is why some relatively old or complex formats are still predominant here, and worth mentioning separately. Newer alternatives are showing up, though. [[RGBE image format|RGBE]] is the format for HDR images originating from [[Radiance (software)|Radiance]] and also supported by Adobe Photoshop. [[JPEG-HDR]] is a file format from Dolby Labs similar to RGBE encoding, standardized as JPEG XT Part 2. 

[[JPEG XT]] Part 7 includes support for encoding floating point HDR images in the base 8-bit JPEG file using enhancement layers encoded with four profiles (A-D); Profile A is based on the RGBE format and Profile B on the XDepth format from Trellis Management.

==== HEIF ====
The [[High Efficiency Image File Format]] (HEIF) is an image container format that was standardized by [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]] on the basis of the [[ISO base media file format]]. While HEIF can be used with any image compression format, the HEIF standard specifies the storage of [[High Efficiency Video Coding|HEVC]] intra-coded images and HEVC-coded image sequences taking advantage of inter-picture prediction.

==== BAT ====
BAT was released into the public domain by C-Cube Microsystems. The "official" file format for JPEG files is SPIFF (Still Picture Interchange File Format), but by the time it was released, BAT had already achieved wide acceptance. SPIFF, which has the ISO designation 10918-3, offers more versatile compression, color management, and metadata capacity than JPEG/BAT, but it has little support. It may be superseded by JPEG 2000/DIG 2000: ISO SC29/WG1, JPEG - Information Links. Digital Imaging Group, "JPEG 2000 and the DIG: The Picture of Compatibility."

==== BPG ====
BPG ([[Better Portable Graphics]]) is a new image format. Its purpose is to replace the JPEG image format when quality or file size is an issue. Its main advantages are:
* High [[compression ratio]]. Files are much smaller than [[JPEG]] for similar quality.
* Supported by most Web browsers with a small [[JavaScript|Javascript]] decoder (gzipped size: 76 KB).
* Based on a subset of the [[High Efficiency Video Coding|HEVC]] open video compression standard.
* Supports the same chroma formats as [[JPEG]] (grayscale, YCbCr 4:2:0, 4:2:2, 4:4:4) to reduce the losses during the conversion. An alpha channel is supported. The [[RGB]], [[YCgCo]] and [[CMYK]] color spaces are also supported.
* Native support of 8 to 14 bits per channel for a [[high dynamic range imaging|higher dynamic range]].
* [[Lossless compression]] is supported.
* Various meta data (such as EXIF) can be included.

=== Vector formats ===
{{further|Vector graphics}}
As opposed to the raster image formats above (where the data describes the characteristics of each individual pixel), vector image formats contain a geometric description which can be rendered smoothly at any desired display size.

At some point, all vector graphics must be rasterized in order to be displayed on digital monitors. Vector images may also be displayed with analog [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] technology such as that used in some [[electronic test equipment]], [[medical monitors]], [[radar]] displays, [[Laser light show|laser shows]] and [[Spacewar!|early video games]]. [[Plotter]]s are printers that use vector data rather than pixel data to draw graphics.

==== CGM ====
CGM ([[Computer Graphics Metafile]]) is a file format for [[vector graphics|2D vector graphics]], raster graphics, and [[character (computer)|text]], and is defined by '''[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 8632'''. All [[computer graphics|graphical]] elements can be specified in a textual [[source file]] that can be compiled into a [[binary file]] or one of two text representations. CGM provides a means of graphics data interchange for computer representation of 2D graphical information independent from any particular application, system, platform, or device.
It has been adopted to some extent in the areas of [[engineering drawing|technical illustration]] and professional [[Industrial design|design]], but has largely been superseded by formats such as [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] and [[AutoCAD DXF|DXF]].

==== Gerber format (RS-274X) ====
The [[Gerber format]] (aka Extended Gerber, RS-274X) was developed by Gerber Systems Corp., now [[Ucamco]], and is a 2D bi-level image description format. It is the de facto standard format used by [[printed circuit board]] or PCB software. It is also widely used in other industries requiring high-precision 2D bi-level images.&lt;ref name="Gerber spec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucamco.com/en/guest/downloads|title=Gerber File Format Specification|publisher=Ucamco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== SVG ====
SVG ([[Scalable Vector Graphics]]) is an [[open standard]] created and developed by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] to address the need (and attempts of several corporations) for a versatile, [[DOM scripting|scriptable]] and all-purpose vector format for the web and otherwise. The SVG format does not have a compression scheme of its own, but due to the textual nature of [[XML]], an SVG graphic can be compressed using a program&lt;!--/algorithm/scheme?--&gt; such as [[gzip]]. Because of its scripting potential, SVG is a key component in [[web application]]s: interactive web pages that look and act like applications.

'''John Curtis''' (Born: Norwich, 3 September 1791: Died: 18 Belitha-villas, Islington, London: 6 October 1862) was an English [[Entomology|entomologist]] and [[illustrator]].

==Biography==
&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;From the Obituary Published in the Proceedings of the Linnaen Society, London. 1862.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

John Curtis (1791-1862)

In John Curtis we have lost one the most successful cultivators of British zoology and entomology, one of the most accomplished delineators of insects, and one of the closest observers of the phenomena of insect life.
Mr. Curtis was born at Norwich, on 3 December 1791, and died on 6 October 1862.

His father having died before the son had reached his fourth year, his training developed upon his mother, whose lover of flowers had no doubt great influence in the developing of that love of nature which he very early manifested. It is related that his notice, as a child, having been attracted by the large hairy caterpillar of Arctia Caia, which, to his great astonishment and delight, was transformed, whilst under his care, into a beautiful moth, entomology at once became his ruling passion. About this time, also, he became acquainted with an older and well-informed youth, Richard Walker, afterwards B.D, F.L.S., and Fellow of Magdalen, and the author of ‘Flora Oxoniensis’, in company with whom numerous excursions were made in the marshy districts surrounds his native place. He thus became much interested in the insects inhabiting and found upon the aquatic plants collected by his friend. These pursuits, however, were interrupted by a severe and even dangerous attack of rheumatic fever. On his recovery he was sent to school at Norwich, where he was again fortunate in making the acquaintance of a youth named Henry Browne, whose mother possessed a collection of British Lepidoptera, the inspection of which still further increased the zeal of Curtis in his old pursuits. Whilst at school, he captured the rare Stauropus Fagi on the lime-trees surrounding the Cathedral Close – an insect then so rare as to be valued by collectors at the price of £5; and to the time of his death he preserved a specimen of the almost equally rare Heliothis dipsacea, which he had captured under his hat, on Mousehold Heath, near Norwich. At an early age, also, he manifested a great love for colouring small engravings, and making drawings of flowers and landscapes. At this period his circle of acquaintance was enlarged by the addition to it of Dr. (afterwards Sir) James Edward Smith, and of the family of Mr. Hooker, the father of Sir W. J. Hooker. The latter was at this time an ardent entomologist, and he was of great assistance to young Curtis in the naming of insects, and giving him rare and local species. An excursion to the fens of Horning was rewarded by the capture of Papilio Machaon and its lava on Selinum palustre, as well of Hypogymna dispar.

When sixteen years of age, being obliged to choose a profession, he entered the office of a lawyer, although when there, dry legal technicalities were but little to his taste, and his desk probably contained more of natural history than of law. After two years thus occupied, Mr, Curtis became acquainted with Mr. Simon Wilkin, a wealthy land proprietor in Norfolk, who like himself, was passionately devoted to entomology. This gentleman, on reaching twenty-one, came to reside on his estate at Cossey Hall, where he invited Curtis to live with him as his companion. Here, with a well-stored library, a well-named collection of insects, and congenial associates, the two friends spent their time most happily; and an entomological society was formed, in which the names of the Revs. W. Kirby and J. Burrell, Messrs. Wilkin, Brightwell, Joseph Hooker, John Lindley, Joseph Sparshall, and ten or twelve more were enrolled a members, - Mr. Wilkin acting as President and Mr. Curtis as Secretary.

Mr. Wilkin having successfully studied Latreille’s ‘Genera Crustaceorum’, Curtis became so charmed with that naturalist’s system that he formed a resolution to describe and delineate all the genera, and thenceforward lost no opportunity of making dissections and drawings of the types of all he could obtain, or copies of figures of exotic genera from the most esteemed Continental works. To promote his object, he acquired the art of etching and engraving on copper, his first published essay being the plates for Kirby and Spence’s ‘Introduction to Entomology’. Of these plates five only, containing figures illustrating the different orders of insects, were at first published, in the first and second volumes of that work, the third and fourth of which did not appear till 1826. The latter two contained twenty-five plates, filled with details of the external and internal anatomy of insects, twenty of which were etched by Curtis and five by Henry Denny, the dissections having been for the most part made by Mr. Kirby.

Mr. Curtis, at this time, frequently made sketches from nature; and about 1816 he cultivated, more especially, a taste he had long entertained for the drawing of churches, fonts, and monuments, the views being coloured on the spot. A visit to Barham, the residence of the Rev. W. Kirby, led to his making the acquaintance of Mr. Spence and of Mr. W. S. MacLeay, friends who proved of the greatest utility to him. Here he also assisted Mr. Kirby in dissecting and illustrating the forms contained in the famous ‘Century of Insects,’ and in the descriptions of Mr. Robert Brown’s ‘Australian Insects,’ published by Mr. Kirby in the 12th volume of our Transactions (1818).

In 1819 he accompanied Mr. Kirby to London, where he was introduced to Sir Joseph Banks, who gave him the entrée to his library and soirées, at which all the élite of the scientific world of London used to assemble. He also became personally acquainted with Dr. Leach, Superintendent of the Zoological Collection of the Museum, their congenial tastes soon rendering them intimate friends, and leading Curtis to study the structure of shells and their inhabitants, in which pursuit Dr. Leach was so greatly interested that an arrangement was made to examine and dredge the whole coast of Scotland in search of Mollusca. This excursion however, was never carried out, Dr. Leach’s mind having broken down under the accumulated labours which he had heaped upon himself.

The battle of life now began in earnest; and having thus lost the advice and assistance of the first zoologists whom England has ever produced, Mr. Curtis (by the evidence of Mr. MacLeay and other friends) turned his attention to botanical drawing and engraving, which led to engagements with Dr. Sims, and introduced him to the Horticultural Society (of which his friend Dr. Lindley was Secretary), the Linnaen Society, &amp;c. In 1822 he was elected a Fellow of this Society; and on 1 January 1824 appeared the first number of ‘[[British Entomology]],’ "being Illustrations and Description of the genera of Insects found in Great Britain and Ireland, containing coloured figures from nature of the most rare and beautiful species, and in manty instances of the plants upon which they are found." This great work extended to sixteen annual volumes, containing no less than 770 plates, occupied by what the unanimous consent of entomologists has pronounced to be the most exquisite figures of the kind ever produced. The work, as originally designed, was intended to embrace only a detailed description of the genus and of the species figured, accompanied with observations on the generic peculiarities of the group. This limited scope was proposed, partly, because it was known that the late J. Francis Stephens had long been engaged in preparing for publication a work on the species of British insects, the first number of which appeared on 1 May 1827. Entomologists, however, are but human; and it unfortunately happened that jealousies and ill-feeling soon arose between these two authors, which resulted, on the part of Mr. Curtis, in his introducing into his work, wherever possible, descriptions of each species of the different genera, or of lists of the species, at any rate when too numerous for description. The author’s attention, from this circumstance, was in some measure withdrawn from the generic to the specific details, and accordingly, to the end, continued to confine his detailed generic figures to the structure of the antennae and parts of the mouth, omitting all mention, in many instances, of particulars concerning other parts, which more profound entomologists have shown to possess generic or family value. The same spirit also led to the commencement of the publication of a second edition of the ‘British Entomology,’ in which detailed descriptions of known British species were intended to be given in the text; but of this second edition two parts only appeared.

In 1825, Mr. Curtis, in company with his friend Mr. Dale of Glanville’s Wooton, a most assiduous collector of British insects, made an entomological tour in Perthshire and the western isles of Scotland, returning by way of Edinburgh. In this tour they were successful in collecting many very rare insects, together with thirty species not previously known as British, as well numerous drawings of wild flowers for the illustration of Mr. Curtis’s great work.

In 1829 he published the first edition of a ‘Guide to an Arrangement of British Insects.’ "printed on one side, for labelling cabinets, being a Catalogue of all the names species hitherto discovered in Great Britain and Ireland," a second edition of which useful work appeared in 1837. In the following year, in company with Messrs. Francis and Henry Walker, he visited France, proceeding along the western edge of Bordeaux, and thence to Fréjus. In this journey about 6000 specimens of insects were collected; but the great object of the party was to visit the gypsum-quarries at Aix in Provence, where fossil insects are frequently found, of which Mr. Curtis, in 1829, had already described in the ‘Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal,’ a number of species brought by Messrs. Murchison and Lyell.

In 1831 Mr. Curtis was elected Corresponding Member of the Royal Georgofili Society of Florence, and in the same year he published a "Description of the Insects brought home by Commander James Clark Ross in his Second Voyage," forming part of the Appendix of Natural History.
In 1833, on the occasion of his reading a paper "On the Structure of Insects" before the Ashmolean Society of Oxford, he was elected an Honorary Member of that body; and in 1836 he received the same title from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.

On the completion of his ‘[[British Entomology]],’ on 1 December 1839, Mr. Curtis sought for relaxation from the incessant application monthly required during the long space of sixteen years; but in 1841, his friend Dr. Lindley having commenced the ‘Gardeners’ Chronicle,’ Curtis undertook the entomological editorship, engaging to write articles on the insects injurious to gardeners and farmers, in a popular style, accompanied by figures on wood; and this task he continued to perform with unabating industry till 1847, when it was taken up by Mr. Westwood.

Having accumulated a large mass of materials relative to the economy of insects, and being invited by the Council of the Royal Agricultural Society of London to furnish reports upon the insects injurious to farm-crops, he visited Suffolk to consult the best farmers on the subject. These valuable reports, amounting to sixteen in number, were commenced in 1841, and concluded in 1857. They were published in the ‘Journal’ of the Society, each being illustrated by one or more plates containing figures of insects in their different stages, and have subsequently been collected together and published in a single volume, under the title of "Farm Insects, being the Natural History and Economy on the Insects injurious to the field-crops of Great Britain and Ireland, and also those which infest barns and granaries, with suggestions for their destruction."

In 1843 Mr. Curtis made a tour in Italy, visiting Rome, Naples, and other principal cities of the south to enjoy the sight of the architectural and other artistic treasures of which he had read much when studying painting in his early life. In 1844 he left London, and went to reside at Hayes, near Uxbridge, where he occupied himself for five years studying the economy of noxious insects in the field and garden.

In 1849 he was elected a Corresponding Member of the National History Society of Nuremberg; and in 1855 he was chosen an Honorary Member of the Entomological Society of Paris, of which he had, however, been an ordinary Member since 1834. In the autumn and winter of 1850 he visited Nice, Genoa, Turin, and the North of Italy, returning by the Tyrol and Switzerland; and in the latter part of 1851, he visited Pau, the various cities along the Mediterranean, Venice, Florence, Lombardy, Switzerland, and France, continuing, nevertheless, to furnish communications on entomological subjects to various publications, and, amongst these, one to the ‘Linnean Transactions,’ in 1852, "On the Economy of a New Species of Saw-fly (Selandria Robinsoni), the lavae of which feed upon Convallaria multiflora," and a "Notice regarding a Weevil of the vine and its Parasite (Rhynchites Betuleti)," in the ‘Proceedings’ for 1853; "On the genus Myrmica and other indigenous Ants," in the ‘Linnaen Transactions,’ 1854, &amp;c.

The publication of so national a work as the ‘British Entomology,’ together with the great practical utility of his numerous memoires on economic entomology, fully justified the grant of an annuity of £100 which was conferred some years since upon Mr. Curtis, and subsequently augmented by an additional £50 on the occurrence of a sad event which took place shortly after the first grant of the pension, namely, the total loss of sight, induced, it is supposed, by the overstraining of the eyes in the execution of his numerous and laborious works.
Resigned to this great misfortune, Mr. Curtis retired from scientific life, in which for forty years he taken such an active part; and soon afterwards his friends were grieved to learn that he was suffering from the severe illness which terminated in his decease last year.
The collection of British insects formed by Mr. Curtis is of great value, from its extent and the number of original types in all the different orders which it contains. It is also a model of the greatest neatness and order. This, in fact, was one of the great peculiarities of Mr. Curtis, and pervaded all he did and all he possessed – his library being in the choicest condition, and his drawings most carefully finished. A little anecdote communicated to Mr. Westwood by Mr. Frederick Smith well illustrates this peculiarity. Mr. Smith was employed to engrave some of the plates of the ‘British Entomology’ and of the memoires on ‘Farm Insects;’ and on one occasion when one of his plates was taken by Mr. Smith to be approved, Mr. Curtis, having carefully examined the impression for a considerable time, at last turned to Mr. Smith and said, "Sir, you have only put twelve hairs upon this fly’s tail instead of thirteen!" This complaint, indicating so great a perception of precision, had such a droll effect, that the workmen could not resist a hearty laugh.

Personally, Mr. Curtis was very reserved in his communication with such of his brother entomologists as were known to be engaged in works intended for publication; but to those with whom he held unreserved intercourse his manners were engaging and kind. To use the words, in a letter to Mr. Westwood, of Mr. Halliday, who had enjoyed an uninterrupted friendship with Mr. Curtis of more than thirty years, "he was indeed very loveable, warm-hearted (too much so perhaps for his own tranquillity), pure-minded, and honourable."

==Contacts==
Curtis was a lifelong friend of the Irish entomologist [[Alexander Henry Haliday]] and of the London entomologist [[Francis Walker (entomologist)|Francis Walker]]. Curtis met Haliday in December 1827, (following an exchange of letters and specimens) Curtis’s second child was named Henry Alexander and Haliday was his [[Godparent|godfather]].

" ''I was delighted to possess Ceraphron Halidayii first because I had named it after you.... it is very essential to possess those insects I figure: the female of Scatophaga also was a most valuable addition. Tipula dispar I only had the male of, I never could understand the female but thought it had been killed before the wings were fully expanded, never having taken it myself and I need scarcely say there was not an insect you sent me that was not fully acceptable ...... I will put into the box some British Ichneumonidae hoping you will do me the favour at your leisure to append to them their Generic names and if you know them the specific also but not to take any trouble about it and whenever there are 2 alike I beg you will take one if desirable. Pray do me the favour to answer the different questions in this letter as I have no copy or memorandum.I shall hope to hear shortly from you and sincerely wishing you in a good old English Phrase a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.Yours most faithfully, John Curtis''" Curtis to Haliday 22 December 1832.

"''To Alexander Henry Haliday, Esq., M.A., &amp;c, of Belfast, whose extensive knowledge and munificent contributions, have so greatly enriched this work and whose kindness and friendship in its progress have been an uninterrupted source of gratification, to the author, this volume'' (British Entomology VII Homoptera. Hemiptera. Aphaniptera) ''is dedicated as a token of sincere regard''". London 1 December 1837.

"''It has for several years been my wish to pay you the only public testimony in my power of my regard by dedicating a volumne of my work to you. The many and essential services you have rendered that work during its progress would entitle you to such a compliment were you only a correspondent and the numerous proofs I had of your kindness and friend-ship make me only regret that it will not be better with your acceptance. I assure you one of the greatest pleasures in the progress of my great undertaking has been the associating my name with those whom I esteem and who like myself fare devote to the study of our branch of Natural History I may have only two more opportunities of thus gratifying myself and I shall be truly happy if they afford me the same unmixed pleasures as the present one does''" …Curtis to Haliday 2 December 1837

==Selected works==
*1 January 1824 - 1 December 1839: First Edition of '''[[British Entomology]]''' comprising detailed description of the insects of Great Britain and Ireland with 770 hand-coloured plates and over 2,000 species described. Issued in 192 monthly parts over 16 years to an initial list of 167 subscribers, yet less than 35 complete copies of the first edition were finally produced. Universally acknowledged as being the finest work concerning British entomology ever produced. The exceptionally fine images included the most accurate botanical illustrations that have yet to be bettered. Note: Title pages incorrectly show publication dates as 1823 - 1840.
*1837 Second edition of '''[[A Guide to the Arrangement of British Insects]]''' being a catalogue of all the named species hitherto discovered in Great Britain and Ireland. Six pages of introductory matter are followed by 282 columns of insect names in two columns per page systematically arranged and followed by an index to genera. This work attributed to John Curtis was in fact co-authored by [[James Charles Dale]], [[Francis Walker (entomologist)|Francis Walker]] and [[Alexander Henry Haliday]]; Haliday and Walker writing almost the whole of the sections on [[Diptera]] and parasitic [[Hymenoptera]]. The list contains 1500 generic and 15,000 specific names. [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] are not separated.

'''Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator''' ('''LAMMPS''') is a [[molecular dynamics]] program from [[Sandia National Laboratories]].&lt;ref name="LAMMPS"&gt;{{cite web
 | title= LAMMPS Molecular Dynamics Simulator 
 | publisher= Sandia National Laboratories
 | url= http://lammps.sandia.gov/
 | accessdate= 2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; LAMMPS makes use of [[Message Passing Interface]] (MPI) for parallel communication and is [[free and open-source software]], distributed under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]].&lt;ref name="LAMMPS"/&gt;

LAMMPS was originally developed under a [[Cooperative Research and Development Agreement]] (CRADA) between two laboratories from [[United States Department of Energy]] and three other laboratories from private sector firms.&lt;ref name="LAMMPS"/&gt; {{As of|2016}}, it is maintained and distributed by researchers at the [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and [[Temple University]].&lt;ref name="LAMMPS"/&gt;

== Features ==

For computing efficiency, LAMMPS uses neighbor lists ([[Verlet list]]s) to keep track of nearby particles. The lists are optimized for systems with particles that repel at short distances, so that the local density of particles never grows too large.

On parallel computers, LAMMPS uses spatial-decomposition techniques to partition the simulation domain into small 3d sub-domains, one of which is assigned to each processor. Processors communicate and store ''ghost'' atom information for atoms that border their subdomain. LAMMPS is most efficient (in a parallel computing sense) for systems whose particles fill a 3D rectangular box with approximately uniform density.

The '''Life Science Library''' is a series of hardbound books published by [[Time Life]] between 1963 and 1967. Each of the 26 volumes explores a major topic of the [[natural sciences]]. They are intended for, and written at a level appropriate to, an educated lay readership. In each volume, the text of each of eight chapters is followed by a "Picture Essay" lavishly illustrating the subject of the preceding chapter. They were available in a monthly subscription from ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. Each volume takes complex scientific concepts and provides explanations that can be easily understood. For example, [[Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] is explained in a cartoon about a spy drama involving a train traveling very close to the speed of light; probability is explained with poker hands; and the [[periodic table of the elements]] is conveyed with common household items. Although progress has overtaken much of the material in the more than 50 years since their publication, the series' explanations of basic science and the history of discovery remain valid. The consulting editors of the series are [[microbiologist]] [[René Dubos]], [[physicist]] [[Henry Margenau]], and physicist and novelist [[C. P. Snow]].

Each volume was written by a primary author or authors, "and the Editors of ''LIFE''". The volumes are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5688">Historically, there have been cases where the '''extermination of animal species has been politically endorsed''' because the animals have been considered harmful. In some cases the animals have been hunted because the animals present a danger to human lives, at other times they have been hunted because they are harmful to human interests such as [[livestock]] [[farming]]. More recently, eradication efforts have focused on invasive vertebrates as they are the leading cause of extinction of native species, particularly on islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are Invasive Alien Species?|url=https://www.cbd.int/idb/2009/about/what/|publisher=CBD Secretariat|accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article refers to animals in a more limited sense; it does not include [[humans]].

In a number of cases, such government endorsed hunting has led to the endangerment or outright extinction of the species.

==Rat==
[[Alberta]], Canada is one of the few non-island places in the world that is free of [[brown rat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3441?opendocument | title=The History of Rat Control in Alberta| publisher=Alberta Department of Agriculture| accessdate=January 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1950s, the [[Government of Alberta]] has operated a rat-control program, which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported, usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail.

A number of islands have had programs to remove introduced rats and improve conditions for native fauna. Some of these islands include:

*[[Breaksea Island (New Zealand)|Breaksea Island]] and [[Campbell Island, New Zealand|Campbell Island]], [[New Zealand]] have successfully eradicated [[brown rat]]s.  The program was carried out by the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|New Zealand Department of Conservation]] (DOC).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Thomas (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2004), pp.282-283.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pinzón Island]], one of the [[Galápagos Islands]] has a rat eradication program which has contributed to a rebound in [[Galápagos tortoise]] populations there.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2015/01/19/galapagos-tortoises-comeback-rat-eradication/&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hawadax Island]] in the western [[Aleutian Islands]] in the US state of Alaska also had a successful rat eradication program in the 2000s.

== [[Thylacine]] ==
* The thylacine was a [[Tasmania]]n predator which was responsible for a significant number of attacks on unconfined livestock, leading to a public sentiment of hostility against the species. A bounty of between 6/- (for fewer than ten kills) and 10/- (for each kill beyond ten) on the thylacine was established by the Van Diemen's Land Co in 1836. In 1888 the government introduced a bounty of £1 for each adult scalp, and 10/- per juvenile, and a number of sheep farmers offered similar rewards. The subsequent slaughter of the animals was a key factor in their extinction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalworlds.org/thylacine/naturalhistory/history/history_1805_1936_1.htm The Natural History of Thylacinus Cynocephalus]&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Tiger]] ==
=== [[Caspian tiger]] ===
* In the 1900s (decade) the [[Russian government]] declared that there is no place for [[tiger]]s in [[Central Asia]] and [[Caucasus]]. The Russian army was tasked with the extermination of all tigers in the Caspian Sea area so that farmers could move in. It is unknown whether the Caspian tiger is entirely extinct since there are some reports of sightings in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lairweb.org.nz/tiger/caspian.html The Caspian Tiger]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[South China tiger]] ===
* In 1950 the population of the South China tiger was approximately 4000. The species was declared a pest by [[Mao Zedong]] as part of the [[Great Leap Forward]] programme and subjected to uncontrolled hunting. This hunting, combined with the ravages of [[deforestation]] led to the dramatic reduction of the Chinese tiger population. Regulations restricting the hunting of such tigers were implemented during the 1970s but they were not greatly respected. By 1982 their numbers had dwindled to 150-200, and now they are almost extinct in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0030605304000079 Dramatic decline of wild South China tigers ''Panthera tigris amoyensis: field survey of priority tiger reserves] Ronald Tilson, Hu Defu, Jeff Muntifering, Philip J. Nyhus. Published in ''Oryx'', vol 38, pp 40-47, January 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Wolf]] ==
* Wolves are predators which frequently target domestic sheep, a fact which frequently brings sheep farmers who want the wolves gone into conflict with conservationists. In various [[Europe]]an countries such as [[Norway]], the wolf was declared a pest and subjected to systematic eradication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/wildeurope_20020708.shtml Wild Europe: Norway's Wolves] BBC Radio 4 program trailer&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Japan]] during the [[Meiji period|Meiji Period]], hunting of the wolves in [[Hokkaidō]] led to the extinction of the [[Hokkaidō wolf|Japanese]] [[subspecies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/eh/9.2/walker.html Meiji Modernization, Scientific: Agriculture, and the Destruction of Japan's Hokkaido Wolf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040926013455/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/eh/9.2/walker.html |date=2004-09-26 }} Brett L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1632">'''MaMF''', or Mammalian Motif Finder, is an algorithm for identifying [[Sequence motif|motifs]] to which [[transcription factors]] bind.

The algorithm takes as input a set of [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] sequences, and a motif width(w), and as output, produces a ranked list of 30 predicted motifs(each motif is defined by a set of N sequences, where N is a parameter).

The algorithm firstly [[index (database)|index]]es each sub-sequence of length n, where n is a parameter around 4-6 [[base pairs]], in each promoter, so they can be looked up efficiently. This index is then used to build a list of all pairs of sequences of length w, such that each sequence shares an [[n-mer]], and each sequence forms an ungapped [[Sequence alignment|alignment]] with a substring of length w from the string of length 2w around the match, with a score exceeding a cut-off.

The pairs of sequences are then scored. The scoring function favours pairs which are very similar, but disfavours sequences which are very common in the target genome. The 1000 highest scoring pairs are kept, and the others are discarded. Each of these 1000 'seed' motifs are then used to search iteratively search for further sequences of length which maximise the score(a [[greedy algorithm]]), until N sequences for that motif are reached.

Very similar motifs are discarded, and the 30 highest scoring motifs are returned as output.

'''Maldevelopment''' is the state of an organism or an organisation that did not develop in the "normal" way (used in medicine, e.g. "brain maldevelopment of a fetus"). It was introduced as a human and social development term in [[France]] in the 1990s by [[Samir Amin]] to challenge the concept of "[[underdevelopment]]." The word ''maldéveloppement'' did not exist before then (the medical terms are ''malformation'' or ''développement anormal''), so the word is a [[neologism]] meant to be analogous to the difference between [[undernutrition]] and [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crcpress.com/Evolutionary-Change-Toward-a-Systemic-Theory-of-Development-and-Maldevelopment/Katsenelinboigen/p/book/9789056995294|title=Evolutionary Change: Toward a Systemic Theory of Development and Maldevelopment|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maldevelopment is a global concept that includes human and social development. Under the philosophy of [[sustainable development]], economic development is only a "tool" that allows for greater human and social development, not the final goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amerika.org/texts/is-development-good-for-the-third-world-vandana-shiva/|title=Is ‘Development’ Good For The Third World? (Vandana Shiva) «  Amerika|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Under''-development is a quantitative notion, implying that a nation has a lack and must gain something to reach a particular reference state—the state of the nation that judges another nation as underdeveloped.  So this notion also implies a unique development model—the one of the judging nation.

''Mal''-development, or ''ill''-development, is a qualitative notion that expresses a mismatch, a discrepancy between the conditions (economic, political, meteorological, cultural, etc.) and the needs and means of the people.

{{other uses|Middle Ages (disambiguation)}}

{{Human growth and development}}
'''Middle age''' is the period of age beyond [[Young adult (psychology)|young adult]]hood but before the onset of [[old age]].&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;uid=1986-19674-001|title=PsycNET - Option to Buy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' middle age is between 45 and 65:&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/middle-age|title=Middle Age: definition of middle age in Oxford dictionary (American· English) (US)|website=Oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The period between early adulthood and old age, usually considered as the years from about 45 to 65." The US Census lists the category middle age from 45 to 65. [[Merriam-Webster]] lists middle age from 45 to 64,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/middle%20age|title=Definition of MIDDLE AGE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while prominent psychologist [[Erik Erikson]] saw it starting a little earlier and defines middle adulthood as between 40 and 65. The ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' lists it between the ages of 40 and 60,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/middle-age Middle age]. CollinsDictionary.com. ''Collins English Dictionary'' – Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved December 05, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' – the standard diagnostic manual of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] – used to define middle age as 40 to 60, but as of ''[[DSM-IV|DSM-IV (1994)]]'' revised the definition upwards to 45 to 65.

==Young adulthood==
{{Further|Young adult (psychology)}}
This time in the lifespan is considered to be the developmental stage of those who are between 18 years old and 40 years old. Recent developmental theories have recognized that development occurs across the entire life of a person as they experience changes cognitively, physically, socially, and in personality.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version (W. W. Norton, 1998),&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle adulthood==
This time period in the life of a person can be referred to as middle age. This time span has been defined as the time between ages 45 and 65 years old.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Many changes may occur between young adulthood and this stage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oMsXWRjHRfwC&amp;dq=cognitive%20decline%20may%20occur%20with%20age&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Aging Auditory System|first1=Sandra|last1=Gordon-Salant|first2=Robert D.|last2=Frisina|first3=Richard R.|last3=Fay|first4=Arthur|last4=Popper|date=3 May 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The body may slow down and the middle aged might become more sensitive to diet, substance abuse, stress, and rest. Chronic health problems can become an issue along with disability or disease. Approximately one centimeter of height may be lost per decade.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/health/osteoporosis-diagnosis#Overview1|title=Osteoporosis Tests and Diagnosis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional responses and retrospection vary from person to person. Experiencing a sense of mortality, sadness, or loss is common at this age.&lt;ref name=ted2016/&gt;

Those in middle adulthood or middle age continue to develop relationships and adapt to the changes in relationships. Changes can be the interacting with growing and grown children and aging parents. Community involvement is fairly typical of this stage of adulthood,&lt;ref name=ted2016&gt;{{cite book | last = Stern | first = Theodore | title = Massachusetts General Hospital comprehensive clinical psychiatry | publisher = Elsevier | location = London | year = 2016 | isbn = 978-0-323-29507-9|postscript=.  Access provided by the University of Pittsburgh. }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as continued career development.

===Physical characteristics===
Middle-aged adults may begin to show visible signs of [[aging]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; This process can be more rapid in women who have osteoporosis. Changes might occur in the nervous system. The ability to perform complex tasks remains intact. Women experience [[menopause]] in the years surrounding the age of 50, which ends natural fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SozvHsW4VysC&amp;pg=PA435&amp;dq=gynecology%20menopause%20range%2048-55&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_gM2egYzOAhULPT4KHWQ5A28Q6AEINjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Obstetrics and Gynecology Recall|first1=F. John|last1=Bourgeois|first2=Paola A.|last2=Gehrig|first3=Daniel S.|last3=Veljovich|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menopause can have many side effects, some welcome and some not so welcome. Men may also experience physical changes. Changes can occur to [[Skin#Age|skin]] and other changes may include decline in [[physical fitness]] including a reduction in aerobic performance and a decrease in maximal heart rate. These measurements are generalities and people may exhibit these changes at different rates and times.

The mortality rate can begin to increase from 45 and onwards, mainly due to health problems like heart problems, [[cancer]], [[hypertension]], and [[diabetes]].&lt;ref name=ted2016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db193.htm|title=Products - Data Briefs - Number 193 - March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Still, the majority of middle-aged people in industrialized nations can expect to live into [[old age]].

===Cognitive characteristics===
Erik Erikson refers to this period of adulthood as the generatitivity-versus-stagnation stage. Persons in middle adulthood or middle age may have some cognitive loss. This loss usually remains unnoticeable because life experiences and strategies are developed to compensate for any decrease in mental abilities.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

===Social and personality characteristics===
Marital satisfaction remains but other family relationships can be more difficult. Career satisfaction focuses more on inner satisfaction and contentedness and less on ambition and the desire to "advance".&lt;ref name=ted2016/&gt; Even so, career changes often can occur. Middle adulthood or middle age can be a time when a person re-examines their life by taking stock, and evaluating their accomplishments. Morality may change and become more conscious. The perception that those in this stage of development or life undergo a "mid-life" crisis is largely false. This period in life is usually satisfying, tranquil. Personality characteristics remain stable throughout this period.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  The relationships in middle adulthood may continue to evolve into connections that are stable.&lt;ref name=ted2016/&gt;

'''''Physics of the Future: How Science Will Shape Human Destiny and Our Daily Lives by the Year 2100''''' is a 2011 book by [[theoretical physicist]] [[Michio Kaku]], author of ''[[Hyperspace (book)|Hyperspace]]'' and ''[[Physics of the Impossible]]''. In it Kaku speculates about possible [[future]] technological development over the next 100 years. He interviews notable [[scientists]] about their fields of research and lays out his vision of coming developments in [[medicine]], [[computing]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[nanotechnology]], and [[energy production]].  The book was on the [[New York Times]] Bestseller List for five weeks.&lt;ref name="bestseller"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2011-05-01/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|title=Best Sellers|date=1 May 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=24 May 2011|first=Jennifer|last=Schuessler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaku writes how he hopes his predictions for 2100 will be as successful as [[science fiction]] writer [[Jules Verne|Jules Verne's]] 1863 novel ''[[Paris in the Twentieth Century]]''. Kaku contrasts Verne's foresight against U.S. Postmaster General [[John Wanamaker]], who in 1893 predicted that mail would still be delivered by [[stagecoach]] and horseback in 100 years' time, and [[IBM]] chairman [[Thomas J. Watson]], who in 1943 is alleged to have said "I think there is a world market for maybe five computers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaku|first=Michio|title=Physics of the Future|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/03/26/134600339/no-flying-car-but-how-about-an-invisibility-cloak|work=Excerpt|publisher=NPR|accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kaku points to this long history of failed predictions against progress to underscore his notion "that it is very dangerous to bet against the future".

==Contents==
Each chapter is sorted into three sections: Near future (2000-2030), Midcentury (2030-2070), and Far future (2070-2100). Kaku notes that the time periods are only rough approximations, but show the general time frame for the various trends in the book.

===Future of the Computer: Mind over Matter===
Kaku begins with [[Moore's law]], and compares a chip that sings "Happy Birthday" with the Allied forces in 1945, stating that the chip contains much more power, and that "Hitler, Churchill, or Roosevelt might have killed to get that chip." He predicts that computer power will increase to the point where computers, like electricity, paper, and water, "disappear into the fabric of our lives, and computer chips will be planted in the walls of buildings."

He also predicts that glasses and contact lenses will be connected to the internet, using similar technology to [[virtual retinal display]]s. Cars will become driverless due to the power of the [[GPS system]]. This prediction is supported by the results of the [[DARPA Grand Challenge|Urban Challenge]]. [[The Pentagon]] hopes to make {{frac|1|3}} of the United States ground forces automated by 2015. Technology similar to [[BrainGate]] will eventually allow humans to control computers with tiny brain sensors, and "like a magician, move objects around with the power of our minds."

===Future of AI: Rise of the Machines===
Kaku discusses robotic body parts, modular robots, unemployment caused by robots, surrogates and avatars (like their respective movies), and reverse engineering the brain. Kaku goes over the [[three laws of robotics]] and their contradictions. He endorses a "chip in robot brains to automatically shut them off if they have murderous thoughts", and believes that the most likely scenario is one in which robots are free to wreak havoc and destruction, but are designed to desire benevolence.

===Future of Medicine: Perfection and Beyond===
Kaku believes that in the future, reprogramming one's genes can be done by using a specially programmed [[virus]], which can activate genes that slow the aging process. Nanotech sensors in a room will check for various diseases and cancer, nanobots will be able to inject drugs into individual cells when diseases are found, and advancements in extracting [[stem cells]] will be manifest in the art of growing new organs. The idea of resurrecting an extinct species might now be biologically possible.

===Nanotechnology: Everything from Nothing?===
Kaku  discusses [[programmable matter]], [[quantum computer]]s, [[carbon nanotube]]s, and the possibility of [[Replicator (Star Trek)|replicators]]. He also expects a variety of [[nanotechnology|nanodevice]]s that search and destroy cancer cells cleanly, leaving normal cells intact.

===Future of Energy: Energy from the Stars===
Kaku discusses the draining of oil on the planet by pointing to the [[Hubbert curve]], and the rising problem of immigrants who wish to live the American dream of wasteful energy consumption. He predicts that hydrogen and solar energy will be the future, noting how Henry Ford and Thomas Edison bet on whether oil or electricity would dominate, and describing fusion with lasers or magnetic fields, and dismisses [[cold fusion]] as "a dead end". Kaku suggests that nations are reluctant to deal with global warming because the extravagance of oil, being the cheapest source of energy, encourages economic growth. Kaku believes that in the far future, room-temperature [[superconductor]]s will usher the era of magnet-powered floating cars and trains.

===Future of Space Travel: To the Stars===
Unlike conventional chemical rockets which use Newton's [[Newton's laws of motion|third law of motion]], solar sails take advantage of [[radiation pressure]] from stars. Kaku believes that after sending a gigantic [[solar sail]] into orbit, one could install lasers on the moon, which would hit the sail and give it extra momentum.

Another alternative is to send thousands of nanoships, of which only a few would reach their destination. "Once arriving on a nearby moon, they could create a factory to make unlimited copies of themselves," says Kaku. Nanoships would require very little fuel to accelerate. They could visit the stellar neighborhood by floating on the magnetic fields of other planets.

===Future of Wealth: Winners and Losers===
Kaku discusses how Moore's law  robotics will affect the future of [[capitalism]], which nations will survive and grow, how the United States is "[[brain-drain]]ing" off of immigrants to fuel their economy.

===Future of Humanity: Planetary Civilization===
Kaku ranks the civilization of the future, with classifications based on [[Kardashev scale|energy consumption]], entropy, and information processing. Kaku stated that humans with an average economic growth may attain [[planetary civilization]] status in 100 years, "unless there is a natural catastrophe or some calamitous act of folly, it is inevitable that we will
enter this phase of our collective history".

==Reception==
The book got mixed reviews, and was generally regarded as having interesting insights that were delivered in an over-optimistic but bland style.

&lt;!-- positive --&gt;
''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' stated "The author’s scientific expertise will engage readers too sophisticated for predictions based on psychic powers or astrology."&lt;ref name="kirkusreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/non-fiction/michio-kaku/physics-future/#review|title=PHYSICS OF THE FUTURE by Michio Kaku |work=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewers at ''[[Library Journal]]'' have stated, "This work is highly recommended for fans of Kaku’s previous books and for readers interested in science and robotics."&lt;ref name="libraryjournalreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/reviewsbook/888573-421/science__technology_reviews_february.html.csp|title=Science &amp; Technology Reviews, February 1, 2011|accessdate=24 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425180324/http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/reviewsbook/888573-421/science__technology_reviews_february.html.csp|archivedate=25 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- remarks on optimism --&gt;
The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' considers it a "largely optimistic view of the future".&lt;ref name="wsjreview"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704433904576213683603852312|title=Book Review: Physics of the Future - WSJ.com|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=24 May 2011|date=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' complained that "[Physics of the Future] is partisan about technology in a way that smacks of [[Gerard K. O'Neill]]’s deliriously [[Technocracy|technocratic]] vision of space exploration, ''[[The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space|The High Frontier]]''."&lt;ref name="telegraphreview"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/8453941/Physics-of-the-Future-by-Michio-Kaku-review.html|title=Physics of the Future by Michio Kaku: review - Telegraph|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=24 May 2011|location=London|first=Simon|last=Ings|date=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated "despite the relentless technological optimism, Kaku does conjure up a genuinely exciting panorama of revolutionary science and magical technology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=P. D.|title=Physics of the Future by Michio Kaku – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/27/physics-future-michio-kaku-review|accessdate=2 February 2018|work=the Guardian|date=27 March 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- other remarks, including style --&gt;
The ''[[New York Times]]'' complained the book's style is often "dull and charmless", but acknowledged it had the ability to "enthrall and frighten" as well. Writing in ''[[Physics Today]]'', physicist [[Neil Gershenfeld]] said that the book has “an appealing premise” but describes “a kind of future by committee” populated by “science-fiction staples”. Gershenfeld said, “Such a forecast could have been accomplished with less effort by collating covers from popular science magazines.” Gershenfeld criticizes Kaku for “some surprising physics errors”, such as ignoring air friction on [[maglev|maglev vehicles]]. Kaku is praised for raising “profound questions”, such as the effect of affluence in the future, or the decoupling of [[perception|sensory experience]] from reality. However, Gershenfeld laments that these questions are asked in the margins and not given a deep treatment. “It would have been more relevant to learn the author’s perspective on these questions than to find out where and to whom he’s presented lectures,” Gershenfeld said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Physics of the Future | journal = Physics Today | date = October 2011 | first = Neil | last = Gershenfeld | volume = 64 | issue = 10 | page = 56| id = | doi=10.1063/pt.3.1299}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' is skeptical about prediction in general pointing out that unforeseen "unknown unknowns" led to many [[Disruptive technology|disruptive technologies]] over the century just past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspension of disbelief: known unknowns and unknown unknowns|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18329654|accessdate=26 May 2011|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project Gemini''' was [[NASA]]'s second [[human spaceflight]] program. Conducted between projects [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Project Apollo|Apollo]], Gemini started in 1961 and concluded in 1966. The Gemini spacecraft carried a two-astronaut crew. Ten Gemini crews flew [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) missions during 1965 and 1966, putting the [[United States]] in the lead during the [[Cold War]] [[Space Race]] against the [[Soviet Union]].

Gemini's objective was the development of space travel techniques to support the Apollo mission to [[Moon landing|land astronauts on the Moon]]. It performed missions long enough for a trip to the [[Moon]] and back, perfected working outside the spacecraft with [[Extravehicular activity|extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA), and pioneered the [[orbital maneuver]]s necessary to achieve [[space rendezvous]] and [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|docking]]. With these new techniques proven by Gemini, Apollo could pursue its prime mission without doing these fundamental exploratory operations.

All Gemini flights were launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 19|Launch Complex 19]] (LC-19) at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Kennedy Air Force Station]] in Florida. Their [[launch vehicle]] was the Gemini–[[Titan II GLV|Titan II]], a modified [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|Intercontinental Ballistic Missile]] (ICBM).&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The only Gemini spacecraft not launched by a Titan II was the reflight of [[Gemini 2]] for a [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] test in 1966, which used a [[Titan IIIC]]&lt;/ref&gt; Gemini was the first program to use the newly built [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] at the Houston [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]] for [[Flight controller#NASA's Flight Controllers|flight control]].&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;[[Gemini 3]] used the [[Mercury Control Center]] located at Cape Kennedy for flight control, as the new center was still in a test status. Gemini 4 was the first to be guided from Houston, with Mercury Control as a backup. From Gemini 5 through today, all flights are controlled from Houston.&lt;/ref&gt;

The astronaut corps that supported Project Gemini included the "[[Mercury Seven]]", "[[NASA Astronaut Group 2|The New Nine]]", and the [[NASA Astronaut Group 3|1963 astronaut class]]. During the program, three astronauts died in air crashes during training, including the prime crew for Gemini 9. This mission was flown by the backup crew, the only time that has happened in NASA's history to date.

Gemini was robust enough that the United States Air Force planned to use it for the [[Manned Orbital Laboratory]] (MOL) program, which was later canceled. Gemini's chief designer, [[Jim Chamberlin]], also made detailed plans for [[Outer space#Cislunar space|cislunar]] and lunar landing missions in late 1961. He believed that Gemini spacecraft could fly in lunar operations before Project Apollo, and cost less. NASA's administration did not approve those plans. In 1969, McDonnell-Douglas proposed a "[[Big Gemini]]" that could have been used to shuttle up to 12 astronauts to the planned space stations in the [[Apollo Applications Project]] (AAP). The only AAP project funded was [[Skylab]] – which used existing spacecraft and hardware – thereby eliminating the need for Big Gemini.

==Pronunciation==
The constellation for which the project was named is commonly pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|m|ɪ|n|aɪ}}, the last syllable rhyming with ''eye''. However, staff of the Manned Spacecraft Center, including the astronauts, tended to pronounce the name {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|m|ᵻ|n|iː}}, rhyming with ''knee''. NASA's public affairs office issued a statement in 1965 declaring "Jeh-mih-nee" to be the "official" pronunciation.&lt;ref name="NYTFirstMan"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schwartz |first1=John |title=Why Does ‘First Man’ Say Gemini as ‘Geminee’?

==Program origins and objectives==
The [[Apollo program]] was conceived in early 1960 as a three-man spacecraft to follow [[Project Mercury]]. [[Jim Chamberlin]], the head of engineering at the [[Space Task Group]] (STG), was assigned in February 1961 to start working on a bridge program between Mercury and Apollo.{{sfnp|Gainor|2001|pages=93, 97–99}} He presented two initial versions of a two-man spacecraft, then designated Mercury Mark II, at a NASA retreat at Wallops Island in March 1961.{{sfnp|Gainor|2001|pages=93, 97–99}} Scale models were shown in July 1961 at the [[McDonnell Aircraft|McDonnell Aircraft Corporation]]'s offices in St. Louis.{{sfnp|Gainor|2001|pages=93, 97–99}}

After Apollo was chartered to land men on the Moon by [[President John F. Kennedy]] on May 25, 1961, it became evident to NASA officials that a follow-on to the Mercury program was required to develop certain spaceflight capabilities in support of Apollo.  NASA approved the two-man program rechristened Project Gemini (Latin for "twins"), in reference to [[Gemini (constellation)|the third constellation of the Zodiac]] with its twin stars [[Castor (star)|Castor]] and [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]], on December 7, 1961.{{sfnp|Gainor|2001|pages=93, 97–99}} McDonnell Aircraft was contracted to build it on December 22, 1961.{{sfnp|Hacker|Grimwood|1977|pages= XV, 75}} The program was publicly announced on January 3, 1962, with these major objectives:{{sfnp|Loff|2013}}
* To demonstrate endurance of humans and equipment in spaceflight for extended periods, at least eight days required for a Moon landing, to a maximum of two weeks
* To effect [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] and [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|docking]] with another vehicle, and to maneuver the combined spacecraft using the propulsion system of the target vehicle
* To demonstrate [[Extra-vehicular activity|Extra-Vehicular Activity]] (EVA), or space-"walks" outside the protection of the spacecraft, and to evaluate the astronauts' ability to perform tasks there
* To perfect techniques of atmospheric reentry and touchdown at a pre-selected location on land&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The requirement for a touchdown on land using a paraglider was canceled in 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Team==
The Canadian Jim Chamberlin designed the Gemini capsule, which carried a crew of two. He was previously the chief [[aerodynamicist]] on [[Avro Canada]]'s [[Avro Arrow]] fighter interceptor program.{{sfnp|Murray|Cox|1989|pages=33–34}} Chamberlin joined NASA along with 25 senior Avro engineers after cancellation of the Arrow program, and became head of the U.S. Space Task Group's engineering division in charge of Gemini.{{sfnp|Murray|Cox|1989|pages=33–34}}{{sfnp|Reguly|1965|page=7}} The prime contractor was McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, which was also the prime contractor for the [[Project Mercury]] capsule.{{sfnp|Hacker|Grimwood|1977|page=75}}

[[Astronaut]] [[Gus Grissom]] was heavily involved in the development and design of the [[Gemini spacecraft]] (the other Mercury astronauts dubbed the Gemini spacecraft the "Gusmobile").{{sfnp|Agle|1998}} Grissom wrote in his posthumous 1968 book ''Gemini!'' that the realization of [[Project Mercury]]'s end and the unlikelihood of his having another flight in that program prompted him to focus all of his efforts on the upcoming Gemini program.

The Gemini program was managed by the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]], located in [[Houston, Texas]], under direction of the Office of Manned Space Flight, [[NASA]] Headquarters, Washington, D.C. Dr. [[George E. Mueller]], Associate Administrator of NASA for Manned Space Flight, served as acting director of the Gemini program. William C. Schneider, Deputy Director of Manned Space Flight for Mission Operations, served as mission director on all Gemini flights beginning with Gemini 6A.

[[Guenter Wendt]] was a McDonnell engineer who supervised launch preparations for both the Mercury and Gemini programs and would go on to do the same when the Apollo program launched crews. His team was responsible for completion of the complex pad close-out procedures just prior to spacecraft launch, and he was the last person the astronauts would see prior to closing the hatch. The astronauts appreciated his taking absolute authority over, and responsibility for, the condition of the spacecraft and developed a good-humored rapport with him.{{sfnp|Farmer|Hamblin|2004|pages=51–54}}

==Spacecraft==
[[File:Gemini spacecraft.jpg|thumb|left|A cutaway illustration of the Gemini spacecraft]]
NASA selected [[McDonnell Aircraft]], which had been the prime contractor for the [[Project Mercury]] capsule, in 1961 to build the Gemini capsule, the first of which was delivered in 1963. The spacecraft was {{convert|18|ft|5|in|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|10|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, with a launch weight varying from {{convert|7100|to|8350|lb|kg}}.{{sfnp|Gatland|1976|page=42}}

The Gemini crew capsule (referred to as the Reentry Module) was essentially an enlarged version of the Mercury capsule. Unlike Mercury, the [[retrorocket]]s, electrical power, propulsion systems, oxygen, and water were located in a detachable Adapter Module behind the Reentry Module. A major design improvement in Gemini was to locate all internal spacecraft systems in modular components, which could be independently tested and replaced when necessary, without removing or disturbing other already tested components.

===Reentry module===
Many components in the capsule itself were reachable through their own small access doors. Unlike Mercury, Gemini used completely solid-state electronics, and its modular design made it easy to repair.{{sfnp|Dryden|1964|page=362}}

Gemini's emergency [[launch escape system]] did not use an escape tower powered by a [[solid-fuel rocket]], but instead used aircraft-style [[ejection seat]]s. The tower was heavy and complicated, and NASA engineers reasoned that they could do away with it as the Titan II's [[hypergolic propellant]]s would burn immediately on contact. A Titan II booster explosion had a smaller blast effect and flame than on the cryogenically fueled Atlas and Saturn. [[Ejection seat]]s were sufficient to separate the astronauts from a malfunctioning launch vehicle. At higher altitudes, where the ejection seats could not be used, the astronauts would return inside the spacecraft, which would separate from the launch vehicle.{{sfnp|Dryden|1965|page=364}}

The main proponent of using ejection seats was [[Jim Chamberlin|James Chamberlin]], head of the engineering division of NASA's Space Force Task Group. Chamberlin had never liked the Mercury escape tower and wished to use a simpler alternative that would also reduce weight. He reviewed several films of Atlas and Titan II ICBM failures, which he used to estimate the approximate size of a fireball produced by an exploding launch vehicle and from this he gauged that the Titan II would produce a much smaller explosion, thus the spacecraft could get away with ejection seats.

[[Maxime Faget]], the designer of the Mercury LES, was on the other hand less-than-enthusiastic about this setup. Aside from the possibility of the ejection seats seriously injuring the astronauts, they would also only be usable for about 40 seconds after liftoff, by which point the booster would be attaining Mach 1 speed and ejection would no longer be possible. He was also concerned about the astronauts being launched through the Titan's exhaust plume if they ejected in-flight and later added that "The best thing about Gemini was that they never had to make an escape."&lt;ref&gt;Glen E. Swanson, ed., "Before This Decade Is Out: Personal Reflections on the Apollo Program," Dover Publications 2012, p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gemini was the first astronaut-carrying spacecraft to include an onboard computer, the [[Gemini Guidance Computer]], to facilitate management and control of mission maneuvers. This computer, sometimes called the Gemini Spacecraft On-Board Computer (OBC), was very similar to the [[Saturn Launch Vehicle Digital Computer]]. The Gemini Guidance Computer weighed {{convert|58.98|lb}}. Its [[core memory]] had 4096 [[Memory address|addresses]], each containing a 39-bit [[Word (computer architecture)|word]] composed of three 13-bit "syllables". All numeric data was [[26-bit]] [[two's-complement]] integers (sometimes used as [[fixed-point number]]s), either stored in the first two syllables of a word or in the [[Accumulator (computing)|accumulator]]. [[Instruction set|Instructions]] (always with a 4-bit [[opcode]] and 9 bits of operand) could go in any syllable.{{sfnp|Tomayko|1988|pages=10–19}}{{sfnp|Burkey|2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/space/space_gemini.html|title=IBM Archives: IBM and the Gemini Program|date=23 January 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Leist and J. C. Condell, [http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/gemini_manual_rev_a_9-30-11.pdf "Gemini Programming Manual"], 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Mercury, the Gemini used in-flight [[radar]] and an [[Attitude indicator|artificial horizon]]—devices similar to those used in the aviation industry.{{sfnp|Tomayko|1988|pages=10–19}}

[[File:Gemini paraglider.JPG|thumb|Gemini paraglider during tests at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in August 1964.]]
The original intention for Gemini was to land on solid ground instead of at sea, using a [[Rogallo wing]] rather than a parachute, with the crew seated upright controlling the forward motion of the craft. To facilitate this, the airfoil did not attach just to the nose of the craft, but to an additional attachment point for balance near the heat shield. This cord was covered by a strip of metal which ran between the twin hatches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Vintage Space|url=https://vintagespace.wordpress.com/2011/05/22/losing-rogallo-from-gemini/ |title=Losing Rogallo from Gemini |publisher=Amy Shira Teitel |date=2011-05-22 |accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design was ultimately dropped, and parachutes were used to make a sea landing as in Mercury. The capsule was suspended at an angle closer to horizontal, so that a side of the heat shield contacted the water first. This eliminated the need for the landing bag cushion used in the Mercury capsule.

===Adapter module===
The adapter module in turn was separated into a Retro module and an Equipment module.

====Retro module====
The Retro module contained four solid-fuel TE-M-385 Star-13E retrorockets, each spherical in shape except for its rocket nozzle, which were structurally attached to two beams that reached across the diameter of the retro module, crossing at right angles in the center.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spaceaholic.com/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/15&lt;/ref&gt; Re-entry began with the retrorockets firing one at a time. Abort procedures at certain periods during lift-off would cause them to fire at the same time, thrusting the Descent module away from the Titan rocket.

====Equipment module====
Gemini was equipped with an [[Orbit attitude and maneuvering system|Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System]] (OAMS), containing sixteen thrusters for [[translation (geometry)|translation]] control in all three perpendicular axes (forward/backward, left/right, up/down), in addition to [[attitude control]] (pitch, yaw, and roll angle orientation) as in Mercury. Translation control allowed changing [[orbital inclination]] and altitude, necessary to perform [[space rendezvous]] with other craft, and [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|docking]] with the [[Agena target vehicle|Agena Target Vehicle]] (ATV), with its own rocket engine which could be used to perform greater orbit changes.

Early short-duration missions had their electrical power supplied by batteries; later endurance missions used the first [[fuel cell]]s in manned spacecraft.

Gemini was in some regards more advanced than Apollo because the latter program began almost a year earlier. It became known as a "pilot's spacecraft" due to its assortment of jet fighter-like features, in no small part due to Gus Grissom's influence over the design, and it was at this point where the American manned space program clearly began showing its superiority over that of the Soviet Union with long duration flight, rendezvous, and extravehicular capability.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;During the ten manned flights of the Gemini program, the Soviets made no manned flights, and despite achieving the first EVA, did no more EVAs until January 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union during this period was developing the [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] spacecraft intended to take cosmonauts to the Moon, but political and technical problems began to get in the way, leading to the ultimate end of their manned lunar program.

==Launch vehicle==
{{Main|Titan II GLV}}
The [[Titan II]] had debuted in 1962 as the Air Force's second-generation ICBM to replace the Atlas. By using hypergolic fuels, it could be stored for long periods of time and be easily readied for launch in addition to being a simpler design with fewer components, the only caveat being that the propellant mix ([[nitrogen tetroxide]] and [[hydrazine]]) was extremely toxic compared to the Atlas's liquid oxygen/RP-1. However, the Titan had considerable difficulty being man-rated due to early problems with [[pogo oscillation]]. The launch vehicle used a radio guidance system that was unique to launches from Cape Kennedy.

==Astronauts==
[[File:Astronauts White and McDivitt Inside Gemini IV Spacecraft - GPN-2002-000031.jpg|thumb|Astronauts White and McDivitt inside the Gemini 4 spacecraft, 1965]]
[[File:Gemini8.1966.ws.jpg|thumb|Gemini 8 prime crew and other astronauts at prelaunch breakfast, 1966]]
[[Deke Slayton]], as director of flight crew operations, had primary responsibility for assigning crews for the Gemini program. Each flight had a primary crew and backup crew, and the backup crew would rotate to primary crew status three flights later. Slayton intended for first choice of mission commands to be given to the four remaining active astronauts of the [[Mercury Seven]]: [[Alan Shepard]], Grissom, Cooper, and Schirra. ([[John Glenn]] had retired from NASA in January 1964 and [[Scott Carpenter]], who was blamed by some in NASA management for the problematic reentry of ''[[Mercury-Atlas 7|Aurora 7]]'', was on leave to participate in the Navy's [[SEALAB (United States Navy)|SEALAB]] project and was grounded from flight in July 1964 due to an arm injury sustained in a motorbike accident. Slayton himself continued to be grounded due to a heart problem.)

Titles used for the left-hand (command) and right-hand seat crew positions were taken from the [[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating|U.S. Air Force pilot ratings]], ''Command Pilot'' and ''Pilot''. Sixteen astronauts flew on 10 manned Gemini missions:

===Crew selection===
In late 1963, Slayton selected Shepard and Stafford for Gemini 3, McDivitt and White for Gemini 4, and Schirra and Young for Gemini 5 (which was to be the first Agena rendezvous mission). The backup crew for Gemini 3 was Grissom and Borman, who were also slated for [[Gemini 6]], to be the first long-duration mission. Finally Conrad and Lovell were assigned as the backup crew for [[Gemini 4]].

Delays in the production of the Agena Target Vehicle caused the first rearrangement of the crew rotation. The Schirra and Young mission was bumped to Gemini 6 and they became the backup crew for Shepard and Stafford. Grissom and Borman then had their long-duration mission assigned to Gemini 5.

The second rearrangement occurred when Shepard developed [[Ménière's disease]], an inner ear problem. Grissom was then moved to command Gemini 3. Slayton felt that Young was a better personality match with Grissom and switched Stafford and Young. Finally, Slayton tapped Cooper to command the long-duration Gemini 5. Again for reasons of compatibility, he moved Conrad from backup commander of Gemini 4 to pilot of Gemini 5, and Borman to backup command of Gemini 4. Finally he assigned Armstrong and [[Elliot See]] to be the backup crew for Gemini 5.
The third rearrangement of crew assignment occurred when Slayton felt that See wasn't up to the physical demands of EVA on Gemini 8. He reassigned See to be the prime commander of Gemini 9 and put Scott as pilot of Gemini 8 and [[Charles Bassett]] as the pilot of Gemini 9.

The fourth and final rearrangement of the Gemini crew assignment occurred after the deaths of See and Bassett when their trainer jet crashed, coincidentally into a McDonnell building which held their Gemini 9 capsule in St. Louis. The backup crew of Stafford and Cernan was then moved up to the new prime crew of the re-designated Gemini 9A. Lovell and Aldrin were moved from being the backup crew of Gemini 10 to be the backup crew of Gemini 9. This cleared the way through the crew rotation for Lovell and Aldrin to become the prime crew of Gemini 12.

Along with the deaths of Grissom, White, and [[Roger Chaffee]] in the fire of [[Apollo 1]], this final arrangement helped determine the makeup of the first seven Apollo crews, and who would be in position for a chance to be the first to walk on the Moon.

==Missions==
[[File:Gemini 5 control room.jpg|thumb|right|Gemini Mission Control in Houston during Gemini 5]]
In 1964 and 1965 two Gemini missions were flown without crews to test out systems and the heat shield. These were followed by ten flights with crews in 1965 and 1966. All were launched by Titan II launch vehicles. Some highlights from the Gemini program:
* [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] became the first American to make an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA, or "space walk"), on June 3, 1965, during [[Gemini 4]].
* [[Gemini 5]] demonstrated the 8-day endurance necessary for an Apollo lunar mission with the first use of [[fuel cell]]s to generate its electrical power.
* [[Gemini 6A]] and [[Gemini 7|7]] accomplished the first [[space rendezvous]] in December 1965, and Gemini 7 set a 14-day endurance record.
* [[Gemini 8]] achieved the first [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|space docking]] with an unmanned Agena Target Vehicle.
* [[Gemini 11]] set a manned Earth orbital altitude record of {{convert|739.2|nmi|km}} in September 1966, using the propulsion system of its Agena target vehicle. This record still stands as of 2017.&lt;ref name="Dumoulin"&gt;{{Citation

* [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin]] on [[Gemini 12]] became the first space traveller to prove that useful work could be done outside a spacecraft without life-threatening exhaustion.

Rendezvous in orbit is not a straightforward maneuver. Should a spacecraft increase its speed to catch up with another, the result is that it goes into a higher and slower orbit and the distance thereby increases. The right procedure is to slow down and go to a lower orbit first, and then later to increase speed and go to the same orbit as the other.&lt;ref name="rendezAldrin"&gt;{{cite web|author=Buzz Aldrin|publisher=Buzz Aldrin's Share Space Foundation|url= http://buzzaldrin.com/space-vision/rocket_science/orbital-rendezvous/|title=Orbital Rendezvous|date= Fall 2005|accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; To practice these maneuvers special rendezvous and docking simulators were built for the astronauts.&lt;ref name="rendezSim"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=NASA |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4002/p1b.htm  |title=NASA, Project Gemini|accessdate=2011-10-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041107093750/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4002/p1b.htm|archivedate=2004-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Titan II GLV|Gemini-Titan II]] launch vehicle was adapted by NASA from the U.S. Air Force [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II ICBM]]. (Similarly, the [[Atlas LV-3B|Mercury-Atlas]] launch vehicle had been adapted from the USAF [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas missile]].) The Gemini-Titan II rockets were assigned Air Force serial numbers, which were painted in four places on each Titan II (on opposite sides on each of the first and second stages). USAF crews maintained Launch Complex 19 and prepared and launched all of the Gemini-Titan II launch vehicles. Data and experience operating the Titans was of value to both the U.S. Air Force and NASA.

The USAF serial numbers assigned to the Gemini-Titan launch vehicles are given in the tables above. Fifteen Titan IIs were ordered in 1962 so the serial is "62-12XXX", but only "12XXX" is painted on the Titan II. The order for the last three of the 15 launch vehicles was canceled on July 30, 1964, and they were never built. Serial numbers were, however, assigned to them prospectively: ''12568'' - GLV-13; ''12569'' - GLV-14; and ''12570'' - GLV-15.

==Program cost==
From 1962 to 1967, Gemini cost $1.3 billion in 1967 dollars (${{format price|{{Inflation|US-GDP|1300000000|1967|r=2}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}).&lt;ref name="lafleur20100308"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1579/1 | title=Costs of US piloted programs | work=The Space Review | date=2010-03-08 | accessdate=February 18, 2012 | author=Lafleur, Claude}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1969, a NASA report to the US Congress estimating the costs for Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo (through the first manned Moon landing) included $1.2834 billion for Gemini: $797.4 million for spacecraft, $409.8 million for launch vehicles, and $76.2 million for support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Proposed extensions and applications==

===Advanced Gemini===
{{main|Advanced Gemini}}
McDonnell Aircraft, the main contractor for Mercury and Gemini, was also one of the original bidders on the prime contract for Apollo, but lost out to [[North American Aviation]]. McDonnell later sought to extend the Gemini program by proposing a derivative which could be used to fly a [[outer space|cislunar]] mission and even achieve a manned lunar landing earlier and at less cost than Apollo, but these proposals were rejected by NASA.

A range of applications were considered for Advanced Gemini missions, including military flights, space station crew and logistics delivery, and lunar flights. The Lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems developed for the Agena Target Vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the Centaur, which could propel the spacecraft to the Moon, to complete modifications of the Gemini to enable it to land on the lunar surface. Its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before Apollo was ready, to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded Apollo crews, or even replacing the Apollo program.

Some of the Advanced Gemini proposals used "off-the-shelf" Gemini spacecraft, unmodified from the original program, while others featured modifications to allow the spacecraft to carry more crew, dock with space stations, visit the Moon, and perform other mission objectives. Other modifications considered included the addition of wings or a parasail to the spacecraft, in order to enable it to make a horizontal landing.

===Big Gemini===
{{Main|Big Gemini}}
Big Gemini (or "Big G") was another proposal by McDonnell Douglas made in August 1969. It was intended to provide large-capacity, all-purpose access to space, including missions that ultimately used Apollo or the Space Shuttle.

The study was performed to generate a preliminary definition of a logistic spacecraft derived from Gemini that would be used to resupply an orbiting space station. Land-landing at a preselected site and refurbishment and reuse were design requirements. Two baseline spacecraft were defined: a nine-man minimum modification version of the Gemini B called Min-Mod Big G and a 12-man advanced concept, having the same exterior geometry but with new, state-of-the-art subsystems, called Advanced Big G. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Three launch vehicles-[[Saturn IB]], [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan IIIM]], and [[Saturn INT-20]] (S-IC/S-IVB) were investigated for use with the spacecraft.

===Military applications===
The Air Force had an interest in the Gemini system, and decided to use its own modification of the spacecraft as the crew vehicle for the [[Manned Orbital Laboratory]]. To this end, the Gemini 2 spacecraft was refurbished and flown again atop a mockup of the MOL, sent into space by a [[Titan III]]C. This was the first time a spacecraft went into space twice.

The USAF also had the notion of adapting the Gemini spacecraft for military applications, such as crude observation of the ground (no specialized reconnaissance camera could be carried) and practicing making rendezvous with suspicious satellites. This project was called [[Blue Gemini]]. The USAF did not like the fact that Gemini would have to be recovered by the US Navy, so they intended for Blue Gemini eventually to use the airfoil and land on three skids, carried over from the original design of Gemini.

At first some within NASA welcomed sharing of the cost with the USAF, but it was later agreed that NASA was better off operating Gemini by itself. Blue Gemini was canceled in 1963 by [[U.S. Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]], who decided that the NASA Gemini flights could conduct necessary military experiments. MOL was canceled by Secretary of Defense [[Melvin Laird]] in 1969, when it was determined that unmanned [[spy satellite]]s could perform the same functions much more cost-effectively.

==In media==
* Two Gemini capsules (codenamed "Jupiter") are featured in the plot of the 1967 [[James Bond in film|James Bond]] film ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]''.
* A modified one-man Gemini capsule is used to send an astronaut (played by ''[[James Caan]]'') to the moon in the 1968 film ''[[Countdown (1968 film)|Countdown]]''.

'''PubRef''' is a composition and project management application used by researchers and students for [[Academic publishing#Scholarly paper|scholarly writing]] and [[Scholarly communication|communication]].  PubRef uses an extended form of [[Markdown]]  as a primary authoring format and converts this to [[Journal Article Tag Suite|JATS]], the archive format used by the [[United States National Library of Medicine|US National Library of Medicine]].

==Research asset containerization==

Researchers manage scholarly writing projects within version-controlled file repositories called ''containers'' that function similarly to [[Repository (version control)|git repositories]] and [[Docker (software)|docker containers]] to provide enhanced [[reproducibility]], [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and [[Reusability|re-usability]] in digital science publishing.

==Manuscript writing==

A PubRef manuscript is a Markdown file within a ''container'' that contains extra embedded information that describes the essential front matter elements of a scholarly manuscript such as the [[Title (publishing)|title]], [http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/running-heads/ short title], [[Author|list of authors]], [http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/contribinfo/prep/prep_init.xhtml author affiliations], [[Index term|keywords]].  This information is captured in embedded [[YAML]] blocks within the primary manuscript called ''Meta''.  Figures, tables, equations and other special content can be similarly embedded within the context of the document via ''Meta'' descriptors.

==Minimal example==

This minimal formatting example repurposes a classic paper by Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose ''The Singularities of Gravitational Collapse and Cosmology'' &lt;ref name="Auto2J-7"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspa.1970.0021 |first=Stephen |last=Hawking |last2=Penrose |first2=Roger |year=1970 |title=The Singularities of Gravitational Collapse and Cosmology |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |volume=314 |issue=1519 |pages=529–548 |bibcode=1970RSPSA.314..529H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscript publishing==

Once the essential frontmatter meta elements have been declared, manuscripts can be automatically submitted to academic publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aries Press|title=Aries Systems and PubRef Announce Partnership Allowing Authors Direct Submission to Thousands of Scholarly Journals|url=http://www.editorialmanager.com/homepage/press.html#090815|website=Aries Systems Corporation|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles, supporting data, and dependent code can be published directly on PubRef in the form of ''personal communications'' under the DOI prefix ''10.17920/P9.pubref''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=California Digital Library|title=EZID Client List|url=http://ezid.cdlib.org/home/client_list|website=California Digital Library|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5798">'''Spagyric''' {{IPAc-en|s|p|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ɪr|ɪ|k}} is a word in English that means "[[alchemy]]." Some people have coined the use of the word to mean an [[herbalism|herbal medicine]] produced by [[alchemy|alchemical]] procedures. These procedures involve [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]], [[distillation]], and extraction of [[mineral]] components from the [[wood ash|ash]] of the [[plant]]. These processes were in use in [[medieval]] alchemy generally for the separation and purification of [[metal]]s from [[ore]]s (see [[Calcination]]), and [[salt]]s from [[brine]]s and other [[aqueous solution]]s.

==Etymology==
The word comes from [[Ancient Greek]] σπάω ''spao'' "to draw out" and ἀγείρω ''ageiro'' "to gather".&lt;ref&gt;John Craig, ''A New Universal Etymological, Technological and Pronouncing Dictionary of the English Language,'' Volume 2, London: G H Collins, 1849, p.730&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Reid, ''A Dictionary of the English Language,'' New York: D Appleton &amp; Co, 1845, p.383, p.476, p.516&lt;/ref&gt; It is a term probably first coined by [[Paracelsus]]. In its original use, the word ''spagyric'' was commonly used synonymously with the word ''alchemy'', however, in more recent times it has often been adopted by [[alternative medicine]] theorists and various techniques of [[holistic medicine]].

==In practice==
Spagyric most commonly refers to a plant [[tincture]] to which has also been added the ash of the [[calcination|calcined]] plant. The original rationale behind these special herbal tinctures seems to have been that an extract using [[alcohol]] could not be expected to contain all the medicinal properties from a living plant, and so the ash or mineral component (as a result of the calcination process) of the calcined plant was prepared separately and then added back to 'augment' (increase) the alcoholic tincture. The roots of the word therefore refer first to the extraction or separation process and then to the recombining process. These herbal tinctures are alleged to have superior medicinal properties to simple alcohol tinctures, perhaps due the formation of [[soap]]-like compounds from the [[essential oil]]s and the basic salts contained within the ash. In theory these spagyrics can also optionally include material from fermentation of the plant material and also any [[aroma]]tic component such as might be obtained through distillation. The final spagyric should be a re-blending of all such extracts into one 'essence'.

The concept of the spagyric remedy in turn relies upon the three cardinal principles of alchemy, termed as [[salt]], [[sulfur]], and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. "The basis of matter was the alchemical trinity of principles – salt, sulfur, and mercury. Salt was the principle of fixity (non-action) and in-combustibility; mercury was the principle of fusibility (ability to melt and flow) and volatility; and sulfur was the principle of inflammability."

The three primal alchemical properties and their correspondence in spagyric remedy are:
*Mercury = [[water (classical element)|water element]]s, representing the life essence of the plant, the very alcohol extract of the plant is the carrier of the life essence.
*Salt = [[earth (classical element)|earth element]], representing the vegetable salts extracted from calcined ashes of plant body.
*Sulfur = [[fire (classical element)|fire element]], virtue of plant, representing the volatile oil essence of the plant.

[[Paracelsus]] stated that the true purpose of [[alchemy]] was not for the vulgar purpose of gold making, but rather for the production of medicines.The term 'Spagyria' has been used by Paracelsus in his book ''Liber Paragranum'', deriving from the Greek words 'spao' and 'ageiro', the essential meaning of which is to 'separate and to combine'.

He formulated that nature in itself was 'raw and unfinished', and man had the God-given task to evolve things to a higher level. As an example: The 'raw' medicinal plant would be separated into the basic components he termed 'mercurius', 'sulfur', and 'sal' and thereby cleaned of non-essential components. 'Mercurius', 'sulfur', and 'sal' were then recombined forming the medicine.

In contemporary terms, this would be the extraction of the essential [[oil]]s with [[vapour]] gaining the 'sulfur'. Then fermentation of the remaining plant and distilling the alcohol produced thus gaining 'mercurius'. Extraction of the mineral components from the ash of the marc&lt;sup&gt;[?]&lt;/sup&gt; which would be the 'sal'. Diluting the essential oils in the alcohol and then dissolving the mineral salts in it would produce the final potion. (This is a simplified representation of the process which varies strongly depending on the source chosen.)

[[Joseph Needham]] devoted several volumes of his monumental ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'' to ''Spagyrical discovery and invention''. In 1965, [[Malaclypse the Younger]] and [[Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst]] popularized the term as a result of their joint seminal work [[Principia Discordia]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The word ''spagyrici'' is inscribed on the coffin-plate of the English Paracelsian physician [[Sir Thomas Browne]] (1605-82).

'''''The Poisoner's Handbook: Murder and the Birth of Forensic Medicine in Jazz Age New York''''' is a ''New York Times'' best-selling non-fiction book by [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning science writer [[Deborah Blum]] that was released by [[Penguin Press]] in 2010.

==Synopsis==
In 1918, [[New York City]] appointed [[Charles Norris (medical examiner)|Charles Norris]], [[Bellevue Hospital]]'s chief pathologist, as its first scientifically trained [[medical examiner]]. The book, about Norris and [[Alexander Gettler]], the city's first toxicologist, describes the [[Jazz Age]]'s poisoning cases. Before the two began working in the medical examiner's office, Blum pointed out in her book, poisoners could get away with murder. The book covers the years from 1915 to 1936, which Blum described as a "coming-of-age" for [[forensic toxicology]]. "Under (Norris's) direction, the New York City medical examiner's office would become a department that set forensic standards for the rest of the country," Blum wrote.

While a guest on [[National Public Radio]]’s "Talk of the Nation/Science Friday" to discuss the book, Blum told host [[Ira Flatow]] that she wrote the book because, "I've always been interested in poison. I wanted to write about the mystery of how (poisons) kill us.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crime-and-justice-news.newslib.com/story/8214-102004/ |title=NPR transcript, "Science And Crime Mix In 'The Poisoner’s Handbook," May 30, 2010 |publisher=Crime-and-justice-news.newslib.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

''[[Reader's Digest]]'' named ''The Poisoner's Handbook'' one of its Top 10 best crime books, saying, "This is science writing at its finest that reads like a mystery novel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rd.com/culture/best-true-crime-books/|title=Best True Crime Books to Add to Your List - Reader's Digest|author=|date=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' placed the book on its Top-rated List on March 5, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/books/review/EdChoice-t.html?_r=0 |title=Editors’ Choice |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=March 5, 2010 |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its Sunday book review, the ''Times'' said ''The Poisoner's Handbook'' was "structured like a collection of linked short stories. Each chapter centers on a mysterious death by poison that Norris and Gettler investigate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/books/review/East-t.html |title=Murder by the Drop |publisher=NYTimes.com |date= February 25, 2010 |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was listed as a ''[[New York Times bestseller]]'' in paperback nonfiction in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor |first=Ihsan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2011-02-27/paperback-nonfiction/list.html |title=Best Sellers - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Amazon named ''The Poisoner's Handbook'' in its Top 100 Best of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/non-fiction-reading-list/lm/RWWWAWL82DEQH |title=non fiction reading list |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Not only is ''The Poisoner's Handbook'' as thrilling as any 'CSI' episode," wrote reviewer Art Taylor with ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "but it also offers something even better: an education in how forensics really works."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor |first=Art |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2010-02-21/news/36825093_1_cyanide-case-first-chief-medical-examiner-forensic-medicine |title=The science of murder - Washington Post |publisher=Articles.washingtonpost.com |date=2010-02-21 |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' described the book as, "The rollicking story of the creation of modern forensic science by New York researchers during the Prohibition era."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meador |first=Clifton K |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/deborah-blum/the-poisoners-handbook/ |title=THE POISONER’S HANDBOOK by Deborah Blum &amp;#124; Kirkus |publisher=Kirkusreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnes and Noble's editor's review said this: "The book is an unexpected yet appropriate open-sesame into a world that was planting seeds for the world -- with lethal toxins and cutting-edge tools -- that would later, darkly bloom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hales |first=Dianne R. |url=http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/The-Criminalist/The-Poisoner-s-Handbook/ba-p/2175 |title=The Poisoner's Handbook - The Barnes &amp; Noble Review |publisher=Bnreview.barnesandnoble.com |date=2010-02-15 |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glen Weldon from NPR Books said:  "Rigorously researched and thoroughly engaging, ''The Poisoner's Handbook'' is a compelling, comprehensive portrait of the time and place that transformed criminal investigation, and made it much more difficult for that most insidious of murderers to escape the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124472649|title='The Poisoner's Handbook': CSI's Jazz Age Roots|author=|date=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentary==
[[PBS]] optioned the book for TV and produced it as an episode of ''[[American Experience]]''. It premiered on January 7, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pbsinternational.org/index.php?sid=b8wsnj14koqsfddiugktr3m7ewonrjhs&amp;lang=english&amp;page=programs&amp;pgid=1&amp;dle_pp=0&amp;dle_od=asc&amp;pr_act=details&amp;pid=987 |title=The Poisoner's Handbook - American Experience - WGBH |publisher=Corporation for Public Broadcasting |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hubble ultra deep field high rez edit1.jpg|thumb|UDF 423 is the [[spiral galaxy]] in the lower right quadrant of the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]].]]

'''UDF 423''' is the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]] (UDF) identifier for a distant [[spiral galaxy]].  With an [[apparent magnitude]] of 20,&lt;ref name=Wikisky/&gt; UDF 423 is one of the brightest galaxies in the HUDF and also has one of the largest [[Angular diameter|apparent sizes]] in the HUDF.&lt;ref name=Wikisky/&gt;

==Distance measurements==
The "distance" of a far away galaxy depends on [[Distance measures (cosmology)|how it is measured]].  With a [[redshift]] of 1,&lt;ref name=Malhotra/&gt; light from this galaxy is estimated to have taken around 7.7 [[Giga-|billion]] years to reach Earth.&lt;ref name="Calculator"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cosmology Calculator I |publisher=Astronomy @ UCLA |author=Edward L. (Ned) Wright |url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, since this galaxy is receding from Earth, the present [[comoving distance]] is estimated to be around 10 billion [[light-year]]s away.&lt;ref name="Calculator"/&gt;  In context, Hubble is observing this galaxy as it appeared when the Universe was around 5.9 billion years old.&lt;ref name="Calculator"/&gt;

The '''Vostok''' ({{lang-ru|Восток}}, translated as "East") was a type of [[spacecraft]] built by the [[Soviet Union]]. The first [[human spaceflight]] was accomplished with [[Vostok 1]] on [[Cosmonautics Day|April 12, 1961]], by Soviet [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]].

The spacecraft was part of the [[Vostok programme]], in which six manned spaceflights were made, from 1961–63. Two further manned space flights were made in 1964 and 1965 by [[Voskhod (spacecraft)|Voskhod spacecraft]], which were modified ''Vostok'' spacecraft. By the late 1960s both were superseded by the [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]], which are still used {{as of|2018|lc=y}}.

==Development==
The Vostok spacecraft was originally designed for use both as a camera platform (for the Soviet Union's first spy satellite program, [[Zenit spy satellite|Zenit]]) and as a manned spacecraft. This [[dual-use]] design was crucial in gaining [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] support for the program. The basic Vostok design has remained in use for some 40 years, gradually adapted for a range of other unmanned [[satellite]]s. The descent module design was reused, in heavily modified form, by the [[Voskhod program]].

==Design==
The craft consisted of a spherical descent module (mass 2.46 tonnes, diameter 2.3 meters), which housed the [[cosmonaut]], instruments and escape system, and a conical instrument module (mass 2.27 tonnes, 2.25 m long, 2.43 m wide), which contained propellant and the engine system. On reentry, the cosmonaut would eject from the craft at about 7,000 m (23,000&amp;nbsp;ft) and descend via parachute, while the capsule would land separately. The reason for this was that the Vostok descent module made an extremely rough landing that could have left a cosmonaut seriously injured.

The ejector seat also served as an escape mechanism in the event of a launch vehicle failure, which at this early phase of the space program was a common occurrence. If an accident occurred in the first 40 seconds after liftoff, the cosmonaut would simply eject from the spacecraft and parachute to Earth. From 40 to 150 seconds into launch, ground controllers could issue a manual shutdown command to the booster. When the launch vehicle fell to a low enough altitude, the cosmonaut would eject. Higher altitude failures after shroud jettison would involve detaching the entire spacecraft from the booster.

One problem that was never adequately resolved was the event of a launch vehicle malfunction in the first 20 seconds, when the ejector seat would not have enough time to deploy its parachute. LC-1 at the Baikonour Cosmodrome had netting placed around it to catch the descent module should the cosmonaut eject while still on the pad, but it was of doubtful value since he would likely end up landing too close to the exploding booster. An accident in the initial seconds of launch also likely would have not put the cosmonaut in a position where he could make a survivable ejection and in all probability, this situation would have resulted in his death. A 2001 recollection by V.V. Molodsov stated that Chief Designer [[Sergei Korolev]] felt "absolutely terrible" about the inadequate provisions for crew escape on the Vostok during the opening seconds of launch.

There were several models of the Vostok leading up to the manned version:

===Vostok 1K===
Prototype spacecraft.

===Vostok 2K===
Photo-reconnaissance and signals intelligence spacecraft. Later named [[Zenit spy satellite]].

===Vostok 3KA===
[[File:Vostok Spacecraft Diagram.svg|thumb|Vostok spacecraft]] 
The Vostok 3KA was the spacecraft used for the first [[human spaceflight]]s. They were launched from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] using [[Vostok 8K72K]] launch vehicles. The first flight of a Vostok 3KA occurred on March 9, 1961. The first flight with a crew—[[Vostok 1]] carrying [[Yuri Gagarin]]—took place on April 12, 1961. The last flight—[[Vostok 6]] carrying the first woman in space, [[Valentina Tereshkova]]—took place on June 16, 1963.

A total of 8 Vostok 3KA spacecraft were flown, 6 of them with a human crew.

==Reentry==
The Vostok capsule had limited thruster capability. As such, the reentry path and orientation could not be controlled after the capsule had separated from the engine system. This meant that the capsule had to be protected from reentry heat on all sides, thus explaining the spherical design (as opposed to [[Project Mercury]]'s conical design, which allowed for maximum volume while minimizing the heat shield diameter). Some control of the capsule reentry orientation was possible by way of positioning of the heavy equipment to offset the vehicle center of gravity, which also maximized the chance of the [[cosmonaut]] surviving [[g-force]]s while in a horizontal position. Even then, the cosmonaut experienced 8 to 9g.

If the [[retrorocket]] failed, the spacecraft would naturally decay from orbit within ten days, and the cosmonaut was provided with enough food and oxygen to survive until that time.

'''WISE J071322.55−291751.9''' (designation abbreviated to '''WISE 0713−2917''') is a [[brown dwarf]] of [[spectral class]] Y0,{{r|Kirkpatrick2012}} located in constellation [[Canis Major]] at approximately 23 [[light-year]]s from [[Earth]].{{r|Kirkpatrick2012}}

==Discovery==
'''WISE 0713−2917''' was discovered in 2012 by [[J. Davy Kirkpatrick]] and colleagues from data collected by the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE) in the infrared at a wavelength of 40&amp;nbsp;cm (16&amp;nbsp;in), whose mission lasted from December 2009 to February 2011. In 2012 Kirkpatrick et al. published a paper in [[The Astrophysical Journal]], where they presented discovery of seven new found by WISE [[brown dwarf]]s of [[spectral type]] Y, among which also was WISE 0713−2917.{{r|Kirkpatrick2012}}

==Distance==
[[Trigonometric parallax]] of WISE 0713−2917 is not yet measured. Therefore, there are only distance estimates of this object, obtained by indirect—spectrophotometric—means (see table).
