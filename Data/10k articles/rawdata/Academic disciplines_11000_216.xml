      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5525">'''1q21.1 copy number variations (CNVs)'''&lt;ref name="Copy Number Variant 2011"&gt;Understanding the impact of 1q21.1 Copy Number Variant; C. Harvard et al; Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2011, 6:54; {{doi|10.1186/1750-1172-6-54}}&lt;/ref&gt; are rare aberrations of human [[chromosome 1]].

In a common situation a human cell has one pair of identical chromosomes on chromosome 1. With the 1q21.1 CNVs one chromosome of the pair is not complete because a part of the sequence of the chromosome is missing, or overcomplete, because some parts of the sequence are duplicated. The result is that one chromosome is of normal length and the other one is too long or too short.

[[File:Chromosome 1 to 1q21.1.jpg|thumb|right|500px|The structure of 1q21.1]]

==The structure of 1q21.1==
The structure of 1q21.1 is complex. The area has a size of approximately 6 Mega[[Base pair|base]] (Mb) (from 141.5 Mb to 147.9 Mb). Within 1q21.1 there are two areas where the CNVs can be found: the proximal area or TAR area (144.1 to 144.5) and the distal area (144.7 to 145.9). A 1q21.1 CNV will commonly be found in one of these areas, but an overlap with the other area or parts that are outside these areas are possible. 1q21.1 has multiple repetitions of the same structure (areas with the same color in the picture have equal structures) Only 25% of the structure is not duplicated. There are several gaps in the sequence. There is no further information available about the DNA-sequence in those areas up till now. The gaps represent approximately 700 Kilobase. New genes are expected in the gaps. The area of 1q21.1 is one of the most difficult parts of the human genome to map.

CNVs occur due to [[non-allelic homologous recombination]] mediated by [[low copy repeats]] (sequentially similar regions).

== Forms of 1q21.1 CNVs ==
Four separate forms of 1q21.1 CNVs are mentioned in literature.

* the [[1q21.1 proximal deletions and duplications]]
* the [[TAR syndrome]]
* the distal deletion, known as the [[1q21.1 deletion syndrome]]
* the distal duplication, known as the [[1q21.1 duplication syndrome]]

The CNVs lead to a very variable [[phenotype]] and the manifestations in individuals are quite variable. Some people who have a CNV can function in a normal way, while others have symptoms of mental retardation and various physical anomalies.

==Cause of the syndrome==
[[Meiosis]] is the process of dividing cells in humans. In meiosis, the chromosome pairs splits and a representative of each pair goes to one daughter cell. In this way the number of chromosomes will be halved in each cell, while all the parts on the chromosome (genes) remain, after being randomized. Which information of the parent cell ends up in the daughter cell is purely decided by chance. Besides this random process, there is a second random process. In this second random process the DNA will be scrambled in a way that pieces are omitted ([[deletion (genetics)|deletion]]), added ([[Gene duplication|duplication]]), moved from one place to another ([[chromosomal translocation|translocation]]) and inverted ([[chromosomal inversion|inversion]]). This is a common process, which leads to about 0,4% variation in the DNA. It explains why even identical twins are not genetically 100% identical.

Problem of the second random process is that genetic mistakes can occur. Especially due to the deletion and duplication process, the chromosomes that come together in a new cell may be shorter or longer. The result of this spontaneous change in the structure of DNA is a so-called [[copy number variation]]. Due to the CNV chromosomes of different sizes can be combined in a new cell. If this occurs around conception, the result will be a first cell of a human with a genetic variation. This can be either positive or negative. In positive cases this new human will be capable of a special skill that is assessed positively, for example, in sports or science. In negative cases, you have to deal with a syndrome or a severe disability, as in this case the 1q21.1 CNVs.

Based on the meiotic process, the syndrome may occur in two ways.
*1. a spontaneous deviation (a 'de novo' situation): two chromosomes come together of which one has a copy number variation as a result of the meiosis process.
*2. a parent is unknowingly carrier of a chromosome with a copy number variation and passes it through at conception to the child, with different consequences for the child.

Due to this genetic misprint the embryo may experience problems in the development during the first months of pregnancy. Approximately 20 to 40 days after fertilization, something goes wrong in the construction of the body parts and brain, which leads to a chain reaction.

Because of the repetitions in 1q21.1, there is a larger chance on an unequal crossing-over during [[meiosis]].

==Related genes==
Genes related to the proximal area are [[Hemojuvelin|HFE2]], [[TXNIP]], [[POLR3GL]], [[LIX1L]], [[RBM8A]], [[PEX11B]], [[ITGA10]], [[ANKRD35]], [[PIAS3]], [[NUDT17]], [[POLR3C]], [[RNF115]], [[CD160]], [[PDZK1]], and [[GPR89A]]&lt;br&gt;
Genes related to the distal area are [[PDE4DIP]], [[HYDIN2]], [[PRKAB2]], [[PDIA3P]], [[FMO5]], [[CHD1L]], [[BCL9]], [[ACP6]], [[GJA5]], [[GJA8]], [[NBPF10]], [[GPR89B]], [[GPR89C]], [[PDZK1P1]] and [[NBPF11]].

{{Antennas|systems}}

'''Antenna farm''' or '''satellite dish farm''' or just '''dish farm''' are terms used to describe an area dedicated to [[television]] or [[radio]] [[telecommunications]] transmitting or receiving antenna equipment, such as [[C band (IEEE)|C]], [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;]] or [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[Band (radio)|band]] [[satellite dish antenna]]s, [[UHF]]/[[VHF]]/[[AM broadcasting|AM]]/[[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[transmitter]] towers or mobile [[cell tower]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta - antenna farm |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561537876/antenna_farm.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKQy6iM?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561537876/antenna_farm.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Google Book Search]] - [https://books.google.com/books?id=xlZJno4LsLwC&amp;pg=PT71&amp;dq=Antenna+farm&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=SshGSvyxOI_wyASWr_VR&amp;client=opera Wireless telecom FAQs By Clint Smith]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Google Book Search]] - [https://books.google.com/books?id=s3LR9ZlSv-4C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=antenna+farm&amp;ei=s5UQStGfIYmkzATSoM3rBw&amp;client=opera Wireless Crash Course By Paul Bedell]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiber-optics.info/articles/l-band_satellite_transport Fiber-Optics.Info - L-Band Satellite Transport]&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the term "antenna farm" is uncertain, but it dates to at least the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;"Five Ideco Towers Take the Punishment at the Nation's Most Antenna Farm," Broadcasting-Telecasting, 14 October 1957, 79. http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1957/1957-10-14-BC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In telecom circles, any area with more than three antennas could be referred to as an antenna farm. In the case of an AM broadcasting station ([[mediumwave]] and [[longwave]], occasionally [[shortwave]]), the multiple [[mast radiator]]s may all be part of an antenna system for a single station, while for VHF and UHF the site may be under [[joint venture|joint management]].  Alternatively, a single tower with many separate antennas is often called a "[[candelabra]] tower".&lt;ref&gt;Google Book Search - [https://books.google.com/books?id=xTSNJhVlHGgC&amp;pg=PT977&amp;dq=candelabra+tower&amp;num=100&amp;ei=IJoQSoe2DpHGzATV4NCVAQ&amp;client=opera Antenna engineering handbook By Richard Clayton Johnson, Henry Jasik]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety and security ==

Commercial antenna farms are managed by [[radio station]]s, [[television station]]s, satellite [[Earth station#Telecommunications port|teleport]]s or military organizations and are mostly very [[security|secure]] facilities with access limited to [[broadcast engineer]]s, [[RF engineering|RF engineer]]s or [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] [[Engineering technician|technician]]s.  This is not only for the physical security of the location (including preventing [[Electrical equipment|equipment]]/[[metal theft]]), but also for safety, as there may be a [[radiation]] hazard unless stations are powered-down.

== Locations ==
[[Image:Mt Wilson antenna farm winter.jpeg|thumb|right|Antennas on [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]], covered in ice]]
Where [[terrain]] allows, [[summit|mountaintop]] sites are very attractive for non-AM [[Radio broadcasting|broadcast station]]s and others, because it increases the stations' [[height above average terrain]], allowing them to reach further by avoiding obstructions on the ground, and by increasing the [[radio horizon]].  With a clearer [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] in both cases, more signal can be received.  While the same is true of a very tall tower, such towers are expensive, dangerous, and difficult to access the top of, and may collect and drop large amounts of ice in winter, or even [[Structural failure|collapse]] in a severe ice storm and/or high winds.  Multiple small towers also allow stations to have backup facilities co-located on each other's towers for [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]].

Satellite antenna farms are usually located at remote locations, far away from urban development, especially high rise buildings or airplane flight paths, to avoid and minimize disruption to transmission and reception, and so as to not be an eyesore. Although most radio and TV stations are in fierce competition with each other in their broadcast markets, they will often locate their broadcasting antennas very near each other, and in some cases, will even share land or towers with each other, in the interests of space, land availability, and the cost of putting a transmission building on top of a mountain.

===In the United States===
[[Image:Erdfunkstelle Raisting 3.jpg|260px|thumb|right|The dish farm at the [[Raisting Satellite Earth Station]] complex and Telehouse, Germany's largest satellite communications facility in [[Raisting]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Penobscot Hill.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The [[antenna farm]] on [[Penobscot Knob]] before the coollapse of [[WNEP-TV]]'s tower]] --&gt;

Most [[metropolitan area]]s have at least one antenna farm, such as [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]] in [[Greater Los Angeles area|greater Los Angeles]] (seen at right), [[Sweat Mountain]] in [[metro Atlanta]], [[Farnsworth Peak]] for the [[Salt Lake Valley]], [[Riverview, Florida|Riverview]] in [[Tampa]], Florida, [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]'s [[Woodberry, Baltimore#Television Hill|Television Hill]] and [[Slide Mountain (Nevada)|Slide Mountain]] ([[Mt. Rose Ski Tahoe|Mount Rose ski area]]) in the [[Reno]]/[[Lake Tahoe|Tahoe]] area.  Some cities instead have combined many stations onto one tower, often through [[diplexer]]s into just one or two antennas, such as atop the [[Empire State Building]] in [[New York metropolitan area|New York]], the landmark [[Sutro Tower]] of [[San Francisco]], or the huge [[Miami Gardens]] tower serving the [[south Florida metropolitan area|Miami and Fort Lauderdale region]]. [[Cleveland, Ohio]] has its antenna farm in the suburb of [[Parma, Ohio]] due to Parma's high elevation. In central [[Oklahoma City]] most of the city's media outlets transmitter and tower facilities are located between the [[Kilpatrick Turnpike]] to the south and [[Interstate 44]] to the north, Broadway Extension to the west and [[Interstate 35]] to the east with Britton Road being the central thoroughfare. In addition, all three network affiliates and one of the 3 major radio groups have their studio facilities located within the [[Oklahoma City]] tower farm.

In the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of the Eastern United States, [[Poor Mountain]] serves most of the FM and TV stations in the [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]]/[[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] market. [[Holston Mountain]] in upper East Tennessee is home to most of the FM and TV stations in the Tri-Cities ([[Bristol, Virginia]]-[[Kingsport, Tennessee]]-[[Johnson City, Tennessee]]) DMA.  Other examples are [[Signal Mountain, Tennessee|Signal Mountain]] near Chattanooga, Tennessee, [[Sharp's Ridge]] in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Paris Mountain in [[Greenville, South Carolina]].

Other examples of co-located towers on mountain peaks in the United States are on Red Mountain in Birmingham, Alabama; [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]] near Los Angeles; the [[Sutro Tower]] in Clarendon Heights near [[Mount Sutro]] in San Francisco; [[Lookout Mountain, Colorado]] near Denver; Cedar Hill between Dallas and Fort Worth; [[South Mountain Park]] near Phoenix; Nelson Peak near Salt Lake City; [[Sandia Crest]] near Albuquerque, New Mexico. 

Probably the most famous broadcast antenna farm of all is the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] Tower One, on which many of the New York City television and several FM stations had their antennas. All were lost when Twin Towers One and Two collapsed after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. Most of those stations now broadcast from their previous home, 200 feet lower, on the Empire State Building.

==Objections==

Antenna farms have often been the source of complaints from local neighborhoods, particularly when a new tower is added.  This has been increasingly so for [[TV station]]s, which have been pursuing with alacrity the construction of new [[digital television]] antennas.  Because many of these towers are already full, or were built well before there was the expectation of DTV, many stations have been forced to go through the even greater expense of constructing a new tower.

One such situation was in [[Colorado]], in the late 1990s and early to mid-2000s.  Many of the [[Denver metropolitan area]] TV stations already transmitted analog TV from [[Lookout Mountain (Colorado)|Lookout Mountain]], but needed the extra space for more antennas.  Additionally, since many people live on Lookout Mountain, there was also the concern about safety, not only from falling ice or even the slight risk of a tower collapse, but also ongoing from the additional RF that it would create.  Residents and the city of [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]] filed legal objections, including challenging the authority of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to override denial of [[zoning]] permits by local government (in this case, the [[Jefferson County, Colorado|Jefferson]] [[county commission]]).  The city of Golden also sought to [[eminent domain|condemn]] the site, even though it was outside city limits.  It was decided that scenic [[Eldorado Mountain]] near [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] might be a better site, but there were also objections that it would ruin the view of that mountain from the valley.  Despite other alternatives, the new "supertower" was forced on Lookout Mountain by the [[U.S. Congress]], allowing the existing towers to be removed in 2009 after [[analog shutdown]].  The site began operating in spring 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media-visions.com/itv-denvertower1.html Media Visions Journal - Denver DTV 'Supertower'Faces Local Resistance by Ken Freed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2004/04/12/story8.html Denver Business Journal - HDTV tower project delayed by Amy Bryer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[TV Technology]] - [http://tv-technology.com/article/19858 Denver Lookout Mountain TV Tower Finished by Doug Lung]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Broadcast Engineering]] - [http://broadcastengineering.com/RF/dielectric-lookout-mountain-dtv-0821 Dielectric completes Lookout Mountain DTV transmission project serving Denver] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012214629/http://broadcastengineering.com/RF/dielectric-lookout-mountain-dtv-0821 |date=October 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[TV Technology]] - [http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/65788 Denver Finally Gets its DTV by Ken Freed]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asia Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics''' (APCTP) is an international non-governmental research institute for physical sciences. It is located in the Campus of the [[Pohang University of Science and Technology]] (POSTECH), in Pohang, South Korea. The centre was founded in 1996 by Nobel Laureate [[Chen-Ning Yang]].

==Structure and history==
The Asia Pacific Theoretical Physics Center is theoretical physics research leading, international joint research programs, in  the Asia-Pacific region. The APCTP  was founded in June 1996 as an international non-governmental organizations, with current member states: [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Republic of Korea]], [[Malaysia]], [[the Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], [[Mongolia]], [[India]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kazakhstan]] (16 countries).
The Asia Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics is a close-knit, multi-disciplinary research environment that hosts scientists working on challenging problems at the forefront of [[biophysics]], [[condensed matter]], [[quantum information]], [[astrophysics]], [[cosmology]] and [[particle physics]]. The institute also plays a key role in Korea by inviting international scholars, acting as a conduit for collaboration through focus workshops and training young scientists.
The APCTP, whose previous presidents include Nobel Laureates C. N. Yang and [[Robert B. Laughlin]], has a rich history and celebrated its 20th year in 2016. In 2008 APCTP established Junior Research Groups (JRG) under a previous president, [[Peter Fulde]], in collaboration with the [[Max Planck Society]] in [[Germany]], as a means to provide gifted young scientists with their first opportunity of managing research. The institute currently supports eight JRG groups.

The APCTP is located at the Pohang University for Science and Technology (POSTECH), which in addition to possessing established departments in both mathematics and the natural sciences, ranks globally within the top 100 universities. Moreover, the boutique campus currently boasts the [[POSTECH-Max Planck center for quantum materials]], as well as four centers from the Korean government flagship [[Institute for Basic Science (IBS)]] program, spanning low-dimensional electronic systems, immunology, self-assembly and notably, the only mathematics IBS center to date.

Ltd.|year=2011|isbn=9788120343139|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4TRuL7nDsj4C&amp;pg=PT89}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence is that each value in the tuple must be of some basic type, like a [[String (computer science)|string]] or an [[integer]]. For the elementary type to be atomic it cannot be broken into more pieces. Alas, the domain is an elementary type, and attribute domain the domain a given attribute belongs to an abstraction belonging to or characteristic of an entity.

For example in SQL ,one can create their own domain for an attribute with the command

  CREATE DOMAIN SSN_TYPE AS CHAR(9) ;

The above command says : "Create a datatype SSN_TYPE that is of character type with size 9 "

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4697">The '''United Nations Programme of Action on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States''', popularly referred to as the '''Barbados Program of Action''' ('''BPOA'''), is a policy document that both: comprehensively addresses the economic, environmental, and social developmental vulnerabilities facing islands; and outlines a strategy that seeks to mitigate those vulnerabilities. It remains the only internationally approved programme specific to [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDS) which has been collectively and unanimously endorsed by SIDS.

== Development of the BPOA ==
The full text of the BPOA was produced in [[Bridgetown, Barbados]] in 1994 at the first Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island States, a conference mandated by United Nations [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] [[Resolution (law)|Resolution]] 47/189. The need for an islands specific conference was highlighted some two years prior at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ([[Earth Summit]]), held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] where 179 governments voted to adopt [[Agenda 21]]. Chapter 17, section G of [[Agenda 21]] acknowledges that "small island developing states are a special case both for environment and development ... [and] are considered extremely vulnerable to global warming and sealevel rise."

== BPOA+5 ==
In 1999, the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the UN held a special session to appraise five years of progress on the implementation of the BPOA (BPOA +5). The Assembly recognized progress as 'uneven' and identified key trends including increasing [[globalization]], widening inequalities in income and a continued deterioration of the global environment. A new General Assembly [[Resolution (law)|Resolution]] (S-22/2) promised further action.

== BPOA+10 ==
The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, agreed to at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] ([[Earth Summit 2002]]) affirmed UN commitment to 'full implementation' of Agenda 21, alongside achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]], the BPOA, and other international agreements. To this end, it recommended the convening of an International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Program of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. Upon receipt of the recommendation, the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the UN passed [[Resolution (law)|Resolutions]] 57/262 and 58/213, which mandated an International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States to take place. The meeting was held in [[Port Louis, Mauritius]] between January 10-14, 2005. The final report emerging from this meeting significantly revised the original BPOA, and verified what previous reviews were alluding to, that the implementation of the BPOA had been largely unsuccessful. What emerged from it was a reorganising of the Programs "priority areas" and an entrenched commitment to the notion that economic growth would ultimately contribute to sustainable development.

The Rock 1 of Bedolina, the so-called '''Bedolina Map''', is a famous engraved prehistoric rock which is part of the [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica|Camonica valley]] (Alps, Italian side, [[Lombardy|Lombardy region]]) petroglyph complex. It is known as being one of the most ancient topographic maps,&lt;ref&gt;Beltrán Llorís M., 1972.

VIII], Capo di Ponte (BS): 121-158&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted as the depiction of cultivated plots, mountain paths and villages. The locality of Bedolina pertains to the [[Capo di Ponte]] municipality (BS-I), near the hamlet of Pescarzo.  The area is included in the [http://www.parcoseradinabedolina.it/ Seradina-Bedolina Archaeologic park], lying on a prominent terrace on the right slope  of  the Camonica valley, at an altitude of 530 m above the sea level. The rock, a flat surface of Permian sandstone (Verrucano of Lombardy) polished by the Pleistocene glacier, is 9&amp;nbsp;m long and 4&amp;nbsp;m wide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20150">In [[mathematics]], the '''Bianchi classification''', named for [[Luigi Bianchi]], is a classification of [[Lie algebra]]s.

==Classification==

===Lower Dimensions===

In zero dimensions, the only Lie algebra is the [[abelian Lie algebra]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;.  In one dimension, the only Lie algebra is the abelian Lie algebra '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with outer automorphism group the group of non-zero real numbers.

{{expand section|date=April 2017}}

===Dimension 2===

In two dimensions, there are two Lie algebras:

* The abelian Lie algebra '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with outer automorphism group GL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''').
* The [[solvable Lie algebra]] of 2×2 upper triangular matrices of trace 0. The simply connected group has trivial center and outer automorphism group of order 2; it is the [[affine group]] of the line.

{{expand section|date=April 2017}}

===Dimension 3===

The system classifies 3-dimensional real Lie algebras into 11 classes, 9 of which are single groups and two of which have a continuum of isomorphism classes. Sometimes{{according to whom|date=April 2017}} type Type VI and Type VII groups are included in the infinite families, giving 9 instead of 11 classes.

All the 3-dimensional Lie algebras other than types VIII and IX can be constructed as a semidirect product of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and '''R''', with '''R''' acting on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by some 2 by 2 matrix ''M''. The different types correspond to different types of matrices ''M'', as described below.

|}

====Type Ⅰ====

This is the abelian and unimodular Lie algebra '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The simply connected group has center '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and outer automorphism group GL&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''). This is the case when ''M'' is 0.

====Type Ⅱ====

[[Heisenberg algebra]]. The simply connected group has center '''R''' and outer automorphism group GL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''). This is the case when ''M'' is nilpotent but not 0 (eigenvalues all 0).

====Type Ⅲ====

This algebra is a product of '''R''' and the 2-dimensional non-abelian Lie algebra.  (It is a limiting case of type VI, where one eigenvalue becomes zero.) The simply connected group has center '''R''' and outer automorphism group the group of non-zero real numbers. The matrix ''M'' has one zero and one non-zero eigenvalue.

====Type Ⅳ====

[''y'',''z''] = 0, [''x'',''y''] = ''y'', [''x'', ''z''] = ''y'' + ''z''. The simply connected group has trivial center and outer automorphism group the product of the reals and a group of order 2. The matrix ''M'' has two equal non-zero eigenvalues, but is not semisimple (diagonalizable).

====Type Ⅴ====

[''y'',''z''] = 0, [''x'',''y''] = ''y'', [''x'', ''z''] = ''z''. (A limiting case of type VI where both eigenvalues are equal.) The simply connected group has trivial center and outer automorphism group the elements of GL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') of determinant +1 or −1. The matrix ''M'' has two equal eigenvalues, and is semisimple (diagonalizable).

====Type Ⅵ====

An infinite family. Semidirect products of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by '''R''', where the matrix ''M'' has non-zero distinct real eigenvalues with non-zero sum. The simply connected group has trivial center and outer automorphism group a product of the non-zero real numbers and a group of order 2.

====Type Ⅵ₀====

This Lie algebra is the semidirect product of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by '''R''', with '''R''' where the matrix ''M'' has non-zero distinct real eigenvalues with zero sum. It is the Lie algebra of the 2-dimensional [[Poincaré group]], the group of isometries of 2-dimensional [[Minkowski space]]. The simply connected group has trivial center and outer automorphism group the product of the [[positive real numbers]] with the [[dihedral group]] of order 8.

====Type Ⅶ====

An infinite family. Semidirect products of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by '''R''', where the matrix ''M'' has non-real and non-imaginary eigenvalues. The simply connected group has trivial center and outer automorphism group the non-zero reals.

====Type Ⅶ₀====

Semidirect products of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by '''R''', where the matrix ''M'' has non-zero imaginary eigenvalues. This is the Lie algebra of the group of isometries of the plane. The simply connected group has center '''Z''' and outer automorphism group a product of the non-zero real numbers and a group of order 2.

====Type Ⅷ====

The Lie algebra ''sl''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') of traceless 2 by 2 matrices.  The simply connected group has center '''Z''' and its outer automorphism group has order 2.

====Type Ⅸ====

The Lie algebra of the orthogonal group ''O''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''). The simply connected group has center of order 2 and trivial outer automorphism group, and is a [[spin group]].

The classification of 3-dimensional complex Lie algebras is similar except that types VIII and IX become isomorphic, and types VI and VII both become part of a single family of Lie algebras.

The connected 3-dimensional Lie groups can be classified as follows: they are a quotient of the corresponding simply connected Lie group by a discrete subgroup of the center, so can be read off from the table above.

The groups are related to the 8 geometries of Thurston's [[geometrization conjecture]]. More precisely, seven of the 8 geometries can be realized as a left-invariant metric on the simply connected group (sometimes in more than one way). The Thurston geometry of type ''S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''×'''R''' cannot be realized in this way.

====Structure constants====

The three-dimensional Bianchi spaces each admit a set of three [[Killing vector]]s &lt;math&gt;\xi^{(a)}_i&lt;/math&gt; which obey the following property:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\partial \xi^{(c)}_i}{\partial x^k} - \frac{\partial \xi^{(c)}_k}{\partial x^i} \right) \xi^i_{(a)} \xi^k_{(b)} = C^c_{\ ab}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C^c_{\ ab}&lt;/math&gt;, the "structure constants" of the group, form a [[constant (mathematics)|constant]] [[tensor|order-three tensor]] [[antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetric]] in its lower two indices. For any three-dimensional Bianchi space, &lt;math&gt;C^c_{\ ab}&lt;/math&gt; is given by the relationship

:&lt;math&gt;C^c_{\ ab} = \varepsilon_{abd}n^{cd} - \delta^c_a a_b + \delta^c_b a_a&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{abd}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]], &lt;math&gt;\delta^c_a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]], and the vector &lt;math&gt;a_a = (a,0,0)&lt;/math&gt; and [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]] tensor &lt;math&gt;n^{cd}&lt;/math&gt; are described by the following table, where &lt;math&gt;n^{(i)}&lt;/math&gt; gives the ''i''th [[eigenvalue]] of &lt;math&gt;n^{cd}&lt;/math&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Course of Theoretical Physics vol. 2: The Classical Theory of Fields |author=Lev Landau |author-link=Lev Landau  |author2=Evgeny Lifshitz|author2-link=Evgeny Lifshitz |last-author-amp=yes |isbn=978-0-7506-2768-9 |year=1980 |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the parameter ''a'' runs over all positive [[real number]]s:

The standard Bianchi classification can be derived from the structural constants in the following six steps:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Due to the antisymmetry &lt;math&gt;C_{ab}^c = -C_{ba}^c&lt;/math&gt;, there are nine independent constants &lt;math&gt;C_{ab}^c&lt;/math&gt;. These can be equivalently represented by the nine components of an arbitrary constant matrix ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{ab}^c = \varepsilon_{abd} C^{dc},&lt;/math&gt;

where ε&lt;sub&gt;''abd''&lt;/sub&gt; is the totally antisymmetric three-dimensional Levi-Civita symbol (ε&lt;sub&gt;123&lt;/sub&gt; = 1). Substitution of this expression for &lt;math&gt;C_{ab}^c&lt;/math&gt; into the [[Jacobi identity]], results in
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{abd} C^{bd} C^{ac} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The structure constants can be transformed as:
:&lt;math&gt;C^{ab} = \left (\det{A} \right )^{-1} A_m^a A_n^b \acute{C}^{mn}.&lt;/math&gt;
Appearance of det '''A''' in this formula is due to the fact that the symbol ε&lt;sub&gt;''abd''&lt;/sub&gt; transforms as tensor density: &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{abc} = \left ( \det{A} \right ) D_a^m D_b^n D_c^d \acute{\varepsilon}_{mnd}&lt;/math&gt;, where έ&lt;sub&gt;''mnd''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ ε&lt;sub&gt;''mnd''&lt;/sub&gt;. By this transformation it is always possible to reduce the matrix ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt; to the form:
:&lt;math&gt;C^{ab} = \begin{bmatrix}
n_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; C^{22} &amp; C^{23} \\
0 &amp; C^{32} &amp; C^{33}
\end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;
After such a choice, one still have the freedom of making triad transformations but with the restrictions &lt;math&gt;A_2^1 = A_3^1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_1^2 = A_1^3 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, the Jacobi identities give only one constraint:
:&lt;math&gt; \left ( C^{23} - C^{32} \right ) n_1 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0 then ''C''&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; – ''C''&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 and by the remaining transformations with &lt;math&gt;A_{\bar{b}}^{\bar{a}} \neq 0 , \quad \bar{a},\bar{b} = \bar{2},\bar{3}&lt;/math&gt;, the 2 × 2 matrix &lt;math&gt;C^{\bar{a} \bar{b}}&lt;/math&gt; in ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt; can be made diagonal. Then
:&lt;math&gt;C^{ab} = \begin{bmatrix}
n_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; n_2 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; n_3
\end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;
The diagonality condition for ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt; is preserved under the transformations with diagonal &lt;math&gt;A_b^a&lt;/math&gt;. Under these transformations, the three parameters ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; change in the following way:
:&lt;math&gt;n_a = \left ( A_1^1 A_2^2 A_3^3 \right ) \left ( A_a^a \right )^2 \acute{n}_a, \text{no summation over} \ a.&lt;/math&gt;
By these diagonal transformations, the modulus of any ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; (if it is not zero) can be made equal to unity. Taking into account that the simultaneous change of sign of all ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; produce nothing new, one arrives to the following invariantly different sets for the numbers ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (invariantly different in the sense that there is no way to pass from one to another by some transformation of the triad &lt;math&gt;e_a^{\bar{a}} = A_{\bar{b}}^{\bar{a}} e_a^{\bar{b}}&lt;/math&gt;), that is to the following different types of homogeneous
spaces with diagonal matrix ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
Bianchi \ IX &amp; : &amp; (n_1, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (1, 1, 1), \\
Bianchi \ VIII &amp; : &amp; (n_1, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (1, 1, -1), \\
Bianchi \ VII_0 &amp; : &amp; (n_1, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (1, 1, 0), \\
Bianchi \ VI_0 &amp; : &amp; (n_1, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (1, -1, 0), \\
Bianchi \ II &amp; : &amp; (n_1, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (1, 0, 0).
\end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider now the case ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. It can also happen in that case that ''C''&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; – ''C''&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; = 0. This returns to the situation already analyzed in the previous step but with the additional condition ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. Now, all essentially different types for the sets ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are (0, 1, 1), (0, 1, −1), (0, 0, 1) and (0, 0, 0). The first three repeat the types ''VII''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''VI''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''II''. Consequently, only one new type arises:
:&lt;math&gt;Bianchi \ I \ : \ (n_1 , n_2 , n_3) \ = \ (0, 0, 0).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only case left is ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''C''&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; – ''C''&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; ≠ 0. Now the 2 × 2 matrix &lt;math&gt;C^{\bar{a} \bar{b}} ( \bar{a}, \bar{b} = 2, 3)&lt;/math&gt; is non-symmetric and it cannot be made diagonal by transformations using &lt;math&gt;A_{\bar{b}}^{\bar{a}} \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. However, its symmetric part can be diagonalized, that is the 3 × 3 matrix ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt; can be reduced to the form:
:&lt;math&gt;C^{ab} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; n_2 &amp; a \\
0 &amp; -a &amp; n_3
\end{bmatrix}, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'' is an arbitrary number. After this is done, there still remains the possibility to perform transformations with diagonal &lt;math&gt;A_{\bar{b}}^{\bar{a}}&lt;/math&gt;, under which the quantities ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a'' change as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;n_2 = \left ( A_1^1 A_2^2 A_3^3 \right )^{-1} \left ( A_2^2 \right )^2 \acute{n}_2, \quad n_3 = \left ( A_1^1 A_2^2 A_3^3 \right )^{-1} \left ( A_3^3 \right )^2 \acute{n}_3, \quad a = \left ( A_1^1 \right )^{-1} \acute{a}.&lt;/math&gt;
These formulas show that for nonzero ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a'', the combination ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is an invariant quantity. By a choice of &lt;math&gt;A_1^1&lt;/math&gt;, one can impose the condition ''a'' &gt; 0 and after this is done, the choice of the sign of &lt;math&gt;A_3^3 \left ( A_2^2 \right )^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; permits one to change both signs of ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; simultaneously, that is the set (''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; , ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is equivalent to the set (−''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,−''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). It follows that there are the following four different possibilities:
:&lt;math&gt;(a, n_2, n_3 ) = (a, 0, 0), (a, 0, 1), (a, 1, 1), (a, 1,-1).&lt;/math&gt;
For the first two, the number ''a'' can be transformed to unity by a choice of
the parameters &lt;math&gt;A_1^1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_3^3 \left ( A_2^2 \right )^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. For the second two possibilities, both of these parameters are already fixed and ''a'' remains an invariant and arbitrary positive number. Historically these four types of homogeneous spaces have been classified as:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
Bianchi \ V &amp; : &amp; n_1 = 0, \ (a, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (1, 0, 0), \\
Bianchi \ IV &amp; : &amp; n_1 = 0, \ (a, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (1, 0, 1), \\
Bianchi \ VII &amp; : &amp; n_1 = 0, \ (a, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (a, 1, 1), \\
Bianchi \ III &amp; : &amp; n_1 = 0, \ (a, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (1, 1, -1), \\
Bianchi \ VI &amp; : &amp; n_1 = 0, \ (a, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (a, 1, -1).
\end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;
Type ''III'' is just a particular case of type ''VI'' corresponding to ''a'' = 1. Types ''VII'' and ''VI'' contain an infinity of invariantly different types of algebras corresponding to the arbitrariness of the continuous parameter ''a''. Type ''VII''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a particular case of ''VII'' corresponding to ''a'' = 0 while type ''VI''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a particular case of ''VI'' corresponding also to ''a'' = 0.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

==Curvature of Bianchi spaces==
The Bianchi spaces have the property that their [[Ricci tensor]]s can be [[separation of variables|separated]] into a product of the [[basis vector]]s associated with the space and a coordinate-independent tensor.

For a given [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] 
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = \gamma_{ab} \xi^{(a)}_i \xi^{(b)}_k dx^i dx^k&lt;/math&gt;
(where &lt;math&gt;\xi^{(a)}_idx^i&lt;/math&gt;　are [[differential form|1-forms]]), the Ricci curvature tensor &lt;math&gt;R_{ik}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;R_{ik} = R_{(a)(b)} \xi^{(a)}_i \xi^{(b)}_k&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_{(a)(b)} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ C^{cd}_{\ \ b} \left( C_{cda} + C_{dca} \right) + C^c_{\  cd} \left( C^{\ \ d}_{ab} + C^{\ \ d}_{ba} \right) - \frac{1}{2} C^{\ cd}_b C_{acd} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where the indices on the structure constants are raised and lowered with &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; which is not a function of &lt;math&gt;x^i&lt;/math&gt;.

== Cosmological application ==
In [[cosmology]], this classification is used for a [[homogeneous space|homogeneous]] [[spacetime]] of dimension 3+1. The 3-dimensional Lie group is as the symmetry group of  the 3-dimensional spacelike slice, and the Lorentz metric satisfying the Einstein equation is generated by varying the metric components as a function of t. The [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]]s are isotropic, which are particular cases of types I, V, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\text{VII}_h&lt;/math&gt; and IX. The Bianchi type I models include the [[Kasner metric]]  as a special case.
The Bianchi IX cosmologies include the [[Taub-NUT vacuum|Taub metric]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Wald]], ''General Relativity'', [[University of Chicago Press]] (1984). {{ISBN|0-226-87033-2}}, (chapt 7.2, pages 168–179)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the dynamics near the singularity is approximately governed by a series of successive Kasner (Bianchi I) periods. The complicated dynamics,
which essentially amounts to billiard motion in a portion of hyperbolic space, exhibits chaotic behaviour, and is named [[Mixmaster universe|Mixmaster]]; its analysis is referred to as the [[BKL singularity|BKL analysis]] after Belinskii, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz.

In [[computing]], a '''cache''' ({{IPAc-en|k|æ|ʃ}} {{respell|kash}},&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|title=Cache

|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere.  A ''cache hit'' occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a ''cache miss'' occurs when it cannot.  Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache, which is faster than recomputing a result or reading from a slower data store; thus, the more requests that can be served from the cache, the faster the system performs.

To be cost-effective and to enable efficient use of data, caches must be relatively small. Nevertheless, caches have proven themselves in many areas of computing, because typical [[Application software|computer applications]] access data with a high degree of [[locality of reference]]. Such access patterns exhibit temporal locality, where data is requested that has been recently requested already, and [[memory address|spatial]] locality, where data is requested that is stored physically close to data that has already been requested.

== Motivation ==
There is an inherent trade-off between size and speed (given that a larger resource implies greater physical distances) but also a tradeoff between expensive, premium technologies (such as [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]]) vs cheaper, easily mass-produced commodities (such as [[DRAM]] or [[hard disk]]s).

The [[Data buffer|buffering]] provided by a cache benefits both [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and [[latency (engineering)|latency]]:

=== Latency ===
A larger resource incurs a significant [[latency (engineering)|latency]] for access{{snd}} e.g. it can take hundreds of clock cycles for a modern 4&amp;nbsp;GHz processor to reach [[DRAM]]. This is mitigated by reading in large chunks, in the hope that subsequent reads will be from nearby locations. Prediction or explicit [[CPU cache#prefetch|prefetching]] might also guess where future reads will come from and make requests ahead of time; if done correctly the latency is bypassed altogether.

=== Throughput  ===
The use of a cache also allows for higher [[throughput]] from the underlying resource, by assembling multiple fine grain transfers into larger, more efficient requests. In the case of [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]] circuits, this might be served by having a wider data bus. For example, consider a program accessing bytes in a 32-bit address space, but being served by a 128-bit off-chip data bus; individual uncached byte accesses would allow only 1/16th of the total [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to be used, and 80% of the data movement would be memory addresses instead of data itself. Reading larger chunks reduces the fraction of bandwidth required for transmitting address information.

== {{Anchor|CACHE-HIT}}Operation ==
Hardware implements cache as a [[block (data storage)|block]] of memory for temporary storage of data likely to be used again. [[Central processing unit]]s (CPUs) and [[hard disk drive]]s (HDDs) frequently use a cache, as do [[web browser]]s and [[web server]]s.

A cache is made up of a pool of entries. Each entry has associated ''data'', which is a copy of the same data in some ''backing store''. Each entry also has a ''tag'', which specifies the identity of the data in the backing store of which the entry is a copy.

When the cache client (a CPU, web browser, [[operating system]]) needs to access data presumed to exist in the backing store, it first checks the cache. If an entry can be found with a tag matching that of the desired data, the data in the entry is used instead. This situation is known as a '''cache hit'''. For example, a web browser program might check its local cache on disk to see if it has a local copy of the contents of a web page at a particular [[URL]]. In this example, the URL is the tag, and the content of the web page is the data. The percentage of accesses that result in cache hits is known as the '''hit rate''' or '''hit ratio''' of the cache.

The alternative situation, when the cache is checked and found not to contain any entry with the desired tag, is known as a '''cache miss'''. This requires a more expensive access of data from the backing store. Once the requested data is retrieved, it is typically copied into the cache, ready for the next access.

During a cache miss, some other previously existing cache entry is removed in order to make room for the newly retrieved data. The [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] used to select the entry to replace is known as the [[Cache algorithm|replacement policy]]. One popular replacement policy, "least recently used" (LRU), replaces the oldest entry, the entry that was accessed less recently than any other entry (see [[cache algorithm]]). More efficient caching algorithms compute the use-hit frequency against the size of the stored contents, as well as the [[Access time|latencies]] and throughputs for both the cache and the backing store. This works well for larger amounts of data, longer latencies, and slower throughputs, such as that experienced with hard drives and networks, but is not efficient for use within a CPU cache.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

=== {{Anchor|Dirty|WRITEPOLICIES|WRITE-BACK|WRITE-BEHIND|WRITE-THROUGH|WRITE-AROUND}}Writing policies ===
[[File:Write-through with no-write-allocation.svg|thumb|right|A write-through cache with no-write allocation]]
[[File:Write-back with write-allocation.svg|thumb|right|A write-back cache with write allocation]]

{{Main article|Cache coherence}}

When a system writes data to cache, it must at some point write that data to the backing store as well. The timing of this write is controlled by what is known as the ''write policy''.
There are two basic writing approaches:

* ''Write-through'': write is done synchronously both to the cache and to the backing store.
* ''Write-back'' (also called ''write-behind''): initially, writing is done only to the cache. The write to the backing store is postponed until the modified content is about to be replaced by another cache block.

A write-back cache is more complex to implement, since it needs to track which of its locations have been written over, and mark them as ''dirty'' for later writing to the backing store. The data in these locations are written back to the backing store only when they are evicted from the cache, an effect referred to as a ''lazy write''. For this reason, a read miss in a write-back cache (which requires a block to be replaced by another) will often require two memory accesses to service: one to write the replaced data from the cache back to the store, and then one to retrieve the needed data.

Other policies may also trigger data write-back. The client may make many changes to data in the cache, and then explicitly notify the cache to write back the data.

Since no data is returned to the requester on write operations, a decision needs to be made on write misses, whether or not data would be loaded into the cache.
This is defined by these two approaches:

* ''Write allocate'' (also called ''fetch on write''): data at the missed-write location is loaded to cache, followed by a write-hit operation. In this approach, write misses are similar to read misses.
* ''No-write allocate'' (also called ''write-no-allocate'' or ''write around''): data at the missed-write location is not loaded to cache, and is written directly to the backing store. In this approach, data is loaded into the cache on read misses only.

Both write-through and write-back policies can use either of these write-miss policies, but usually they are paired in this way:&lt;ref name="HennessyPatterson2011"&gt;

* A write-back cache uses write allocate, hoping for subsequent writes (or even reads) to the same location, which is now cached.
* A write-through cache uses no-write allocate. Here, subsequent writes have no advantage, since they still need to be written directly to the backing store.

Entities other than the cache may change the data in the backing store, in which case the copy in the cache may become out-of-date or ''stale''. Alternatively, when the client updates the data in the cache, copies of those data in other caches will become stale. Communication protocols between the cache managers which keep the data consistent are known as [[cache coherency|coherency protocols]].

=={{anchor|HARDWARE}}Examples of hardware caches==
=== CPU cache ===
{{Main article|CPU cache}}

Small memories on or close to the [[CPU]] can operate faster than the much larger [[main memory]]. Most CPUs since the 1980s have used one or more caches, sometimes [[CPU cache#Multi-level caches|in cascaded levels]]; modern high-end [[Embedded computing|embedded]], [[Desktop computer|desktop]] and server [[microprocessor]]s may have as many as six types of cache (between levels and functions),.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=intel broad well core i7 with 128mb L4 cache|url=http://wccftech.com/intel-broadwell-core-i7-5775c-128mb-l4-cache-and-skylake-core-i7-6700k-flagship-processors-available-retail/}}Mentions L4 cache. Combined with separate I-Cache and TLB, this brings the total 'number of caches (levels+functions) to 6&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of caches with a specific function are the [[D-cache]] and [[I-cache]] and the [[translation lookaside buffer]] for the [[Memory management unit|MMU]].

=== {{Anchor|GPU}}GPU cache ===
Earlier [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs) often had limited read-only [[texture cache]]s, and introduced [[morton order]] [[swizzled texture]]s to improve 2D [[cache coherency]]. [[Cache miss]]es would drastically affect performance, e.g. if [[mipmapping]] was not used. Caching was important to leverage 32-bit (and wider) transfers for texture data that was often as little as 4&amp;nbsp;bits per pixel, indexed in complex patterns by arbitrary [[UV coordinates]] and [[perspective transformation]]s in [[inverse texture mapping]].

As GPUs advanced (especially with [[GPGPU]] [[compute shader]]s) they have developed progressively larger and increasingly general caches, including [[instruction cache]]s for [[shader]]s, exhibiting increasingly common functionality with CPU caches.&lt;ref name="ReferenceGCS7"&gt;S. Mittal, "[https://www.academia.edu/6940614/A_Survey_of_Techniques_for_Managing_and_Leveraging_Caches_in_GPUs A Survey of Techniques for Managing and Leveraging Caches in GPUs]", JCSC, 23(8), 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[GeForce 200 series|GT200]] architecture GPUs did not feature an L2 cache, while the [[Fermi (microarchitecture)|Fermi]] GPU has 768&amp;nbsp;KB of last-level cache, the [[Kepler (microarchitecture)|Kepler]] GPU has 1536&amp;nbsp;KB of last-level cache,&lt;ref name="ReferenceGCS7"/&gt; and the [[Maxwell (microarchitecture)|Maxwell]] GPU has 2048&amp;nbsp;KB of last-level cache. These caches have grown to handle [[synchronisation primitive]]s between threads and [[atomic operation]]s, and interface with a CPU-style [[Memory management unit|MMU]].

=== DSPs ===
[[Digital signal processor]]s have similarly generalised over the years. Earlier designs used [[scratchpad memory]] fed by [[Direct memory access|DMA]], but modern DSPs such as [[Qualcomm Hexagon]] often include a very similar set of caches to a CPU (e.g. [[Modified Harvard architecture]] with shared L2, split L1 I-cache and D-cache).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=qualcom Hexagon DSP SDK overview|url=https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/hexagon-dsp-sdk/dsp-processor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Translation lookaside buffer ===
{{Main article|Translation lookaside buffer}}

A [[memory management unit]] (MMU) that fetches page table entries from main memory has a specialized cache, used for recording the results of [[virtual address]] to [[physical address]] translations. This specialized cache is called a [[translation lookaside buffer]] (TLB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Software caches ==

=== Disk cache ===
{{Main article|Page cache}}

While CPU caches are generally managed entirely by hardware, a variety of software manages other caches. The [[page cache]] in main memory, which is an example of disk cache, is managed by the operating system [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]].

While the [[disk buffer]], which is an integrated part of the hard disk drive, is sometimes misleadingly referred to as "disk cache", its main functions are write sequencing and read prefetching. Repeated cache hits are relatively rare, due to the small size of the buffer in comparison to the drive's capacity. However, high-end [[disk controller]]s often have their own on-board cache of the hard disk drive's [[Block (data storage)|data blocks]].

Finally, a fast local hard disk drive can also cache information held on even slower data storage devices, such as remote servers ([[web cache]]) or local [[tape drive]]s or [[optical jukebox]]es; such a scheme is the main concept of [[hierarchical storage management]].  Also, fast flash-based [[solid-state drive]]s (SSDs) can be used as caches for slower rotational-media hard disk drives, working together as [[hybrid drive]]s or [[solid-state hybrid drive]]s (SSHDs).

=== Web cache ===
{{Main article|Web cache}}

[[Web browser]]s and [[Proxy server|web proxy servers]] employ web caches to store previous responses from [[web server]]s, such as [[web page]]s and [[image]]s. Web caches reduce the amount of information that needs to be transmitted across the network, as information previously stored in the cache can often be re-used. This reduces bandwidth and processing requirements of the web server, and helps to improve [[responsiveness]] for users of the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Web_application/Caching | title=Web application caching | author=Multiple (wiki) | work=Docforge | accessdate=2013-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Web browsers employ a built-in web cache, but some [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) or organizations also use a caching proxy server, which is a web cache that is shared among all users of that network.

Another form of cache is [[P2P caching]], where the files most sought for by [[peer-to-peer]] applications are stored in an [[Internet service provider|ISP]] cache to accelerate P2P transfers. Similarly, decentralised equivalents exist, which allow communities to perform the same task for P2P traffic, for example, Corelli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Gareth Tyson|author2=Andreas Mauthe|author3=Sebastian Kaune|author4=Mu Mu|author5=Thomas Plagemann|title=Corelli: A Dynamic Replication Service for Supporting Latency-Dependent Content in Community Networks|conference=MMCN'09|url=http://comp.eprints.lancs.ac.uk/2044/1/MMCN09.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618193018/http://comp.eprints.lancs.ac.uk/2044/1/MMCN09.pdf|archive-date=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memoization ===
{{Main article|Memoization}}&lt;!-- NOTE: this is *NOT* a typo for "memorization"! --&gt;

A cache can store data that is computed on demand rather than retrieved from a backing store.  [[Memoization]] is an [[Program optimization|optimization]] technique that stores the results of resource-consuming [[function call]]s within a lookup table, allowing subsequent calls to reuse the stored results and avoid repeated computation. It is related to the [[dynamic programming]] algorithm design methodology, which can also be thought of as a means of caching.

=== Other caches ===
The BIND [[Domain Name System|DNS]] daemon caches a mapping of domain names to [[IP address]]es, as does a resolver library.

Write-through operation is common when operating over unreliable networks (like an Ethernet LAN), because of the enormous complexity of the [[cache coherency|coherency protocol]] required between multiple write-back caches when communication is unreliable. For instance, web page caches and [[client-side]] [[Network File System|network file system]] caches (like those in [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] or [[Server Message Block|SMB]]) are typically read-only or write-through specifically to keep the network protocol simple and reliable.

[[Web search engine|Search engine]]s also frequently make [[web page]]s they have indexed available from their cache. For example, [[Google]] provides a "Cached" link next to each search result. This can prove useful when web pages from a [[web server]] are temporarily or permanently inaccessible.

Another type of caching is storing computed results that will likely be needed again, or&lt;!-- yes, this really is memoization; it is not a typo --&gt; [[memoization]]. For example, [[ccache]]&lt;!-- nor is this a typo, "ccache" is C compiler cache --&gt; is a program that caches the output of the compilation, in order to speed up later compilation runs.

[[Database caching]] can substantially improve the throughput of [[database]] applications, for example in the processing of [[Database index|indexes]], [[Data dictionary|data dictionaries]], and frequently used subsets of data.

== Buffer vs. cache ==
The semantics of a "buffer" and a "cache" are not totally different; even so, there are fundamental differences in intent between the process of caching and the process of buffering.

Fundamentally, caching realizes a performance increase for transfers of data that is being repeatedly transferred. While a caching system may realize a performance increase upon the initial (typically write) transfer of a data item, this performance increase is due to buffering occurring within the caching system.

With read caches, a data item must have been fetched from its residing location at least once in order for subsequent reads of the data item to realize a performance increase by virtue of being able to be fetched from the cache's (faster) intermediate storage rather than the data's residing location. With write caches, a performance increase of writing a data item may be realized upon the first write of the data item by virtue of the data item immediately being stored in the cache's intermediate storage, deferring the transfer of the data item to its residing storage at a later stage or else occurring as a background process. Contrary to strict buffering, a caching process must adhere to a (potentially distributed) cache coherency protocol in order to maintain consistency between the cache's intermediate storage and the location where the data resides. Buffering, on the other hand,

* reduces the number of transfers for otherwise novel data amongst communicating processes, which amortizes overhead involved for several small transfers over fewer, larger transfers,
* provides an intermediary for communicating processes which are incapable of direct transfers amongst each other, or
* ensures a minimum data size or representation required by at least one of the communicating processes involved in a transfer.

With typical caching implementations, a data item that is read or written for the first time is effectively being buffered; and in the case of a write, mostly realizing a performance increase for the application from where the write originated. Additionally, the portion of a caching protocol where individual writes are deferred to a batch of writes is a form of buffering. The portion of a caching protocol where individual reads are deferred to a batch of reads is also a form of buffering, although this form may negatively impact the performance of at least the initial reads (even though it may positively impact the performance of the sum of the individual reads). In practice, caching almost always involves some form of buffering, while strict buffering does not involve caching.

A [[data buffer|buffer]] is a temporary memory location that is traditionally used because CPU [[instruction (computing)|instruction]]s cannot directly address data stored in peripheral devices. Thus, addressable memory is used as an intermediate stage. Additionally, such a buffer may be feasible when a large block of data is assembled or disassembled (as required by a storage device), or when data may be delivered in a different order than that in which it is produced. Also, a whole buffer of data is usually transferred sequentially (for example to hard disk), so buffering itself sometimes increases transfer performance or reduces the variation or jitter of the transfer's latency as opposed to caching where the intent is to reduce the latency. These benefits are present even if the buffered data are written to the [[Data buffer|buffer]] once and read from the buffer once.

A cache also increases transfer performance. A part of the increase similarly comes from the possibility that multiple small transfers will combine into one large block. But the main performance-gain occurs because there is a good chance that the same data will be read from cache multiple times, or that written data will soon be read. A cache's sole purpose is to reduce accesses to the underlying slower storage. Cache is also usually an [[abstraction layer]] that is designed to be invisible from the perspective of neighboring layers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11754">'''Cognitive bias in animals''' is a pattern of deviation in judgment, whereby inferences about other animals and situations may be affected by irrelevant information or [[emotional state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Haselton, M. G. |author2=Nettle, D. |author3= Andrews, P. W. |last-author-amp=yes |chapter=The evolution of cognitive bias|year=2005|location=Hoboken, NJ, US|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc|editor=D. M. Buss|title=The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|pages=724–746}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes said that animals create their own "subjective social reality" from their perception of the input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bless, H. |author2=Fiedler, K. |author3= Strack, F. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Social cognition: How individuals construct social reality.|year=2004|publisher=Hove and New York: Psychology Press|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, for example, an [[optimistic]] or [[pessimistic]] bias might affect one's answer to the question "Is the glass half empty or half full?"

To explore [[cognitive bias]], one might train an animal to expect that a positive event follows one stimulus and that a negative event follows another stimulus. For example, on many trials, if the animal presses lever A after a 20&amp;nbsp;Hz tone it gets a highly desired food, but a press on lever B after a 10&amp;nbsp;Hz tone yields bland food. The animal is then offered both levers after an intermediate test stimulus, e.g. a 15&amp;nbsp;Hz tone. The hypothesis is that the animal's "mood" will bias the choice of levers after the test stimulus; if positive, it will tend to choose lever A, if negative it will tend to choose lever B. The hypothesis is tested by manipulating factors that might affect mood – for example, the type of housing the animal is kept in.&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harding|first1=EJ|last2=Paul|first2=ES|last3=Mendl|first3=M|year=2004|title=Animal behaviour: cognitive bias and affective state|journal=Nature|volume=427|issue=6972|pages=312|doi=10.1038/427312a|pmid=14737158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive biases have been shown in a wide range of species including rats, dogs, rhesus macaques, sheep, chicks, starlings and honeybees.&lt;ref name="Rygula" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mendl et al., (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mendl, M.|author2=Burman, O.H.P.|author3=Parker, R.M.A.|author4=Paul, E.S.|last-author-amp=yes |year=2009|title=Cognitive bias as an indicator of animal emotion and welfare: emerging evidence and underlying mechanisms|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=118|pages=161–181|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2009.02.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In rats==
In what has been described as a "landmark study",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|year=2010|volume=35|pages=1008–1015|doi=10.1038/npp.2009.204|title=Ambiguous-cue interpretation is biased under stress- and depression-like states in rats.|author=Enkel, T.|author2=Gholizadeh, D.|author3=von Bohlen und Halbach, O. |author4=Sanchis-Segura, C.|author5=Hurlemann, R.|author6=Spanage, R.|author7=Gass P.|author8=Vollmayr, B.|lastauthoramp=y|pmid=20043002|pmc=3055368}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first study of cognitive bias in animals was conducted with rats.  This showed that laboratory rats in unpredictable environments had a more pessimistic attitude than rats in predictable environments.&lt;ref name="Harding" /&gt;

One study on rats investigated whether changes in light intensity – a short-term manipulation of emotional state – has an effect on cognitive bias.  Light intensity was chosen as a treatment because this specifically relates to anxiety-induction. Rats were trained to discriminate between two different locations, in either high ('H') or low ('L') light levels. One location was rewarded with palatable food and the other with aversive food. Rats switched from high to low light levels (putatively the least negative [[emotional manipulation]]) ran faster to all three ambiguous locations than rats switched from low to high light levels (putatively the most negative manipulation).&lt;ref name="Burman 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Physiology and Behavior|volume=98|issue=3|year=2009|pages=345–350|title=Anxiety-induced cognitive bias in non-human animals|author1=Burman, O.H.P.|author2=Parker, R.M.A.|author3=Paul, E.S.|author4=Mendl, M.T.|lastauthoramp=y|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2009.06.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study investigated whether chronic [[social defeat]] makes rats more pessimistic. To induce chronic [[psychosocial]] stress, rats were subjected to daily social defeat in a resident–intruder paradigm for three weeks. This chronic psychosocial [[psychological stress|stress]] makes rats more pessimistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chronic psychosocial stress makes rats more 'pessimistic' in the ambiguous-cue interpretation paradigm|author=Papciaka, J.|author2=Popika, P.|author3=Fuchsc, E.|author4=Rygula, R.|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|volume=256|year=2013|pages=305–310|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2013.08.036|pmid=23993861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the cognitive bias approach, it has been found that rats which are subjected to either handling or playful, experimenter-administered manual stimulation (tickling) showed different responses to the intermediate stimulus: rats exposed to tickling were more optimistic.&lt;ref name="Rygula"&gt;{{cite journal|
first1=R|last1=Rygula|first2=H|last2=Pluta|last3=P|first3=Popik|title=Laughing rats are optimistic|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=12|pages=e51959|pmc=3530570|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0051959|pmid=23300582}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors stated that they had demonstrated "...for the first time a link between the directly measured positive affective state and decision making under uncertainty in an animal model".

==In pet dogs==
Up to five million pet dogs in the UK, approximately 50% of the population, may perform undesirable separation-related behaviour when left home alone.  Dogs were trained to move from a start position to a food bowl. When the bowl was on one side of the room ('positive' location, P) it contained a small quantity of food, and when on the opposite side ('negative' location, N) it was empty.  In test trials, the bowl (empty) was placed at one of three ambiguous locations between P and N (near-positive (NP), middle (M), or near-negative (NN).  Three test trials were presented at each location. The researchers measured how quickly the dogs moved to the ambiguous locations, fast indicating anticipation of food (an 'optimistic' judgement) or more slowly (a 'pessimistic' judgement).{{clarify|date=January 2018}}  These cognitive bias tests show that dogs which exhibit high levels of separation-related behaviour in a separation test also have a more negative underlying mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Mendl, M.|author2=Brooks, J.|author3= Basse, C.|author4=Burman, O.|author5=Paul, E.|author6=Blackwell, E.|author7=Casey, R.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Dogs showing separation-related behaviour exhibit a 'pessimistic' cognitive bias|journal=Current Biology|volume=20|issue=19|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.08.030 |year=2010|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0960982210010201/1-s2.0-S0960982210010201-main.pdf?_tid=dca3e6e0-ad47-11e4-bc9f-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1423148668_0e54a842bf173b32ae557174ec0bb5f2|pages=R839–R840|pmid=20937467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In pigs==
Domestic pigs do not appear to develop a cognitive bias when kept in different stocking densities.  Farmed pigs trained to expect food inside a bowl in one location and not in another, and then tested to show their responses to ambiguous spatial locations. Forty growing pigs were housed in groups of 10 at different density for 8 weeks prior to the start of the test.  Tests on three occasions for each pig did not reveal any difference in cognitive bias according to the pig's history of stocking density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=153|year=2014|pages=26–35|title=Does stocking density modify affective state in pigs as assessed by cognitive bias, behavioural and physiological parameters?|author1=Scolloa, A. |author2=Gottardob F. |author3=Contierob B. |author4=Edwards, S.A. |last-author-amp=yes |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2014.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study shows that restriction of [[Collared peccary|collared peccaries]] (''Pecari tajacu'') in metabolism pens affects their emotional state and increases feacal [[glucocorticoid]] (a stress hormone) [[metabolite]] concentrations.  The researchers noted that  these effects were mitigated by [[Behavioural enrichment|environmental enrichment]].&lt;ref name="Oliveira"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Oliveira, F.R.M.|author2=Sérgio L.G.|author3= Nogueira-Filho, S.L.G.|author4= Sousa, M.B.C.|author5=Dias, C.T.S.|author6=Mendl, M.|author7=Nogueira, S.S.C.|last-author-amp=yes |title=Measurement of cognitive bias and cortisol levels to evaluate the effects of space restriction on captive collared peccary (Mammalia, Tayassuidae)|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|year=2016|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2016.05.021|volume=181|pages=76–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In honeybees==
[[File:Honeybee-27527-1.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Honeybees become pessimistic after being shaken]]
Honeybees (''[[Apis mellifera carnica]]'') were trained to extend their [[proboscis]] to a two-component odour mixture (CS+) predicting a reward (e.g., 1.00 or 2.00 M [[sucrose]]) and to withhold their proboscis from another mixture (CS−) predicting either punishment or a less valuable reward (e.g., 0.01 M [[quinine]] solution or 0.3 M sucrose).  Immediately after training, half of the honeybees were subjected to vigorous shaking for 60 s to simulate the state produced by a predatory attack on a concealed colony. This shaking reduced levels of [[octopamine (neurotransmitter)|octopamine]], [[dopamine]], and [[serotonin]] in the [[hemolymph]] of a separate group of honeybees at a time point corresponding to when the cognitive bias tests were performed. In honeybees, octopamine is the local [[neurotransmitter]] that functions during reward learning, whereas dopamine mediates the ability to learn to associate odours with quinine punishment.  If flies are fed serotonin, they are more aggressive; flies depleted of serotonin still exhibit aggression, but they do so much less frequently.

Within 5 minutes of the shaking, all the trained bees began a sequence of unreinforced test trials with five odour stimuli presented in a random order for each bee: the CS+, the CS−, and three novel odours composed of ratios intermediate between the two learned mixtures. Shaken honeybees were more likely to withhold their mouthparts from the CS− and from the most similar novel odour. Therefore, agitated honeybees display an increased expectation of bad outcomes similar to a vertebrate-like emotional state.  The researchers of the study stated that, "Although our results do not allow us to make any claims about the presence of negative subjective feelings in honeybees, they call into question how we identify emotions in any nonhuman animal. It is logically inconsistent to claim that the presence of pessimistic cognitive biases should be taken as confirmation that dogs or rats are anxious but to deny the same conclusion in the case of honeybees."&lt;ref name="Bateson"&gt;{{cite journal|

'''Cultural eutrophication''' is the process that speeds up natural [[eutrophication]] because of human activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/146210/cultural-eutrophication Cultural eutrophication] (2010) ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved April 26, 2010, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online:
&lt;/ref&gt; Due to clearing of land and building of towns and cities, [[Surface runoff|land runoff]] is accelerated and more nutrients such as [[phosphate]]s and [[nitrate]] are supplied to lakes and rivers, and then to coastal [[estuary|estuaries]] and bays. Extra nutrients are also supplied by treatment plants, golf courses, and agricultural practices through the use of fertilizers. Human activities, including the ones previously listed, can be responsible for an increase in nutrients, therefore, cultural eutrophication is more pronounced in non-polar ecosystems which have higher levels of human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Antoniades|first=Dermot|last2=Michelutti|first2=Neal|last3=Quinlan|first3=Roberto|last4=Blais|first4=Jules M.|last5=Bonilla|first5=Sylvia|last6=Douglas|first6=Marianne S.

One response to added amounts of nutrients in the aquatic ecosystem is the rapid growth of microscopic algae, also known as an [[algal bloom]]. In freshwater systems, the formation of floating algal blooms are commonly nitrogen-fixing [[cyanobacteria]] (blue-green algae).

== Sources of anthropogenic pollution ==

=== Raw sewage ===

The disposal of raw sewage into ocean waters is banned in many countries including the United States, but many developed countries such as Canada continue to pump untreated sewage waste into ocean waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Po-Re/Pollution-of-the-Ocean-by-Sewage-Nutrients-and-Chemicals.html |title=Pollution of the Ocean by Sewage, Nutrients, and Chemicals - river, sea, oceans, percentage, types, system, plants, source, marine, oxygen, human, Pacific |publisher=Waterencyclopedia.com |accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a widespread and highly publicized issue ranging from west coast Victoria, British Columbia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/ocean-floor-death-sewage-victoria-1.3762234 |title=Decades of dumping raw sewage is killing Victoria's ocean floor, diver claims - British Columbia - CBC News |author=Roshini Nair |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2016-09-14 |accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; to east coast Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/sewage-pollution-wastewater-cities-1.3889072 |title=Billions of litres of raw sewage, untreated waste water pouring into Canadian waterways - Politics - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |author=Elizabeth Thompson |date=2016-12-12 |accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===

In order to match an increase in food demand, agricultural production relies heavily on the use of fertilizers to increase overall crop productivity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Jing|last2=Xu|first2=Chang-chun|last3=Ridoutt|first3=Bradley|last4=Wang|first4=Xue-chun|last5=Ren|first5=Pin-an|title=Nitrogen and phosphorus losses and eutrophication potential associated with fertilizer application to cropland in China|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=August 2017|volume=159|pages=171-179|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652617309265?via%3Dihub|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fertilizers contain high amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen, which results in excess amounts of nutrients entering the soil. The nutrients that are not absorbed by the plant leach out of the soil and enter freshwater systems, such as rivers. These nutrients can eventually end up in aquatic ecosystems, and are a contributor to increased eutrophication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:EPIC Systems Demonstration Plant.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration Plant]]

A '''demonstration plant''' is an industrial system used to validate an industrial process for commercialization. It is larger than a [[pilot plant]], and is the final stage in research, development and demonstration of a new process. Demonstration plants are built in a range of sizes, and the term 'demonstration plant' can sometimes be used interchangeably with 'pilot plant.' However, demonstration plants are generally larger than pilot plants are often constructed following a successful trial in a pilot scale size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gertenbach|first1=Dennis|last2=Cooper|first2=Brian|title=SCALEUP ISSUES FROM BENCH TO PILOT|url=http://www.hazenresearch.com/sites/default/files/case-study/scaleup_issues_from_bench_to_pilot.pdf|website=Hazen Research|publisher=AIChE|accessdate=28 March 2016|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstration plants are used to prove a process works at industrial scale, and is financially viable in its intended industry.

==Goals==
The goals of a demonstration plant are generally as follows:
* Prove a new technology using commercially available, pre-tested equipment.
* Show a reasonable [[return on investment]] ROI for the capital that will be invested in a full-scale system, including the operational costs of running such a system.
* In some case, to start bringing product to market in significant enough amounts that production, distribution and target market viability can be established, including finalization of market testing.
* Establish a viable product method that will endure the test of a true manufacturing operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alpert|first1=S.B.|title=DEMONSTRATION PLANTS: ARE THEY NEEDED?|url=https://web.anl.gov/PCS/acsfuel/preprint%20archive/Files/36_1_ATLANTA_04-91_0362.pdf|website=Argonne National Laboratory|publisher=Electric Power Research Institute|accessdate=28 March 2016|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design factors==
Many of the same design techniques that are used for pilot plants are also used when developing demonstration plants. 3D Modeling, chemical similitude studies, mass and energy balances, risk factors, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and mathematical modeling are common techniques used to design demonstration modules before actual fabrication occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schott|first1=John|title=DEMONSTRATION PLANTS|url=https://www.epicmodularprocess.com/systems/pilot-plant/demonstration-plant |website=EPIC Modular Process|publisher=EPIC Systems, Inc.|accessdate=31 May 2016|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emphasis in a demonstration plant is on using industrial equipment, rather than smaller-scale equipment, to prove process viability. A significant amount of product must be produced in equipment that will hold up over a long production lifetime and not be prohibitively expensive. A demonstration plant must show that enough end-product can be created to offset the costs of the commercial system over a period of time.

'''Earthquake engineering''' is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that designs and analyzes structures, such as buildings and bridges, with [[earthquake]]s in mind. Its overall goal is to make such structures more resistant to earthquakes. An earthquake (or seismic) engineer aims to construct structures that will not be damaged in minor shaking and will avoid serious damage or collapse in a major earthquake. Earthquake engineering is the scientific field concerned with protecting society, the natural environment, and the man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to socio-economically acceptable levels.&lt;ref name=Bozorgnia2004&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, it has been narrowly defined as the study of the behavior of structures and geo-structures subject to [[seismic loading]]; it is considered as a subset of [[structural engineering]], [[geotechnical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[applied physics]], etc. However, the tremendous costs experienced in recent earthquakes have led to an expansion of its scope to encompass disciplines from the wider field of [[civil engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]] and from the [[social sciences]], especially [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[economics]] and [[finance]].

The main objectives of earthquake engineering are:
* Foresee the potential consequences of strong [[earthquakes]] on [[urban areas]] and civil infrastructure.
* Design, construct and maintain structures to [[seismic performance|perform]] at earthquake exposure up to the expectations and in compliance with [[building code]]s.&lt;ref name=SeismicDesignCodes&gt;{{cite book|title= Seismic Design Codes and Procedures|author=Berg, Glen V.|year=1983|publisher=EERI|isbn=0-943198-25-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Earthquake engineering structures|properly engineered structure]] does not necessarily have to be extremely strong or expensive. It has to be properly designed to withstand the seismic effects while sustaining an acceptable level of damage.

{{main article|Seismic loading}}

'''Seismic loading''' means application of an earthquake-generated excitation on a structure (or geo-structure). It happens at contact surfaces of a structure either with the ground,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthquake.geoengineer.org/|title=Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering|website=earthquake.geoengineer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; with adjacent structures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civenv.unimelb.edu.au/ejse/Archives/Fulltext/2006/200608.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030041059/http://www.civenv.unimelb.edu.au/ejse/Archives/Fulltext/2006/200608.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or with [[gravity wave]]s from [[tsunami]]. The loading that is expected at a given location on the Earth's surface is estimated by engineering [[seismology]]. It is related to the [[seismic hazard]] of the location.

== Seismic performance ==
{{Main article|Seismic analysis}}

'''Earthquake''' or '''seismic performance''' defines a structure's ability to sustain its main functions, such as its [[safety]] and [[Serviceability (structure)|serviceability]], ''at'' and ''after'' a particular earthquake exposure. A structure is normally considered ''safe'' if it does not endanger the lives and [[well-being]] of those in or around it by partially or completely collapsing. A structure may be considered ''serviceable'' if it is able to fulfill its operational functions for which it was designed.

Basic concepts of the earthquake engineering, implemented in the major building codes, assume that a building should survive a rare, very severe earthquake by sustaining significant damage but without globally collapsing.&lt;ref name=RecommendedLateralForce&gt;{{cite book|title= Recommended Lateral Force Requirements and Commentary|author=Seismology Committee|year=1999|publisher= Structural Engineers Association of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it should remain operational for more frequent, but less severe seismic events.

=== Seismic performance assessment ===

Engineers need to know the quantified level of the actual or anticipated seismic performance associated with the direct damage to an individual building subject to a specified ground shaking.
Such an assessment may be performed either experimentally or analytically.

==== Experimental assessment ====
Experimental evaluations are expensive tests that are typically done by placing a (scaled) model of the structure on a [[earthquake shaking table|shake-table]] that simulates the earth shaking and observing its behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=neesit |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc652Zp5qWk&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=182 |title=Shaking Table Test on Conventional Wooden House (1) |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-11-17 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such kinds of experiments were first performed more than a century ago.&lt;ref name=SeismicExperiments&gt;{{cite book|title= Seismic Experiments on the Fracturing and Overturning of Columns|author=Omori, F.|year=1900|publisher=Publ. Earthquake Invest. Comm. In Foreign Languages, N.4, Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only recently has it become possible to perform 1:1 scale testing on full structures.

Due to the costly nature of such tests, they tend to be used mainly for understanding the seismic behavior of structures, validating models and verifying analysis methods. Thus, once properly validated, computational models and numerical procedures tend to carry the major burden for the seismic performance assessment of structures.

==== Analytical/Numerical assessment ====
[[File:Shaking NDC.jpg|thumb|left|Snapshot from [[shake-table video]] of a 6-story non-ductile concrete building [[destructive testing]]]]

'''Seismic performance assessment''' or [[seismic analysis|seismic structural analysis]] is a powerful tool of earthquake engineering which utilizes detailed modelling of the structure together with methods of structural analysis to gain a better understanding of seismic performance of building and [[non-building structure]]s. The technique as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.

In general, seismic structural analysis is based on the methods of [[structural dynamics]].&lt;ref name=DynamicsOfStructures&gt;{{cite book|title= Dynamics of Structures|author=Chopra, Anil K.|year=1995|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-855214-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For decades, the most prominent instrument of seismic analysis has been the earthquake [[response spectrum]] method which also contributed to the proposed building code's concept of today.&lt;ref name=EarthquakeSpectra&gt;{{cite book|title= Earthquake Spectra and Design|author1=Newmark, N.M. |author2=Hall, W.J. |year=1982|publisher=[[Earthquake Engineering Research Institute|EERI]]|isbn=0-943198-22-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, such methods are good only for linear elastic systems, being largely unable to model the structural behavior when damage (i.e., [[non-linearity]]) appears. Numerical ''step-by-step integration'' proved to be a more effective method of analysis for multi-degree-of-freedom [[structural system]]s with significant [[non-linearity]] under a [[Transient (oscillation)|transient]] process of ground motion excitation.&lt;ref name=DynamicsofStructures&gt;{{cite book|title= Dynamics of Structures|author1=Clough, Ray W. |author2=Penzien, Joseph |year=1993|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-011394-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basically, numerical analysis is conducted in order to evaluate the seismic performance of buildings. Performance evaluations are generally carried out by using nonlinear static pushover analysis or  nonlinear time-history analysis. In such analyses, it is essential to achieve accurate non-linear modeling of structural components such as beams, columns, beam-column joints, shear walls etc. Thus, experimental results play an important role in determining the modeling parameters of individual components, especially those that are subject to significant non-linear deformations. The individual components are then assembled to create a full non-linear model of the structure. Thus created models are analyzed to evaluate the performance of buildings.

The capabilities of the structural analysis software are a major consideration in the above process as they restrict the possible component models, the analysis methods available and, most importantly, the numerical robustness. The latter becomes a major consideration for structures that venture into the non-linear range and approach global or local collapse as the numerical solution becomes increasingly unstable and thus difficult to reach. There are several commercially available Finite Element Analysis software's such as CSI-SAP2000 and CSI-PERFORM-3D and Scia Engineer-ECtools which can be used for the seismic performance evaluation of buildings. Moreover, there is research-based finite element analysis platforms such as [[OpenSees]], RUAUMOKO and the older DRAIN-2D/3D, several of which are now open source.

== Research for earthquake engineering ==

Research for earthquake engineering means both field and analytical investigation or experimentation intended for discovery and scientific explanation of earthquake engineering related facts, revision of conventional concepts in the light of new findings, and practical application of the developed theories.

The [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) is the main United States government agency that supports fundamental research and education in all fields of earthquake engineering. In particular, it focuses on experimental, analytical and computational research on design and performance enhancement of structural systems.[[File:E-Defense Shake Table.jpg|thumb|E-Defense Shake Table&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-mEDsqZK-I&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=660C7AFD70E81C12&amp;index=71 |title=Miki_house_test |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-07-02 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[Earthquake Engineering Research Institute]] (EERI) is a leader in dissemination of [[earthquake engineering research]] related information both in the U.S. and globally.

[[File:Seismic Testing of Crane.jpg|thumb|left|NEES at [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|Buffalo]] testing facility]]

The equipment sites (labs) and a central data repository are connected to the global earthquake engineering community via the NEEShub website.  The NEES website is powered by HUBzero software developed at [[Purdue University]] for [[nanoHUB]] specifically to help the scientific community share resources and collaborate.  The cyberinfrastructure, connected via [[Internet2]], provides interactive simulation tools, a simulation tool development area, a curated central data repository, animated presentations, user support, telepresence, mechanism for uploading and sharing resources, and statistics about users and usage patterns.

This cyberinfrastructure allows researchers to: securely store, organize and share data within a standardized framework in a central location; remotely observe and participate in experiments through the use of synchronized real-time data and video; collaborate with colleagues to facilitate the planning, performance, analysis, and publication of research experiments; and conduct computational and hybrid simulations that may combine the results of multiple distributed experiments and link physical experiments with computer simulations to enable the investigation of overall system performance.

These resources jointly provide the means for collaboration and discovery to improve the seismic design and performance of civil and mechanical infrastructure systems.

=== Earthquake simulation ===

The very first '''earthquake simulations''' were performed by statically applying some ''horizontal inertia forces'' based on [[scale factor|scaled]] [[peak ground acceleration]]s to a mathematical model of a building.&lt;ref name=SeismicDesignOfBuildingStructures&gt;{{cite book|title= Seismic Design of Building Structures|author1=Lindeburg, Michael R. |author2=Baradar, Majid |year=2001|publisher=Professional Publications|isbn=1-888577-52-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the further development of computational technologies, [[statics|static]] approaches began to give way to [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] ones.

Dynamic experiments on building and non-building structures may be physical, like [[Earthquake shaking table|shake-table testing]], or virtual ones. In both cases, to verify a structure's expected seismic performance, some researchers prefer to deal with so called "real time-histories" though the last cannot be "real" for a hypothetical earthquake specified by either a building code or by some particular research requirements. Therefore, there is a strong incentive to engage an earthquake simulation which is the seismic input that possesses only essential features of a real event.

Sometimes earthquake simulation is understood as a re-creation of local effects of a strong earth shaking.

=== Structure simulation ===
[[File:Kinematically equivalent building models on a shake-table.jpg|thumb|Concurrent experiments with two building models which are ''kinematically equivalent'' to a real prototype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvD5D2uhliM |title=Base isolation for earthquake engineering |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Theoretical or experimental evaluation of anticipated seismic performance mostly requires a '''structure simulation''' which is based on the concept of structural likeness or similarity. [[Similitude (model)|Similarity]] is some degree of [[analogy]] or [[Nominalism|resemblance]] between two or more objects. The notion of similarity rests either on exact or approximate repetitions of [[patterns]] in the compared items.

In general, a building model is said to have similarity with the real object if the two share ''geometric similarity'', ''kinematic similarity'' and ''dynamic similarity''. The most vivid and effective type of similarity is the ''kinematic'' one. ''Kinematic similarity'' exists when the paths and velocities of moving particles of a model and its prototype are similar.

The ultimate level of ''kinematic similarity'' is ''kinematic equivalence'' when, in the case of earthquake engineering, time-histories of each story lateral displacements of the model and its prototype would be the same.

== Seismic vibration control ==

'''Seismic vibration control''' is a set of technical means aimed to mitigate seismic impacts in building and [[non-building]] structures. All seismic vibration control  devices may be classified as ''passive'', ''active'' or ''hybrid''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics-animations.com/Physics/English/spri_txt.htm |title=Passive and active vibration isolation systems – Theory |publisher=Physics-animations.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; where:

* ''passive control devices'' have no [[feedback]] capability between them, structural elements and the ground;
* ''[[Active vibration control|active control devices]]'' incorporate real-time recording instrumentation on the ground integrated with earthquake input processing equipment and [[actuator]]s within the structure;
* ''hybrid control devices'' have combined features of active and passive control systems.&lt;ref name=ActiveHybrid&gt;{{cite book|title= Active, Hybrid and Semi-Active Structural Control|author1=Chu, S.Y. |author2=Soong, T.T. |author3=Reinhorn, A.M. |year=2005|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=0-470-01352-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ground [[seismic waves]] reach up and start to penetrate a base of a building, their energy flow density, due to reflections, reduces dramatically: usually, up to 90%. However, the remaining portions of the incident waves during a major earthquake still bear a huge devastating potential.

After the seismic waves enter a [[superstructure]], there are a number of ways to control them in order to soothe their damaging effect and improve the building's seismic performance, for instance:

[[File:Cyrus tomb.jpg|thumb|[[Mausoleum]] of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], the oldest [[base isolation|base-isolated]] structure in the world]]
Devices of the last kind, abbreviated correspondingly as TMD for the tuned (''passive''), as AMD for the ''active'', and as HMD for the ''hybrid mass dampers'', have been studied and installed in [[high-rise building]]s, predominantly in Japan, for a quarter of a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.takenaka.co.jp/takenaka_e/quake_e/seishin/seishin.htm|title=想いをかたちに 未来へつなぐ　竹中工務店|website=www.takenaka.co.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is quite another approach: partial suppression of the seismic energy flow into the [[superstructure]] known as seismic or [[base isolation]].

For this, some pads are inserted into or under all major load-carrying elements in the base of the building which should substantially decouple a [[superstructure]] from its [[Substructure (engineering)|substructure]] resting on a shaking ground.

The first evidence of earthquake protection by using the principle of base isolation was discovered in [[Pasargadae]], a city in ancient Persia, now Iran, and dates back to the 6th century BCE. Below, there are some samples of seismic vibration control technologies of today.

=== Dry-stone walls control ===
[[File:Machupicchu intihuatana.JPG|thumb|left|Dry-stone walls of [[Machu Picchu]] Temple of the Sun, [[Peru]]]]People of [[Inca civilization]] were masters of the polished 'dry-stone walls', called [[ashlar]], where blocks of stone were cut to fit together tightly without any [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. The Incas were among the best stonemasons the world has ever seen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/inca1/qanda.html |title=Live Event Q&amp;As |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many junctions in their masonry were so perfect that even blades of grass could not fit between the stones.

[[Peru]] is a highly [[seismic]] land and for centuries the mortar-free [[construction]] proved to be apparently more earthquake-resistant than using mortar. The stones of the dry-stone walls built by the Incas could move slightly and resettle without the walls collapsing, a passive [[vibration control|structural control]] technique employing both the principle of energy dissipation (coulomb damping) and that of suppressing [[resonant]] amplifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/easter/civilization/first.html |title=Clark, Liesl; "First Inhabitants"; PBS online, Nova; updated Nov. 2000 |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tuned mass damper ===
{{Main article|Tuned mass damper}}
[[File:Taipei 101 Tuned Mass Damper.png|thumb|left|[[Tuned mass damper]] in [[Taipei 101]], the world's third tallest [[skyscraper]]]]

Typically the [[tuned mass damper]]s are huge concrete blocks mounted in [[skyscraper]]s or other structures and move in opposition to the [[resonance frequency]] oscillations of the structures by means of some sort of spring mechanism.

The [[Taipei 101]] skyscraper needs to withstand [[typhoon]] winds and earthquake [[tremor]]s common in this area of Asia/Pacific. For this purpose, a steel [[pendulum]] weighing 660 metric tonnes that serves as a tuned mass damper was designed and installed atop the structure. Suspended from the 92nd to the 88th floor, the pendulum sways to decrease resonant amplifications of lateral displacements in the building caused by earthquakes and strong [[Wind|gusts]].

=== Hysteretic dampers ===
A '''hysteretic damper''' is intended to provide better and more reliable seismic performance than that of a conventional structure by increasing the dissipation of [[seismic loading|seismic input]] energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.structuremag.org/OldArchives/2004/july/Structural%20Practices.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514012858/http://www.structuremag.org/OldArchives/2004/july/Structural%20Practices.pdf |date=May 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are five major groups of hysteretic dampers used for the purpose, namely:

:* '''Fluid viscous dampers (FVDs)'''
Viscous Dampers have the benefit of being a supplemental damping system. They have an oval hysteretic loop and the damping is velocity dependent. While some minor maintenance is potentially required, viscous dampers generally do not need to be replaced after an earthquake. While more expensive than other damping technologies they can be used for both seismic and wind loads and are the most commonly used hysteretic damper.

:* '''Friction dampers (FDs)'''
Friction dampers tend to be available in two major types, linear and rotational and dissipate energy by heat. The damper operates on the principle of a [[Coulomb damping|coulomb damper]]. Depending on the design, friction dampers can experience [[stick-slip phenomenon]] and [[Cold welding]]. The main disadvantage being that friction surfaces can wear over time and for this reason they are not recommended for dissipating wind loads. When used in seismic applications wear is not a problem and there is no required maintenance. They have a rectangular hysteretic loop and as long as the building is sufficiently elastic they tend to settle back to their original positions after an earthquake.

:* '''Metallic yielding dampers (MYDs)'''
Metallic yielding dampers, as the name implies, yield in order to absorb the earthquake's energy. This type of damper absorbs a large amount of energy however they must be replaced after an earthquake and may prevent the building from settling back to its original position.

:* '''Viscoelastic dampers (VEDs)'''
Viscoelastic dampers are useful in that they can be used for both wind and seismic applications, they are usually limited to small displacements. There is some concern as to the reliability of the technology as some brands have been banned from use in buildings in the United States.

:* '''Straddling pendulum dampers (swing)'''

=== Base isolation ===
Base isolation seeks to prevent the kinetic energy of the earthquake from being transferred into elastic energy in the building. These technologies do so by isolating the structure from the ground, thus enabling them to move somewhat independently. The degree to which the energy is transferred into the structure and how the energy is dissipated will vary depending on the technology used.

:* '''Lead rubber bearing'''
[[File:LRBtest.jpg|thumb|LRB being tested at the [[UCSD]] Caltrans-SRMD facility]]

Lead rubber bearing or LRB is a type of [[base isolation]] employing a heavy [[damping]].  It was invented by [[William Robinson (scientist)|Bill Robinson]], a New Zealander.&lt;ref name="teara.govt.nz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/earthquakes/4 |title=4. Building for earthquake resistance – Earthquakes – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy damping mechanism incorporated in [[vibration control]] technologies and, particularly, in base isolation devices, is often considered a valuable source of suppressing vibrations thus enhancing a building's seismic performance. However, for the rather pliant systems such as base isolated structures, with a relatively low bearing stiffness but with a high damping, the so-called "damping force" may turn out the main pushing force at a strong earthquake.  The video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=neesit |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yXgu4aS8HE |title=LBRtest |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-07-10 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows a Lead Rubber Bearing being tested at the [[UCSD]] Caltrans-SRMD facility. The bearing is made of rubber with a lead core. It was a uniaxial test in which the bearing was also under a full structure load. Many buildings and bridges, both in New Zealand and elsewhere, are protected with lead dampers and lead and rubber bearings. [[Te Papa Tongarewa]], the national museum of New Zealand, and the New Zealand [[The Beehive|Parliament Buildings]] have been fitted with the bearings. Both are in [[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]] which sits on an [[active fault]].&lt;ref name="teara.govt.nz"/&gt;

:* '''Springs-with-damper base isolator'''
[[File:GERB spring with damper.jpg|thumb|Springs-with-damper close-up]]

Springs-with-damper base isolator installed under a three-story town-house, [[Santa Monica]], California is shown on the photo taken prior to the 1994 [[Northridge earthquake]] exposure. It is a [[base isolation]] device conceptually similar to ''Lead Rubber Bearing''.

One of two three-story town-houses like this, which was well instrumented for recording of both vertical and horizontal [[acceleration]]s on its floors and the ground, has survived a severe shaking during the [[Northridge earthquake]] and left  valuable recorded information for further study.

:* '''Simple roller bearing'''
Simple roller bearing is a [[base isolation]] device which is intended for protection of various building and non-building structures against potentially damaging [[seismic loading|lateral impacts]] of strong earthquakes.

This metallic bearing support may be adapted, with certain precautions, as a seismic isolator to skyscrapers and buildings on soft ground. Recently, it has been employed under the name of ''[[metallic roller bearing]]'' for a housing complex (17 stories) in [[Tokyo, Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okumuragumi.co.jp/en/technology/building.html |title=Building Technology + Seismic Isolation System – Okumura Corporation |language=ja |publisher=Okumuragumi.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* '''Friction pendulum bearing'''

== Seismic design ==

'''Seismic design''' is based on authorized engineering procedures, principles and criteria meant to [[design]] or [[seismic retrofit|retrofit]] structures subject to earthquake exposure.&lt;ref name=SeismicDesignOfBuildingStructures/&gt; Those criteria are only consistent with the contemporary state of the knowledge about [[earthquake engineering structures]].&lt;ref name=EarthquakeDesignCriteria&gt;{{cite book|title= Earthquake Design Criteria|author1=Housner, George W. |author2=Jennings, Paul C. |year=1982|publisher=EERI|isbn=1-888577-52-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a building design which exactly follows seismic code regulations does not guarantee safety against collapse or serious damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nisee.berkeley.edu/bertero/html/earthquake-resistant_construction.html |title=Earthquake-Resistant Construction |publisher=Nisee.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915091405/http://nisee.berkeley.edu/bertero/html/earthquake-resistant_construction.html |archivedate=2012-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of poor seismic design may be enormous. Nevertheless, seismic design has always been a [[trial and error]] process whether it was based on physical laws or on empirical knowledge of the [[seismic performance|structural performance]] of different shapes and materials.

[[File:San Francisco in ruins view from Captive Airship above Folsom 1906.jpg|thumb|[[San Francisco]] after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]] and fire]]
To practice [[seismic design]], seismic analysis or seismic evaluation of new and existing civil engineering projects, an [[engineer]] should, normally, pass examination on ''Seismic Principles''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pels.ca.gov/applicants/plan_civseism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which, in the State of California, include:
* Seismic Data and Seismic Design Criteria
* Seismic Characteristics of Engineered Systems
* Seismic Forces
* Seismic Analysis Procedures
* Seismic Detailing and Construction Quality Control

To build up complex structural systems,&lt;ref name=SeismicDesignHandbook&gt;{{cite book|title=Seismic Design Handbook|author=Edited by Farzad Naeim|year=1989|publisher=VNR|isbn=0-442-26922-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; seismic design largely uses the same relatively small number of basic structural elements (to say nothing of vibration control devices) as any non-seismic design project.

Normally, according to building codes, structures are designed to "withstand" the largest earthquake of a certain probability that is likely to occur at their location. This means the loss of life should be minimized by preventing collapse of the buildings.

Seismic design is carried out by understanding the possible [[failure mode]]s of a structure and providing the structure with appropriate [[Strength of materials|strength]], [[stiffness]], [[ductility]], and [[configuration (geometry)|configuration]]&lt;ref name=BuildingConfiguration&gt;{{cite book|title= Building Configuration &amp; Seismic Design|author1=Arnold, Christopher |author2=Reitherman, Robert |year=1982|publisher=A Wiley-Interscience Publication|isbn=0-471-86138-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure those modes cannot occur.

=== Seismic design requirements ===
'''Seismic design requirements''' depend on the type of the structure, locality of the project and its authorities which stipulate applicable seismic design codes and criteria.&lt;ref name="RecommendedLateralForce"/&gt; For instance, [[California Department of Transportation]]'s requirements called ''The Seismic Design Criteria'' (SDC) and aimed at the design of new bridges in California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/earthquake_engineering/SDC/SDCPage.html |title=Template for External Caltrans Pages |publisher=Dot.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporate an innovative seismic performance-based approach.

[[File:Metsamor aerien.jpg|thumb|The [[Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant]] was closed after the [[1988 Armenian earthquake]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asbarez.com/2007/12/07/strategy-to-close-metsamor-plant-presented |title=Strategy to Close Metsamor Plant Presented &amp;#124; Asbarez Armenian News |publisher=Asbarez.com |date=1995-10-26 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]The most significant feature in the SDC design philosophy is a shift from a ''force-based assessment'' of seismic demand to a ''displacement-based assessment'' of demand and capacity. Thus, the newly adopted displacement approach is based on comparing the ''elastic displacement'' demand to the ''inelastic displacement'' capacity of the primary structural components while ensuring a minimum level of inelastic capacity at all potential plastic hinge locations.

In addition to the designed structure itself, seismic design requirements may include a ''ground stabilization'' underneath the structure: sometimes, heavily shaken ground breaks up which leads to collapse of the structure sitting upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=neesit |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d316Wdgf16Y&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=63 |title=Niigita Earthquake 1964 – YouTube |publisher=www.youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following topics should be of primary concerns: liquefaction; dynamic lateral earth pressures on retaining walls; seismic slope stability; earthquake-induced settlement.&lt;ref name=GeoEarthquakeEngineering&gt;{{cite book|title= Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering Handbook|author=Robert W. Day|year=2007|publisher= McGraw Hill|isbn=0-07-137782-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuclear facility|Nuclear facilities]] should not jeopardise their safety in case of earthquakes or other hostile external events. Therefore, their seismic design is based on criteria far more stringent than those applying to non-nuclear facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf18.html |title=Nuclear Power Plants and Earthquakes |publisher=World-nuclear.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] and [[2011 Japanese nuclear incidents|damage to other nuclear facilities]] that followed the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] have, however, drawn attention to ongoing concerns over [[Nuclear power in Japan#Seismicity|Japanese nuclear seismic design standards]] and caused other many governments to [[International reaction to Fukushima I nuclear accidents#Re-evaluation of existing nuclear energy programs|re-evaluate their nuclear programs]]. Doubt has also been expressed over the seismic evaluation and design of certain other plants, including the [[Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant]] in France.

=== Failure modes ===

'''Failure mode''' is the manner by which an earthquake induced failure is observed. It, generally, describes the way the failure occurs. Though costly and time consuming, learning from each real earthquake failure remains a routine recipe for advancement in ''seismic design'' methods. Below, some typical modes of earthquake-generated failures are presented.

[[File:LomaPrieta-SOMA.jpeg|thumb|left|Typical damage to [[unreinforced masonry building]]s at earthquakes]]
The lack of [[rebar|reinforcement]] coupled with poor [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and inadequate roof-to-wall ties can result in substantial damage to an '''unreinforced masonry building'''. Severely cracked or leaning walls are some of the most common earthquake damage. Also hazardous is the damage that may occur between the walls and roof or floor diaphragms. Separation between the framing and the walls can jeopardize the vertical support of roof and floor systems.

[[File:LomaPrieta-Marina.jpeg|thumb|[[Soft story building|Soft story]] collapse due to inadequate shear strength at ground level, [[Loma Prieta earthquake]]]]
'''[[Soft story building|Soft story effect]]'''. Absence of adequate stiffness on the ground level caused damage to this structure. A close examination of the image reveals that the rough board siding, once covered by a [[brick veneer]], has been completely dismantled from the studwall. Only the [[Structural rigidity|rigidity]] of the floor above combined with the support on the two hidden sides by continuous walls, not penetrated with large doors as on the street sides, is preventing full collapse of the structure.

[[File:Liquefaction at Niigata.JPG|thumb|left|Effects of [[soil liquefaction]] during the [[1964 Niigata earthquake]]]]
'''[[Soil liquefaction]]'''. In the cases where the soil consists of loose granular deposited materials with the tendency to develop excessive hydrostatic pore water pressure of sufficient magnitude and compact, [[liquefaction]] of those loose saturated deposits may result in non-uniform [[Consolidation (soil)|settlements]] and tilting of structures. This caused major damage to thousands of buildings in Niigata, Japan during the [[1964 Niigata earthquake|1964 earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=neesit |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d316Wdgf16Y&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=63 |title=Niigita Earthquake 1964 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Smashed Car in Dujiangyan - 2008 Sichuan earthquake (1).jpg|thumb|Car smashed by [[landslide]] rock, [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]]]]
'''Landslide rock fall'''. A [[landslide]] is a geological phenomenon which includes a wide range of ground movement, including '''rock falls'''. Typically, the action of [[gravity]] is the primary driving force for a landslide to occur though in this case there was another contributing factor which affected the original [[slope stability]]: the landslide required an ''earthquake trigger'' before being released.

[[File:St.Joseph'sSeminary Los Altos USGS.jpg|thumb|left|Effects of pounding against adjacent building, [[Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta]]]]
'''Pounding against adjacent building'''. This is a photograph of the collapsed five-story tower, St. Joseph's Seminary, [[Los Altos, California]] which resulted in one fatality. During [[Loma Prieta earthquake]], the tower pounded against the independently vibrating adjacent building behind. A possibility of pounding depends on both buildings' lateral displacements which should be accurately estimated and accounted for.

[[File:Kaiser Permanente Building After Northridge Earthquake.jpg|thumb|Effects of completely shattered joints of concrete frame, [[Northridge earthquake|Northridge]]]]
At [[Northridge earthquake]], the Kaiser Permanente concrete frame office building had joints completely shattered, revealing '''inadequate confinement steel''', which resulted in the second story collapse. In the transverse direction, composite end [[shear wall]]s, consisting of two [[wythe]]s of brick and a layer of [[shotcrete]] that carried the lateral load, peeled apart because of '''inadequate through-ties''' and failed.

* Improper [[construction site]] on a [[foothill]].
* Poor detailing of the [[rebar|reinforcement]] (lack of concrete confinement in the columns and at the beam-column joints, inadequate splice length).
* Seismically weak [[soft story building|soft story]] at the first floor.
* Long [[cantilever]]s with heavy [[dead load]].

[[File:Ground failure.jpeg|thumb|''Lateral spreading'' mode of ground failure, [[Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta]]]]
Ground shaking triggered [[soil liquefaction]] in a subsurface layer of [[sand]], producing differential lateral and vertical movement in an overlying [[carapace]] of unliquified sand and [[silt]]. This '''mode of ground failure''', termed '''lateral spreading''', is a principal cause of liquefaction-related earthquake damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlSuosOTAV0&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=660C7AFD70E81C12&amp;index=53&amp;playnext=2&amp;playnext_from=PL |title=Soil Liquefaction with Dr. Ellen Rathje |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earthquake-resistant construction ==

'''Earthquake construction''' means implementation of '''seismic design''' to enable building and non-building structures to live through the anticipated earthquake exposure up to the expectations and in compliance with the applicable [[building code]]s.[[File:2009 03 03 Pearl River Tower.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of [[Pearl River Tower]] X-bracing to resist lateral forces of earthquakes and winds]]

Design and construction are intimately related. To achieve a good workmanship, detailing of the members and their connections should be as simple as possible. As any construction in general, earthquake construction is a process that consists of the building, retrofitting or assembling of infrastructure given the construction materials available.&lt;ref name=BridgeDesign&gt;{{cite book|title=Bridge Design, Construction and Maintenance
|author=Edited by Robert Lark|year=2007|publisher=Thomas Telford|isbn=0-7277-3593-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destabilizing action of an earthquake on constructions may be ''direct'' (seismic motion of the ground) or ''indirect'' (earthquake-induced landslides, [[soil liquefaction]] and waves of tsunami).

A structure might have all the appearances of stability, yet offer nothing but danger when an earthquake occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24993357/ |title=Bad construction cited in quake zone – World news – Asia-Pacific – China earthquake &amp;#124; NBC News |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crucial fact is that, for safety, earthquake-resistant construction techniques are as important as [[quality control]] and using correct materials. ''Earthquake contractor'' should be [[registered company|registered]] in the state/province/country of the project location (depending on local regulations), [[bond (finance)|bonded]] and [[insured]] {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}.

To minimize possible [[earthquake loss|losses]], construction process should be organized with keeping in mind that earthquake may strike any time prior to the end of construction.

Each [[construction project]] requires a qualified team of professionals who understand the basic features of seismic performance of different structures as well as [[construction management]].

=== Adobe structures ===
[[File:Adobe structure.jpg|thumb|Partially collapsed adobe building in Westmorland, [[California]]]]

Around thirty percent of the world's population lives or works in earth-made construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eartharchitecture.org/|title=Earth Architecture – the Book, Synopsis|accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe]] type of [[mud brick]]s is one of the oldest and most widely used building materials. The use of [[adobe]] is very common in some of the world's most hazard-prone regions, traditionally across Latin America, Africa, Indian subcontinent and other parts of Asia, Middle East and Southern Europe.

Adobe buildings are considered very vulnerable at strong quakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOiqGHEOmuA&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=16 |title=simulacion terremoto peru-huaraz – casas de adobe – YouTube |publisher=Nz.youtube.com |date=2006-06-24 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, multiple ways of seismic strengthening of new and existing adobe buildings are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-housing.net/uploads/WHETutorial_Adobe_English.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828211041/http://www.world-housing.net/uploads/WHETutorial_Adobe_English.pdf |date=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key factors for the improved seismic performance of
adobe construction are:

=== Limestone and sandstone structures ===
[[File:SLCCityAndCountyBldg.jpg|thumb|left|Base-isolated City and County Building, [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]]]

[[Limestone]] is very common in architecture, especially in North America and Europe. Many landmarks across the world are made of limestone. Many medieval churches and castles in Europe are made of [[limestone]] and [[sandstone]] masonry. They are the long-lasting materials but their rather heavy weight is not beneficial for adequate seismic performance.

Application of modern technology to seismic retrofitting can enhance the survivability of unreinforced masonry structures. As an example, from 1973 to 1989, the [[Salt Lake City and County Building]] in [[Utah]] was exhaustively renovated and repaired with an emphasis on preserving historical accuracy in appearance. This was done in concert with a seismic upgrade that placed the weak sandstone structure on base isolation foundation to better protect it from earthquake damage.

=== Timber frame structures ===
[[File:Anne Hvides Gaard Svendborg.jpg|thumb|[[Anne Hvide's House]], Denmark (1560)]]

[[Timber framing]] dates back thousands of years, and has been used in many parts of the world during various periods such as ancient Japan, Europe and medieval England in localities where timber was in good supply and building stone and the skills to work it were not.

The use of [[timber framing]] in buildings provides their complete skeletal framing which offers some structural benefits as the timber frame, if properly engineered, lends itself to better ''seismic survivability''.&lt;ref name=Timber&gt;{{cite book|title= Timber Design &amp; Construction Sourcebook=Gotz, Karl-Heinz et al.|year=1989|publisher=McGraw-Hall |isbn=0-07-023851-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light-frame structures ===
[[File:Wood-framed house.jpg|thumb|left|A two-story wooden-frame for a residential building structure]]

[[Light-frame construction|Light-frame structures]] usually gain seismic resistance from rigid [[plywood]] shear walls and wood structural panel [[diaphragm (structural system)|diaphragms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nees.buffalo.edu/projects/NEESWood/video.asp |title=SEESL |publisher=Nees.buffalo.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special provisions for seismic load-resisting systems for all [[engineered wood]] structures requires consideration of diaphragm ratios, horizontal and vertical diaphragm shears, and [[Gender of connectors and fasteners|connector]]/[[fastener]] values. In addition, collectors, or drag struts, to distribute shear along a diaphragm length are required.

=== Reinforced masonry structures ===
[[File:Bond-beam.JPG|thumb|Reinforced hollow masonry wall]]

A construction system where [[steel reinforcement]] is embedded in the [[mortar joint]]s of [[masonry]] or placed in holes and after filled with [[concrete]] or [[grout]] is called '''reinforced masonry'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rossen Rashkoff |url=http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/earthquakes/MasonryBrick/ReinforcedBrickMasonry.htm |title=Reinforced Brick Masonry |publisher=Staff.city.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819014216/http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/earthquakes/MasonryBrick/ReinforcedBrickMasonry.htm |archivedate=2013-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The devastating [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]] revealed that masonry construction should be improved immediately. Then, the California State Code made the reinforced masonry mandatory.

There are various practices and techniques to achieve reinforced masonry. The most common type is the reinforced hollow unit masonry. The effectiveness of both vertical and horizontal reinforcement strongly depends on the type and quality of the masonry, i.e. masonry units and [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]].

To achieve a [[ductile]] behavior of masonry, it is necessary that the [[shear strength]] of the wall is greater than the [[flexural strength]].&lt;ref name=SeismicMasonry&gt;{{cite book|title= Seismic Design of Masonry Using the 1997 UBC|author1=Ekwueme, Chukwuma G. |author2=Uzarski, Joe |year=2003|publisher=Concrete Masonry Association of California and Nevada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reinforced concrete structures ===
[[File:StressedRibbonBridgeUnderside7138.JPG|thumb|left|Stressed Ribbon pedestrian bridge over the Rogue River, Grants Pass, [[Oregon]]]]
[[File:ThreeTwrBrCenter.jpg|thumb|left|Prestressed concrete [[cable-stayed bridge]] over [[Yangtze river]]]]

[[Reinforced concrete]] is concrete in which steel reinforcement bars ([[rebars]]) or [[fiber]]s have been incorporated to strengthen a material that would otherwise be [[brittle]]. It can be used to produce [[Beam (structure)|beams]], [[column]]s, floors or bridges.

[[Prestressed concrete]] is a kind of [[reinforced concrete]] used for overcoming concrete's natural weakness in tension. It can be applied to [[beams]], floors or bridges with a longer span than is practical with ordinary reinforced concrete. Prestressing [[tendon]]s (generally of high tensile steel cable or rods) are used to provide a clamping load which produces a [[compressive stress]] that offsets the [[tensile stress]] that the concrete [[compression member]] would, otherwise, experience due to a bending load.

To prevent catastrophic collapse in response earth shaking (in the interest of life safety), a traditional reinforced concrete frame should have [[ductile]] joints. Depending upon the methods used and the imposed seismic forces, such buildings may be immediately usable, require extensive repair, or may have to be demolished.

=== Prestressed structures ===
[[Prestressed structure]] is the one whose overall [[integrity]], [[Structural stability|stability]] and [[security]] depend, primarily, on a ''prestressing''. ''Prestressing'' means the intentional creation of permanent stresses in a structure for the purpose of improving its performance under various service conditions.&lt;ref name=PrestressedConcreteDesign&gt;{{cite book|title= Design of Prestressed Concrete|author=Nilson, Arthur H.|year=1987|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-83072-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman Colosseum With Moon.jpg|thumb|Naturally pre-compressed exterior wall of [[Colosseum]], Rome]]
There are the following basic types of prestressing:
* Pre-compression (mostly, with the own weight of a structure)
* [[Prestressed concrete|Pretensioning]] with high-strength embedded tendons
* [[Prestressed concrete|Post-tensioning]] with high-strength bonded or unbonded tendons
Today, the concept of [[prestressed structure]] is widely engaged in design of [[building]]s, underground structures, TV towers, power stations, floating storage and offshore facilities, [[nuclear reactor]] vessels, and numerous kinds of [[bridge]] systems.&lt;ref name=PrestressedConcrete&gt;{{cite book|title= Prestressed Concrete|author=Nawy, Edward G.|year=1989|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-698375-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A beneficial idea of ''prestressing'' was, apparently, familiar to the ancient Rome architects; look, e.g., at the tall [[attic]] wall of [[Colosseum]] working as a stabilizing device for the wall [[pier]]s beneath.

=== Steel structures ===
[[File:LomaPrieta-BayBridge-collapsed-section.jpeg|thumb|Collapsed section of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]] in response to [[Loma Prieta earthquake]]]]

'''Steel structures''' are considered mostly earthquake resistant but some failures have occurred. A great number of welded [[steel moment-resisting frame]] buildings, which looked earthquake-proof, surprisingly experienced brittle behavior and were hazardously damaged in the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]].&lt;ref name=Reitherman&gt;{{cite book|last=Reitherman|first=Robert|title=Earthquakes and Engineers: An International History|year=2012|publisher=ASCE Press|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784410714|pages=394–395|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726183407/http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877|archivedate=2012-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) initiated development of repair techniques and new design approaches to minimize damage to steel moment frame buildings in future earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacsteel.org/index.html |title=SAC Steel Project: Welcome |publisher=Sacsteel.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[structural steel]] seismic design based on [[Load and Resistance Factor Design]] (LRFD) approach, it is very important to assess ability of a structure to develop and maintain its bearing resistance in the [[inelastic]] range. A measure of this ability is [[ductility]], which may be observed in a ''material itself'', in a ''structural element'', or to a ''whole structure''.

As a consequence of [[Northridge earthquake]] experience, the American Institute of Steel Construction has introduced AISC 358 "Pre-Qualified Connections for Special and intermediate Steel Moment Frames."  The AISC Seismic Design Provisions require that all [[Steel Moment Resisting Frame]]s employ either connections contained in AISC 358, or the use of connections that have been subjected to pre-qualifying cyclic testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seismic Design Manual|year=2006|publisher=American Institute of Steel Construction|location=Chicago|isbn=1-56424-056-8|pages=6.1–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prediction of earthquake losses ==

'''Earthquake loss estimation''' is usually defined as a ''Damage Ratio'' ('''DR''') which is a ratio of the earthquake damage repair cost to the [[Total Economic Value|total value]] of a building.&lt;ref name=SeismicRisk&gt;{{cite book|title= Financial Management of Earthquake Risk|author=EERI Endowment Subcommittee|date=May 2000|publisher=EERI Publication|isbn=0-943198-21-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Probable Maximum Loss'' ('''PML''') is a common term used for earthquake loss estimation, but it lacks a precise definition.  In 1999, ASTM E2026 'Standard Guide for the Estimation of Building Damageability in Earthquakes' was produced in order to standardize the nomenclature for seismic loss estimation, as well as establish guidelines as to the review process and qualifications of the reviewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cccengr.com/cccengerwebpage_lossestimation.html|year=1999|title=Loss Estimation|author=Eugene Trahern|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410060435/http://www.cccengr.com/cccengerwebpage_lossestimation.html|archivedate=2009-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earthquake loss estimations are also referred to as ''Seismic Risk Assessments''.  The risk assessment process generally involves determining the probability of various ground motions coupled with the vulnerability or damage of the building under those ground motions.  The results are defined as a percent of building replacement value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Acceptable Risk Processes: Lifeline and Natural Hazards|year=2002|publisher=ASCE, TCLEE|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784406236|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147486137&amp;productid=5260|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130113010823/http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147486137&amp;productid=5260|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-13|editor1=Craig Taylor|editor2=Erik VanMarcke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5698">'''Ecopoetry''' is [[poetry]] with a strong [[ecological]] emphasis or message. Many [[poets]], [[poems]] and books of poems have expressed ecological concerns; but only recently has the term ''ecopoetry'' gained use.  There is now, in English-speaking poetry, a recognisable sub[[genre]] of ecopoetry.

Prior to the term, a number of poems had ecological messages. Although these poets did not mention the word, they were clearly 'Ecopoetic' in stance and exerted an influence on the subsequent subgenre.  Examples include: ''The White Poem'' by Jay Ramsay &amp; Carole Bruce (Rivelin Grapheme Press, 1988), ''Bosco'' (Hearing Eye, 1999; 2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=authC2D9C28B0c54816E6EhGs14087F4 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203183320/http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=authC2D9C28B0c54816E6EhGs14087F4 |archivedate=2007-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and (more recently) ''Heavy Water: a poem for Chernobyl'' (Enitharmon Press, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enitharmon.co.uk/books/viewBook.asp?BID=97 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822000957/http://www.enitharmon.co.uk/books/viewBook.asp?BID=97 |archivedate=2007-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of a number of seminal texts helping to introduce the term into wider, critical use was ''Ecopoetry: a Critical Introduction'' edited by J. Scott Bryson (2002).  Another example of the burgeoning use of the term at the millennial turn was the journal ''[[Ecopoetics (journal)|Ecopoetics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecopoetics.org/ ''Ecopoetics'']&lt;/ref&gt; which broadened the term from poetry into ''[[poiesis]]'' interpreted as making or writing more generally.

Since then, a spate of poetry anthologies and books has appeared, either employing the word explicitly or using the idea as a guiding principle.  Recent instances include [[Alice Oswald]]'s ''The Thunder Mutters'' (2005), [[Forrest Gander]] &amp; John Kinsella's ''Redstart: an Ecological Poetics'', and the ground-breaking ''Earth Shattering: Ecopoems'', edited by [[Neil Astley]] at [[Bloodaxe Books]] (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/titlepage.asp?isbn=1852247746 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818111930/http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/titlepage.asp?isbn=1852247746 |archivedate=2007-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the chief characteristics of ecopoetry, as defined by James Engelhardt, is that it is connected to the world in a way that implies responsibility.  As with other models that explore and assume engagement ([[Marxism]], [[feminism]], etc.), Ecopoetry is "surrounded by questions of ethics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.octopusmagazine.com/issue09/engelhardt.htm|title=Welcome octopusmagazine.com - BlueHost.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a means of describing poetry or poetic projects that embrace the ecological imperative for personal sensitivity and social change, ecopoetry has been cited by such writers as [[John Burnside (writer)|John Burnside]] and [[Mario Petrucci]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archive.poetrysociety.org.uk/content/poetry-class&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3737">'''Field-induced polymer electroluminescent (FIPEL) technology''' is a low power electroluminescent light source. Three layers of moldable light-emitting [[polymer]] blended with a small amount of [[carbon nanotube]]s glow when an alternating current is passed through them.

FIPEL lights are different from LED lighting, in that there is no junction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4363">'''Floristic Quality Assessment''' (FQA) is a tool used to assess an area's ecological integrity based on its plant species composition.&lt;ref name=fqa95&gt;{{cite report |first1=Gerould |last1=Wilhelm |authorlink1=Gerould Wilhelm |first2=Linda |last2=Masters |authorlink2=Linda Masters |date=June 1995 |title=Floristic Quality Assessment in the Chicago Region and Application Computer Programs |url= |publisher=The Morton Arboretum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Floristic Quality Assessment was originally developed in order to assess the likelihood that impacts to an area "would be irreversible or irretrievable...enabling planners, land managers, applied ecologists, and other practitioners to make standard comparisons among various open land areas, to set [[conservation (ethic)| conservation]] priorities, and to monitor site management or [[habitat restoration|restoration]] efforts."&lt;ref name=swink94&gt;{{cite book |last1=Swink |first1=Floyd |authorlink1=Floyd Swink |last2=Wilhelm |first2=Gerould  |date=1994 |title=Plants of the Chicago Region}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was developed by [[Gerould Wilhelm]] in the 1970s in a report on the natural lands of [[Kane County, Illinois]]&lt;ref name=wilhelm77&gt;{{cite report |first1=Gerould S. |last1=Wilhelm |date=1977 |title=Ecological assessment of open land areas in Kane County, Illinois |url= |publisher=Kane County Urban Development Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; and codified for the Chicago Region in 1979.&lt;ref name=swink79&gt;{{cite book |last1=Swink |first1=Floyd |last2=Wilhelm |first2=Gerould |date=1979 |title=Plants of the Chicago Region}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Coefficient of Conservatism ==
Each plant species in a region is assigned a '''coefficient of conservatism''', also known as a C-value, ranging between 0 and 10.&lt;ref name=fqa95 /&gt; A plant species with a higher score (e.g. 10) has a ''lower'' tolerance to [[environmental degradation]] such as [[grazing]] or [[land development|development]] and therefore is naturally restricted to undisturbed, [[remnant natural area|remnant habitats]]. Non-native plants are either assigned a C-value of 0 or are excluded from assessments.&lt;ref name=freyman16&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Freyman |first1=William A. |last2=Master |first2=Linda A. |last3=Packard |first3=Stephen |date=2016 |title=The Universal Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) Calculator: an online tool for ecological assessment and monitoring |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12491/abstract |journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution |volume=7 |issue= |pages=380-383 |doi=10.1111/2041-210X.12491 |access-date=2018-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Chicago Region, 84% of the native plant species have a C-value of 4 or greater.&lt;ref name=FCR17&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilhelm |first1=Gerould |last2=Rericha |first2=Laura |authorlink2=Laura Rericha |date=2017 |title=Flora of the Chicago Region: A Floristic and Ecological Synthesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants with a C-value of 4 or greater rarely naturally move from a remnant area to surrounding degraded land.&lt;ref name=FCR17 /&gt;

C-values are assigned within specific ecological and geographic regions. As of February 2018, there were at least 50 different FQA databases ranging from the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] to western [[Washington (state)|Washington]], though most databases represented regions in the eastern and central United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=universalfqa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://universalfqa.org |title=Universal FQA|date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mean C-value''' (&lt;math&gt; \bar{C}&lt;/math&gt;) is calculated based on an inventory of plants. An area with a native mean C-value of 3.5  or higher likely has "sufficient floristic quality to be of at least marginal natural area quality."&lt;ref name=swink94 /&gt; Remnant natural areas with mean C-values of 4.0 or greater are [[environmental mitigation|unmitigable]].&lt;ref name=FCR17 /&gt;

== Floristic Quality Index ==
The '''Floristic Quality Index''' (FQI) is calculated by multiplying the mean C value by the square root of the total number of species:

&lt;math&gt; \bar{C}\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;

'''FlowJo''' is a software package for analyzing [[flow cytometry]] data. Files produced by modern flow cytometers are written in the [http://www.isac-net.org/content/view/101/150/ Flow Cytometry Standard] format with an .fcs file extension. FlowJo will import and analyze cytometry data regardless of which FACS ('''F'''luorescence '''A'''ctivated '''C'''ell '''S'''orting) machine is used to collect the data.

==Operation==
In FlowJo, samples are organized in a "Workspace" window, which presents a hierarchical view of all the samples and their analyses (gates and statistics). Viewing an entire experiment in a Workspace permits organizing and managing complex cytometry experiments and produces detailed graphical reports. FlowJo's ability to automate repetitive operations facilitates the production of statistics tables and graphical reports when the experiment involves many samples, parameters and/or operations.

Within a workspace, samples can be grouped or sorted by various attributes such as the panel of antibodies with which they are stained, tissue type, or patient from whom they came. When an operation on a group is initiated, FlowJo can perform the same operation on every sample belonging to that group. Thus, you can apply a [[gate (cytometry)|gate]] to a sample, copy it to the group, and that gate will be automatically placed on all samples in the group.

FlowJo provides tools for the creation of:
* [[Histogram]] and other plot overlays
* [[Cell cycle]] analysis
* [[Calcium in biology|Calcium]] flux analysis
* [[Cell growth|Proliferation]] analysis
* Quantification
* Cluster identification and backgating display

==Development==
FlowJo became a commercial product in 1996. In 2002, Tree Star released a [[Windows]] version. FlowJo is currently developed by FlowJo LLC, a privately owned life sciences software company based in Ashland, Oregon. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150629006156/en/FlowJo-BD-Partner-Streamline-Flow-Cytometry-Data&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60541">{{short description|Hypothesis that living organisms interact with their surroundings in a self-regulating system}}
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|The study of planetary habitability is partly based upon extrapolation from knowledge of the [[Earth]]'s conditions, as the Earth is the only planet currently known to harbour life.]]

The '''Gaia hypothesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aɪ|.|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|eɪ|.|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aɪ|ˈ|ʌ}}), also known as the '''Gaia theory''' or the '''Gaia principle''', proposes that living [[organism]]s interact with their [[inorganic]] surroundings on [[Earth]] to form a [[synergistic]] and [[Homeostasis|self-regulating]], [[complex system]] that helps to maintain and perpetuate the conditions for [[life]] on the planet.

The hypothesis was formulated by the chemist [[James Lovelock]]&lt;ref name="J1972" /&gt; and co-developed by the microbiologist [[Lynn Margulis]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="lovelock1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lovelock|first1=J.E.|last2=Margulis|first2=L.|title=Atmospheric homeostasis by and for the biosphere: the Gaia hypothesis|journal=Tellus|date=1974|volume=26|series=Series A|issue=1–2|pages=2–10|doi=10.1111/j.2153-3490.1974.tb01946.x|url=http://tellusa.net/index.php/tellusa/article/view/9731|accessdate=20 October 2012|publisher=International Meteorological Institute|location=Stockholm|issn=1600-0870|ref=harv|bibcode=1974Tell...26....2L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock named the idea after [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the primordial goddess who personified the Earth in [[Greek mythology]]. In 2006, the [[Geological Society of London]] awarded Lovelock the [[Wollaston Medal]] in part for his work on the Gaia hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wollaston Award Lovelock|url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/About/History/Awards-Citations-Replies-2001-Onwards/2006-Awards-Citations-Replies|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics related to the hypothesis include how the [[biosphere]] and the [[evolution]] of organisms affect the stability of [[global temperature]], [[salinity]] of [[seawater]], [[atmospheric oxygen]] levels, the maintenance of a [[hydrosphere]] of liquid water and other environmental variables that affect the [[habitability of Earth]].

The Gaia hypothesis was initially criticized for being [[teleological]] and against the principles of [[natural selection]], but later refinements aligned the Gaia hypothesis with ideas from fields such as [[Earth system science]], [[biogeochemistry]] and [[systems ecology]].&lt;ref name="Turney, Jon 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartzman2002"&gt;{{cite book |author=Schwartzman, David |title=Life, Temperature, and the Earth: The Self-Organizing Biosphere |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2002 |isbn=0-231-10213-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gribbin, John (1990), "Hothouse earth: The greenhouse effect and Gaia" (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson)&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock also once described the "geophysiology" of the Earth.&lt;ref name="agesofgaia"&gt;Lovelock, James, (1995) "The Ages of Gaia: A Biography of Our Living Earth" (W.W.Norton &amp; Co)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=December 2017}} Even so, the Gaia hypothesis continues to attract criticism, and today some scientists consider it to be only weakly supported by, or at odds with, the available evidence.&lt;ref name="kirchner2002"&gt;{{Citation |last= Kirchner |first = James W. |title =Toward a future for Gaia theory |journal=[[Climatic Change (journal)|Climatic Change]] |volume = 52 |pages = 391–408 |date = 2002 | doi = 10.1023/a:1014237331082 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="volk2002"&gt;{{Citation |last= Volk |first = Tyler |title =The Gaia hypothesis: fact, theory, and wishful thinking |journal = Climatic Change |volume = 52 |pages = 423–430 |date = 2002 | doi = 10.1023/a:1014218227825 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="beerling2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beerling |first=David |authorlink=David Beerling|date=2007 |title=The Emerald Planet: How plants changed Earth's history |url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780192806024.do |location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press |page= |isbn= 978-0-19-280602-4 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Gaian hypotheses suggest that organisms [[Co-evolution|co-evolve]] with their environment: that is, they "influence their [[abiotic]] environment, and that environment in turn influences the [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] by [[Darwinism|Darwinian process]]". Lovelock (1995) gave evidence of this in his second book, showing the evolution from the world of the early [[Bacteria|thermo-acido-philic]] and [[methanogenic bacteria]] towards the oxygen-enriched [[atmosphere]] today that supports more [[Phanerozoic|complex life]].

A reduced version of the hypothesis has been called "influential Gaia"&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapenis|first=Andrei G.|year=2002|title=Directed Evolution of the Biosphere: Biogeochemical Selection or Gaia?|url=|journal=The Professional Geographer|volume=54 |issue=3|pages=379–391|via=[Peer Reviewed Journal]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in "Directed Evolution of the Biosphere: Biogeochemical Selection or Gaia?" by Andrei G. Lapenis, which states the [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] influence certain aspects of the abiotic world, e.g. [[temperature]] and atmosphere.  This is not the work of an individual but a collective of Russian scientific research that was combined into this peer reviewed publication. It states the coevolution of life and the environment through “micro-forces”&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; and biogeochemical processes. An example is how the activity of [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] bacteria during Precambrian times have completely modified the [[Earth's atmosphere|Earth atmosphere]] to turn it aerobic, and as such supporting evolution of life (in particular [[eukaryotic]] life).

Since barriers existed throughout the Twentieth Century between Russia and the rest of the world, it is only relatively recently that the early Russian scientists who introduced concepts overlapping the Gaia hypothesis have become better known to the Western scientific community.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; These scientists include:
# [[Piotr Kropotkin|Piotr Alekseevich Kropotkin]] (1842–1921)
# Rafail Vasil’evich Rizpolozhensky (1847–1918)
# [[Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky]] (1863–1945)
# Vladimir Alexandrovich Kostitzin (1886–1963)

Biologists and Earth scientists usually view the factors that stabilize the characteristics of a period as an undirected [[emergent property]] or [[entelechy]] of the system; as each individual species pursues its own self-interest, for example, their combined actions may have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Opponents of this view sometimes reference examples of events that resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth's atmosphere from a [[reducing environment]] to an [[oxygen]]-rich one at the end of the [[Archean|Archaean]] and the beginning of the [[Proterozoic]] periods.

Less accepted versions of the hypothesis claim that changes in the biosphere are brought about through the [[Superorganism|coordination of living organisms]] and maintain those conditions through [[homeostasis]]. In some versions of [[Gaia philosophy]], all lifeforms are considered part of one single living planetary being called ''Gaia''. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas and the terrestrial crust would be results of interventions carried out by Gaia through the [[Coevolution|coevolving]] diversity of living organisms.

The Gaia hypothesis was an influence on the [[deep ecology]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;David Landis Barnhill, Roger S. Gottlieb (eds.), ''Deep Ecology and World Religions: New Essays on Sacred Ground'', SUNY Press, 2010, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The Gaia hypothesis posits that the Earth is a self-regulating [[complex system]] involving the [[biosphere]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]]s and the [[pedosphere]], tightly coupled as an evolving system. The hypothesis contends that this system as a whole, called Gaia, seeks a physical and chemical environment optimal for contemporary life.&lt;ref name="vanishing255"&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, p. 255. {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaia evolves through a [[Cybernetic#In biology|cybernetic]] [[feedback]] system operated unconsciously by the [[biota (ecology)|biota]], leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability in a full homeostasis. Many processes in the Earth's surface essential for the conditions of life depend on the interaction of living forms, especially [[microorganisms]], with inorganic elements. These processes establish a global control system that regulates Earth's [[Sea surface temperature|surface temperature]], [[atmosphere composition]] and [[ocean]] [[salinity]], powered by the global thermodynamic disequilibrium state of the Earth system.&lt;ref&gt;Kleidon, Axel. ''How does the earth system generate and maintain thermodynamic disequilibrium and what does it imply for the future of the planet?''. Article submitted to the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'' on Thu, 10 Mar 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Article submitted to Royal Society is not a valid reference. This must be replaced by actual article citation if accepted, or an alternative reference --&gt;

The existence of a planetary homeostasis influenced by living forms had been observed previously in the field of [[biogeochemistry]], and it is being investigated also in other fields like [[Earth system science]]. The originality of the Gaia hypothesis relies on the assessment that such homeostatic balance is actively pursued with the goal of keeping the optimal conditions for life, even when terrestrial or external events menace them.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, p. 179. {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of global surface temperature===
[[File:All palaeotemps.png|thumb|Rob Rohde's palaeotemperature graphs]]
{{See also|Paleoclimatology}}
Since life started on Earth, the energy provided by the [[Sun]] has increased by 25% to 30%;&lt;ref name="Owen1979"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Owen, T. | author2 = Cess, R.D. | author3 = Ramanathan, V. | date = 1979 | title = Earth: An enhanced carbon dioxide greenhouse to compensate for reduced solar luminosity | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 277 | pages = 640–2 | doi = 10.1038/277640a0 | issue=5698 | bibcode = 1979Natur.277..640O | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the surface temperature of the planet has remained within the levels of habitability, reaching quite regular low and high margins.  Lovelock has also hypothesised that methanogens produced elevated levels of methane in the early atmosphere, giving a view similar to that found in petrochemical smog, similar in some respects to the atmosphere on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].&lt;ref name="agesofgaia"/&gt; This, he suggests tended to screen out ultraviolet until the formation of the ozone screen, maintaining a degree of homeostasis.  However, the [[Snowball Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, P.F. 2001. [http://www.snowballearth.org ''Snowball Earth theory'']&lt;/ref&gt; research has suggested that "oxygen shocks" and reduced methane levels led, during the [[Huronian]], [[Sturtian]] and [[Marinoan]]/[[Cryogenian|Varanger]] Ice Ages, to a world that very nearly became a solid "snowball". These epochs are evidence against the ability of the pre [[Phanerozoic]] biosphere to fully self-regulate.

Processing of the greenhouse gas CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, explained below, plays a critical role in the maintenance of the Earth temperature within the limits of habitability.

The [[CLAW hypothesis]], inspired by the Gaia hypothesis, proposes a [[feedback|feedback loop]] that operates between [[ocean]] [[ecosystem]]s and the [[Earth]]'s [[climate]].&lt;ref name="CLAW87"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/326655a0 |author=[[Robert Jay Charlson|Charlson, R. J.]], [[James Lovelock|Lovelock, J. E]], Andreae, M. O. and Warren, S. G. |title=Oceanic phytoplankton, atmospheric sulphur, cloud albedo and climate |journal=Nature |volume=326 |issue=6114 |pages=655–661 |date=1987 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v326/n6114/abs/326655a0.html |bibcode=1987Natur.326..655C |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[hypothesis]] specifically proposes that particular [[phytoplankton]] that produce [[dimethyl sulfide]] are responsive to variations in [[climate forcing]], and that these responses lead to a [[negative feedback|negative feedback loop]] that acts to stabilise the [[temperature]] of the [[Earth's atmosphere]].

Currently the increase in human population and the environmental impact of their activities, such as the multiplication of [[greenhouse gases]] may cause [[negative feedback]]s in the environment to become [[positive feedback]]. Lovelock has stated that this could bring an [[James Lovelock#The revenge of Gaia|extremely accelerated global warming]],&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he has since stated the effects will likely occur more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock J., NBC News.

====Daisyworld simulations====
[[File:StandardDaisyWorldRun2color.gif|thumb|Plots from a standard black &amp; white [[Daisyworld]] simulation]]
{{Main|Daisyworld}}
James Lovelock and [[Andrew Watson (scientist)|Andrew Watson]] developed the mathematical model [[Daisyworld]], in which temperature regulation arises from a simple ecosystem consisting of two species whose activity varies in response to the planet's environment. The model demonstrates that beneficial feedback mechanisms can emerge in this "toy world" containing only self-interested organisms rather than through classic [[group selection]] mechanisms.&lt;ref name="daisyworld"&gt;{{cite journal
|date = 1983

|volume = 35B
|pages = 286–9
|bibcode = 1983TellB..35..284W

|last1 = Watson | first1= A.J. | last2= Lovelock | first2= J.E
|issue = 4
|ref = harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daisyworld examines the [[Earth's energy budget|energy budget]] of a planet populated by two different types of plants, black daisies and white daisies. The colour of the daisies influences the [[albedo]] of the planet such that black daisies absorb light and warm the planet, while white daisies reflect light and cool the planet. As the model runs the output of the "sun" increases, meaning that the surface temperature of an uninhabited "gray" planet will steadily rise. In contrast, on Daisyworld competition between the daisies (based on temperature-effects on growth rates) leads to a shifting balance of daisy populations that tends to favour a planetary temperature close to the optimum for daisy growth.

It has been suggested that the results were predictable because Lovelock and Watson selected examples that produced the responses they desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1023494111532 | date = 2003 | last1 = Kirchner | first1 = James W. | journal = Climatic Change | volume = 58 |issue=1–2| pages = 21–45 |title=The Gaia Hypothesis: Conjectures and Refutations | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of oceanic salinity===
Ocean [[salinity]] has been constant at about 3.5% for a very long time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Introduction to Ocean Sciences|last=Segar|first=Douglas|publisher=Library of Congress|year=2012|isbn=978-0-9857859-0-1|location=http://www.reefimages.com/oceans/SegarOcean3Chap05.pdf|pages=Chapter 5 3rd Edition|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salinity stability in oceanic environments is important as most cells require a rather constant salinity and do not generally tolerate values above 5%. The constant ocean salinity was a long-standing mystery, because no process counterbalancing the salt influx from rivers was known. Recently it was suggested&lt;ref name="Gorham19912"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gorham|first=Eville|date=1 January 1991|title=Biogeochemistry: its origins and development|url=https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00002942|journal=Biogeochemistry|publisher=Kluwer Academic|volume=13|issue=3|pages=199–239|doi=10.1007/BF00002942|issn=1573-515X|ref=harv|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that salinity may also be strongly influenced by [[seawater]] circulation through hot [[basalt]]ic rocks, and emerging as hot water vents on [[mid-ocean ridge]]s. However, the composition of seawater is far from equilibrium, and it is difficult to explain this fact without the influence of organic processes. One suggested explanation lies in the formation of salt plains throughout Earth's history. It is hypothesized that these are created by bacterial colonies that fix ions and heavy metals during their life processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the biogeochemical processes of the earth, sources and sinks are the movement of elements. The composition of salt ions within our oceans and seas are: sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), chlorine (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), sulfate (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), Magnesium (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).  The elements that comprise salinity do not readily change and are a conservative property of seawater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  There are many mechanisms that change salinity from a particulate form to a dissolved form and back. The known sources of sodium i.e. salts is when weathering, erosion, and dissolution of rocks transport into rivers and deposit into the oceans.

The Gaia hypothesis states that the Earth's [[Atmospheric chemistry#Atmospheric composition|atmospheric composition]] is kept at a dynamically steady state by the presence of life.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, p. 163. {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atmospheric composition provides the conditions that contemporary life has adapted to. All the atmospheric gases other than [[noble gas]]es present in the atmosphere are either made by organisms or processed by them.

The stability of the atmosphere in Earth is not a consequence of [[chemical equilibrium]]. [[Oxygen]] is a reactive compound, and should eventually combine with gases and minerals of the Earth's atmosphere and crust.  Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities about 50 million years before the start of the [[Great Oxygenation Event]].&lt;ref name=Anabar2007&gt;{{Cite journal| last4 = Arnold| last6 = Creaser| last3 = Lyons| first1 = A. | first2 = Y.| last9 = Scott| last2 = Duan | first3 = T. | first4 = G.| last8 = Gordon | first5 = B. | first10 = J. | first6 = R.| last10 = Garvin | first7 = A.| last11 = Buick | first8 = G. | first11 = R. | first9 = C.| title = A whiff of oxygen before the great oxidation event?| journal = Science| volume = 317| issue = 5846| year = 2007| last7 = Kaufman| pages = 1903–1906| last5 = Kendall| pmid = 17901330| last1 = Anbar | doi = 10.1126/science.1140325|bibcode = 2007Sci...317.1903A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the start of the [[Cambrian]] period, atmospheric oxygen concentrations have fluctuated between 15% and 35% of atmospheric volume.&lt;ref name=Berner1999&gt;{{Cite journal

===Processing of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
{{See also|Carbon cycle}}
Gaia scientists see the participation of living organisms in the [[carbon cycle]] as one of the complex processes that maintain conditions suitable for life. The only significant natural source of [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric carbon dioxide]] ([[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) is [[volcanic activity]], while the only significant removal is through the precipitation of [[carbonate rocks]].&lt;ref name="Karhu1996"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Karhu, J.A. | author2 = Holland, H.D. | date = 1 October 1996 | title = Carbon isotopes and the rise of atmospheric oxygen | journal = [[Geology (journal)|Geology]] | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 867–870 | url = http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/10/867 | doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;0867:CIATRO&gt;2.3.CO;2|bibcode = 1996Geo....24..867K | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon precipitation, solution and [[Carbon fixation|fixation]] are influenced by the [[bacteria]] and plant roots in soils, where they improve gaseous circulation, or in coral reefs, where calcium carbonate is deposited as a solid on the sea floor. Calcium carbonate is used by living organisms to manufacture carbonaceous tests and shells. Once dead, the living organisms' shells fall to the bottom of the oceans where they generate deposits of chalk and limestone.

One of these organisms is ''[[Emiliania huxleyi]]'', an abundant [[coccolithophore]] [[algae]] which also has a role in the formation of [[cloud]]s.&lt;ref name="Harding2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Harding, Stephan |title=Animate Earth |publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing |date=2006 |pages=65 |isbn=1-933392-29-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; excess is compensated by an increase of coccolithophoride life, increasing the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; locked in the ocean floor. Coccolithophorides increase the cloud cover, hence control the surface temperature, help cool the whole planet and favor precipitations necessary for terrestrial plants.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Lately the atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration has increased and there is some evidence that concentrations of ocean [[algal bloom]]s are also increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | date = 12 September 2007 | title = Interagency Report Says Harmful Algal Blooms Increasing | url = http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2007/sep07/noaa07-r435.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080209234239/http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2007/sep07/noaa07-r435.html | archivedate = 9 February 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lichen]] and other organisms accelerate the [[weathering]] of rocks in the surface, while the decomposition of rocks also happens faster in the soil, thanks to the activity of roots, fungi, bacteria and subterranean animals. The flow of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the soil is therefore regulated with the help of living beings. When CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels rise in the atmosphere the temperature increases and plants grow. This growth brings higher consumption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the plants, who process it into the soil, removing it from the atmosphere.

==History==

===Precedents===
[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|''[[Earthrise]]'' taken from [[Apollo 8]] on December 24, 1968]]
The idea of the Earth as an integrated whole, a living being, has a long tradition. The [[Gaia (mythology)|mythical Gaia]] was the primal Greek goddess personifying the [[Earth]], the Greek version of "[[Mother Nature]]" (from Ge = Earth, and Aia = 
[[PIE]] grandmother), or the [[Earth Mother]]. James Lovelock gave this name to his hypothesis after a suggestion from the novelist [[William Golding]], who was living in the same village as Lovelock at the time ([[Bowerchalke]], [[Wiltshire]], UK). Golding's advice was based on Gea, an alternative spelling for the name of the Greek goddess, which is used as prefix in geology, geophysics and geochemistry.&lt;ref name=vanish09 /&gt; Golding later made reference to Gaia in his [[Nobel prize]] acceptance speech.

In the eighteenth century, as [[geology]] consolidated as a modern science, [[James Hutton]] maintained that geological and biological processes are interlinked.&lt;ref name=CapraWeb&gt;{{cite book |author=Capra, Fritjof |title=The web of life: a new scientific understanding of living systems |publisher=Anchor Books |location=Garden City, N.Y |date=1996 |page=23|isbn=0-385-47675-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[naturalist]] and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] recognized the coevolution of living organisms, climate, and Earth's crust.&lt;ref name=CapraWeb /&gt; In the twentieth century, [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] formulated a theory of Earth's development that is now one of the foundations of ecology. Vernadsky was a Ukrainian [[geochemist]] and was one of the first scientists to recognize that the oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere result from biological processes. During the 1920s he published works arguing that living organisms could reshape the planet as surely as any physical force. Vernadsky was a pioneer of the scientific bases for the environmental sciences.&lt;ref&gt;S.R. Weart, 2003, ''The Discovery of Global Warming'', Cambridge, Harvard Press&lt;/ref&gt; His visionary pronouncements were not widely accepted in the West, and some decades later the Gaia hypothesis received the same type of initial resistance from the scientific community.

Also in the turn to the 20th century [[Aldo Leopold]], pioneer in the development of modern [[environmental ethics]] and in the movement for [[wilderness]] conservation, suggested a living Earth in his biocentric or holistic ethics regarding land.

{{quotation|It is at least not impossible to regard the earth's parts—soil, mountains, rivers, atmosphere etc,—as organs or parts of organs of a coordinated whole, each part with its definite function. And if we could see this whole, as a whole, through a great period of time, we might perceive not only organs with coordinated functions, but possibly also that process of consumption as replacement which in biology we call metabolism, or growth. In such case we would have all the visible attributes of a living thing, which we do not realize to be such because it is too big, and its life processes too slow.| Aldo Leopold | ''Animate Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Stephan. ''Animate Earth Science, Intuition and Gaia''. Chelsea Green Publishing, 2006, p. 44. {{ISBN|1-933392-29-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another influence for the Gaia hypothesis and the [[environmental movement]] in general came as a side effect of the [[Space Race]] between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. During the 1960s, the first humans in space could see how the Earth looked as a whole. The photograph ''[[Earthrise]]'' taken by astronaut [[William Anders]] in 1968 during the [[Apollo 8]] mission became, through the [[Overview Effect]] an early symbol for the global ecology movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0309/lm11.html 100 Photographs that Changed the World by Life - The Digital Journalist]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation of the hypothesis===
[[File:James Lovelock in 2005.jpg|thumb|[[James Lovelock]], 2005]]
Lovelock started defining the idea of a self-regulating Earth controlled by the community of living organisms in September 1965, while working at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in California on methods of detecting [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]].&lt;ref name="Lovelock1965"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lovelock, J.E. | date = 1965 | title = A physical basis for life detection experiments | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 207 | issue = 7 | pages = 568–570 | doi = 10.1038/207568a0 | pmid=5883628|bibcode = 1965Natur.207..568L | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jameslovelock.org/page4.html Geophysiology]&lt;/ref&gt;  The first paper to mention it was ''Planetary Atmospheres: Compositional and other Changes Associated with the Presence of Life'', co-authored with C.E. Giffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Lovelock, J.E. | author2 = Giffin, C.E. | date = 1969 | title = Planetary Atmospheres: Compositional and other changes associated with the presence of Life | journal = Advances in the Astronautical Sciences | volume = 25 | pages = 179–193 | isbn = 0-87703-028-6 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main concept was that life could be detected in a planetary scale by the chemical composition of the atmosphere. According to the data gathered by the [[Pic du Midi de Bigorre|Pic du Midi observatory]], planets like Mars or Venus had atmospheres in [[chemical equilibrium]]. This difference with the Earth atmosphere was considered to be a proof that there was no life in these planets.

Lovelock formulated the ''Gaia Hypothesis'' in journal articles in 1972&lt;ref name="J1972"&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. E. Lovelock | title = Gaia as seen through the atmosphere | date = 1972 | journal = [[Atmospheric Environment]] | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = 579–580 | doi = 10.1016/0004-6981(72)90076-5 | ref = harv|bibcode = 1972AtmEn...6..579L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1974,&lt;ref name="lovelock1974" /&gt; followed by a popularizing 1979 book ''Gaia: A new look at life on Earth''. An article in the ''[[New Scientist]]'' of February 6, 1975,&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, John and Sidney Epton, (February 8, 1975). "The quest for Gaia". [https://books.google.com/books?id=pnV6UYEkU4YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false New Scientist], p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; and a popular book length version of the hypothesis, published in 1979 as ''The Quest for Gaia'', began to attract scientific and critical attention.

Lovelock called it first the Earth feedback hypothesis,&lt;ref name="Lovelock01"&gt;{{harvnb|Lovelock, James|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was a way to explain the fact that combinations of chemicals including [[oxygen]] and [[methane]] persist in stable concentrations in the atmosphere of the Earth. Lovelock suggested detecting such combinations in other planets' atmospheres as a relatively reliable and cheap way to detect life.

[[File:Lynn Margulis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lynn Margulis]]]]

Later, other relationships such as sea creatures producing sulfur and iodine in approximately the same quantities as required by land creatures emerged and helped bolster the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=W.D. | last1=Hamilton | first2=T.M. | last2=Lenton | title=Spora and Gaia: how microbes fly with their clouds | journal=Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume=10 | pages=1–16 | date=1998 | issue=1 | url=http://ejour-fup.unifi.it/index.php/eee/article/viewFile/787/733 | format=PDF | doi=10.1080/08927014.1998.9522867 | ref=harv | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723055017/http://ejour-fup.unifi.it/index.php/eee/article/viewFile/787/733 | archivedate=2011-07-23 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 [[microbiologist]] Dr. [[Lynn Margulis]] joined Lovelock in the effort of fleshing out the initial hypothesis into scientifically proven concepts, contributing her knowledge about how microbes affect the atmosphere and the different layers in the surface of the planet.&lt;ref name="Turney, Jon 2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Turney, Jon |title=Lovelock and Gaia: Signs of Life |publisher=Icon Books |location=UK |date=2003 |isbn=1-84046-458-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American biologist had also awakened criticism from the scientific community with her theory on the origin of [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[organelle]]s and her contributions to the [[endosymbiotic theory]], nowadays accepted. Margulis dedicated the last of eight chapters in her book, ''The Symbiotic Planet'', to Gaia. However, she objected to the widespread personification of Gaia and stressed that Gaia is "not an organism", but "an emergent property of interaction among organisms". She defined Gaia as "the series of interacting ecosystems that compose a single huge ecosystem at the Earth's surface. Period". The book's most memorable "slogan" was actually quipped by a student of Margulis': "Gaia is just symbiosis as seen from space".

James Lovelock called his first proposal the ''Gaia hypothesis'' but has also used the term ''Gaia theory''. Lovelock states that the initial formulation was based on observation, but still lacked a scientific explanation. The Gaia hypothesis has since been supported by a number of scientific experiments&lt;ref name="J1990"&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. E. Lovelock | title = Hands up for the Gaia hypothesis | date = 1990 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 344 | issue = 6262 | pages = 100–2 | doi = 10.1038/344100a0|bibcode = 1990Natur.344..100L | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided a number of useful predictions.&lt;ref name="Volk2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Volk, Tyler |title=Gaia's Body: Toward a Physiology of Earth |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |date=2003 |isbn=0-262-72042-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, wider research proved the original hypothesis wrong, in the sense that it is not life alone but the whole Earth system that does the regulating.&lt;ref name="vanishing255"/&gt;

===First Gaia conference===
In 1985, the first public symposium on the Gaia hypothesis, ''Is The Earth A Living Organism?'' was held at [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], August 1–6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joseph |first=Lawrence E. |title=Britain's Whole Earth Guru |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=November 23, 1986 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/23/magazine/britain-s-whole-earth-guru.html |accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal sponsor was the [[National Audubon Society]]. Speakers included James Lovelock, [[George Wald]], [[Mary Catherine Bateson]], [[Lewis Thomas]], [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]], Donald Michael, [[Christopher Bird]], [[Thomas Berry]], [[David Abram]], [[Michael A. Cohen|Michael Cohen]], and William Fields. Some 500 people attended.&lt;ref&gt;Bunyard, Peter (1996), "Gaia in Action: Science of the Living Earth" (Floris Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Gaia conference===
In 1988, [[climatology|climatologist]] [[Stephen Schneider]] organised a conference of the [[American Geophysical Union]]. The first Chapman Conference on Gaia,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; was held in San Diego, California on March 7, 1988.

During the "philosophical foundations" session of the conference, [[David Abram]] spoke on the influence of metaphor in science, and of the Gaia hypothesis as offering a new and potentially game-changing metaphorics, while [[James Kirchner]] criticised the Gaia hypothesis for its imprecision. Kirchner claimed that Lovelock and Margulis had not presented one Gaia hypothesis, but four -

* [[Coevolution|CoEvolutionary]] Gaia: that life and the environment had evolved in a coupled way. Kirchner claimed that this was already accepted scientifically and was not new.
* [[Homeostatic]] Gaia: that life maintained the stability of the natural environment, and that this stability enabled life to continue to exist.
* [[Geophysics|Geophysical]] Gaia: that the Gaia hypothesis generated interest in geophysical cycles and therefore led to interesting new research in terrestrial geophysical dynamics.
* Optimising Gaia: that Gaia shaped the planet in a way that made it an optimal environment for life as a whole. Kirchner claimed that this was not testable and therefore was not scientific.

Of Homeostatic Gaia, Kirchner recognised two alternatives. "Weak Gaia" asserted that life tends to make the environment stable for the flourishing of all life. "Strong Gaia" according to Kirchner, asserted that life tends to make the environment stable, ''to enable'' the flourishing of all life. Strong Gaia, Kirchner claimed, was untestable and therefore not scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode=1989RvGeo..27..223K | doi = 10.1029/RG027i002p00223 | title=The Gaia hypothesis: Can it be tested? | date=1989 | last1=Kirchner | first1=James W. | journal=Reviews of Geophysics | volume=27 | issue=2 | pages=223 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovelock and other Gaia-supporting scientists, however, did attempt to disprove the claim that the hypothesis is not scientific because it is impossible to test it by controlled experiment. For example, against the charge that Gaia was teleological, Lovelock and Andrew Watson offered the [[Daisyworld]] Model (and its modifications, above) as evidence against most of these criticisms.&lt;ref name="daisyworld"/&gt;  Lovelock said that the Daisyworld model "demonstrates that self-regulation of the global environment can emerge from competition amongst types of life altering their local environment in different ways".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=10968941 | date=2000 | last1=Lenton | first1=TM | last2=Lovelock | first2=JE | title=Daisyworld is Darwinian: Constraints on adaptation are important for planetary self-regulation | volume=206 | issue=1 | pages=109–14 | doi=10.1006/jtbi.2000.2105 | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovelock was careful to present a version of the Gaia hypothesis that had no claim that Gaia intentionally or consciously maintained the complex balance in her environment that life needed to survive. It would appear that the claim that Gaia acts "intentionally" was a metaphoric statement in his popular initial book and was not meant to be taken literally. This new statement of the Gaia hypothesis was more acceptable to the scientific community. Most accusations of [[teleology|teleologism]] ceased, following this conference.

===Third Gaia conference===
By the time of the 2nd Chapman Conference on the Gaia Hypothesis, held at Valencia, Spain, on 23 June 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simón|first=Federico|title=GEOLOGÍA Enfoque multidisciplinar La hipótesis Gaia madura en Valencia con los últimos avances científicos|journal=El País|date=21 June 2000|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2000/06/21/futuro/961538404_850215.html|accessdate=1 December 2013|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; the situation had changed significantly. Rather than a discussion of the Gaian teleological views, or "types" of Gaia hypotheses, the focus was upon the specific mechanisms by which basic short term homeostasis was maintained within a framework of significant evolutionary long term structural change.

The major questions were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Information Chapman Conference on the Gaia Hypothesis University of Valencia Valencia, Spain June 19-23, 2000 (Monday through Friday) |url=http://www.agu.org/meetings/chapman/chapman_archive/cc00bcall.html |work=AGU Meetings |accessdate=7 January 2017 |author=American Geophysical Union }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# "How has the global biogeochemical/climate system called Gaia changed in time? What is its history? Can Gaia maintain stability of the system at one time scale but still undergo vectorial change at longer time scales? How can the geologic record be used to examine these questions?"
# "What is the structure of Gaia? Are the feedbacks sufficiently strong to influence the evolution of climate? Are there parts of the system determined pragmatically by whatever disciplinary study is being undertaken at any given time or are there a set of parts that should be taken as most true for understanding Gaia as containing evolving organisms over time? What are the feedbacks among these different parts of the Gaian system, and what does the near closure of matter mean for the structure of Gaia as a global ecosystem and for the productivity of life?"
# "How do models of Gaian processes and phenomena relate to reality and how do they help address and understand Gaia? How do results from Daisyworld transfer to the real world? What are the main candidates for "daisies"? Does it matter for Gaia theory whether we find daisies or not? How should we be searching for daisies, and should we intensify the search? How can Gaian mechanisms be investigated using process models or global models of the climate system that include the biota and allow for chemical cycling?"

In 1997, Tyler Volk argued that a Gaian system is almost inevitably produced as a result of an evolution towards far-from-equilibrium homeostatic states that maximise [[entropy]] production, and Kleidon (2004) agreed stating: "...homeostatic behavior can emerge from a state of MEP associated with the planetary albedo"; "...the resulting behavior of a biotic Earth at a state of MEP may well lead to near-homeostatic behavior of the Earth system on long time scales, as stated by the Gaia hypothesis". Staley (2002) has similarly proposed "...an alternative form of Gaia theory based on more traditional Darwinian principles... In [this] new approach, environmental regulation is a consequence of population dynamics, not Darwinian selection. The role of selection is to favor organisms that are best adapted to prevailing environmental conditions. However, the environment is not a static backdrop for evolution, but is heavily influenced by the presence of living organisms. The resulting co-evolving dynamical process eventually leads to the convergence of equilibrium and optimal conditions".

===Fourth Gaia conference===
A fourth international conference on the Gaia hypothesis, sponsored by the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority and others, was held in October 2006 at the Arlington, VA campus of George Mason University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaia Theory Conference at George Mason University Law School|url=http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/Communications/PressReleases/page7530.aspx|accessdate=1 December 2013|author=Official Site of Arlington County Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Ogle, Chief Naturalist, for NVRPA, and long-time Gaia hypothesis proponent, organized the event.  Lynn Margulis, Distinguished University Professor in the Department of Geosciences, University of Massachusetts-Amherst, and long-time advocate of the Gaia hypothesis, was a keynote speaker. Among many other speakers: Tyler Volk, Co-director of the Program in Earth and Environmental Science at New York University; Dr. Donald Aitken, Principal of Donald Aitken Associates; Dr. Thomas Lovejoy, President of the Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment; Robert Correll, Senior Fellow, Atmospheric Policy Program, American Meteorological Society and noted environmental ethicist, J. Baird Callicott.

This conference approached the Gaia hypothesis as both science and metaphor as a means of understanding how we might begin addressing 21st century issues such as climate change and ongoing environmental destruction.

==Criticism==
After initially being largely ignored by most scientists (from 1969 until 1977), thereafter for a period the initial Gaia hypothesis was criticized by a number of scientists, such as [[Ford Doolittle]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doolittle|first=W. F.|year=1981|title=Is Nature Really Motherly|url=|journal=The Coevolution Quarterly|volume=Spring|pages=58–63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Extended Phenotype: the Long Reach of the Gene|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0-19-286088-7|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Jay Gould]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Turney, Jon. "Lovelock and Gaia: Signs of Life" (Revolutions in Science)&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock has said that because his hypothesis is named after a Greek goddess, and championed by many non-scientists,&lt;ref name="Lovelock01"/&gt; the Gaia hypothesis was interpreted as a [[neo-Pagan]] [[religion]]. Many scientists in particular also criticised the approach taken in his popular book ''Gaia, a New Look at Life on Earth'' for being [[teleology|teleological]]—a belief that things are purposeful and aimed towards a goal. Responding to this critique in 1990, Lovelock stated, "Nowhere in our writings do we express the idea that planetary self-regulation is purposeful, or involves foresight or planning by the [[biota (ecology)|biota]]".

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] criticised Gaia as being "a metaphor, not a mechanism."&lt;ref name="Gould 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gould S.J. |title=Kropotkin was no crackpot |journal=Natural History |volume=106 |pages=12–21 |date=June 1997  |url=http://libcom.org/library/kropotkin-was-no-crackpot |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to know the actual mechanisms by which self-regulating homeostasis was achieved. In his defense of Gaia, David Abram argues that Gould overlooked the fact that "mechanism", itself, is a metaphor — albeit an exceedingly common and often unrecognized metaphor — one which leads us to consider natural and living systems as though they were machines organized and built from outside (rather than as [[autopoiesis|autopoietic]] or self-organizing phenomena). Mechanical metaphors, according to Abram, lead us to overlook the active or agential quality of living entities, while the organismic metaphorics of the Gaia hypothesis accentuate the active agency of both the biota and the biosphere as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Abram, D. (1988) "The Mechanical and the Organic: On the Impact of Metaphor in Science" in Scientists on Gaia, edited by Stephen Schneider and Penelope Boston, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildethics.org/essays/the_mechanical_and_the_organic.html |title=The Mechanical and the Organic |accessdate=August 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223165936/http://www.wildethics.org/essays/the_mechanical_and_the_organic.html |archivedate=February 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to causality in Gaia, Lovelock argues that no single mechanism is responsible, that the connections between the various known mechanisms may never be known, that this is accepted in other fields of biology and ecology as a matter of course, and that specific hostility is reserved for his own hypothesis for other reasons.&lt;ref name="Lovelock, James 2001"&gt;Lovelock, James (2001), ''Homage to Gaia: The Life of an Independent Scientist'' (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from clarifying his language and understanding of what is meant by a life form, Lovelock himself ascribes most of the criticism to a lack of understanding of non-linear mathematics by his critics, and a linearizing form of [[greedy reductionism]] in which all events have to be immediately ascribed to specific causes before the fact. He also states that most of his critics are biologists but that his hypothesis includes experiments in fields outside biology, and that some self-regulating phenomena may not be mathematically explainable.&lt;ref name="Lovelock, James 2001"/&gt;

===Natural selection and evolution===
Lovelock has suggested that global biological feedback mechanisms could evolve by [[natural selection]], stating that organisms that improve their environment for their survival do better than those that damage their environment. However, in the early 1980s, [[Ford Doolittle|W. Ford Doolittle]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] separately argued against Gaia. Doolittle argued that nothing in the [[genome]] of individual organisms could provide the feedback mechanisms proposed by Lovelock, and therefore the Gaia hypothesis proposed no plausible mechanism and was unscientific.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dawkins meanwhile stated that for organisms to act in concert would require foresight and planning, which is contrary to the current scientific understanding of evolution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Like Doolittle, he also rejected the possibility that feedback loops could stabilize the system.

[[Lynn Margulis]], a microbiologist who collaborated with Lovelock in supporting the Gaia hypothesis, argued in 1999, that "[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s grand vision was not wrong, only incomplete. In accentuating the direct competition between individuals for resources as the primary selection mechanism, Darwin (and especially his followers) created the impression that the environment was simply a static arena". She wrote that the composition of the Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere are regulated around "set points" as in [[homeostasis]], but those set points change with time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Margulis, Lynn. Symbiotic Planet: A New Look At Evolution. Houston: Basic Book 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary biologist [[W. D. Hamilton]] called the concept of Gaia [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]], adding that it would take another [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] to explain how Gaian self-regulation takes place through Darwinian [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=vanish09&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, pp. 195-197. {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2012|reason=it should be possible to find the original place where Hamilton said this}}

===Criticism in the 21st century===
The Gaia hypothesis continues to be broadly skeptically received by the scientific community. For instance, arguments both for and against it were laid out in the journal ''Climatic Change'' in 2002 and 2003. A significant argument raised against it are the many examples where life has had a detrimental or destabilising effect on the environment rather than acting to regulate it.&lt;ref name="kirchner2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="volk2002"/&gt; Several recent books have criticised the Gaia hypothesis, expressing views ranging from "... the Gaia hypothesis lacks unambiguous observational support and has significant theoretical difficulties"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waltham |first=David |authorlink=David Waltham |date=2014|title=Lucky Planet: Why Earth is Exceptional – and What that Means for Life in the Universe |url=http://www.iconbooks.com/blog/title/lucky-planet/ |location= |publisher=Icon Books |page= |isbn=9781848316560 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to "Suspended uncomfortably between tainted metaphor, fact, and false science, I prefer to leave Gaia firmly in the background"&lt;ref name="beerling2007"/&gt; to "The Gaia hypothesis is supported neither by evolutionary theory nor by the empirical evidence of the geological record".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cockell |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles Cockell |last2=Corfield |first2=Richard |last3=Dise |first3= Nancy  |last4=Edwards |first4=Neil  |last5=Harris |first5=Nigel  |date=2008 |title= An Introduction to the Earth-Life System |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/palaeontology-and-life-history/introduction-earth-life-system |location=Cambridge (UK) |publisher= Cambridge University Press |page= |isbn= 9780521729536 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CLAW hypothesis]],&lt;ref name="CLAW87" /&gt; initially suggested as a potential example of direct Gaian feedback, has subsequently been found to be less credible as understanding of [[cloud condensation nuclei]] has improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1= Quinn |first1=P.K. |last2= Bates |first2=T.S. |title =The case against climate regulation via oceanic phytoplankton sulphur emissions |journal =Nature |volume=480 |pages =51–56 |date = 2011 |doi=10.1038/nature10580|bibcode = 2011Natur.480...51Q |pmid=22129724}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the [[Medea hypothesis]] was proposed: that life has highly detrimental (biocidal) impacts on planetary conditions, in direct opposition to the Gaia hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ward (2009), ''The Medea Hypothesis: Is Life on Earth Ultimately Self-Destructive?'', {{ISBN|0-691-13075-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent book-length evaluation of the Gaia hypothesis considering modern evidence from across the various relevant disciplines the author, Toby Tyrrell, concluded that: "I believe Gaia is a dead end. Its study has, however, generated many new and thought provoking questions. While rejecting Gaia, we can at the same time appreciate Lovelock's originality and breadth of vision, and recognise that his audacious concept has helped to stimulate many new ideas about the Earth, and to champion a holistic approach to studying it".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |authorlink= |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=209 |isbn=9780691121581 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere he presents his conclusion "The Gaia hypothesis is not an accurate picture of how our world works".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Tyrrell |first = Toby |title =Gaia: the verdict is… |journal = New Scientist |volume = 220 |pages = 30–31 |date= 26 October 2013 |doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(13)62532-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement needs to be understood as referring to the "strong" and "moderate" forms of Gaia—that the biota obeys a principle that works to make Earth optimal (strength 5) or favourable for life (strength 4) or that it works as a homeostatic mechanism (strength 3). The latter is the "weakest" form of Gaia that Lovelock has advocated. Tyrrell rejects it. However, he finds that the two weaker forms of Gaia—Coeveolutionary Gaia and Influential Gaia, which assert that there are close links between the evolution of life and the environment and that biology affects the physical and chemical environment—are both credible, but that it is not useful to use the term "Gaia" in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |authorlink= |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=208 |isbn=9780691121581 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4336">'''Human–machine system''' is a [[system]] in which the functions of a human operator (or a group of operators) and a machine are integrated. This term can also be used to emphasize the view of such a system as a single entity that interacts with external environment.

A manual system consists of hand tools and other aids which are coupled by a human operator who controls the operation. Operators of such systems use their own physical energy as the power source{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. The system could range from a person with a hammer to a person with a super-strength giving [[exoskeleton]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.

Human machine system engineering is different from the more general and well known fields like [[human–computer interaction]] and sociotechnical engineering in that it focuses on complex, dynamic control systems that often are partially automated (such as flying an airplane). it also studies human problem-solving in naturalistic settings or in high-fidelity simulation environments. [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Human-machine+systems]

==Human–machine choreography==
The area of human–machine choreography is yet to be extensively explored. How body-structure can be extended through machine mechanisms points to how the body can perform beyond its biological form and functions as well as beyond the local space it inhabits. How human movement is transduced into machine motion and then can be both expressed and extended into virtual performance on the web promises new possibilities in both conceptual approach and aesthetic application. For example, incorporating virtual camera views of the performing human–machine system enriches the choreography and intensifies the artistic result. [http://crossings.tcd.ie/issues/1.2/Stelarc/]

==The Muscle Machine==
The Muscle Machine is a hybrid human–robot walking machine. Designed by artist James Stelarc (who has also created other such systems), it is an exoskeleton with six robotic legs that are controlled by the leg and hand movements of its pilot.

===Mechanism===
The rubber muscles contract when inflated and extend when exhausted. This results in a more reliable and robust engineering design. The body stands on the ground within the chassis of the machine, which incorporates a lower body exoskeleton connecting it to the robot. Encoders on the hip joints provides the data that will allow the human controller to move and direct the machine as well as vary the speed at which it will travel. The action of the human operator lifting a leg lifts the three alternate machine legs and swings them forward. By turning its torso, the body makes the machine walk in the direction it is facing. Thus the interface and interaction is more direct, allowing an intuitive human-machine choreography. The walking system, with attached accelerometer sensors generates data that is converted to sounds that augment the acoustical pneumatics and machine mechanism operation. Once the machine is in motion, it is no longer applicable to ask whether the human or machine is in control as they become fully integrated and move as one. The six-legged robot both extends the body and transforms its bipedal gait into a 6-legged insect-like movement. The appearance and movement of the machine legs are  both limb-like and wing-like motion. [http://www.stelarc.va.com.au/documents/zombiesandcyborgs.pdf]

==In popular culture==
Human–machine systems have been portrayed in the media on many accounts. [[Cyborgs]], seen in movies such as [[The Terminator]] and [[Robocop]], are fantastical depictions of what human-machine systems may, one day, look like. [http://sociologyindex.com/cyborgs.htm]

The '''Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary''' refers to a [[biblical commentary]] entitled a ''Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible'', prepared by Robert Jamieson, [[Andrew Robert Fausset]] and [[David Brown (Free Church of Scotland)|David Brown]] and published in 1871; and derived works from this initial publication, in differing numbers of volumes and abridgements. The commentary uses the [[King James Version of the Bible]] as its text.

==Background==
Robert Jamieson D.D. (1802–1880) was a minister at St. Paul’s Church, [[Provanmill]] in [[Glasgow]]. Andrew Fausset, A.M. (1821–1910) was rector of [[St Cuthbert's Church, York|St. Cuthbert’s Church]] in [[York (England)|York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/fausset_ar|title=A. R. Fausset - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|work=[[Christian Classics Ethereal Library]]|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Brown (1803–1897) was a [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] minister at St. James, Glasgow, and professor of [[theology]] at [[Christ's College, Aberdeen|Free Church College]] of the [[University of Aberdeen]].

The writers described their work as:

:[a] humble effort to make Scripture expound itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/jamieson-fausset-brown/revelation/revelation-22.html|title=Revelation 22 Commentary - Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible|website=Bible Study Tools|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:1 -

1. In the beginning — a period of remote and unknown antiquity, hid in the depths of eternal ages; and so the phrase is used in {{bibleverse||Proverbs|8:22-23|KJV}}:

&lt;blockquote&gt;God — the name of the Supreme Being, signifying in Hebrew, "Strong," "Mighty." It is expressive of omnipotent power; and by its use here in the plural form, is obscurely taught at the opening of the Bible, a doctrine clearly revealed in other parts of it, namely, that though God is one, there is a plurality of persons in the Godhead — Father, Son, and Spirit, who were engaged in the creative work ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 8:27; [[Gospel of John|John]] 1:3, 10; [[Letter to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 3:9; [[Letter To the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 1:2; [[Book of Job|Job]] 26:13).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Keeling Curve''' is a graph of the accumulation of [[carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere]] based on continuous measurements taken at the [[Mauna Loa Observatory]] on the island of [[Hawaii]] from 1958 to the present day. The curve is named for the scientist [[Charles David Keeling]], who started the monitoring program and supervised it until his death in 2005. 

Keeling's measurements showed the first significant evidence of rapidly increasing [[carbon dioxide]] levels in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/history_legacy/early_keeling_curve|title=The Early Keeling Curve {{!}} Scripps CO2 Program|website=scrippsco2.ucsd.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Dr [[Naomi Oreskes]], Professor of History of Science at [[Harvard University]], the Keeling curve is one of the most important scientific works of the [[20th century]].&lt;ref name="clidis"&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENvJ2WqxNgQ|title=Climate Disruption|date=23 January 2017|people=Naomi Oreskes|language=English|publisher=Awesome Documentaries TV|trans-title=|access-date=27 August 2017|medium=video}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scientists credit the Keeling curve with first bringing the world's attention to the current increase of [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nisbet|first=Euan|date=2007|title=Cinderella science|url=https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/co2conference/Reporters/EarthmonitoringCinderellascience_Nature.pdf|journal=Nature|volume=450|pages=789-790|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Background ==
Prior to the 1950s, measurements of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] concentrations had been taken on an [[ad hoc]] basis at a variety of locations. In 1938, engineer and amateur meteorologist [[Guy Stewart Callendar]] compared datasets of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] from Kew in 1898-1901, which averaged 274 parts per million by volume ([[Parts-per_notation|ppmv]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Horace Tabberer|last2=Escombe|first2=F.|date=1905|title=On the variations in the amount of carbon dioxide in the air of Kew during the years 1898-1901|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/76/507/118|journal=Proc.

B|language=en|volume=76|issue=507|pages=118–121|doi=10.1098/rspb.1905.0004|issn=0950-1193|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and from the eastern [[United States]] in 1936-1938, which averaged 310 [[Parts-per_notation|ppmv]], and concluded that [[carbon dioxide]] concentrations were rising due to anthropogenic emissions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callendar|first=Guy Stewart|date=1938|title=The artificial production of carbon dioxide and its influence on temperature|url=https://www.eas.ualberta.ca/jdwilson/EAS372_15/exams/Callendar_QJRMS1938.pdf|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|volume=64|pages=223-240|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, [[Guy Stewart Callendar|Callendar]]'s findings were not widely accepted by the scientific community due to the patchy nature of the measurements.&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Perspectives on Climate Change|last1=Fleming|first1=James Rodger|date=1998|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0195078705|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.aip.org/history/climate/co2.htm#SC|title=The Carbon Dioxide Greenhouse Effect|website=history.aip.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Charles David Keeling]], of [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] at [[UC San Diego]], was the first person to make frequent regular measurements of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) concentrations at the [[South Pole]], and on [[Mauna Loa]], [[Hawaii]] from March 1958 onwards.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Daniel C.|date=2010|title=Charles David Keeling and the Story of Atmospheric CO2 Measurements|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ac1001492|journal=Analytical Chemistry|volume=82|issue=19|pages=7865–7870|doi=10.1021/ac1001492|issn=0003-2700|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles David Keeling|Keeling]] had optimized the measurement techniques at three locations: [[Big Sur]] near [[Monterey]], rain forests of the [[Olympic Peninsula]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]], and high mountain forests in [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He observed strong [[Diurnal cycle|diurnal]] behavior of [[carbon dioxide]], with excess [[carbon dioxide]] at night due to [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] by plants and soils, and afternoon values representative of the "free atmosphere" over the [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern hemisphere]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

==Mauna Loa measurements==
[[File:Mauna Loa Observatory from air.jpg|The Mauna Loa Observatory|thumb|400x400px|alt=]]In 1957-1958, the [[International Geophysical Year]], Keeling obtained funding from the [[Weather Bureau]] to install [[Infrared gas analyzer|infrared gas analyzers]] at remote locations, including the [[South Pole]] and on the volcano of [[Mauna Loa]] on [[Hawaii (island)|the island of Hawaii]]. [[Mauna Loa]] was chosen as a long-term monitoring site due to its remote location far from continents and its lack of vegetation. Keeling and his collaborators measured the incoming ocean breeze above the [[Inversion (meteorology)|thermal inversion layer]] to minimize local contamination from volcanic vents.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The data were [[normalization (statistics)|normalized]] to remove any influence from local contamination. Due to funding cuts in the mid-1960s, [[Charles David Keeling|Keeling]] was forced to abandon continuous monitoring efforts at the South Pole, but he scraped together enough money to maintain operations at the [[Mauna Loa Observatory]], which have continued to the present day&lt;ref name="rewards"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keeling|first1=Charles D.|date=1998|title=Rewards and Penalties of Monitoring the Earth|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.energy.23.1.25?casa_token=Y1mTLuAmGeUAAAAA:7bw3PbCyVb1pN-fmnnYX4l9bU0wblzuc-R75QCaGdOuouSaYygWmGn2faVMzNbeQB1SBat-w1A|journal=Annual Review of Energy and the Environment|volume=23|issue=|pages=25–82|doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.23.1.25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. {{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage=  | video1 = Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEbE5fcnFVs The Keeling Curve Animation], Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego|Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego | video2 = Ralph Keeling, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WFCoJgt71A “The (Ralph) Keeling Curve”], Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego | video3 = Dr. John Barnes, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jOAlC2dVtA Mauna Loa Observatory I Exploratorium], [[Exploratorium]] | video4 = Charles David Keeling, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Z7RRKzrdg “The Keeling Curve Turns 50”], Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego}}

[[Charles David Keeling|Kelling]] published the first "Keeling Curve" of monthly [[carbon dioxide]] records from [[Mauna Loa Observatory|Mauna Loa]] from 1958 to 1960 in the journal [[Tellus A|Tellus]] in 1960, and reported that the year-to-year increase in [[carbon dioxide]] roughly matched the amount of [[fossil fuel]]s burned per year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keeling|first=Charles D.|date=1960|title=The concentration and isotopic abundances of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere|url=http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/assets/publications/keeling_tellus_1960.pdf|journal=Tellus|volume=12|pages=200-203|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1976, it was well established that the rising carbon dioxide in the curve was due to anthropogenic emissions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keeling|first=Charles D.|last2=Bacastow|first2=Robert B.|last3=Bainbridge|first3=Arnold E.|last4=Ekdahl Jr.|first4=Carl A.|last5=Guenther|first5=Peter R.|last6=Waterman|first6=Lee S.|last7=Chin|first7=John F.

[[Carbon dioxide]] measurements at the [[Mauna Loa Observatory]] in [[Hawaii]] are made with a type of [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrophotometer]], now known as a [[nondispersive infrared sensor]], that is calibrated using [[World Meteorological Organization]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/about/co2_measurements.pdf|title=How we measure background CO2 levels on Mauna Loa|last=Tans|first=Pieter|last2=Thoning|first2=Kirk|date=March 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of instrument, originally called a [[capnograph|capnograph,]] was first invented by [[John Tyndall]] in 1864, and recorded by pen traces on a strip chart recorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/12/22/science/earth/20101222-carbon/index.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Sampling the Air | date=December 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, several laser-based sensors are being added to run concurrently with the infrared spectrophotometer at [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography|Scripps Institute of Oceanography]], while [[NOAA]] measurements at [[Mauna Loa Observatory|Mauna Loa]] still use the [[nondispersive infrared sensor]].

==Results and interpretation==

The measurements collected at [[Mauna Loa Observatory]] show a steady increase in mean atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] concentration from 313 parts per million by volume ([[Parts-per_notation|ppmv]]) in March 1958 to 406 [[Parts-per notation|ppmv]] in November 2018, with an increase of ~2 [[Parts-per notation|ppmv]] [[carbon dioxide]] per year.&lt;ref name="MaunaMonthly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Recent Monthly Average Mauna Loa CO2|url=http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/|website=Earth System Research Laboratory|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increase in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] is due to the [[combustion]] of [[fossil fuel]]s, and has been accelerating in recent years. Since [[carbon dioxide]] is a [[greenhouse gas]], this has significant implications for [[global warming]]. Measurements of [[carbon dioxide]] concentration in ancient [[air bubble]]s trapped in polar [[ice core]]s show that mean atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] concentration was between 275 and 285 [[Parts-per notation|ppmv]] during the [[Holocene]] epoch (9,000 [[Common Era|BCE]] onwards), but started rising sharply at the beginning of the [[19th century|nineteenth century]].&lt;ref name="Neftel"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neftel|first=A.|authorlink=|last2=Moor|first2=E.|last3=Oeschger|first3=H.|last4=Stauffer|first4=B.|date=1985|title=Evidence from polar ice cores for the increase in atmospheric CO2 in the past two centuries|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/315045a0|journal=Nature|volume=315|issue=6014|pages=45–47|bibcode=|doi=|accessdate=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Keeling Curve also shows a cyclic variation of about 5 [[Parts-per notation|ppmv]] each year corresponding to the seasonal change in uptake of [[carbon dioxide]] by the world's land vegetation. Most of this vegetation is in the [[Northern hemisphere]] where most of the land is located. From a maximum in May, the level decreases during the northern spring and summer as new [[plant]] growth takes carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere through [[photosynthesis]]. After reaching a minimum in September, the level rises again in the northern fall and winter as plants and leaves die off and decay, releasing  [[carbon dioxide]] back into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Legacy ==

=== Global monitoring ===
Due in part to the significance of Keeling's findings,&lt;ref name="rewards" /&gt; [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] began monitoring [[carbon dioxide]] levels worldwide in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Keeling, Charles D. (1978). "The Influence of Mauna Loa Observatory on the Development of Atmospheric CO2 Research". In ''Mauna Loa Observatory: A 20th Anniversary Report''. (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Special Report, September 1978), edited by John Miller, pp. 36-54. Boulder, CO: [[NOAA]] Environmental Research Laboratories.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] levels are monitored at about 100 sites around the globe through the Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/|title=ESRL Global Monitoring Division - Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network|last=Laboratory|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, Earth System Research|website=www.esrl.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements at many other isolated sites have confirmed the long-term trend shown by the Keeling Curve,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/graphics_gallery/other_stations/global_stations_co2_concentration_trends.html Global Stations CO2 Concentration Trends].

=== Ralph Keeling ===
Since [[Charles David Keeling]]'s death in 2005, responsibility and oversight of the project was transferred to Keeling's son, [[Ralph Keeling]]. On the fiftieth anniversary of the beginning of the project, the younger Keeling wrote an article in [[Science (journal)|Science magazine]] describing his father's life and work, along with how the project has grown and evolved over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keeling|first=Ralph F.|date=2008|title=Recording Earth's Vital Signs|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/319/5871/1771|journal=Science|language=en|volume=319|issue=5871|pages=1771–1772|doi=10.1126/science.1156761|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18369129|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with more precise measurement materials and funds for the project of monitoring of the Earth's [[carbon dioxide]] levels, Keeling wrote his pride for his father's work and how he has continued it in his memory.

=== Recognition ===
In 2015, the Keeling Curve was designated a [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|National Historic Chemical Landmark]] by the [[American Chemical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/keeling-curve.html|title=Keeling Curve - American Chemical Society|website=American Chemical Society|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commemorative plaques were installed at [[Mauna Loa Observatory]] and at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

=== Passing 400 ppm in 2013 ===
On May 9, 2013, the daily mean concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere measured at Mauna Loa surpassed 400 parts per million ([[Parts-per notation|ppmv]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Showstack|first=Randy|date=2013|title=Carbon dioxide tops 400 ppm at Mauna Loa, Hawaii|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2013EO210004|journal=Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union|volume=94|issue=21|pages=192–192|doi=10.1002/2013eo210004|issn=0096-3941|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of [[carbon dioxide]] during previous [[Geologic era|geologic eras]] suggest that [[carbon dioxide]] has not reached this level since the [[Pliocene climate|mid-Pliocene]].&lt;ref name="Montaigne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/keeling_curve_son_of_climate_science_pioneer_on_co2_milestone/2650/|title=Son of Climate Science Pioneer Ponders A Sobering Milestone|last1=Montaigne|first1=Fen|website=Yale Environment 360|publisher=Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Lally column''' is a round thin-walled [[structural steel]] [[column]] oriented vertically to provide support to [[Beam (structure)|beams]] or timbers stretching over long [[Span (architecture)|spans]]. The steel shell of a Lally column is filled with [[concrete]], which carries a share of the compression load, and helps prevent local buckling of the shell.  The advantage of a Lally column over conventional structural steel is the ability to cut it to length on a construction site with simple [[hand tool]]s such as a plumber’s [[Pipecutter|pipe cutter]] or a reciprocating saw. Lally columns are generally not as strong or durable as conventional structural steel columns. The term "lally column" is sometimes incorrectly used in reference to other types of [[prefabricated]] steel columns.

The Lally column is named after a U. S. inventor, John Lally, who owned a construction company that started production of these columns in the late 19th century.  He resided in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]] and [[Boston]] during the period 1898–1907.  He was issued four U. S. [[Patent]]s on composite columns: #614729, #869869, #901453, and #905888. Pat. #869869 was assigned to the U. S. Column Company of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

Early Lally columns were made with structural steel, "standard" pipes, with wall thicknesses slightly less than 1/4".  Modern Lally columns are typically made with 16 GA (approx. 0.06") shells.  Modern Lallies are therefore much lower in strength than the older ones (typically less than half the strength), and are also much more subject to damage by corrosion in moist environments.  Modern Lally columns are primarily intended as somewhat stronger and more durable substitutes for wood posts in light-frame wood construction, although they are sometimes also used with steel beams.

'''Laughter in animals''' other than [[human]]s describes [[ethology|animal behavior]] which resembles human [[laughter]].

Several non-human species demonstrate [[Emotion in animals#Vocalisations|vocalizations]] that sound similar to human laughter. A significant proportion of these species are mammals, which suggests that the neurological functions occurred early in the process of mammalian evolution.&lt;ref name="Panksepp2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Panksepp, J.|title=The riddle of laughter neural and psychoevolutionary underpinnings of joy|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2000|volume=9|issue=6|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00090|pages=183–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apes==
[[Chimpanzee]]s, [[gorilla]]s, [[bonobo]]s and [[orangutans]] show laughter-like vocalizations in response to physical contact such as wrestling, play chasing or [[Tickling#Physiology|tickling]]. This behavior is documented in wild and captive chimpanzees. [[Chimpanzee#Laughter in apes|Chimpanzee laughter]] is not readily recognizable to humans as such, because it is generated by alternating inhalations and exhalations that sound more like breathing and panting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/090604-apes-laugh-tickle-chimps-gorillas.html|title=Apes Laugh, Tickle Study Finds|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It sounds similar to screeching. The differences between chimpanzee and human laughter may be the result of adaptations that have evolved to enable human speech. One study{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} analyzed sounds made by human babies and bonobos when tickled. It found that although the bonobo’s laugh was a higher frequency, the laugh followed the same sonographic pattern of human babies to include as similar facial expressions. Humans and chimpanzees share similar ticklish areas of the body such as the armpits and belly.

Research has noted the similarity in forms of laughter among humans and apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans) when tickled, suggesting that laughter derived from a common origin among primate species, and therefore [[evolution|evolved]] prior to the origin of humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8083230.stm "Tickled apes yield laughter clue"], BBC, June 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2009.05.028 | volume=19 | title=Reconstructing the Evolution of Laughter in Great Apes and Humans | journal=Current Biology | pages=1106–1111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rats==
[[Image:Rattus norvegicus 1.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Brown rats emit 50-kHz calls during rough and tumble play, and when tickled.]]
[[Rat]]s emit long, 50-kHz [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] calls that are induced during rough and tumble play, and when tickled by humans. The vocalization is described as distinct "chirping".  Like humans, rats have "tickle skin", areas of the body that generate greater laughter responses than others. Rats that laugh the most also play the most and prefer to spend more time with other laughing rats.  It has been reported that there is no decline in the tendency to laugh and respond to tickle skin as rats age, however, it has also been reported that in females, brain maturation after puberty appears to redefine tickling as aversive, leading to avoidance rather than appetitive responses.&lt;ref name="Paredes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paredes-Ramos|first1=P.|last2=Miquel|first2=M.|last3=Manzo|first3=J.|last4=Pfaus|first4=J.G.|last5=López-Meraz|first5=M.L.|last6=Coria-Avila|first6=G.A.|year=2012|title=Tickling in juvenile but not adult female rats conditions sexual partner preference|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=107|issue=1|pages=17–25|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2012.05.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies show that rats chirp when wrestling one another, before receiving morphine, or when mating.  The sound has been interpreted as an expectation of something rewarding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20010728/fob9.asp Science News 2001 - requires signup]&lt;/ref&gt; High frequency ultrasonic vocalizations are important in rat communication and function to elicit approach behavior in the recipient.&lt;ref name="Wohr"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wöhr|first1=M.|last2=Schwarting|first2=R.K.|year=2007|title=Ultrasonic communication in rats: Can playback of 50-kHz calls induce approach behavior?|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=2|issue=12|pages=e1365|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001365|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial goal of research by [[Jaak Panksepp]] and Jeff Burgdorf was to track the biological origins of how the brain processes emotions and social behavior.  They compared rat vocalizations during social interactions to the joy and laughter commonly experienced by children in social play. They concluded that the 50-kHz rat vocalizations might reflect positive [[Affect (psychology)|affective state]]s (feelings or emotions), analogous to those experienced by children laughing during social play.&lt;ref name="Panksepp2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panksepp|first1=J.|last2=Burgdorf|first2=J.|year=2003|title="Laughing" rats and the evolutionary antecedents of human joy?|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=79|issue=3|pages=533–547|url=http://caspar.bgsu.edu/~courses/Reading/Papers/2003PanBur.pdf|doi=10.1016/s0031-9384(03)00159-8|pmid=12954448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent studies have investigated the emotional states of rats after being tickled.  An animal's optimism or pessimism can be assessed by [[Cognitive bias in animals|cognitive bias]] studies. After being tickled, rats are more optimistic, indicating the interaction invokes a positive affective state.&lt;ref name="Rygula"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rygula|first1=R.|last2=Pluta|first2=H.|last3=Popik|first3=P.|year=2012|title=Laughing rats are optimistic|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=12|pages=e51959|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0051959|pmid=23300582|pmc=3530570}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, rats self-administer playback of the 50-kHz trill calls and avoid playback of 22-kHz calls.&lt;ref name="Burgdorf"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burgdorf|first1=J.|last2=Kroes|first2=R.A.|last3=Moskal|first3=J.R.|last4=Pfaus|first4=J.G.|last5=Brudzynski|first5=S.M.|last6=Panksepp|first6=J.|year=2008|title=Ultrasonic vocalizations of rats (Rattus norvegicus) during mating, play, and aggression: Behavioral concomitants, relationship to reward, and self-administration of playback|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=122|issue=4|pages=357–367|doi=10.1037/a0012889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When rats are given [[naloxone]] (an [[opioid]] antagonist), tickling no longer evokes the 50-kHz vocalisation which indicates that the rewarding properties of tickling are modulated by endogenous opioids.

==Dogs==
[[Dog]]s sometimes pant in a manner that sounds like a human laugh. By analyzing the pant using a [[sonograph]], this pant varies with bursts of frequencies. When this vocalization is played to dogs in a shelter setting, it can initiate play, promote pro-social behavior, and decrease stress levels.  One study compared the behaviour of 120 dogs with and without exposure to a recorded "dog-laugh".  Playback reduced stress-related behaviors, increased tail wagging, the display of a "play-face" when playing was initiated, and pro-social behavior such as approaching and lip licking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Simonet, P.|author2=Versteeg, D.|author3=Storie, D.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2005|title=Dog-laughter: Recorded playback reduces stress related behavior in shelter dogs|journal=Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Environmental Enrichment|url=http://www.petalk.org/LaughingDog.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dolphins==
In 2004, researchers who were studying dolphins in Sweden noticed a particular set of sounds that they hadn't heard before.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dolphincommunicationproject.org/pdf/MS-IV-BlomqvistC-041121.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These sounds consisted of a short burst of pulses, followed by a whistle. After further observations the researchers discovered that these signals were only being made by dolphins during play-fighting, and never during aggressive confrontations. Their conclusion was that these sounds were being made by the dolphins to indicate that the situation was pleasant and/or non-threatening, and to help prevent it escalating into something like a real fight. This, according to psychologists, is the reason why laughter exists in the first place, suggesting these noises were the dolphin equivalent of a human laugh.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/nov/17/tickling-rats-giggling-dolphins-do-animals-sense-humour&lt;/ref&gt;

Public legal education, sometimes called civics education, comprises a range of activities intended to build public awareness and skills related to [[law]] and the justice system. This term also refers to the fields of practice and [[wikt:study|study]] concerned with those activities, and to a social and professional [[social movement|movement]] that advocates greater societal commitment to [[education|educating]] people about the law. Anna-Marie Marshall explains that  "in order to realize their rights, people need to take the initiative to articulate them. This initiative, in turn, depends on the availability and the relevance of legal schema to people confronting problems." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=Anna-Marie|title=Idle Rights: Employees’ Rights Consciousness and the Construction of Sexual Harassment Policies.|journal=Law and Society Review|date=2005|volume=39|issue=1|pages=83–124|doi=10.1111/j.0023-9216.2005.00078.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because laws exist as part of a larger organizational ecosystem in which the interests of the organization as well as those of the actors become inextricably linked to the ways in which they are enacted.
 
Distinct from the education of students in [[law school]] seeking a degree in law (which is often simply called "[[legal education]]") and the [[continuing education#Continuing education for professionals|continuing professional education]] of [[lawyer]]s and [[judge]]s (which is sometimes called "[[continuing legal education]]"), public legal education is principally aimed at people who are not lawyers, judges, or degree-seeking law students.

The term "public legal education" (PLE) is related to, and may encompass, several similar terms.&lt;ref&gt;

The term "law-related education" (LRE) usually refers to public legal education in [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] schools (and sometimes in [[higher education]]), as opposed to PLE for adults and outside of school.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, Wanda (2000). "Law-Related Education: Promoting Awareness, Participation, and Action", 297–98, in ''Weaving Connections: Educating for Peace, Social and Environmental Justice'' (Tara Goldstein &amp; David Selby, eds.). {{ISBN|1-894549-01-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
According to the [[American Bar Association]], Commission on Public Understanding, legal awareness is, "the ability to make critical judgments about the substance of the law, the legal process, and available legal resources and to effectively utilize the legal system and articulate strategies to improve it is legal literacy".&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

The [[Canadian Bar Association]] (1992, 23) defines legal literacy as, "the ability to understand words used in a legal context, to draw conclusions from them, and then to use those conclusions to take action."&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Good Citizens: Literacy Training in Anxious Time. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2014. Project MUSE. Web. Feb. 2015. &lt;http://muse.jhu.edu/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

With little change to the Multiple Action Research Group's(MARG, an NGO working for the promotion of legal awareness) definition, legal awareness can be defined as, "critical knowledge of legal provisions and processes, coupled with the skills to use this knowledge to respect and realize rights and entitlements".&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;&lt;ref name="MARG"&gt;[http://www.ngo-marg.org/legal-awareness Multiple Action Research Group - Justice through research empowerment] (Accessed on 2 Apr 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought, philosophy, and different approaches to legal literacy==

The "continuum approach" considers legal literacy as, "a capacity spread along a continuum, with lawyers and judges at one end and relatively incapable laypersons at the other". This approach was adopted by the legal scholar White who considered legal literacy to mean, "that degree of competence in legal discourse required for meaningful and active life in our increasingly [[legal culture|legalistic and litigious culture]]".&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

Author Bilder (1999) defines legal literacy as a, "spectrum of functional skills", related to the conduct of [[litigation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (Bilder1999, 51)&lt;/ref&gt; The continuum approach explains, "a certain degree of legal literacy is required for effective participation in modern society, but it is not necessary for the average citizen to reach the professional standard of 'thinking (and writing) like a lawyer.'"&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

One of the recent approaches considers legal literacy as a metaphor. According to this view, the term is "intended to suggest some parallels between the institution of the law, and a system of language to be mastered, knowledge gained and understanding achieved".&lt;ref&gt;(Manley-Casimir, Michael E., Wanda M. Cassidy, and Suzanne de Castell 1986, 47)&lt;/ref&gt; These authors suggest that the term legal literacy can also function as a model for educators who seek to promote such literacy. Proponents of legal literacy may thus look to the teaching of language for guidance.&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

==Need and importance==
Anoop Kumar, a researcher of Legal Literacy Mission, says in his study, "the legislature of the state and the parliament, while enacting the legislation, consider the objectives of it. Some laws lay down the substantive rights of the masses and some touch upon the procedural aspect of certain laws. But it is due to lack of awareness of beneficiaries that most of the legislations are ineffective at the stage of their execution."&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Anoop, Social science research network National Legal Literacy Mission - An Evaluative Analysis {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.2240008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beljaars, Ben. "Implementing Legal Information Literacy: A Challenge for the Curriculum", International Journal of Legal Information. Journal. Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal awareness can empower people to demand justice, accountability and effective remedies at all levels.&lt;ref name=MARG/&gt; Legal needs always stand to become crisis oriented because their ignorance prevents them from anticipating legal troubles and approaching a lawyer for consultation and advice in time. This magnifies the impact of their legal troubles and difficulties when they come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hslsa.nic.in/Resume.htm Justice P.N. Bhagwati, In 1986, in case of Sukhdas V. Union Territory of Arunachal Pradesh, reported in AIR 1986 S.C. at page 991, Justice P.N. Bhagwat]&lt;/ref&gt;

Without (legal) literacy people can get intimidated and alienated from law. This may evolve into a situation which results in people coming into conflict with the law, or being unable to obtain help from it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (Canadian Bar Association 1992)]&lt;/ref&gt; Courts have acknowledged the barrier raised by a lack of literacy to asserting guaranteed rights effectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (The John Howard Society of Canada1996)]&lt;/ref&gt; Low literacy may block people’s access to justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (Council of Canadian Administrative Tribunals 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; At times, literacy requirements have been used to block access to rights and benefits&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (South Carolina v.

In ''Reading the Legal World'', author Laird Hunter expects legal literacy to achieve:&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;Kumar, Anoop, National Legal Literacy Mission - An Evaluative Analysis (March 26, 2013). {{DOI|10.2139/ssrn.2240008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"People using the legal system must be able to guide themselves through a process that they understand [...] and, at appropriate places along the way"
*recognize they have a [[Natural and legal rights|legal right]] or [[Law of obligations|responsibility]], in order to exercise or assume it;
*recognize when a problem or conflict is a legal conflict and when a legal solution is available;
*know how to take the necessary action to avoid problems and where this is not possible, how to help themselves appropriately;
*know how and where to find information on the law, and be able to find information that is accessible to them,
* know when and how to obtain suitable legal assistance;
* have confidence that the legal system will provide a remedy, and
* understand the process clearly enough to perceive that justice has been done

Depending on the goals there can be a number of objectives for legal literacy programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawforlife.org.uk/introduction/cambodian-community-empowerment-and-legal-awareness-programme,10181,FP.html retrieved 31 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods adopted to promote legal awareness===
There have been many cases where governments have promoted long-term legal literacy missions or awareness campaigns. An example of this is when institutions arrange legal literacy events.

Legal awareness is also achieved through camps, lectures, and interactive workshops or crash programs on the essential and elementary legal laws. Among the general public, many wish to spend time listening to scholars on contemporary issues that have significant bearing on the rights and livelihood of ordinary people.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt; Other methods are road shows, radio talks, street and theatre plays, as well as the publication of relevant books, periodicals, posters, and charts that deal with particular laws, the distribution of pamphlets, brochures, and stickers, the display of paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Aid and Literacy Cell|url=http://www.symlaw.ac.in/legal-aid-and-literacy-cell.php|website=symlaw.ac.in|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrations in comics,&lt;ref name="morungexpress"&gt;{{cite news|title = Legal awareness through grassroots comics|url = http://www.morungexpress.com/local/124381.html|accessdate = 8 December 2014|publisher = morungexpress.com|date = November 11, 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141211044243/http://www.morungexpress.com/local/124381.html|archive-date = 11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other ways to ensure publicity for various [[legal mobilisation]] activities.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt;

Strategically located display boards in public places (railway stations, bus stations, market places, in front of major government offices and police stations) are also used to help government officials, police, and the public to understand the spirit of law.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt;

==Obstacles==
According to Lorenzo Cotula, laws are usually published in the official gazette, few people outside legal circles have access to [[legal information]].&lt;ref name=Cotula&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotula|first1=Lorenzo|title=Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control: Securing Local Resource Rights Within Foreign Investment Projects in Africa|date=1 Jan 2007|publisher=IIED, 2007|isbn=9781843696674|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-72KOAj92UgC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=legal%20awareness&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q=legal%20awareness&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illiteracy,&lt;ref name="Cotula" /&gt; economic barriers,&lt;ref name="UNSG"&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Poverty/A-67-278.pdf  " Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights" page 6 from Note by the Secretary-General on Extreme poverty and human rights for UN GA 67th session A67/278 Distri:General 9 Aug 2012]  www.ohchr.org webpage retrieved 30 March 2013 16.00 IST&lt;/ref&gt; language barriers, social taboos&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=irvxAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Obstacles+in+%22legal+awareness%22&amp;dq=Obstacles+in+%22legal+awareness%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5xBXUffCA4fXrQeHhIGoAg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgo Arise: A Women's Developmental Magazine Published by Acfode, Issues 2-16 ] snippet view as seen/referred to on 30 March 2013 on Google books&lt;/ref&gt; and a lack of zeal among the legal fraternity may lead to obstacles in gaining requisite levels of legal literacy. According to Hanna Hasl-Kelchner, at times lack of zeal among lawyers make them prone to saying no and killing a deal rather than working through the issues and finding solutions that are both practical and legally sound.&lt;ref name="HannaHK"&gt;{{cite book| first = Hanna | last = Hasl-Kelchner| title = The business guide to legal literacy: what every manager should know about the law| isbn = 9780787982553 | year = 2006| pages = 1–12 &amp; inside flap page|accessdate=9 Nov 2013| url = http://www.legalliteracybooktour.com/LegalLiteracy-FreeChapters.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a note to the UN General Assembly 67th session, the UN Secretary General states, "the deprivations that persons living in poverty encounter throughout their lives — lack of access to quality education, reduced access to information, limited political voice and social capital — translate into lower levels of legal literacy and awareness of their rights, creating social obstacles to seeking redress".&lt;ref name=UNSG/&gt;

The absence of a [[legal culture]] and the resulting illiteracy are the main reasons for the large number of cases in the courts. If the accused citizen knows that an act is a crime punishable by law, they may not do it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://main.omanobserver.om/node/89239 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130413235533/http://main.omanobserver.om/node/89239 |archivedate=2013-04-13 |df= }} website retrieved 30 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the domain of law a vast category of users need to exchange [[legal information]] worldwide and carry out activities in a context where a common understanding of law beyond language is highly desirable. However, this requirement is hard to meet, due to the variety of languages and modes in which the legal discourse is expressed as well as to the diversity of legal orders and the legal concepts on which these systems are founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webfolder.eurac.edu/EURAC/LexALP_shared/media/Peruginelli.pdf Multilingual Legal Information Access: an Overview- Ginevra Peruginelli] Retrieved 30 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

About lesser significance to legal literacy in US legal education, Leonard J. Long professor of law, [[Quinnipiac University School of Law]] says, "law students, law firms, consumers of legal services, and society as a whole would benefit from having a legal profession comprised and dominated by people who are literate in American law, its history, and its jurisprudence. But legal literacy is not promoted mainly because it is not viewed as necessary for the practice of law. This is part of the anti-intellectual tradition in American law generally, and in American legal education specifically".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.siu.edu/journal/34fall/1%20-%20Long.pdf RESISTING ANTI -INTELLECTUALISM AND PROMOTING LEGAL LITERACY by Leonard J.

Corporate, institutions and NGOs are subject to and are supposed to follow various sets of laws.&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;

===Corporate legal literacy===
Legal awareness is an important part of professional work life.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=1T5BHBHNNN0C&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=%22legal+awareness%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j2--T8XgEY3JrQeY-qW1DQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBTi0AQ&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Akula, when law-sensitive issues arise, corporate executives often find themselves in what is, for them, unmapped territory, often without requisite law training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iedp.com/Blog/Importance_Legal_Literacy_Executives_MITSloan The Importance of Legal Literacy for Executives-John Akula, Senior lecturer in Law at MIT Sloan School of Management] Retrieved 31 March 2013 13.00pm IST&lt;/ref&gt; When corporate executives work with attorneys they need to develop a common language to bridge probable communication gaps to achieve legal astituteness.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=I2ezeH8IpSgC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq=need+of+legal+literacy+to+corporate+executives&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qO9XUcrEJ4OsrAeM5YGgCQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=need%20of%20legal%20literacy%20to%20corporate%20executives&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hanna Hasl-Kelchner, legal literacy can help to bridge the gap between law and business by simplifying legal terms into language that makes business sense and offers a new way to think about the law as a useful business tool.&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;
She says, "corporate legal literacy involves balanced understanding of cross disciplinary influences bringing in legal risk exposure, avoiding lawsuits and transforming potential business legal issues that threaten growth and profitability, into opportunities for building stronger business relationships, delivering sustainable stakeholder value, improving competitive advantage and foremost embedding compliance into the corporate culture to achieve organizational excellence".&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;

According to Hasl-Kelchner, corporate legal literacy tackles companies' legal risk profiles on both the employee and organizational levels. There is a need to identify the infrastructure needed to support legal literacy and promote effective communications throughout the organization.&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;

===Institutional legal literacy===
George Pulikuthiyil, executive director of NGO Jananeethi in his essay ''Legal Literacy for Social Empowerment'' says that, 'Well educated and highly placed professionals too are often not aware of provisions in laws and implications of their violations. Many would not know the nitty-gritty of several statutory laws and their applications.&amp;nbsp;... However, the fact remains that vast majority of the officers and professionals like clinical psychologists, therapeutic counsellors, welfare officers, social workers, institutional heads and academia are ignorant of their role and responsibilities as contemplated in the Act. NGOs do take pains to organize workshops to sensitize them with respect to such new generation legislations wherein the pro-active role of various stake holders are great significance.' &lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pulikuthiyil|first1=George|title=Legal Literacy for Social Empowerment|url=http://www.jananeethi.org/jananeethi/reports/esseylegalliteracy.htm|publisher=jananeethi.org/|accessdate=2 December 2014|quote=Bare-foot lawyers/para-legal activists"There may be para-legal workers specially trained in specific thrust areas like minorities, indigenous people, child rights, gender issues, right to information, consumer rights, torture and custodial violence etc. "}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Pulikuthiyil further believes non-governmental organizations, community-based organizations, faith groups, various service providers, trade unions, youth clubs, police personnel, elected representatives to local bodies, PG students of social work and service organizations also have larger scope of improving the quality of life provided they are made conversant with respective legislations.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt;

===Designated legal officers===
Apart from external legal advisors, [[General counsel|internal legal officers]]&lt;ref name="ACC"&gt;The 2011 In-House Counsel Compensation Survey, Question 10,[http://www.acc.com/chapters/socal/upload/2011-In-House-Counsel-Compensation-Survey_4-13-11.pdf] Profiles of In-House Counsel 2006 [http://www.acc.com/vl/public/Surveys/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;amp;pageid=16297] Who Does Your Counsel Report To? (2001) (The Majority Report to the CEO)[http://www.acc.com/legalresources/resource.cfm?show=145939]&lt;/ref&gt;  and in certain countries like Australia and India, The [[company secretary]] is responsible for advising on good governance practices and compliance of corporate governance norms as prescribed under various corporate, securities and other business laws, regulations and guidelines made thereunder.&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;[http://www.companysecretary.com.au/articles/WhatIsCS.pdf What is a Company Secretary?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=csindia&gt;[http://www.icsi.edu/Student/ROLEOFCOMPANYSECRETARY.aspx ROLE OF COMPANY SECRETARY]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==
There are certain related concepts including [[legal consciousness]], [[legal mobilization]] and [[legal socialization]], [[Empowerment#Legal empowerment|legal empowerment]], that helps to put legal literacy in perspective.&lt;ref name="www2.athabascau.ca"/&gt;

===Civics and socio-legal literacy===
Despite semantic proximity education of [[civics]], civics literacy and legal literacy are not exactly the same. In the "legal literacy" semantic components are the dominant notion of the "right," "law," "responsibility to the law," and "civic literacy" added to them the concept of "civil society", "individual rights and freedoms" and "man's responsibility to civil society".&lt;ref&gt;http://academia.lndb.lv/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/1173/natalia-gendina-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the formal civic education system, human rights can be taken up as a part of civic education, values education and social studies, though they may have the limitation of presenting only certain aspects of human rights rather than their integrated whole, and duties of citizens may be overly emphasized to the detriment of certain rights and freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hurights.or.jp/english/education/overview-human-rights-education-in-the-asia-pacific.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At the elementary school level, usually minimal level legal literacy introduction is taught through [[civics]], but which is not necessarily adequate for the rest of life.&lt;ref name="Civic Education, Crittenden &amp; Levine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crittenden|first1=Jack|last2=Levine|first2=Peter|title=Civic Education|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/civic-education/|website=plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=22 June 2017|page=Para 2 and also para 1|date=27 December 2007&lt;!--substantive revision Thu May 30, 2013--&gt;|quote=Paragraph no. 2  Nevertheless, most scholarship that uses the phrase “civic education” investigates deliberate programs of instruction within schools or colleges,...........Nevertheless, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that civic education takes place at all stages of life and in many venues other than schools.  also Para 1  ...It is certainly not limited to schooling and the education of children and youth. Families, governments, religions, and mass media are just some of the institutions involved in civic education, understood as a lifelong process.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied legal education is imparted through business and commerce school and some other branches. News media also plays a part, but is unable to meet all socio-legal literacy needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=J.|last1=Deepika|first2=D.|last2=Ratna Kumari|title=A Study on Awareness on Legal Acts of Consumer Protection among Students|journal=International Journal of Science and Research |date=November 2014|volume=3|issue=11|url=http://www.ijsr.net/archive/v3i11/T0NUMTQxMjgw.pdf|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NGOs and legal aid centres may provide for limited legal literacy related to specific thrust areas.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil /&gt;

==Legal literacy mission==
[[People's Republic of China|China]] conducts Nationwide Legal Awareness Raising Campaigns (NLARC) this five-year program has been conducted since 1986.&lt;ref name=Baodong&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baodong|first1=Li|chapter=Human rights Education in China|editor1-last=Grimheden|editor1-first=Jonas|editor2-last=Ring|editor2-first=Rolf|title=Essays in Honour of Göran Melander|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2006|location=Sweden|page=49|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I-xjduHi7F8C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=Legal+awareness#v=onepage&amp;q=Legal%20awareness&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2014|isbn=9004151818|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;   National Legal Services Authority (India) conducted a five-year nationwide "National Legal Literacy Mission" from 2005 to 2010.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnis.org/news.php?issue_id=8&amp;volume_id=3&amp;news_id=389&amp;i=2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet and legal literacy==
The Internet as a [[legal research|legal research tool]] is advantageous for most primary legal research materials, which can be located for free to supplement fee-based services and library collections. The Internet offers increased access to resources, low- or no-cost access, and real-time information via social media.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aallnet.org/main-menu/Publications/products/Law-Librarians-Making-Information-Work/pll-guide-5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Roger Smith, an expert in domestic and international aspects of legal aid, human rights and access to justice;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Author: Roger Smith|url=http://www.legalvoice.org.uk/author/roger-smith/|website=http://www.legalvoice.org.uk/|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; says in his article "IT changes bring hope – and hype", that Technology offers the opportunity significantly to cut costs and to leverage existing provision.&lt;ref name="Roger Smith"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Roger|title=IT changes bring hope – and hype|url=http://www.legalvoice.org.uk/changes-bring-hope-hype/|website=www.legalvoice.org.uk/|publisher=www.legalvoice.org.uk/|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Roger Smith further believes there is enough to suggest potential usage of internet and its interactive capacities of internet in information sharing.&lt;ref name="Roger Smith" /&gt; According to Roger Smith  (Internet and) Technology  also opens up the possibility of providing ‘just in time’ public legal education which might just be the answer to the yawning gap in family law advice.&lt;ref name="Roger Smith" /&gt; Roger Smith further says 'technology can be used to construct a network of (online legal) provision which provides the level of legal advice and assistance to which people are entitled - even in times of austerity.'&lt;ref name="Roger Smith" /&gt;

Founded in 1992 by [[Peter Martin (Law Professor)|Peter Martin]] and [[Thomas R. Bruce|Tom Bruce]], [[Legal Information Institute]] ('''LII''') a [[non-profit]], public service of [[Cornell Law School]] that provides no-cost access to current [[American law|American]] and [[international law|international]] [[legal research]] sources online at [http://law.cornell.edu law.cornell.edu] is a pioneer in the delivery of legal information online.&lt;ref name="Laurence"/&gt;&lt;ref name='Amant'&gt;{{cite book | last = St. Amant| first = Kirk | title = Handbook of Research on Open Source Software: Technological, Economic, and Social Perspectives | publisher = IGI Global | year = 2007| pages = 375 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=75KT6GdcWbYC&amp;pg=PA375&amp;dq=%22legal+information+institute%22+1992&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22legal%20information%20institute%22%201992 | isbn = 1-59140-999-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Stefanou'&gt;{{cite book | last = Stefanou | first = Constantin |author2=Helen Xanthaki  | title = Drafting legislation: a modern approach | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | year = 2008| pages = 272 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=xMyItDp8TIwC&amp;lpg=PA272&amp;dq=%22peter%20martin%22%20and%20%22tom%20bruce%22&amp;pg=PA272#v=onepage&amp;q=%22peter%20martin%22%20and%20%22tom%20bruce%22 | isbn = 0-7546-4903-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; LII was the first law site developed on the internet.&lt;ref name='Laurence'&gt;{{cite book | last = Laurence | first = Helen |author2=William Miller  | title = Academic research on the Internet: options for scholars and libraries | publisher = Routledge | year = 2000 | pages = 160 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=U3DTGfZkHywC&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=%22legal%20information%20institute%22%20%22cornell%22&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;q=%22legal%20information%20institute%22%20%22cornell%22 | isbn = 0-7890-1177-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public service of Cornell Law School promotes [[Legal Information Institute]] which in turn promotes [[Free Access to Law Movement]] and work on principles adopted at Montral declaration (2002 and amended subsequently); which advocates publishing of public legal information via internet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldlii.org/worldlii/declaration/&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, MARG(Multiple Action Research Group), an organization working for [[empowerment#Legal|empowerment]] is using internet and social networking sites to empower netizens. The organization posts  every Friday "friday facts" in their [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] &amp; [[Instagram]] pages.These posts/pictures focuses on rights of the citizens and all other important information about laws in India.

==Important institutions promoting legal awareness and legal literacy==
[[Bar council]]s, lawyer federations and various NGOs take the lead in promoting legal awareness and legal literacy. In India, as per the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, the [[National Legal Services Authority]] (NLSA) has been designated to take appropriate measures for spreading legal literacy and legal awareness amongst the people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nalsa.gov.in/actrules.html The act as seen on 26 Feb 2013 14.30 GMT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729091927/http://nalsa.gov.in/actrules.html |date=2016-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indiana]], in the United States, Outreach for Legal Literacy (OLL) is a community service program in which law students teach law to fifth-graders in local elementary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.indiana.edu/students/activities/outreach/index.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328142637/http://law.indiana.edu/students/activities/outreach/index.shtml |archivedate=2013-03-28 |df= }} Retrieved 31 March 2013 14.00pm IST&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2478">A '''loose sentence''' (also called a cumulative sentence) is a type of sentence in which the main idea ([[Clause#Independent and dependent clauses|independent clause]]) is elaborated by the successive addition of modifying clauses or phrases.

==Construction==

It adds modifying elements after the subject, complement, and verb.

==Effect==

Loose sentences may make a work seem informal, relaxed, and conversational.  However, according to Strunk and White's ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' (2000), a succession of loose sentences, especially those of two clauses, is to be avoided because of "mechanical symmetry and sing-song".

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* "Bells rang, filling the air with their clangor, startling pigeons into flight from every belfry, bringing people into the streets to hear the news." (From the English Reviewer)
* She drove her car to go to the movies, and got gas.
* "I have been assured by a very knowing American friend of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nourished is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked or boiled; and I make no doubt it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout." Jonathan Swift, [[A Modest Proposal]]

== Alternatives ==
If the writer finds that he has written a series of sentences of the type described, he should recast enough of them to remove the monotony, replacing them by simple sentences, by sentences of two clauses joined by a semicolon, by periodic sentences of two clauses, by sentences, loose or periodic, of three clauses—whichever best represent the real relations of the thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strunk Jr.|first1=William|title=The Elements of Style|date=July 28, 2009|publisher=W L C|isbn=1557427283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if the writer wanted to rewrite the above examples he could write:
* Bells rang. Their resonance filled the air with clangor, startling pigeons into flight from every belfry. Upon hearing the sounds, the townspeople rushed into the streets. They all stood in silence and awaited the news. 
* She drove to the movies. Afterwards she went to the gas station to fill up.

The '''Maria reactor''' is [[Poland]]'s second [[nuclear research reactor]] and the only one still in use. It is located at Świerk-[[Otwock]], near Warsaw and named in honor of [[Maria Skłodowska-Curie]]. It is the only reactor of Polish design.

Maria is a multifunctional research tool, with a notable application in production of [[radioisotope]]s, research with utilization of neutron beams, [[neutron therapy]], and [[neutron activation analysis]]. It operates about 4000 hours annually, usually in blocks of 100 hours.

==Technical description==
The technical details of the reactor are given in the references.&lt;ref&gt;"Reaktor Maria" at the website of the Polish Institute of Atomic Energy  (pl:Instytut Energii Atomowej) "POLATOM" [https://web.archive.org/web/20110228013041/http://www.cyf.gov.pl/reaktor_ang.html (English)] [http://www.iea.cyf.gov.pl/reaktor.html (Polish)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221134737/http://www.iea.cyf.gov.pl/reaktor.html |date=2009-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=krzysztoszek-2007&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/meetings/PDFplus/2007/cn156/cn156presentations/cn156_Krzysztoszek.pdf |title=Maria research reactor conversion to LEU fuel |first=Grzegorz |last=Krzysztoszek |publisher=IAEA |work=Institute of Atomic Energy |year=2007 |accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cyf.gov.pl/nowa/annual_report_pdf/2008/Chapter_1.pdf |title=Operation of Maria Research Reactor |author1=G.

Maria is a [[pool reactor|pool type reactor]] with a power of 20 to 30 MW (thermal). Despite it being a pool reactor, it contains channels (aluminum tubes) individually connected to the primary coolant. The water pool provides cooling for elements (e.g., fuel elements) that are not otherwise cooled, and also acts as radiation shielding. Maria uses [[enriched uranium]] as fuel (80% enrichment in [[U-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]] till year 1999; 36% since). The fuel elements and channels are vertical but arranged conically. Water and [[beryllium]] blocks serve as the moderator (70% and 30% of the moderation, respectively). Elements of [[boron carbide]] sheathed in aluminum are utilized for control, compensation, and safety. The use of beryllium blocks results in a comparatively large fuel lattice pitch, and consequently large volume for payload targets. There is also a [[graphite]] [[neutron reflector|reflector]] (aluminum sheathed). Maria supplies a [[neutron flux]] of 4x10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; n/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;s ([[thermal neutrons]]) and 2x10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; n/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;s ([[fast neutrons]]). There are six horizontal channels for controlled use of neutron beams. There is also a window of lead-containing glass through which the core can be viewed. The reactor is housed in a [[Containment building|sealed containment]].

Following preparation which started in 2004, Maria was converted to use [[Uranium enrichment#Low-enriched uranium (LEU)|low-enriched uranium]] (LEU) fuel by 2012.&lt;ref name=krzysztoszek-2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://nnsa.energy.gov/mediaroom/pressreleases/mariareactor092512 |title=NNSA Helps Poland Convert Reactor, Remove Highly Enriched Uranium |publisher=NNSA |date=25 September 2012 |accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Construction began on June 16, 1970 and the reactor was activated on December 18, 1974. With the shutdown of the [[Ewa reactor]] in 1995 it became Poland's only research nuclear reactor.

==Production of medical radioisotopes==
In February 2010, it was announced that Maria will start producing [[medical isotopes]] in cooperation with [[Covidien]], to help ease the isotope shortages due to shutdowns of the Canadian [[National Research Universal Reactor|NRU reactor]] and the Dutch [[Petten nuclear reactor]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Wawrzyński, "Reaktor Maria ratuje świat", "Gazeta Wyborcza", 2010-02-17 [http://wyborcza.pl/1,75476,7572615,Reaktor_Maria_ratuje_swiat.html (in Polish)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Wald, "Poland emerges as new source of rare medical isotope", [[International Herald Tribune]], 2010-02-18, p.2 [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/health/17isotope.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Money Advice Service''' is an organisation established with cross [[Government]] party support, that provides free and impartial advice on money and financial decisions to people in the United Kingdom. It is an independent organisation whose statutory objectives are to enhance the understanding and knowledge of people about financial matters (including the UK financial system) and to enhance their ability to manage their own financial affairs.  The service provides free money advice and guidance online and by telephone.

The service was launched in April 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK financial advice service launched|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12960667|accessdate=16 March 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; superseding the Moneymadeclear-branded service provided by the [[Consumer Financial Education Body]]. Prior to 2010, the service had been a division of the [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA). It was set up by the UK Government and is paid for by a statutory levy on the financial services industry.&lt;ref name=Milligan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milligan|first1=Brian|title=Budget 2016: Money Advice Service to be abolished|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35820752|accessdate=16 March 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategic goals and direction of the Money Advice Service are set by a 12-member board. The board is appointed by, but acts independently of, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The service has an independent Chairman and board appointed by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA). The FCA’s appointments of the Chair and Chief Executive are subject to the approval of [[HM Treasury]].

In April 2012 the Money Advice Service took on additional responsibility for funding and improving the quality, consistency and availability of UK debt advice, a statutory function as set out in the [[Financial Services Act 2012]].

In March 2017 the Money Advice Service launched the new Standard Financial Statement (SFS), an initiative designed to bring greater consistency to the way organisations assess people’s finances when they are in debt.

The Money Advice Service also lead the work of a wide range of organisations across the public, private and voluntary sectors to develop the UK Financial Capability Strategy
a ten-year plan to address people’s skills and knowledge around money management, their attitudes and motivations that hold them back and their access to products and services.

In March 2016 [[HM Treasury]] announced that the service would become part of a new guidance body that would see the [https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en Money Advice Service], The [[Pensions Advisory Service]] and [[Pension Wise]] combine to form a new single guidance body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35820752|title=Money Advice Service to be abolished|last=Milligan|first=Brian|date=2016-03-16|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [https://services.parliament.uk/bills/2017-19/financialguidanceandclaims.html Financial Guidance and Claims Bill] seeks to establish the new statutory body by [[Royal assent|Royal Assent]] from Autumn/Winter 2018.  The new guidance body will be accountable to Parliament, with responsibility for coordinating the provision of debt advice, money guidance, and pension guidance, ensuring that people across the UK are able to seek the help and advice they need to manage their finances.

The Bill entered the [[House of Lords]] for its first reading on 22 June 2017 and moved to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] for its first reading on 22 November 2017.

The [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/queens-speech-2017-background-briefing-notes Queen's Speech of June 2017] announced that the new single body would be funded through existing levies on pension schemes and the financial services industry.

The '''National Romantic style''' was a [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] architectural style that was part of the [[Romantic nationalism|National Romantic movement]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is often considered to be a form of [[Art Nouveau]].

==History==
The National Romantic style spread across [[Finland]]; the Scandinavian countries of [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]]; the Baltic countries of [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]], as well as [[Russia]] (mainly [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]). Unlike much nostalgic [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival style]] architecture elsewhere, National Romantic architecture expressed progressive social and political ideals, through reformed domestic architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Miller Lane, ''National Romanticism and Modern Architecture in Germany and the Scandinavian Countries'' (New York: Cambridge University Press), 2000:10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Designers turned to early [[medieval architecture]] and even prehistoric precedents to construct a style appropriate to the perceived character of a people. The style can be seen as a reaction to industrialism and an expression of the same "Dream of the North" nationalism that gave impetus to renewed interest in the [[edda]]s and [[saga]]s.

== Examples==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8894">'''Nutrient density''' identifies the proportion of [[nutrients]] in foods, with terms such as '''nutrient rich''' and  '''micronutrient dense''' referring to similar properties. Several different national and international standards have been developed and are in use (see [[Nutritional rating systems]]).

==Definition and usage==
According to the [[World Health Organization]], [[nutrient profiling]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/profiling/WHO_IASO_report2010/en/ Nutrient Profiling: Report of a WHO/IASO Technical Meeting, London, United Kingdom, 4-6 October 2010, accessed 10/15/2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; classifies and/or ranks foods by their nutritional composition in order to promote human (and/or animal) health and to prevent disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/profiling/en/ Nutrient Profiling, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ranking by nutrient density is one such nutrient profiling strategy.  Ordering foods by nutrient density is a statistical method of comparing foods by the proportion of nutrients in foods.  Some such comparisons can be the [[glycemic index]] and the [[Overall Nutritional Quality Index]].

Nutrient-dense foods such as [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s are the opposite of [[energy density|energy-dense]] food (also called "[[empty calorie]]" food), such as [[alcohol]] and foods high in added [[sugar]] or processed [[cereals]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/food/nutrition/nutrition/dietary_guide/hgic4062.html Hunter, J. G., Cason, K. L., Nutrient Density, Clemson University, 2006(November), accessed 10/15/2014.  Nutrient density is defined as "a measure of the nutrients provided per calorie of food, or the ratio of nutrients to calories (energy)."]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B758G-4HP5YFV-D/2/c86659719922a2736490366333062119 Darmon, N., Darmon, M., Maillot, M., Drewnowski, A., ''A Nutrient Density Standard for Vegetables and Fruits: Nutrients per Calorie and Nutrients per Unit Cost'', Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 105(12),2005 (December), 1881–1887, DOI: 10.1016/j.jada.2005.09.005, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond its use to distinguish different ''types'' of food from each other, nutrient density allows comparison to be made for different examples or samples of the same kind of food. Nutrient density is correlated with soil quality and mineralization levels of the soil, although the relationship is complex and incorporates other dimensions.

The [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] reported in 2013 that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Several indicators of nutrient quality have been summarized by the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Drewnowski, A., Defining nutrient density: Development and validation of the nutrient rich foods index. J Am Coll Nutr. 2009; 28(suppl 4):421S-426S.&lt;/ref&gt;

First published February 24, 2010, doi: 10.3945/ajcn.2010.28450D]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nutrient Rich Food Index has been developed by a research coalition involving food and nutrition practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Trichterborn J, Harzer G, Kunz C. Nutrient profiling and food label claims: Evaluation of dairy products in three major European countries. Eur J Clin Nutr. 2011;65(9): 1032-1038.&lt;/ref&gt;  This index uses nutrient profiles that have been validated against accepted measures of a healthy diet, such as the Healthy Eating Index created by the USDA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andjrnl.org/article/S2212-2672(12)01993-4/pdf Position Paper, Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 2013(February), 113(2), 307-317.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==International standards==

The Nutrient Profiling Scoring Calculator (NPSC) in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] is a calculator for determining whether health claims can be made for a food by its reference to the Nutrient Profiling Scoring Criterion (NPSC).  It is defined by the FSANZ Board, which operates under the FSANZ Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/industry/labelling/pages/nutrientprofilingcalculator/Default.aspx FSANZ Board, Nutrient Profiling Scoring Calculator, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom Ofcom nutrient profiling model provides "a single score for any given food product, based on calculating the number of points for ‘negative’ nutrients which can be offset by points for ‘positive’ nutrients."  A 2007 UK-commissioned review of nutrient profiling models commissioned by the UK Food Standards Agency identified over 40 different schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publichealth.ox.ac.uk/bhfhprg/publicationsandreports/acad-publications/bhfcpnppublished/nutrientprofilemodel Rayner, M., Scarborough, P., Lobtein, P., The UK Ofcom Nutrient Profiling Model, October 2009, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] reviews scientific and operational issues related to human nutrition, specifically when developing world populations are impacted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/profiling/WHO_IASO_report2010/en/ World Health Organization, Nutrient profiling: report of a technical meeting, London, United Kingdom, 4-6 October 2010, 20 pages, Publication date: 2011], {{ISBN|978 92 4 150220 7}}, accessed 10/15/2014, downloadable as a PDF from http://www.who.int/entity/nutrition/publications/profiling/WHO_IASO_report2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in the field of study began in the late 1850s and early 1860s, with a shift in interest caused by the discoveries made by [[Jacques Boucher de Crèvecœur de Perthes|Boucher de Perthes]], after [[Joseph Prestwich]], [[Hugh Falconer]], and [[John Evans (archaeologist)|John Evans]] had visited Boucher de Perthes's site in the Somme valley themselves. Two such archaeologists who had been attracted to join archaeological societies by palaeoarchaeology were [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]] and [[Edward Burnett Tylor]]. Evans, Pitt Rivers, and [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] all promoted interest in the field, each an enthusiast and each quickly rising to positions of authority and influence within archaeological circles. In 1868, for example, they together organized, in conjunction with the annual general meeting in [[Norwich]] of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], the Third International Congress of Prehistoric Archaeology.&lt;ref name=Chapman1989&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Towards an Institutional History of Archaeology: British Archaeologists and Allied Interests in the 1860s|author=William Chapman|title=Tracing archaeology's past: the historiography of archaeology|series=Publications in archaeology|editor=Andrew L. Christenson|publisher=SIU Press|year=1989|isbn=9780809315239|pages=156&amp;ndash;158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of paleoarchaeology sites are found in Southern and Eastern Africa. Some of the most productive sites have been those of Hadar, Sterkfontein, Kanapoi, and Olduvai Gorge.&lt;ref name=Paleo2007&gt;{{cite web|title=Paleoanthropology- Hominid Family History|url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Paleoanthropology.html|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that paleoarchaeology deals with such ancient human remains presents some unique difficulties. Often the remains that are found are incomplete. In addition, paleoarchaeologists often deal with remains that lie somewhere between their primate ancestors and modern humans. This can make the analysis of the remains rather difficult. Similar finds can be rare so paleoarchaeologists must rely on the reanalysis of existing fossils.&lt;ref name="Arch?" /&gt;

In addition to the traditional methods of archaeology and physical anthropology,  linguistics, paleogenomics, geography and various fields of environmental studies are used to explore the questions in the field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4166">'''Parallel I/O''', in the context of a [[computer]], means the performance of multiple [[input/output]] operations at the same time, for instance simultaneously outputs to storage devices and display devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hssl.cs.jhu.edu/~randal/419/lectures/L15.ParallelIO.pdf | title=Parallel I/O | publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a fundamental feature of [[operating system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Fall_IO.pdf | title=Introduction to Parallel I/O | publisher=[[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One particular instance is parallel writing of data to disk; when file data is spread across multiple disks, for example in a [[RAID]] array, one can store multiple parts of the data at the same time, thereby achieving higher write speeds than with a single device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cac.cornell.edu/education/training/ParallelMay2012/ParallelIOMay2012.pdf | title=Introduction: The Parallel I/O Stack | publisher=[[Cornell University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/documents/13601/900558/MPI-IO-Final.pdf/eea9d7d3-4b81-471c-b244-41498070e35d | title=Introduction to Parallel I/O | publisher=[[The University of Texas at Austin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

===Scientific computing===
It is used for scientific computing and not for databases. It breaks up support into multiple layers including High level I/O library, Middleware layer and Parallel file system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk//support/44958.aspx | title=Parallel I/O | publisher=Scientific Computing Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel File System manages the single view, maintains logical space and provides access to data files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cs.lbl.gov/news-media/news/2014/a-comprehensive-look-at-high-performance-parallel-i-o/ | title=A Comprehensive Look at High Performance Parallel I/O | publisher=[[Berkeley Lab]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storage===
A single file may be stripped across one or more object storage target, which increases the bandwidth while accessing the file and available disk space.&lt;ref&gt;http://calcul.math.cnrs.fr/Documents/Manifestations/CIRA2011/2011-01_haefele_parallel_IO-workshop_Lyon.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The caches are larger in Parallel I/O and shared through distributed memory systems.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/OLCF-Data-Intro-IO-Gerber-FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://cs.lbl.gov/news-media/news/2014/a-comprehensive-look-at-high-performance-parallel-i-o/ | title=A Comprehensive Look at High Performance Parallel I/O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://hdfgroup.org/wp/2015/04/parallel-io-why-how-and-where-to-hdf5/ | title=Parallel I/O – Why, How, and Where to?| date=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Teng Wang|author2=Kevin Vasko|author3=Zhuo Liu|author4=Hui Chen|author5=Weikuan Yu|title=Enhance parallel input/output with cross-bundle aggregation|journal=The International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications|volume=30|issue=2|pages=241–256|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parenteral nutrition''' ('''PN''') is the feeding of specialist nutritional products to a person [[intravenous]]ly, bypassing the usual process of [[eating]] and [[digestion]]. The products are made by specialist pharmaceutical compounding companies and is considered to be the highest risk pharmaceutical preparation available as the products cannot undergo any form of terminal sterilization. The person receives highly complex nutritional formulae that contain nutrients such as [[glucose]], [[salts]], [[amino acid]]s, [[lipid]]s and added [[vitamin]]s and [[dietary mineral]]s. It is called '''total parenteral nutrition''' ('''TPN''') or '''total nutrient admixture''' ('''TNA''') when no significant nutrition is obtained by other routes, and '''partial parenteral nutrition''' ('''PPN''') when nutrition is also partially [[gastrointestinal tract|enteric]]. It may be called '''peripheral parenteral nutrition''' ('''PPN''') when administered through [[Peripherally inserted central catheter|vein access in a limb]] rather than through a [[central venous catheter|central vein]] as '''central venous nutrition''' ('''CVN''').

==Medical uses==
Total [[wikt:parenteral|parenteral]] nutrition (TPN) is provided when the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] is nonfunctional because of an interruption in its continuity (it is blocked, or has a leak - a [[fistula]]) or because its absorptive capacity is impaired.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kozier, B., &amp; Erb, G., &amp; Berman, A.J., &amp; Burke, K., &amp; Bouchal, S. R., &amp; Hirst, S. P.. (2004). Fundamentals of Nursing: The Nature of Nursing Practice in Canada. Canadian Edition. Prentice Hall Health: Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used for [[coma]]tose patients, although [[feeding tube|enteral feeding]] is usually preferable, and less prone to complications. Parenteral nutrition is used to prevent malnutrition in patients who are unable to obtain adequate nutrients by oral or [[enteral]] routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?ss=15&amp;doc_id=3056&amp;nbr=2282 |title=American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement: parenteral nutrition |access-date=2008-01-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730131405/http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?ss=15&amp;doc_id=3056&amp;nbr=2282 |archive-date=2007-07-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition recommends waiting until hospital day number seven.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Absolute indications for TPN:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Van Gossum A, Cabre E, Hebuterne X, Jeppesen P, Krznaric Z, Messing B, Powell-Tuck J, Staun M, Nightingale J. ESPEN Guidelines on Parenteral Nutrition: Gastroenterology. Clinical Nutrition. 2009; (28):415-427.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Short bowel syndrome
* Small bowel obstruction
* Active gastrointestinal bleeding
* Pseudo-obstruction with complete intolerance to food
* High-output (defined as &gt; 500ml/day) enteric-cutaneous fistulas (unless a feeding tube can be passed distal to the fistula)

===Gastrointestinal disorders===
TPN may be the only feasible option for providing nutrition to patients who do not have a functioning gastrointestinal tract or who have disorders requiring complete bowel rest, including [[bowel obstruction]],&lt;ref name="Merck Manual"&gt;The Merck Manual, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[short bowel syndrome]],&lt;ref name="Merck Manual" /&gt; [[gastroschisis]],&lt;ref name="Merck Manual" /&gt; prolonged [[diarrhea]] regardless of its cause,&lt;ref name="Merck Manual" /&gt; very severe [[Crohn's disease]]&lt;ref name="Merck Manual" /&gt; or [[ulcerative colitis]],&lt;ref name="Merck Manual" /&gt; and certain pediatric GI disorders including congenital GI anomalies and [[necrotizing enterocolitis]].&lt;ref name="Heird"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heird|first=WC|author2=Gomez, MR|title=Total parenteral nutrition in necrotizing enterocolitis.|journal=Clinics in Perinatology|date=June 1994|volume=21|issue=2|pages=389–409|pmid=8070233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In cancer===
The benefit of TPN to [[cancer]] patients is largely debated, and studies to date have generally showed minimal long term benefit.

==Duration==
Short-term PN may be used if a person's digestive system has shut down (for instance by [[peritonitis]]), and they are at a low enough weight to cause concerns about nutrition during an extended hospital stay. Long-term PN is occasionally used to treat people suffering the extended consequences of an accident, surgery, or digestive disorder. PN has extended the life of children born with nonexistent or severely deformed organs.

===Living with TPN===
Approximately 40,000 people use TPN at home in the United States, and because TPN requires anywhere from 10–16 hours to be administered, daily life can be affected.&lt;ref name= "Yaworski"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yaworski|first=J.A.|title=Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.chp.edu/CHP/faq+about+tpn+intestine|publisher=Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although daily lifestyle can be changed, most patients agree that these changes are better than staying at the hospital.&lt;ref name= "Daisy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Living with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) at home|url=http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/medical-conditions/search-for-medical-conditions/costello-syndrome/living-with-total-parenteral-nutrition-tpn-at-home/|publisher=Great Ormund Street Hospital for Children|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many different types of pumps exist to limit the time the patient is “hooked-up”. Usually a backpack pump is used, allowing for mobility. The time required to be connected to the IV is dependent on the situation of each patient; some require once a day, or five days a week.&lt;ref name= "Yaworski" /&gt;

It is important for patients to avoid as much TPN related change as possible in their lifestyles. This allows for the best possible mental health situation; constantly being held down can lead to resentment and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. [[Physical activity]] is also highly encouraged, but patients must avoid contact sports (equipment damage) and swimming (infection). Many [[teens]] find it difficult to live with TPN due to issues regarding [[body image]] and not being able to participate in activities and events.&lt;ref name= "Yaworski" /&gt;

==Complications==
TPN fully bypasses the GI tract and normal methods of nutrient absorption. Possible complications, which may be significant, are listed below. Other than those listed below, other common complications of TPN include hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, hypercapnia, decreased copper and zinc levels, elevated prothrombin time (if associated with liver injury), hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and decreased gastrointestinal motility.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Infection===
TPN requires a chronic IV access for the solution to run through, and the most common complication is infection of this catheter. Infection is a common cause of death in these patients, with a mortality rate of approximately 15% per infection, and death usually results from [[septic shock]].&lt;ref name=Deshpande&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deshpande|first=KS|title=Total parenteral nutrition and infections associated with use of central venous catheters.|journal=American Journal of Critical Care|date=July 2003|volume=12|issue=4|pages=326–7, 380|pmid=12882062|url=http://ajcc.aacnjournals.org/content/12/4/326.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; When using central venous access, the subclavian (or axillary) vein is preferred due to its ease of access and lowest infectious complications compared to the jugular and femoral vein insertions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Blood clots===
Chronic IV access leaves a foreign body in the vascular system, and blood clots on this IV line are common.&lt;ref name=Mollitt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mollitt|first=DL|author2=Golladay ES.|title=Complications of TPN catheter-induced vena caval thrombosis in children less than one year of age|journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery|date=August 1983|volume=18|issue=4|pages=462–7|pmid=6413671|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022346883802012|doi=10.1016/S0022-3468(83)80201-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Death can result from [[pulmonary embolism]] wherein a clot that starts on the IV line breaks off and travels to the lungs, blocking blood flow.&lt;ref name=Mailloux&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mailloux|first=RJ|author2=DeLegge, MH |author3=Kirby, DF |title=Pulmonary embolism as a complication of long-term total parenteral nutrition|journal=JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition|date=Nov–Dec 1993|volume=17|issue=6|pages=578–82|pmid=8301814|doi=10.1177/0148607193017006578}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Periportal hepatosteatosis intermed mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of [[liver lobule|periportal]] [[fatty liver]] as may arise due to '''TPN'''. [[Trichrome stain]].]]

Patients on TPN who have such clots occluding their catheter may receive a [[thrombolytic]] flush to dissolve the clots and prevent further complications.

===Fatty liver and liver failure===
Fatty liver is usually a more long term complication of TPN, though over a long enough course it is fairly common. The pathogenesis is due to using linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid component of soybean oil) as a major source of calories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evaluation of OMEGAVEN 10%® (n-3 EFA Lipid Emulsion) in Home Parenteral Nutrition-associated Liver Disease (MEGANORM)|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01284049|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piper|first=SN|author2=Rohm KD|title=Hepatocellular integrity after parenteral nutrition: comparison of a fish-oil-containing lipid emulsion with an olive-soybean oil-based lipid emulsion|journal=Eur J Anaesthesiol.|date=Dec 2009|pmid=19916246|doi=10.1097/EJA.0b013e32832e08e0|volume=26|issue=12|pages=1076–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; TPN-associated liver disease strikes up to 50% of patients within 5–7 years, correlated with a mortality rate of 2–50%. Onset of this liver disease is the major complication that leads TPN patients to requiring an [[intestine transplantation|intestinal transplant]].&lt;ref name="Garg et al., 2011"&gt;Garg, M. Jones, R. M., Vaughan, R. B., Testro, A. G. (2011). Intestinal transplantation: Current status and future directions. Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, 26, 1221-1228&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lipid emulsion|Intralipid]] ([[Fresenius (company)|Fresenius-Kabi]]), the US standard lipid emulsion for TPN nutrition, contains a 7:1 ratio of n-6/n-3 ratio of [[Polyunsaturated fat|polyunsaturated fatty acids]] (PUFA). By contrast, [[Omegaven]] has a 1:8 ratio and showed promise in multiple clinical studies. Therefore n-3-rich fat may alter the course of parenteral nutrition associated liver disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar Jain|first=Ajay|last2=Teckman|first2=Jeffrey H.|date=2014|title=Newly Identified Mechanisms of Total Parenteral Nutrition Related Liver Injury|url=http://www.hindawi.com/archive/2014/621380/|journal=Advances in Hepatology|language=en|volume=2014|pages=1–7|doi=10.1155/2014/621380|issn=2356-6744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hunger===
Because patients are being fed intravenously, the subject does not physically eat, resulting in intense [[hunger pang]]s (pains). The brain uses signals from the [[mouth]] ([[taste]] and [[Olfaction|smell]]), the [[stomach]]/[[gastrointestinal tract]] (fullness) and [[blood]] ([[nutrient]] levels) to determine conscious feelings of [[Hunger (motivational state)|hunger]].&lt;ref name= "Hunger WIKI"&gt;[[Hunger (motivational state)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In cases of TPN, the taste, smell and physical fullness requirements are not met, and so the patient experiences hunger, despite the fact that the body is being fully nourished.

Patients who eat food despite the inability can experience a wide range of complications.&lt;ref name= "bowel obst"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bowel Obstruction|url=http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/conditions/bowel-obstruction|publisher=Women's Health|accessdate=30 March 2014|date=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cholecystitis ===
Total parenteral nutrition increases the risk of acute [[cholecystitis]]&lt;ref name=Tucker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=RA|title=Acalculous cholecystitis and fever related to total parenteral nutrition|pmid=6437783|year=1984|last2=Jenkins|first2=HL|volume=18|issue=11|pages=897–9|journal=Drug Intelligence &amp; Clinical Pharmacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  due to complete disuse of gastrointestinal tract, which may result in bile stasis in the [[gallbladder]]. Other potential [[hepatobiliary dysfunction]]s include [[steatosis]],&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=H|author2=Khaoustov, VI |author3=Krishnan, B |author4=Cai, W |author5=Stoll, B |author6=Burrin, DG |author7= Yoffe, B |title=Total parenteral nutrition induces liver steatosis and apoptosis in neonatal piglets|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|date=October 2006|volume=136|issue=10|pages=2547–52|pmid=16988124|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/136/10/2547.short|doi=10.1093/jn/136.10.2547}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[steatohepatitis]], [[cholestasis]], and [[cholelithiasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Quigley EM, Marsh MN, Shaffer JL, Markin RS |title=Hepatobiliary complications of total parenteral nutrition |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=104 |issue=1 |pages=286–301 |date=January 1993 |pmid=8419252 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six percent of patients on TPN longer than 3 weeks and 100% of patients on TPN longer than 13 weeks develop [[biliary sludge]].  The formation of sludge is the result of stasis due to lack of enteric stimulation and is not due to changes in bile composition. Gallbladder sludge disappears after 4 weeks of normal oral diet.  Administration of exogenous [[cholecystokinin|cholecystokinin (CCK)]] or stimulation of endogenous CCK by periodic pulse of large amounts of amino acids have been shown to help prevent sludge formation. These therapies are not routinely recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcm.edu/gastro/VGICC/GI-M0054/09-DISC.HTM |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910002340/http://www.bcm.edu/gastro/VGICC/GI-M0054/09-DISC.HTM |archivedate=2006-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such complications are suggested to be the main reason for mortality in people requiring long-term total parenteral nutrition, such as in [[short bowel syndrome]].&lt;ref name=Vanderhoof&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vanderhoof JA, Langnas AN |title=Short-bowel syndrome in children and adults |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=113 |issue=5 |pages=1767–78 |year=1997 |pmid=9352883 |doi=10.1053/gast.1997.v113.pm9352883}}&lt;/ref&gt; In newborn infants with short bowel syndrome with less than 10% of expected intestinal length, thereby being dependent upon total parenteral nutrition, 5 year survival is approximately 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Spencer AU, Neaga A, West B, etal |title=Pediatric short bowel syndrome: redefining predictors of success |journal=Ann.

=== Other complications ===
Other complications are either related to catheter insertion, or metabolic, including [[refeeding syndrome]]. Catheter complications include [[pneumothorax]], accidental arterial puncture, and catheter-related sepsis.

=== Pregnancy ===
[[Pregnancy]] can cause major complications when trying to properly dose the nutrient mixture. Because all of the baby’s nourishment comes from the mother’s blood stream, the doctor must properly calculate the dosage of nutrients to meet both recipients’ needs and have them in usable forms. Incorrect dosage can lead to many adverse, hard-to-guess effects, such as [[death]], and varying degrees of [[deformity|deformation]] or other [[Intellectual disability|developmental problems]].&lt;ref name= "Landon"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landon|first1=MB|last2=Gabbe|first2=SG|last3=Mullen|first3=JL|title=Total parenteral nutrition during pregnancy.|journal=Clin Perinatol|year=1986|volume=13|issue=1|pages=57–72|pmid=3082563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is recommended that parenteral nutrition administration begin after a period of natural nutrition so doctors can properly calculate the nutritional needs of the [[fetus]]. Otherwise, it should only be administered by a team of highly skilled doctors who can accurately assess the fetus’ needs.&lt;ref name= "Landon" /&gt;

==Total parenteral nutrition==
[[File:LipidHPN.jpg|thumb|right | Prescription lipid parenteral nutrition formulation]]
Solutions for total parenteral nutrition may be customized to individual patient requirements, or standardized solutions may be used. The use of standardized parenteral nutrition solutions is cost effective and may provide better control of serum electrolytes.&lt;ref name=Hayes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayes|first=EM|author2=Cohen KR|author3=Pinard BE|author4=Lauletta J|author5=Ruggiero R.|title=Standardized versusindividually customized parenteral nutrition solutions: a comparison ofserum electrolyte values|journal=P&amp;T|year=2000|volume=25|issue=2|pages=78–80, 83, 87|url=http://www.ptcommunity.com/ptjournal/fulltext/25/2/2502078.pdf|access-date=2010-09-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715130250/http://www.ptcommunity.com/ptjournal/fulltext/25/2/2502078.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ideally each patient is assessed individually before commencing on parenteral nutrition, and a team consisting of specialised doctors, nurses, [[clinical pharmacist]]s and [[Registered Dietitian|registered dietitian]]s evaluate the patient's individual data and decide what PN formula to use and at what infusion rate.

For energy only, [[intravenous sugar solution]]s with [[dextrose]] or [[glucose]] are generally used. This is not considered to be parenteral nutrition as it does not prevent malnutrition when used on its own. Standardized solutions may also differ between developers. Following are some examples of what compositions they may have. The solution for normal patients may be given both centrally and peripherally.

==Components==

===Prepared solutions===
Prepared solutions generally consist of [[water]] and electrolytes; [[glucose]], [[amino acid]]s, and lipids; essential [[vitamin]]s, minerals and trace elements are added or given separately. Previously lipid emulsions were given separately but it is becoming more common for a "three-in-one" solution of glucose, proteins, and lipids to be administered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Didier ME, Fischer S, Maki DG |title=Total nutrient admixtures appear safer than lipid emulsion alone as regards microbial contamination: growth properties of microbial pathogens at room temperature |journal=JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=291–6 |year=1998 |pmid=9739032
|doi=10.1177/0148607198022005291 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rollins CJ, Elsberry VA, Pollack KA, Pollack PF, Udall JN |title=Three-in-one parenteral nutrition: a safe and economical method of nutritional support for infants |journal=JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=290–4 |year=1990 |pmid=2112645 |doi=10.1177/0148607190014003290 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Added components===
Individual nutrient components may be added to more precisely adjust the body contents of it. That individual nutrient may, if possible, be infused individually, or it may be injected into a bag of nutrient solution or intravenous fluids ([[volume expander]] solution) that is given to the patient.

Administration of individual components may be more hazardous than administration of pre-mixed solutions such as those used in total parenteral nutrition, because the latter are generally already balanced in regard to e.g. osmolarity and ability to infuse peripherally. Incorrect IV administration of concentrated [[Potassium#In diet|potassium]] can be lethal, but this is not a danger if the potassium is mixed in TPN solution and diluted.&lt;ref name=RNSH&gt;[http://www.ciap.health.nsw.gov.au/nswtag/publications/guidelines/Postassium/RNSHRyde.pdf Intravenous Potassium Guidelines (ADULTS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224050743/http://www.ciap.health.nsw.gov.au/nswtag/publications/guidelines/Postassium/RNSHRyde.pdf |date=2011-02-24 }} From RNSH Pharmacy Department. Authorised by: Margaret Duguid. Last Modified: June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitamins may be added to a bulk premixed nutrient immediately before administration, since the additional vitamins can promote spoilage of stored product.{{citation needed | reason= need studies that how stability with and without added vitamins |date=January 2016}} Vitamins can be added in two doses, one fat-soluble, the other water-soluble. {{anchor|Cernevit}}There are also single-dose preparations with both fat- and water-soluble vitamins such as ''Cernevit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/1999/20924lbl.pdf|title=Cernevit™-12 (multivitamins for infusion)|website=[[Food and Drug Administration]]|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[NPS MedicineWise]]|url=http://www.nps.org.au/__data/cmi_pdfs/CMR03211.pdf|title=Cernevit|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|minerals}}Minerals and trace elements for parenteral nutrition are available in prepared mixtures, such as ''Addaven''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugbase.de//de/datenbanken/abda-datenbank/aktuelle-infos/artikel.html?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=2174555&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=115&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bback_link%5D=yes&amp;cHash=e7f22d012a12142d6cab1215df22b24f|title=Addaven Konzentrat zur Herstellung einer Infusionslösung|publisher=Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft Stuttgart|date=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emulsifier===
Only a limited number of emulsifiers are commonly regarded as safe to use for parenteral administration, of which the most important is [[lecithin]].{{medcn|date=May 2013}} Lecithin can be biodegraded and metabolized, since it is an integral part of biological membranes, making it virtually non-toxic. Other emulsifiers can only be excreted via the kidneys,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} creating a toxic load. The emulsifier of choice for most fat emulsions used for parenteral nutrition is a highly purified egg lecithin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.chemie.uni-erlangen.de/services/dissonline/data/dissertation/Christoph_Wabel/html/Chapter1.html Lecithin - An Emulsifier for Parenteral Use: TORVS Research Team]&lt;/ref&gt; due to its low toxicity and complete integration with cell membranes.

Use of egg-derived emulsifiers is not recommended for people with an egg allergy due to the risk of reaction. In situations where there is no suitable emulsifying agent for a person at risk of developing essential fatty acid deficiency, cooking oils may be spread upon large portions of available skin for supplementation by transdermal absorption.

Another type of fat emulsion [[Omegaven]] is being used experimentally within the US primarily in the pediatric population. It is made of fish oil instead of the egg based formulas more widely in use. Research has shown use of Omegaven may reverse and prevent liver disease and cholestasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21448206 | doi=10.1038/jp.2010.182 | volume=31 Suppl 1 | title=The use of Omegaven in treating parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease | year=2011 | journal=J Perinatol | pages=S57–60| last1=Park | first1=K.

A '''planned unit development (PUD)''' is a type of building development and also a regulatory process. As a building development, it is a designed grouping of both varied and compatible [[land use]]s, such as [[house|housing]], [[recreation]], [[commerce|commercial]] centers, and [[industrial park]]s, all within one contained development or [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]].

==History==
The origins of PUDs in the new American communities can be traced to British movements during the 1950s. The developments in Britain's new communities dealt with the locations of [[industry|industrial]] elements and how they were publicly dictated before building ever began in order to uphold an [[economic base]]. However, in America, privately controlled communities often had to attract industry after the residential sectors had been built and occupied.

The oldest forms of the planned unit development in America appeared shortly after World War II in the [[Levittown]]s and [[Park Forest, Illinois|Park Forest]] developments, as whole communities within the limits and orbits of large metropolitan centers. The first zoning evidence of PUD was created by [[Prince George's County, Maryland]] in 1949. It "permit[ed] the development of a large tract of land as a complete neighborhood unit, having a range of dwelling types, the necessary local shopping facilities and off-street parking areas, parks, playgrounds, school sites, and other community facilities" (Burchell 43). Alexandria, Virginia, in 1952, as an amendment to its city code, provided for a "Community Unit Plan", with the intent to provide for planned community facilities and [[Urban open space|open space]] development with new residential building.  One of the first modern uses of the term "planned unit development" appears in San Francisco's code of ordinances in 1962.

==Current definitions==
PUD as a regulatory process is a means of land regulation which promotes large scale, unified land development by means of mid-range, realistic programs in chase of physically curable, social and economic deficiencies in land and cityscapes. Where appropriate, this development control promotes: 
*A mixture of both land uses and dwelling types with at least one of the land uses being regional in nature
*The clustering of residential land uses providing public and common open space
*Increased administrative discretion to a local professional planning staff while setting aside present land use regulations and rigid plat approval processes
*The enhancement of the bargaining process between the developer and government municipalities which in turn strengthens the municipality's site plan review and control over development for potentially increased profits due to land efficiency, multiple land uses, and increased residential densities.

Frequently, PUDs take on a variety of forms ranging from small clusters of houses combined with open spaces to new and developing towns with thousands of residents and various land uses. However, the definition of a PUD does not take into consideration these types of developments unless they fit into a category of size ranging from {{convert|100|to|200|acre}}. In a PUD the property owner owns the land the dwelling sits on.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Mixtures of land uses==
In PUDs, the zoning of districts becomes very different from what was standard under the [[Standard State Zoning Enabling Act|Standard Zoning Enabling Act]]. Historically, the districts were very narrow in type and large in area. Within PUDs, zoning becomes much more integrated with multiple land uses and districts being placed on adjacent land parcels.

Residential properties in PUDs are by far the most numerous and occupy the largest land areas. PUDs tend to incorporate single-family residential uses in proximity to two-family units and multiple-family dwellings to form a larger diversified neighborhood concept. Schools, churches, retirement homes, hospitals, and recreation facilities begin to find their way into residential districts. Residential districts also tend to use the best land in the community and the most favorable sites are protected from commercial and industrial uses.

Grouping shopping districts by service area is a first step in returning to the neighborhood concept. Land is reserved for regional, community, and local shopping clusters with some specific restrictions based on market experience and on what types of business intend to locate at each development. Local shopping districts with sufficient provisions for off-street parking, height restrictions, and traffic control are not frequently found surrounded by residential areas.

Industrial standards now help to reduce the journey for employees to work. Nowadays, there tends to be environmental and performance regulations that cut back on the amount of nuisance to surrounding areas adjacent to industrial districts. With sufficient setbacks, off-street parking, and height regulations, industrial locations adjacent to residential zones are usually looked to as an overall community goal. PUDs do not normally have large numbers of industrial districts, but if so, they tend to be geared more towards light industry.

A '''planned residential unit development (PRUD)''' (sometimes '''planned unit residential development (PURD))''' is a variant form of PUD where common areas are owned by the individual homeowners and not a [[homeowners association]] or other entity.  A PURD is considered the same as a PUD for planning commission purposes and allows for flexibility in zoning and civic planning.

=== Maintenance of common areas ===
In most PUDs, individual owners have full ownership of their homes and buildings, making them the responsible party for maintenance. Governing documents of homeowners associations within PUDs often delegate most of the maintenance responsibilities to the owners, assuming the least amount of responsibility possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HOA Maintenance Responsibility in Condominiums and Planned Unit Developments|url=http://www.echo-ca.org/article/hoa-maintenance-responsibility-condominiums-and-planned-unit-developments |publisher=ECHO|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design principles==

===Houses and placement of houses===
Houses in PUDs often include access to a large shared open space surrounding the house as well as a smaller private yard. These large protected open spaces are created by the layout of the buildings and are intended for use by all residents of the developments. Different housing types ([[Single-family detached home|single-family]], [[two-family]], [[multiple-family]]) are often mixed rather than separated as is done in conventional development

===Streets===
[[Street pattern]]s are one of the most important elements in establishing the neighborhood character of a residential community. Most non-PUD development focuses on obtaining maximum [[frontage]] for lot sizes and maximum flow of traffic on all streets. However, in order to dispel the monotony of the typical [[grid plan]] street pattern, PUDs often employ a [[street hierarchy|hierarchy of street types]] based on usage. Local streets serve only residences and have a low traffic volume, while collector streets connect [[local street]]s to arterials, which are the major routes of travel throughout a PUD.

===Sidewalks and pedestrian ways===
Sidewalks and pedestrian ways of PUDs supplement and complement street systems in establishing the character of the neighborhood. Sidewalks are located on at least one side of every street to enable the [[walkability]] of the developments. Circulation systems are provided to link residential groupings, open space areas, schools, and local shopping areas.

===Combining design features===
It is in the ability to design each of these components simultaneously that makes PUDs unique and effective. Each of the elements work together to enhance the whole. This represents a major advantage over traditional zoning practices that force lots to be planned in accordance with broad rules that may allow for some incompatibility.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36536">'''Plaçage''' was a recognized extralegal system in French and Spanish slave colonies of North America (including the Caribbean) by which ethnic European men entered into civil unions with [[person of color|non-Europeans]] of African, Native American and mixed-race descent. The term comes from the French ''placer'' meaning "to place with". The women were not legally recognized as wives but were known as ''placées''; their relationships were recognized among the [[free people of color]] as ''mariages de la main gauche'' or [[Morganatic marriage|left-handed marriages]]. They became institutionalized with contracts or negotiations that settled property on the woman and her children, and in some cases gave them freedom if enslaved. The system flourished throughout the [[Louisiana (New France)|French]] and [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish colonial]] periods, reaching its zenith during the latter, between 1769 and 1803.

It was widely practiced in New Orleans, where planter society had created enough wealth to support the system. It also took place in the Latin-influenced cities of [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] and [[Biloxi, Mississippi]]; [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]]; [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] and [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Florida]];&lt;ref&gt;''Chained to the Rock of Adversity, To Be Free, Black &amp; Female in the Old South,'' edited by Virginia Meacham Gould, University of Georgia Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Saint-Domingue]] (now the Republic of [[Haiti]]). Plaçage became associated with [[New Orleans]] as part of its cosmopolitan society.

In recent years, at least three historians (''viz.'' Kenneth Aslakson, Emily Clark, and Carol Schlueter) have challenged the [[historicity]] of plaçage and have referred to many of its features, including quadroon balls, as "a myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mixedracestudies.org/wordpress/?tag=quadroon-balls|title=Mixed Race Studies   » quadroon balls|website=www.mixedracestudies.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/stacy-parker-aab/quadroons-for-beginners-d_b_3869605.html|title=Quadroons for Beginners: Discussing the Suppressed and Sexualized History of Free Women of Color with Author Emily Clark|first=Stacy Parker Le|last=Melle|date=4 September 2013|website=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development of the plaçage system==
The plaçage system developed from the predominance of men among early colonial populations, who took women as consorts from Native Americans, current free women of color that came to America from places such as Saint-Domingue and some enslaved Africans. Adding to what was known as free people of color in Louisiana, and especially New Orleans, during the colonial years, from whom wealthy men would choose. In this period there was a shortage of European women, as the colonies were dominated in the early day by male explorers and colonists. Given the harsh conditions in Louisiana, persuading women to follow the men was not easy. France recruited willing farm- and city-dwelling women, known as casket or ''[[casquette girl]]s'', because they brought all their possessions to the colonies in a small trunk or casket. France also sent women convicted along with their debtor husbands, and in 1719, deported 209 women felons "who were of a character to be sent to the French settlement in Louisiana."&lt;ref name=Morlas&gt;Katy F. Morlas, "La Madame et la Mademoiselle," graduate thesis in history, Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; (France also relocated young women orphans known as [[King's Daughters]] ({{lang-fr|filles du roi}}) to their colonies for marriage: to both Canada and Louisiana.)

[[Image:departcassettegirls.jpg|left|thumbnail|A print by Dupin after [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]] depicting "comfort women" embarking unwillingly for the Americas. Whether "comfort women", "casket girls", or aristocrats, French women were reluctant to migrate to the French colonies.]]
Historian Joan Martin maintains that there is little documentation that "casket girls", considered among the ancestors of white French Creoles, were brought to Louisiana. The [[Ursulines|Ursuline order of nuns]] supposedly chaperoned the casket girls until they married, but the order has denied they followed this practice. Martin suggests this was a myth, and that interracial relationships occurred from the beginning of the encounter among Europeans, Native Americans and Africans. She also writes that some Creole families who today identify as white had ancestors during the colonial period who were African or [[multiracial]], and whose descendants married white over generations.&lt;ref&gt;Joan M. Martin, ''Placage and the Louisiana Gens de Couleur Libre'', in [[Creole language|Creole]], edited by Sybil Kein, Louisiana State University Press, Baton Rouge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through warfare and raids, Native American women were often captured to be traded, sold, or taken as wives. At first, the colony generally imported African men to use as slave labor because of the heavy work of clearing to develop plantations. Over time, it also imported African women as slaves. Marriage between the races was forbidden according to the [[Code Noir]] of the eighteenth century, but interracial sex continued. The upper class [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] men during this period often did not marry until their late twenties or early thirties. [[Premarital sex]] with an intended white bride, especially if she was of high rank, was not permitted socially.

===Free people of color===
White male colonists, often the younger sons of noblemen, military men, and planters, who needed to accumulate some wealth before they could marry, took women of color as consorts before marriage or in some cases after their first wives died. Merchants and administrators also followed this practice if they were wealthy enough. When the women bore children, they were sometimes emancipated along with their children. Both the woman and her children might take the surnames of the man. When Creole men reached an age when they were expected to marry, some also kept their relationships with their placées, but this was less common. A wealthy white man could have two (or more) families: one legal, and the other not. Their mixed-race children became the nucleus of the class of [[free people of color]] or ''[[gens de couleur|gens de couleur libres]]'' in Louisiana and Saint-Domingue. After the [[Haitian Revolution]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, many refugees came to New Orleans, adding a new wave of French-speaking free people of color.

During the period of French and Spanish rule, the ''gens de couleur'' came to constitute a third class in New Orleans and other former French cities - between the white Creoles and the mass of black slaves. They had certain status and rights, and often acquired education and property. Later their descendants became leaders in New Orleans, holding political office in the city and state, and becoming part of what developed as the [[African-American middle class]] in the [[United States]].

By 1788, 1500 Creole women of color and black women were being maintained by white men.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Guillory, "Under One Roof: The Sins and Sanctity of the New Orleans Quadroon Balls", in ''Race Consciousness'', edited by Judith Jackson Fossett and Jeffrey A. Tucker, New York University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain customs had evolved. It was common for a wealthy, married Creole to live primarily outside New Orleans on his [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] with his white family. He often kept a second address in the city to use for entertaining and socializing among the white elite. He had built or bought a house for his placée and their children. She and her children were part of the society of Creoles of color. The white world might not recognize the placée as a wife legally and socially, but she was recognized as such among the Creoles of color. Some of the women acquired [[slavery|slaves]] and plantations. Particularly during the Spanish colonial era, a woman might be listed as owning slaves; these were sometimes relatives whom she intended to free after earning enough money to buy their freedom.

While in New Orleans (or other cities), the man would cohabit with the placée as an official "boarder" at her Creole cottage or house. Many were located near [[Rampart Street]] in New Orleans-—once the demarcation line or wall between the city and the frontier. Other popular neighborhoods for Creoles of color were the [[Faubourg Marigny]] and [[Tremé]]. If the man was not married, he might keep a separate residence, preferably next door or in the same or next block as his placée. He often took part in and arranged for the upbringing and education of their children. For a time both boys and girls were educated in France, as there were no schools in New Orleans for mixed-race children. As supporting such a plaçage arrangement(s) ran into thousands of dollars per year, it was limited to the wealthy.

===Inheritance and work===
Upon the death of her protector, the placée and her family could, on legal challenge, expect up to a third of the man's property. Some white lovers tried, and succeeded, in making their mixed-race children primary heirs over other white descendants or relatives. A notable inheritance case was the daughters of [[Nicolás María Vidal]], a former high official in Spanish Louisiana, who with their mother, Eufrosina Hisnard, successfully petitioned the U.S. government in the 1830s to intercede on their behalf to secure a portion of Vidal's estate.&lt;ref name="Congress1834"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States Congress|title=American State Papers: Documents, Legislative and Executive, of the Congress of the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MhVFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA868|year=1834|publisher=Gales and Seaton|location=Washington, D.C.|chapter=Transactions in the Floridas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ClintonGillespie1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clinton|first1=Catherine|last2=Gillespie|first2=Michele|title=The Devil's Lane: Sex and Race in the Early South|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37q5j7Ix-fkC&amp;pg=PA239|accessdate=17 October 2018|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-19-802721-8|pages=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women in these relationships often worked to develop assets: acquiring property, running a legitimate rooming-house, or a small business as a hairdresser, [[marchande]] (female street or country merchant/vendor), or a seamstress. She could also become a placée to another white Creole. She sometimes taught her daughters to become placées, by education and informal schooling in dress, comportment, and ways to behave. A mother negotiated with a young man for the dowry or property settlement, sometimes by contract, for her daughter if a white Creole were interested in her. A former placée could also marry or cohabit with a Creole man of color and have more children.

Contrary to popular misconceptions, placées were not and did not become prostitutes. Creole men of color objected to the practice as denigrating the virtue of Creole women of color, but some, as descendants of white males, benefited by the transfer of social capital. Martin writes, "They did not choose to live in concubinage; what they chose was to survive."{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, after Reconstruction and with the reassertion of white supremacy across the former Confederacy, the white Creole historians, [[Charles Gayarré]] and [[Alcée Fortier]], wrote histories that did not address plaçage in much detail. They suggested that little race mixing had occurred during the colonial period, and that the placées had seduced or led white Creole men astray. They wrote that the French Creoles (in the sense of having long been native to Louisiana) were ethnic Europeans who were threatened by the spectre of race-mixing like other Southern whites.

Gayarré, when younger, was said to have taken a woman of color as his placée and she had their children, to his later shame. He married a white woman late in life. His earlier experience inspired his novel ''Fernando de Lemos''.

==Notable placées==

===Marie Thérèse Metoyer===
[[Marie Thérèse Metoyer]] ''dite'' [[Coincoin]] became an icon of black female entrepreneurship in colonial Louisiana. She was born at the frontier outpost of [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]] on [[Cane River]] in August 1742 as a slave of the post founder, the controversial explorer [[Louis Juchereau de St. Denis]]. She would be, for twenty years, the placée of a French colonial merchant-turned-planter, [[Claude Thomas Pierre Métoyer]] two years her junior. At the onset of their plaçage, she was already the mother of five children; she would bear ten more to Métoyer. In 1778, he freed her after the parish priest filed charges against Coincoin as a "public concubine" and threatened to have her sold at New Orleans if they did not end their relationship. As a free woman, she remained with Métoyer until 1788, when his growing fortune persuaded him to take a wife who could provide legal heirs. (He chose another Marie Thérèse, a white Créole of French and German birth.)

In setting Coincoin aside, Métoyer donated to her his interest in 80 [[arpent]]s, about {{convert|68|acre|m2}} of unpatented land, adjacent to his plantation, to help support their free-born offspring. On that modest tract, Coincoin planted tobacco, a valuable commodity in the struggling colony. She and her children trapped bears and wild turkeys for sales of meat, hide, and oil locally and at the New Orleans market. She also manufactured medicine, a skill shared by her freed-slave sister Marie Louise ''dite'' Mariotte and likely one acquired from their African-born parents. With this money, she progressively bought the freedom of four of her first five children and several grandchildren, before investing in three African-born slaves to provide the physical labor that became more difficult as she aged. After securing a colonial patent on her homestead in 1794, she petitioned for and was given a land concession from the Spanish crown. On that piney-woods tract of 800 arpents (667 ac) on Old Red River, about 5&amp;nbsp;mi from her farmstead, she set up a vacherie (a ranch) and engaged a Spaniard to tend her cattle. Shortly before her death in 1816, Coincoin sold her homestead and divided her remaining property (her piney-woods land, the three African slaves, and their offspring) among her own progeny.

As often happened among the children of plaçages, Coincoin's one surviving daughter by Métoyer, Marie Susanne, became a placée also. As a young woman, apparently with the blessing of both parents, she entered into a relationship with a newly arrived physician, Joseph Conant from New Orleans. When he left Cane River, soon after the birth of their son, she formed a second and lifelong plaçage with a Cane River planter, Jean Baptiste Anty. As a second-generation entrepreneur, Susanne became far more successful than her mother and died in 1838 leaving an estate of $61,600 (equivalent to $1,500,000 in 2009 currency).

Modern archaeological work at the site of Coincoin's farmstead is documenting some of the aspects of her domestic life. A mid-nineteenth century dwelling, now dubbed the Coincoin-Prudhomme House although it was not the actual site of her residence, commemorates her within the Cane River National Heritage Area. Popular lore also has, erroneously, credited her with the ownership of a Cane River plantation founded by her son Louis Metoyer, known today as [[Melrose Plantation]], and its historic buildings Yucca House and [[African House]]. Her eldest half-French son, [[Nicolas Augustin Métoyer]], founded [[St. Augustine Parish (Isle Brevelle) Church]], the spiritual center of Cane River's large community of Creoles of color who trace their heritage to Coincoin.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Elizabeth Shown.

===Eulalie de Mandéville===

There were many other examples of white Creole fathers who reared and carefully and quietly placed their daughters of color with the sons of known friends or family members. This occurred with [[Eulalie de Mandéville]], the elder half-sister of color to the eccentric nobleman, politician, and land developer [[Bernard de Marigny|Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandéville]]. Taken from her slave mother as a baby, and partly raised by a white grandmother, 22-year-old Eulalie was "placed" by her father, [[Count Pierre Enguerrand Philippe, Écuyer de Mandéville, Sieur de Marigny]], with [[Eugène de Macarty]], a member of the famous [[French people|French]]-[[Irish people|Irish]] clan in 1796. Their alliance resulted in five children and lasted almost fifty years.&lt;ref name=Morlas/&gt;

[[Image:BernardMarignyPortrait.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Portrait of Bernard de Marigny, flamboyant Creole millionaire and the half-brother of Eulalie de Mandéville de Macarty.]]
Macarty, like some white Creoles, never married a white woman.

[[Image:AugustinDeMacarty.jpg|right|thumb|Portrait of Augustin de Macarty, military man, mayor of New Orleans, and brother of Eugène de Macarty.]]
In contrast to the Macartys' stable relationship, Eugène's brother [[Augustin de Macarty]] was married and was said to have had numerous, complex affairs with Creole women of color. When he died, several women made claims on behalf of their children against his estate.&lt;ref&gt;Violet Harrington Bryan, "Marcus Christian's Treatment of Les Gens de Couleur Libre", in Creole, edited by Sybil Kein, Louisiana State University Press, Baton Rouge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his deathbed in 1845, Eugène de Macarty married Eulalie. He willed her all of his money and property, then worth $12,000. His white relatives, including his niece, [[Madame LaLaurie|Marie Delphine de Macarty LaLaurie]], contested the will. The court upheld his will. After Eulalie's death, their surviving children defeated another attempt by Macarty's relatives to claim his estate, by then worth more than $150,000. Eulalie de Mandéville de Macarty became a successful [[marchande]] and ran a dairy. She died in 1848.

===Rosette Rochon===
&lt;span id="RosetteRochon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:rosetterochon.gif|right|thumbnail|Sketch of Rosette Rochon: banker, speculator, entrepreneur, and placée.]] --&gt;

[[Rosette Rochon]] was born in 1767 in colonial [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], the daughter of Pierre Rochon, a shipbuilder from a Québécois family (family name was Rocheron in [[Québec]]), and his mulâtresse slave-consort Marianne, who bore him five other children. Once Rosette reached a suitable age, she became the consort of a Monsieur Hardy, with whom she relocated to the colony of [[Saint Domingue]]. During her sojourn there, Hardy must have died or relinquished his relationship with her; for in 1797 during the Haitian Revolution, she escaped to New Orleans, where she later became the placée of Joseph Forstal and Charles Populus, both wealthy white New Orleans Creoles.

Rochon came to speculate in real estate in the [[French Quarter]]; she eventually owned rental property, opened grocery stores, made loans, bought and sold mortgages, and owned and rented out (hired out) slaves. She also traveled extensively back and forth to [[Haiti]], where her son by Hardy had become a government official in the new republic. Her social circle in New Orleans once included [[Marie Laveau]], [[Jean Lafitte]], and the free black contractors and real estate developers [[Jean-Louis Doliolle]] and his brother [[Joseph Doliolle]].

In particular, Rochon became one of the earliest investors in the [[Faubourg Marigny]], acquiring her first lot from [[Bernard de Marigny]] in 1806. Bernard de Marigny, the Creole speculator, refused to sell the lots he was subdividing from his family plantation to anyone who spoke English. While this turned out to be a losing financial decision, Marigny felt more comfortable with the French-speaking, Catholic free people of color (having relatives, lovers, and even children on this side of the color line). Consequently, much of Faubourg Marigny was built by free black artisans for free people of color or for French-speaking white Creoles. Rochon remained largely illiterate, dying in 1863 at the age of 96, leaving behind an [[Estate (law)|estate]] valued at $100,000 (today, an estate worth a million dollars).

===Marie Laveau===
[[Marie Laveau]] (also spelled Leveau, Laveaux), known as the [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] queen of New Orleans, was born between 1795 and 1801 as the daughter of a white Haitian plantation owner, Charles Leveaux, and his mixed black and Indian placée Marguerite Darcantel (or D'Arcantel). Because there were so many whites as well as free people of color in [[Haiti]] with the same names, Leveaux could also have been a free man of color who owned slaves and property as well. All three may have escaped Haiti along with thousands of other Creole whites and Creoles of color during the slave uprisings that culminated in the French colony's becoming the only independent black republic in the New World.

At 17, Marie married a Creole man of color popularly known as [[Jacques Paris]] (however, in some documents, he is known as [[Santiago Paris]]). Paris either died, disappeared or deliberately abandoned her (some accounts also relate that he was a merchant seaman or sailor in the navy) after she produced a daughter. Laveau was styling herself as the Widow Paris and was a hairdresser for white matrons (she was also reckoned to be an herbalist and [[yellow fever]] nurse) when she met [[Louis-Christophe Dumesnil de Glapion]] and in the early 1820s, they became lovers.

Marie was just beginning her spectacular career as a [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] practitioner (she would not be declared a "queen" until about 1830), and Dumesnil de Glapion was a fiftyish white Creole veteran of the [[Battle of New Orleans]] with relatives on both sides of the color line. Recently,{{vague|date=September 2016}} it has been alleged that Dumesnil de Glapion was so in love with Marie, he refused to live separately from his placée according to racial [[convention (norm)|custom]]. In an unusual decision, Dumesnil de Glapion [[Passing (racial identity)|passed]] as a man of color in order to live with her under respectable circumstances—thus explaining the confusion many historians have had whether he was truly white or black.&lt;ref&gt;Caryn Cosse Bell, "The Real Marie Laveau", review of Voodoo Queen: The Spirited Lives of Marie Laveau, by Martha Ward, University Press of Mississippi, Jackson, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is popularly thought that Marie presented Dumesnil de Glapion with fifteen children, only five are listed in vital statistics and of these, two daughters—one the famous Marie Euchariste or [[Marie Leveau II]]—lived to adulthood. Marie Euchariste closely resembled her mother and startled many who thought that Marie Leveau had been resurrected by the black arts, or could be at two places at once, beliefs that the daughter did little to correct.

Sebastopol: This [[Plantation complexes in the Southeastern United States#Plantation house|plantation house]] and property was built and cultivated by Don Pedro Morin in the 1830s in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. It was bought twenty years later by Colonel Ignatius Szymanski a Polish American who later served in the Confederate Army, and renamed Sebastopol. At his death, Colonel Szymanski willed this estate to his placée Eliza Romain, a free woman of color, and to their son John Szymanski.

==Quadroon balls==
The term [[quadroon]] is a fractional one referring to a person with one white and one mulatto parent, some courts would have considered one-fourth Black. The "quadroon balls" were social events designed to encourage mixed-race women to form liaisons with wealthy white men through a system of concubinage known as plaçage.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Guillory, "Under One Roof: The Sins and Sanctity of the New Orleans Quadroon Balls", 68-9&lt;/ref&gt; Monique Guillory writes about quadroon balls that took place in New Orleans, the city most strongly associated with these events. She approaches the balls in context of the history of a building the structure of which is now the Bourbon Orleans Hotel. Inside is the Orleans Ballroom, a legendary, if not entirely factual, location for the earliest quadroon balls.

[[File:SignaresBal.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a [[signare]] ball in colonial [[Saint-Louis, Senegal]].]]

The origin of quadroon balls can be traced to the ''[[redoutes des filles de couleur]]'' in [[Cap-Francais]] in the French colony of [[Saint Domingue]].&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;Jorge Canizares-Esguerra, Matt D. Childs, James Sidbury: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vxx0F6zZUfwC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=redoutes+des+filles+de+couleur+saint+domingue&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NhDck48HCS&amp;sig=MqL4IUUKqWS5Oa7DwwusI4w6suM&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA6Z618LHVAhUSalAKHdYMCT0Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=redoutes%20des%20filles%20de%20couleur%20saint%20domingue&amp;f=false The Black Urban Atlantic in the Age of the Slave Trade]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Burnard, John Garrigus: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FNM7DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=saint+domingue+white+women&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiak8LRta_VAhVmQZoKHVyhDY0Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=quadroon%20balls&amp;f=false The Plantation Machine: Atlantic Capitalism in French Saint-Domingue]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The French colony, where the male population outnumbered women, white women were few and there were few alternatives to prostitution for free women of color, was known in the Caribbean for its "Mulatto Courtesans", whose trademark was elegance, a haughty demeanor and the demand to be courted.&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt; As there were no brothels in the colony, where sex workers worked independently, these balls were the place where the most exclusive courtesans met their clients; having met, they were set up as the official housekeeper or openly kept as mistresses,&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt; and when their male client died or left for France, they were normally left with money, property or slaves for their future support.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart R. King: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ESy9AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=juli+dahey+saint+domingue&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nlcLr4Wg4y&amp;sig=-MjhjIZwwApjYg6s_9H0cOWRfQo&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eJ-UVIBL4qLIA9KtgdAN&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=juli%20dahey%20saint%20domingue&amp;f=false Blue Coat Or Powdered Wig: Free People of Color in Pre-revolutionary Saint Domingue]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1805, a man named Albert Tessier began renting a dance hall where he threw twice weekly dances for free quadroon women and white men only.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Guillory, "Under One Roof: The Sins and Sanctity of the New Orleans Quadroon Balls", 80&lt;/ref&gt; These dances were elegant and elaborate, designed to appeal to wealthy white men. Although race mixing was prohibited by New Orleans law, it was common for white gentleman to attend the balls, sometimes stealing away from white balls to mingle with the city's quadroon female population. The principal desire of quadroon women attending these balls was to become ''placée'' as the mistress of a wealthy gentleman, usually a young white Creole or a visiting European.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Guillory, "Under One Roof: The Sins and Sanctity of the New Orleans Quadroon Balls", 81&lt;/ref&gt; These arrangements were a common occurrence, Guillory suggests, because the highly educated, socially refined quadroons were prohibited from marrying white men and were unlikely to find Black men of their own status.

A quadroon's mother usually negotiated with an admirer the compensation that would be received for having the woman as his mistress. Typical terms included some financial payment to the parent, financial and/or housing arrangements for the quadroon herself, and, many times, paternal recognition of any children the union produced. Guillory points out that some of these matches were as enduring and exclusive as marriages. A beloved quadroon mistress had the power to destabilize white marriages and families, something she was much resented for.

According to Guillory, the system of plaçage had a basis in the economics of mixed race. The plaçage of black women with white lovers, Guillory writes, could take place only because of the socially determined value of their light skin, the same light skin that commanded a higher price on the slave block, where light skinned girls fetched much higher prices than did prime field hands.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Guillory, "Under One Roof: The Sins and Sanctity of the New Orleans Quadroon Balls", 82&lt;/ref&gt; Guillory posits the quadroon balls as the best among severely limited options for these near-white women, a way for them to control their sexuality and decide the price of their own bodies. She contends, "The most a mulatto mother and a quadroon daughter could hope to attain in the rigid confines of the black/white world was some semblance of economic independence and social distinction from the slaves and other blacks" (83). She notes that many participants in the balls were successful in actual businesses when they could no longer rely on an income from the plaçage system. She speculates they developed business acumen from the process of marketing their own bodies.

'''Polis – The Jerusalem Institute of Languages and Humanities''' is a non-profit academic institution based in Jerusalem, Israel. It was           founded in 2011 by an international group of scholars who aimed at a renewal of the humanities through the study of Western and Eastern cultural sources.

Sharing the conviction that languages are the key to our cultural and spiritual heritage, these scholars sensed a need for change in the way ancient languages have been taught since the 19th century. With this in mind, they developed a teaching method intended to allow true language acquisition.

Drawing from the most recent developments in Applied Linguistics and from the Israeli expertise in teaching Modern Hebrew (the Ulpan method), the Polis method attempts to teach the so-called "dead languages" the same way modern languages are usually taught: in a monolingual, full-immersive environment.

It is located in [[Musrara, Jerusalem|Musrara]], near the [[Old City of Jerusalem]].

==History==

The Institute was registered in 2011 (cfr. Non Profit Registry (in Hebrew)) and opened [[Modern Hebrew]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] courses along with [[Ancient Greek]] throughout the year. The main idea was to teach ancient languages as living ones, and to put together teachers of different languages in order to share techniques between them. They soon realized the importance of full immersion during the lessons in the language taught, with both modern and ancient languages. They counted especially on the methods for teaching [[Modern Hebrew]] in Israel and on the experience of Prof. Christophe Rico teaching [[Ancient Greek]].

The main reason for running this activity as a non-profit organization was to foster the culture of dialogue through languages to as many people as possible. It soon became a contribution to better understanding of the different ethnic and religious groups present in Jerusalem.

In 2013, the Institute opened a [[M.A. degree|Master's program]] in [[Philology|ancient Philology]], which brought together several students and scholars from the US and Europe.

In the same years, Polis has organized intensive courses in other countries, such as Italy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.pusc.it/centri/dipartimento-di-lingue/home/corsiestivi Corsi stivi alla usc]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peru]], US,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avemaria.edu/Portals/0/GMC/blog/classics/Polis-Institute-Courses-at-AMU.pdf Hebrew and Latin Intensive Course] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002095925/http://www.avemaria.edu/Portals/0/GMC/blog/classics/Polis-Institute-Courses-at-AMU.pdf |date=2 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uic.es/en/news/uic-and-polis-institute-promote-study-classic-languages Universitat Internacional de Catalunya]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morocco]] and the [[Philippines]].

==The Polis Method==

=== The principles ===
The Polis method encompasses a variety of approaches and techniques unified under two major tenets:

a)     Language learning must take place in a full immersive environment, where only the target language is spoken;

b)     Grammatical structures must be learned according to their natural order of acquisition.

Taking these principles into account, Polis sets together and adapts a wide range of approaches and teaching techniques that have been developed since the 70’s in the States and Canada.

=== Teaching techniques ===

==== Total Physical Response ====
[[Total physical response|Total Physical Response]] (TPR) is a language teaching technique that was first developed by the psychologist James Asher (San José State University) based on his observations of language acquisition in young children. Although the theory behind TPR and the term itself have reached the general public only in the late 70’s, when professor Asher published a book entitled ''Learning Another Language through Actions'', many of Asher’s ideas have a lot in common with those advocated in the late 19th and early 20th century by [[W. H. D. Rouse]], known for his Natural or [[Direct method (education)|Direct Method]].

Within the Polis Method, TPR appears by the very first class and it is present in every step of the learning process. In the first session the student is only required to react physically to a series of commands given by the instructor, and no verbal interaction is expected to take place. More advanced students, however, are asked to describe their actions as they are performed, to verbally anticipate actions or to describe what they have just seen. Though TPR activities tend to decrease as the course progresses, it has been proved quite fruitful even in the most advanced stages, when students face some particularly complex structures, such as the genitive absolute in Greek or the ''accusativus cum infinitivo.''

==== Storytelling ====
Storytelling is a technique created in the 90’s by Spanish teacher Blaine Ray, inspired by [[Stephen Krashen|Steven Krashen]]’s theory on foreign language acquisition and its emphasis on the role of  "comprehensible input" in a student’s mastering of elocution (output). According to Krashen, it is essential that students are exposed to sentences whose meaning they can fully grasp, a feature that requires a strict control of how and when new words and structures are presented, in order to limit new words to a small percentage of the whole message.

In order to provide students with a teaching environment where "comprehensible input" could take place, Blaine Ray developed a series of stories or narrations in which students can be actively engaged. Throughout the narration, the students are presented with messages that correspond to their linguistic level, allowing the introduction of new vocabulary.

Adapting the practice of storytelling, the Polis Method completely excludes translations and explanations in any language other than the one being taught. Another development of the Polis Method consists of often asking students to respond in a complete sentence rather than only by single words, encouraging them to internalize speaking skills.

==== Story building ====
The Story Building technique was first developed by Greg Thomson (University of Alberta) in 2007 within the ''Growing Participator Approach'' (GPA) method. His theory rests on the presentation of images in vignettes which, with each successive image, form a consistent story. Students are then invited to describe the images presented by employing the vocabulary they know. This exercise reinforces retention and permits the insertion of new grammatical structures tied to the images and vocabulary.

Within the Polis method, the Story building technique is often used to practice the switch from present to past tense.

==== Images and props ====
Since human memory is largely dependent on sensorial experience, the use of images and props is a very effective tool to present new vocabulary, enabling students to directly associate a new word with a sensorial experience.

==== Conversation in pairs or small groups ====
Conversations between students in class is a common feature in modern language teaching, applied, through the Polis method, to the teaching of ancient languages. This interaction is a very effective tool, in more advanced classes, for as the student practices producing speech he or she progresses in language acquisition. Guided conversations may engage from two to five students at a time and are carefully designed to maximize each student’s speaking time and minimize error.

==== Other activities and techniques ====
Since activities requiring the language as its sole vehicle can help a great deal in creating a more natural immersive experience, students are encouraged to attend extra-class activities such as the full immersion lunches, where students and teachers dine together while speaking exclusively in the target language.

Songs are also another feature that helps Polis students retain vocabulary and grammar. During the first year of ancient Greek course, for example, some ten songs are taught.

== Academic Programs ==

=== M.A in Ancient Philology ===
The M.A in Ancient Philology is a two-year program dedicated to Ancient Greek and Biblical Hebrew, with an optional track, '''Emphasis in Teaching Ancient Languages,''' focused on the particularities of teaching ancient languages in an immersive setting.

=== M.A. in Near Eastern Languages ===
This program encompasses courses in Modern Hebrew and Arabic, with Biblical Hebrew, Aramaic, and Syriac as electives.

=== One-year Programs ===
Each MA program has a corresponding abridged version called the One Year Program (OYP).

=== Greek Fluency Program ===
This is a two-year academic program focused solely on ancient Greek.

=== Summer programs ===
During summer, Polis offers many intensive language courses, both in Jerusalem and abroad.

=== Language Courses ===
It holds regular language courses in '''''Koine Greek''''', '''''Biblical Hebrew''''', '''''Modern Hebrew''''' (Ulpan), '''''Latin''''', '''''Modern Standard Arabic''''', '''''Spoken Arabic''''' (Palestinian dialect), '''''Classical Syriac''''' and '''''Sumerian'''''.

== Conferences ==
The Institute hosts international conferences on various topics in the field of Humanities.

Three annual conferences have been held so far:

2016 – The Cours de Linguistique Générale revisited: 1916-2016

2015 – The Library of Alexandria

2013 – The Origins of the Alphabet

==Urban Context==
The [[Musrara, Jerusalem|Musrara neighbourhood]], formerly a place of [[Social conflict|social]] and [[ethnic conflicts]], is experiencing today a remarkable renewal: artists, intellectuals, international [[Volunteering|volunteers]] and workers are moving to the neighbourhood, which is becoming peaceful and multicultural. Together with other cultural institutions, such as the Art school Musrara, the School for Arabic music and the "On the Seam" Museum, Polis contributes to the rebuilding of the neighbourhood's image. The central location of the quarter, at the crossroad of several different cultures, as well as its history and its [[picturesque]]ness, make it one of the most popular for Tourism . The Institute is located near several important research centers in Humanities, such as the [[École Biblique|EBAF]], the [[Swedish Theological Institute]] and the [[Mount Scopus]] campus of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]], as well as to important monuments of [[Jerusalem]]: the [[Dome of the Rock]], the [[Jerusalem City Hall|City Hall]] and the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulchre]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1462">The '''Platinum-Cobalt Scale''' ('''Pt/Co scale''' or '''Apha-Hazen Scale''' ) is a color scale that was introduced in 1892 by chemist [[Allen Hazen]] (1869–1930). The index was developed as a way to evaluate [[pollution]] levels in waste water. It has since expanded to a common method of comparison of the intensity of yellow-tinted samples. It is specific to the color yellow and is based on dilutions of a 500 [[Parts per million|ppm]] platinum cobalt solution. The [[ASTM]] has detailed description and procedures in ASTM Designation D1209, "Standard Test Method for Color of Clear Liquids (Platinum-Cobalt Scale)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunterlab.com/appnotes/an11_96br3.pdf|title=FAQ - How to Measure Color of a Sample &amp; Use An Index - HunterLab|first=|last=HunterLab|website=www.hunterlab.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Designation D1209-00, "Standard Test Method for Color of Clear Liquids (Platinum-Cobalt Scale)," [[ASTM International]], [[West Conshohocken]], PA, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hazen, A., "The Measurement of the Colors of Natural Waters," ''American Chemist Journal'' (18:264), 1896&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sentientism''' is an ethical philosophy that grants degrees of moral consideration to all [[Sentience|sentient]] beings.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Linzey|first1=A|title=Sentientism|journal=Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare|date=1998|page=311|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/LINS-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sentientism extends [[humanism]] by showing compassion for non-human animals as well as potential artificial and alien intelligences.  In common with humanism, sentientism rejects supernatural beliefs in favour of critical, evidence-based thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Woodhouse |first1=Jamie |title=Humanism needs an upgrade |url=https://areomagazine.com/2018/10/07/humanism-needs-an-upgrade-the-philosophy-that-could-save-the-world/ |website=Areo |accessdate=21 November 2018|date=2018-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Sentientism proposes that sentience, the ability to experience suffering or flourishing, should determine whether we grant moral consideration to an entity&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Ryder|first1=Richard D.|title=Sentientism|journal=The Great Ape Project|pages=220–222|date=1993|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/RYDS}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Non-sentient entities do not warrant direct moral consideration because they can not experience the implications of our decisions.

Sentientist thinking has a long history, from [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation]]&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book
|last = Bentham
|first = Jeremy
|authorlink = 
|title = An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation
|publisher = Methuen
|series =  
|year = 1780
|doi = 
|isbn = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; through to contemporary philosophers such as [[Richard D. Ryder]] and [[Peter Singer]].

Sentientism differs from [[Speciesism]] in that it uses degrees of sentience, rather than species boundaries, to grant degrees of moral consideration.

Sentientism differs from [[painism]]&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Ryder|first1=Richard D.|title=Painism versus utilitarianism|journal=Think|date=2009|volume=8|issue=21|page=85|doi=10.1017/S1477175608000420|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/think/article/painism-versus-utilitarianism/8C7F06412FC4DC9305BAA3D6E5871109}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that it acknowledges the full range of experience, not just that of pain, in warranting moral consideration. 

Sentientism agrees with [[Animalism (philosophy)|Animalism]] that humans are animals so both warrant moral consideration. However, sentientism argues that non-animal sentient beings, such as potential artificial or alien intelligences, would also warrant moral consideration.  

==Notable Sentientists==

'''Soft foot''' is a common term used for machine frame distortion. The distortion is caused when one or more feet of a machine differ in height from the others. This in turn may be due to differences when the machine was manufactured, a squishy footage with oil film etc. between foot and base, a bent foot, or it may be induced by a pipe to which the machine is attached (e.g. a pipe on top of a pump), which prevents the machine from touching all its feet to its base.

Soft foot usually gives rise to a 1x harmonic of the rotation [[frequency]] in the [[spectrum]] when radial (horizontal or vertical) [[vibration]] measurements are taken. It can be detected in this way.

Similar harmonic 1x is caused by [[Shaft misalignment|misalignment]] and looseness. Usually not only will it resemble them, but it also causes misalignment, imbalance and other problems. In fact, it may be loose, not strictly a soft foot. Therefore, a way to tell the difference is needed.

To differentiate soft foot from misalignment and looseness, even if it causes misalignment when present, one way is to loosen each foot bolt at a time, while the other three are tight. If loosening one of them reduces vibration amplitude (which would be opposite to what one would expect if the machine was all right and we caused looseness by unscrewing of the bolt), then soft foot was present.

Another way to differentiate soft foot from looseness are phase measurements between the machine foot and the base/ground. 180 degrees difference indicates loose]ness.

Mesofauna contribute to habitable pore spaces and account for a small portion of total pore spaces.  [[Clay]] soils have much smaller particles which reduce pore space.

[[File:Juniperus communis range map.gif|thumb|300px|A [[range (biology)|species range]] map represents the region where individuals of a species can be found. This is a range map of ''[[Juniperus communis]]'', the common [[juniper]].]]

'''Species distribution''' is the manner in which a biological [[taxon]] is spatially arranged. The geographic limits of a particular taxon's distribution is its '''range''', often represented as shaded areas on a map. Patterns of distribution change depending the scale at which they are viewed, from the arrangement of individuals within a small family unit, to patterns within a population, or the distribution of the entire [[species]] as a whole (range). Species distribution is not to be confused with [[biological dispersal|dispersal]], which is the movement of individuals away from their [[center of origin|region of origin]] or from a population center of high [[population density|density]].

==Range==
In [[biology]], the '''range''' of a [[species]] is the geographical area within which that species can be found. Within that range, '''distribution''' is the general structure of the species [[population]], while dispersion is the variation in its [[population density]].

Range is often described with the following qualities:
* Sometimes a distinction is made between a species' natural, [[endemism|endemic]], [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]], or '''native range''', where it has historically originated and lived, and the range where a species has more recently established itself. Many terms are used to describe the new range, such as non-native, naturalized, [[introduced species|introduced]], transplanted, [[invasive species|invasive]], or colonized range.&lt;ref name=col2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Colautti |first1=Robert I. |first2=Hugh J. |last2=MacIsaac |title=A neutral terminology to define ‘invasive’ species |work=Diversity and Distributions |volume=10 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=135–41 |issn=1366-9516 |url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/parry/502_reading/Colautti2004.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1366-9516.2004.00061.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Introduced'' typically means that a species has been transported by humans (intentionally or accidentally) across a major geographical barrier.&lt;ref name=rich2000&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Richardson |first1=David M. |last2=Pysek |first2=Petr |last3=Rejmanek |first3=Marcel |last4=Barbour |first4=Michael G. |last5=Panetta |first5=F. Dane |last6=West |first6=Carol J. |title=Naturalization and invasion of alien plants: concepts and definitions |work=Diversity and Distributions |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=93–107 |issn=1366-9516 |doi=10.1046/j.1472-4642.2000.00083.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For species found in different regions at different times of year, especially [[season]]s, terms such as '''summer range''' and '''winter range''' are often employed.
* For species for which only part of their range is used for breeding activity, the terms '''breeding range''' and '''non-breeding range''' are used.
* For mobile animals, the term '''natural range''' is often used, as opposed to areas where it occurs as a [[vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]].
* Geographic or temporal qualifiers are often added, such as in ''British range'' or ''pre-1950 range''. The typical geographic ranges could be the latitudinal range and [[elevation]]al range.

[[Disjunct distribution]] occurs when two or more areas of the range of a taxon are considerably separated from each other geographically.

==Factors affecting distribution==
Distribution patterns may change by [[season]], distribution by humans, in response to the availability of resources, and other [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] and [[Abiotic component|biotic]] factors.
===Abiotic===
There are three main types of abiotic factors:
#climatic factors consist of sunlight, atmosphere, humidity, temperature, and salinity;
#[[edaphic]] factors are abiotic factors regarding soil, such as the coarseness of soil, local geology, soil pH, and aeration; and
#social factors include land use and water availability. 

An example of the effects of abiotic factors on species distribution can be seen in drier areas, where most individuals of a species will gather around water sources, forming a clumped distribution.

Researchers from the Arctic Ocean Diversity (ARCOD) project have documented rising numbers of warm-water crustaceans in the seas around Norway's Svalbard Islands. Arcod is part of the Census of Marine Life, a huge 10-year project involving researchers in more than 80 nations that aims to chart the diversity, distribution and abundance of life in the oceans. Marine Life has become largely affected by increasing [[effects of global warming]]. This study shows that as the ocean temperatures rise species are beginning to travel into the cold and harsh Arctic waters. Even the snow crab has extended its range 500&amp;nbsp;km north.

===Biotic===
Biotic factors such as predation, disease, and competition for resources such as food, water, and mates, can also affect how a species is distributed. For example, biotic factors in a quail’s environment would include their prey (insects and seeds), competition from other quail, and their predators, such as the coyote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Biotic_factor|title=Biotic factor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advantage of a herd, community, or other clumped distribution allows a population to detect predators earlier, at a greater distance, and potentially mount an effective defense. Due to limited resources, populations may be evenly distributed to minimize competition,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Reece. Biology. eight edition&lt;/ref&gt; as is found in forests, where competition for sunlight produces an even distribution of trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Abiotic_factor|title=Abiotic factor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[human impact on the environment|Humans]] are one of the largest distributors due to the current trends in [[globalization]] and the expanse of the [[transportation]] industry. For example, large [[tanker (ship)|tankers]] often fill their ballasts with water at one port and empty them in another, causing a wider distribution of aquatic species.

==Patterns on large scales==
On large scales, the pattern of distribution among individuals in a population is clumped.&lt;ref name=molles&gt;{{cite book |last1=Molles, Jr. |first1=Manuel C. |title=Ecology:  concepts and applications |date=2008 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |isbn=9780073050829 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bird wildlife corridors===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
One common example of bird species' ranges are land mass areas bordering water bodies, such as oceans, rivers, or lakes; they are called a ''coastal strip''. A second example, some species of bird depend on water, usually a river, swamp, etc., or water related forest and live in a ''river corridor''. A separate example of a river corridor would be a river corridor that includes the entire drainage, having the edge of the range delimited by mountains, or higher elevations; the river itself would be a smaller percentage of this entire wildlife corridor, but the corridor is created because of the river.

A further example of a bird wildlife corridor would be a mountain range corridor. In the U.S. of North America, the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range in the west, and the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in the east are two examples of this habitat, used in summer, and winter, by separate species, for different reasons.

Bird species in these corridors are connected to a main range for the species (contiguous range) or are in an isolated geographic range and be a [[disjunct distribution|disjunct]] range. Birds leaving the area, if they [[bird migration|migrate]], would leave connected to the main range or have to fly over land not connected to the wildlife corridor; thus, they would be [[passage migrant]]s over land that they stop on for an intermittent, hit or miss, visit.
==Patterns on small scales==
[[File:Population distribution.svg|thumb|right|Three basic types of population distribution within a [[range (biology)|regional range]] are (from top to bottom) uniform, random, and clumped.]]

On large scales, the pattern of distribution among individuals in a population is clumped. On small scales, the pattern may be clumped, regular, or random.&lt;ref name=molles/&gt;

===Clumped===
Clumped distribution is the most common type of dispersion found in nature. In clumped distribution, the distance between neighboring individuals is minimized. This type of distribution is found in environments that are characterized by patchy resources. Animals need certain resources to survive, and when these resources become rare during certain parts of the year animals tend to “clump” together around these crucial resources. Individuals might be clustered together in an area due to social factors such as [[selfish herd]]s and family groups. Organisms that usually serve as prey form clumped distributions in areas where they can hide and detect predators easily.

Other causes of clumped distributions are the inability of offspring to independently move from their habitat. This is seen in juvenile animals that are immobile and strongly dependent upon parental care. For example, the [[bald eagle]]'s nest of eaglets exhibits a clumped species distribution because all the offspring are in a small subset of a survey area before they learn to fly. Clumped distribution can be beneficial to the individuals in that group. However, in some herbivore cases, such as cows and wildebeests, the vegetation around them can suffer, especially if animals target one plant in particular.

Clumped distribution in species acts as a mechanism against predation as well as an efficient mechanism to trap or corner prey. African wild dogs, ''[[Lycaon pictus]]'', use the technique of communal hunting to increase their success rate at catching prey. Studies have shown that larger packs of African wild dogs tend to have a greater number of successful kills. A prime example of clumped distribution due to patchy resources is the wildlife in Africa during the dry season; lions, hyenas, giraffes, elephants, gazelles, and many more animals are clumped by small water sources that are present in the severe dry season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Creel | first = N.M. and S. | title = Communal Hunting and Pack Size in African Wild Dogs, ''Lycaon pictus'' | journal = Animal Behaviour | year = 1995 | pages = 1325–1339|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80048-4 | volume=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been observed that extinct and threatened species are more likely to be clumped in their distribution on a phylogeny. The reasoning behind this is that they share traits that increase vulnerability to extinction because related taxa are often located within the same broad geographical or habitat types where human-induced threats are concentrated. Using recently developed complete phylogenies for mammalian carnivores and primates it has been shown that the majority of instances threatened species are far from randomly distributed among [[taxa]] and [[phylogenetic]] [[clade]]s and display clumped distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Purvis | first1 = A | last2 = Agapowe | first2 = P-M | last3 = Gittleman | first3 = JL | last4 = Mace | first4 = GM | year = 2000 | title = Non-random extinction and the loss of evolutionary history | url = | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = | pages = 328–330 | doi=10.1126/science.288.5464.328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contiguous distribution is one in which individuals are closer together than they would be if they were randomly or evenly distributed, i.e., it is clumped distribution with a single clump. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fishbase.de/glossary/Glossary.php?q=aggregated%2Fclumped%2Fcontiguous+distribution "Aggregated/clumped/contiguous distribution"], &lt;/ref&gt;

===Regular or uniform===
Less common than clumped distribution, uniform distribution, also known as even distribution, is evenly spaced. Uniform distributions are found in populations in which the distance between neighboring individuals is maximized. The need to maximize the space between individuals generally arises from competition for a resource such as moisture or nutrients, or as a result of direct social interactions between individuals within the population, such as territoriality. For example, penguins often exhibit uniform spacing by aggressively defending their territory among their neighbors. The burrows of [[great gerbil]]s for example are also regularly distributed,&lt;ref name="Wilschut 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilschut|first1=L.I|last2=Laudisoit|first2=A.|last3=Hughes|first3=N.K|last4=Addink|first4=E.A.|last5=de Jong|first5=S.M.|last6=Heesterbeek|first6=J.A.P.|last7=Reijniers|first7=J.|last8=Eagle|first8=S.|last9=Dubyanskiy|first9=V.M.|last10=Begon|first10=M.|title=Spatial distribution patterns of plague hosts: point pattern analysis of the burrows of great gerbils in Kazakhstan|journal=Journal of Biogeography|date=19 May 2015|volume=42|issue=7|pages=1281–1292|doi=10.1111/jbi.12534|pmc=4737218}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be seen on satellite images.&lt;ref name="Wilschut 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilschut|first1=L.I|last2=Addink|first2=E.A.|last3=Heesterbeek|first3=J.A.P.|last4=Dubyanskiy|first4=V.M|last5=Davis|first5=S.A.|last6=Laudisoit|first6=A.|last7=Begon|first7=M.|last8=Burdelov|first8=L.A.|last9=Atshabar|first9=B.B.|last10=de Jong|first10=S.M.|title=Mapping the distribution of the main host for plague in a complex landscape in Kazakhstan: An object-based approach using SPOT-5 XS, Landsat 7 ETM+, SRTM and multiple Random Forests|journal=International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation|date=2013|volume=23|pages=81–94|doi=10.1016/j.jag.2012.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants also exhibit uniform distributions, like the creosote bushes in the southwestern region of the United States. ''[[Salvia leucophylla]]'' is a species in California that naturally grows in uniform spacing. This flower releases chemicals called [[terpenes]] which inhibit the growth of other plants around it and results in uniform distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mauseth | first = James | authorlink = James Mauseth | title = Botany: An Introduction to Plant Biology | publisher = [[Jones and Bartlett Publishers]] | year = 2008 | pages = 596 | isbn = 0-7637-5345-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of [[allelopathy]], which is the release of chemicals from plant parts by leaching, root exudation, volatilization, residue decomposition and other processes. Allelopathy can have beneficial, harmful, or neutral effects on surrounding organisms. Some allelochemicals even have selective effects on surrounding organisms; for example, the tree species ''[[Leucaena leucocephala]]'' exudes a chemical that inhibits the growth of other plants but not those of its own species, and thus can affect the distribution of specific rival species. Allelopathy usually results in uniform distributions, and its potential to suppress weeds is being researched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Fergusen | first= J.J |author2=Rathinasabapathi, B | title= Allelopathy: How Plants Suppress Other Plants | url= http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/HS186 | year= 2003| work= | publisher= | accessdate=2009-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farming and agricultural practices often create uniform distribution in areas where it would not previously exist, for example, orange trees growing in rows on a plantation.

===Random===
Random distribution, also known as unpredictable spacing, is the least common form of distribution in nature and occurs when the members of a given species are found in environments in which the position of each individual is independent of the other individuals: they neither attract nor repel one another. Random distribution is rare in nature as biotic factors, such as the interactions with neighboring individuals, and abiotic factors, such as climate or soil conditions, generally cause organisms to be either clustered or spread. Random distribution usually occurs in habitats where environmental conditions and resources are consistent. This pattern of dispersion is characterized by the lack of any strong social interactions between species. For example; When [[dandelion]] [[seeds]] are dispersed by wind, random distribution will often occur as the seedlings land in random places determined by uncontrollable factors. Oyster larvae can also travel hundreds of kilometers powered by sea currents, which can result in their random distribution.

==Statistical determination of distribution patterns==
There are various ways to determine the distribution pattern of species. The [[Clark–Evans nearest neighbor method]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
|title=Distance to Nearest Neighbor as a Measure of Spatial Relationships in Populations
|author=Philip J. Clark and Francis C. Evans
|journal=Ecology
|volume= 35
|issue=4
|date=Oct 1954
|pages= 445–453
|publisher= Ecological Society of America
|doi=10.2307/1931034}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to determine if a distribution is clumped, uniform, or random.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Blackith | first = R. E. | title = Nearest-Neighbour Distance Measurements for the Estimation of Animal Populations | publisher = Ecology | year = 1958 | pages = 147–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To utilize the Clark–Evans nearest neighbor method, researchers examine a population of a single species. The distance of an individual to its nearest neighbor is recorded for each individual in the sample. For two individuals that are each other's nearest neighbor, the distance is recorded twice, once for each individual. To receive accurate results, it is suggested that the number of distance measurements is at least 50. The average distance between nearest neighbors is compared to the expected distance in the case of random distribution to give the ratio:

: &lt;math&gt;R = (\text{mean distance}) \times 2\sqrt{\text{density}}&lt;/math&gt;

If this ratio ''R'' is equal to 1, then the population is randomly dispersed. If ''R'' is significantly greater than&amp;nbsp;1, the population is evenly dispersed. Lastly, if ''R'' is significantly less than&amp;nbsp;1, the population is clumped. Statistical tests (such as t-test, chi squared, etc.) can then be used to determine whether ''R'' is significantly different from&amp;nbsp;1.

The variance/mean ratio method focuses mainly on determining whether a species fits a randomly spaced distribution, but can also be used as evidence for either an even or clumped distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Banerjee | first = B. | title = Variance to mean ratio and the spatial distribution of animals | publisher = Birkhäuser Basel | year = 1976 | pages = 993–994}}&lt;/ref&gt; To utilize the Variance/Mean ratio method, data is collected from several random samples of a given population. In this analysis, it is imperative that data from at least 50 sample plots is considered. The number of individuals present in each sample is compared to the expected counts in the case of random distribution. The expected distribution can be found using [[Poisson distribution]]. If the variance/mean ratio is equal to 1, the population is found to be randomly distributed. If it is significantly greater than 1, the population is found to be clumped distribution. Finally, if the ratio is significantly less than 1, the population is found to be evenly distributed. Typical statistical tests used to find the significance of the variance/mean ratio include [[Student's t-test]] and [[Chi-squared test|chi squared]].

However, many researchers believe that species distribution models based on statistical analysis, without including ecological models and theories, are too incomplete for prediction. Instead of conclusions based on presence-absence data, probabilities that convey the likelihood a species will occupy a given area are more preferred because these models include an estimate of confidence in the likelihood of the species being present/absent. Additionally, they are also more valuable than data collected based on simple presence or absence because models based on probability allow the formation of spatial maps that indicates how likely a species is to be found in a particular area. Similar areas can then be compared to see how likely it is that a species will occur there also; this leads to a relationship between habitat suitability and species occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ormerod | first = S.J. |author2=Vaughan, I.P. | year = 2005 | title = The continuing challenges of testing species distribution models | journal = Journal of Applied Ecology | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 720–730 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118735253/abstract | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01052.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Species distribution models==
{{see also|Environmental niche modelling}}

Species distribution can be predicted based on the pattern of biodiversity at spatial scales. A general hierarchical model can integrate disturbance, dispersal and population dynamics. Based on factors of dispersal, disturbance, resources limiting climate, and other species distribution, predictions of species distribution can create a bio-climate range, or bio-climate envelope. The envelope can range from a local to a global scale or from a density independence to dependence. The hierarchical model takes into consideration the requirements, impacts or resources as well as local extinctions in disturbance factors. Models can integrate the dispersal/migration model, the disturbance model, and abundance model. Species distribution models (SDMs) can be used to assess climate change impacts and conservation management issues. Species distribution models include: presence/absence models, the dispersal/migration models, disturbance models, and abundance models. A prevalent way of creating predicted distribution maps for different species is to reclassify a land cover layer depending on whether or not the species in question would be predicted to habit each cover type. This simple SDM is often modified through the use of range data or ancillary information, such as elevation or water distance.

Recent studies have indicated that the grid size used can have an effect on the output of these species distribution models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~ebuford/MB_species1.html|title=Species Distribution Modeling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard 50x50 km grid size can select up to 2.89 times more area than when modeled with a 1x1 km grid for the same species. This has several effects on the species conservation planning under climate change predictions (global climate models, which are frequently used in the creation of species distribution models, usually consist of 50–100&amp;nbsp;km size grids) which could lead to over-prediction of future ranges in species distribution modeling. This can result in the misidentification of protected areas intended for a species future habitat.

==Species Distribution Grids Project==
The Species Distribution Grids Project is an effort led out of the University of Columbia to create maps and databases of the whereabouts of various animal species. This work is centered on preventing deforestation and prioritizing areas based on species richness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthsky.org/radioshows/52945/malanding-jaiteh-on-where-species-live |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414020826/http://www.earthsky.org/radioshows/52945/malanding-jaiteh-on-where-species-live |archivedate=2009-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2009, data are available for global amphibian distributions, as well as birds and mammals in the Americas. The map gallery [http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/species/map_gallery.jsp Gridded Species Distribution] contains sample maps for the Species Grids data set. These maps are not inclusive but rather contain a representative sample of the types of data available for download:

'''The Cloisters''' in [[Letchworth Garden City]], [[Hertfordshire]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] was built in 1905 as an open-air school dedicated to [[Psychology]] and where students were taught skills from the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. After a period of neglect during [[World War II]] The Cloisters became the North Hertfordshire Masonic Centre in 1951.

==Annie Jane Lawrence==
[[File:Annie Jane Lawrence 1910.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Annie Jane Lawrence c1910]]
The Cloisters was built by [[Quaker]] Miss Annie Jane Lawrence (16 April 1863&amp;ndash;3 August 1953), the daughter of Alfred Lawrence (1826 - 1875), who, with his brother Frederick, owned 'Lawrence Brothers, Smiths and Founders', and his wife Mary Elizabeth (née Ridge, 1838-1903).&lt;ref name=Miles&gt;Miles, V.W., ''The Cloisters, Letchworth, 1907-1967'' Published by The Lawrence Cloisters Trust (1967) pg 7&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandfather William Lawrence (1789-1855) came from humble origins but went on to be elected Master of the [[Worshipful Company of Carpenters]] in 1848 and an Alderman of the [[City of London]], while her uncle [[Sir James Lawrence, 1st Baronet|Sir James Lawrence]] was [[Lord Mayor of London]] in 1868. Her younger brother was the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, 1st Baron Pethick-Lawrence]] (1871-1961).&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;[http://thecloisters.org.uk/About.aspx About The Cloisters - A Brief History - The Cloisters, Letchworth website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 she was a pupil at the School for Ladies in [[Hove]] in [[Sussex]], while in 1895 she visited Boston in the USA.&lt;ref name=Ancestry/&gt; 

As a young woman she undertook social work in the slums of London, which urged her on to action. Lawrence decided to build a centre dedicated as a school of thought from which adults could go out and effect social change. She chose Letchworth because it was the world's First Garden City; here she leased three acres of land on which she built The Cloisters and Cloisters Lodge, intending that the former should be a School of Philosophy while she lived in the latter.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

==Design==
The design reputedly came to Miss Lawrence in a dream. The building originally consisted of a large half-oval 'open-air room' called the `Cloisters Garth' with an open colonnade to the south and large glazed bays to the north; this was flanked by two wings, one housing the kitchen and store rooms and the other the cubicles and dressing rooms for an oval open-air swimming pool. It was designed according to the principles of the Arts and Crafts movement, and was built using [[marble]]s and other materials from all over [[Europe]].

==1905-1907==
Originally built as an open-air school dedicated to [[Psychology]], with accommodation for 20 students, students were encouraged to study "how thought affects action and what causes and produces thought." Through healthy outdoor living it was intended that the students would develop healthy minds. The building was also designed to hold lectures, conferences, drama and musical performances as well as organ recitals. Students were also taught skills from the [[Arts and Crafts movement]].&lt;ref name=Miles/&gt;

Designed by [[architect]] [[William Harrison Cowlishaw]], building commenced on the {{convert|3|acre|m2|adj=on}} site in 1905, and the building opened on 17 January 1907, having cost the then huge sum of £20,000. Miss Lawrence built a house for herself, 'Cloisters Lodge', alongside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utopia-britannica.org.uk/pages/Cloisters.htm Utopia Britannica - British Utopian Experiments 1325 - 1945]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1907-1939==
[[File:cloisters1908.jpg|The Cloisters in 1908|thumb|right]]
A small community developed at ''The Cloisters'' dedicated to [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. It became the base for the ''Alpha Union'' set up by J. Bruce Wallace of the Brotherhood Church, who organised summer schools and residential courses there. Miss Lawrence, although somewhat deaf, was a great music lover. On one occasion she brought The London Concert Orchestra, made up of 40 unemployed musicians, to play at the Cloisters Garth. This was part of an ongoing series of concerts that she organised attended by audiences of 1,000, making organ recitals, band and choral concerts a regular part of the new town's cultural life. The last concert was given by the Brotherhood Orchestra in 1939 on the day the [[Second World War]] broke out.

== History since 1939==
[[File:Cloistersletchworth1b.JPG|thumb|right|The Masonic Temple at The Cloisters]]
The Cloisters was commandeered by the Army during the [[Second World War]] and suffered damage. By 1948 Miss Lawrence found it increasingly difficult to maintain the building and to repair the damage caused by the Army. She initially offered it to the local Council, who turned it down. Eventually, she offered it to the local [[Freemasons]] who accepted it, turning it into the [[North Hertfordshire]] [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Centre. About sixty [[Masonic lodges]] and 'side degrees' meet at The Cloisters, and the centre is run and maintained by an elected Board of Trustees, The Lawrence Cloisters Trust. A Craft Lodge, the 'Cloisters Lodge No 7100' was formed there in 1951 to commemorate Miss Lawrence's generous gift of the building to [[Hertfordshire]] [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]].&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, Jack ''The Cloisters, Letchworth'' in ''Freemasonry Today'' Issue 11 (Winter 1999/2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/16291128?versionId=19104779 Christodoulou, Glenn ''The Cloisters Lodge: the Next Twenty-Five Years'' Privately printed  by the Cloisters Lodge No. 7100 Festival Committee  (2001) [[National Library of Australia]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Miss Lawrence eventually moved out of Cloisters Lodge into a house on Willian Way in Letchworth but her increasing frailty led to her moving to St Catherine's Nursing Home where she died aged 90 on 3 August 1953.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; She is buried in the churchyard of [[Church of All Saints, Willian|All Saints Church]] in [[Willian, Hertfordshire|Willian]] in [[Hertfordshire]]. In her will she left £41,246 2s 6d to George Ernest Hinman (Solicitor) and her brother the Rt. Hon. [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, 1st Baron Pethick-Lawrence|Frederick William Pethick-Lawrence]].&lt;ref name=Ancestry&gt;[http://person.ancestry.co.uk/tree/87123076/person/80019953384/facts Annie Jane Lawrence - [[Ancestry.com]] - pay to view]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Cloisters has been designated by Letchworth Garden City Corporation as one of the 'great historic buildings' of [[North Hertfordshire]]. It is a Grade II* [[listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1102019|desc=The Cloisters|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013 The Cloisters appeared in episode 4 of [[ITV Network|ITV]]'s five-part series ''Britain's Secret Homes'', placing it in 16th place out of 50 historic buildings in Britain selected by [[English Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/britains-secret-homes/episode-4/ 'Britain's Secret Homes: Episode 4' on the '[[English Heritage]]'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although structurally sound, in October 2013 the building was put on [[English Heritage]]'s 'At Risk Register' owing mainly to the poor condition of its roof tiles which have allowed water to cause damage.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical building 'at risk' says English Heritage' - 'HItchin, Letchworth &amp; Baldock Advertiser'' October 16, 2013 pg 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The Cloisters on at risk register' - ''The Hitchin Comet'' October 17, 2013 pg 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Culture'' series''' is a [[science fiction]] [[book series|series]] written by Scottish author [[Iain Banks|Iain M. Banks]]. The stories centre on [[the Culture]], a [[utopia]]n, [[Post-scarcity economy|post-scarcity]] space society of [[humanoid]]s, [[extraterrestrial life|alien]]s, and very advanced [[artificial intelligence]]s living in [[socialism|socialist]] habitats spread across the [[Milky Way]] galaxy. The main theme of the novels is the dilemmas that an idealistic [[hyperpower]] faces in dealing with civilizations that do not share its ideals, and whose behavior it sometimes finds repulsive. In some of the stories, action takes place mainly in non-Culture environments, and the leading characters are often on the fringes of (or non-members of) the Culture, sometimes acting as agents of Culture (knowing and unknowing) in its plans to civilize the galaxy.

==The Culture==
{{main|The Culture}}
The Culture is a society formed by various [[humanoid]] races and [[artificial intelligence]]s about 9,000&amp;nbsp;years before the events of novels in the series. Since the majority of its biological population can have virtually anything they want without the need to work, there is little need for laws or enforcement, and the culture is described by Banks as space [[socialism]].&lt;ref name="BanksAFewNotes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1996UtopiasAndHeterotopias"/&gt; It features a [[post-scarcity economy]]&lt;!-- the Banks source [which source? -- another editor] is explicit that it is material scarcity being represented in the series, not ordinary "scarcity" as the term is used in economics, which includes scarcity of time, or having even abundant resources always available in large amounts at every point where the humans (or humanoids) might want them. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Parsons |first=Michael |last2=Banks |first2=Iain M |title=Interview: Iain M Banks talks 'The Hydrogen Sonata' with Wired.co.uk |publisher=[[Wired UK]] |date=16 November 2012 |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/16/iain-m-banks-the-hydrogen-sonata-review |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6d1slP9vx?url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/16/iain-m-banks-the-hydrogen-sonata-review |archivedate=2015-11-14 |quote=It is my vision of what you do when you are in that post-scarcity society, you can completely indulge myself.

Although the Culture has more advanced technology and a more powerful economy than the vast majority of known civilizations, it is just one of the "Involved" civilizations that take an active part in galactic affairs. The much older [[Homomda]] are slightly more advanced at the time of ''Consider Phlebas'' (this is, however, set several centuries before the other books, and Culture technology and martial power continues to advance in the interim);&lt;ref name="Banks1987ConsiderPhlebasIdiranWar"/&gt; the [[List of societies of the Culture setting#Morthanveld|Morthanveld]] have a much larger population and economy, but are hampered by a more restrictive attitude to the role of AI in their society.&lt;ref name="Banks2008Matter"/&gt; The capabilities of all such societies are vastly exceeded by those of the Elder civilisations (semi-retired from Galactic politics but who remain supremely potent) and the Sublimed, entities which have abandoned their material form for a non-corporeal, multi-dimensional existence, but these generally refrain from intervention in the material world.&lt;ref name="JacksonHeilman2008OutsideContextProblems"/&gt;

Some other civilizations hold less favorable views of the Culture.&lt;ref name="Horwich2002CultureClash"/&gt; At the time of their war with the Culture, the [[Idiran]]s and some of their allies regarded the control that the Minds exercised over the Culture as a form of [[idolatry]].&lt;ref name="Brown1996UtopiasAndHeterotopias"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Banks1987ConsiderPhlebas"/&gt; The Homomda regard the Culture as idealistic and hyper-active.&lt;ref name="Banks2000LTW"/&gt; Some members of the Culture have seceded to form related civilizations, known collectively as the Ulterior. These include the Peace Faction, the AhForgetIt Tendency and the [[Zetetic Elench]]. Others simply drop out temporarily or permanently.&lt;ref name="Banks1996Excession"/&gt;

Banks described the Culture as "some incredibly rich lady of leisure who does good, charitable works... Contact does that on a large scale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richmondreview.co.uk/features/banksint.html |title=A Quick Chat With Iain M. Banks |publisher=The Richmond Review |accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same need to find a purpose for existence led the Culture as a whole to embark voluntarily on its only full-scale war, to stop the expansion of the [[theocratic]] and [[militaristic]] [[Idiran]]s—otherwise the Culture's economic and technological advancement would have been a pointless exercise in [[hedonism]].&lt;ref name="Banks1987ConsiderPhlebasIdiranWar"/&gt;

All of the stories feature the tension between the Culture's humane, [[anarcho-communist]] ideals and its need to intervene in the affairs of less enlightened and often less advanced civilisations.&lt;ref name="Brown1996UtopiasAndHeterotopias"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=C. |title=Impossibility Fiction |editor=Littlewood, D. |editor2=Stockwell, P. |publisher=Rodopi |date=September 1996 |pages=57–73 |chapter=Utopias and Heterotopias: The 'Culture' of Iain M.

In subsequent novels, the Culture—particularly SC and, to a lesser degree, Contact—continue to employ subterfuge, [[espionage]], and even [[Direct action (military)|direct action]] (collectively called "dirty tricks") in order to protect itself and spread the Culture's "good works" and ideals. These dirty tricks include blackmailing persons, employing mercenaries, recruiting [[double agent]]s, attempting to effect [[regime change]], and even engaging in [[false flag]] operations against the Culture itself (potentially resulting in the death of billions).&lt;ref name="Brown1996UtopiasAndHeterotopias" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Banks1996Excession" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Banks1988PlayerOfGames" /&gt; Though each of these individual actions would horrify the average Culture citizen, the Culture's Minds tend to justify these actions in terms of lives saved in the long-term, perhaps over the course of several hundred years. The Culture is willing to use not only preemptive, but also retaliatory actions in order to deter future hostile actions against itself. Banks commented that in order to prevent atrocities, "even the Culture throws away its usual moral rule-book."&lt;ref name="GravitasShipNames" /&gt; Andrew M. Butler noted that, "Having established the peaceful, utopian, game-playing tendencies of the Culture, ... in later volumes the Culture’s dirty tricks are more exposed."&lt;ref name="Butler2003British Boom"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Butler |first=A.M. |date=November 2003 |title=The British Boom: What boom?

The Culture stories have been described as "eerily prescient".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baker |first=N. |title=The True Knowledge of Ken MacLeod|editor=Butler, Andrew M. |editor2=Mendelsohn, F. |publisher=Science Fiction Foundation |location=Reading, UK |year=2003 |pages=95–97 |chapter=Review of Dark Light}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Consider Phlebas'' explicitly presents a [[clash of civilizations]],&lt;ref name="Duggan2007BanksPostmodernismAndGulfWar" /&gt; although this phrase was coined by [[Samuel P.

Much of ''Look to Windward'' is a commentary on the Idiran-Culture war, from a viewpoint 800&amp;nbsp;years later, mainly reflecting grief over both personal and large-scale losses and guilt over actions taken in the war. It combines these with similar reflections on the catastrophic miscarriage of the Culture's attempt to dissolve the Chelgrians' oppressive caste system. In neither case, however, does distress over the consequences of Culture policy lead its representatives to reject that policy. The book illustrates the limitations of power, and also points out that Minds and other AIs are as vulnerable as biological persons to grief, guilt and regrets.&lt;ref name="Duggan2007BanksPostmodernismAndGulfWar"/&gt;

==Place within science fiction==
{{main|Science fiction|Space opera}}
When the first Culture stories appeared, science fiction was dominated by [[cyberpunk]], a pessimistic subgenre that worried about, but offered no solutions for, the [[offshoring]] of jobs to countries with lower costs or less strict regulations, the increasing power of corporations and the threats to privacy posed by computer networks. The Culture stories are [[space opera]], with certain elements that are free from scientific realism, and Banks uses this freedom extravagantly in order to focus on the human and political aspects of his universe; he rejects the dystopian direction of present day [[capitalism]], which both cyberpunk and earlier space operas assume, in creating a communist society as the primary civilization of focus.&lt;ref name="Mendelsohn2005Excession"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mendelsohn |first=F. |title=A Companion to Science Fiction |editor=Seed, D. |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2005 |pages=559–566 |chapter=Iain M.Banks: ''Excession'' |isbn=1-4051-1218-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HO_z5WFKwpoC&amp;pg=PP12&amp;dq=culture+%22iain+m+banks%22+ |accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Space opera had peaked in the 1930s, but started to decline as magazine editors such as [[John W. Campbell]] demanded more realistic approaches. By the 1960s many space operas were satires on earlier styles, such as [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s [[Stainless Steel Rat]] and [[Bill, the Galactic Hero]] stories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Westfahl |first=G. |title=The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction |editor=James, E. |editor2=Mendelsohn, F. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |pages=197–208 |chapter=Space opera |isbn=0-521-01657-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; while televised and film space operas such as ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'' were thought to have dumbed down the subgenre.&lt;ref&gt;http://whatculture.com/film/15-blunders-that-ruined-j-j-abrams-star-trek-and-destroyed-the-franchise.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/documents/introduction72.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://macha.itc.griffith.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/handle/10072/31808/59792_1.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; The Culture stories did much to revive space opera.&lt;ref name="Johnson1998ExcessionReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler2003British Boom"/&gt;

==Literary techniques==
Banks has been described as "an incorrigible player of games" with both style and structure&amp;nbsp;– and with the reader.&lt;ref name="HoltSFX2007Player"/&gt; In both the Culture stories and his work outside science fiction, there are two sides to Banks, the "merry chatterer" who brings scenes to life and "the altogether less amiable character" who "engineers the often savage structure of his stories".&lt;ref name="Sleight2008Matter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.locusmag.com/Features/2008/03/locus-magazines-graham-sleight-reviews.html |title=Locus Magazine's Graham Sleight reviews Iain M. Banks |last=Sleight |first=G. |date=March 2008 |publisher=Locus Magazine |accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks uses a wide range of styles. ''[[The Player of Games]]'' opens in a leisurely manner as it presents the main character's sense of boredom and inertia,&lt;ref name="Eyrie2005ReviewPlayer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/reviews/books/0-06-105356-2.html |title=Review: ''The Player of Games'' by Iain M. Banks |date=18 November 2005 |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopts for the main storyline a "spare, functional" style that contrasts with the "linguistic fireworks" of later stories.&lt;ref name="HoltSFX2007Player"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holt |first=T. |date=November 2007 |title=Must-read Classic of SF Literature: ''The Player of Games'' |journal=SFX Magazine |pages=114 |url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/resources/sfx/SFX162playerofgames.pdf |accessdate=2009-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010093702/http://www.sfx.co.uk/resources/sfx/SFX162playerofgames.pdf |archivedate=October 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the styles used in ''[[Excession]]'' relate to the function and focal character of the scene: slow-paced and detailed for Dajeil, who is still mourning over traumatic events that happened decades earlier; a parody of huntin', shootin', and fishin' country gentlemen, sometimes reminiscent of [[P. G. Wodehouse]], when describing the viewpoint of the [[List of societies of the Culture setting#Affront|Affront]]; the ship ''Serious Callers Only'', afraid of becoming involved in the conflict between factions of [[Mind (The Culture)|Minds]], speaks in cryptic verse, while the ''[[Sleeper Service]]'', acting as a freelance detective, adopts a [[hardboiled]] style. On the other hand, Banks often wrong-foots readers by using prosaic descriptions for the grandest scenery, self-deprecation and humour for the most heroic actions, and a poetic style in describing one of the Affront's killings.&lt;ref name="Mendelsohn2005Excession"/&gt;

He delights in building up expectations and then surprising the reader.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Even in ''The Player of Games'', which has the simplest style and structure of the series, the last line of the epilogue reveals who was really pulling the strings all along.&lt;ref name="HoltSFX2007Player"/&gt; In all the Culture stories, Banks subverts many clichés of [[space opera]]. The Minds are not plotting to take over the universe, and no-one is following a grand plan.&lt;ref name="Mendelsohn2005Excession"/&gt; The darkly comic double-act of Ferbin and Holse in ''[[Matter (novel)|Matter]]'' is not something most writers would place in "the normally po-faced context of space opera".&lt;ref name="Sleight2008Matter"/&gt; Even the [[List_of_spacecraft_in_the_Culture_series|names of Culture spaceships]] are jokes&amp;nbsp;– for example ''Lightly Seared on the Reality Grill'', ''Experiencing a Significant Gravitas Shortfall'' (part of a [[running gag]] in the series&lt;ref name="GravitasShipNames"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepages.compuserve.de/Mostral/interviews/guardian00.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124054925/http://homepages.compuserve.de/Mostral/interviews/guardian00.htm |archivedate=24 November 2007 |accessdate=2009-02-15 |title=Iain Banks&amp;nbsp;– Interview}} Originally published in [[The Guardian]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt;) and ''Liveware Problem'' (see [[liveware]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/09/fiction.iainbanks |accessdate=2009-02-15 |last=Poole. |first=S. |title=Review&amp;nbsp;– "Matter" by Iain M. Banks |date=9 February 2008 |location=London |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks often uses "outsiders" as viewpoint characters,&lt;ref name="Vint2007Bodies"&gt;{{cite book |last=Vint |first=S. |title=Bodies of tomorrow |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2007 |pages=79–101 |chapter=3&amp;nbsp;– Iain M. Banks: The Culture-al Body|isbn=0-8020-9052-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5PITXl1fSMC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=%22Iain+M.+Banks%22+culture+outsider |accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said that using an enemy of the Culture as the main character of ''Consider Phlebas'', the first story in the series, enabled him to present a more rounded view of the Culture.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} However, this character realises that his attempts to plan for anything that might conceivably happen on a mission are very similar to the way in which the Culture makes all its decisions, and by the end suspects he has chosen the wrong side.&lt;ref name="Horwich2002CultureClash"/&gt;

The focal character of ''The Player of Games'' is bored with the lack of real challenges in his life,&lt;ref name="Horwich2002CultureClash"/&gt; is blackmailed into becoming a Culture agent, admires the vibrancy of the Azad Empire but is then disgusted by its brutality,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} and wins the final of the tournament by playing in a style that reflects the Culture's values.&lt;ref name="Horwich2002CultureClash"/&gt;

''Use of Weapons'' features a non-Culture mercenary who accepts the benefits of association with the Culture, including immortality as the fee for his first assignment, and completes several dangerous missions as a Culture agent, but complains that he is kept in the dark about the aims of his missions and that in some of the wars he has fought maybe the Culture was backing both sides, with good reason.&lt;ref name="Horwich2002CultureClash"/&gt;

''Look to Windward'' uses three commentators on the Culture, a near-immortal Behemothaur, a member of the race plunged into civil war by a Culture intervention that went wrong, and the ambassador of a race at similar technological level to the Culture's.&lt;ref name="Gevers2000LTWReview"/&gt;

The action scenes of the Culture stories are comparable to those of blockbuster films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Palmer |first=C. |date=March 1999 |title=Galactic Empires and the Contemporary Extravaganza: Dan Simmons and Iain M. Banks |journal=Science Fiction Studies |volume=26 |issue=1 |url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/77/palmer77.htm |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Banks said he would like ''[[Consider Phlebas]]'' to be filmed "with a very, very, very big budget indeed" and would not mind if the story were given a [[happy ending]], provided the biggest action scenes were kept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sffworld.com/interview/2p1.html |title=Interview with Iain M.

Banks is unspecific about many of the background details in the stories, such as the rules of the game that is the centrepiece of ''The Player of Games'',&lt;ref name="Eyrie2005ReviewPlayer"/&gt; and cheerfully makes no attempt at scientific credibility.&lt;ref&gt;"I know it's all nonsense, but you've got to admit it's impressive nonsense." {{cite web|url=http://www.futurehi.net/phlebas/text/cultnote.html |title=A Few Notes on the Culture |last=Banks |first=I.M. |year=1994 |accessdate=2009-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322183158/http://www.futurehi.net/phlebas/text/cultnote.html |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genesis of the series==
Banks says he conceived the Culture in the 1960s, and that it is a combination of wish fulfilment and a reaction against the predominantly right-wing science fiction produced in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spikemagazine.com/iain-banks-interview.php |title=Iain Banks&amp;nbsp;– Interview |last=Lowe |first=G. |date=24 March 2008 |publisher=Spike Magazine |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, the Culture might be a "great place to live", with no exploitation of people or AIs, and whose people could create beings greater than themselves.&lt;ref name="Gevers2002CulturedFuturist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue274/interview.html |title=Cultured futurist Iain M. Banks creates an ornate utopia |last=Gevers |first=N. |year=2002 |accessdate=2009-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002115448/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue274/interview.html |archivedate=October 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his first published novel, ''[[The Wasp Factory]]'' (1984; not science fiction), was accepted in 1983, Banks wrote five books that were rejected, of which three were science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spikemagazine.com/0996bank.php |title=Iain Banks : ''Whit'' and ''Excession'': Getting Used To Being God |last=Mitchell |first=C. |date=3 September 1996 |publisher=Spike Magazine |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Banks' first draft of ''[[Use of Weapons]]'' in 1974, his third attempt at a novel, the Culture was just a backdrop intended to show that the mercenary agent was working for the "good guys" and was responsible for his own misdeeds. At the time he persuaded his friend [[Ken MacLeod]] to read it and MacLeod tried to suggest improvements, but the book had too much [[purple prose]] and a very convoluted structure. In 1984, shortly after ''The Wasp Factory'' was published, MacLeod was asked to read ''Use of Weapons'' again, and said there was "a good novel in there struggling to get out", and suggested the interleaved forwards and backwards narratives that appeared in the published version in 1990. The novella ''[[The State of the Art]]'', which provides the title of the 1991 collection, dates from 1979, the first draft of ''[[The Player of Games]]'' from 1980 and that of ''[[Consider Phlebas]]'' from 1982.&lt;ref name="Wilson1994BanksInterview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://textualities.net/tag/iain-m-banks/ |title=Iain Banks Interview |last=Wilson |first=A. |year=1994 |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2704">In [[astrophysics]], the '''thermal time scale''' or Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale is the approximate time it takes for a [[star]] to radiate away its total [[kinetic energy]] content at its current [[luminosity]] rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradt|first=Hale|title=Astrophysics Processes|date=2008|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=United States of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with the [[nuclear time scale|nuclear]] and [[dynamical time scale]]s, it is used to estimate the length of time a particular star will remain in a certain phase of its life and its lifespan if hypothetical conditions are met.  In reality, the lifespan of a star is greater than what is estimated by the thermal time scale because as one fuel becomes scarce, another will generally take its place--[[hydrogen burning]] gives way to [[helium burning]], which is replaced by [[carbon burning]].

==Stellar astrophysics==
The size of a star as well as its energy output generally determine a star's thermal lifetime because the measurement is independent of the type of fuel normally found at its center.  Indeed, the thermal time scale assumes that there is no fuel at all inside the star and simply predicts the length of time it would take for the resulting change in outputted energy to reach the surface of the star and become visually apparent to an outside observer.

&lt;math&gt; \tau_{th} = \frac{\mbox{total kinetic energy}}{\mbox{rate of energy loss}} = \cfrac{GM^2}{RL}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name = "Stellar Structure and Evolution"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kippenhahn|last2=Weigert|title=Stellar Structure and Evolution |url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642302558|publisher= Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where G is the [[gravitational constant]], M is the [[mass]] of the star, R is the [[radius]] of the star, and L is the star's [[luminosity#In astronomy|luminosity]].  As an example, the [[Sun]]'s thermal time scale is approximately 30 million years.

'''UCMSA Universalis''' is a multicultural and multidisciplinary student association directly affiliated with the [[University College Maastricht]]. It is run by UCM students for UCM students and contributes to both academic and social life at UCM. The association is involved in the organisation of debates, poetry readings, open-mic nights, parties, charity fundraisers, student representation, and other events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Schools/UCM/TargetGroup/ProspectiveStudents1/EducationalProfile/TheAcademicCommunity.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205021009/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Schools/UCM/TargetGroup/ProspectiveStudents1/EducationalProfile/TheAcademicCommunity.htm |archivedate=2010-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a structure typical of [[Maastricht University]] ''study associations,'' it is run by a student board. The Universalis student board consists of a Social Board, an Academic Council, and an Independent Body. Board positions are traditionally a semester to two semesters long. Active members of the association are organised as committees which provide services for all students at the college. All new students automatically become a member upon enrollment at the college. 

== Organisation structure ==
There are currently six members on the UCMSA Universalis Social Board: President, Treasurer, Secretary, External Executive, Social Executive, and Acquisitions Executive.  Currently only the President is elected by Universalis members, the rest of the Board are selected by the previous Board and then officialised through a public vote in a General Assembly.  Board members serve for one or two semesters after which they can re-apply.&lt;ref&gt;Pot, E.; Pagán, B. UCMSA Universalis Charter, Notarised 3 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Social Board meetings are held once a week.  Universalis's committees and societies operate under the Social Board, who seek to financially and logistically facilitate all committee activities.

The Academic Council works in parallel with the Study Association Board, with five members: Chair, Treasurer, Secretary, Events Coordinator, and External. The Council represents students in working with the [[University College Maastricht]]'s Board of Studies, who are responsible for evaluating academic courses and affairs. They also organize Academic conferences, guest speakers, academic workshops, and student exchanges with sister colleges. The Academic Council is funded by the Social Board, but works in conjunction with the Social Board.

The Independent Body consists of three to five students elected by a general assembly with the goal of keeping the Social Board and Academic Council in accordance with the association's Statutes and Policy Manual. They also serve a functional role in General Assemblies and voting procedures.

== History ==
At the beginning of September 2002 [[University College Maastricht|UCM]]'s first students gathered in the back yard of the newly founded college. Several students formed an informal ''founding committee'' to get a student society started.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, G.; Pot, E.; Pagán, B.; Wiebe, P.; Josten, L.; Plenter, J., UCM Study Association Universalis: Annual Report 2002-2003&lt;/ref&gt; Because the diversity of [[University College Maastricht|UCM]]'s students and its curriculum, they decided  that [[Leonardo da Vinci|Da Vinci]]'s [[Homo Universalis]] was a suitable symbol for the student society's identity. It represents the juxtaposition of different interests in its members and of the diverse [[University College Maastricht|UCM]] student body. The founding committee decided to call the association ''Universalis'' and Brian Pagán designed the logo, a stylised version of the [[Vitruvian Man]]. The first unofficial Universalis general meeting was held on 19 September 2002. The organisation's structure was drawn up by the founding committee and the first board was elected. The organisation was registered with the Maastricht [[Chamber of Commerce]] and certified by a [[Civil law notary|notary]] on 3 December 2002, marking the official establishment of UCM Study Association Universalis.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, G.; Pot, E.; Pagán, B.; Wiebe, P.; Josten, L.; Plenter, J., UCM Study Association Universalis: Annual Report 2002-2003&lt;/ref&gt;

UCMSA Universalis joined University College Student Representatives of the Netherlands (UCSRN) in &lt;year&gt; and has been an active member since.

'''Sir Walter Wilson Greg''' (9 July 1875 &amp;ndash; 4 March 1959), known professionally as '''W. W. Greg''', was one of the leading bibliographers and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] scholars of the 20th century.

==Family and education==

Greg was born at [[Wimbledon and Putney Commons|Wimbledon Common]] in 1875. His father, [[William Rathbone Greg]], was an essayist; his mother was the daughter of [[James Wilson (UK politician)|James Wilson]]. As a child, Greg was expected one day to assume editorship of ''[[The Economist]]'', which his grandfather had founded in 1843; Greg was educated at [[Wixenford School|Wixenford]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=GRG894WW|name=Greg, Walter Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Cambridge he met [[Ronald Brunlees McKerrow|Ronald McKerrow]], whose friendship helped shape Greg's decision to pursue a career in literature. While still in school he compiled a list of Renaissance plays printed before 1700, and he joined the [[Bibliographical Society]] the same year. He was President of the Society from 1930 to 1932&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibsoc.org.uk/about/presidents Past Presidents of The Bibliographical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; and received its Gold Medal in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibsoc.org.uk/about/gold-medalists Gold Medalists of The Bibliographical Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127022846/http://www.bibsoc.org.uk/about/gold-medalists |date=2014-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

After school, Greg settled into a life of steady productivity, while living on the proceeds of his shares of ''The Economist''. Working in close association with [[A. H. Bullen]], he produced ''Pastoral Poetry and Pastoral Drama'' (1906), the first edited version of the account books of [[Philip Henslowe]] (1906–8) and the papers of [[Edward Alleyn]]. The latter two works provided him with a knowledge of Renaissance theatrical conditions perhaps rivaled only by [[E. K. Chambers]], and this knowledge he applied to the publications of the [[Malone Society]], which he served as general editor between 1906 and 1939. He served as Librarian of Trinity College, 1907–13, resigning after his marriage to his cousin Elizabeth Gaskell. As an independent scholar,  Greg produced editions of ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' (1910),  [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]]'s ''Orlando Furioso'' and [[George Peele]]'s ''[[The Battle of Alcazar]]'' (published together, 1923), and ''[[Sir Thomas More (play)|Sir Thomas More]]'' (1911). He returned to specific editing with work on ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' (1950). Greg also wrote on the material conditions of [[English Renaissance theatre|Renaissance theater]] and publishing; his work in this regard includes ''Dramatic Documents from the Elizabethan Playhouses'' (1931) and ''English Literary Autographs, 1550–1650'' (1932). ''The Variants in the First Quarto of King Lear'' (1940) offered a careful examination of this printing. He also wrote hundreds of reviews, including a notably caustic rejection of [[J. Churton Collins]]'s 1905 Oxford edition of Robert Greene.

At the beginning of [[World War II]], Greg moved to [[Sussex]], where he spent the war working on his edition of ''Faustus.'' In addition, he began to prepare his great works of the 1950s: ''The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare'' (1951), ''The Shakespeare First Folio: Its Bibliographical and Textual History'' (1955), ''Some Aspects and Problems of London Publishing, 1550–1650'' (1954), and the essay "The rationale of copy-text" (1950), which had a significant influence on [[textual criticism]]. He was Lyell Reader in Bibliography at Oxford University, 1954–5. Greg was knighted in 1950.

Greg was strongly associated with [[Alfred W. Pollard]] in developing a modern understanding of the transmission of Shakespeare's texts. His greatest achievement{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} is ''A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration,'' published in four volumes between 1939 and 1959.

Recent history of changes in women's roles includes having [[women in the military]] in many countries.

==Africa==

=== Algeria ===
The presence of female soldiers in the Algerian army was of crucial importance during [[Women in the Algerian War|the Algerian revolution]] against colonial France, some of the most prominent figures and symbols of the National Liberation Front were female combatants. 

[[Fatima Zohra Ardjoune]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Par Mounir Kechar |url=http://www.algerlablanche.com/index.php?post/Pr-Fatima-Zohra-Ardjoune%2C-la-premi%C3%A8re-femme-g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral-de-l-arm%C3%A9e-alg%C3%A9rienne |title=Pr Fatima Zohra Ardjoune, la première femme général de l'armée algérienne - Alger La Blanche - Le Portail de l'Algérie |publisher=Alger La Blanche |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  director general of the Ain Naâdja military hospital, was promoted to general, the first woman in the Algerian People’s National Army (PNA)—and in the Arab world—to reach this rank. Three years later, Fatima Boudouani &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.middleeastobserver.org/2017/03/03/algerias-interest-in-world-security-stems-from-international-solidarity-principle-official/ |title=Algeria's interest in world security stems from international solidarity principle: Official |publisher=Middle East Observer |date= |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; became the second woman to be promoted to the rank of general in the [[wikipedia:People's National Army (Algeria)|PNA]], and she was followed by three more women in 2015, therefore becoming the Arab country with the biggest number of high-ranking female army commanders. &lt;ref name="muftah1"&gt;https://muftah.org/women-in-the-algerian-military-then-and-now/#.WTtiP-s1_IU&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alarabiya1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/2014/07/09/Algeria-appoints-four-female-army-generals-.html |title=Algeria appoints four female army generals |publisher=Al Arabiya English |date=2014-07-09 |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four generals were also promoted to the rank of major-general. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Algerian-woman-becomes-countrys-first-female-general |title=Algerian woman becomes country's first female general - Middle East - Jerusalem Post |publisher=Jpost.com |date=2009-07-05 |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aardjoun's promotion reflects a growing trend of Algerian women taking more prominent positions in the workforce, most notably in the police and military. Algeria boasts the largest number of female police officers in the Muslim world. The status of women in the military had been made legally equal to that of men in an ordinance on February 28, 2006, and the military’s promotions of women from 2009 to 2015 broke an apparent taboo. The army has since put in place a formal policy framework for equal opportunities, and efforts have been made to apply it. &lt;ref name="muftah1"/&gt;

Since 2005, Bouteflika has been under pressure to enact more changes in favor of women’s rights. &lt;ref name="alarabiya1"/&gt;

[[File:Africa Aerospace and Defense 2010 (5093447570).jpg|thumb|right|Female [[South African National Defence Force]] members speak with an American soldier during the [[Africa Aerospace and Defence]] expo in 2010.]]
South African women have a long history of service in the [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) and in the modern [[South African National Defence Force]] (SANDF). In [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] women served in auxiliary roles in the [[South African Defence Force]] and were assigned to non-combat active roles after 1970. In 1914 a volunteer nursing service was established by the army and 328 nurses to serve with South African troops in [[Europe]] and [[East Africa]] in World War I. The Women's Auxiliary Army Service began accepting women recruits in 1916. Officials estimated that women volunteers relieved 12,000 men for combat in World War I by assuming clerical and other duties. During World War II, South Africa had five service organizations for women—the South African Military Nursing Service, and women's auxiliaries attached to the army, the navy, the air force, and the military police.

During the late 1970s and 1980s, women were active in civil defence organizations and were being trained as part of the country's general mobilization against possible terrorist attacks. In 1989, for example, the Johannesburg Civil Defence Program provided training for 800 civil defense volunteers, about one-half of whom were women. These classes included such subjects as weapons training for self-defense, antiriot procedures, traffic and crowd control, first aid, and fire-fighting. An unreported number of women also received instruction in counterinsurgency techniques and commando operations. Women also served in military elements of liberation militias in the 1970s and the 1980s, and women were accepted into the [[ANC]]'s military wing, [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (Spear of the Nation, also known as Umkhonto—MK), throughout the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement|anti-apartheid struggle]].

In 1995 women of all races were being incorporated into the [[South African National Defence Force]] (SANDF), and a woman officer, Brigadier Jackie Sedibe, was appointed to oversee the implementation of new SANDF policies concerning the treatment of women. Women had been promoted as high as warrant officers and brigadiers in the Permanent Force by the early 1990s, but only ten women were SADF colonels in 1994. In 1996 Brigadier Sedibe became the first woman in the military to be promoted to the rank of major general. Widespread cultural attitudes in the 1990s still oppose the idea of women in combat, but officials are debating ways to assign women an equitable share of the leadership positions in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mongabay.com/history/south_africa/south_africa-women_in_the_military_homeland_militaries.html|title=South Africa-Women in the Military Homeland Militaries|website=www.mongabay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 almost 26.6% of the uniformed services of the South African National Defence Force consisted of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=16708:fact-file-sandf-regular-force-levels-by-race-a-gender-april-30-2011-&amp;catid=79:fact-files&amp;Itemid=159|title=Fact file: SANDF regular force levels by race &amp; gender: April 30, 2011  - defenceWeb|first=Leon|last=Engelbrecht|website=www.defenceweb.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All roles in the Australian Defence Force are open to women. The first women became involved with the Australian armed forces with the creation of the Army Nursing Service in 1899. On the 30th of June 2017, women were found to make up 16.5% of the [[Australian Defence Force]] (with 20.6% in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], 20.4% in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] and 13.2% in the [[Australian Army]]).&lt;ref name="Women in the ADF Report 2016-2017"&gt;http://www.defence.gov.au/annualreports/16-17/Downloads/WomenInTheADFReport2016-17.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, up until 2016, only 74% of the total number of available roles in the Australian armed forces were available to women. Despite this, using 1998-99 figures, the ADF had the highest percentage of women in its employ in the world.&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/archive/womenarmed |title=Women in the armed forces: the role of women in the Australian Defence Force – Parliament of Australia |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Australia became the fourth nation in the world to allow women to serve on its submarines.

Australia was the fourth country to permit female crew on submarines, doing so in June 1998 on board [[Collins class submarine]]s. Australia's first deployment of female sailors in a combat zone was aboard [[HMAS Westralia (O 195)|HMAS ''Westralia'']] in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]].

On 27 September 2011, Defence Minister Stephen Smith announced that women will be allowed to serve in frontline combat roles by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-27/women-on-the-frontline/2946258|title=Women cleared to serve in combat|publisher=ABC News|date=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, allegations of alleged sexual harassment on board [[HMAS Swan (DE 50)|HMAS ''Swan'']] were investigated, and in 1998 similar allegations arose in the [[Australian Defence Force Academy]].

[[File:Israeli military police women stand in formation during an honor cordon ceremony for Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates in Tel Aviv.JPEG|thumb|Israeli military police women (2007)]]
Some women served in various positions in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]], including infantry, radio operators and transport pilots in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War|1948 war of independence]] and the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, but later the Air Force closed its ranks to female pilots, and women were restricted from combat positions. There is a draft of both men and women. Most women serve in non-combat positions, and are conscripted for two years (instead of three years for men). A landmark high court appeal in 1994 forced the Air Force to accept women air cadets. In 2001, Israel's first female combat pilot received her wings. In 1999 the [[Caracal Battalion|Caracal]] company was formed, as a non segregated infantry company. In 2000 it was expanded into a Battalion (called The 33rd, for the 33 women killed in combat during the War of Independence) since then, further combat positions have opened to women, including Artillery, Field Intelligence, Search and Rescue, NBC, Border Patrol, K-9 Unit and anti-aircraft warfare.

On May 26, 2011, [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] Chief of Staff [[Benny Gantz]] announced Brigadier General [[Orna Barbivay]]'s appointment as the next Head of the IDF Personnel Directorate. Barbivay was promoted to [[Major General]], thus becoming the most senior female officer in the history of the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]].

===Japan===
[[File:Jsdf-候補生（新隊員前期）.jpg|thumb|Female candidates of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] (2011).]]
When the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] (JSDF), postwar armed forces of [[Japan]], was originally formed, women were recruited exclusively for the nursing services. Opportunities were expanded somewhat when women were permitted to join the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]] (JGSDF; army) communication service in 1967, the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (JMSDF; navy) and [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] (JASDF; air force) communication services in 1974. By 1991, more than 6,000 women were in the JSDF, about 80% of service areas, except those requiring direct exposure to combat, were open to them. The National Defense Medical College graduated its first class with women in March 1991, and the [[National Defense Academy of Japan]] began admitting women in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan Focus|url=http://japanfocus.org/-Fumika-Sato/3820|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
Singapore allows women to serve in combat roles, although females are not conscripted.

===Sri Lanka===
[[Sri Lanka Air Force]] (SLAF) was the first service of the Sri Lankan military to allow women to serve, accepting female recruits to the [[Sri Lanka Volunteer Air Force]] in 1972. The Sri Lanka Army followed in 1979 with the establishment of the [[Sri Lanka Army Women's Corps]] (SLAWC). Since then, each service has for both administrative and practical reasons maintained separate units for women. These are the SLAWC and the SLAF Women's Wing; the [[Sri Lanka Navy]] does not have a specific name for women's units. In order to maintain discipline, all three services have women [[Military police|MPs]] attached to their respective military police/provost corps.

Currently, female personnel of all three services play an active part in ongoing operations. However, there are certain limitations in 'direct combat' duties such as [[special forces]], pilot branch, naval fast attack squadrons. These are only a few restrictions; female personnel have been tasked with many front line duties and attached to combat units such as [[paratroops]], [[Sri Lanka Air Force Regiment|SLAF Regiment]], as well as undertaken support services such as [[Control tower|control tower operators]], [[Electronic warfare|electronic warfare technicians]], radio material teletypewriters, [[Auto mechanic|automotive mechanics]], [[Assault Support|aviation supply personnel]], [[cryptographers]], [[physician|doctors]], [[combat medic]]s, [[lawyers]], [[Combat engineering|engineers]] and [[Aerial photography|aerial photographers]]. In the [[Sri Lanka Navy]] female personnel were at first limited to the medical branch, however currently both lady officers and female rates are able to join any branch of service including the executive branch. With the escalation of the [[Sri Lankan civil war]], many female personnel have come under enemy fire both directly and indirectly thus taking many casualties including fatalities. As of 2008 there were three female officers of the rank of [[Major General]] and one [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]].

The [[Department of Civil Defence (Sri Lanka)|Sri Lanka Civil Defence Force]], formerly the Sri Lanka Home Guard, has been open to women recruits since 1988. In 1993, these guardswomen were issued firearms and deployed to protect their home towns and villages against attacks by [[LTTE]]. As a result, there have been many casualties (including fatalities) from attacks.

===Thailand===
Thailand has recently begun recruiting and training women to conduct counter-insurgency operations (c. 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/03/18/thailand.women.ap/ | work=CNN}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ranger commander said that when women are protesting, "It is better for women to do the talking.

==Europe==

===Denmark===
Women were employed in the Danish armed forces as early as 1934 with the Ground Observer Corps, Danish Women's Army Corps and Naval Corps in 1946 and the Women's Air Force since 1953. In 1962, the Danish parliament passed laws allowing women to volunteer in the regular Danish armed forces as long as they did not serve in units experiencing direct combat. 1971 saw the enlistment of women as non-commissioned officers, with military academies allowing women in 1974.

In 1978, based on the reports of studies on the topic, women were allowed to enlist in an all areas of the Danish armed forces, with combat trials in the eighties exploring the capabilities of women in combat. In 1998, laws were passed allowing women to sample military life in the same way as conscripted men, however without being completely open to conscription. Since then females have served in infantry units in both Iraq and in combat in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sorensjogren.com/2012/the-problem-with-women-in-combat-units/|title=HugeDomains.com - SoreNsJogRen.com is for sale (Sore Ns Jog Ren)|website=sorensjogren.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the Danish military come under the command of the Chief of Defense.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/ims/2001/win/denmark.htm|title=NATO/IMS: Committee on Women in the NATO Forces: Denmark&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2010, women make up 5% of the army, 6.9% of the navy, and 8.6% of air force personnel.

===Finland===
[[File:Naispunakaartilainen.jpg|thumb|125px|upright|Red Guard during the [[Finnish Civil War]]]]

The [[Finnish Defense Forces]] does not conscript women. However, since 1995, women between 18 and 30 years of age have the possibility of voluntarily undertaking military service in the Defence Forces or in the [[Finnish Border Guard|Border Guard]]. Women generally serve under the same conditions as men.

[[File:Lottia ilmavalvontatehtävissä.jpg|thumb|left|Members of [[Lotta Svärd]] in air control duty during the [[Continuation War]]]]
The history of women in the Finnish military is, however, far longer than just since 1995. During the [[Finnish Civil War]], the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Reds]] had several ''Naiskaarti'' (Women's Guard) units made of voluntary 16- to 35-year-old women, who were given rudimentary military training. The reactions on women in military were ambivalent during the Civil War.

The non-combat duties in Finnish Defence Forces [[peace-keeping]] operations opened to women in 1991. Since 1995 the women are allowed to serve in all combat arms including front-line infantry and special forces both in Finland and in operations outside Finland.

===France===
[[File:Cantiniere1800s.jpg|thumb|A [[Cantinière]] with a male infantry soldier in Algeria, around 1845. Painting by Edouard Moreau.]]

In the 1800s, women in the French military were responsible for preparing meals for soldiers, and were called [[cantinière]]s. They sold food to soldiers beyond that which was given to them as rations. Cantinières had commissions from the administrators of the regiments, and they were required to be married to a soldier of the regiment. They served near the front lines on active campaigns, and some served for as long as 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Following the drums: Cantinieres|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/c_cantinieres.html|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Wars of the French Revolution]], some women enlisted in the army, mainly in support roles. [[Angélique Brûlon|Marie-Angélique Duchemin]] is the first woman with a recorded rank in the French Army, being promoted Corporal and Acting Sergeant in 1794. She was promoted 2nd Lieutenant on the retired list in 1815. Duchemin is the first woman decorated with the [[Legion of Honor]], in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.napoleon.org/fr/salle_lecture/biographies/files/duchemin_delage_2007.asp fondation Napoléon]&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of women in the French military grew in 1914 with the recruitment of women as medical personnel (Service de Santé des Armées). In 1939, they were authorized to enlist with the armed service branches, and in 1972 their status evolved to share the same ranks as those of men. [[Valérie André]], a neurosurgeon, became the first woman in France to attain the rank of three-star general as Médecin Général Inspecteur. A veteran of the [[French Resistance]], she served overseas in [[Indochina]]. During that period, she learned how to pilot a helicopter so that she could reach wounded soldiers who were trapped in the jungle. André is the first woman to have flown a helicopter in combat. She received many decorations for her achievements, including the highest rank of the [[Legion of Honour]]. She retired from active service in 1981.


Today women can serve in every position in the French military, including submarines&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rfi.fr/france/20171204-France-have-its-first-women-submariners-mission France have its first women submariners on mission], [[Radio France International]], december 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and combat infantry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/france/20150223-journee-internationale-femme-militaire-commando-parachutiste-8-mars-defense A l'armée, une femme est un homme comme les autres], Radio France international, march 2015 {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; make up around 15% of all service personnel in the combined branches of the French military. They are 11% of the Army forces, 13% for the Navy, 21% of the Air Force and 50% of the Medical Corps. This is the highest proportion of female personnel in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les femmes de la Defense|url=https://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/487432/7798345/version/1/file/Les+femmes+dans+larmee+francaise-diptyque.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Defense, Government of France|accessdate=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Since the creation of the [[Bundeswehr]] in 1955, Germany had employed one of the most conservative gender-policies of any NATO country.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} That was generally regarded as a reaction to the deployment of young women at the end of [[World War II]]. Though women were exempt from direct combat functions in accordance with Nazi-ideology, several hundred thousand German women, along with young boys and sometimes girls (as [[Flakhelfer]]), served in Luftwaffe artillery units; their flak shot down thousands of Allied warplanes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/H491/combat.pdf D'Ann Campbell, "Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union" ''Journal of Military History'' (April 1993), 57:301-323]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1975 the first female medical officers were appointed in the ''Sanitätsdienst'' of the Bundeswehr. Since 1994, two women, [[Verena von Weymarn]] and Erika Franke, attained the rank of ''Generalarzt''. But it was not until January 2001 that women first joined German combat units, following a court ruling by the [[European Court of Justice]].

There are no restrictions regarding the branch of service, and there are woman serving in the "Fallschirmjäger" and as Tornado fighter pilot.

===Ireland===
In the Irish [[1916 Rising]], Cumann na mBan, the women's wing of the Irish Volunteers, fought alongside them in the streets of Dublin and in the General Post Office, the Irish Volunteers' HQ. [[Constance Markievicz]], an Irish Revolutionary and suffragette, commanded male and female troops during the Rising.

The Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1979, allowed women to join the [[Irish Defence Forces]] for the first time and was passed by the [[Oireachtas]] in 1979, making them the first European Armed Forces to allow women all roles in the military including combat roles, and even join the Irish Army Ranger Wing (Fianoglach), the Irish Special Forces, similar to the British SAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1979/en/act/pub/0028/index.html |title=Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1979 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=1979-11-06 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no restrictions for women to the "full range of operational and administrative duties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0658/D.0658.200807020061.html |title=Dáil Éireann - Volume 658 - 02 July, 2008 - Written Answers. - Defence Forces Personnel |publisher=Historical-debates.oireachtas.ie |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2010 the number of women in the Permanent Defence Forces is 565, 5.7 percent of the total.&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20100224.xml&amp;Page=1&amp;Ex=1236#N1236 ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
[[File:Italian Soldier Olypmic Games Turin 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Italian parachutist]]
During the short life of the [[Italian Social Republic]] (World War II), the Female Volunteer Unit was introduced as an auxiliary service and they were knwown as Female Auxiliary Unit ({{lang-it|Servizio Ausiliario Femminile}}). The law that introduced this unit provided that its existence be limited to war periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.tiscali.it/RSI_ANALISI/34.htm|title=Decreto istitutivo del Corpo femminile|access-date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its equivalent in Southern Italy during World War II, was the ''CAF'', {{lang-it|Corpo di Assistenza Femminile}}, that was on the side of the [[Allies]]. This unit was also dismissed at the end of the war. Those who belonged to this unit were equivalent to [[sub-lieutenants]] and wore military uniforms made in [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museobadoglio.altervista.org/docs/forze.pdf|title=Forze del Regno del Sud|access-date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, the Female Police unit ({{lang-it|Corpo di Polizia femminile}}) was established.

In 1981, Diadora Bussani was the first woman who asked to be admitted  into the Naval Academy of [[Livorno]] ({{lang-it|Accademia navale di Livorno}}). She was born in 1962 in [[Trieste]] and started her struggle to join the academy in 1981. After being excluded from the application, Italy's regional administrative court upheld the appeal; however, Italy's State Council overturned the judgment. The enlisting of a woman seemed to be legally feasible because of Italian law Legge 1963 n. 66 which allowed the enrollment of women in public positions, but the State Council excluded the military because of biological differences between male and female human bodies. When she became famous and the case was well-known, the [[United States Navy]] symbolically granted her enlistment on 2 November 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloogger.it/2018/06/italiane-in-armi/|title=Italiane in armi|date=5 June 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntary female military service was introduced in 1999 with the Italian law Legge 20 ottobre 1999 n. 380, which introduced the possibility of being admitted to the army for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informagiovani.it/frame/_donnemiliti.htm|title=Servizio militare femminile|website=www.informagiovani.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy was the last country among [[NATO]] members to allow women to join the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Editoria/Rassegna+Arma/2004/Suppl_3/I+Sessione/01_Sessione_03.htm#3|title=L'impatto del servizio militare femminile.

Nowadays women are present in all branches of Italian armed forces, including the police, and [[Guardia di Finanza]], and they are also employed for military missions abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.difesa.it/APPROFONDIMENTI/ARCHIVIOAPPROFONDIMENTI/SERVIZIO_FEMMINILE/Pagine/default.aspx|title=Ministero della Difesa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the year 2000, women were employed in war only as voluntary nurses inside organizations [[Croce Rossa Italiana]] and ''Corpo delle infermiere volontarie dell'ACISMOM''. 235º Reggimento fanteria "Piceno" is the training center for women inside the Italian army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esercito.difesa.it/organizzazione/capo-di-sme/comando-per-la-formazione-specializzazione-e-dottrina-dell-esercito/Scuola-di-Fanteria/Centro-Addestramento-Volontari/235-RAV-Piceno|title=235° Reggimento Addestramento Volontari|website=www.esercito.difesa.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
Women in Norway have been able to fill military roles since 1938, and during the Second World War both enlisted women and female officers served in all branches of the military. However, in 1947 political changes commanded that women only serve in civilian posts, with reservists allowing women to join them in 1959. Female personnel currently make up around 12% of the armed forces (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forsvaret.no/en/facts/the-armed-forces-in-numbers/personnel|title=Personnel|first=|last=Forsvaret|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1977 and 1984, the Norwegian Parliament passed laws expanding the role of women in the Norwegian Armed Forces, and in 1985 equal opportunities legislation was applied to the military.

In 1995, Norway allowed women to serve on its military [[submarines]], and to this date there has been at least one female commander of a Norwegian submarine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2002/issue4/english/interview.html|title=Nato Review|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was [[Solveig Krey]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mil.no/fakta/start/menneskene/kvinner/ |title=Forsvarsnett: Kvinner |publisher=Mil.no |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 conscription was extended to women making Norway the first [[NATO]] member and first European country to make national service compulsory for both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://forsvaret.no/en/newsroom/news-stories/female-conscription |title=Universal Conscription |publisher=Norwegian Armed Forces |date=11 June 2015 |access-date=25 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305005856/https://forsvaret.no/en/newsroom/news-stories/female-conscription |archive-date=5 March 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
[[File:Zolnierki 1920.JPG|thumb|175px|Polish female volunteers during the [[Polish-Soviet War]]]]
Women have taken part in the battles for independence against occupiers and invaders since at least the time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During the occupation by the [[Nazi]]s, 1939–1945, several thousand women took part in the resistance movement as members of the [[Home Army]] and the [[Polish People's Army|People's Army]]. The Germans were forced to establish special [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s after the [[Warsaw Rising]] in 1944 to accommodate over a thousand women prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polishresistance-ak.org/12%20Article.htm |title=Women in Home Army |publisher=Polishresistance-ak.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1938 the law requiring compulsory military service for men included provisions for voluntary service of women in auxiliary roles, in the medical services, in the anti-aircraft artillery and in communications. In 1939 a Women's Military Training Organization was established under the command of [[Maria Wittek]].

In present Poland a law passed April 6, 2004 requires all women with college nursing or veterinary degrees to register for compulsory service. In addition it allows women to volunteer and serve as professional personnel in all services of the army. As of June 30, 2007 there are 800 women in the army, of which 471 are officers, 308 non-commissioned officers and 21 other ranks, in addition 225 are in military training schools. Two active duty Polish women have achieved the rank of Colonel. [[Maria Wittek]] was the 1st Polish woman to reach the rank of General.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kadry.wp.mil.pl/artykul.php?idartykul=20 Women in army – in Polish] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104013702/http://www.kadry.wp.mil.pl/artykul.php?idartykul=20 |date=January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Kobiety w Wojsku Polskim|in Polish]], Retrieved 2013-11-14{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===

[[File:Military parade on Red Square 2017-05-09 028.jpg|thumb|Russian female cadets.]]
During the [[First World War]], heavy defeats led to the loss of millions of [[Russian Empire|Russian Imperial]] soldiers. To psychologically energize morale [[Alexander Kerensky]] (leader of Russia of the [[Russian Provisional Government]]) ordered the creation of the Woman’s Death Battalion in May 1917. After three months of fighting, the size of this all-female unit fell from 2,000 to 250.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wdeath.htm |title=Women's Death Battalion |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1917, the [[Bolsheviks]] dissolved the unit. Shortly after Russia became part of the [[Soviet Union]] (see above for the role of woman in Soviet military) until December 1991.

The current tally of woman in the Russian Army is standing at around 115,000 to 160,000, representing 10% of Russia’s military strength.

===Serbia===
  {{commonscat|Military women of Serbia}}
Although the Serbian armed forces were traditionally exclusively male (with exception of nurses and some other non-combat roles) there were some exceptions. Several women are known to have fought in the ranks in the [[Balkan Wars]] and the [[First World War]], often by initially hiding their gender to work around the draft regulations. The most notable of them was [[Milunka Savić]], the most decorated female combatant in history. In the [[Second World War]] [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav partisan units]] accepted female volunteers as combatants as well as medical personnel. After the war the practice was abandoned, but was reintroduced recently with professionalisation of the army.

===Sweden===
In the Military Articles of 1621, which organized the Swedish army, military men on all levels were explicitly allowed to bring their wives with them to war, as the wives were regarded to fill an important role as [[sutler]]s in the house hold organisation of the army: prostitutes, however, were banned.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"&gt;Sjöberg, Maria: ''Kvinnor i fält 1550-1850.'' [Women in Combat] Gidlund (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  This regulation was kept until the Military Article of 1798, though the presence of women diminished after the end of the [[Great Northern War]].&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt; In the Military Article of 1798, the only women allowed to accompany the army was the professional unmarried female sutlers, in Sweden named ''marketenterska''.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt; Unofficially, however, there were females who served in the army posing as male the entire period, the most famous being [[Ulrika Eleonora Stålhammar]].&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt;

In 1924, the [[Swedish Women's Voluntary Defence Service]] (Swedish: Riksförbundet Sveriges lottakårer, commonly known as Lottorna) was founded: it is an auxiliary defense organization of the [[Swedish Home Guard]], a part of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]].

Since 1989 there are no gender restrictions in the Swedish military on access to military training or positions. They are allowed to serve in all parts of the military and in all positions, including combat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rekryc.mil.se/article.php?id=11756 in Swedish, Retrieved 04-23-2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927045646/http://www.rekryc.mil.se/article.php?id=11756 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Female personnel currently make up around 13% of the Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;Swedish Armed Forces http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/om-myndigheten/vara-varderingar/jamstalldhet-och-jamlikhet/historik/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
When Turkish history is examined, it is apparent that Turkish women have voluntarily taken tasks in the defence of their country, showing the same power and courage as men. [[Nene Hatun]], whose monument has been erected in the city of Erzurum (Eastern Turkey) because of her gallant bravery during the Ottoman-Russian War, constitutes a very good example of this fact. Besides providing nursery services, women also took main roles in combat in WWI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haznevi.net/Kavramoku.aspx?KID=589&amp;KTID=6 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913011056/http://www.haznevi.net/Kavramoku.aspx?KID=589&amp;KTID=6 |archivedate=2014-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the Independence War has taken its place in history with the unsurpassed heroism of Turkish women.&lt;ref name="nato.int"&gt;http://www.nato.int/ims/2001/win/turkey.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sabiha Gökçen]] was the first female combat pilot in the world, as well as the first Turkish female aviator. She was one of the eight adoptive children of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]. Throughout her career in the Turkish Air Force, Gökçen flew 22 different types of aircraft for more than 8,000 hours, 32 hours of which were active combat and bombardment missions. She was selected as the only female pilot for the poster of "20 Greatest Aviators in History" published by the United States Air Force in 1996.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/gokcen.html |title=Sabiha Gokcen (1913-2001), Pioneer Aviatrix |publisher=Ctie.monash.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women personnel are being employed as officers in the Turkish Armed Forces today. The women officers serve together with the men under the same respective chains of command. The personnel policy regarding women in the Turkish Armed Forces is based on the principle of "needing qualified women officers in suitable branches and ranks" to keep pace with technological advancements in the 21st century. Women civilian personnel have been assigned to the headquarters staff, technical fields, and social services without sexual discrimination. Women officers serve in all branches except armor, infantry, and submarines. Assignments, promotions and training are considered on an equal basis with no gender bias.&lt;ref name="nato.int"/&gt;

As of the year 2005, the number of the female officers and NCOs in the Turkish Armed Forces is 1245.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.nato.int/ims/2005/win/national_reports/turkey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:The Auxiliary Territorial Service in the United Kingdom 1939 - 1945 H36315.jpg|thumb|right| ATS Searchlight Unit in the Second World War]]
Women were first employed by the [[Royal Navy]] in 1696 when a handful were employed as nurses and [[laundress]]es on [[hospital ship]]s.&lt;ref name=stark68 /&gt; They received pay equal to an [[Able Seaman (rank)|able seaman]].&lt;ref name=stark68 /&gt; The practice was always controversial and over the next two centuries first the nurses and the laundresses were removed from service.&lt;ref name=stark68 /&gt; By the start of the 19th century both roles had been eliminated.&lt;ref name=stark68&gt;{{cite book |title=Female Tars: Women Aboard Ship in the Age of Sail |last=Stark |first=Suzanne J. |year=1998 |publisher=Pimlico |isbn=978-0-7126-6660-2 |pages=68–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Female service in the Royal Navy restarted 1884 when the Naval Nursing Service was formed. It became the [[Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service]] in 1902 and is still in operation. Women have had active roles in the British Army since 1902, when the [[Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps]] was founded.  The [[Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service]] was formed in 1918. During the Second World War, about 600,000 women served in the three British women's auxiliary services: the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]], the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]], and the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]], as well as the nursing corps.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Milks, ''Women in the British Army: War and the Gentle Sex, 1907–1948'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, the [[Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps]] was formed; 47,000 women served until it was disbanded in 1921.  The [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] (WRNS) was formed in 1917 as well. Before it disbanded in 1919, it provided catering and administrative support, communications and electrician personnel.

In 1938, the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) was created, with 20,000 women serving in non-combat roles during World War II, including as [[military police]]. They also performed a combat role on British soil, as [[anti-aircraft gun]]ners against the [[Luftwaffe]]. 

In 1949, women were officially recognized as a permanent part of British Armed forces, although full combat roles were still restricted to men. In this year, the [[Women's Royal Army Corps]] was created to replace the ATS, and in 1950 the ranks were normalised with the ranks of men serving in the British Army. From 1949 to 1992, thousands of women served in the WRAC and sister institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Goldman, ed. ''Female Soldier: Combatants or Non-Combatants?

[[File:CWAC mechanic, 1944.jpg|thumb|upright|Private Lowry, [[Canadian Women's Army Corps|CWAC]], tightening up the springs on the front of her vehicle, Chelsea &amp; Cricklewood Garage, England, 7 July 1944.]]

During the First World War, over 2,300 women served overseas in the Canadian Army Medical Corps. During the Second World War, 5,000 women of the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps again served overseas, however they were not permitted to serve on combat warships or in combat teams. The Canadian Army Women's Corps was created during the Second World War, as was the Royal Canadian Air Force (Women's Division). As well, 45,000 women served as support staff in every theatre of the conflict, driving heavy equipment, rigging parachutes, and performing clerical work, telephone operation, laundry duties and cooking. Some 5,000 women performed similar occupations during Canada's part in the [[Korean War]] of 1950–1953.

In 1965 the Canadian government decided to allow a maximum of 1,500 women to serve directly in all three branches of its armed forces, and the former "women's services" were disbanded. In 1970 the government created a set of rules for the armed forces designed to encourage equal opportunities. In 1974 the first woman, Major Wendy Clay, earned her pilot's wings in the newly integrated [[Canadian Forces]].

Between 1979 and 1985 the role of women expanded further, with military colleges allowing women to enroll. In 1982 laws were passed ending all discrimination in employment, and combat related roles in the Canadian armed forces were opened for women, with the exception of the submarine service. In 1986 further laws were created to the same effect. The following years saw Canada's first female infantry soldier, and a female [[Brigadier-General]].

In 1989, a tribunal appointed under the Canadian Human Rights Act ordered full integration of women in the Canadian Armed Forces "with all due speed", at least within the next ten
years. Only submarines were to remain closed to women.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Symons, "Under Fire: Canadian Women in Combat," ''Canadian Journal of Women and the Law'' (1990) 4: 477–511&lt;/ref&gt;
Women were permitted to serve on board Canadian submarines in 2002 with the acquisition of the [[Upholder/Victoria-class submarine|''Victoria''-class submarine]]. Master Seaman Colleen Beattie became the first [[Submarine#Women|female submariner]] in 2003.

Canadian women have also commanded large infantry units and Canadian warships. Commander Josée Kurtz is the first woman appointed to command a major warship –  [[HMCS Halifax (FFH 330)|HMCS Halifax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/news/article.page?doc=canadian-armed-forces-historical-milestones-of-women/hie8w7rl|title=National Defence - Canadian Armed Forces - Fact Sheet - Canadian Armed Forces – Historical milestones of women|first=Government of Canada, National|last=Defence|website=www.forces.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first female American soldier was [[Deborah Sampson]] of [[Massachusetts]]. She enlisted as a [[Continental Army]] soldier under the name of "Robert Shurtliff". She served for three years in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and was wounded twice; she cut a musket ball out of her own thigh so no doctor would find out she was a woman.

During the [[American Civil War]], [[Sarah Rosetta Wakeman]] enlisted under the alias of Private Lyons Wakeman.

In the history of women in the military, there are records of female U.S. Revolutionary and Civil War soldiers who enlisted using male pseudonyms, but a letter written by [[Annie Oakley]] to President [[William McKinley]] on April 5, 1898 may represent the earliest documentary proof of a political move towards recognizing a woman's right to serve in the United States military. Oakley, sharpshooter and star in the [[Buffalo Bill]] [[Wild West Shows|Show]], wrote a letter to [[President of the United States|President]] [[William McKinley]] on April 5, 1898 "offering the government the services of a company of 50 'lady sharpshooters' who would provide their own arms and ammunition should war break out with Spain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/recover/example-02.html |title=Letter to President William McKinley from Annie Oakley |last=Oakley |first=Oakley |authorlink=Annie Oakley |date=5 April 1898 |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Spanish–American War]] did occur, but Oakley's offer was not accepted.

During [[World War I]], 21,498 U.S. Army nurses (military nurses were all women then) served in military hospitals in the United States and overseas. Eighteen African-American Army nurses served stateside caring for German prisoners of war ([[POWs]]) and African-American soldiers; after the Armistice, Nov. 11, 1918, they entered the Army Nurse Corps and cared for people. They were assigned to [[Camp Grant (Illinois)|Camp Grant, IL]], and [[Camp Sherman, Ohio|Camp Sherman, OH]], and lived in segregated quarters while caring for German POWs and black soldiers. African-American women also served in World War I as U.S. Yeomen (F). Of the 11,274 U.S. Yeomen (F) who served from 1917 to 1921, 14 were black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Women's Roles and Statuses the World Over |author1=Stephanie Hepburn|author2=Rita J.

The Yeoman (F) recruits and women Marines primarily served in [[clerk (position)|clerical]] positions. They received the same benefits and responsibilities as men, including identical pay (US$28.75 per month), and were treated as veterans after the war. The U.S. Army recruited and trained 233 female bilingual telephone operators to work at switchboards near the front in France and sent 50 skilled female stenographers to France to work with the Quartermaster Corps. The U.S. Navy enlisted 11,880 women as Yeomen (F) to serve stateside in shore billets and release sailors for sea duty. More than 1,476 U.S. Navy nurses served in military hospitals stateside and overseas. The U.S. Marine Corps enlisted 305 female Marine Reservists (F) to "free men to fight" by filling positions such as clerks and telephone operators on the home front. More than 400 U.S. military nurses died in the line of duty during World War I. The vast majority of these women died from a highly contagious form of influenza known as the "[[Spanish Flu]]", which swept through crowded military camps and hospitals and ports of embarkation. Women were quickly demobilized when hostilities ceased, and aside from the Nurse Corps the soldiery became once again exclusively male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/WomenChronology.asp|title=Women's History Chronology|publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]]|accessdate=2011-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Highlights in the History of Military Women |url= http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html |accessdate= 2011-03-11 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629034939/http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html |archivedate= 2011-06-29 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news|title=Women in the military — international|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ |publisher=CBC News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014025906/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ |archivedate=October 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Women's Army Corps|Woman’s Army Auxiliary Corps]], the women's branch of the United States Army, was established in the United States on 15 May 1942 by Public Law 554, and converted to full status as the WAC on 1 July 1943. The [[WAVES|Woman’s Naval Reserve]] was also created during [[World War II]]. In 1944 women from the [[Women's Army Corps]] (WACs) arrived in the Pacific and landed in Normandy on [[D-Day]]. During the war, 67 Army nurses and 16 [[United States Navy Nurse Corps|Navy nurses]] were captured and spent three years as Japanese prisoners of war. There were 350,000 American women who served during World War II and 16 were killed in action; in total, they gained over 1,500 medals, citations, and commendations. Additionally, by the end of WW II, Women Ordnance Workers (WOWs) accounted for approximately 85,000 of all civilian employees, working for the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goordnance.army.mil/history/ORDhistory.html|title=History of the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps|website=www.goordnance.army.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ordnance soldiers ''and'' civilians worked across the globe, ranging from Iceland, Iran, the Pacific Islands, Africa, and Europe, to the Middle East.

[[Virginia Hall]], serving with the [[Office of Strategic Services]], received the second-highest US combat award, the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], for action behind enemy lines in France. Hall, who had one artificial leg, landed clandestinely in occupied territory aboard a British [[Motor Torpedo Boat]].

Law 625, [[Women's Armed Services Integration Act|The Women's Armed Services Act]] of 1948, was signed by [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]], allowing women to serve in the armed forces in fully integrated units during peacetime, with only the WAC remaining a separate female unit. The WAC as a branch was disbanded in 1978. Women serving as WACs at that time converted in branch to whichever [[Military Occupational Specialty]] they worked in.

U.S. servicewomen who had joined the Reserves following World War II were involuntarily recalled to active duty during the [[Korean War]]. More than 500 Army nurses served in the combat zone and many more were assigned to large hospitals in Japan during the war. One Army nurse (Major Genevieve Smith) died in a plane crash en route to Korea on July 27, 1950, shortly after hostilities begin. Navy nurses served on hospital ships in the Korean theater of war as well as at Navy hospitals stateside. Eleven Navy nurses died en route to Korea when their plane crashed in the Marshall Islands. Air Force nurses served stateside, in Japan, and as flight nurses in the Korean theater during the conflict. Three Air Force nurses were killed in plane crashes while on duty. Many other servicewomen were assigned to duty in the theater of operations in Japan and Okinawa.&lt;ref name="womensmemorial.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html|title=Highlights in the History of Military Women|website=Women In Military Service For America Memorial|accessdate=June 22, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HZVJCcKl?url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html|archivedate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=scZN59DXeOwC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;lpg=PA204&amp;dq=%22genevieve+smith%22+%22korean+war%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22genevieve%20smith%22%20%22korean%20war%22&amp;f=false |title=Historical Dictionary of the Korean War |author=Paul M.

Records regarding American women serving in the [[Vietnam War]] are vague. However, it is recorded that 600 women served in the country as part of the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], along with 500 members of the WAC, and over 6,000 medical personnel and support staff.

''[[Frontiero v. Richardson]]'', {{ussc|411|677|1973}}, was a [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark]] [[United States Supreme Court]] case&lt;ref&gt;Technically, the case was decided under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s [[Due Process Clause]], not under the Equal Protection Clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], since the latter applies not to the federal government but to the states. However, because ''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]'', through the doctrine of reverse [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporation]], made the standards of the Equal Protection Clause applicable to the federal government, it was for practical purposes an addition not to due process, but rather to equal protection jurisprudence.&lt;/ref&gt; which decided that benefits given by the United States military to the family of service members cannot be given out differently because of sex.

In 1974, the first six women aviators earned their wings as [[United States Navy|Navy]] pilots. The [[United States Congress|Congressionally]] mandated prohibition on women in combat places limitations on the pilots' advancement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Navy Woman Decries Limitations |agency=[[Associated Press]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19840823&amp;id=kdgTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iwYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6981,4703933 |work=[[Star-Banner|Ocala Star-Banner]] |date=August 23, 1984 |at=vol. 40, no. 537, p. 8C|accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but at least two retired as captains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Woman Aviator Pioneer Retires |editor-first=E.

On December 20, 1989, Captain Linda L. Bray, 29, became the first woman to command American soldiers in battle, during the [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]]. She was assigned to lead a force of 30 men and women [[military police]] officers to capture a kennel holding guard dogs that was defended by elements of the [[Panamanian Public Forces|Panamanian Defense Forces]].

The 1991 [[Persian Gulf War]] proved to be the pivotal time for the role of women in the United States Armed Forces to come to the attention of the world media. Over 40,000 women served in almost every role the armed forces had to offer. However, while many came under fire, they were not permitted to participate in deliberate ground engagements. Despite this, there are many reports of women engaging enemy forces during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://userpages.aug.com/captbarb/femvetsds.html |title=Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm |last1=Wilson |first1=Barbara A |publisher=American Women in Uniform, Veterans Too! |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case ''[[United States v.
