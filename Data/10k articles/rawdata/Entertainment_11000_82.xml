{{nihongo|'''''Adventures of Lolo 3'''''|アドベンチャーズオブロロ2|Adobenchāzu obu Roro Tsū|lead=yes}} is a [[puzzle video game]] released in 1991 by [[HAL Laboratory, Inc.|HAL Corporation]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It is based on the Japanese [[Eggerland (series)|Eggerland]] video game series.  It was the third and final installment of the Adventures of Lolo series released in the [[United States|U.S.]]  New gameplay elements were added to make the base gameplay deeper than before.  However, in 1994, a game titled "Adventures of Lolo" was released for Game Boy in Europe (and Japan).  Said Game Boy release was not the same game as the original NES release of the same name, but rather a fourth sequel in the series with continued additions to the base gameplay.

In [[Japan]], this game was released as ''The Adventures of Lolo 2'' because [[Adventures of Lolo]] was not released in Japan.  Additionally, the Japanese version of the game had a different difficulty curve, different stages, and ''Moby'' (the whale-like creature) appeared in Level 9 instead of Level 11.

==Synopsis==
Lolo and Lala are enjoying some time together when the Great King of Eggerland's son and heir throws a potion on all of Lolo and Lala's friends, turning them to stone. Lolo and Lala return home to see the damage that the Great king's son and heir has done and embark on a quest to stop him and return their friends to normal.

==Game information==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}
The player has the ability to select between playing as Lolo or Lala in the levels.  Neither character has any advantage over the other, however, the only difference being in the tutorial levels.

Two changes to the gameplay included the crumbling [[bridge]], which is a bridge that can only be crossed two times before it crumbles into nothingness.  The other change was a new monster called Moby.  Mobies only appear in the underwater levels and use a line of sight attack that sucks Lolo in towards them.  Though not directly a fatal attack, it can cause Lolo to get stuck and have to restart the room.

When pressing select to give up, Lolo does not actually die this time.  Instead, a short "give up" tune plays and the level restarts.  Pressing Start will return the player to the overworld map.  Pressing start again reveals the password to that point in the game.  Adventures of Lolo 3 uses 16-character passwords instead of four-character ones.

The game features a total of 17 levels with 100 different puzzle rooms, nine boss rooms, and ten training rooms.  Levels 3, 13, and 17 have ten rooms each.  The other levels only have five rooms.  Levels 4-7, 9-12, and 17 have a boss at the end.  The two big trees on the overworld map are where the training rooms are, each tree having five rooms each.

==Reception==
Reception to Adventures of Lolo 3 is universally positive.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Dylan Cornelius of Questicle wrote that Adventures of Lolo 3 is "worth every penny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cornelius, Dylan |url=https://questicle.net/22-adventures-of-lolo-3/ |title=The Quest to Review Every NES Game, Adventures of Lolo 3 |date=January 18, 2011 |accessdate=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee Evans of Downwards Compatible wrote, "If you like puzzlers, the Lolo series is a ton of fun, and Adventures of Lolo 3 is a standout."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Evans, Lee | url=http://www.downwardscompatible.com/2012/12/nes-replay-adventures-of-lolo-3.html | title=NES Replay: Adventures of Lolo 3 | date=December 10, 2012 | accessdate=December 12, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223104041/http://www.downwardscompatible.com/2012/12/nes-replay-adventures-of-lolo-3.html | archivedate=December 23, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the game an A,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/1991/07/26/adventures-lolo-3/|title=The Adventures of Lolo 3|work=EW.com|access-date=2018-11-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later picked the game as the #10 greatest game available in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/1991/11/22/video-games-guide/|title=Video Games Guide|work=EW.com|access-date=2018-11-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ebony Bones backup performer.jpg|thumb|One of the Wives, the backing vocalists for English singer [[Ebony Bones]]]]
'''Backing vocalists''' (British English) or '''backup singers''' (American English) are [[singer]]s who provide [[vocal harmony]] with the [[lead vocalist]] or other backing vocalists. In some cases, a backing vocalist may sing alone as a lead-in to the main vocalist's entry or to sing a [[counter-melody]]. Backing vocalists are used in a broad range of [[popular music]], [[traditional music]] and [[world music]] styles.

Solo artists may employ professional backing vocalists in studio recording sessions as well as during concerts. In many [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] bands (e.g., the [[power trio]]), the musicians doing backing vocals also play instruments, such as guitar, electric bass, drums, or keyboards. In [[Music of Latin America|Latin]] or [[Afro-Cuban]] groups, backing singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while singing. In some pop and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] groups and in [[musical theater]], the backing singers may be required to perform elaborately choreographed dance routines while they sing through headset microphones.

The style of singing used by backing singers varies according to the type of song and the genre of music the band plays. In pop and country songs, backing vocalists may perform vocal harmony parts to support the lead vocalist. In hardcore punk or rockabilly, other band members who play instruments may sing or shout backing vocals during the chorus (refrain) section of the songs.

==Terminology==
Alternative terms for backing vocalists include ''backing singers'', ''backing vocals'', ''additional vocals'' or, particularly in the United States and Canada, ''backup singers'' or sometimes ''background singers'' or ''harmony vocalists''.

==Examples==
While some bands use performers whose sole on-stage role is performing backing vocals, it is common for backing singers to have other roles. Two notable examples of band members who sang back-up are [[The Beach Boys]] and [[The Beatles]]. The Beach Boys were well known for their close vocal harmonies, occasionally with all five members singing at once such as "[[In My Room]]" and "[[Surfer Girl (song)|Surfer Girl]]". All five members would sing lead, although most often [[Brian Wilson]] or [[Mike Love]] would sing lead with guitarists [[Carl Wilson]] and [[Al Jardine]] and drummer [[Dennis Wilson]] singing background harmonies. 

The Beatles were also known for their close style of vocal harmonies{{opinion|date=September 2011}} – all Beatles members sang both lead and backing vocals at some point, especially [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]], who frequently supported each other with harmonies, often with fellow Beatle [[George Harrison]] joining in. [[Ringo Starr]], while not as prominent in the role of backing singer as his three bandmates due to his distinctive voice, can be heard singing backing vocals in such tracks as "[[The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill]]" and "[[Carry That Weight]]".  Examples of three-part harmonies by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison include "[[Nowhere Man (song)|Nowhere Man]]", "[[Because (The Beatles song)|Because]]", "[[Day Tripper]]", and "[[This Boy]]".
The members of [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]] and [[Bee Gees]] all each wrote songs and sang back-up or lead vocals and played various instruments on their albums and various collaborations with each other.

Former [[guitarist]] [[John Frusciante]] and current guitarist [[Josh Klinghoffer]] of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] sing nearly all backing vocals (few songs were recorded without backing vocals), often singing some parts without accompaniment from lead vocalist [[Anthony Kiedis]]. The band's bassist [[Michael Balzary|Flea]] occasionally filled in for additional vocals. Frusciante usually sang one song by himself during concerts. Another example is "No Frontiers" by [[The Corrs]], which is sung by Sharon and Caroline.

Other backing vocalists include [[Sebastien Lefebvre]] ([[rhythm guitarist]] at the same time) and [[David Desrosiers]] ([[Bass guitarist]], also at the same time ) for [[pop punk]] band [[Simple Plan]], [[John Petrucci]] of [[Dream Theater]], and guitarists [[Zacky Vengeance]] and [[Synyster Gates]] of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Avenged Sevenfold]].

==Lead singers who record backing vocals==
In the recording studio, some lead singers record their own backing vocals by [[overdubbing]] with a [[multitrack recording]] system. A multitrack recording system enables the [[record producer]] to add many layers of recordings over top of each other. Using a multitrack system, a lead vocalist can record his or her own backing vocals, and then record the lead vocal part over top. Some lead vocalists prefer this approach because the sound of their own harmonies will blend well with their main vocal. 

One famous example is [[Freddie Mercury]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] singing the first part of "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" himself by overdubbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McAlpine|first1=Fraser|title=10 Things You May Not Know About Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody'|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2015/10/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-queens-bohemian-rhapsody|publisher=[[BBC America]]|accessdate=16 May 2017|date=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Stump]] of [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Wednesday 13]], in his own band, and as the lead and backing vocalist of [[Murderdolls]], [[Ian Gillan]] of [[Deep Purple]], [[Simon Le Bon]] of [[Duran Duran]] and [[Brad Delp]] of [[Boston (band)|Boston]] also recorded lead and backing vocals for their albums.

With the exception of a few songs on each album, [[Dan Fogelberg]], [[Eddie Rabbitt]], [[David Bowie]] and [[Richard Marx]] sing all of the background vocals for their songs. [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] of [[the Cure]] not only sings his own backing vocals in the studio, but also doesn't perform with backing vocalists when playing live.

==Different approaches==
Many [[metalcore]] and some [[post-hardcore]] bands, such as [[As I Lay Dying (band)|As I Lay Dying]], [[Alexisonfire]], [[Haste the Day]] and [[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]] feature a main vocalist who performs using [[harsh vocals]], whilst the backing vocalist sings harmonies ([[clean vocals]]) during choruses to create a contrast. Some bands, such as [[Hawthorne Heights]] and [[Finch (American band)|Finch]] have the backing singers do harsh vocals to highlight specific lyrics.

[[Pop music|Pop]] and [[R&amp;B]] vocalists such as [[Diana Ross]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Beyoncé Knowles]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Faith Evans]], [[D'Angelo]], [[Mary J. Blige]] and [[Amerie]] have become known specifically for not only recording their own backing vocals, but for arranging their own multi-tracked vocals and even developing highly complex harmonies and arrangements.  When they perform live, they may have backing vocalists who impersonate their voices.

==Unusual backing vocal styles==
Some bands use backing vocals in order to contrast with the lead singer who may be performing an unusual vocal technique. For example, [[Brian "Head" Welch]], the [[lead guitarist]] of the band [[Korn]], performed backing vocals on several songs, and notably on the song "[[Ball Tongue]]", he screams the chorus while lead vocalist [[Jonathan Davis]] sings incomprehensible [[scat singing|scat vocals]]. Similarly, the Canadian [[deathcore]] group [[Despised Icon]] uses two vocalists, one performing screams and another performing low, growling [[death grunt]]s who alternate, and sometimes sing in unison to highlight certain lyrics. In [[rap music]], a background rapper who chants and rhymes to support the main artist is often referred to as [[hype man]].

==Career paths==
Working as a backing singer can give a vocalist the onstage experience and vocal training they need to develop into a lead vocalist. A number of lead vocalists such as [[Ace Frehley]], [[Richard Marx]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Cher]], [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Trisha Yearwood]], [[Dave Grohl]], [[Jerry Only]], [[Jerry Cantrell]], [[Jason Newsted]], [[Dee Dee Ramone]] and [[Elton John]], learned their craft as backing singers, or singing backing vocals as part of a choir.{{fact|date=May 2013}}&lt;!-- These unsourced lists can be a real source of Hoaxing on WP...people just add in names for fun --&gt;

'''''Black Hole''''' is a [[shoot 'em up]] [[video game]] by DufGames. The game was originally released on 2016 at the [[OUYA]] and ForgeTV and was later ported and enhanced for the Nintendo Switch. The game has released in NA, EU and AUS regions on Nintendo Switch in February 6, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ouya.tv/game/Black-Hole/''Black Hole - OUYA game info page'']&lt;/ref&gt; with the announcement of the Nintendo Switch the team decided to port and enhance the game for the new console.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/black-hole-switch/''Black Hole for Nintendo Switch - Nintendo Game Details'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dufgames.com/''Dufgames - Nintendo Game Details''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Black Hole vg screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|In a top-down view the player must dodge and destroy enemies while collecting pickups they drop.]]
''Black Hole'' is a twin-stick shooter in space where the player flies through different black holes in a top-down view and fights numerous enemies located inside the black hole. Choosing one of the ships the player starts off with very little weapon power. Through pickups that the enemies drop the ship can be upgraded between each completed level to enhance the primary weapon, unlock a secondary weapon and other various ship upgrades. At the end of each black hole after several levels there is a boss fight.&lt;ref name = Neocrisis&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neocrisis.com/news/10029-black-hole-review|title= Neocrisis|language=en|date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
The game consists of 40 levels across 4 themed black holes or worlds. There are 4 different worlds, mechanical, fire, ice, and beast. The player may choose one of three possible spaceships which can be upgraded in between each level. The game contains 3 difficulty levels and features time and score leaderboards for each of them. Multiple achievements can be unlocked which don't have any influence on the game. In the enhanced Nintendo Switch version a [[Color blindness|colorblind]] mode and [[speedrun]] mode was added, which changed the differently colored pickups into more readable letters.

The game also integrates [[HD Rumble]], a fully playable touchscreen mode, and also the possibility to play with motion controls or the IR camera, both of which are not meant as a main was of input but more of a fun way to play the game.&lt;ref name = Neocrisis/&gt;

== Reception ==
The early reviews state that, while not bringing much new to the [[Shoot 'em up]] genre, it is still a solid single player game that fits well on the [[Nintendo Switch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/black_hole|title=Review from Nintendolife|language=en|date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Neocrisis/&gt;

'''Bullen's Animal World''' was a circus style theme park located at [[Wallacia, New South Wales|Wallacia]] on the outskirts of Sydney.  Its address was 11 Park Road, Wallacia.  An equivalent one also existed at Wanneroo, Perth, Western Australia.

==Background==
It was opened in 1969 by [[Stafford Bullen]], the son of circus founder [[Alfred Percival Bullen]], and operated until 1985.  Its closure was to foreshadow the closure of Bullen's other nearby venture, the [[African Lion Safari (Warragamba)|African Lion Safari]], in 1991.

[[File:Dutch Guiana-Suriname-1 Guilder (1801) card money.jpg|thumb|x220px|Card money worth one [[Dutch guilder|guilder]], from [[Dutch Suriname|Dutch Guiana]] (1801)]]
'''Card money''' is a type of [[fiat money]] printed on plain cardboard or [[playing card]]s, which was used at times as [[currency]] in several colonies and countries (including [[Dutch Suriname|Dutch Guiana]], [[New France]], and [[France]]) from the 17th century to the early 19th century. Where introduced, it was often followed by high rates of [[inflation]].

==Design and use==
In order to prepare [[playing card]]s or plain cardboard for use as currency, the medium had to be given a denomination, a seal, a serial number, and appropriate signatures.{{sfn|Shafer 2012, Surinam}} In [[New France]], this meant an embossed [[fleur-de-lis]] and the signatures of the [[Intendant of New France|intendant]], [[Governor of New France|governor]], and treasurer.{{sfn|Deblon 2012, Money Games}} In [[Dutch Suriname|Dutch Guiana]], meanwhile, the form these validations took varied between issue.{{sfn|Tori, Wan Bigi Karta}}

Card money was generally issued, at least initially, in emergency situations.{{sfn|Deblon 2012, Money Games}} It could be backed by other currencies, such as [[Bills of Exchange]], or be without guarantee.{{sfn|Shafer 2012, Surinam}}{{sfn|Deblon 2012, Money Games}}

==Applications==

===New France===
{{main article|Card money in New France}}

====Canada====
[[File:New France (French Canada)-Card Money-12 livres (S107, c. 1735).jpg|left|thumb|A twelve-[[French livre|livre]] card from [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], [[New France]], c. 1735]]
During the expansion of the French colony in [[New France]] (in what is now Canada) in the 17th century, currency used had to be imported from France. When the colony faced [[insolvency]] owing to great expenses fighting the [[Iroquois]] and a diminishing [[beaver]] trade,{{Sfn|Bank of Canada|1966|p=6}} intendant [[Jacques de Meulles]] introduced card money to pay soldiers;{{sfn|McLachlan|1911|p=2}} this soon spread into general use, including commerce.{{Sfn|Bank of Canada|1966|p=7}}{{sfn|Deblon 2012, Money Games}} The introduction of card money allowed the colony to reduce deliveries of [[Coin|specie]], which could be lost at sea to weather or attack;{{Sfn|Bank of Canada|1966|p=8}} no specie could be produced locally owing to a lack of precious metals.{{Sfn|Allen|2009|p=314}} The currency caught on, and values equal to 100 [[French livre|''livres'']] are recorded. Eventually, an estimated two million ''livres'' in card money is thought to have circulated.{{sfn|Deblon 2012, Money Games}}

By the end of the decade New France faced [[counterfeiting]] problems with this currency, although counterfeiters could be [[caning|caned]], [[Human branding|branded]], [[banishment|banished]], [[flogging|flogged]], or even [[hanging|hanged]].{{Sfn|Pritchard|2004|p=253}}{{sfn|Lester|1964|p=12}} It was ultimately inflation, however, which led to the decline of card money in French Canada: the money was produced in a greater quantity than required, in part to offset a failing French economy, while coins were hoarded. Attempts to decrease the value of the cards by half failed, and in 1717 the card money was withdrawn.{{Sfn|Bank of Canada|1966|pp=6–8}} By 1720 it had been declared worthless.{{Sfn|Allen|2009|p=314}}

The recall of card money led to more than a decade of stagnancy, as there was no circulating currency. For this reason, in 1730 the government reinstated card money, reaching a total value of 600,000 ''livres'' by 1733. Unlike the earlier issues of card money, however, these were printed on plain cards, rather than playing cards. In 1763, after another burst of inflation brought on by a turbulent war-time economy, card money was ultimately and permanently withdrawn from the settlement.{{Sfn|Allen|2009|p=314}}{{sfn|Clark|1970|p=113}}

====French Louisiana====
[[File:Monnaie de Cartes (colonie de Louisiane).jpg|thumb|Card money (French Louisiana colony)]]
Between 1716 and 1720, [[John Law (economist)|John Law]] and his privately held (French government backed) Banque Royale issued paper currency in colonial [[French Louisiana]] far in excess of the reserve set aside to back these issues. When investors attempted to redeem notes for specie, the bank stopped payment. The "Mississippi Bubble" began to burst in May 1720, when Banque Royale notes were depreciated by 50% followed by a financial crisis in France.{{sfn|Newman|2008|p=157}} For nearly 18 months there was no official circulating currency. The [[Mississippi Company|Company of the Indies]] ran storehouses for employees. The purchase of goods required vouchers which circulated as a makeshift currency.{{sfn|Newman|2008|p=159}} The company began issuing card money in January 1722{{sfn|Miller Surrey|1916|p=119}} with two authorizing signatures{{sfn|Newman|2008|p=159}} of company directors in France or local officers in Louisiana.{{sfn|Gayarre|1854|p=282}} Denominations ranged from 5 sous to 50 livres, in different shapes to be easily distinguished by non-French speaking and illiterate population.{{sfn|Newman|2008|p=159}} With the introduction of the company card money also came severe inflation.{{sfn|Gayarre|1854|p=467}} By 1725 both the company vouchers and cards had been redeemed.{{sfn|Newman|2008|p=159}}

In the early 1730s, again faced with a shortage of specie and letters of exchange, the [[Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux, Count of Maurepas|Count of Maurepas]] recommended applying a card money system, similar to the one then in use in Canada, in [[French Louisiana]]. This was intended for domestic trade, without any mark-up, and to be backed through letters of exchange.{{sfn|Clark|1970|p=113}} On 14 September 1735, the French Crown approved an issue of card money up to 200,000 livres, with a quota of 150,000 livres for letters of exchange.{{Sfn|Miller Surrey|1916|p=126}} Cards were prepared and signed by the Crown's comptroller in Louisiana, with higher denominations requiring the countersignatures of the governor and ''[[ordonnateur]]''.{{Sfn|Miller Surrey|1916|p=126}} For the next two years the value of the card money remained stable, sustained by ''ordonnateur'' Edmé Gatien Salmon's issuance of letters of exchange in excess of the quota.{{sfn|Clark|1970|p=114}} By 1739, however, value of the card money had decreased, as attempts to redeem the cards for letters of exchange went unfilled. The colony was incurring great expenses during their war with the [[Chickasaw]], and&amp;nbsp;– with the French government unwilling to increase the quota for letters of exchange&amp;nbsp;– by 1741 Salmon was already drawing on his quota for 1744. This shortage, and resulting inflation, meant that by 1743 the card money was essentially worthless.{{sfn|Clark|1970|pp=114–115}} In 1745, with war still ongoing, the card money and other paper issued by the colony was burned; before liquidization, notes were exchanged for letters of exchange at two fifths of face value.{{sfn|Clark|1970|p=117}}

A 1758 request by ''ordonnateur'' [[Vincent de Rochemore]], that card money again be issued, went ignored.{{sfn|Clark|1970|p=124}} Some of the Louisiana card money remained extant into the 1760s.{{sfn|Clark|1970|p=98}} However, none of the several thousand government notes issued are known to have survived until the present.{{sfn|Wigington|1984|p=4}} There are likewise no known surviving examples of Company of the Indies issues.{{sfn|Newman|2008|p=159}}

====Illinois Country====
By the 1740s the administrators of [[Fort de Chartres]], in the [[Illinois Country]], were using card money to pay their troops; the [[Numismatics|numismatist]] Harry Wigington suggests that the currency was introduced by administrators who had experience with similar notes in Canada or New Orleans. Known as ''Solde de Troupe'' notes, this card money did not have official government backing. Rather, it was authorized by the fort's commanders and applied by the guardians of its warehouse. These notes were discontinued when the British&amp;nbsp;– who, by law, had to pay their soldiers in specie&amp;nbsp;– assumed control of the fort in 1763.{{sfn|Wigington|1984|pp=3–5}} However, owing to continued French cultural and social influence, circulation and issuance of these notes continued into the mid-1760s.{{sfn|Wigington|1984|p=9}}

===Dutch Guiana===
Card money was first used in [[Dutch Suriname|Dutch Guiana]], now [[Suriname]], in 1761. Issues could be on plain cards or playing cards, and were at first cut into circles approximately {{convert|38|mm}} in diameter, resembling coins. Later card money was rectangular, in order to save on labor, although some issues continued to be round or even hexagonal.{{sfn|Shafer 2012, Surinam}}{{Sfn|Cuhaj|2012|p=1122}} Initial issues were in the value of 1, 2.5, and 10 [[Dutch guilder|guilders]],{{sfn|Deblon 2012, Money Games}} later followed by issues of 0.5, 5, and 100 guilders.{{sfn|Tori, Wan Bigi Karta}} The cards, which had no intrinsic value, were initially backed by bills of exchange from the Netherlands but later released unsecured.{{sfn|Shafer 2012, Surinam}}{{sfn|Tori, Wan Bigi Karta}}

The card currency produced in Guiana soon outpaced demand, such that [[inflation]] became an issue, and although the cards ostensibly traded at 3 card guilders to 2.50 guilders from the Netherlands, the value began fluctuating greatly. However, the colony's residents continued to use card money, and when Guiana was controlled by the British in the early 19th century, they also produced this money, fearing a deficit. The Dutch regained control of Guiana in 1816, and the card money continued. In 1826, the Dutch colonial government formally introduced paper currency,{{Sfn|Cuhaj|2012|p=1122}} similar to Dutch banknotes but with the word ''Suriname'' [[overprint]]ed on the bills. The colony's card money was not formally abolished until two years later.{{sfn|Shafer 2012, Surinam}}{{sfn|Deblon 2012, Money Games}}{{sfn|Tori, Wan Bigi Karta}}

In his 1997 book ''Surinam Paper Currency'', Theo van Elmpt records a total of 94 issues of card money in the country,{{sfn|Shafer 2012, Surinam}} and the [[Central Bank of Suriname]] estimates that the total face value of the cards issued was between five and ten million guilders.{{sfn|Tori, Wan Bigi Karta}} However, few specimens survive.{{sfn|Shafer 2012, Surinam}} In the oral tradition of the Suriname [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]], the term ''Wan Bigi Karta'' ("a big card") continued to refer to the sum of 3.20 guilders as late as 1900.{{sfn|Deblon 2012, Money Games}}{{sfn|Tori, Wan Bigi Karta}}

===France===

During the [[French Revolution]], ''billets de confiance'' ("bills of trust") were issued on card money and similar paper by employers or similar authorities. An estimated 5500 different ''billets'' were issued from approximately 1500 [[communes of France|communes]] between 1790 and 1793.{{Sfn|Taws|2013|p=14}} They were generally printed on cards or coloured paper, and signed by the bearer or issuing authority. This money was generally oriented horizontally, and decorations could include revolutionary symbolism (such as a [[Phrygian cap#Revolutionary icon|liberty cap]] or [[fasces]]), patriotic slogans, the name of commune where a ''billet'' was issued, or an ornate border.{{Sfn|Taws|2013|p=14}}

These ''billets de confiance'' bore no guarantee, but could be exchanged for ''[[assignat]]s'', a type of paper currency introduced by the revolutionary government of which there was a shortage.{{sfn|Deblon 2012, Money Games}}{{Sfn|Taws|2013|p=69}} However, issuing authorities were not required to keep enough ''assignats'' on hand to redeem all the card money they issued; the Paris-based Maison de Secours ran up a deficit of 2 million [[livres]] by issuing more ''billets de confiance'' than they held in ''assignats''.{{sfn|Aftalion|1990|pp=97, 123}} The ''billets'' faced heavy counterfeiting, which resulted in the issuing authorities making more complex designs.{{Sfn|Taws|2013|pp=14–15}} In February 1792 tax collectors stopped accepting payments in ''billets de confiance''; economist {{Interlanguage link multi|Florin Aftalion|fr}} suggests that this may have been due to concerns over counterfeiting.{{sfn|Aftalion|1990|p=98}} Ultimately, in mid-1793 the issuing of card money was stopped.{{sfn|Aftalion|1990|p=98}}

==Evaluation==
Veronique Deblon, writing for the [[National Bank of Belgium]], notes that all issues of card money "could not be called unqualified success[es]", as they were capable of solving budget deficits but eventually were overproduced, leading to inflation.{{sfn|Deblon 2012, Money Games}} The numismatist Neil Shafer concurs, noting that the card money of Guiana "served its purpose" in spite of the devaluation.{{sfn|Shafer 2012, Surinam}} In his article on the card money in French Canada, Larry Allen described it as "show[ing] the flexibility, adaptability, and inventiveness of an expanding economic system", despite "seem[ing]&amp;nbsp;... far-fetched".{{Sfn|Allen|2009|p=314}}

[[File:Disaster tourism merapi.jpg|thumb|Disaster tourism at [[Mount Merapi]], after the [[2010 eruptions of Mount Merapi|2010 eruptions]]]]
'''Disaster tourism''' has been defined as the practice of visiting locations at which an environmental disaster, either natural or man-made, has occurred. Although a variety of disasters are the subject of subsequent disaster tourism, the most common disaster tourist sites are the areas surrounding volcanic eruptions. Opinions on the morality and impact of disaster tourism are divided. Advocates of disaster tourism often claim that the practice raises awareness of the event, stimulates the local economy, and educates the public about the local culture, while critics claim that the practice is exploitative, profits on loss, and often mischaracterizes the events in question.

==Motivations of disaster tourists==
{{essay-like|section|date=August 2015}}
There are many reasons that people come to visit disaster sites. Some tourists may have personal connections to the tragedy as survivors, relatives of victims, or witnesses while other visitors have an intellectual or cultural interest, wanting to understand what happened or connect the tragedy to other cultural events. This latter group typically comprises educators, historians, academics and students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smartertravel.com/2017/06/19/disaster-tourism-tragedy-draws-tourists/|title=Disaster Tourism: Why Tragedy Draws Tourists - SmarterTravel|date=2017-06-19|work=SmarterTravel|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another population of visitors hope to aid in providing relief to the affected areas—some directly through volunteer work and some indirectly through donations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cidi.org/disaster-tourism/|title=Disaster Tourism {{!}} USAID CIDI is an education organization that is focused on effective public donations in support of disaster relief.|website=www.cidi.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other visitors have no connection to the site or the event, but happen to be there as tourists and visit those places as part of their sightseeing. A common example of this is tourists who come to Italy to sightsee in Rome and end up visiting Pompeii and its neighboring cities without initially intending to do so.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Reception of disaster tourism ==
Disaster tourism had a mixed reception, with critics labelling it as voyeuristic and profiting off of loss and with advocates arguing that the tourism stimulates the recovering economy and brings awareness to local culture. Although the public perception of tourism depends on a wide variety of factors, such whether the disaster was man-made or natural and how long it has been since incident, there are some general trends in the reception of tourism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geckosadventures.com/tales/disaster-tourism/|title=Understanding disaster tourism: Is it ever okay?|date=2015-06-19|work=Geckos Tales|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.women-on-the-road.com/disaster-tourism.html|title=Why Indulging in Disaster Tourism Could Be a Tragic Mistake|work=Women on the Road|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the site or tour, disaster tourism can be seen to be an educational experience or exploitative. Whether or not a tourist site is handled in a respectful and tactful manner often is determined both by those organizing the events and the tourists themselves. Moreover, advocates of disaster tourism point out that attractions are capable of re-examining disasters in an educational manner despite that the operators are motivated by profit. Many of these advocates argue that when distasteful disaster tourism occurs, the blame lies primarily on the tourists for providing an insensitive demand rather on the operators for fulfilling such a demand.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/feb/22/news/la-trb-ethics-of-disaster-tourism-20120221|title=The ethics of disaster tourism: What is the right thing to do? [Updated]|last=Hamm|first=Catharine M.|date=2012-02-22|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; For both tourists and operators, however, parsing the difference between an educational and an exploitative one requires asking what areas are crucial for understanding the disaster and clarifying how behavior that is appropriate in a destroyed area is often different from behavior that is appropriate in newly built homes or temporary camps.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The effect of tourism on the local economy is often nuanced due to the specifics in how tourism affects local income. It is generally accepted that if the tours comprise public events organized by volunteers, then there are consistent but small increases to charity donations. However, if the tours are organized by private companies, then it is not always clear how what proportion of the profits go back into relief efforts. Furthermore, while governmental regulation typically prevents private tours from slowing down or reversing reconstruction in areas where reconstruction has already began, critics argue that private touring may deincentivize the reconstruction of locations and sites, in which reconstruction has yet to occur.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another possible situation is that the tours are not organized by formal entities but instead by less cohesive groups of citizens. These cases are relatively unstudied due to their rarity.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/disaster-tourism-in-indonesia/a-6479972|title=Disaster tourism in Indonesia {{!}} DW {{!}} 04.04.2011|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, visiting disaster sites is thought to have an effect on empathy, but the nature of the effect it has depends on the particulars of the visit. Unorganized visits, for example, can often raise empathy by forcing the visitors to see suffering up close and prompting them to consider how to interact with victims. More organized visits, on the other hand, have been accused of lowering empathy because they compromised tourists “acting like tourists and dressing like tourists,” which dilutes and sanitizes the experience.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Virtual reality in disaster tourism ==

=== Facebook's virtual tour of Puerto Rico ===
In September 2017, Hurricane Maria devastated the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Hurricane Maria is estimated to caused 4,645 deaths total, and in Puerto Rico, it is estimated to have caused $94 billion in property damage and displaced approximately 60,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/harvard-study-estimates-thousands-died-in-puerto-rico-due-to-hurricane-maria/2018/05/29/1a82503a-6070-11e8-a4a4-c070ef53f315_story.html|title=Harvard study estimates thousands died in Puerto Rico because of Hurricane Maria|last=Hernández|first=Arelis R.|date=2018-05-29|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-06-09|last2=McGinley|first2=Laurie|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/puerto-rico-united-states-america/quick-facts-hurricane-marias-effect-puerto-rico|title=Quick Facts: Hurricane Maria's Effect on Puerto Rico|work=ReliefWeb|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 2017, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook social VR chief Rachel Franklin used a livestream to showcase Facebook’s new VR app, Facebook Spaces, by taking a virtual tour of the devastated areas Puerto Rico. During the 10 minute video, Zuckerberg explains how Facebook partnered with Red Cross to build population map from satellite imagery and better allocate the relief effort.

The public reception to the tour was unanimously negative. Zuckerberg drew criticism for describing VR as "magical" in its ability to transport people to disaster zones, and most viewers considered the cartoon avatars of Zuckerberg and Franklin to be an inappropriately jovial tone. The day following the livestream, Zuckerberg apologized, explaining, "When you're in VR yourself, the surroundings feel quite real. But that sense of empathy doesn't extend well to people watching you as a virtual character on a 2D screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/zuckerberg-exploited-disaster-puerto-rico-virtual-reality-stunt-681381|title=Mark Zuckerberg has been accused of "exploiting disaster" for taking part in a Puerto Rico virtual reality stunt|date=2017-10-10|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/10/zuckerberg-apologizes-for-his-tone-deaf-vr-cartoon-tour-of-puerto-rico-devastation/|title=Zuckerberg apologizes for his tone-deaf VR cartoon tour of Puerto Rico devastation – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16450346/zuckerberg-facebook-spaces-puerto-rico-virtual-reality-hurricane|title=A cartoon Mark Zuckerberg toured hurricane-struck Puerto Rico in virtual reality|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/09/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-puerto-rico-virtual-reality|title=Mark Zuckerberg 'tours' flooded Puerto Rico in bizarre virtual reality promo|last=Solon|first=Olivia|date=2017-10-10|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/10/10/mark-zuckerberg-criticised-tasteless-puerto-rico-vr-video/|title=Mark Zuckerberg apologises for 'tasteless' Puerto Rico VR video|last=McGoogan|first=Cara|date=2017-10-10|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of disaster tourism==

=== 79 AD eruption of Mt Vesuvius ===
When the nearby volcano Mt Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, the eruption buried the city of Pompeii and the nearby city of Herculaneum and preserved everything from its streets to its frescoes under mounds of pumice and ash. Although Pompeii was initially rediscovered in 1599, tourism was undesirable until Spanish engineer Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre performed a much larger evacuation in 1748, which revealed many noteworthy structures, such as a fully intact Roman theatre.

Today, Pompeii belongs to the much larger Vesuvius National Park and is one of Italy’s most popular tourist sites, attracting approximately 2.5 million visitors annually.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/g1288/8-disaster-tourism-sites/|title=8 Disaster Tourism Sites|date=2013-08-30|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Hindenburg incident (1937) ===
In the early evening of May 6, 1937, the German passenger airship LZ 129 Hindenburg burst into flame during a docking attempt at the Lakehurst Naval Air Station, just outside Lakehurst, New Jersey. With the cause of the fire unknown and a death toll of thirty-seven passengers, the Hindenburg disaster became one of the biggest news stories of its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.airships.net/hindenburg/disaster/|title=The Hindenburg Disaster {{!}} Airships.net|work=Airships.net|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, a bronze plaque and cement outline the site of the incident. Immediately east of the crash site, volunteers of the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society will conduct public tours of Historic Hangar One, the location where the Hindenburg was kept.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant explosion ===
On the morning of April 26, 1986, the number four reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded, producing airborne radioactive materials and a fire that burned for ten days. The Chernobyl explosion caused dozens of direct deaths and thousands of deaths due to long-term exposure. In the aftermath, 350,000 residents were displaced from Chernobyl and the nearby city of Pripyat. The other three reactors at Chernobyl power plant continued running at the time but were gradually lessened until the power plant’s shutdown in 2000.

The Ukraine-based tour company SoloEast Travel currently runs daylong tours through Chernobyl’s exclusion zone, a thousand square-mile area that includes the plant. The highlights of the tour include visiting Red Forest, a pine tree woodland destroyed by radioactive contamination, exploring Kopachi, a nearby village that was demolished due to high contamination levels, and finally coming within 1000 feet of the remains of the number four reactor. These tours are met with some controversy because despite that SoloEast Travel claims that publicly accessible areas surrounding the power plant contain low levels of radiation and are deemed safe, a number of third party scientists disagree.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== 1989 ''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill ===
In 1989, the ''Exxon Valdez'' oil tanker struck Alaska's Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound and leaked crude oil into the sound. The amount of oil spilled is currently estimated to be over 30 million gallons. Oil from the spill would eventually contaminate more than 11,000 square-miles of ocean and 1300 miles of coastline. The spill killed hundreds of sea otters, harbor seals, and eagles and hundreds of thousands of seabird in the days following the spill. Despite that it is not the world's largest oil spill, the ''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill is typically considered the most notorious in American history.

Having been among the first responders, the family-run Stan Stephens Cruises operates glacier tours out of Prince William Sound that highlight the history surrounding the Exxon Valdez spill and its aftermath.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Hurricane Katrina (2005) ===

In late August 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated the American city of New Orleans. Although 80–90% of the population was evacuated prior, twenty-three breaches in navigational canal levees, drainage canal levees, and floodwalls occurred as a result of Katrina’s storm surge. With these failures, 80% of New Orleans became flooded, which in turn caused over 200,000 homes to be destroyed and 800,000 residents to be displaced. At the time, the disaster had a large impact on the politics, population, and economics for a sizable portion of the United States.

A decade after the incident, the effects of Hurricane Katrina are still visible and catastrophic. Although many companies offer bus tours of the still-damaged regions, critics argues that these tours interfere with the relief effort. Some have suggested that curious tourists should instead go on bike tours in order to restrict the disruption to residents trying to get their lives back on track. Quite frequently, tours will focus on showcasing the culture of specific districts and neighborhood, treating Hurricane Katrina as the most recent event in a much longer cultural history. Many tours donate their profits or a portion of their profits to local relief organizations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2015/08/10_years_after_katrina_new_orl.html|title=10 years after Katrina, New Orleans' tourism industry booming|work=NOLA.com|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010 eruption of Mt Merapi ===
In the November of 2010, the active Indonesian volcano of Mt Merapi had its eruption in a century, which led to direct deaths of 353 people and the displacement of approximately 400,000 people in nearby villages.

Mt Merapi is unique among disaster tourist sites because Merapi was a popular tourist site prior to the volcano’s eruption, and tourism had already made up a significant portion of the local economy. While many tour companies and travel agencies hold more standard sightseeing tours of the affected areas, some programs provide more direct paths to donating to local charities and getting involved in the relief effort. For example, the Go Green Campaign encourages tourists to purchase small trees or seeds and plant them in local villages.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

{{for|the video game player|Doublelift}}
A '''double lift''' is a [[sleight of hand]] maneuver used by [[magic (illusion)|magicians]] in [[card magic]]. It is a method by which the identity of the top [[Playing card|card]] may be kept secret by lifting the top two cards as one, making it seem as if only the top card is picked up. Similar techniques may be applied to more than two cards to perform a triple or even quadruple lift.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://askalexander.org/display/39292/Expert+Card+Technique/29|title=Expert Card Technique: Close-up Table Magic|last=Hugard|first=Jean|author2=Frederick Braue|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|year=1974|isbn=0-486-21755-8|location=|pages=3|chapter=The Secret Lifts|subscription=yes|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Theo Annemann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Vernon|first=Dai|date=March 1980|title=The Vernon Touch|url=|journal=Genii|volume=44|issue=3|pages=25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the card is shown to the audience, the audience is tricked into believing that they are shown the top card in the deck where in fact they are shown the second card. When the cards are displayed, the maneuver is sometimes called the "double turnover".

Some versions of the [[ambitious card]] routine rely almost entirely upon this sleight. In combination with a few other mechanics and good showmanship, entire acts can and have been made out of this single move.{{Original research inline|date=December 2017}}

==Origins==
{{Original research section|date=December 2017}}
The first recorded publishing of the double lift is in Richard Neve's book "The Merry Companion"&lt;ref&gt;Neve, Richard. The Merry Companion. London: Printed for H. Tracy, 1721. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conjuringcredits.com/doku.php?id=cards:double_lift|title=Double Lift|last=|first=|date=|website=Conjuring Credits|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be seen on page 141, item XXV under "to seem to change the top card of the pack into another". The double lift was next seen in print in the 19th century in Jean Nicholas Ponsin&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s ''Nouvelle Magie Blanche Dévoilée''.&lt;ref&gt;Ponsin, J. -N. ''Nouvelle Magie Blanche Dévoilée''. Genève: Slatkine, 1980. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to the double lift in the 20th century is in [[John Northern Hilliard]]'s book "Greater Magic".&lt;ref&gt;Hilliard, John Northern, Carl Waring Jones, Jean Hugard, and Harlan Tarbell. Greater Magic; A Practical Treatise on Modern Magic. Minneapolis: C.W. Jones, Priv. Print. for Professional &amp; Amateur Magicians, 1938. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many confuse the creation of the double lift with the [[Dai Vernon]] double turnover, which is an extension of the double lift where two cards are flipped to hide the identity of the top card. Still, many magicians and magic historians debate that Vernon was the creator, though he never has claimed to be the creator. In an interview in the 1982 small-time film "The Wonder of Magic", Dai Vernon said that he "may be the creator" of the double turnover, but wasn't certain.

'''''Engineering Announcements for the Radio and Television Trade''''', sometimes abbreviated to '''''Engineering Announcements''''', was a weekly magazine of news and information intended for technicians and salespeople in the United Kingdom, produced and transmitted by the [[Independent Television Authority]] (and later the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]]) from 23 November 1970 until 31 July 1990.  It covered technical advances in the industry such as the [[British Satellite Broadcasting|launch of satellite television]] and [[NICAM]] stereo, along with details of new transmitters and the scheduling of transmitter downtime.

''Engineering Announcements'', and the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC's]] similar ''[[Service Information]]'', are examples of regularly scheduled "ghost programmes," so called because they were never advertised in on-air schedules, in newspaper TV listings, the ''[[TV Times]]'' or on [[teletext]].

==Scheduling==
''Engineering Announcements'' was originally scheduled directly after ''[[Monday's Newcomers]]'', another example of a ghost programme which offered the advertising trade the opportunity to watch first runs of new adverts before they aired in prime time on ITV. It was shown at 9:45{{nbsp}}am.

In September 1972, ''Engineering Announcements'' moved to 9:10{{nbsp}}am on Tuesdays, where it remained until May 1983. The launch of [[TV-am]] meant that the ITV network would no longer be available to show ''Engineering Announcements'' at the old time although they were still shown on ITV at 9:17{{nbsp}}am, in the 10-minute gap between the end of TV-am and the start of ITV - the gap was needed to allow for switching ITV from national transmission to the local ITV contractor. This became automated shortly after TV-am's launch and the gap was no longer required. TV-am's hours were extended until 9:25{{nbsp}}am and consequently the slot used to transmit ''Engineering Announcements'' disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYJLr37sm20&amp;nohtml5=False Final Engineering Announcements on ITV]&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that [[Channel 4]] and [[S4C]], still in its infancy, generally didn't start broadcasting until the early evening, the programme was transferred to Channel 4 (except for Wales where it handed over to S4C) and screened at 9:15{{nbsp}}am each Tuesday, with a repeat at 12:15{{nbsp}}pm the same day. However, as Channel 4 and S4C gradually lengthened its broadcasting hours throughout the 1980s, ''Engineering Announcements'' was forced into increasingly earlier time slots, losing first the 12:15{{nbsp}}pm repeat when it took over ITV's programmes for schools and colleges in September 1987. It moved to 8:10{{nbsp}}am at the start of 1989 and when Channel 4 launched its own [[breakfast television]] service in April 1989, ''Engineering Announcements'' was moved to 5:45{{nbsp}}am, where it could be recorded by engineers for later viewing.

''Engineering Announcements'' broadcast for the final time on 31 July 1990. This was a retrospective programme.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Izz-4_AlKWg IBA Engineering Announcements final edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ITV strike from August to October 1979, ''Engineering Announcements'' was the only programme broadcast on most of the network.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30036">In [[economics]], [[game theory]], and [[decision theory]] the '''expected utility hypothesis''', concerning people's preferences with regard to choices that have [[risk (statistics)|uncertain outcomes]] (gambles), states that the [[Subjective theory of value|subjective value]] associated with an individual's gamble is the statistical expectation of that individual's valuations of the outcomes of that gamble, where these valuations may differ from the dollar value of those outcomes.

Initiated by [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1738, this hypothesis has proven useful to explain some popular choices that seem to contradict the [[expected value]] criterion (which takes into account only the sizes of the payouts and the probabilities of occurrence), such as occur in the contexts of gambling and insurance. Until the mid-twentieth century, the standard term for the expected utility was the '''moral expectation''', contrasted with "mathematical expectation" for the expected value.&lt;ref&gt;"Moral expectation", under Jeff Miller, [http://jeff560.tripod.com/m.html Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (M)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511132124/http://jeff560.tripod.com/m.html |date=2011-05-11 }}, accessed 2011-03-24. The term "utility" was first introduced mathematically in this connection by [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]] in 1871; previously the term "moral value" was used.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem]] provides necessary and sufficient conditions under which the expected utility hypothesis holds. From relatively early on, it was accepted that some of these conditions would be violated by real decision-makers in practice but that the conditions could be interpreted nonetheless as '[[axiom]]s' of [[rationality|rational]] [[choice]].

==Formula for expected utility==

When the entity &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; whose value &lt;math&gt; x_i&lt;/math&gt; affects a person’s utility takes on one of a set of [[discrete and continuous variables|discrete values]], the formula for expected utility, which is assumed to be maximized, is

:&lt;math&gt;E[u(x)]=p_1 \cdot u(x_1)+p_2 \cdot u(x_2)+...&lt;/math&gt;

where the left side is the subjective valuation of the gamble as a whole, &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ''i''th possible outcome, &lt;math&gt;u(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; is its valuation, and &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is its probability. There could be either a finite set of possible values &lt;math&gt;x_i,&lt;/math&gt; in which case the right side of this equation has a finite number of terms; or there could be an infinite set of discrete values, in which case the right side has an infinite number of terms.

When &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; can take on any of a continuous range of values, the expected utility is given by

:&lt;math&gt;E[u(x)] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty u(x)f(x)dx,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[probability density function]] of &lt;math&gt;x.&lt;/math&gt;

==Expected value and choice under risk==
In the presence of risky outcomes, a human decision maker does not always choose the option with higher [[expected value]] investments.  For example, suppose there is a choice between a guaranteed payment of $1, and a gamble in which the probability of getting a $100 payment is 1 in 80 and the alternative, far more likely outcome is getting nothing (the expected value is then $1.25); according to expected value theory people should choose the $100-or-nothing gamble, but as stressed by expected utility theory, some people are risk averse enough to prefer the sure thing, even though it has a lower expected value, while other less risk averse people would still choose the riskier, higher-mean gamble.

==Bernoulli's formulation==
[[Nicolas Bernoulli]] described the [[St. Petersburg paradox]] (involving infinite expected values) in 1713, prompting two Swiss mathematicians to develop expected utility theory as a solution.  The theory can also more accurately describe more realistic scenarios (where expected values are finite) than expected value alone. In 1728, [[Gabriel Cramer]], in a letter to Nicolas Bernoulli, wrote, "the mathematicians estimate money in proportion to its quantity, and men of good sense in proportion to the usage that they may make of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cerebro.xu.edu/math/Sources/NBernoulli/correspondence_petersburg_game.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501234331/http://cerebro.xu.edu/math/Sources/NBernoulli/correspondence_petersburg_game.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1738, Nicolas' cousin [[Daniel Bernoulli]], published the canonical 18th Century description of this solution in ''Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis'' or ''Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Bernoulli proposed that a nonlinear function of utility of an outcome should be used instead of the [[expected value]] of an outcome, accounting for [[risk aversion]], where the [[risk premium]] is higher for low-probability events than the difference between the payout level of a particular outcome and its expected value. 

Bernoulli's paper was the first formalization of [[marginal utility]], which has broad application in economics in addition to expected utility theory.  He used this concept to formalize the idea that the same amount of additional money was less useful to an already-wealthy person than it would be to a poor person.

==Infinite expected value—St. Petersburg paradox==
{{Main article|St. Petersburg paradox}}

The [[St. Petersburg paradox]] (named after the journal in which Bernoulli's paper was published) arises when there is no upper bound on the potential rewards from very low probability events.  Because some probability distribution functions have an infinite [[expected value]], an expected-wealth maximizing person would pay an arbitrarily large finite amount to take this gamble.  In real life, people do not do this.

Bernoulli proposed a solution to this paradox in his paper: the utility function used in real life means that the expected utility of the gamble is finite, even if its expected value is infinite. (Thus he hypothesized diminishing [[marginal utility]] of increasingly larger amounts of money.)  It has also been resolved differently by other economists by proposing that very low probability events are neglected, by taking into account the finite resources of the participants, or by noting that one simply cannot buy that which is not sold (and that sellers would not produce a lottery whose expected loss to them were unacceptable).

==Von Neumann–Morgenstern formulation==
{{Main article|Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem}}

===The von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms===
There are [[Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem|four axioms]] of the expected utility theory that define a ''rational'' decision maker. They are completeness, transitivity, independence and continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Neumann |first=John von |last2=Morgenstern |first2=Oskar |title=Theory of Games and Economic Behavior |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |origyear=1944 |edition=Third |year=1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Completeness (order theory)|Completeness]]''' assumes that an individual has well defined preferences and can always decide between any two alternatives.
* Axiom (Completeness): For every A and B either &lt;math&gt;A \succeq B&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;A \preceq B&lt;/math&gt;.
This means that the individual either prefers A to B, or is indifferent between A and B, or prefers B to A.

'''[[Transitive relation|Transitivity]]''' assumes that, as an individual decides according to the completeness axiom, the individual also decides consistently.
* Axiom (Transitivity): For every A, B and C with &lt;math&gt;A \succeq B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; B \succeq C&lt;/math&gt; we must have &lt;math&gt; A \succeq C&lt;/math&gt;.

'''[[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]]''' pertains to well-defined preferences as well.  It assumes that two gambles mixed with an irrelevant third one will maintain the same order of preference as when the two are presented independently of the third one.  The independence axiom is the most controversial axiom.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}.
* Axiom (Independence of irrelevant alternatives): Let A, B, and C be three lotteries with &lt;math&gt;A \succeq  B&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; be the probability that a third choice is present: &lt;math&gt;t \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;;&lt;br /&gt; if &lt;math&gt;tA+(1-t)C \succeq t B+(1-t)C,&lt;/math&gt; then the third choice, C, is irrelevant, and the order of preference for A before B holds, independently of the presence of C.

'''Continuity''' assumes that when there are three lotteries (A, B and C) and the individual prefers A to B and B to C, then there should be a possible combination of A and C in which the individual is then indifferent between this mix and the lottery B.
* Axiom (Continuity): Let A, B and C be lotteries with &lt;math&gt;A \succeq B \succeq C&lt;/math&gt;; then there exists a probability p such that B is equally good as &lt;math&gt;pA+(1-p)C&lt;/math&gt;.

If all these axioms are satisfied, then the individual is said to be rational and the preferences can be represented by a utility function, i.e. one can assign numbers (utilities) to each outcome of the lottery such that choosing the best lottery according to the preference &lt;math&gt;\succeq&lt;/math&gt; amounts to choosing the lottery with the highest expected utility. This result is called the [[Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem|von Neumann–Morgenstern utility representation theorem]].

In other words, if an individual's behavior always satisfies the above axioms, then there is a utility function such that the individual will choose one gamble over another if and only if the expected utility of one exceeds that of the other. The expected utility of any gamble may be expressed as a linear combination of the utilities of the outcomes, with the weights being the respective probabilities. Utility functions are also normally continuous functions. Such utility functions are also referred to as von Neumann–Morgenstern (vNM) utility functions. This is a central theme of the expected utility hypothesis in which an individual chooses not the highest expected value, but rather the highest expected utility. The expected utility maximizing individual makes decisions rationally based on the axioms of the theory.

The von Neumann–Morgenstern formulation is important in the application of [[set theory]] to economics because it was developed shortly after the Hicks–Allen "[[Ordinal utility|ordinal]] revolution" of the 1930s, and it revived the idea of [[cardinal utility]] in economic theory.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} However, while in this context the ''utility function'' is cardinal, in that implied behavior would be altered by a non-linear monotonic transformation of utility, the ''expected utility function'' is ordinal because any monotonic increasing transformation of expected utility gives the same behavior.

===Risk aversion===
{{further information|Risk aversion}}
The expected utility theory takes into account that individuals may be [[Risk aversion|risk-averse]], meaning that the individual would refuse a fair gamble (a fair gamble has an expected value of zero). Risk aversion implies that their utility functions are [[concave function|concave]] and show diminishing marginal wealth utility. The [[risk attitude]] is directly related to the curvature of the utility function: risk neutral individuals have linear utility functions, while risk seeking individuals have convex utility functions and risk averse individuals have concave utility functions.  The degree of risk aversion can be measured by the curvature of the utility function.

Since the risk attitudes are unchanged under [[affine transformation]]s of ''u'', the second derivative ''u'''' is not an adequate measure of  the risk aversion of a utility function. Instead, it needs to be normalized. This leads to the definition of the Arrow–Pratt&lt;ref&gt;Arrow, K.J.,1965, "The theory of risk aversion," in ''Aspects of the Theory of Risk Bearing'', by Yrjo Jahnssonin Saatio, Helsinki.  Reprinted in: ''Essays in the Theory of Risk Bearing'', Markham Publ. Co., Chicago, 1971, 90-109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1913738 |author=Pratt, J. W. |title=Risk aversion in the small and in the large |journal=Econometrica |volume=32 |issue=1/2 |pages=122–136 |date=January–April 1964 |jstor=1913738}}&lt;/ref&gt; measure of absolute risk aversion:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathit{ARA}(w) =-\frac{u''(w)}{u'(w)},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is wealth.

The Arrow–Pratt measure of relative risk aversion is:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathit{RRA}(w) =-\frac{wu''(w)}{u'(w)}&lt;/math&gt;

Special classes of utility functions are the CRRA ([[constant relative risk aversion]]) functions, where RRA(w) is constant, and the CARA ([[constant absolute risk aversion]]) functions, where ARA(w) is constant. They are often used in economics for simplification.

A decision that maximizes expected utility also maximizes the probability of the decision's consequences being preferable to some uncertain threshold (Castagnoli and LiCalzi,1996; Bordley and LiCalzi,2000; Bordley and Kirkwood).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} In the absence of uncertainty about the threshold,  expected utility maximization simplifies to maximizing the probability of achieving some fixed target.  If the uncertainty is uniformly distributed, then expected utility maximization becomes expected value maximization.  Intermediate cases lead to increasing risk aversion above some fixed threshold and increasing risk seeking below a fixed threshold.

===Examples of von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions===
The utility function &lt;math&gt;u(w)=\log(w)&lt;/math&gt; was originally suggested by Bernoulli (see above).  It has relative risk aversion constant and equal to one, and is still sometimes assumed in economic analyses.  The utility function 

:&lt;math&gt; u(w)= -e^{-aw}&lt;/math&gt; 

exhibits constant absolute risk aversion, and for this reason is often avoided, although it has the advantage of offering substantial mathematical tractability when asset returns are normally distributed.  Note that, as per the affine transformation property alluded to above, the utility function &lt;math&gt;K-e^{-aw}&lt;/math&gt; gives exactly the same preferences orderings as does  &lt;math&gt;-e^{-aw}&lt;/math&gt;; thus it is irrelevant that the values of &lt;math&gt;-e^{-aw}&lt;/math&gt; and its expected value are always negative: what matters for preference ordering is which of two gambles gives the higher expected utility, not the numerical values of those expected utilities.

The class of constant relative risk aversion utility functions contains three categories.  Bernoulli's utility function

:&lt;math&gt; u(w) = \log(w)&lt;/math&gt;

has relative risk aversion equal to 1.  The functions

:&lt;math&gt; u(w) = w^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt; have relative risk aversion equal to &lt;math&gt;1-\alpha\in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;.  And the functions

:&lt;math&gt; u(w) = -w^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; have relative risk aversion equal to &lt;math&gt;1-\alpha &gt;1.&lt;/math&gt;

See also [[Risk aversion#Absolute risk aversion|the discussion]] of utility functions having hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA).

===Measuring risk in the expected utility context===
Often people refer to "risk" in the sense of a potentially quantifiable entity.  In the context of [[modern portfolio theory|mean-variance analysis]], [[variance]] is used as a risk measure for portfolio return; however, this is only valid if returns are [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] or otherwise [[elliptical distribution|jointly elliptically distributed]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2296336 |author=Borch, K. |title=A note on uncertainty and indifference curves |journal=Review of Economic Studies |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |date=January 1969 |jstor=2296336 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-0531(83)90129-1 |author=Chamberlain, G. |title=A characterization of the distributions that imply mean-variance utility functions |journal=Journal of Economic Theory |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=185–201 |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2328079 |author1=Owen, J. |author2=Rabinovitch, R. |title=On the class of elliptical distributions and their applications to the theory of portfolio choice |journal=Journal of Finance |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=745–752 |year=1983 |jstor=2328079}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in the unlikely case in which the utility function has a quadratic form.  However, David E. Bell proposed a measure of risk which follows naturally from a certain class of von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1287/mnsc.34.12.1416 |author=Bell, D.E. |title=One-switch utility functions and a measure of risk |journal=Management Science |volume=34 |issue=12 |pages=1416–24 |date=December 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Let utility of wealth be given by 

:&lt;math&gt; u(w)= w-be^{-aw}&lt;/math&gt; 

for individual-specific positive parameters ''a'' and ''b''.  Then expected utility is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{E}[u(w)]&amp;=\operatorname{E}[w]-b\operatorname{E}[e^{-aw}]\\
                    &amp;=\operatorname{E}[w]-b\operatorname{E}[e^{-a\operatorname{E}[w]-a(w-\operatorname{E}[w])}]\\
                    &amp;=\operatorname{E}[w]-be^{-a\operatorname{E}[w]}\operatorname{E}[e^{-a(w-\operatorname{E}[w])}]\\
                    &amp;= \text{Expected wealth} - b \cdot e^{-a\cdot \text{Expected wealth}}\cdot \text{Risk}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus the risk measure is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(e^{-a(w-\operatorname{E}w)})&lt;/math&gt;, which differs between two individuals if they have different values of the parameter &lt;math&gt;a,&lt;/math&gt; allowing different people to disagree about the degree of risk associated with any given portfolio. Individuals sharing a given risk measure (based on given value of ''a'') may choose different portfolios because they may have different values of ''b''. See also [[Entropic risk measure]].

For general utility functions, however, expected utility analysis does not permit the expression of preferences to be separated into two parameters with one representing the expected value of the variable in question and the other representing its risk.

==Criticism==
Expected utility theory is a theory about how to make optimal decisions under risk. It has a normative interpretation which economists particularly used to think applies in all situations to rational agents but now tend to regard as a useful and insightful first order approximation. In empirical applications, a number of violations have been shown to be systematic and these falsifications have deepened understanding of how people actually decide.  [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] in 1979 presented their [[prospect theory]] which showed empirically, among other things, how preferences of individuals are inconsistent among the same choices, depending on how those choices are presented.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kahneman; Amos Tversky (1979). Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk. ''Econometrica'', Vol. 47, No. 2., pp. 263-292.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like any [[mathematical model]], expected utility theory is an abstraction and simplification of reality. The mathematical correctness  of expected utility theory and the salience of its primitive concepts do not guarantee that expected utility theory is a reliable guide to human behavior or optimal practice.

The mathematical clarity of expected utility theory has helped scientists design experiments to test its adequacy, and to distinguish systematic departures from its predictions. This has led to the field of [[behavioral finance]], which has produced deviations from expected utility theory to account for the empirical facts.

===Conservatism in updating beliefs===
It is well established that humans find logic hard, mathematics harder, and probability even more challenging.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Psychologists have discovered systematic violations of probability calculations and behavior by humans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Consider, for example, the [[Monty Hall problem]].

In updating probability distributions using evidence, a standard method uses [[conditional probability]], namely the [[Bayes's rule|rule of Bayes]]. An experiment on [[belief revision]] has suggested that humans change their beliefs faster when using Bayesian methods than when using informal judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Subjects changed their beliefs faster by conditioning on evidence (Bayes's theorem) than by using informal reasoning, according to a classic study by the psychologist Ward Edwards: {{cite book| author=Edwards, Ward| chapter=Conservatism in Human Information Processing|editor=Kleinmuntz, B| title=Formal Representation of Human Judgment|publisher=Wiley|year=1968}}

{{cite book| author=Edwards, Ward| chapter=Conservatism in Human Information Processing (excerpted)|editor=[[Daniel Kahneman]], [[Paul Slovic]] and [[Amos Tversky]]| title=Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1982}} &lt;br /&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Phillips |first1=L.D. |last2=Edwards |first2=W. |chapter=Chapter 6: Conservatism in a simple probability inference task (''Journal of Experimental Psychology'' (1966) 72: 346-354) |title=A Science of Decision Making:The Legacy of Ward Edwards |author3=Edwards, Ward |editor=Jie W. Weiss and David J. Weiss |isbn=978-0-19-532298-9 |page=536 |date=October 2008 |publisher= Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irrational deviations===
[[Behavioral finance]] has produced several [[generalized expected utility]] theories to account for
instances where people's choices deviate from those predicted by expected utility theory.  These deviations are described as "[[Rational choice theory|irrational]]" because they can depend on the way the problem is presented, not on the actual costs, rewards, or probabilities involved.

Particular theories include [[prospect theory]], [[rank-dependent expected utility]] and [[cumulative prospect theory]] and [[SP/A theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?q=SP/A+theory Acting Under Uncertainty: Multidisciplinary Conceptions] by George M. von Furstenberg. Springer, 1990. {{ISBN|0-7923-9063-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7923-9063-3}}. 485 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preference reversals over uncertain outcomes===
Starting with studies such as Lichtenstein &amp; Slovic (1971), it was discovered that subjects sometimes exhibit signs of preference reversals with regard to their certainty equivalents of different lotteries. Specifically, when eliciting [[certainty equivalent]]s, subjects tend to value "p bets" (lotteries with a high chance of winning a low prize) lower than "$ bets" (lotteries with a small chance of winning a large prize). When subjects are asked which lotteries they prefer in direct comparison, however, they frequently prefer the "p bets" over "$ bets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lichtenstein |first1=S. |author2=P. Slovic |year=1971|title=Reversals of preference between bids and choices in gambling decisions|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=89|issue=1|pages=46–55|issn=0096-3445|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xge/89/1/46/ |doi=10.1037/h0031207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies have examined this "preference reversal", from both an experimental (e.g., Plott &amp; Grether, 1979)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grether |first1=David M. |author2 =Plott, Charles R.|year=1979|title=Economic Theory of Choice and the Preference Reversal Phenomenon|journal=[[American Economic Review]]|volume=69|issue=4|pages=623–638|jstor=1808708}}&lt;/ref&gt; and theoretical (e.g., Holt, 1986)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holt|first=Charles|year=1986|title=Preference Reversals and the Independence Axiom |journal=[[American Economic Review]]|volume=76|issue=3|pages=508–515|jstor=1813367}}&lt;/ref&gt; standpoint, indicating that this behavior can be brought into accordance with neoclassical economic theory under specific assumptions.

===Uncertain probabilities===
If one is using the frequentist notion of probability, where probabilities are considered to be fixed values, then applying expected value and expected utility to decision-making requires knowing the probabilities of various outcomes. However, in practice there will be many situations where the probabilities are unknown, and one is operating under [[uncertainty]]. In economics, [[Knightian uncertainty]] or [[ambiguity aversion|ambiguity]] may occur. Thus one must make assumptions about the probabilities, but then the expected values of various decisions can be very [[sensitivity analysis|sensitive]] to the assumptions. This is particularly a problem when the expectation is dominated by rare extreme events, as in a [[long-tailed distribution]].

Alternative decision techniques are [[Robust decision|robust]] to uncertainty of probability of outcomes, either not depending on probabilities of outcomes and only requiring [[scenario analysis]] (as in [[minimax]] or [[minimax regret]]), or being less sensitive to assumptions.

[[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] approaches to probability treat it as a degree of belief and thus they do not draw a distinction between risk and a wider concept of uncertainty: they deny the existence of Knightian uncertainty. They would model uncertain probabilities with [[multilevel model|hierarchical model]]s, i.e. where the uncertain probabilities are modelled as distributions whose parameters are themselves drawn from a higher-level distribution ([[hyperprior]]s).

Captain '''François Mingaud''' (sometimes spelled '''Mingot''', '''Mengaud''' or '''Minguad''',&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt; and often referred to simply as '''[[Monsieur|M.]] Mingaud'''; born 4 January 1771 [[Le Cailar]], [[Nîmes]], France, died 23 December 1847, [[Rotterdam]], Netherlands&lt;ref name="Stook1"&gt;[http://www.snookergames.co.uk/history3.html ''History of Snooker Games'', Michael Stook.

He is credited as the inventor of the leather {{Cuegloss|Cue tip|tip}} for a [[Cue stick|billiards cue]], a "possibly not original idea" that he perfected while imprisoned in Bicêtre (now [[Bicêtre Hospital]]) for political outspokenness.&lt;ref name="Stook1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Everton1986"/&gt; This revolutionized the game of billiards, allowing the cue ball to be finely manipulated by the application of {{Cuegloss|Spin|spin}}.

==Personal life==
Mingaud was born in 1771 in [[Le Cailar]] near [[Nîmes]] in the Département of the [[Gard]] in France. He joined the army under Napoleon and served as a captain.

After his release from prison in Paris during 1807 he toured France and Europe demonstrating his 'trick shot' prowess.

In 1822 Mingaud settled on the Hoogstraat in [[Rotterdam]] and by 1825, when he was 54, he had remarried.

==Billiards==
French archives show Mingaud was arrested in the Netherlands for "involvement in the conspiracy of Cadoudal," (referring to [[Georges Cadoudal]]) and labeled an "adventurer whose presence in society can only be dangerous."&lt;ref name="siv.archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr"&gt;[https://www.siv.archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr/siv/rechercheconsultation/consultation/ir/consultationIR.action?udId=d_3&amp;irId=FRAN_IR_001660] on Archives Nationales: Salle des inventaires virtuelle. Retrieved 3 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He was imprisoned in Bicêtre, a men's prison in [[Paris]] which is now the site of [[Bicêtre Hospital]].&lt;ref name="siv.archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr"/&gt; (Many internet sources incorrectly report the [[Bastille]] as the site of Mingaud's imprisonment, but this is impossible. The Bastille was destroyed in the French Revolution prior to Mingaud's incarceration.)

In prison, Mingaud had access to a billiard-table and so studied the game of billiards. In this age of simple wooden cues, others had experimented with leather tips, but it was Mingaud who perfected both the design and the appropriate playing technique.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120909220649/http://www.snookergames.co.uk/history3.html Forgotten History - François Mingaud] From "Roberts on Billiards" by John Roberts (Senior) published 1869.

===Impact on the game===
In 1807, Mingaud was released from Bicêtre. Mingaud then began to demonstrate his invention and technique in the cafés of Paris.&lt;ref name="Stook1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Straip"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Everton1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt; He reportedly developed a repertoire of 40 shots, including glancing blows, side-spin, backspin, topspin and the raised cue 'massé' shots.
&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jan/10/best-sporting-equipment-gear-inventions The Guardian / The Observer, The 10: sports gear inventions by Tim Harris, Sunday 10 January 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The patrons of the cafes were astonished by the displays of control and manipulation of the cue ball that they had never seen nor imagined possible.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt; In a short time Mingaud's cue tip innovation became the norm and rapid improvements in the game followed in its wake.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt; In 1823 cue tips from Europe were introduced into the United States, but as their fame had long since preceded them, some of domestic make were already in use.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Further development of the leather cue tip - 'Hénine Ainé' was founded in 1830 and improved Mingaud's invention by creating the 'screw-in tip', making tip replacement a much easier affair.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;{{cite book |first=Victor|last=Stein|author2=Rubino, Paul|year=1996|title=The Billiard Encyclopedia: An Illustrated History of the Sport (2nd ed.)|publisher=Blue Book Publications, June 1996|pages=91,92,475|isbn=1-886768-06-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the introduction of cue tips in France [[Carom billiards]], requiring heavy manipulation of spin, became popular and the scoring by way of "hazards" or pockets was gradually abolished.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

{{Quote|How astonished were the billiard players and the billiard table manufacturers of Mingaud's day, by the results of his invention! ... When the independent amateurs of Paris saw the practical operation of Mingaud's discovery—when they saw the ordinary laws of motion apparently reversed in obedience to the whim of the person wielding the (then modern) cue—when they saw him, with a perfect mastery of his own ball, sometimes force it to describe a curve around a hat placed in the middle of the board—sometimes compel it to make angles diametrically opposed to the ordinary laws as hitherto expounded and believed—when they saw the same ball apparently possessing scarce enough force to arrive at a cushion, suddenly gather strength at the moment of impact, and fly off with increasing velocity. When they saw these things, we say, it seemed to them like magic, and it was lucky for Mingaud that the statutes against sorcery had been repealed before his day.&lt;ref name="Phelan" /&gt;|[[Michael Phelan (billiards)|Michael Phelan]] (the "Father of American Billiards") (1859)}}

===Reputation===
Mingaud's reputation grew rapidly and he became known as the 'great master of the game'. According to ''Roberts on Billiards'' published in 1893 by John Roberts :
&lt;blockquote&gt;''A few years later [after 1807] he became known as the great master of the game. He could nurse a break, screw, and cause his ball to follow with the utmost nicety and certainty.''&lt;ref name="Stook1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; ''Mingaud quietly advanced, took up [the cue] and struck the white ball, which, after contact with the red, recoiled upon him. Affecting extreme horror, he dropped the cue, and summoned the waiter, to whom he explained that when he had pushed a ball forward it ran backwards. The spectators were incredulous, and, in reply to their entreaties, Mingaud attempted another stroke, but with the same result. The balls were seized and condemned as "tormented by a devil",''&lt;ref name="Stook1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Cue and mace.jpg|thumb|Man playing billiards with a cue and a woman with a mace, from an illustration appearing in Michael Phelan's 1859 book, ''The Game of Billiards''.]]

===Invention of the Massé shot===
Mingaud is also credited with the discovery that by raising the cue vertically, to the position adopted by the mace (The forerunner of the cue, similar to a light-weight [[Golf club (equipment)|golf club]], with a square-fronted foot that was generally used to shove rather than strike the cue ball.&lt;ref name="Everton1986"/&gt;), he could perform what is now known as a {{Cuegloss|Massé|massé}} shot.&lt;ref name="Everton1986"/&gt;

==Book - ''Noble Jeu de Billard''==
[[File:The Noble Game of Billiards.png|thumb|Credit page from ''The Noble Game of Billiards'', John Thurston's 1831 second edition translation of M. Mingaud's 1827 French treatise, ''Noble Jeu de Billard'']]

In 1827, Mingaud published a book in Paris titled ''Noble Jeu de Billiard - Coups extraordinaires et surprenans.'' (''The Noble Game of Billiards. Extraordinary and surprising strokes'') It contained 43 copper-plate images and precise instructions for performing 70 strokes.

Circa 1830, this book was translated and published in English by the Billiards table Manufacturer [[John Thurston (inventor)|John Thurston]] of 14 Catherine Street, [[Strand District (Metropolis)|The Strand]].&lt;ref name="Straip"/&gt; It was published in English as :
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''The Noble Game of Billiards'' &lt;br&gt;
''Extraordinary and surprising strokes which have excited the admiration of most of the Sovereigns of Europe.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robert Byrne's 1982 book ''Byrne's Treasury of Trick Shots in Pool and Billiards'' indicated only two copies of the original work were known to exist in the USA: one in the Library of Congress, and one at University of Notre Dame.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Robert (1982). Byrne’s treasury of trick shots in pool and billiards. Orlando, FL: Harcourt Brace &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a digitized version of the 1831 second edition of Thurston's translation is now freely available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/reader?id=Y0NAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;pg=GBS.PT6] Google Books. The Noble Game of Billiards, Wherein are Demonstrated Extraordinary and Surprising Strokes Which Have Excited the Admiration of Most of the Sovereigns of Europe (Mingaud, John Thurston). Retrieved 3 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and commemoration==
He died in 1847 and his grave is in the churchyard at [[Kralingen-Crooswijk]], a suburb of Rotterdam.&lt;ref name="Straip"/&gt;

In Spanish, "Mingo" is slang for the red ball used in [[carom billiards]]. It is named after Mingaud.&lt;ref name="IEOB"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shamos | first = Michael Ian | year = 1993 | title = The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Billiards | publisher = Lyons &amp; Burford | location = New York | pages = 44–45, 67, 142–3, 149, 249 &amp; 307 | isbn = 1-55821-219-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, Cees Sprangers, Dongen, The Netherlands, began to research the 'lost mystery' that Mingaud had become. His results were for a first time published in the Dutch monthly magazine 'Biljart' in May 1991 and November 1992, later on in essay form in 1994 in Victor Stein and Paul Rubino's ''Billiard Encyclopedia''. He revealed many details of Mingaud's life, including his first name, fleshed out his personal history, and to a large extent, clarified the details on his role in the invention of the leather cue tip.&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt;

Several animated television series have started in similar incubator-type formats, including ''[[Adventure Time]]'' and ''[[Bee and PuppyCat]]''.

The project began in 2014 when [[Frederator Studios]] and [[Sony Pictures Animation]] called for pitches from animators around the world. Twelve five-minute shorts were produced, and one will become a limited series on [[Cartoon Hangover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vizworld.com/2014/11/pitch-your-animated-toon-to-go-cartoons-a-new-idea-incubator-with-funding-by-sony-pictures-animation/|title=Pitch your animated toon to GO!

[[Image:Tanec folk ensemble Macedonia 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A traditional oro in the Republic of Macedonia|A traditional oro playing in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]]]

'''Hora''', also known as '''horo''' and '''oro''', is a type of [[circle dance]] originating in the [[Balkans]] but also found in other countries.

==Etymology==
The name (spelled differently in different countries) is [[cognate]] to the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|χορός}} (''choros''): "dance" which is cognate with the [[ancient Greek]] art form of {{lang|grc|χορεία}} (''[[choreia]]''). The original meaning of the Greek word {{lang|grc|χορός}} may have been "circle". The course of the seasons was also symbolically described as the dance of the Greco-Roman {{lang|grc-Latn|[[Horae]]}}, and they were accordingly given the attributes of spring flowers, fragrance and graceful freshness.

Also, the words ''hora'' and ''oro'' are found in many [[Slavic languages]] and have the meaning of "round (dance)"; the verb ''oriti'' means "to speak, sound, sing" and previously meant "to celebrate".

The [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|χορός}} is cognate with [[Pontic Greek|Pontic]] {{lang|pnt-Latn|[[Horon (dance)|khoron]]}}, [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] {{lang|bg|хоро}} ({{lang|bg-Latn|horo}}), [[Romanian language|Romanian]] {{lang|ro|horă}}, {{lang|sh|[[kolo (dance)|kolo]]}} or оро (''oro'') in the languages of the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] form {{lang|tr|hora}}, {{lang|sq|valle}} in [[Albania]], and in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{lang|he|הורה|rtl=yes}} ({{lang|he-Latn|horah}}). The {{lang|ka-Latn|[[Khorumi]]}} dance of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] also might be connected to the [[Horon (dance)|Horon]] dance in the neighbouring [[Turkey|Turkish]] regions, as it rose out of the [[Adjara]] region, where [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]] [[Laz people]] co-existed for centuries with Greek [[Pontians]].

== Hora in Romania and Moldova ==
[[File:Stamp of Moldova md423.jpg|thumb|left]] 
[[Image:Hora din Dealul Spirei, 1857.jpg|thumb|300px|Dancing the hora on [[Dealul Spirii]] (Spirii Hill), [[Bucharest]] (1857 lithograph)]]
'''Hora''' (pl. ''hore'') is a traditional [[Romania]]n [[folk dance]] where the dancers hold each other's hands and the circle spins, usually counterclockwise, as each participant follows a sequence of three steps forward and one step back. The dance is usually accompanied by musical instruments such as the [[cymbalom]], [[accordion]], [[violin]], [[viola]], [[double bass]], [[saxophone]], [[trumpet]] or the [[pan pipes]].

The hora is popular during wedding celebrations and festivals, and is an essential part of the social entertainment in rural areas. One of the most famous hore is the ''[[Hora Unirii]]'' (Hora of the Union), which became a [[Romanian people|Romanian]] patriotic song as a result of being the hymn when [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] united to form the [[Principality of Romania]] in 1859. During the 2006/2007 New Year's Eve celebration, when Romania and [[Bulgaria]] joined the [[European Union]], people were dancing ''[[Hora Bucuriei]]'' (Hora of Joy) over the boulevards of [[Bucharest]] as a tribute to the EU anthem, [[Ode to Joy]] (Odă bucuriei). Some of the biggest hora circles can be found on early 20th century movies filmed by the [[Manakis]] brothers in [[Pindus]], Greece and performed by local [[Aromanians]].

== Horo in Bulgaria ==
[[File:Jan Mrkvička-Shopsko horo.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Shopi|Shop]] ''horo'' of Bulgaria.]]
The traditional [[Bulgaria]]n dance horo ({{lang-bg|хоро}}) comes in many shapes. It is not necessary to be in a circle; a curving line of people is also acceptable. The steps used in a horo dance are extremely diverse. The horo may vary between three and seven or eight steps forward and one to five or six steps back, depending on the specific type.

There are more than five types of horo that are usually danced at every wedding. They differ by the rhythm of the music and the steps taken. There are no two horo dances with similar steps. There are probably over one hundred types of horo dances in the Bulgarian folklore.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In the past, the horo dance had a social role in Bulgarian society. It was mainly for fun, as a contest of skills, or for show, leading to the development of the variety of horo dances. There are hora for people with little skill that can be learned in five to ten minutes, but there are also very sophisticated dances that cannot be learned unless one is fluent in many of the simpler dances.

== Oro in Macedonia ==
[[File:Prilep-fête 1919.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Women from [[Prilep]] playing oro, beginning of the 20th century.]]

[[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] uses the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] spelling of "oro" ({{lang-mk|оpo}}). The origins of Macedonian oro vary from its use in socializing and celebrating, to historical dancing before going into battle. ''Teshkoto'', translated "The difficult one", is one of those, danced by men only, the music of which reflects the sorrow and mood of war. The oro is danced in a circle, with men and women holding one another by hand. They are used to celebrate occasions such as weddings, christenings, name-days, national and religious holidays, graduations, birthdays.

== Oro in Montenegro ==
The Hora/Oro circle dance should not be confused with the [[Oro (eagle dance)|Oro dance]] in Montenegro and Herzegovina, which is a paired mating dance. Its name comes from the Serbian ''орао'', meaning "eagle".

== Hora in Turkey ==
Hora is mainly played in [[Eastern Thrace]].{{clarify |date=April 2017 |reason=Compared to the rest of Turkey? }}

== Romani Oro ==
The '''Oro''' is also popular among the [[Romani people]] of Eastern Europe, and the dancing is practically the same as that of the neighbouring ethnicities. Romani oros, and [[Romani music]] in general, are very well appreciated among non-Romani people in the Balkans, as they also have a reputation as the skilful performers of other folk music there. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

== The Horah in Klezmer music ==
The Horah in [[klezmer]] music is the same as the traditional Romanian Hora dance. It has a slow, limping gait in [[3/8 time]] and often leads into a faster and more upbeat [[freylekh]] or [[bulgar (music)|bulgar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://borzykowski.users.ch/EnglMCKlezmer.htm KLEZMER MUSIC IN A FEW WORDS]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Israeli horah ==
{{JewishMusic}}

The '''horah''' (הורה), which is somewhat different from that of some of the Eastern European countries, is widespread in the [[Jewish diaspora]] and played a foundational role in modern [[Israeli folk dancing]]. It became the symbol of the reconstruction of the country by the socialistic-agricultural Zionist movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0009_0_09187.html jewishvirtuallibrary.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Although considered traditional, some claim it rose to popularity due to Hora Agadati, named after dancer and choreographer [[Baruch Agadati]] and performed for the first time in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/06/hora_and_my_jewish_wedding_forget_tradition_i_will_not_dance_.html slate.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is usually performed to [[Music of Israel#Musical characteristics of the Israeli style|Israeli folk songs]], and sometimes to Jewish songs, typically to the music of ''[[Hava Nagila]]''.

To start the dance, everybody forms a circle, holding hands or interlocking arms behind their backs or on their shoulders&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0009_0_09187.html&lt;/ref&gt; and steps forward toward the right with the left foot, then follows with the right foot. The left foot is then brought back, followed by the right foot. This is done while holding hands and circling together in a fast and cheerful motion to the right. Large groups allow for the creation of several [[concentric]] circles.

In the early days, horah was popular mainly in [[kibbutz]]im and small communities. The dancing often continued for hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/12226/hora-history-/ Hora history]&lt;/ref&gt;

The horah became popular in group dances throughout [[Israel]], and at weddings and other celebrations by Jews in Israel, the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]]. The dance appeared in North America in the early 20th century, well before modern Israeli independence, brought directly from Eastern Europe by Jewish immigrants.

At [[bar and bat mitzvah]]s, it is customary to raise the honoree, and sometimes his or her family members, on a chair during the horah. This is also done at many Jewish weddings, following the Israeli tradition.

The song "[[Hora (song)|Hora]]", sung by [[Avi Toledano]], who represented Israel in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982]], is based on this dance.

==Premise==
Harry Houdini is a [[Skeptical movement|cynical skeptic]] and [[Atheism|atheist]] whereas Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle is a believer in the [[paranormal]] and [[supernatural]]. The drama opens in 1901 [[London]], shortly after the publication of Doyle's ''[[The Great Boer War]]''. Houdini and Doyle become involved in the investigation of several mysterious deaths. They debate over whether the causes are natural or supernatural, and often bet on the cause, which causes their police liaison, Constable Adelaide Stratton, some embarrassment.

'''''Hugo: The Evil Mirror''''' (Danish: ''Hugo: Det Afskyelige Spejl'') is a video game in the ''[[Hugo (franchise)|Hugo]]'' franchise developed by [[ITE Media]] for the PC, [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Game Boy Color]] and [[mobile phone]]s. It was released in Europe on May 2, 2002; and in North America on April 24, 2005 (by [[Namco]] for the GBA).

==Gameplay==
[[File:Hugo_TEM_gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|Gameplay on the PlayStation adaptation]]

The PC and PlayStation version is a 3D platform game adaptation similar to ''[[Crash Bandicoot]]'', where each of three troll kids have different powers and their parts have different styles of gameplay.&lt;ref name=ps/&gt;

The Game Boy (and mobile) version is a 2D platform game adaptation similar to ''[[Bubble Bobble]]'', consisting of three levels, each with 20 stages and ending with a fight against the level boss guarding a piece of the mirror. At the start of each stage, the player is tasked with eliminating all of Scylla the witch's minions in it using a freeze gun, before the time limit runs out. Hitting any unprotected enemy with the freeze beam for a few seconds will turn them into a block of ice that will shatter if pushed off a ledge or jumped on top of. Frozen enemies can be carried around and stack for gaining access to higher parts of the level or to creating even larger more powerful monsters in which to destroy in order to get the treasure contained within them (bonus points, save keys, and power-ups upgrades to health and speed). {{clear left}}

==Plot==
The wicked witch Scylla wants to get rid of Hugo the troll once and for all. She has used her powers to trap Hugo in a magic mirror that she then cracked it into three pieces and magically scattered the fragments across the world. Scylla also once again kidnapped Hugo's wife, Hugolina. Hugo and Hugolina's three children, Rit, Rat, and Ruth, are the only ones who can free their parents. To break the witch's curse, each child must find a piece of the broken mirror. If the kids put the mirror together, Hugo is able to defeat Mirror Scylla and break the spell. After the fight, Hugo gets out of the mirror, traps Scylla in it, and smashes it into little pieces, saving Hugolina.

[[File:Don Rickles 1973.JPG|thumb|120px|Publicity photo of [[Don Rickles]], a well-regarded insult comedian, in 1973.]]
'''Insult comedy''' is a [[comedy]] genre in which the act consists mainly of offensive insults directed at the performer's audience or other performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2nZzPKpwjkC&amp;pg=PA167 | title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Comedy Writing |author=James Mendrinos, Jim Mendrinos |isbn=978-1-59257-231-1 |publisher=Penguin |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical targets for insult include individuals in the show's audience, the town hosting the performance, or the subject of a [[Roast (comedy)|roast]]. An insult comedian often maintains a competitive and interactive relationship with his or her audience. The style has been described as "festive abuse".

The style can be distinguished from an act based on satire, or political humor. Insult comedy is often used to deflect or silence [[heckler]]s even when the rest of the show is not focused around it.

Its parent company, iROKO Partners, was founded by Jason Njoku and Bastian Gotter in December 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17896461 |title=Making a fortune by distributing Nigerian films online |publisher=BBC |date=7 May 2012 |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its headquarters in London, United Kingdom. Dubbed the 'Netflix' of Africa, irokotv is the world's largest legal digital distributor of African movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/410/23/77895.html |title=iROKOtv launches subscription service |publisher=Bizcommunity.com |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While living in London iroko's co-founder, Jason Njoku, realised how popular African movies had become. Despite a growing worldwide demand, there was no legal option to watch movies from his home country. He therefore decided to take matters in his own hands and negotiate licensing deals with local Nigerian producers.

== History ==
The irokotv website was launched on 1 December 2011 by iROKO Partners, who are one of the largest{{dubious|date=June 2017}} licensors and distributors of Nollywood movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdayonline.com/NG/index.php/art-a-life/44727--iroko-tv-recognised-in-forbes-most-innovative-list |title=Iroko TV recognised in Forbes most innovative list |publisher=Businessdayonline.com |date=20 September 2012 |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanipo.com/blog/2030/iROKO-Partners-wins-trademark-infringement-case-against-Iroko-TV-Movies |title=iROKO Partners wins trademark infringement case against Iroko TV Movies |publisher=HumanIPO |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Njoku, the company's CEO and Bastian Gotter, now COO, met whilst students together at the University of Manchester together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mundy |first=Simon |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bd5fd984-1050-11e1-8211-00144feabdc0.html |title=Iroko Partners: Demand proves insatiable for Nollywood on the net |work=Financial Times |date=22 November 2011 |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Njoku made several attempts to set up his own companies in the immediate years after university, but failed on each attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boafo |first=Obed |url=http://african.howzit.msn.com/njoku-projecting-nollywood |title=Jason Njoku – Njoku: Projecting Nollywood – Howzit MSN Africa |publisher=MSN |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Njoku was inspired to start the company when he found it difficult to obtain Nollywood movies online for his mother, who he was living with at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/04/business/jason-njoku-iroko-nigeria |title='Netflix of Africa' brings Nollywood to world |publisher=CNN |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having researched the Nollywood industry, and noting the lack of infrastructure in place for international distribution of the movies, Njoku flew to Lagos, Nigeria, and purchased the online licenses of Nollywood movies directly from the producers. Having struck a deal with YouTube in Germany, he used the Google-owned platform to stream the licensed Nollywood movies, for free, on his channel, Nollywoodlove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/BUSINESS/08/02/jason.njoku.nollywood.love/index.html |title='Nollywood Love': Nigerian blockbusters for the internet generation |publisher=CNN |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The channel became hugely popular and was profitable in a short period of time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newafricanmagazine.com/special-reports/country-reports/nigeria-open-for-business/nollywood-pulls-in-the-dollars |title=Nollywood Pulls in the Dollars |publisher=Newafricanmagazine.com |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the focus of a number of press features in international press, including ''[[CNBC]]'', ''[[CNN]]'' and Techcrunch. The success of Nollywoodlove led to a successful investment from US-based hedge fund [[Tiger Management|Tiger Global Management]], who led a two-round investment totalling US$8&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balancingact-africa.com/news/broadcast/issue-no132/distribution/irokotv-the-netflix/bc |title=iROKOtv, the "Netflix of Africa", reaches 500,000 subscribers in less than six months |publisher=balancingact-africa.com |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the biggest single investments into a West African Dot-com venture.

Azerbaijan was first invited by [[AMPAS]] to submit a film in the Best Foreign Language Film category in the summer of 2006,&lt;ref&gt;http://mimiatthemovies.blogspot.com/2006_07_01_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt; and they submitted for the first time in fall of 2007.

Azerbaijan's first Oscar submission was ''Caucasia'' by Farid Gumbatov - the story of an old woman leaving her war-torn Caucasian homeland for Russia, aboard a train. The following year, Azerbaijan sent ''Fortress'', a drama about a film crew making a movie in an isolated mountain town famous for its ancient fortress, and what happens when the town is threatened by a modern-day foreign invasion. Neither film made much of an impact on the international film festival circuit, and neither film managed to get an Oscar nomination.

# {{note|a}} [[Box Office Mojo]], a reliable third party box office revenue tracker, does not track any revenues earned during any [[Metro Manila Film Festival]] editions. So the official figures by film entries during the festival are only estimates taken from any recent updates from credible and reliable sources such as a film's production outfit, or from any news agencies. Also, [[Metro Manila Development Authority]] (MMDA) did not release the official gross sales of each of the films. To verify the figures, see individual sources for the references.

She is a foe of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[X-Men]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Ophelia Sarkissian===
{{main|Viper (Madame Hydra)}}

===Sixth Madame Hydra===
{{Infobox comics character| &lt;!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics--&gt;

The sixth Madame Hydra was created by [[Bob Harras]] and [[Paul Neary]], and debuted in ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #3 (Aug 1988). Madame Hydra received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #4, under the heading "Madame Hydra VI".

This operative of Hydra impressed her superiors enough that, after only a short time in the organization, they promoted her to the level of Madame Hydra VI (The identities of Madames Hydra I through V, who rank above her, are unknown). One of her first missions as Madame Hydra was to capture [[Nick Fury]] and deliver him to the Deltites, a group of artificially created duplicates which were taking over [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] After failing in her mission and discovering that the Deltites were manipulating her, she allied with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents against the takeover. She was later turned over to federal authorities and was found to be criminally insane, and sent to Arnold Sanitarium for psychiatric treatment (the same sanitarium that Bigfoot was later imprisoned in).&lt;ref&gt;''Nick Fury Vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Valentina Allegra de Fontaine===
{{main|Valentina Allegra de Fontaine}}
Valentina Allegra de Fontaine succeeded Viper as Madame Hydra where she wears an elaborate tentacle headdress and elaborate Hydra robes.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Warriors'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elisa Sinclair===
{{expand section|date=April 2017}}
Elisa Sinclair has appeared in Captain America's implanted memories that [[Red Skull]]'s clone and Kobik placed in him to make Captain America think that he is a Hydra sleeper agent. She is depicted as an ancient being with magical powers that had an extensive reach.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present, Elisa intercepts [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady]]'s [[Life Model Decoy]] counterpart Black Ant who were on their way to present evidence of Captain America's brainwashing to [[Maria Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #12&lt;/ref&gt; After keeping Taskmaster and Black Ant alive and persuading them to become her personal guards, Elisa then collects a new Hydra High Council consisting of herself, a new [[Kraken (character)|Kraken]], [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]], [[Hive (comics)|Hive]], [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]], [[Arnim Zola]], and [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #14&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Elisa reunites with Captain America after he overthrew Red Skull for leadership of Hydra.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16&lt;/ref&gt; While in her study room following Hydra's takeover of the United States, Elisa uses her magic spells to counter every one of [[Doctor Strange]]'s attempts to bring down the [[Darkforce]] dome that is surrounding [[Manhattan]]. While having tea with Captain America, Elisa is informed of Captain America's suspicion about Baron Zemo and Doctor Faustus' disloyalty. Elisa brushes off the suspicion and tells Captain America that they plan to assemble the Cosmic Cube in order to restore Earth to their vision.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Empire'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Elisa later gives Captain America the updates on the members of Hydra's Avengers. She tells him that [[Scarlet Witch]] has become unhinged due to her being possessed by [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]], [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] is still kept under Hydra's control through Arnim Zola's A.I. Virus, and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Odinson]] is still praying to [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] about his troubles like [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] being trapped in an alternate reality. As Captain America prepares to leave, Elisa tells Captain America that he has become like a son to her.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Empire'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; During Hydra's attack on the Underground's base at the Mount, Elisa detects an unusual amount of energy in the Mount and rushes in. Madame Hydra arrives and teleports Captain America away at the last second as the Tony Stark A.I. explodes where it destroys the base and Madame Hydra.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Empire'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
===Heroes Reborn===
In the ''[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]'' reality, Madame Hydra is a terrorist leader. Not much was known about her other than the fact that she answered to Hydra's leader [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], who was actually a robot built by [[Doctor Doom]].&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man'' Vol. 2 #1&lt;/ref&gt; She was later killed in battle against [[Iron Man]].&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man'' Vol. 2 #10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Midem''' is the [[acronym]] for '''Marché International du Disque et de l'Edition Musicale''', which is organised annually in and around the [[Palais des Festivals et des Congrès]] in [[Cannes]], France. The trade show, which is billed as the leading international business event for the music ecosystem, has been held since 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midem.com/the-event/|title=Meet, network and make deals at Midem|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|website=midem.com|publisher=Vivendi|accessdate=9 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809014928/http://www.midem.com/the-event/|archivedate=9 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several thousand musicians, producers, agents, managers, lawyers, executives, entrepreneurs and journalists from around the globe regularly attend the event, which is usually held at the end of January or early February. While delegates from recording, artist management, and publishers network, new artists showcase their material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/midem-festival-2013-live-in-cannes-france|title=Midem Festival 2013 - Live In Cannes, France|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also live music is on show in the evenings.

The event is developing like the industry and is now focused on the '''core music business''' (labels, publishers, rights societies and more), the '''technology''' sector (startups, developers and big tech companies), and '''brands''' and the agencies that represent them (for music and brand campaigns).

==Business role==
Midem provides a forum for business talks, political and legal discussions. It is a market where global distribution and music deals are sealed. It also is a platform for showcasing new artists, musical trends and music-related products.

==Attendance==
In January 2013, Midem was attended by 6,400 delegates from 3,000 companies (out of which 1,350 had stands or pavilions of their own). The event was covered by 350 international journalists. Although there are attendees from all over the world, the majority of delegates have been from Western Europe and North America. In 2015 many more international delegates registered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cannes-or-bust.com/cannes-events/midem/ Cannes or Bust website]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mondo film''' (from the Italian word for "world")  is an [[exploitation film|exploitation]] [[documentary film]], sometimes resembling a [[pseudo-documentary]] and usually depicting [[sensationalism|sensational]] topics, scenes, or situations. Common traits of mondo films include an emphasis on taboo subjects (such as death and sex), portrayals of foreign cultures (which have drawn accusations of [[ethnocentrism]] or racism&lt;ref name=kerekesslater108&gt;Kerekes &amp; Slater, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;), and staged sequences presented as genuine documentary footage. Over time, the films placed increasing emphasis on footage of the dead and dying (both real and fake). The term '''''shockumentary''''' is also used to describe the genre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/33094/Mondo-New-York/overview Mondo New York (1988)] The New York Times,&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|History of the genre}}History==
Although earlier films such as ''European Nights'' (1959) and ''World By Night'' 1 &amp; 2 (1961) may be considered examples of the genre,&lt;ref name=kerekesslater102&gt;Kerekes &amp; Slater, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; the origins of the mondo documentary are generally traced to the [[1962 in film|1962]] [[Italy|Italian]] film ''[[Mondo Cane]]'' (''A Dog's World''—a mild [[Italian language|Italian]] [[profanity]]) by [[Paolo Cavara]], [[Gualtiero Jacopetti]] and Franco Prosperi which was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/33089/Mondo-Cane/overview Mondo Cane (1962)] The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/02/movies/02avant.html?_r=1 Revisiting a Cinematic Smackdown, and Other Avant-Garde Pleasures] The New York Times, October 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117793199?refcatid=31 Mondo Cane] Variety Reviews, December 31, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentary films imitating ''Mondo Cane'' in the 1960s often included the term "mondo" in their titles, even if they were in English; examples include ''Mondo Bizarro'', ''Mondo Daytona'', ''Mondo Mod'', ''Mondo Infame'' and ''[[Mondo Hollywood]]''.&lt;ref name=kerekesslater107&gt;Kerekes &amp; Slater, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Films outside the genre followed suit: ''[[Mondo Trasho]]'', ''Mondo Weirdo: A Trip to Paranoia Paradise'', ''[[Mondo Keyhole]]''&lt;ref name=kerekesslater109&gt;Kerekes &amp; Slater, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Mondo Brutale'' (a German release of [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]''&lt;ref name=kerekesslater215&gt;Kerekes &amp; Slater, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;) title themselves ''mondo'', although none are mondo documentaries. Later in the decade, this naming convention began to fall out of favour and fewer mondo films identified themselves as such in their titles.&lt;ref name="kerekesslater107"/&gt;

Filmmakers wanted to top each other in shock value to attract audiences. Cruelty to animals, accidents, tribal-initiation rites and surgeries are features of a typical mondo. Much of the action is staged, although the filmmakers may claim their goal is to document "reality". Subjects of mondo films include sex (''Mondo Sex'' and ''Mondo Sexualis USA''); celebrities (''Mondo Elvis'' and ''Mondo Lugosi''); youth culture (''Mondo Teeno'') and the gay subculture (''Mondo Rocco'').

[[Russ Meyer]]'s film ''[[Mondo Topless]]'' was one of the few "documentaries" restricted to the old [[Midnight movies|midnight movie]] circuit in the pre-VCR era; it explored [[strip clubs]] in 1960s [[San Francisco]] at a time when strip clubs were a novelty in the United States, restricted to centers of port-city decadence (such as San Francisco). Other examples of this genre include ''[[Mondo New York]]'' by Harvey Keith, ''Mondo di Notte'' by Gianni Proia and ''Mondo Balordo'' by Roberto Bianchi Montero.

The 1980s saw a resurgence of mondo movies focusing almost exclusively on (onscreen) death, instead of world cultures. The ''[[Faces of Death]]'' series is a notable example of this type of mondo (or "death") movie. The producers used fake footage (passed off as real), but some of the footage was legitimate (including scenes of autopsies, suicides and accidents).

The rare 1985 film ''Mondo Senza Veli'' (''World Without Veils'' or ''Mondo Fresh'') was purported by viewers to feature at its end the brutal execution of a young Arab rapist by public rectal impalement. This episode was, however, believed to have been a staged execution by some viewers.

Mondo films in the 21st century feature gore, exemplified by the ''[[Faces of Gore]]'' and ''[[Traces of Death]]'' series. There is less fake footage, and many use news footage of accidents from [[East Asia]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

A number of films have parodied the genre. Examples include Ricardo Fratelli's '' Mondo Ford''; ''[[Mr. Mike's Mondo Video]]'' by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'''s [[Michael O'Donoghue]] and ''[[Is There Sex After Death?]]'' by Jeanne and Alan Abel. ''Mondo Beyondo'' spoofed the films' approach to titling, but was a parody of satellite television.&lt;ref name=kerekesslater155&gt;Kerekes &amp; Slater, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cannibal film|Italian cannibal film]] is arguably an offshoot of the mondo film.&lt;ref name="kerekesslater109"/&gt;

The original mondo film series was the ''Mondo Cane'' series by [[Gualtiero Jacopetti]], [[Paolo Cavara]], and Franco Prosperi. When this type of film proved successful, many imitators followed.

The pair's ''[[Mondo candido]]'' (1975) is not a "Mondo" film; the title was imposed on them by the studio, who wished to cash in on their earlier successes. The film is a retelling of [[Voltaire]]'s novel, ''[[Candide]]''.

In the late 1980s [[Stelvio Massi]] (a.k.a. Max Steele) made two spinoffs of the original ''[[Mondo Cane]]'' series, known as ''Mondo Cane 3'' and ''Mondo Cane 4'' on video.

In 1969, brothers Angelo and Alfredo Castiglioni began to make a series of their own mondo films until the early 1980s. They made five films in all, tying Jacopetti and Prosperi as the most prolific mondo film producers. Each film examines brutal and bizarre behavior on the African continent. Their films are considered some of the most graphic Mondo films ever made.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

[[Antonio Climati]], cinematographer to Prosperi and Jacopetti in many mondo films, joined [[Mario Morra]] in 1974 to produce their own string of mondo films, known as the Savage Trilogy. Prosperi also produced the films. Climati and Morra were known for staging scenes.

Uwe Schier bought the rights to the ''Mondo Cane'' and ''Faces of Death'' films and released his own entries in both series, consisting largely of footage lifted from other mondo films. ''Faces of Death 5'' draws heavily on ''Death Scenes''; ''Faces of Death 6'' consists almost entirely of ''Days of Fury'' and ''Mondo Cane IV'' (not to be confused with ''Mondo Cane 2000, l'Incredibile'', Schier's ''Mondo Cane IV'' is in fact the fifth film in the series) lifts from other films (including ''Death Scenes'' and ''Death Faces IV'').&lt;ref name=kerekesslater156158&gt;Kerekes &amp; Slater, pp. 156-158.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Hurricane Pictures edited a mix of scenes featured in ''Addio ultimo uomo'' and ''Shocking Africa'', labeling it the "fifth chapter" of the saga (''Teil V'' in German).

'''''Musica e dischi''''' is the oldest music industry publication in Italy. It was founded in October 1945 in Milan, Italy on the initiative of the journalist and musicologist Aldo Mario De Luigi, a former senior record&lt;!-- what does "record" mean here? --&gt; of VCM (now [[EMI]] Italy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicaedischi.it/storia.php|title=La Storia|language=Italian|work=Musica e dischi|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning, the magazine was published with the name ''Musica'' (''Dischi'' was added on the second edition) on a monthly basis. ''Musica e dischi'' later issued a list of best-seller music recordings nationally. On its 735th edition on December 2009, ''Musica e dischi'' director Mario De Luigi announced that they would publish an online magazine since March 2010 and stop the publication of physical magazine after 65 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rockol.it/news-104411/Cambia-Musica-e-Dischi--da-marzo-solo-in-formato-digitale-%28e-in-abbonamento%29|title=Cambia Musica e Dischi: da marzo solo in formato digitale (e in abbonamento)|language=Italian|publisher=Rockol.it|date=29 November 2009|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==

Nordoff Robbins is a registered [[UK]] [[Charitable organization|charity]] that receives no statutory funding. The charity runs the Nordoff Robbins music therapy centre in London and a number of music therapy outreach projects nationwide. It also runs postgraduate training courses in music therapy and a research programme with regular public courses and conferences.

Nordoff Robbins runs the annual [[Silver Clef Award]]s that raise money for the charity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clashmusic.com/news/coldplay-win-nordoff-robbins-award "Coldplay Win Nordoff-Robbins Award"], ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'', May 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

Founded by Dr. Clive Robbins and Carol Robbins, the Nordoff-Robbins Center for Music Therapy at [[New York University]], [[Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development]], opened in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/music/nordoff/about/|title=About the Center|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center is affiliated with New York University's Graduate Music Therapy Program. The mission of the Center has six main components:

# Providing music therapy services to children, adolescents, and adults with a wide range of needs, abilities, and disabilities including [[autism spectrum]] disorders (ASD), behavioral disorders, developmental delays, sensory impairments, multiple handicaps, and psychiatric disorders. The Center provides individual and group therapy sessions, and also provides services for adults struggling with difficult life circumstances or seeking an expressive form of therapy in order to pursue greater self-understanding.
# Offering advanced music therapy training. The Center offers three levels of training: a) fieldwork and internships for students pursuing academic degrees in music therapy; b) postgraduate certificate training in the Nordoff-Robbins approach; and c) continuing education courses for music therapy professionals.
# Conducting and publishing research. The Center maintains an extensive archive that includes recordings and documentation of the pioneering work of Nordoff and Robbins (1959-1976). The archive is continually being expanded and updated by contemporary clinical work. Ongoing research in clinical practice focuses on the role of improvisational music therapy in addressing the needs of clients with different areas of disability including autism spectrum disorder, stroke, and hearing impairment.
# Presenting lectures, workshops, and symposia to professional audiences. The Center's video documentation of therapy sessions makes it possible to communicate to professional audiences the nature and dynamics of the creative music therapy process. The Center's therapists and researchers  lecture nationally and internationally.
# Publishing musical and instructional materials. The Center produces audio, video, and printed materials that provide musical resources and instruction in clinical process and improvisation. 
# Disseminating information and resources. The Center serves as a resource for music therapists, students, musicians, allied professionals, parents, the media, and the general public. It provides consultant services, organizes seminars and workshops, and hosts over 150 visitors annually.&lt;ref name="James &amp; James Publishers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordoff-Robbins Center for Music Therapy|url=http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/music/nordoff/about/|publisher=New York University|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simpson|first1=Fraser|title=Every note counts : the story of Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy|date=2007|publisher=James and James|location=London|isbn=9781903942796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordoff-Robbins training at [[Molloy College]], established in 2010, is the newest approved Nordoff-Robbins program in the US. It is located at The Rebecca Center for Music Therapy at Molloy College, an outpatient center serving children and adults in the Long Island and metropolitan New York area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rebecca Center for Music Therapy at Molloy College|url=http://therebeccacenter.org/|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both training programs include all aspects of Nordoff-Robbins work including assessment, archival coursework, clinical work, group music therapy, and clinical improvisation instruction. Trainees come from both the US and abroad.

'''Online casinos''', also known as '''virtual casinos''' or '''Internet casinos''', are online versions of traditional ("[[brick and mortar business|brick and mortar]]") [[casino]]s. Online casinos enable [[Gambling|gamblers]] to play and wager on [[casino game]]s through the [[Internet]]. It is a prolific form of [[online gambling]].

Online casinos generally offer odds and payback percentages that are a bit higher than land-based casinos. {{fact|date=March 2018}} Some online casinos claim higher payback percentages for [[slot machine]] games, and some publish payout percentage audits on their [[website]]s.  Assuming that the online casino is using an appropriately programmed [[random number generator]], [[table game]]s like [[blackjack]] have an established house edge. The payout percentage for these games are established by the rules of the game.

Many online casinos rent or buy their software from companies like [[CryptoLogic Inc]] (now [[Amaya Gaming Group|Amaya]]), [[International Game Technology]], [[Microgaming]], [[Playtech]], [[Golden Race]] and [[Realtime Gaming]].

== Online casino types ==
Online casinos can be divided into two groups based on their interface: web-based and download-only casinos. Some casinos offer both interfaces.

=== Web-based online casinos ===
Web-based online casinos (also known as flash casinos) are websites where users may play casino games without downloading software to their local computer. Games are mainly represented in the browser plugins [[Macromedia Flash]], [[Macromedia Shockwave]], or [[Java platform|Java]] and require browser support for these plugins. Also, bandwidth is needed since all graphics, sounds and animations are loaded through the web via the plugin. Some online casinos also allow gameplay through a [[HTML]] interface. Apple devices such as iPod, iPad and iPhone cannot play Flash games as the technology is not supported.

=== Download-based online casinos ===
Download-based online casinos require the download of the software client in order to play and wager on the casino games offered. The online casino software connects to the casino service provider and handles contact without browser support. Download-based online casinos generally run faster than web-based online casinos since the graphics and sound programs are cached by the software client, rather than having to be loaded from the Internet. On the other hand, the initial download and installation of a download-based online casino client does take time. As with any download from the Internet, the risk of the program containing [[malware]] exists.

===Virtual casino games===
In a virtual casino game, the outcome of each game is dependent on the data produced by a [[pseudorandom number generator]] (PRNG). This determines the order of the cards in card games, the outcome of a dice throw, or the results produced by the spinning of a slot machine or roulette wheel. PRNGs use a set of mathematical instructions known as an algorithm to generate a long stream of numbers that give the impression of true randomness. While this is not the same as true random number generation (computers are incapable of this without an external input source), it provides results that satisfy all but the most stringent requirements for true randomness.

When implemented correctly, a PRNG algorithm such as the [[Mersenne Twister]] will ensure that the games are both fair and unpredictable. However, usually the player has to trust that the software has not been rigged to increase the house edge, as its inner workings are invisible to the user. Properly regulated online casinos are audited externally by independent regulators to ensure that their win percentages are in line with the stated odds, and this can provide a degree of assurance to the player that the games are fair, assuming the player trusts the regulator.

===Live dealer casino games===
In a live casino game, a human dealer runs the game in real time from a casino gaming table, which can be seen via a live streaming video link. Players can make betting decisions via a console on their computer screen, and can communicate with the dealer using a text chat function.

The results of the physical transactions by the dealer, such as the outcome of the roulette wheel spin or the dealing of cards, are translated into data that can be utilized by the software by means of [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) technology. This enables the player to interact with the game in much the same way as they would with a virtual casino game, except for the fact that the results are determined by real-life actions rather than automated processes.

These games are a lot more expensive for websites to host than virtual games, as they involve a heavier investment in technology and staffing. A live casino studio typically employs one or more cameramen, several croupiers running the various games, an [[information technology]] manager to ensure that any technical hitches are dealt with swiftly, and a pit boss that acts as an adjudicator in case of disputes between players and croupiers.

In most cases this requires at least a three-room setup, comprising a live studio, a server/software room, and an analyst’s room. The configuration of these rooms varies from casino to casino, with some having several gaming tables in one room, and some having a single table in each room.

The high running costs involved with operating live dealer games is the reason why online casinos only tend to offer a handful of the most popular games in this format, such as [[roulette]], [[blackjack]], [[sic bo]], and  [[Baccarat (card game)|baccarat]]. In comparison, the running costs associated with virtual games are very low, and it is not uncommon for online casinos to offer hundreds of different virtual casino games to players on their site.

Online casinos vary in their approach to the hosting of live games, with some providing live games via their own [[television channel]], and others offering the games exclusively via their website. In the case of televised games, players can often use their [[mobile phone]] or television remote controls to place bets instead of doing so via a computer connected to the internet. The most common live dealer games offered at online casinos are baccarat, blackjack and roulette.

== Games offered ==
A typical selection of gambling games offered at an online casino might include:

*[[Baccarat (card game)|Baccarat]]
*[[Blackjack]]
*[[Craps]]
*[[Roulette]]
*[[Sic bo]]
*[[Online slot games|Slot machines]]
*[[Online poker|Poker]]
*[[Keno]]
*[[Online bingo|Bingo]]

==Bonuses==
Many online casinos offer sign-up bonuses to new players making their first deposit, and often on subsequent play as well. These bonuses are a form of [[marketing]] that may incur a cost (potentially justifiable in order to attract a new player who may return and deposit many more times), since the casino is essentially giving away money in return for a commitment from the player to wager a certain minimum amount before they are allowed to withdraw. Since all casino games have a house edge, the wagering requirements ensure that the player cannot simply walk away with the casino's money immediately after claiming the bonus. These wagering requirements are commonly set to be sufficiently high that the player has a negative expectation, exactly as if they had deposited and not claimed a bonus.

Casinos may choose to restrict certain games from fulfilling the wagering requirements, either to restrict players from playing low-edge games or to restrict 'risk-free' play (betting for instance both red and black on roulette), thereby completing the wagering requirement with a guaranteed profit after the bonus is taken into account.

===Welcome bonuses===
The Welcome bonus is a deposit match bonus on the first deposit ever made in the casino or casino group. Welcome bonuses sometimes come in packages and may be given to match the first two or three deposits (First Deposit Welcome Bonus, Second Deposit Welcome Bonus, etc.). They can also be tied to specific games, such as the Welcome Slots Bonus or the Welcome Table Games Bonus. The casino may also offer Welcome bonuses for high rollers who make an initial deposit above the standard amount limit.

===Referral bonuses===
There are two types of Referral bonuses: one for the Referee and one for the Referrer. The Referee gets a bonus when he or she registers an account at the casino and mentions the Referrer. The Referrer gets a bonus when the Referee completes all the requirements, such as making the deposit and wagering it a certain number of times.

===Cashback or Insurance bonuses===
Cashback or Insurance bonuses are offered as a percentage of all losses in the player’s previous gaming activity. Typically, only deposits that were not matched with bonuses count towards this bonus. You can additionally find websites that offer casino cashback payments based your losses encountered while playing with one or more online casinos. Those type of cashback deals are usually paid back to players by the casino portal that offers those special cashback offers.

===No deposit bonuses===
The most popular form of bonus is one that can be claimed without the need to deposit any of the player's own money - known as a [[no deposit bonus]]. These bonuses are used as acquisition tools by casinos wishing to attract new players. No deposit bonuses don't always take the form of real cash, as exemplified below.

===Non-cashable bonuses===
Non-cashable bonuses may be called "sticky" or "phantom" bonuses. See "sticky bonus" and "phantom bonus"&lt;/ref&gt;  In both cases, the bonus forms a part of the player's balance, but cannot be cashed out. The difference between cash-able and phantom bonuses comes at cashout time. A phantom bonus is deducted from player's balance at the moment he places his withdrawal request. For example: if you deposited $100, received a $100, played and finished the wagering with $150. If the bonus is sticky, the player will be able to withdraw just $50. If bonus is cash-able, then the whole balance is available for withdrawal.

=== Comp points ===
{{main|Comps (casino)}}
Comps are commonly available at land-based casinos, but also exist online. Comp points can usually be exchanged for cash, prizes, or other comps. The amount of cash given per wager is usually very small and often varies with game selection.  A casino might offer three comp points for each $10 wagered on slots and one comp point for each $10 wagered on blackjack.  The casino might give $1 for each 100 comp points.  This example is equivalent to returning 0.3% of wagers on slots and 0.1% of wagers on blackjack. In addition online casinos may offer comps such as free tickets to online [[tournament]]s, free slots online, tickets to other special events, extra bonuses, souvenirs and pay back.

===Bonus hunting===
'''Bonus hunting''' (also known as '''bonus bagging''' or '''bonus whoring''') is a type of [[advantage gambling]] where turning a profit from casino, [[sportsbook]] and [[poker]] room bonus situations is mathematically possible. For example, the house edge in blackjack is roughly 0.5%. If a player is offered a $100 cashable bonus requiring $5000 in wagering on blackjack with a house edge of 0.5%, the expected loss is $25. Therefore, the player has an expected gain of $75 after claiming the $100 bonus.

===Bonus disputes===
A large portion of online casino disputes relate to bonuses. Casinos may label players who win using bonuses as "bonus abusers."  Both players and casinos may commit fraud.  An example of player fraud is creating multiple accounts and using the accounts to claim a sign-up bonus several times.  An example of casino fraud is changing terms of a bonus after a player has completed the wagering requirements, then requiring the player to meet the new bonus terms.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Fraudulent online casino operator behaviour==
Fraudulent behaviour on the part of online casinos has been documented, almost exclusively by player advocacy websites and forums. The most commonly reported behaviour is a refusal to pay withdrawals to legitimate winners. An online casino with multiple confirmed cases of fraudulent behavior is often called a '''rogue casino''' by the online casino player community.

Many casino gambling portals and player forums maintain blacklists of rogue casinos. While some carry more authority than others, all blacklists constitute individual webmaster and player opinions rather than an official list from any type of regulating body.

Often, casinos use buffer sites that offer free play of their casino games but in reality use different means of deceptive strategies to redirect or lure the visitors into signing up to their services via appealing bonus offers or exclusive reward programs. Majority of these deceptive "free" sites lead to equally deceptive casinos.

Since almost all existing online casinos offer free play of their casino games, recognising whether a casino is deceptive based on whether they offer free gameplay is no longer viable.

==Legality==
Online gambling legislation often has loopholes that result from the rapid development of the technology underpinning the development of the industry. Some countries, including Belgium, Canada, Finland and Sweden have state gambling monopolies and do not grant licenses to foreign casino operators. According to their law, operators licensed on the territory of these countries can only be considered legal. At the same time, they can't prosecute foreign casino operators and only block their sites. Players in these countries can't be punished and can gamble at any site they can access.

===Australia===
The Australian [[Interactive Gambling Act]] 2001 (IGA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://edu-librarian.com/act/au/legislation/a/1998-24/default.asp Interactive Gambling Act 1998 - Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; criminalises the supply of online casino games by an operator anywhere in the world to persons located in Australia. It only targets operators of online gambling sites, resulting in the curious situation that it is not illegal for a player in Australia to access and gamble at an online casino. No operator has even been charged with an offence under the IGA and many online casinos accept Australian customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cowie|first=Tom|title=Last Bets: around the world in online casinos — first stop, Gibraltar|url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2011/06/22/last-bets-around-the-world-in-online-casinos-first-stop-gibraltar/|work=Crikey}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, the South Australian Government became the first state or territory in the world to introduce a 15% Place Of Consumption Tax (POCT) modelled on the 2014 UK POCT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-02/sportsbet-hits-out-at-sa-governments-online-betting-tax/7680514 SA to become most expensive place in the world to wage a bet, betting agency says]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
The Belgian Gaming Act&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamingcommission.fgov.be/opencms/opencms/jhksweb_en/law/ Gaming Act]&lt;/ref&gt; went into effect in January 2011 and allows online gambling, but only under very strict conditions and surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Platteau|first1=Koen|title=Online gambling is taking off in Belgium|url=http://www.olswang.com/articles/2012/10/online-gambling-is-taking-off-in-belgium/|publisher=Olswang LLP|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107043427/http://www.olswang.com/articles/2012/10/online-gambling-is-taking-off-in-belgium/|archivedate=7 November 2012|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The Canadian criminal code states that only provincial governments and charitable organizations licensed by provincial governments may operate a casino in Canada. It also prohibits residents from participating in any lottery scheme, game of chance, or gambling activity not licensed or operated by a provincial government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Criminal Code of Canada (s.206 and s.207)|url=http://www.agco.on.ca/en/whatwedo/criminalcode.aspx|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[British Columbia Lottery Corporation]] launched Canada’s first legal online casino, [[PlayNow.com|PlayNow]], which is available to residents of [[British Columbia]]. The province of [[Quebec]] also operates a legal online casino through [[Loto-Québec]].

Despite this legislation, the [[Kahnawake]] First Nation in Quebec has taken the position that it is a sovereign nation, able to enact its own gambling legislation, and has licensed and hosted nearly 350 gambling websites, without ever being prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Crowne|first1=Emir|last2=Roy|first2=Sanjay|title=Maintaining Provincial Monopolies: The Legality of Online Gambling Sites in Canada|ssrn=1611862|magazine=Canadian Gaming Lawyer Magazine|volume=3|issue=1|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The German [[Online Casino Legislative]] 2012 (EU) many will often describes as very complex matter.The European Commission via the "EU Pilot" scheme recently questioned Germany about what steps it plans to take to eliminate the current sports-betting monopoly operated by state-owned Oddset and to also reconsider its stance on prohibiting online casino and poker games due to the huge gray market currently existing — and prospering — in the country.
Latest strike to the German Legislative was from Court of Justice for the European Union (CJEU) recently ruled against the country's restrictive online gaming laws where is clearly stated"Further to a judgment of the Court from which it can be inferred that a national law is not compatible with EU law, all organs of a Member State concerned are under an obligation to remedy that situation," Judge Advocate General Szpunar stated in 2015 year.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the Gambling Bill that was passed into law in 2005 tends to all matters of online gambling, permitting online betting sites to have a Remote Gambling Licence in order to offer online betting to UK citizens. In 2014, the UK government put into law the Gambling Act of 2014 which in addition to the original 2005 law, required offshore online gambling operators catering to UK players to obtain a UK license. The new regulation required operators to pay a 15% Place of Consumption Tax (POCT), something that triggered an exodus of sorts of some operators from the British Isles. However, this exodus did not last long in most cases as the benefits outweighed the stumbling blocks, due to the UK being a major market for online gambling.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===United States===
In the United States, the legality of online gambling is debated and can vary from state to state. The [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]] (UIGEA) limits the ability of banks and payment processors to transact with internet gambling sites that are unlawful under any federal or state law. However it does not define the legality or otherwise of an internet based gambling site. It was commonly assumed that the [[Federal Wire Act]] prohibited all forms of online gambling. However, in December 2011, the United States Department of Justice released a statement clarifying that the Wire Act applied only to sports betting sites and not to online casinos, poker, or lottery sites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vardi|first=Nathan|title=Department Of Justice Flip-Flops On Internet Gambling|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2011/12/23/department-of-justice-flip-flops-on-internet-gambling/|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CSL"&gt;{{cite book | title=Gambling in California | date=March 1997 | first1=Roger | last1=Dunstan | chapter=II.

Certain states such as Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey have started the process of legalising and regulating online gambling and it is expected that regulation will continue on a state by state basis.

'''"Pease Porridge Hot"''' or '''"Pease Pudding Hot"''' (also known as '''"Peas Porridge Hot"''') is a children's [[singing game]] and [[nursery rhyme]]. It has a [[Roud Folk Song Index]] number of 19631.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vwml.org/record/RoudFS/S316090 | title=Roud Folksong Index S316090 Pease-porridge hot, pease-porridge cold | publisher=[[English Folk Dance and Song Society]] | work=[[Vaughan Williams Memorial Library]] | accessdate=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lyrics==
The lyrics to the rhyme are:
{{Listen|filename=Pease Porridge Hot.ogg|title=Pease Porridge Hot|description=Tune for ''Pease Porridge Hot''}}
:Pease porridge hot, pease porridge cold,
:Pease porridge in the pot, nine days old;
:Some like it hot, some like it cold,
:Some like it in the pot, nine days old.&lt;ref name=Opie1997&gt;[[I. Opie and P. Opie]], ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lEsAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=Pease+pudding&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ql2LNUmU8h&amp;sig=TXKPdfnewrc-U589JAT4_HRnOGI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=q54wUNCDB-TTiwLe6IH4Aw&amp;ved=0CGsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Pease%20pudding&amp;f=false Notes and queries - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The origins of this [[rhyme]] are unknown. The name refers to a type of [[porridge]] made from [[pea]]s, [[pease pudding]], also known in [[Middle English]] as pease pottage. ("Pease" was treated as a [[mass noun]], similar to "oatmeal", and the singular "pea" and plural "peas" arose by [[back-formation]].)

The earliest recorded version of ''Pease Porridge Hot'' is a riddle found in [[John Newbery]]'s [[Mother Goose|''Mother Goose's Melody'']] (c. 1760):&lt;ref name=Opie1997/&gt;
:Pease Porridge hot,
::Pease Porridge cold,
:Pease Porridge in the Pot
::Nine Days old,
:Spell me that in four Letters?
::I will, '''T&lt;small&gt;HAT&lt;/small&gt;'''.&lt;ref&gt;Whitmore, ''The Original Mother Goose's Melody'', No. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the terms "pease pudding" and "pease pottage" are used, the lyrics of the rhyme are altered accordingly.

==Game==
[[Image:PeasePorridgeHotImage1920.png|thumb|150px|Children playing ''Pease Porridge Hot''.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''In the Nursery of My Bookhouse'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Schoolchildren often play ''Pease Porridge Hot'' by pairing off and [[clapping game|clapping]] their hands together to the rhyme as follows:
:''Pease'' (clap both hands to thighs) ''porridge'' (clap own hands together) ''hot'' (clap partner's hands),
::''pease'' (clap both hands to thighs) ''porridge'' (clap own hands together) ''cold'' (clap partner's hands),
:''Pease'' (clap thighs) ''porridge'' (clap own hands) ''in the'' (clap right hands only) ''pot'' (clap own hands),
::''nine'' (clap left hands only) ''days'' (clap own hands) ''old'' (clap partner's hands).
:''(Repeat actions for second stanza)''&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
NOTE: The actions are performed during recitation of the word or phrase, not following.

* Claudia MacFarlane recalls singing the song as "peach porridge hot".
*In the 1934 short film ''[[Mickey's Steam Roller]]'', [[Minnie Mouse]] sings the song with Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse. At the end the twins' clapping game turns into a fist fight.
*A line in the poem was used for the title of the 1959 [[Billy Wilder]] film, ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''.
*In the 1966 [[Blake Edwards]] World War II comedy ''[[What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?]]'', Major Pott ([[Harry Morgan]]) includes the last lines of the rhyme in his rantings after he is driven mad from getting lost in a maze of catacombs under the Sicilian village.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7184">The '''RTÉ Programme Classification''' (known as the '''On Screen Classification''') is a rating system for television programmes or films in Ireland.  Viewers on [[RTÉ One]] and [[RTÉ Two]] will have seen a rating that a programme has been given at the top right hand corner of their screens.  The icons appear for about 20 seconds at the start of a programme or film, usually excluding the news.  This signals the beginning of a unique initiative which will see RTÉ gradually move to a situation where most programmes will be classified as to content.

The System is an information service to television viewers, letting them know more about the content of scheduled programmes so that they can make informed decisions to view or not to view.  Children's and young adult's programmes will be labeled as such.  Programmes with explicit sex or violence is more suited to a mature audience, which will not merely be scheduled until after the 9pm watershed, but will be flagged on screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/homepage/onscreen_classification.html| title=RTÉ Television: On Screen Classification| publisher=rte.ie| accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==

===Ch: Children===
This is a programme or film that is aimed specifically at children, i.e. the pre-teenager or very young teenage audience. Examples of programmes issued this rating include ''[[Hi-5 (Australian TV series)|HI-5]]'', ''[[Barney &amp; Friends]]'', ''[[In the Night Garden]]''. (Equal to a G rating on DVD)

===GA: General audience===
A programme that would be acceptable to all audiences and tastes.  This may be or seem like a low rating, but in fact, some of the shows which receive this rating on TV, would actually receive a [[Irish Film Classification Office#DVD/VHS certificates|PG]] or a [[Irish Film Classification Office#DVD/VHS certificates|12]] certificate on [[DVD]]/[[Blu-ray]].  No programmes or films are edited or trimmed to fit the classification.  Examples of programmes issued this rating include ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'', ''[[Neighbours]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]''.  Programmes with a GA rating are sometimes similar to a PS rating.  Children's/family programmes such as ''Sabrina'' (above), will in all cases be GA (or Ch), but other GA (PS and YA) shows such as ''Neighbours'' and ''The Simpsons'' (above) will feature storylines with adult themes, in which case would reveive the PG or 12 rating on DVD/Blu-ray. (Shows with this rating are usually equal to a PG/12 rating on DVD)

===PS: Parental supervision===
A programme aimed at a mature audience, i.e. It might deal with adult themes, be moderately violent, frightening or contain an occasional swear word.  And the classification label invites parents and guardians to consider restricting children's access.  Examples of programmes issued this rating include ''[[Home and Away]]'', ''[[Packed to the Rafters]]'', ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', ''[[Brothers &amp; Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers &amp; Sisters]]''. (Shows with this rating are usually equal to a 12/15 rating on DVD)

===MA: Mature audience===
A typical 'post-watershed' programme which might contain scenes of sexual activity or violence, or the dialogue might be profane.  Examples of programmes issued this rating include ''[[Shameless (UK TV series)|Shameless]]'', ''[[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]''. (Shows with this rating are usually equal to a 15/18 rating on DVD)

==Former classifications==
===YA: Young adult===
This would be a programme or film aimed at a teenage audience, which means it may contain adult or mature themes.  That is to say that it would not be of great interest to an adult older than 18.  However, it may deal with issues which affect the teenage audience, e.g. relationships, sexual activity, sexuality and drug use.  Parents and guardians could expect that YA programmes or films might contain such material and may choose to limit their children's access.  The YA rating has fallen much into disuse as the GA and PS ratings cover teen storylines in both television and film, GA and PS do cover such things that are not suitable for children.  Examples of programmes issued this rating include ''[[Home and Away]]''

==RTÉ schedule==
The typical [[RTÉ One]] schedule is aimed at an adult audience, the 18-49 demographic, with daytime covering GA, PS and YA programmes.  GA either being shows such as reality shows which may be of no interest to children or reality shows such as ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'', which may also receive a PS rating for adult-themed content.  The soaps ''Home and Away'', which is aired fully uncut, ''Neighbours'', ''[[EastEnders]]'', [[New Zealand]] soap ''[[Shortland Street]]'', and RTÉ One soap ''[[Fair City]]'', they all receive GA, PS and YA ratings, the rest of daytime is made up of drama series and sitcoms and films at the weekend.  Programmes and films with an MA rating can only be aired after the [[watershed (television)|watershed]] (9.00pm), with the exception of several episodes of ''Home and Away'', which has received this rating before, and sitcoms such as ''[[Grounded for Life]]'', which has also received this rating in some episodes before 9.00pm. [[RTÉ News and Current Affairs]] programmes don't receive a classification.

[[RTÉ Two]]'s schedule is made up of children's, teenagers and adult programming.  On weekday mornings, the children's programming blocks [[RTÉjr]] (pre-school children) and [[TRTÉ]] (teenage show which are suitable for children's viewing) usually airs between 6.45am and 5.35pm.  Weekday evenings at 5.35pm the teen/adult  programming block, [[Two Tube]] begins with ''Neighbours'', ''The Simpsons'' and ''Home and Away'', the shows on Two Tube are aimed at the 15-24 demographic.  7.00pm-9.00pm and after 9pm are aimed at an adult audience and would air programmes and films with all classifications.  On weekends, the children's programming blocks usually air from 6.45am to 11.45am, from 11.45am the schedule returns to normal programming aimed at an adult audience beginning with the re-run episodes of the week's ''Home and Away'' and the rest of the day and night's programming made up of drama series, sitcoms and films, apart from a children's/family film which could be shown both Saturday and Sunday during the day, and ''[[The Sunday Game]]'' which is shown on Sunday afternoons.  Apart from the children's programming blocks, the rest of RTÉ Two's programming, including the programmes on Two Tube runs much like RTÉ One's schedule.

During Holidays such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]], [[Halloween]] or the summer holidays, children's or family films air during the day on both RTÉ One and RTÉ Two.

'''''Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger''''' is a real time strategy and tactical first person shooter. It is developed by Hungarian studio [[Atomic Motion]] and published by [[Evolved Games]] and [[SouthPeak Games]]. Raven Squad puts players in control of two groups of mercenary squads who have crash landed behind enemy lines in the Amazonian jungles. Each squad member has different skills which the player must use.

==Plot==
The year is 2011.

A plane has crashed in the middle of the Amazon rainforest. Raven Squad was sent there to retrieve the info the plane was carrying, except...

Your plane crashed too.

As one of the six squad members, use a mix of FPS and RTS to complete your mission, and maybe get your buddies out of there, alive.

==Reception==
Raven Squad received poor reviews averaging a 40.24% on [[GameRankings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raven Squad Game Rankings Page|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox360/947967-raven-squad/index.html|accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3xGamer issued a poor rating of 1.5 out of 5 stars due to frustrating gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://3xgamer.com/2009/10/raven-squad | title = Raven Squad Game Review  | publisher = 3xGamer | author =  Henry  | date =  | accessdate = 2009-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''spherical cow''' is a humorous [[metaphor]] for highly simplified [[scientific model]]s of complex real life phenomena.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Shelton, Robin|author2=Cliffe, J.

The phrase comes from a joke that spoofs the simplifying assumptions that are sometimes used in theoretical physics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/04/the-coase-theorem-is-widely-cited-in-economics-ronald-coase-hated-it/ Washington Post: "The Coase Theorem"]&lt;/ref&gt;

| Milk production at a dairy farm was low, so the farmer wrote to the local university, asking for help from academia. A multidisciplinary team of professors was assembled, headed by a theoretical physicist, and two weeks of intensive on-site investigation took place. The scholars then returned to the university, notebooks crammed with data, where the task of writing the report was left to the team leader. Shortly thereafter the physicist returned to the farm, saying to the farmer, "I have the solution, but it works only in the case of spherical cows in a vacuum".

'''Teen Musical Theater of Oregon''' (TMTO) is a youth theater program in [[Medford, Oregon]], USA, produced by Craterian Performances along with [[Next Stage Repertory Company]]. 

==Description==
Teen Musical Theater of Oregon includes kids age 13 - 19 but will sometimes add children age 9 - 12, known as Children's Musical Theater of Oregon, depending on the show. Along with children and teens of this age, Teen Musical Theater will sometimes add "Guest Stars" to the shows who take on roles such as Daddy Warbucks in [[Annie (musical)|Annie]] and The Man In Chair from [[The Drowsy Chaperone]]. TMTO will generally put on three productions a year - a spring show, a summer show, and a winter show.&lt;ref name="craterian"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=About Teen Musical Theater of Oregon |url=http://www.craterian.org/presenter/teen-musical-theater-of-oregon/|accessdate=22 November 2013|newspaper=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; TMTO will occasionally produce concerts with a smaller, selected cast.

==History==

Teen Musical Theater began back in 2006 with a spring production of [[Grease (musical)|Grease]]. At that time the production was called Children's Musical Theater of [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]] (CMTA) until it was later renamed Children's Musical Theater of Oregon (CMTO). The company was founded by composer and keyboardist John Taylor and his wife Rhonda Taylor.&lt;ref name="John Taylor Bio"&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=John|title=John Taylor Music Services |url=http://www.johntaylormusicservices.com/bio.htm|accessdate=22 November 2013|newspaper=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His inspiration to found this organization came from the impact John P. Healy Jr. had on him when he was a part of San Jose Children's Musical Theater. Shortly after the 2008 summer production of [[Oklahoma!]], Children's Musical Theater of Oregon was adopted by Craterian Performances. During the spring 2010 performance of [[Will Rogers Follies]], a new branch of Children's Musical Theater of Oregon was created, called Teen Musical Theater of Oregon. While CMTO is still a working entity of the organization, it has taken a back seat allowing TMTO to produce the majority of the Musical Theater of Oregon's productions.&lt;ref name="craterian"/&gt;

==Original productions==
The company has made three original productions: Broadway: A Musical Journey, Broadway II: The Journey Continues, and Moving On: TMTO in Concert. The first two being revues of many Broadway songs from many different Broadway shows including Lion King, Damn Yankees, A Chorus Line, The Color Purple and Hairspray.&lt;ref name="Broadway II: The Journey Continues"&gt;{{cite news|last=moeschl|first=richard|title="Broadway II: The Journey Continues"|url=http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090320/TEMPO/903200303/-1/rss11=22 November 2013|newspaper=Mail Tribune|date=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broadway series was created as a collaboration between John Taylor and David McCandless. Moving On was created and directed by Cailey McCandless and was a sendoff concert for eight graduating seniors who had participated in TMTO for years.

[[File:BookOfLists.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The first volume of ''The Book of Lists''.]]
The '''''Book of Lists''''' refers to any one of a series of books compiled by [[David Wallechinsky]], his father  [[Irving Wallace]]  and sister [[Amy Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Irving Wallace]], [[David Wallechinsky]], and [[Amy Wallace]], ''The Book of Lists'' (1977) {{ISBN|0-688-03183-8}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
  [[Irving Wallace]], [[David Wallechinsky]], and [[Amy Wallace]], ''The Book of Lists 2'' (1980) {{ISBN|0-688-03574-4}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
  [[Irving Wallace]], [[David Wallechinsky]], and [[Amy Wallace]], ''The Book of Lists 3'' (1983) {{ISBN|0-688-01647-2}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
  [[David Wallechinsky]] and [[Amy Wallace]], ''The Book of Lists'' (2004) {{ISBN|1-84195-553-1}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
  [[David Wallechinsky]] and [[Amy Wallace]], ''The New Book of Lists''.  New York: Canongate, 2005  {{ISBN|1-84195-719-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each book contains hundreds of lists (many accompanied by textual explanations) on unusual or obscure topics, for example:
* Famous people who died during [[sexual intercourse]]&lt;ref&gt;Book of Lists, Page 335&lt;/ref&gt;
* The world's greatest [[libel]] suits&lt;ref&gt;Book of Lists, Pages 54–57&lt;/ref&gt;
* People suspected of being [[Jack the Ripper]]&lt;ref&gt;Book of Lists, Pages 71–75&lt;/ref&gt;
* Worst places to [[hitchhike]]
* People misquoted by [[Ronald Reagan]]
* Breeds of dogs which bite people the most, and the least&lt;ref&gt;Book of Lists, Page 125&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''Book of Lists'' was published in 1977, a second volume came out in 1980 and the third appeared in 1983. ''Book of Lists for the 1990s'' was published in 1993; yet another volume, ''The New Book of Lists'', was published in 2005. The first volume was initially controversial and banned in some libraries and parts of the United States when it was published due to, among other things, a chapter that graphically described popular [[sexual positions]] and their pros and cons.&lt;ref&gt;Book of Lists, Pages 315–316&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 volume was essentially "new" in name only; it was made up primarily of reprinted and updated lists selected from the first three volumes, which have gone out of print.

Wallechinsky and Wallace  were also responsible for editing ''[[The People's Almanac]]'', which covered similar ground, as well as ''[[The Book of Predictions]]''. They also contributed a weekly column in [[Parade magazine|''Parade'' magazine]].

Other authors who have followed this basic format include [[Russ Kick]], author of ''The Disinformation Book of Lists'', and [[Louis Rukeyser]], author of ''Louis Rukeyser's Book of Lists''.

In 2005, a Canadian edition of ''The Book of Lists'' was published and credited to David Wallechinsky, Amy Wallace, [[Ira Basen]] and [[Jane Farrow]]. The book contained a mixture of content from the original three volumes, mixed in with updated material, and material with a specifically Canadian focus.

"'''The Entity'''" is the eleventh episode of the [[South Park (season 5)|fifth season]] of the animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', and 76th episode of the series overall. "The Entity" originally aired in the [[United States]] on November 21, 2001 on [[Comedy Central]]. This episode introduces Kyle's cousin Kyle. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have stated the story was inspired by the [[Segway PT]] and the general chaotic nature of airports at the time of the production, shortly following [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] and the [[Airline#The airline industry bailout|2001 airline bailout]].&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;{{Cite video | people=Parker, Trey| date=February 2005 |title=South Park: The Complete Fifth Season: "The Entity"|format=Audio commentary |url=http://southpark.cc.com/clips/qjk02k/creator-commentary-the-entity |medium=DVD Disc|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode, Kyle's cousin Kyle, a Jewish stereotype, comes to South Park for a visit. Meanwhile, Mr. Garrison comes up with a "more pleasant" alternative to airline travel, known as "IT".

==Plot==
[[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle's]] cousin, [[List of South Park families#Kyle Schwartz|Kyle Schwartz]] from [[Connecticut]], comes to live in South Park due to his mother's ailing health back at home. While Kyle was initially excited about seeing his cousin for the first time, he is baffled to see that his cousin is none other than an overly [[stereotype|stereotyped]] version of a [[Jew]], wearing his hair in a style similar to [[Woody Allen]], and has a lot of irritating characteristics. Kyle is told by his mother to take care of his cousin. Kyle, fearing that Cartman, a staunch anti-Semite, will "tear this kid apart", attempts to bribe Cartman with $40 to not make fun of him. Cartman, in an attempt to earn the bribe, struggles to avoid mocking Kyle's cousin, but eventually fails. The boys decide that Kyle's cousin is just way too irritating to live in South Park with them. Much of the episode proceeds to have the boys make constant attempts to get rid of Kyle Schwartz. In one attempt to trick him into boarding a plane to [[Antarctica]], Kenny is mistaken for a terrorist and shot through the head. However, Kyle's cousin always finds a way to come back to South Park.

Meanwhile, Mr. Garrison, annoyed and fed up with the inefficient and frustrating airline check-ins since 9/11, decides to invent his own vehicle. Inspired by watching [[Enrique Iglesias]]' sexualized singing on [[television|TV]] and by a [[gyroscope]] sitting next to him on his deck, he invents the gyroscope-powered [[monowheel]] "IT". According to Mr. Garrison, "IT" can "go up to two hundred miles per hour, and gets three hundred miles to the gallon". The only problem is that "IT" is controlled through a quite painful and unappealing method; using four "flexi-grip handles" that somewhat resemble erect [[human penis|penises]]; two held in the hands, one in the mouth, and a fourth handle which is inserted into the anus. Garrison invites many important investors to see his demonstration of "IT". Despite this unorthodox control mechanism, "IT" is still considered better than dealing with the airlines and Garrison's creation is a smashing success. This results in a lack of passengers and business in airports.

Unfortunately, things go downhill when the government decides to [[bailout|bail out]] the airlines from going under because of "IT". To ensure the airlines' dominance as a mode of transport and the job security of everyone working for it, the government ends up outlawing "IT", deems using it a criminal act and confiscates all of the "IT" stock. As a result, Kyle's cousin, who turns out to have invested in "IT", gets a $5 million bailout payment and decides to return home to Connecticut to take care of his sick mother. After hearing of this great fortune, the boys suddenly change their plan and try to convince him to stay with them, but he rejects them.

==Production==
According to the creator commentary, the depiction of Kyle's cousin was partially based on their experience working with radio host [[Dennis Prager]].&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt;

==Home release==
"The Entity", along with the fourteen other episodes from ''South Park: the Complete Fifth Season'', were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on February 22, 2005. The set includes brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=South Park: The Complete Fifth Season DVD Review |publisher=Bullz-Eye |date=February 26, 2009 |last=Codding |first=Jamey  |url=http://www.bullz-eye.com/television_reviews/2001/south_park_5.htm |accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Pagan Christ: Recovering the Lost Light''''' is a 2004 non-fiction book by Canadian writer [[Tom Harpur]] (1929-2017), a former [[Anglican]] priest, journalist and professor of Greek and New Testament at the [[University of Toronto]], which supports the [[Christ myth theory]].&lt;ref&gt;http://hnn.us/article/6641 
"The Leading Religion Writer in Canada ... Does He Know What He's Talking About?" by W. Ward Gasque&lt;/ref&gt; Harpur claims that the New Testament shares a large number of similarities with ancient Egyptian and other pagan religions, that early Church leaders fabricated a literal and human Jesus based on ancient myths,  and that we should return to an inclusive and universal religion where the spirit of Christ or Christos lives within each of us.

The book was named the Canadian non-fiction bestseller of the year by both the ''[[Toronto Star]]''  and ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. It was later released under the title '''''The Pagan Christ: Is Blind Faith Killing Christianity?''''' in the United States by Walker Books and in Australia by Allen Unwin. It has also been published in five foreign languages: in Montreal (''Le Christ païen'') by Éditions du Boréal, in the Netherlands (''De heidense Christus'') by Ankh-Hermes bv, in Germany (''Der heidnische Heiland'') by Ansata Verlag, in Brazil (''O Cristo Dos Pagaos'') by Editora Cultrix-Pensamento and in Japan (異教キリスト) by Basilico.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tomharpur.com/books/paganchrist/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thomasallen.ca/site/Rights.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the book became the basis for a [[#CBC documentary|CBC documentary]], and that same year, Harpur published a more scholarly sequel entitled 
''Water Into Wine: An Empowering Vision of the Gospels''.

==Synopsis==

===Similarities between Christianity and pagan religions===

Throughout the book, Harpur details stories and sayings in the [[New Testament]] which he claims also appear in ancient myths, particularly pointing out the similarities between Jesus and the Egyptian sun god [[Horus]]. He states that a number of pagan cultures in different regions and time periods drew on symbolic themes such as virgin birth, deity father, star in the east, raising of the dead, descent into hell, crucifixion, resurrection, and others. Harpur claims that virtually all words and actions attributed to Jesus in the gospels "originated thousands of years before."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Harpur, ''The Pagan Christ'' (Toronto: Thomas Allen Publishers, 2004), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Although early church leaders such as [[Justin Martyr]] and [[St. Augustine]] reportedly acknowledged certain commonalities between pagan religions and Christianity, Harpur explains that the extent of these similarities was hidden until the discovery of the [[Rosetta Stone]] in 1799.

===Plagiarism by the early Christian church===

According to Harpur, most modern biblical scholars agree the gospels were written many decades after the presumed death of Jesus, and he concludes the scriptures are inconsistent, inaccurate and do not represent a verifiable historical record. Harpur even makes the case that the original authors of the New Testament set out to combine popular pagan myths with prophecies of the Old Testament, never intending for readers to take these allegorical stories literally. In what he calls "one of the most far-reaching tragedies in history," he presents the case that the Christian church in the third and fourth centuries "made a fatal and fateful error," namely inventing the myth of a literal and historical Jesus based on "sublime truth."&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He further suggests that ultra-conservative [[Christianism|Christianists]] "did everything in their power, through forgery and other fraud, book burning, character assassination, and murder itself, to destroy the crucial evidence."&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; According to Harpur's sources, their propaganda included selectively editing the scriptures and inserting false passages about Jesus into the text of the Jewish historian [[Josephus]].&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, pp. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal doubt about historic Jesus===

Asking the question, "can we say with any authority that Jesus of Nazareth actually existed as historical person", he concludes, "I have a very grave doubts we can," adding that his gradual realization that Jesus was a "mythical copy of many preceding saviours" was difficult to accept himself.&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, pp. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the [[Jesus myth theory]], Harpur contends, "there is no hard historical evidence for Jesus' existence," and "no contemporary non-Christian writer even knew of Jesus."&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Noting his belief that the [[Pauline epistles]] or letters of [[Saint Paul]] (which were written before the [[gospel|four gospels]]), do not mention the parables and miracles of Christ, and make no reference to biographical details like Nazareth, Harpur concludes, "I am compelled, therefore, by my own independent research to agree that Paul's Christ was not Jesus of Nazareth."&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, he states that biblical literalism "commits idolatry by making a flesh-and-blood man into God,"&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; and that worshiping a perfect superman with magical powers who supposedly lived 2000 years ago is not a sustainable path for the future of Christianity.

===Continued belief in the divine Christ===

On  Harpur's website and jacket cover, ''The Pagan Christ'' is said to reveal "a cosmic faith built on these truths that the modern church has renounced", and calling for a "return to an inclusive religion where Christ lives within each of us."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tomharpur.com/books/paganchrist/&lt;/ref&gt; According to Harpur, he has spent his entire life searching for answers, and now that he understands the scriptures represent symbolic allegories on a central theme rather than cryptic history, God seems more "relevant and real,"&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; and "the Bible comes alive wholly in a new way."&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of challenging his religious faith, Harpur attests that his discoveries "have made a joyous and life-changing imprint," which have "transformed my view of the future of Christianity it into one of hope."&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
The bibliography for ''The Pagan Christ'' contains over 80 published authors who are cited in the book. Harpur has been studying the classics and the Bible since he was a [[Rhodes Scholar]] in the early 1950s, and he draws on individuals as diverse as [[St. Augustine]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] for supporting quotes. However, he bases many of his arguments on the writings of relatively unknown authors [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]] (to whom the book is dedicated), [[Gerald Massey]] and [[Godfrey Higgins]]. He also opens himself to criticism by quoting contemporary atheists such as [[Earl Doherty]] and [[Acharya S]], who are often targeted by biblical literalists and apologists. As for "scholars and critics who believe that Jesus was not historical", Harpur presents a list from American historian [[Harry Elmer Barnes]], that was first published 1929, featuring [[Bruno Bauer]], [[Albert Kalthoff]], [[Arthur Drews]], [[J. C. Stendel]], [[:de:Emil Felden|Emil Felden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Felden|first=Emil|title=Der Spiritismus und die anderen okkulten Systeme unserer Zeit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Y2NnQEACAAJ|year=1918|origyear=First published 1910|publisher=Oldenburg|location=Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Felden|first=Emil|author-link=:de:Emil Felden|editor-last=Schmidt|editor-first=Heinrich|editor-link=Heinrich Schmidt (philosopher)|others=Deutscher Monistenbund|encyclopedia=Was wir Ernst Haeckel Verdanken (What We Owe to Ernst Haeckel): Ein buch der Verehrung und Dankbarkeit|title=Felden Pastor an St. Martini Bremen|trans-title=Pastor of St. Martini Church,  Bremen, Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W-AOAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA125|language=German|year=1914|publisher=Verlag Unesma G.m.b.H.|volume=2|location=Leipzig|pages=125–128|quote=testimony of Emil Felden in ''Was wir Ernst Haeckel Verdanken'', vol. ii, p. 125.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Jensen (Orientalist)|Peter Jensen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jensen|first=Peter|title=Das Gilgamesch-Epos in der Weltliteratur: Die Ursprünge der alttestamentlichen Patriarchen-, Propheten- und Befreier-Sage und der neutestamentlichen Jesus-Sage.

==CBC documentary==
In December 2007, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] aired a documentary called ''The Pagan Christ'', based on Harpur's book, as part of its Doc Zone series.  Filmed by Bank Productions, it was one of the most-watched television documentaries in Canada that year and received mostly favourable comments on the CBC website.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20080513171957/http://www.tomharpur.com/documentary-afterword.asp | Harpur's archived afterword, December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The program won the Platinumo Remi Award at the [[Houston International Film Festival]] and the Golden Camera Award for best documentary at the U.S. International Film and Video Festival in Redondo Beach, California.

''The Pagan Christ'' joins a list of documentaries with sensational claims against orthodox Christianity that have originally aired before either Christmas or Easter, that includes ''Bible Secrets Revealed'' (November to December, 2013) and ''The Lost Tomb of Christ'' (March, 2007).

==Reception==

In a 2004 article entitled "The Leading Religion Writer in Canada ... Does He Know What He's Talking About?", Vancouver-based pastor W. Ward Gasque strongly critiques ''The Pagan Christ,'' claiming the "evidence for Jesus as a historical personage is incontrovertible."&lt;ref name = "Gasque"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Leading Religion Writer in Canada ... Does He Know What He's Talking About?|url = http://hnn.us/article/6641/|website = hnn.us|accessdate = 2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reports that only one of the ten [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]]s who responded to his emails (nine of whom were not identified) were familiar with Kuhn, Higgins and Massey, and that they unanimously dismissed an Egyptian etymology for Jesus.&lt;ref name = "Gasque"/&gt;

Ron Leprohon, Professor of Egyptology at the University of Toronto, has demonstrated that Harpur and his mentor, [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]], were wrong on at least one point. Harpur and Kuhn's claim that the Egyptian deity Horus and Jesus are the same deity is based on faulty syntax. 'In any event, the name 'Iusa' simply does not exist in Egyptian.'&lt;ref&gt;''Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea'', Stanley Porter and Stephen Bedard (Toronto: Clements Publishing, 2006), 73&lt;/ref&gt;

James A. Beverley, author and professor at Tyndale Seminary in Toronto, wrote a brief article in 2004 called "The Pagan Tom Harpur" for the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada, using a more light-hearted tone than the title suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley E Porter and Stephen J. Bedard, Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea (Toronto: Clements Publishing, 2006), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The EFC - The Pagan Tom Harpur|url = http://www.evangelicalfellowship.ca/page.aspx?pid=1747|website = www.evangelicalfellowship.ca|accessdate = 2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley E. Porter]] and Stephen J. Bedard offer a refutation of Harpur's ideas from an evangelical standpoint in ''Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea''. The 2006 book from Clements Publishing challenges the key ideas lying at the foundation of Harpur's thesis. Porter, president and dean of [[McMaster Divinity College]] in Hamilton, and Stephen J. Bedard, a Baptist minister and graduate of McMaster Divinity, state, 'If the proponents of the Pagan Christ theory had any evidence even close to the quality of [[The Epic of Gilgamesh]] material, there would be some reason to consider their claims. Unfortunately for their arguments, their evidence lacks substance and the claims are, therefore, shockingly weak.'&lt;ref&gt;Stanley E Porter and Stephen J. Bedard, Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea (Toronto: Clements Publishing, 2006), 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Porter and Bedard conclude that there is sufficient evidence for the historicity of Jesus and assert that Harpur is motivated to promote "universalistic spirituality". Porter appeared in the CBC documentary, and David Brady Productions approached the authors about creating a counter documentary for Canada's [[VisionTV]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://1peter315.wordpress.com/2009/01/03/unmasking-the-pagan-christ-the-documentary/ Stephen Bedard's Hope website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Porter's colleague at McMaster Divinity College, Gordon L. Heath, also produced a paper called "Neither Scholarly or a Solution" which offers a critique of the book. The author concedes he agrees with Harpur on several points such as their shared aversion to rigid fundamentalism and that the church has done shameful things in the past, but disagrees on most other points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcmaster.ca/mjtm/pdfs/MJTM%206.7%20Heath%20on%20Harpur.pdf ''Neither Scholarly Nor A Solution: A Response to Tom Harpur's The Pagan Christ'']. Gordon L. Heath.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, theologian and author [[Robert M. Price]] wrote a review which raised a number of concerns about Harpur's premise and evidence. Price noted that the book "contains many dubious fact claims".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertmprice.mindvendor.com/reviews/harpur_pagan_christ.htm "Tom Harpur, The Pagan Christ: Recovering the Lost Light"]. [[Robert M. Price]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bart D. Ehrman]] Professor of Religious Studies at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] on his ehrmanblog in 2012 and in his book published the same year, [[Did Jesus Exist? (Ehrman)|''Did Jesus Exist? The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth'']], lists Harpur along with other "mythicists" such as Price, but does not specifically criticize the details in ''The Pagan Christ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Did Jesus Exist?

In 2013, New Testament scholar [[Craig A. Evans]] noted that the views of Harpur and Kuhn have been "thoroughly refuted and is not followed by any reputable historian or Egyptologist."&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig A. Evans|Evans, Craig A]]. (2012).

'''''The Power of One''''' is a 1992 American [[drama film]] based on [[Bryce Courtenay]]'s 1989 novel ''[[The Power of One (novel)|The Power of One]]''. Set in [[South Africa]] during World War II, the film centers on the life of Peter Philip 'Peekay or PK' Kenneth-Keith, an [[British diaspora in Africa|English South African]] boy raised under [[apartheid]], and his conflicted relationships with a German [[pianist]], a [[Coloured]] boxing coach and an [[Afrikaner]] romantic interest.  Directed and edited by [[John G. Avildsen]], the film stars [[Stephen Dorff]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] and featured (a then-unknown) [[Daniel Craig]] in his film debut.

==Plot==
Born in 1930 to a recently widowed Englishwoman on a homestead in rural [[Natal Province|Natal]], little Peter Philip ([[Guy Witcher]]) is schooled in the ways of England by his mother and the ways of Africa by a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] nanny ([[Nomadlozi Kubheka]]), whose son Tonderai is also his best friend. Their easy life is forever shattered, however, when the farm's cattle are claimed by ''[[rinderpest]]''. PK's mother succumbs to a nervous breakdown, and he is sent away to a conservative [[Afrikaans]] boarding school while she recovers.

Being the only English student at the boarding school, PK soon earns almost universal contempt from his scathing [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]] fellows—particularly an older student, Jaapie Botha. Botha's abuse and his inferiority complex strikes PK with a severe case of [[nocturnal enuresis]], a habit which he eventually overcomes with local [[Traditional healers of South Africa|sangoma]] Dabula Manzi. In conquering his nightmares, PK is given a chicken (''Mother Courage''), which becomes his closest companion. Botha subsequently captures PK and Mother Courage and has them tried before a mock court while elaborating on the depth of his hatred for the British&amp;mdash;a people he holds responsible for atrocities committed during the [[Second Boer War]]. The Afrikaans boys hang Mother Courage and kill her with a rock. When PK physically retaliates against Botha, they attempt to execute him in a similar manner but are interrupted by a teacher who later oversees Botha's expulsion.

With his mother dying, PK finds himself living with his grandfather in [[Barberton, Mpumalanga|Barberton]]. He eventually seeks a mentor in Karl "Doc" von Vollensteen ([[Armin Mueller-Stahl]]), a lonely [[Germans|German]] musician who lost his family in Europe. Doc warms to PK and under his guidance the latter soon becomes an excellent pianist. He is interned as an enemy alien at the onset of [[World War II]], but PK continues to visit him regularly in prison. Doc introduces the boy to Geel Piet ([[Morgan Freeman]]), a [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] inmate who takes von Vollensteen's place as PK's mentor, training him to be an excellent boxer. Piet also impresses on PK his [[mantra]]: "first with the head, then with the heart", a phrase that will see the young man through even greater hard times ahead.

A maturing PK ([[Simon Fenton]]) begins to express sympathy towards black prisoners, who are detained under appalling conditions. He works with Doc to distribute contraband among the Africans, writing their letters to home, and sharing their many sufferings. The war does not end happily for PK, as Doc is repatriated and Piet&amp;mdash;seriously injured by a white warder&amp;mdash;fails to survive his sentence. PK is sent away again, this time to study at the prestigious Prince of Wales School in [[Johannesburg]]. While attending a boxing championship, he is enamoured by Maria Marais, daughter of a leading [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] official. Since her strict father will not permit them to see each other openly, they begin dating in secret. On one such outing they are introduced to Gideon Duma, a prominent boxer in [[Alexandra, Gauteng|Alexandra]], a notorious black township. Duma's passion for resisting [[apartheid]] inspires PK, and he begins teaching English at a rural African school.

Maria's father, incensed by the couple's ongoing relationship and PK's ties to a multiracial gym, leads him to request a formal investigation by one of his [[South African Police]] contacts, Colonel Breyten. Breyten and his sergeant, an embittered Jaapie Botha, place PK under surveillance for subversion. His clashes with the SAP finally come to a head when Maria is killed during a raid on a biracial church by the security forces. Maddened by grief, PK considers fleeing to England, but is consoled by his former boxing partner, who reminds him of all the good he can still do in Africa.

Botha leads a violent raid on Alexandra the following night. He threatens to shoot Elias Mlungisi, the local boxing promoter, only to be confronted by PK. They spar; PK easily bests his childhood enemy. Botha is still bent on executing the erstwhile victor, but an arriving Gideon Duma dispatches the policeman with a cricket bat before he can fire and fractures his skull. Now fugitives from the apartheid government, PK and Duma vow to continue a campaign against racial injustice. Peter's closing narration identifies meaningful voices during his life; from mother and nanny, to Doc and Dabula Manzi, Geel Piet and, finally, Maria Marais.

==Critical reception==
The film received mixed reviews. Review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]] currently ranks the film at a 39% 'rotten' rating, based on 18 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/power_of_one/?name_order=asc |title=The Power of One (1992) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave it two and a half stars out of four, stating that the nature of troubles of South Africa "are too complex to be reduced to a formula in which everything depends on who shoots who", but did add "there are some nice touches," such as the locations and Gielgud's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-power-of-one-1992 |title=The Power of One |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |date=March 27, 1992 |work=[[RogerEbert.com]] |access-date=October 30, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602122757/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-power-of-one-1992 |archivedate=June 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Two for the Seesaw''''' is a 1962 American [[romance film|romantic]]-[[drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Robert Wise]] and starring [[Robert Mitchum]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]]. It was adapted from the [[Two for the Seesaw (play)|Broadway play]] written by [[William Gibson (playwright)|William Gibson]].

==Plot==
Jerry Ryan (Mitchum) is a lawyer from Nebraska who has recently separated from his wife. To get away from it all, he has moved to a shabby apartment in New York. He is struggling with the divorce, which has been filed but is not final, and takes long walks at night.

At a party he meets Gittel Mosca (MacLaine), a struggling dancer. They instantly get along, and begin to fall in love. But the relationship is hampered by their differences in background and temperament.

Jerry gets a job with a New York law firm and prepares to take the bar examination. He helps Gittel rent a loft for a dance studio, which she rents out to other dancers. But their relationship is stormy, and Jerry has
difficulty separating himself emotionally from his wife.

They prepare to move in together nevertheless, but Gittel is upset when she learns that the divorce came through and Jerry did not tell her about it. Jerry explains that even though he is divorced from his former wife on paper, they remain bonded in many ways. He and Gittel decide he needs to return to Nebraska.

==Production==

[[Paul Newman]] was originally slated to star opposite [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in the film.

DVD commentary, ''The Hustler''&lt;/ref&gt;

"Second Chance", the title tune, became a pop music and jazz standard, recorded by [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and other artists. At the [[35th Academy Awards]],  the "Song From Two for the Seesaw (Second Chance)" from Two for the Seesaw – Music by [[André Previn]]; Lyric by [[Dory Langdon]] was nominated for [[Best Original Song]] but lost to [[Days of Wine and Roses (film)|Days of Wine and Roses]]. The movie was also nominated for [[Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography, Black and White]] ([[Ted D. McCord]]). However, [[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]] (Jean Bourgoin and Walter Wottitz) triumphed over it.

MacLaine revealed on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'' on April 11, 2011 that she and Mitchum began a relationship during the filming of this film that lasted until his death.
