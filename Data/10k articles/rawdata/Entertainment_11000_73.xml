'''1080i''' (also known as '''[[Graphics display resolution#FHD|Full HD]]''' or [[BT.709]]) is an abbreviation referring to a combination of [[video frame|frame]] [[Image resolution|resolution]] and scan type, used in [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) and [[high-definition video]]. The number "1080" refers to the number of horizontal lines on the screen. The "i" is an abbreviation for [[interlacing|"interlaced"]]; this indicates that only the odd lines, then the even lines of each frame (each image called a video field) are drawn alternately, so that only half the number of actual image frames are used to produce video. A related display resolution is [[1080p]], which also has 1080 lines of resolution; the "p" refers to [[progressive scan]], which indicates that the lines of resolution for each frame are "drawn" in on the screen sequence.

The term assumes a [[widescreen]] [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of [[16:9]] (a rectangular TV that is wider than it is tall), so the 1080 lines of vertical resolution implies 1920 columns of horizontal resolution, or 1920 pixels × 1080 lines. A  1920 pixels × 1080 lines screen has a total of 2.1 [[Pixel#Megapixel|megapixels]] (2.1 million pixels) and a temporal resolution of 50 or 60 [[Interlacing|interlaced]] fields per second. This format is used in the [[SMPTE 292M]] standard.

The choice of 1080 lines originates with [[Charles Poynton]], who in the early 1990s pushed for "square pixels" to be used in HD video formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poynton.com/notes/misc/Poynton-square-pixels.html |title=Charles Poynton – square pixels and 1080 |last1=Poynton |first1=Charles |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast standard==
[[Image:Interlaced video frame (car wheel).jpg|thumb|An example frame of poorly deinterlaced video. Despite the fact that most TV transmissions are interlaced, plasma and LCD display technologies are progressively scanned. Consequently, flat-panel TVs convert an interlaced source to progressive scan for display, which can have an adverse impact on motion portrayal.]]

Within the designation "1080i", the ''i'' stands for [[Interlaced video|interlaced scan]]. A frame of 1080i video consists of two sequential [[field (video)|fields]] of 1920 horizontal and 540 vertical [[pixel]]s. The first field consists of all odd-numbered TV lines and the second all even numbered lines. Consequently, the horizontal lines of pixels in each field are captured and displayed with a one-line vertical gap between them, so the lines of the next field can be interlaced between them, resulting in 1080 total lines. 1080i differs from [[1080p]], where the ''p'' stands for [[progressive scan]], where all lines in a frame are captured at the same time. In ''native'' or ''pure'' 1080i, the two fields of a frame correspond to different instants (points in time), so motion portrayal is good (50 or 60 motion phases/second). This is true for [[interlaced video]] in general and can be easily observed in still images taken of fast motion scenes. However, when 1080p material is captured at 25 or 30 ''frames''/second, it is converted to 1080i at 50 or 60 ''fields''/second, respectively, for processing or broadcasting. In this situation both fields in a frame do correspond to the same instant. The field-to-instant relation is somewhat more complex for the case of 1080p at 24 ''frames''/second converted to 1080i at 60 ''fields''/second.

The [[field rate]] of 1080i is typically 60&amp;nbsp;Hz (i.e., 60 fields per second) for countries that use or used [[CCIR System M|System M]] ([[NTSC]] and Brazilian [[PAL-M]]) as analog television system with 60 fields/sec (such as United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Philippines), or 50&amp;nbsp;Hz for regions that use or used [[576i|625-lines]] ([[PAL]] or [[SECAM]]) television system with 50 fields/sec (such as most of Europe, most of Africa, China, India, Australia, New Zealand, Middle East, and others). Both field rates can be carried by major digital television broadcast formats such as ATSC, DVB, and ISDB-T International. The frame rate can be implied by the context, while the field rate is generally specified after the letter i, such as "1080i60". In this case 1080i60 refers to 60 fields per second. The [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) prefers to use the resolution and ''frame rate'' (not field rate) separated by a [[slash (punctuation)|slash]], as in ''1080i/30'' and ''1080i/25'', likewise 480i/30 and 576i/25.&lt;ref&gt;"High Definition (HD) Image Formats for Television Production," EBU-TECH 3299, EBU.UER, Geneva, January 2010, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; Resolutions of 1080i60 or 1080i50 often refers to 1080i/30 or 1080i/25 in EBU notation.

1080i is directly compatible with some [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] [[High-definition television|HDTVs]] on which it can be displayed natively in interlaced form, but for display on [[Progressive scan|progressive-scan]]—e.g., most new LCD and plasma [[Television set|TVs]], it must be deinterlaced. Depending on the television's video processing capabilities, the resulting video quality may vary, but may not necessarily suffer. For example, film material at 25fps may be deinterlaced from 1080i50 to restore a full 1080p resolution at the original frame rate without any loss. Preferably video material with 50 or 60 motion phases/second is to be converted to 50p or 60p before display.

Worldwide, most HD channels on satellite and cable broadcast in 1080i. In the [[United States]], 1080i is the preferred format for most broadcasters, with [[Discovery Communications]], [[Viacom]], [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]], [[Comcast]] owned networks broadcasting in the format; along with most smaller broadcasters. Only [[21st Century Fox]]-owned television networks and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]-owned television networks, along with [[MLB Network]] and a few other cable networks use [[720p]] as the preferred format for their networks; [[A+E Networks]] channels converted from 720p to 1080i sometime in 2013 due to acquired networks already transmitting in the 1080i format. Many ABC affiliates owned by [[Hearst Television]] and former [[Belo Corporation]] stations owned by [[Tegna, Inc.|TEGNA]], along with some individual affiliates of those three networks, air their signals in 1080i and upscale network programming for master control and transmission purposes, as most syndicated programming and advertising is produced and distributed in 1080i, removing a downscaling step to 720p. This also allows local newscasts on these ABC affiliates to be produced in the higher resolution (especially for [[weather forecasting]] presentation purposes for map clarity) to match the picture quality of their 1080i competitors.

Some cameras and broadcast systems that use 1080 vertical lines per frame do not actually use the full 1920 pixels of a nominal 1080i picture for image capture and encoding. Common subsampling ratios include 3/4 (resulting in 1440x1080i frame resolution) and 1/2 (resulting in 960x1080i frame resolution). Where used, the lower horizontal resolution is scaled to capture and/or display a full-sized picture. Using half horizontal resolution and only one field of each frame (possibly with added anti-alias filtering or progressive capture) results in the format known as qHD, which has frame resolution 960x540 and 30 or 25 frames per second. Due to the chosen 16x16 pixel size for a compressed video packet known as a ''macroblock'' as used in ITU H.261 to H.264 video standards, a 1080 line video must be encoded as 1088 lines and cropped to 1080 by the de-compressor. The 720 line video format divides perfectly by 16 and therefore does not require any lines to be wasted.

"'''201'''" is the sixth episode of the [[South Park (season 14)|fourteenth season]] of ''[[South Park]]'', and the 201st overall episode of the series. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on April 21, 2010. The episode continued multiple storylines from the previous episode, "[[200 (South Park)|200]]", in which a group of angry celebrities demand South Park produce the [[Muslim]] prophet [[Muhammad]]. In "201", a superhero-like group of religious figures team up to save South Park from the celebrities and their monster [[Mecha-Streisand]], while [[Eric Cartman]] learns the true identity of his father.

The episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]]. Like "200", it alludes to several past storylines and controversies from previous ''South Park'' episodes, especially Comedy Central's refusal to show images of Muhammad on the network following controversies in [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|2005]] and [[Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy|2007]] when cartoons [[Depictions of Muhammad|depicting Muhammad]] ran in European newspapers, resulting in riots and threats. Prior to the broadcast of "201", the radical Muslim organization [[Revolution Muslim]] posted a warning on their website that Parker and Stone risked being murdered for their depiction of Muhammad. Comedy Central modified Parker and Stone's version of the episode, obscuring all images and [[bleeping]] all references to Muhammad—to the effect of disruptively obscuring the entire two-minute [[moral|moral conclusion]] of the story. Nevertheless, both "200" and "201" were nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Animated Program in 2010.&lt;ref name="2010emmy"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2010/animation-general | title = 62nd Primetime Emmys Nominees and Winners | publisher = Television Academy | accessdate = 20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The censorship drew strong criticism of Comedy Central. Critics said that the network's action would encourage further threats from radical groups. "201" was not shown in repeats, has not been made available on the ''South Park'' website, and has not been shown in Sweden, Hungary, Australia or the Netherlands. In most places the episode "[[Sexual Healing (South Park)|Sexual Healing]]" was shown instead of episode 201. In the United Kingdom, some parts were removed, and a short on-screen message appears, stating the outline of the removed parts and "MTV (on Viva)" or "Comedy Central" "...has refused to air an image of Muhammad on their network". According to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was seen by 3.5 million viewers, making it the most watched cable television program of the night.

On January 31, 2014, the original uncensored version was [[Internet leak|leaked]] when it was pulled from the South Park Studios servers and was posted online in its entirety without approval by Comedy Central.&lt;ref name=AVCLUBLEAKED&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Neal|first=Sean|title=An uncensored version of South Park's controversial Muhammad episode has surfaced|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/the-uncensored-version-of-south-parks-controversia-107422|publisher=[[The A.V. Club]]|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The episode opens with [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], as his [[hand-puppet]] persona Mitch Conner, narrating a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to Connor's 1972 [[military discharge|medical discharge]] from his [[Vietnam War]] [[tour of duty]] in a parody of a scene from the film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' as the song "[[Time of the Season]]" by [[the Zombies]] plays in the background. Back in the present, [[Mr. Garrison]] refuses to reveal the identity of Cartman's father, and instead sends [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] to [[Dr. Mephisto]]. Meanwhile, the [[Ginger Kids|Ginger Separatist Movement]] and the townsfolk are negotiating the handover of [[Muhammad]] when [[Mecha-Streisand]] begins to attack South Park. Muhammad, who is visually obscured throughout the entire episode by a black box superimposed with the word "CENSORED", is taken by [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] to Dr. Mephisto's lab. The Gingers arrive and take Muhammad and Cartman captive. The Super Best Friends are called to South Park to help; after their powers fail to subdue Mecha-Streisand, they pacify her by having [[Krishna]] adopt the form of [[Neil Diamond]] and providing her the opportunity to perform a duet with him.

The Gingers contact the celebrities and offer to share Muhammad in exchange for access to the celebrities' "goo transfer machine", which transfers Muhammad's power to remain free from ridicule to a target individual. [[Tom Cruise]] is the first subjected to the process, gaining a "CENSORED" box identical to Muhammad's, but further transfers are interrupted when the Super Best Friends arrive to free their comrade Muhammad. Meanwhile, Cartman is taken to the Ginger lair to meet [[Scott Tenorman]], the Head Ginger. Depicted as a melodramatic madman, Scott has decorated his lair to represent the Chili Con-Carnival in which [[Scott Tenorman Must Die|Cartman gained his revenge on Scott by tricking him into eating his own parents]]. He reveals to Cartman that they shared the same father, former [[Denver Broncos]] player [[List of South Park families#Jack Tenorman|Jack Tenorman]], meaning that by his act of revenge against Scott, Cartman had killed his own father and fed him to his half-brother.

The fight between the Super Best Friends, celebrities, and Gingers spills over into the Ginger lair, and Tenorman escapes in the confusion. During the fight, Seaman leaps upon Cruise's back, leading Stan to observe, "Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back." The "CENSORED" box over Cruise disappears, and all present continue to make jokes based on the fact that the words "Seaman" and "[[semen]]" sound the same. Cruise questions why they are able to do this, which leads to a monologue from Kyle, [[Jesus Christ]], and [[Santa Claus]] explaining that the goo does not exist, and that threatening people with violence is the only true answer. In the censored version, this explanation is completely obscured by a continuous audio bleep.

As the town begins to rebuild following the Mecha-Streisand attack ("for the 39th time", according to Mayor McDaniels), Stan, Kyle, and Kenny find Cartman crying&amp;nbsp;– not because he learned that he murdered his father, but because he is "half-ginger". Mitch Conner reminds Cartman that he is "half-Bronco" as well and tells him that makes him "pretty cool" and departs. The boys find Cruise crying for a place in which he can live without fear of mockery. Stan, Kenny and Kyle promise to help Cruise get to such a place. The episode's closing shot is of Cruise's corpse lying on the Moon's surface alongside the corpse of the orca featured in "[[Free Willzyx]]".

==Production==
Written and directed by series co-founder [[Trey Parker]], "201" was rated [[TV-MA]] L in the United States. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on April 21, 2010. The episode continued multiple storylines from the previous episode "[[200 (South Park)|200]]", the 200th entry of the series. Parker and fellow co-creator [[Matt Stone]] decided to celebrate their 200th episode by revisiting several subplots that had been featured throughout the show's 14 seasons. Multiple celebrities have been lampooned throughout the series' history, inspiring Parker and Stone to have all the past celebrities join in a class action lawsuit against the town of South Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jardin |first=Xeni |title=South Park's 200th, litigious celebs and Mohammed: Matt Stone and Trey Parker |publisher=[[Boing Boing]] |date=April 13, 2010 |url=http://www.boingboing.net/2010/04/13/south-park-turns-200.html |accessdate=April 25, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419132734/http://www.boingboing.net/2010/04/13/south-park-turns-200.html |archivedate=19 April 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ginger kids—children with fair skin, freckles and red hair—have been featured in several past episodes, where they were ridiculed by Cartman, who views them with prejudice.&lt;ref name="EW0415"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Tucker |first=Ken |title='South Park' 200th episode review: Muhammad, Tom Cruise, and Cartman's daddy issues |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=April 15, 2010 |url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2010/04/15/south-park-200th-episode/ |accessdate=April 25, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418203805/http://watching-tv.ew.com/2010/04/15/south-park-200th-episode/ |archivedate=18 April 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] |title=Celebrating South Park's 200 episode: Five of the best |date=April 25, 2010 |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/821914-celebrating-south-parks-200-episode-five-of-the-best |accessdate=April 15, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100418210433/http://www.metro.co.uk/news/821914-celebrating-south-parks-200-episode-five-of-the-best| archivedate= 18 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartman uses a hand-puppet con-artist named Mitch Conner who originally appeared in the [[South Park (season 7)|seventh season]] episode "[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]", in which Cartman pretends his hand is [[Jennifer Lopez]] and uses many Hispanic stereotypes in his portrayal of her.&lt;ref name="AVClub0414"&gt;{{Cite news|last=O'Neal |first=Sean |title=South Park: "200" |work=[[The A.V.

[[File:South park muhammad.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|An image of the [[Muslim]] prophet [[Muhammad]] was shown in the 2001 episode "[[Super Best Friends]]", but was censored from the 2006 episode "[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]" due to the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]]. This change in Comedy Central's broadcast policy was mocked in the episode "[[200 (South Park)|200]]", which led to further censorship in "201".]]
{{see also| South Park controversies#Censorship of the depiction of Muhammad}}
One of the most prominent storylines from "200", which continued into "201", was the characters' efforts to bring Muhammad into public view. This is based on two past controversies in 2005 ([[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]]) and 2007 ([[Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy]]), when European newspapers published cartoons of Muhammad, resulting in riots, global protests, and death threats toward the artists. As a result of those incidents, many publications and television studios have refused to broadcast images of Muhammad in any form, which was the inspiration behind Tom Cruise's efforts to harvest Muhammad's apparent immunity to satire and ridicule.&lt;ref name="EW0415" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=South Park creators court fury after including Prophet Muhammad in no-holds-barred 200th episode |date=April 15, 2010 |work=[[Daily Mail]] |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1266228/South-Park-creators-court-fury-including-Prophet-Muhammad-holds-barred-200th-episode.html |accessdate=April 25, 2010 |location=London| archiveurl= https://archive.is/20100419173144/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1266228/South-Park-creators-court-fury-including-Prophet-Muhammad-holds-barred-200th-episode.html| archivedate= 19 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Muslims warn South Park after Mohammed joke |work=[[The First Post]] |date=April 21, 2010 |last=Edwards |first=Tim |url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/62467,people,entertainment,muslims-warn-south-park-after-mohammed-appears-in-bear-suit-in-200th-episode |accessdate=April 25, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424055642/http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/62467%2Cpeople%2Centertainment%2Cmuslims-warn-south-park-after-mohammed-appears-in-bear-suit-in-200th-episode |archivedate=24 April 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker and Stone have previously voiced dissatisfaction that images of Muhammad had been censored on the show despite the fact that his image was shown during the 2001 episode "[[Super Best Friends]]", without any censorship, before the cartoon controversies began.&lt;ref name="EW0415" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AVClub0414" /&gt; "201" continues the theme from "200" that argues against fear and censorship, and calls for support of [[free speech]], both of Muhammad's image and any subject considered taboo.&lt;ref name="Wente"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Wente |first=Margaret |author-link=Margaret Wente |title=Jihad jitters at Comedy Central |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=April 24, 2010 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/jihad-jitters-at-comedy-central/article1545262/ |accessdate=April 25, 2010 |location=Toronto| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100426144421/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/jihad-jitters-at-comedy-central/article1545262/| archivedate= 26 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Murray |first=Douglas |author-link=Douglas Murray (author) |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=April 19, 2010 |title=South Park celebrates 200th episode with another attempt to show us...Mohammed! |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/douglasmurray/100035408/south-park-celebrates-200th-episode-with-another-attempt-to-show-us-mohammed/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423070958/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/douglasmurray/100035408/south-park-celebrates-200th-episode-with-another-attempt-to-show-us-mohammed/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 23, 2010 |accessdate=April 21, 2010 |location=London |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the week between the broadcasts of "200" and "201", the website for the New York-based radical Muslim organization [[Revolution Muslim]] posted an entry that included a warning to creators Parker and Stone that they risked violent retribution for their [[depictions of Muhammad]]. The entry stated that they "will probably wind up like [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] for airing this show." Van Gogh was a filmmaker who was murdered by a man named [[Mohammed Bouyeri]] in 2004 for making a [[Submission (2004 film)|short documentary]] on violence against women in some Islamic societies. The posting provided the addresses to Comedy Central in New York and the production company in [[Los Angeles]]. The author of the post, [[Zachary Adam Chesser]], said it was meant to serve as a warning to Parker and Stone, not a threat, and that providing the addresses was meant to give people the opportunity to protest.

The entry included audio clips of a sermon by [[al-Qaeda]] imam [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] calling for the assassination of anyone who has defamed Muhammad, saying, "Harming Allah and his messenger is a reason to encourage Muslims to kill whoever does that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/04/19/security-brief-radical-islamic-web-site-takes-on-south-park/ |title=Security Brief: Radical Islamic Web site takes on 'South Park' |last=Lister |first=Tim |date=April 25, 2010 |work=CNN |accessdate=April 25, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100423171319/http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/04/19/security-brief-radical-islamic-web-site-takes-on-south-park/| archivedate= 23 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2010/04/20/website-warns-south-park-creators-face-retribution-depicting-muhammad/ |title='South Park' Creators Could Face Retribution for Depicting Muhammad, Website Warns |last=Miller |first=Joshua Rhett |date=April 20, 2010 |work=Fox News |accessdate=April 25, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423141649/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2010/04/20/website-warns-south-park-creators-face-retribution-depicting-muhammad/ |archivedate=23 April 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the website for the organization was hacked, temporarily redirecting web traffic to images of Prophet Muhammad with a bomb on his head and an older Muslim man kissing a young boy passionately.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120707033921/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2010/04/23/revolution-muslim-website-hacked-in-retaliation-for-targeting-south-park-creators/ "Revolution Muslim website hacked in retaliation for targeting South Park creators"], ''[[National Post]]'', (April 23, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Before "201" aired, the [[New York City Police Department]] increased security at the Comedy Central headquarters in direct response to the threats. Law enforcement officials said Revolution Muslim itself was "all talk" and had never engaged in any actual violence but they were concerned that the website post could inspire violence from others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Mark |last=Hosenball |title=Security Stepped Up at Comedy Central Following Threats Against 'South Park' |date=April 23, 2010 |work=[[Newsweek]] |url=http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/declassified/archive/2010/04/23/security-stepped-up-at-comedy-central-following-threats-against-south-park.aspx |accessdate=April 25, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426042405/http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/declassified/archive/2010/04/23/security-stepped-up-at-comedy-central-following-threats-against-south-park.aspx |archivedate=26 April 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Weiss |first1=Murray |last2=Calabrese |first2=Erin |title='South Park' jihad patrol |work=[[New York Post]] |date=April 24, 2010 |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/south_park_jihad_patrol_Fs4cDARjkSU05bSXZ6NFjM |accessdate=April 25, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100426181728/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/south_park_jihad_patrol_Fs4cDARjkSU05bSXZ6NFjM| archivedate= 26 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the original broadcast of "201" on April 21, 2010, all references to Muhammad's name were obscured by [[Bleep censor|audio bleeps]]. Several other portions of dialogue were also censored, including almost the entirety of three consecutive monologues spoken by Kyle, [[Jesus]] and [[Santa Claus]] at the end regarding the moral of the episode. Muhammad's name appeared in the previous episode, "200", without any such censorship. Both episodes obscured all images of what was apparently Muhammad with a black "CENSORED" box. Immediately after the episode "201" aired, the series website ''South Park Studios'' posted a notice that said Comedy Central had inserted "numerous additional bleeps throughout the episode" after Parker and Stone submitted their final cut to the network. The network later confirmed they were responsible for the audio censorship.&lt;ref name="Itzkoff"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Itzkoff |first=Dave |title='South Park' Episode Is Altered After Muslim Group's Warning |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 22, 2010 |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/south-park-episode-is-altered-after-muslim-groups-warning/?hp |accessdate=April 25, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100425044606/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/south-park-episode-is-altered-after-muslim-groups-warning/?hp| archivedate= 25 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=de Moraes |first=Lisa |author-link=Lisa de Moraes |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=April 23, 2010 |title=Lisa de Moraes: Joe Biden keeps his cool in 'The View' hot seat |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/22/AR2010042205891_3.html?sid=ST2010042206430 |accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2010, South Park Studios released a brief statement:&lt;ref name="Itzkoff" /&gt;

{{quote|In the 14 years we've been doing South Park we have never done a show that we couldn't stand behind. We delivered our version of the show to Comedy Central and they made a determination to alter the episode. It wasn't some [[Meta-joke#Joke about jokes (metahumour)|meta-joke]] on our part. Comedy Central added the bleeps. In fact, Kyle's customary final speech was about intimidation and fear. It didn't mention Muhammad at all but it got bleeped too. We'll be back next week with a whole new show about something completely different and we'll see what happens to it.}}

Some of these developments had been anticipated in the 2006 ''South Park'' episodes "[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]" and "[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]". These episodes showed South Park's reaction to a controversy regarding censorship of Muhammad depictions on two (fictional) episodes of ''[[Family Guy]]''.

In the United States "201" has never re-aired following its original debut as ''South Park'' would usually repeat during the week, and episodes from earlier in the season were shown instead. Although ''South Park Studios'' generally makes [[Expurgation|unexpurgated]] versions of their episodes immediately available to view, the notice indicated Parker and Stone did not have network approval to show their original version, and thus no version of "201" could be seen on the website.&lt;ref name="Wente" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Itz0422"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Itzkoff |first=Dave |title='South Park' Episode Altered After Muslim Group's Warning |date=April 22, 2010 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/arts/television/23park.html?src=me |accessdate=April 25, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100426120614/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/arts/television/23park.html?src=me| archivedate= 26 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian [[Comedy Network]] aired "201" on April 25, 2010, though the episode was censored as the American broadcast was, breaking the network's multi-year practice of airing ''South Park'' completely uncensored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Brief South Park Update| first = Jaime| last = Weinman| date=April 25, 2010|authorlink = | url =http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/04/25/brief-south-park-update/| newspaper = [[Macleans]]| accessdate =April 26, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100427071126/http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/04/25/brief-south-park-update/| archivedate= 27 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither "200" nor "201" were shown in the version of Comedy Central in the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Verver |first=Jody |title=CC International heeft er met grote tegenzinvoor gekozen om de 2 afl.van South Park niet uit te zenden. |date=April 30, 2010 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Verver |first=Jody |title=de veiligheid van onze medewerkers is prioriteit nummer 1 en is er uit voorzorg besloten de 2 afleveringen niet uit te zenden. |date=April 30, 2010 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and neither episode is available on the Dutch ''South Park Studios'' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southpark.nl/episodes/1405/|title=South Park Episode Player – 200|accessdate=May 2, 2010|publisher=South Park Studios Netherlands |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Verver |first=Jody |title=Dit geldt helaas ook voor online.De US heeft deze voorzorgsmaatregel genomen om de veiligheid van haar medewerkers te garanderen. |date=April 30, 2010 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish affiliate of Comedy Central also refused to broadcast "200" and "201" in Sweden, claiming:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=South Park Muhammad joke won't air in Sweden |work=[[The Local]] |date=April 29, 2010 |url=http://www.thelocal.se/26366/20100429/ |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503001847/http://www.thelocal.se/26366/20100429/ |archivedate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Comedy Central has decided not to air these two episodes of ''South Park''. It is a decision we've made with great reluctance. Comedy Central believes strongly in creative freedom of expression; when unique and deeply insightful creative talents like those behind South Park are able to express themselves freely, we all benefit. However, the safety of our employees is our unquestioned number one priority, and therefore we have decided to take these precautionary measures.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Super Best Friends" was also pulled from the ''South Park Studios'' site following the increased media attention from "201".&lt;ref name="Itz0422" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/episodes/103940/ |title=South Park Episode Player – Super Best Friends |publisher=South Park Studios |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100508170347/http://www.southparkstudios.com/episodes/103940/ |archivedate=8 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Episodes "200" and "201" are also unavailable on [[Hulu]], the [[iTunes Store]], and other streaming and download services.

===Reviews===
''[[The A.V.

However, he also said, "it's sure to become one of, if not ''the'' most talked-about episode of ''South Park'' ever."&lt;ref name="ONeal0421" /&gt; Even after Comedy Central announced they were responsible for the censorship in "201", he speculated as to whether it was possibly a publicity stunt by Parker and Stone to create controversy and increase viewership.&lt;ref name="ONeal0422"&gt;{{Cite news |last=O'Neal |first=Sean |title=UPDATED: Comedy Central heavily censors last night's ''South Park'' episode after warning from Muslim group |work=[[The A.V.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The consequence of this position is that the thugs win and people have more incentive to be thugs. There are lots of people out there who would very much like to get certain kind of material removed, whether religious or political. The more they see others winning, the more they will be likely to do the same. Behavior that gets rewarded gets repeated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Seventeen [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning cartoonists protested the threats in a petition released April 27, 2010. Among the signatures were those of [[Garry Trudeau]], [[Mark Fiore]], [[Tony Auth]], [[David Horsey]] and [[Paul Szep]]. The petition stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Cavna |first=Michael |title=Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonists condemn censorship of 'South Park' |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=April 29, 2010 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/28/AR2010042805369.html |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We, the undersigned, condemn the recent threats against the creators of South Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, by the extremist organization, Muslim Revolution. Freedom of expression is a universal right and we reject any group that seeks to silence people by violence or intimidation. In the United States we have a proud tradition of political satire and believe in the right to speak or draw freely without censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Petition, "Pulitzer Prize winning editorial cartoonists issue condemnation of threat against South Park Creators" (sic), dated April 27, 2010, as posted on the ''Washington Post'' website. Retrieved April 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the April 22 broadcast of Comedy Central's ''[[The Daily Show]]'', host [[Jon Stewart]] responded to the censorship of "201" with a ten-minute monologue about the death threats, expressing disgust toward Revolution Muslim, culminating with a song telling Revolution Muslim to "go fuck [themselves]". Stewart criticized Comedy Central's decision to alter the episode, while simultaneously acknowledging they likely did so to protect their employees from "possible harmful repercussions".&lt;ref name="JonStewart" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PatrickGoldstein" /&gt; [[Bill Maher]], host of the [[HBO]] talk show ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', said the threats against "201" demonstrated the importance of the First Amendment and other American civil liberties, and said, "When South Park got threatened last week by Islamists incensed at their depiction of Muhammad, it served—or should serve—as a reminder that our culture isn't just different than one that makes death threats to cartoonists. It's better." He added jokingly, "If you don't get that, and you still want to kill someone over a stupid cartoon, please make it ''[[Garfield]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Cavna |first=Michael |title='SOUTH PARK': Bill Maher to radical Muslims: Freedom of speech is 'not negotiable' |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=May 3, 2010 |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2010/05/cartoon_nutwork_bill_maher_to.html |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of Revolution Muslim's statement, Seattle cartoonist Molly Norris suggested that many people draw and publish pictures of Muhammad on May 20, 2010, which she dubbed the "first annual [[Everybody Draw Mohammed Day]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d2/Everybody_Draw_Mohammed_Day.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Cavna |first=Michael |title=Comic Riffs: 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!' grows in reaction to 'South Park' |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=April 25, 2010 |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2010/04/everybody_draw_mohammed_day_ga.html |accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, very few cartoonists actually joined her in criticizing Islam or depicting the prophet Muhammed; instead, much like Maher and Stewart, they merely praised her for her efforts and condemned the idea of censorship. Norris herself went into hiding, shortly thereafter, on the advice of the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=On the Advice of the FBI, Cartoonist Molly Norris Disappears From View|work=[[Seattle Weekly news]] |date=September 15, 2010 |url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2010-09-15/news/on-the-advice-of-the-fbi-cartoonist-molly-norris-disappears-from-view/ |accessdate=July 8, 2012|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In a 2016 oral history of ''South Park'' in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', [[Vernon Chatman]], the voice of [[Towelie]] as well as a writer and producer on the show said that after Comedy Central censored the episode, series co-creator Trey Parker purchased a ticket to South Africa and showed it to the head of the network as a threat because [[Dave Chappelle#Season 3 turbulence|Dave Chappelle]] had fled to Africa, though Parker never actually went.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parker|first1=Ryan|title=Holy Shit, 'South Park' Is 20!

===Sri Lanka ban===
The depiction of [[Buddha]] snorting [[cocaine]] in "200" and "201" prompted the government of [[Sri Lanka]] to ban the entire series outright.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2010/04/25/american-television-depicts-buddha-snorting-cocaine/comment-page-1/ American Television Depicts Buddha Snorting Cocaine | The Sunday Leader&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home release==
The fourteenth season of ''South Park'' was released April 26, 2011 to DVD and Blu-ray, including the episode "201". When playing the episode, prior to the theme playing, a text card appears saying: "The following episode appears as it originally aired on April 21, 2010. After it aired Matt Stone and Trey Parker released the following statement" and then shows the original message that was released after the episode aired. Consequently, Muhammad, his name, and the speeches made by Kyle, Jesus, and Santa are still censored as in the broadcast version. Although the end speeches are still censored, the bleeps are accompanied with music on DVD, unlike the April 21, 2010 airing, which featured a raw audio bleep.

In the episode's audio commentary, Parker only comments on the opening scene, noting that they did the episode as intended and sent it in. He and Stone comment that they are not supposed to talk about it. For the next several moments, a large audio beep obscures the commentary before Stone says "Yeah, that's pretty much it." During the commentary in both "201" and "200" Parker and Stone never mention Muhammad directly, referring to him only as "the prophet of the Muslim faith".&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{Cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]|date = April 2011|title=South Park: The Complete Fourteenth Season: "201" |type=Audio commentary DVD |publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the package claiming otherwise, both "200" and "201" were omitted from the [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 4]] release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ezydvd.com.au/DVD/south-park-the-complete-14th-season-3-disc-box-set/dp/820263 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903133836/http://www.ezydvd.com.au/DVD/south-park-the-complete-14th-season-3-disc-box-set/dp/820263 |archivedate=2011-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been completely omitted from the [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 2]] (which contains the predominantly Islamic [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]) release as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/South-Park-Season-14-DVD/dp/B0052WHLGM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1316449399&amp;sr=8-1 "South Park – Season 14 &amp;#91;DVD&amp;#93;"].

==Online leak of uncensored version==
On January 31, 2014, the original uncensored version of this episode was illegally [[Internet leak|leaked]] and distributed online without any approval of Comedy Central after a user on [[4chan]] realized that the episode existed on the official website's web server and could be downloaded using [[rtmpdump]].&lt;ref name=AVCLUBLEAKED/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://4archive.org/board/b/thread/530038028 4chan archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show, but it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.

'''[[Jesus]]:''' That's right. Don't you see, gingers, if you don't want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop.

'''[[Santa Claus|Santa]]:''' That's right, friends. All you need to do is instill fear and be willing to hurt people and you can get whatever you want. The only true power is violence.

Despite having been leaked uncensored, "201" as well as "Super Best Friends" and "200" have still not aired in reruns and are still only legally available on DVD.

'''ATMOS Software Productions Pty. Ltd.''' is an [[Australia]]n [[computer game]] development company.  ATMOS created the scenario for [[Ambrosia Software]]'s ''[[Escape Velocity Nova]]''. The name "ATMOS" comes from the word "atmosphere". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ambrosiasw.com/forums/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=101465&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1514373 | author=Dafydd Williams (pipeline) | title=Ambrosia Software forums post | accessdate=2007-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2000 to 2005, two of the company, Luke Smart and Dafydd Williams (and sometimes others), would occasionally record "meetings" known as '''ATMOS Tonight'''. These presented the thoughts of the developers in a humorous fashion.

'''Adrena Adrena''' is a collaboration between visual artist '''Daisy Dickinson''' and drummer '''E-Da Kazuhisa'''.

Kazuhisa was previously the drummer of the Japanese noise band [[Boredoms]] and is currently with the British electronic/post-rock band [[Seefeel]]. The duo cut a raw blend of drums, noise and organic visual work, featuring in their performances an eight-foot white sphere that hangs above Kazuhisa’s drum kit and which Dickinson maps videos on to; her work was described by William Barns-Graham of Fluid Radio as ‘cosmological and transcendental, drawing attention to the wonder of the earth and our sensuality on it’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fluid-radio.co.uk/2017/01/audio-visual-session-sculpture-adrena-adrena-ovo/|title=Live Session: Sculpture, Adrena Adrena &amp; OvO|date=2017-01-05|work=Fluid Radio|access-date=2017-07-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their debut was at the International Festival of Projections in early 2016, and they have since performed at the [[End of the Road Festival]], Supernormal Festival, Fort Process Festival, Zorofest in [[Leipzig]], Splice Festival and other shows across the UK and Europe with [[Acid Mothers Temple]] and members of [[Wire (band)|Wire]] and [[Bo Ningen]].

In 2016, the pair completed a short film, ''Man on the Hill'', which features Kazuhisa playing drums on fire in the mountains. The film has since been featured on the [[British Council]] Film website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://film.britishcouncil.org/man-on-the-hill|title=British Council Film: Man on the Hill|last=Film|first=British Council|website=film.britishcouncil.org|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the film was nominated for the [[BFI London Film Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/lff/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=talesofmysteryandimagination|title=Buy cinema tickets for Tales of Mystery and Imagination {{!}} BFI London Film Festival 2016|website=whatson.bfi.org.uk|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Encounters Short Film and Animation Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://encounters-festival.org.uk/events/lets-dance/|title=Let's Dance - MUSIC VIDEOS &amp; DANCE FILMS - Encounters Film Festival|newspaper=Encounters Film Festival|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] qualifying Aesthetica Short Film Festival, [http://www.londonexperimentalfilmfestival.com The London Experimental Film Festival], [http://www.vienna-film-festival.com Vienna Independent Short Film Festival] and the [http://shortfilms.org.uk London Short Film Festival].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shortfilms.org.uk/events/2017-01-08-new-shorts-experiments-leftfield-luscious|title=NEW SHORTS: Experiments: Leftfield + Luscious|website=shortfilms.org.uk|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was also featured in [[I-D|i-D Magazine]] Japan, naming Dickinson as one of the five most watched filmmakers in Japan at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://i-d.vice.com/jp/article/5-most-watched-film-maker-from-japan|title=ロンドンで活躍する5組の日本人映像作家 |work=i-D|access-date=2017-07-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are featured as one of [[Cafe Oto]]'s artists, accompanied by a review from Gavin Burrows of the blog Lucid Frenzy which reads "The centre of the stage was taken up by projections which, always simple and often semi-abstract, never stole the limelight from the music. It was more like watching a trio, just one at work on different senses to the others. Pretty soon you weren't taking in the sights and sounds as separate elements at all, but hand been induced into a kind of synaesthesia. And if that seems like we're reverting to Sixties terminology like 'trip' we might as well go with it.... it felt like a trip (man), like being taken through some other reality then dumped back in ours at the end." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cafeoto.co.uk/artists/adrena-adrena/|title=Adrena Adrena  ← People ← Cafe OTO|website=www.cafeoto.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018 they performed [http://shortfilms.org.uk/events/2018-01-12-opening-night-movements-of-a-nebulous-dawn 'Movements of a Nebulous Dawn'] for the opening night of the [[London Short Film Festival]] at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.art/whats-on/lsff-movements-nebulous-dawn|title=LSFF: Movements of a Nebulous Dawn|website=www.ica.art|language=en|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; London, presenting a one-off audiovisual collaboration with a 360-degree nebulous orb defying the conventions of theatrical presentation as musicians performed in-the-round beneath multiple circular projections created by Dickinson. The improvised live set curated by Adrena Adrena featured guest musicians [[Damo Suzuki]] ([[Can (band)|Can]]), [[Geraldine Swayne]] ([[Faust (band)|Faust]]), [[Colin Newman]] ([[Wire (band)|Wire]]), [[Malka Spigel]] ([[Minimal Compact]]) and Kenichi Iwasa ([[Krautrock Karaoke]]).

'''Alternative comedy''' is a term coined in the 1980s for a style of [[comedy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Micro-epic of The Black Hole|last=Thomas|first=David|date=5 March 1982|work=The Times|page=v|quote= At a time when "alternative comedy" is increasingly showing itself to be little other than a more aggressive version of the old comedy, the National Theatre of Brent are offering a style that is entirely original.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/26/45/26_45piehole.html |title=The Brooklyn Paper: SERIOUS FUN |work=[[The Brooklyn Paper]] |author=Lisa Selin Davis |date=10 November 2003 |accessdate=30 October 2009 |quote=Alternative comedy is nothing new. The term gained fame in 1980s Britain, when out-of-the-ordinary sitcoms like ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' or ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' popped up, and continued in America with unorthodox sketch comedy groups such as Manhattan's [[Upright Citizen's Brigade]]. But, according to [Andrea Rosen of the 'Pie Hole Comedy Show' in Brooklyn, New York], alternative comedy predates all of those acts. '[[Mel Brooks]] was an alternative comic,' said Rosen, citing his famous [[2000 Year Old Man|2000-Year-Old Man]] routine. 'So is [[Steve Martin]].' And Rosen's influences also include old masters like filmmaker [[Woody Allen]], who started his career as a standup. 'There's a whole world of alternative comedy rooms, in bars and basements.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; that makes a conscious break with the [[mainstream]] comedic style of an era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Television Producers | author=Jeremy Tunstall | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b0RG7GBW7ooC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=%22alternative+comedy%22+define| page=127 | year=1993 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=0-415-09471-2 | quote='Alternative' comedy is inevitably difficult to define, not least because it tends, after an interval, to join the mainstream.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has had different connotations in different contexts: in the UK, it was used to describe content which was an "alternative" to the mainstream of live comedy, which often involved [[Racism|racist]] and [[Sexism|sexist]] material.&lt;ref name=Comedystore&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=William|title=The Comedy Store|year=2001|publisher=Little, Brown &amp; Company|isbn=0-316-85792-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other contexts, it is the nature of the form that is "alternative", avoiding reliance on a standardised structure of a sequence of [[joke]]s with [[punch line]]s. [[Patton Oswalt]] has defined it as "comedy where the audience has no pre-set expectations about the crowd, and vice versa. In comedy clubs, there tends to be a certain vibe—alternative comedy explores different types of material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://bostonguide.com/archives1/five_questions/index.php?url=patton%20oswalt.html |title= 5 questions with Patton Oswalt |work= Panorama Magazine|date= 5 May 2008|accessdate= 24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' after his performance in the 2011 [[comedy-drama]] film ''[[Young Adult (film)|Young Adult]]'', Oswalt stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had come up out of that whole alternative scene, which was all about, "Don’t try it, man. Just go up and wing it." I think a lot of that comes from insecurity. It's that fashion of improv and amateurism that comes from the insecurity of saying to the audience, "Well, it doesn't matter if it doesn't go well, because I didn’t even try that hard to begin with." It's like, "Oh, that's why you're not [trying]. If you actually tried hard and it sucked, then you've got to blame yourself." So that's what makes it hard for some people to sit down and actually just do the fucking work, because doing the work means you're making a commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.avclub.com/articles/patton-oswalt-on-his-most-memorable-roles-and-givi,88860/2/|title= Patton Oswalt on his most memorable roles and giving life advice to Dane Cook|work= The A.V.

==United Kingdom==
===Comedy Store===
The official history of London's [[Comedy Store, London|Comedy Store]] credits comedian and author [[Tony Allen (comedian)|Tony Allen]]&lt;ref name=Comedystore /&gt; with coining the term. However, in his autobiography, the late [[Malcolm Hardee]] claims to have coined the term in 1978.&lt;ref name="Hardee 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardee|first=Malcolm|title=I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake | year=1996 | publisher=Fourth Estate|isbn=0-09-188924-3|author2=Fleming, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative comedy came to describe an approach to [[stand-up comedy]] that was neither racist nor sexist but free-form and devised by the performers themselves. This style won out in a "civil war"&lt;ref name="Double"&gt;{{cite book|last=Double|first=Oliver|title=Stand Up, On Being a Comedian|year=1997|publisher=Methuen Drama|isbn=0-413-70320-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; against more traditional comedians who had, initially, also performed at London's Comedy Store, Dean Street, Soho, from its opening in May 1979. Traditional club comedians of the time often relied on jokes targeting women and minorities.&lt;ref name=Tenyears&gt;{{cite book|last=Connor|first=John|title=Ten Years of Alternative Comedy|year=1990|publisher=PAPERMAC|isbn=0-333-54171-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative comedy that developed from these clashes was more like comedy's answer to [[Punk rock|punk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Arthur|title=My Name is Daphne Fairfax|year=2009|publisher=Random House| isbn=978-0-09-951965-2 |page= 145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexei Sayle]], the Comedy Store's first [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]], provided angry character comedy satirising the left. Fellow MC Tony Allen broke the taboos of personal and sexual politics, while Keith Allen confronted audiences in a fearless{{tone-inline|date=November 2014}} series of "put-ons" and was a big influence on the early [[cabaret]] scene that was about to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Arthur|title=My Name is Daphne Fairfax|year=2009|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-09-951965-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these newer comics grew in confidence, Tony Allen and Alexi Sayle founded "Alternative Cabaret",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calcott|first=Andrew|title=The Rough Guide to British Cult Comedy|year=2006|publisher=Penguin Books Ltd|isbn=1-84353-618-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other Comedy Store regulars. Their aim was to establish several alternative comedy clubs in London in addition to their flagship venue at the [[Elgin (Ladbroke Grove)|Elgin]], Ladbroke Grove, from August 1979. Its core members were Jim Barclay, [[Andy De La Tour]], and [[Pauline Melville]], stand-ups who shared a background in radical fringe theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosengard|first=Peter|title= Didn't You Kill My Mother-in-Law?|year=1989|publisher=Methuen Drama |isbn=978-0-413-17390-4 |author2=Wilmot, Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair also brought alternative stand-up to the [[Edinburgh Festival]] for the first time in August 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sayle|first=Alexi|title=My Favourite Year|publisher=Sunday Independent |date = 3 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; with "Late Night Alternative" at the Heriot-Watt Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexeisayle.me/about-me/|title=Alexei Sayle - About Me|website=www.alexeisayle.me}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning with a full show in 1981, "Alternative Cabaret" was the critical comedy hit of that year.&lt;ref name=Tenyears/&gt;

===Alternative Cabaret===
The Comedy Store now advertised itself as "The Home of Alternative Comedy"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|title=London Listings|publisher=Time Out Ltd |date =1 January 1981 |pages= 60}}&lt;/ref&gt; in London's weekly Entertainment Guide, ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'', listing "Alternative Cabaret" as its main show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Time Out|title=London Listings|publisher=Time Out Ltd|date = 4 December 1981 | pages = 81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their tours established the idea of running comedy shows in small venues around London, and sowed the seeds of the network of pub-based gigs that grew in the capital and across the UK throughout the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Double"/&gt; The new comedy got its own section, "Cabaret", in Listings magazines, first in ''[[City Limits (magazine)|City Limits]]'' followed by ''Time Out'' on 21 January 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Time Out|title=London Listings|publisher=Time Out Ltd |date = 21 January 1983|pages= 69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organisations, comics, and entrepreneurs—including Maria Kempinska's [[Jongleurs]] and Roland and Clare Muldoon's CAST/New Variety—added more regular venues, bringing the number of gigs per week from 24 in 1983 to 69 by 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Time Out|title=London Listings|publisher=Time Out Ltd |date = 21 January 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Comic Strip===
Meanwhile, another group of comics left the Comedy Store with [[Peter Richardson (actor)|Peter Richardson]] to form [[The Comic Strip]] and run their own "Comedy Cabaret" shows at the Boulevard Theatre, Walkers Court, Soho in October 1980.&lt;ref name="Over21-1981"&gt;{{cite web | first=David | last=Johnson | title= Something Funny is Happening in Stripland | url= https://shapersofthe80s.com/seismic-shifts/1980-a-new-decade-demands-new-comedy/ |work=Over21, January issue, page 36, republished at Shapersofthe80s | location=London | accessdate=2018-04-07 |date=1981-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Comic Strip, featuring double acts and sketch comedy, consisted of [[University of Manchester|Manchester University]] and [[Central School of Speech and Drama|Royal Central School]] graduates [[Ade Edmondson]], [[Rik Mayall]], [[Nigel Planer]], [[Dawn French]], and [[Jennifer Saunders]], who began to aim their talents at television. As ''[[The Comic Strip|The Comic Strip Presents]]'', the group made over 40 television films for both [[Channel 4]] and [[BBC]].

[[Ben Elton]], who had by then become the Comedy Store's next MC, was invited by Rik Mayall to join him as co-writer of BBC2's TV hit sitcom ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]''. However, it was as MC of Channel 4's new comedy show ''[[Saturday Live (UK TV series)|Saturday Live]]'' that Elton found fame in his own right. As author William Cook noted, "After ''The Young Ones'' made him Alternative Comedy's hidden voice, ''Saturday Live'' (Channel 4) made him its most visible face."&lt;ref name=Comedystore/&gt;

Comic and broadcaster Arthur Smith observed that "If Tony Allen, 'The Godfather of Alternative Comedy', was the theory of anarchic comedy, then Malcolm Hardee was its cock-eyed embodiment".&lt;ref name=Tenyears/&gt; Hardee was the much loved MC at the Tunnel Palladium, The Mitre, Deptford 1984-89 whose audience were famous for their vocal participation and wit.{{tone-inline|date=November 2014}} There he influenced the early careers of [[Vic Reeves]] and [[Bob Mortimer]], [[Simon Day]], Chris Lynam, Martin Soan, [[Harry Enfield]], and many others to whom he gave their first gigs. He also found fame himself as part of [[The Greatest Show on Legs]], which had been started by Martin Soan, his part in the legendary "Naked Balloon Dance" as well as his many shows and pranks at The Edinburgh Festival.&lt;ref name="Hardee 1996"/&gt;

Just about every major British stand-up comedian in the last thirty years started their career in alternative comedy clubs, including Ben Elton, [[Jo Brand]], [[Jack Dee]], [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Harry Hill]], [[Peter Kay]], [[Jimmy Carr]], and [[Ross Noble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Double|first=Oliver|title=Getting The Joke| year=2005 |publisher=Methuen |isbn=0-413-77476-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary Alternative Comedy in the United Kingdom===
Alternative comedy has enjoyed a resurgence in the UK since about 2010, with [[Stewart Lee]] promoting the liberal, progressive values of the 1980's alternative comedy scene through his writing, live shows featuring veteran alternative comedians including [[Alexi Sayle]] and [[Norman Lovett]], as well as a [[Comedy Central]] tv series showcasing a great variety of alternative acts called [[The Alternative Comedy Experience]]. Younger acts have banded together into groups dedicated to alternative comedy, including [[The Alternative Comedy Memorial Society]] and [[Weirdos Comedy Club|The Weirdos Collective]].

==United States==

===New York City===
In New York City, much of what is called alternative or "downtown comedy"&lt;ref name=nyt2006&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/fashion/sundaystyles/29Comedy.html?ex=1296190800&amp;en=81d9e77f927d8fc5&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss |title=Alternative Comedy - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |author=Warren St. John |date=January 29, 2006 |accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is performed outside of traditional comedy clubs in theatres, such as [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] (UCB), [[Magnet Theater]], [[The Creek and The Cave]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/nyregion/the-creek-and-the-cave-serves-up-a-safe-harbor-for-improv.html?_r=0 |title=Behind Tacos, A Safe Haven for Comedy |publisher=nytimes.com |accessdate=June 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Peoples Improv Theater]] (PIT), as well as cabarets that host comedy only occasionally.  The comedians at these shows offer character-based humour or [[surreal humour]], as opposed to [[Observational comedy|observations of everyday life]] or more polemical themes.&lt;ref name="nyt20061"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/fashion/sundaystyles/29Comedy.html?pagewanted=all | title=Seinfeld It Ain't | date=January 29, 2006 | publisher=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate=2009-10-30| quote=Bars and back rooms in the East Village and Lower East Side are overflowing these days with the likes of Adolf Dice Hitler Clay: not spoofs of Nazis necessarily, but rather a wave of young and creative comics who are branching out from straight stand-up to eccentric sketch and character-based humor that owes more to ''[[Da Ali G Show]]'' than to [[George Carlin]]....Any attempt to define the term alternative comedy was doomed, [Andrés] du Bouchet said before his Tuesday night show, but he gave it a shot anyway. "Alternative is a catchall phrase for 'not [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]],' " he said.  Aziz Ansari, 22 and an up-and-coming comic on the scene, elaborated. "The alternative rooms give you an outlet to explore something other than straight stand-up," he said. "You can do characters. I can bring a girl on stage that I got rejected by and interview her, or do a [[PowerPoint]] presentation or show a short film. The nature of the venues allows you to experiment." | first=Warren | last=St. John}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many alternative comics such as [[Demetri Martin]] and Slovin and [[Leo Allen|Allen]] use unusual presentation styles, opting to play music, give [[Powerpoint]] presentations, or act out sketches.&lt;ref name="nyt2006"/&gt; Many alternative comics such as [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Janeane Garofalo]], and [[Todd Barry]] also perform in mainstream comedy venues. The now-defunct [[Luna Lounge]] in New York's [[Lower East Side]] was home to a celebrated weekly alternative comedy stand-up series called "Eating It" from 1995 to 2005, co-created by Garofalo, which featured a changing line-up including [[Louis CK]], [[Jim Norton (American comedian)|Jim Norton]], [[Ted Alexandro]], [[Todd Barry]], [[H. Jon Benjamin]], [[Greg Giraldo]], [[Patrice O'Neal]], [[Patton Oswalt]], [[Sarah Vowell]], [[Mike Birbiglia]], [[Marc Maron]], [[Dave Chappelle]], [[Roseanne Barr]], [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Janeane Garofalo]], and numerous others, until the property was sold and the building razed.

Eugene Mirman started a show called Invite Them up at Rififi, a bar in New York’s East Village in 2002. The popular weekly show, co-hosted by Bobby Tisdale, never advertised or listed its performers. Comedians such as Demetri Martin, Aziz Ansari, Pete Holmes, Jon Glazer, Jon Daly, Reggie Watts and musicians such as Bright Eyes and Yo La Tengo all performed on Invite Them Up. The show spurred a host of other weekly events at Rififi hosted by Nick Kroll, Jon Mulaney, Greg Johnson, Larry Murphy and Jenny Slate. The venue was a hotbed of alternative comedy until complaints from neighbors about one of Rififi’s dance parties, Trash, got the bar closed down in 2008.

Warren St. John said that the "inspiration" for alternative comedy in New York City is the [[Upright Citizens Brigade]]. The group originally formed at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in Chelsea in 1999.&lt;ref name=nyt2006/&gt; Four years later, in 2003, several performers at the UCB spun off their own theater, and formed the PIT. St. John also argues that one reason why unusual comics can succeed in New York City is that they don't have to tour part-time, as many of them also work as writers on local comedy television shows such as ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.&lt;ref name=nyt2006/&gt;

===Los Angeles===

Patton Oswalt cited [[Dana Gould]] as the originator of the alternative comedy scene in the early nineties, who also cites [[Janeane Garofalo]] as another progenitor of the scene. [[Beth Lapides]] started the [[Un-Cabaret]] shows, which was the flagship of the alternative comedy movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gothamist.com/2006/12/27/dana_gould_writ.php|title=Dana Gould, Writer and Comedian|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206060656/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/27/dana_gould_writ.php|archivedate=2013-12-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other contemporaries of the scene included [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[David Cross]], [[Greg Behrendt]], [[Andy Kindler]], and [[Kathy Griffin]].&lt;ref&gt;Nerdist Podcast with Dana Gould&lt;/ref&gt;

Oswalt was essential in pioneering the alternative comedy on the West Coast. He created [[The Comedians of Comedy]] tour, which played across the US in independent music venues intermittently from 2004 to 2008. The original tour was hosted by Oswalt, and featured [[Maria Bamford]], [[Zach Galifianakis]], and [[Brian Posehn]].

==Canada==

Canada has a rich history of embracing alternative stand-up and sketch comedy. [[The ALTdot COMedy Lounge]] has been running for more than 20 years at [[The Rivoli]], where "oddball outsiders" [[The Kids in the Hall]] also had a residency in the mid-1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/art-and-books/books/kids-in-the-hall-and-the-rivoli/ - How the Kids in the Hall pioneered an alt-comedy scene at The Rivoli|website=NOW Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Other notable alternative comedy shows now defunct included ''Pirate Video Cabaret'' (ended 2003), ''Laugh Sabbath'' and [[The Second City Theater Toronto]]'s ''Sketchy at Best''. Other notable alt acts include Terry Clement, [[Sean Cullen]], [[Jon Dore]], Paul Irving, [[Chris Locke]], [[Levi Macdougall]], [[Ron Sparks (comedian)|Ron Sparks]] and [[Harland Williams]].

==South Africa==

While South African comedy often comprises racial or [[stereotype]]-based humour, alternative comedy in South Africa tends to avoid such subject matter. It is hard to define alternative comedy, but subject matter may include taboo, dark, non sequitur, geek, and various other topics, whilst excluding racial, scatological, stereotype, South Africanised humour and other topics considered mainstream. Although comedians of this genre may include mainstream topics, it does not form the majority of their sets.

It is hard to say exactly where it started, but The Underground in Melville Johannesburg was known for its risqué humour proliferated by founder [[John Vlismas]]. The Comedy Underground&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel24.co.za/Columnists/Rob-van-Vuuren/The-Comedy-underground-is-dead-20110927|title=The Comedy Underground is dead!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was fertile development ground for alternative humour with its anything goes policy. Since its closure in 2010, alternative comedy has found new venues including [[Foxwood theatre]], Picollinos, and various others. Johannesburg remains the home of South African alternative.

One of the driving forces behind the increasing prominence of alternative comedy is the Johannesburg Comedy Cartel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joburg.co.za/|title=Joburg.co.za - Events, Restaurants &amp; Bars, Accommodation Guide|website=Joburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose members include [[Shaun Wewege]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whacked.co.za/index.php/mcs/item/shaun-wewege Shaun Wewege] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130421234255/http://www.whacked.co.za/index.php/mcs/item/shaun-wewege |date=2013-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warren Robertson]], [[Vittorio Leonardi]], and [[Alyn Adams]]. Other South African comedians who fall into the genre include [[Dale Amler]], [[Roni Modimola]], Mark Banks, and Vlismas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2010-05-27-john-vlismas-on-the-post-fifa-apocalypse-sepp-blatter-and-helen-zille|title=John Vlismas on the post-Fifa apocalypse, Sepp Blatter and Helen Zille - Daily Maverick|website=dailymaverick.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mel Miller (comedian)|Mel Miller]] is arguably considered one of the pioneers of the alternative genre in South Africa. During the [[Apartheid]] era, Miller's material was considered "inappropriate" or radical, resulting in more than one run-in and detention with the [[South African Bureau of State Security]].

'''Antonio Blitz''' (born in [[Deal, Kent]], England, 21 June 1810; died in [[Philadelphia]], United States,  28 January 1877) was an English [[Magic (illusion)|magician]], who worked mainly in Europe and the United States.

==Biography==
At 13 years of age, he began his career in [[Hamburg]], Germany. After traveling for two years in northern Europe, he returned to England, appearing first in [[Dover]] in December 1825. He then visited Ireland and Scotland. In 1834, he went to the United States, and, after performing in New York City, traveled throughout that country. Later he visited Canada and the [[West Indies]]. On his return from the south he settled in Philadelphia, where he resided until his death.{{sfn|Wilson &amp; Fiske|1900}}

Appaloosa had 100 employees as of January 2001, and had produced over 150 video games up to that point, many of which were released in Europe. At that time, Friedman said, "In all the years we have been in business, we have only failed to complete a project because of our own inability once or twice."&lt;ref name=NG/&gt; Appaloosa's final game was ''[[Jaws Unleashed]]'', released in 2006, and based on the ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' series of films.

'''As Seen On TV''' is a generic nameplate for products advertised on television in the [[United States]] for direct-response mail-order through a [[toll-free telephone number]]. ''As Seen On TV'' advertisements, known as [[infomercial]]s, are usually 30-minute shows or two-minute spots during commercial breaks. These products can range from kitchen, household, automotive, cleaning, health, and beauty products, to exercise and fitness products, books, or to toys and games for children. Typically the packaging for these items includes a standardized red seal in the shape of a [[CRT television]] screen with the words "AS SEEN ON TV" in white, an intentional allusion to the logo of ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Prominent marketers of ''As Seen On TV'' products include As Seen On TV, Inc., [[Time-Life]], Space Bag, [[K-tel]], [[Ronco]], and Thane. There are also retail [[brick-and-mortar]] and online stores that specifically sell ''As Seen On TV'' products.&lt;ref name=ASOTV&gt;{{cite book |author=Lou Harry, Sam Stall |title=As Seen on TV: 50 Amazing Products and the Commercials That Made Them Famous |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8_sMBcCVqEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22as+seen+on+tv%22&amp;sig=ACfU3U3RO4Vofw5JN88lIbnrFUFGEzJYFg |year=2002 |publisher=Quirk Books |isbn=1-931686-09-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s "As Seen On TV" then moved on to retail, according to A.J. Khubani, CEO of [[Telebrands]], who designed the logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pitch Perfect |url=http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2010/01/01/05 |quote=He figured out that he could build brand recognition by blanketing the airwaves with cheap direct-to-consumer commercials, and then take the product into retail stores where he slapped an "As Seen On TV" logo on them, which he designed himself. It’s a very lucrative formula, he told me, so that’s what he’s been doing ever since. |work=[[On The Media]] |date=January 1, 2010 |accessdate=2010-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109131420/http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2010/01/01/05 |archivedate=2010-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''As Seen On TV'' products then moved on to sell on the internet. In 2015, a new ''As Seen On TV'' corporation was formed and launched as a multi-vendor marketplace, allowing manufacturers and sellers of TV products to sell their inventory through its website New Easy.

The red logo and phrase is now in the [[public domain]] and can be used on packaging or used in business with no fee and without trademark infringement.&lt;ref&gt;Ad Track: Marketers bet on lucky 777; that's July 7, 2007 https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2007-05-29-ad-track-lucky_N.htm Q: Does someone own the famous ad phrase "As Seen On TV" or the familiar logo that has that phrase in a TV-shaped red box?&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies that produce generic versions of ''As Seen On TV'' products may use a modified version of the red logo, their version displaying "Like on TV" or "As Seen On TV in some countries". This logo can be registered in some countries like a trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Ad Track: http://www.wipo.int/cgi-mad/guest/ifetch5?ENG+MADRID-FULL.vdb+11-00+41311751-KEY+256+0+772321+BASICHTML-ENG+1+1+1+25+SEP-0/HITNUM,PN,MAR,,,IMAGE+MAR%2f%22AS+SEEN+ON+TV%22+&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cinematography]], '''butterflies''' (also known as '''overheads''') are structures on which materials are mounted so to control lighting in a [[theatrical scenery|scene]] or [[photograph]]. Materials commonly used on butterflies include: [[flag (lighting)|flags]] (black, opaque materials), nets (layers of neutral-colored [[bobbinet|bobinette]]), and [[diffuse reflection|diffusion]]s  (translucent white materials of different densities) for the purposes of blocking, dimming, and scattering light respectively. In general, butterflies are used only for very large materials (6&amp;nbsp;ft x 6&amp;nbsp;ft or greater), while smaller sizes are usually sewn on to &lt;!-- onto? --&gt; portable frames (similar in construction to [[picture frame]]s) for ease of placement and storage.

== Use in Industry ==
In industry, butterflies are often called for by their dimensions, which are standard: 6&amp;nbsp;ft. x 6&amp;nbsp;ft, 8x8, 12x12, and 20x20. The materials themselves tend to be created at smaller sizes—usually about 8&amp;nbsp;inches less in each dimension—so as order to ensure a flat, stretched surface when mounted on the butterfly. 

While portable frames usually consist of light-blocking and scattering materials (flags, nets, and diffusions), butterflies may also be rigged with reflective materials such as silver lame for redirecting light.

== Background ==
{{Main|Viacom (original)}}
[[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] was created in 1971 as the television [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] division of [[CBS]], and was spun off in 1971. However, in 1999, Viacom acquired its former parent, by this time also named CBS Corporation, formerly [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]]. The prior CBS Corporation also owned [[Country Music Television|CMT]] and [[Spike (TV channel)|The Nashville Network]] (now [[Paramount Network]]), which remained Viacom properties after the 2005 split, but the prior CBS did not own [[UPN]], Showtime, Paramount Television, Paramount Parks, or Simon and Schuster.

== History ==
{{Prose|section|date=February 2017}}
In March 2005, Viacom announced plans of looking into splitting the company into two publicly traded companies, amid issues of the stock price stagnating (although it was alleged that another main force behind the split was the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy]]{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}, which led to MTV not being allowed to produce any more halftime shows, they had also produced the show for [[Super Bowl XXXV]], the first Super Bowl CBS aired since regaining [[NFL]] rights and becoming MTV's corporate sibling).

[[File:Viacom-old.svg|thumb|Old separate [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] logo (1990-2006).]]

On June 14, 2005, the Viacom Board of Directors approved the split of the company into two firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/15/business/media/15viacom.html|title=viacom board agres to split of company|last=Fabrikant |first=Geraldine|date=June 15, 2005|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBS Corporation name would be revived for one of the companies, to be headed by longtime television executive (and Viacom co-President) [[Leslie Moonves]], and would include CBS, UPN, Infinity Broadcasting, Viacom Outdoor, Showtime Networks, and Paramount's television studio.

The split was structured such that [[Viacom|the new Viacom]] was spun off from the old Viacom, which was renamed CBS Corporation. In a sense, this was a repeat of the 1971 spinoff. However, in this case, CBS retained virtually all of the prior firm's broadcast TV assets, including its various syndication companies.

With the split, the two new companies began trading on the NYSE on January 3, 2006. Investors anticipated Viacom benefiting from the split, but instead, it dropped approximately 20 percent, while CBS rose 9 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/22/business/media/22viacom.html?pagewanted=all|title=a surprise after the spli: viacom struggles as cbs holds its own|last=Fabrikant|first=Geraldine|date=July 22, 2006|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Announced in January 2006, CBS and [[DIC Entertainment]] signed a multi-year deal in which DIC bought the Saturday morning airtime as "CBS's Saturday Morning Secret Slumber Party". In June 2006, DiC added a production partner AOL's KOL. Thus, this block would be called "[[Cookie Jar TV|KOL's Saturday Morning Secret Slumber Party on CBS]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John |last=Consoli |url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/networktv/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002725721 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713195740/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/networktv/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002725721 |archivedate=July 13, 2006 |title=DIC, KOL to Produce On CBS |date=June 21, 2006 |publisher=MediaWeek |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The CW.svg|right|200px|thumb|The CW logo]]
On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation, and [[Warner Bros.]] announced that they were to create a new broadcast network, [[The CW|The CW Television Network]]. The network officially debuted on September 18, 2006. The network formally debuted on September 20 with the 2 hour premiere of [[America's Next Top Model]]. The network is the result of a merger of [[The WB]] (a Warner Bros. holding) and [[UPN]] (a CBS Corporation holding). CBS Corporation and Time Warner each own 50% of the network. [[Tribune Broadcasting]] (which previously owned a 25% stake on The WB) and CBS Corporation will contribute its stations as new network affiliates.

Three days after the announcement of The CW, on January 27, CBS announced that it was selling its [[Paramount Parks]] division. On May 23, 2006, CBS Corporation sold Paramount Parks to the [[Cedar Fair Entertainment Company]]. With this acquisition, Cedar Fair became the third-largest theme park operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=News|first1=Bloomberg|title=CBS to Sell Amusement Parks to Cedar Fair|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/business/23park.html|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 30, 2006, Cedar Fair announced that it has completed its acquisition of Paramount Parks from CBS Corporation in a cash transaction valued at US$1.24 billion.  The transaction included a 10-year license that allowed Cedar Fair to use the Paramount name in the parks through the 2017 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=L.P.|first1=Cedar Fair,|title=Cedar Fair, L.P.

===Postponed re-merger with Viacom===
In September 29, 2016, [[National Amusements]] sent a letter to the company and [[Viacom]], encouraging the two companies to merge back into one company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/national-amusements-calls-viacom-cbs-933705|title=National Amusements Proposes Viacom, CBS Reunion, Cites "Substantial Synergies"|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 12, the deal was called off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shari Redstone withdraws CBS-Viacom merger proposal|url=https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2016/12/12/shari-redstone-withdraws-cbs-viacom-merger-proposal.html|accessdate=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 12, 2018, [[CNBC]] reported that Viacom had re-entered talks to merge back into CBS Corporation, after [[Proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|Disney's proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets]] and the heavy competition from companies such as [[Netflix]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/12/viacom-shares-jump-9-percent-percent-on-wrap-report-that-its-looking-to-merge-with-cbs.html|title=Viacom, CBS shares surge after report Shari Redstone pursuing merge of companies|last=Wang|first=Christine|date=January 12, 2018|work=CNBC|access-date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, it was reported that the combined company could be a suitor for acquiring the film studio [[Lionsgate]] (which currently handles U.S distribution and global sales for [[CBS Films]]&lt;ref name="Penske Business Media"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lionsgate Takes Over CBS Films’ Distribution &amp; Global Sales|url=http://deadline.com/2014/11/cbs-films-lionsgate-distribution-sales-partnership-1201283340/|accessdate=November 13, 2014|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=Penske Business Media|date=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2018/01/lionsgate-talks-amazon-verizon-cbs-viacom-1202244991/|title=Lionsgate Ripe For Takeover As Amazon, Verizon and CBS-Viacom Emerge As Potential Suitors|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2018, CBS made an all-stock offer slightly below Viacom's market value, and insisting that its existing leadership, including long-time chairman and CEO [[Leslie Moonves]], oversee the re-combined company. Viacom rejected the offer as being too low, requesting an increase by $2.8 billion, and requesting that Bob Bakish be maintained as president and COO under Moonves. It was reported these conflicts had resulted from Shari Redstone seeking more control over CBS and its leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/moonves-redstone-inside-poisonous-war-control-cbs-viacom-1101570|title=Moonves vs. Redstone: Inside the Poisonous War for Control of CBS and Viacom|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/cbs-viacom-leslie-moonves-2-1202749787/|title=Could CBS-Viacom Strife Cause Leslie Moonves to Walk Away?|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=April 11, 2018|work=Variety|access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, on May 14, 2018, CBS Corporation sued its and Viacom's parent company National Amusements and accused Shari Redstone of abusing her voting power in it and [[Hostile takeover|forcing a merger that was not supported by it or Viacom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-14/cbs-sues-redstone-s-nai-to-let-board-meeting-on-dividend-happen|title=CBS Sues Redstones' Firm in Escalation of Longstanding Fight|date=May 14, 2018|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2018/05/shari-redstones-national-amusements-outraged-cbs-suit-1202390493/|title=National Amusements Fires Back At CBS Suit, Says It’s "Outraged" By Allegations|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn C.|date=May 14, 2018|work=Deadline|access-date=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS also accused Redstone of discouraging [[Verizon Communications]] from acquiring it, which could have been beneficial to its shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deadline.com/2018/05/verizon-expressed-interest-acquiring-cbs-before-viacom-talks-heated-up-1202390751/amp/|title=Verizon Expressed Interest In Acquiring CBS Before Viacom Talks Heated Up

On May 23, Leslie Moonves stated that he considered the Viacom channels to be an "albatross," and while he favored more content for [[CBS All Access]], he believed that there were better deals for CBS than the Viacom deal, such as [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], Lionsgate or [[Sony Pictures|Sony Pictures Entertainment]]. Moonves also considered Bakish a threat as he never wanted an ally of Shari Redstone as a board member of the combined company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/news/behind-leslie-moonves-crusade-save-cbs-viacom-1114203|title=Behind Leslie Moonves' Crusade to Save CBS From Viacom|last=Bond|first=Paul|date=May 23, 2018|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 9, 2018, following Moonves' resignation due to sexual harassment allegations, National Amusements agreed to defer any proposal of a CBS-Viacom merger for at least two years after the date of the settlement. In addition, the office of chairman will remain vacant until a new permanent CEO is appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/les-moonves-accused-sex-crimes-violence-by-more-women-1141436|title=Leslie Moonves Exits CBS After Being Accused of Sex Crimes, Violence by More Women|last=Parker|first=Ryan|date=2018-09-09|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cabbage Patch Kids''' are a line of [[Soft sculpture|soft sculptured]] toy doll like creatures sold by [[Xavier Roberts]] and registered in the United States copyright office in 1978. 

The doll brand was one of the most popular toy [[fad]]s of the 1980s and one of the longest-running doll franchises in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Top 10 Toy Crazes|work= Time|date=2009-12-14|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1947621_1947626_1947588,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characters appeared in many other Cabbage Patch merchandising products ranging from animated cartoons to record albums to board games.

==Production history==

===Creation and development===
According to Roberts, as a 21-year-old art student, he utilized the quilting skills he learned from his mother and the historic technique of "needle molding" to develop his own line of fabric sculptures. He called these hand-stitched, one-of-a-kind, soft fabric sculptures "The Little People". (Other soft sculpture dolls dating back to the 19th century were created using similar needle molding techniques.) His Little People were not offered for sale, but were "adopted" each with their own individual name and birth certificate.  Instead of paying a purchase price, buyers of Little People would have to pay an adoption fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/parenting/the-cabbage-patch-kids-twisted-history-117266351832.html|title=The Cabbage Patch Kids' Twisted History|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Little People were first sold at arts and crafts shows, then later at [[Babyland General Hospital]], an old medical clinic that Roberts and his friends-turned-employees converted into a toy store, in [[Cleveland, Georgia]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabbagepatchkids.com/pages/History_folklore/Milestones/milestones.html |title=Our History |accessdate=February 22, 2008 |publisher=Babyland General Hospital |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218053854/http://www.cabbagepatchkids.com/pages/History_folklore/Milestones/milestones.html |archivedate=February 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early transaction at Babyland General Hospital worth noting is the sale of the only Little People quintuplets ever made at the facility.  Bennie and Jeannie Shelton of Cumming, Georgia paid $5,000 to buy the one-of-a-kind set of five identical dolls.  Also worth noting is one of Roberts' very first Little People dolls he ever created sold at an auction in Virginia in the early 1980s for $3,000.

The following is an abbreviated version of the origin story Roberts came up with for his Little People:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;'''Xavier Roberts''' was a ten-year-old boy who discovered the Cabbage Patch Kids by following a BunnyBee behind a waterfall into a magical Cabbage Patch, where he found the Cabbage Patch babies being born. To help them find good homes he built BabyLand General in Cleveland, Georgia where the Cabbage Patch Kids could live and play until they were adopted.

'''BunnyBees''' are bee-like creatures with rabbit ears they use as wings. They pollinate cabbages with their magic crystals to make Cabbage Patch babies.

'''Colonel Casey''' is a large stork who oversees Babyland General Hospital. He's the narrator of the Cabbage Patch Kids' story.

'''Otis Lee''' is the leader of the gang of Cabbage Patch Kids that befriended Xavier.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(This discovery legend would be reproduced on every Cabbage Patch Kids product from 1983 onward.)

===Coleco years===
The name change to Cabbage Patch Kids was made in 1982 when Xavier's company, Original Appalachian Artworks, began to license a smaller version of the handmade creations to a toy manufacturer named [[Coleco]] which began mass production the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessnorthga.com/detail.php?n=213040&amp;c=10|title=Cleveland's Cabbage Patch Kids turn 25|publisher=AccessNorthGA.com|date=2008-09-07|accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coleco Cabbage Patch Kids had large, round [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] heads (originally of a different, hard plastic), and soft fabric bodies, and were produced from 1982 to 1989, many at a factory in [[Amsterdam, New York]]. The first two years production was all from the Far East, with nine head variations produced and computer-matched with bodies to ensure each doll was "different". It was, in fact, a marketing ploy that worked quite well as a wide range of variations resulted. (Source: Larry Moniz, then senior account supervisor for the Coleco account at Richard Weiner Public Relations in NYC.)

At the peak of their popularity, the dolls were a must-have [[toy]] for [[Christmas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Booming Sales in Toyland |work= Time|date=1984-12-10 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955377,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-03 | first1=John S. | last1=DeMott | first2=Other | last2=Bureaus | first3=Rosemary | last3=Byrnes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= TOYS: Trouble in the Cabbage Patch|work=Time|date=1988-05-16 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967387,00.html |accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents across the [[United States]] flocked to stores to try to obtain one of the Cabbage Patch Kids for their children, with fights occasionally erupting between parents over the hard-to-find dolls. In later years, Coleco introduced variants on the original Cabbage Patch Kids, and derivatives of the original line of dolls continued to be marketed.

===International variations===
In the 1980s when [[Coleco]] was producing the dolls for the North American market, the global craze was fulfilled by other companies:
* Jesmar Toy Company made the dolls for the European Market, Including Spain, Italy and Germany.
* Lili Ledy Toy Company made the dolls for Mexico and South America.
* Triang-Pedigree Toy Company made the dolls for South Africa.
* Tsukuda Toy Company manufactured the dolls for Japan and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mycpkcollection.weebly.com/cpk-info.html |title=Collector information, identification - My Cabbage Patch Kids |publisher=Mycpkcollection.weebly.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Dolls manufactured by each of these companies, and along with the factories that produced the dolls for North America, produced dolls that were slightly different from one another. Dolls that were made for consumers in other countries than the United States hold a higher value in the eye of some American collectors.

===Hasbro years===
[[Hasbro]] took over the rights to produce Cabbage Patch dolls in 1988 after Coleco filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy,&lt;ref name=coleco-chapter11&gt;{{cite news|title= Cabbage Patch Doll Maker Is Bankrupt |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1988-07-12|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-12/news/mn-5746_1_cabbage-patch-kids|accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to make the dolls with various gimmicks, including dolls that played [[kazoo]]s. Some of the more popular doll lines to come out under the Cabbage Patch Kids name included the "Birthday Kids", "Splash 'n' Tan Kids", and "Pretty Crimp and Curl". Hasbro gradually began making the dolls for younger children, which led to smaller and smaller dolls.  Although Cabbage Patch dolls were still best selling toys, Hasbro never really revitalized the Cabbage Patch market. In 1994, [[Mattel]] acquired the licensing rights to the dolls from Original Appalachian Artworks.
{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Mattel years===
In 1994, Mattel took over the Cabbage Patch [[brand]], including production. The first Mattel Cabbage Patch dolls hit the stores in 1995.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The Mattel Cabbage Patch dolls are not limited to cloth bodies and included dolls made from [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], which produced a more durable play doll. The Mattel dolls are mostly sized 14" or smaller, and most variants were individualized with a [[gimmick]] to enhance their collectibility, e.g. some dolls played on water-toys, swam, ate food, or brushed their teeth.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Some memorable Mattel lines include the updated Kids line of basic cloth dolls that came with [[birth certificates]], the OlympiKids that were made to coincide with the [[1996 Olympics]], and the Cabbage Patch [[Flower|Fairies]]. Additionally, to celebrate the dolls' 15th anniversary, Mattel created a line of exclusively female dolls with a new molded fabric face, dressed in a custom outfits and packaged in collectible boxes. These were 16 inches tall, the same measurement of the first Coleco Cabbage Patch Kids.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Toys "R" Us Kids===
In 2001, retailer [[Toys "R" Us]] took over the Cabbage Patch brand from Mattel, producing 20-inch Kids and 18-inch babies, both with cloth bodies and vinyl heads. They were packaged in cardboard [[cabbage leaf]] seats. In 2001, the 20-inch dolls debuted in the [[Times Square]] flagship store. These were created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the line, and were available both [[online]] and in stores around the US.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Play Along Toys===
The Toys "R" Us line lasted until [[Play Along]] toys obtained exclusive licensing rights to produce the Cabbage Patch Kids doll line. In 2003, Play Along launched a Cabbage Patch Kids 25th Anniversary collection using some of the original head sculpts from the very first Coleco editions. Play Along also partnered with [[Carvel Ice Cream]] in a co-branding campaign.  The resulting co-branded Cabbage Patch Kids  were packaged with  a Carvel-branded ice cream cone.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Jakks Pacific===
JAKKS Pacific acquired Play Along Toys and assumed  the master toy licensee (c2011) for the Cabbage Patch Kids.  Jakks introduced a 14-inch Cabbage Patch Kids Fashionality(TM) line and other Cabbage Patch Kid products. In 2013 Jakks Pacific released the Celebration edition to commemorate the 30th Birthday of the licensed Cabbage Patch Kids. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Wicked Cool Toys===
Wicked Cool Toys is now the current master toy licensee for the Cabbage Patch Kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2015/02/10/wicked-cool-toys-adopts-cabbage-patch-kids/ |title=Archive » Wicked Cool Toys adopts Cabbage Patch Kids |publisher=Kidscreen |date=2015-02-10 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this line, WCT released new additions like Little Sprouts, a toyline of tiny collectable dolls, and Adoptimals, plush pets who interact with the Kids.

==Cabbage Patch Kids brand==
The original 1982 Cabbage Patch Kids [[license agreement]] with Coleco Industries was negotiated  by Roger L. Schlaifer on behalf of Schlaifer Nance &amp; Company, the exclusive worldwide licensing agent for Roberts' company at the time.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Following Schlaifer Nance &amp; Company's signing of Coleco Industries, SN&amp;C signed over one hundred and fifty licenses for branded products ranging from the first children's licensed character [[diapers]] and low-sugar cereal to clothing, backyard pools, and thousands of other children's products — generating over $2 billion in retail sales for 1984, alone. Total sales during the Schlaifers' tenure exceeded $4.5 billion. While sales of the dolls and other licensed products declined precipitously in the late 1980s, the dolls have become a mainstay of the toy industry, and one of the few long-running doll brands in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abYKXvCwEToC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=cabbage+patch+kids+4.5+billion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jGzcuD2oLr&amp;sig=PJB4oxSbSdj84zxeN7tHOt6suHo&amp;hl=lv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8wP7LkOzOAhVnMJoKHXPqA5oQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cabbage%20patch%20kids%204.5%20billion&amp;f=false|title=Harry Potter: The Story of a Global Business Phenomenon|publisher=Susan Gunelius|accessdate=August 31, 2016|isbn=978-0-230-59410-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Porcelain Cabbage Patch Kids==
These dolls were available by [[direct mail]] from the [[Danbury Mint]]. They have a rigid fabric body with [[porcelain]] legs, arms, and head.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Talking Cabbage Patch Kids==
An extension to the line was the "Talking Cabbage Patch Kid" introduced by Coleco, equipped with a voice chip, touch sensors, a microphone, short range 49&amp;nbsp;MHz AM transmitter and receiver for communicating with other such dolls. Touch sensors in the hands enabled the toy to detect when and how it was being played with in response to its vocalizations. For example, the doll might say "hold my hand" and give an appropriate speech response when the touch sensor in either hand detected pressure. It also had a movement detector to show the positioning of the doll and whether it was sensed to be on its belly, back, or even upside down. A special plastic 'drinking' cup containing a hidden magnet, which could be identified with the aid a small reed relay in the built into the head of the toy above the mouth, to signify when it should be seen to be 'drinking'. A more remarkable effect occurred when one doll detected the presence of another through its 49&amp;nbsp;MHz AM transmitter/receiver. The dolls were programmed to signal their "awareness" of each other with a short phrase, e.g. "I think there's someone else to play with here!", and then to initiate simple conversations ''between the dolls themselves'' with enough randomness to sound somewhat natural. The joint synchronised singing of 'rounds' being particularly impressive. The inclusion of the microphone was to delay the search and communication with another of its type when the ambient noise was above a certain level.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Babyland General Hospital==
[[Babyland General Hospital]] is the "birthplace" of Cabbage Patch Kids and is located in [[Cleveland, Georgia]]. Roberts converted an old clinic into a "hospital" from which to sell his dolls, originally called "Little People". The facility is presented as a [[birth]]ing, [[Nursery (room)|nursery]], and [[adoption]] center for the Cabbage Patch Kids. In accordance with the theme, employees dress and act the parts of the doctors and nurses caring for the dolls as if they are real. Babyland General moved to a new facility on the outskirts of Cleveland, Georgia in 2010 and has been voted one of the Travel Channel's top 10 toylands.

=== Lawsuits ===
Though Xavier Roberts is the creator of the Cabbage Patch Kids brand, many of the brand's defining characteristics, such as the dolls' overly round faces and that they came with an [[adoption]] certificate, can be traced back to Martha Nelson Thomas, an American folk artist from [[Kentucky]]. Before Roberts ever became involved in the toy industry, Thomas created and marketed her own line of dolls, called Doll Babies, which she sold at local arts and craft shows and markets. The two crossed paths at a state fair in 1976 and Roberts began purchasing her dolls to sell at a profit at his own store in Georgia. &lt;ref&gt;"The Secret History of Cabbage Patch Dolls" May 10, 2015 Vice.https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8gk4dk/the-secret-history-of-cabbage-patch-kids-011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piro, Lauren."The Not-So-Sweet Truth About Cabbage Patch Kids: Behind those iconic chubby cheeks is a disappointing story" Apr 21, 2015.

She and her husband, Tucker Thomas, told the press that she was more upset by the corruption of her dolls, for which she cared deeply, than the money she'd lost as the result of Roberts' actions.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Joyce, Fay S.

Then Xavier Roberts himself brought a $30 million lawsuit against [[Topps]], the company that produced grotesque trading cards parodying his company's dolls called the [[Garbage Pail Kids]], for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Copyrights: Trouble in the Garbage Pail|work= Time|date=1986-03-17|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960905,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AROUND THE NATION; Judge Rules in Case Of Garbage Pail Kids|work=The New York Times|date=1986-08-30|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/30/us/around-the-nation-judge-rules-in-case-of-garbage-pail-kids.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Cabbage%20Pail%20Kids&amp;st=cse|accessdate= 2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, in the midst of the legal proceedings, the makers of the Garbage Pail Kids announced their decision to cease [[parodying]] the Cabbage Patch Kids, to which Roberts commented to the press "I could scream I'm so excited."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/02/03/Garbage-Pail-Kids-will-stop-mocking-Cabbage-Patch-Kids/9258539326800/|title=Garbage Pail Kids will stop mocking Cabbage Patch Kids|work=UPI|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Product safety ===
One line of Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, the Cabbage Patch Snacktime Kids, was designed to "eat" plastic snacks. The mechanism enabling this was a pair of one-way smooth metal rollers behind plastic lips. The snacks would exit the doll's back and "magically" appear into a backpack. The mechanism could be de-activated by releasing the backpack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=$40 Refund Is Offered for Hair-Eating Dolls|work=The New York Times|date=1997-01-07|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/07/us/40-refund-is-offered-for-hair-eating-dolls.html?scp=2&amp;sq=cabbage%20patch%20kids&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were extremely popular during Christmas 1996. The line was voluntarily withdrawn from the market following an agreement between Mattel and the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] in January 1997 following several incidents where children got their fingers or hair stuck in the dolls' mouths leading to safety warnings from Connecticut's [[consumer protection]] commissioner, Mark Shiffrin.&lt;ref name=cpsc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/PRHTML97/97055.html|title=Mattel and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Announce Voluntary Refund Program for Cabbage Patch Kids &amp; Snacktime Kids Dolls|date=1997-01-06|accessdate=February 22, 2008|publisher=United States [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220001659/http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/PRHTML97/97055.html#|archive-date=2008-02-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eagle News''', formerly known as '''Eagle TV''' ({{lang-mn|Ийгл Телевиз}} ''Iigl Televiz'') is a [[television]] broadcaster in [[Mongolia]]. The station focuses on independent news, uncensored live audience feedback, and, formerly, Protestant Christian programming.

== History ==
From 1994 to 2002 Eagle Television was operated on terrestrial Channel 8 by Mongolian Broadcasting Company (MBC). MBC was a joint venture of the American nonprofit, AMONG Foundation, and Mongolia Media Corporation (MMC). Incumbent [[President of Mongolia|Mongolian President]] [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj]]-then well known Mongolian democracy leader and a Member of Parliament helped to create Mongolia's first independent TV station Eagle Television in 1994.&lt;ref name="Facts on File"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elbegdorj, Tsakhiagiin|url=http://www.fofweb.com/WGCO/CapitalDisplay.aspx?Type=c&amp;iPin=atlasb239|publisher=Facts on File|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the American [[Tom Terry (author)|Tom Terry]] took over the management of MBC and Eagle TV.

Terry moved to transform the TV station’s struggling news and Christian programming in keeping with his vision of political freedom and the advocacy of Christianity. This proved to be a magnet of controversy as the station was opened to uncensored live commentary from viewers and launched the nation’s first live international news coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Charisma Magazine, "[Financial Dispute Forces Mongolian Christian TV Station to Shut Down]http://www.charismamag.com/display.php?id=8086," October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Uncensored public commentary was a radical change in Mongolia’s media and political landscape. Newspaper articles and criticism from public officials on Mongolia’s State run television were countered by Eagle TV openly advocating increased freedom of speech and press through television, and it launched a strategy to increase public input into Eagle TV’s on-air operations.

In the early years, notable programming that aired on the channel included NBA playoffs with Mongolian commentary, The Flintstones (dubbed and renamed as ''The Flintstone People'') and CNN relays. This was attached to religious programming, both local and American. In 1997, it was expected that the Christian programming would be dropped by 2000.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, [Go Shout It From the Tent Tops!]https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/26/magazine/go-shout-it-from-the-tent-tops.html, June 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, unbeknown to Eagle TV’s viewers, the shareholders were embroiled in long-standing and severe disagreements over issues of contribution and control of the newly dynamic TV station.&lt;ref&gt;''Mongol News,'' "Eagle Shuts Down," April 22, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; One month after achieving its highest-ever ratings, the shareholders abruptly closed the station as a result of legal threats and corporate infighting.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, [Mongolian Christian TV Station Shuts Down]http://www.asuult.net/nemesis/mongolian_judiciary/newseagle.htm, June 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Mongolia, controlled by the former [[communist]] party, reacted by revoking MBC’s broadcast license, preventing the station from re-launching its operations.

After the station's closure, AMONG Foundation formed Eagle Broadcasting Company,&lt;ref&gt;Mongol News, "Eagle's Staff Got Paid," May 2, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; appointing Tom Terry as Managing Director, and charging him with re-launching Eagle TV as a cable TV channel. About half a year later the new Eagle TV began broadcasting on SANSAR Cable as Mongolia’s first all-news cable channel.

Eagle TV launched a 24/7 news format with uncensored public commentary during live newscasts as a cornerstone of the station. In addition, it launched the nation’s first live coverage of in-country breaking news including the only all-day live coverage of Mongolia’s 2005 presidential election.

In light of the increasing popularity of Eagle TV’s cable operations, the former business partners AMONG and MMC negotiated their further cooperation over most of 2005. The talks resulted in an agreement in September 2005 for the Mongolian side to acquire the broadcast license for terrestrial Channel 8, and Eagle Broadcasting Company to have exclusive use of the channel for ten years, and exercising exclusive control over all television content during that period. Based upon the agreement the Mongolian government restored the license for Channel 8, paving the way for Eagle TV to return to its former channel.&lt;ref&gt;Across Pacific Magazine, "[Eagle Television Begins Broadcasting on Channel 8]http://across.co.nz/MongoliaChristianTV.html, October 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 2005, Eagle Television launched its Channel 8 broadcasts with live all-day coverage of U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]]’s visit to Mongolia.

On April 1, 2011 Eagle TV was sold to Mongolia Media Corporation, a subsidiary of Bodi International. Terry resigned his position as company president and was appointed as Executive Director of AMONG Mongolia, a television production company in Ulaanbaatar producing Christian television programming airing on Eagle TV.

On February 3rd, 2014 Terry released, "Like An Eagle," a biography of his nine years with Eagle Television. At this point, the station had become a full-on news channel (Eagle News) owned by Mongol Mass Media Group, also becoming a CNN partner. The channel had become entirely secular, having dropped their religious programming from the days as a station owned by the AMONG Foundation. The religious programming moved to sister channel '''Eagle Live''', with AMONG only being involved in program production rather than channel ownership.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15030">[[Image:Cover of the Vocal Score of Sidney Jones' The Geisha.jpg|thumb|''[[The Geisha]]'' was a popular Edwardian musical comedy]]
'''Edwardian musical comedy''' was a form of British [[musical theatre]] that extended beyond the reign of King [[Edward VII]] in both direction, beginning in the early 1890s, when the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas' dominance had ended, until the rise of the American musicals by [[Jerome Kern]], [[Rodgers and Hart]], [[George Gershwin]] and [[Cole Porter]] following the [[World War I|First World War]].

Between ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' in 1892 and ''[[The Maid of the Mountains]]'', premiering in 1917, this new style of musical theatre became dominant on the musical stage in Britain and the rest of the English-speaking world.  The popularity of ''In Town'' and ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' (1893), led to an astonishing number of hits over the next three decades, the most successful of which included ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' (1894), ''[[The Geisha]]'' (1896), ''[[Florodora]]'' (1899), ''[[A Chinese Honeymoon]]'' (1901), ''[[The Earl and the Girl]]'' (1903), ''[[The Arcadians (musical)|The Arcadians]]'' (1909), ''[[Our Miss Gibbs]]'' (1909), ''[[The Quaker Girl]]'' (1910), ''[[Betty (musical)|Betty]]'' (1914), ''[[Chu Chin Chow]]'' (1916) and ''The Maid of the Mountains'' (1917).

==History==
Edwardian musical comedy began in the last decade of the [[Victorian era]] and captured the optimism, energy and good humour of the new century and the [[Edwardian era]], as well as providing comfort during the First World War. The [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]]'s well-loved but racy [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] were coming to the end of their popularity, and so was the run of phenomenally successful family-friendly [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas.  These two genres had dominated the musical stage since the 1870s. A few lighter, more romantic [[comic opera]]s, beginning with ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'' (1886) found success and showed that audiences wanted something lighter than operetta, but more coherent in construction than burlesque, that featured the modern fashions and culture of the day.&lt;ref name=Ganzl56&gt;Ganzl, Kurt, "Musicals", London: Carlton (1995), p. 56 {{ISBN|0-7475-2381-9}}; Hyman, Alan, "The Gaiety Years", London: Cassell (1975), p. 64 {{ISBN|0-304-29372-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===George Edwardes===
The father of the Edwardian musical was [[George Edwardes|George 'The Guv'nor' Edwardes]].  He took over the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in the 1880s and, at first, improved the quality of the old [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] burlesques.  Perceiving that their time had passed, he experimented with a modern-dress, family-friendly musical theatre style, with breezy, popular songs, snappy, romantic banter, and stylish spectacle.  These drew on the traditions of [[Savoy opera]] and also used elements of burlesque and of Americans [[Edward Harrigan|Harrigan and Hart]].  Their plots were simple, and they included elaborate displays of contemporary fashion and settings, and lighthearted parody of modern social convention and topical issues.&lt;ref&gt;Traubner, Richard. [https://books.google.com/books?id=cyC-YCK7FigC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=%22George+Edwardes%22+burlesque+musicals+girl&amp;source=web&amp;ots=MRGZbthdCs&amp;sig=-CbovdOqEfAQyw4Q_JQRb7vaoRA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result ''Operetta: A Theatrical History''], pp. 198–219, Routledge, 2003 {{ISBN|0-415-96641-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He replaced the bawdy women of burlesque with his "respectable" corps of dancing, singing [[Gaiety Girls]] who wore the latest fashions, and also showed off their bodies in chorus lines and bathing attire, as well as singing, to complete the musical and visual fun.  These shows were immediately widely copied at other London theatres and then in America.&lt;ref name=Ganzl56/&gt;

[[Image:GeorgeEdwardes.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Edwardes]]]]
The first Edwardian musical comedy was ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' in 1892.  Its success, together with the even greater sensation of ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' in 1893, confirmed Edwardes on the path he was taking.&lt;ref name=AL1&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm "Gaiety Theatre"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104132022/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm |date=January 4, 2008 }}, ArthurLloyd theatre site&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PlayInvent&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/musicals_tour/first_musicals/musical_comedy.php "Musical Comedy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517163242/http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/musicals_tour/first_musicals/musical_comedy.php |date=2007-05-17 }}, Musicals Tour at PeoplePlayUK theatre site&lt;/ref&gt;  These "musical comedies", as he called them, revolutionized the London stage and set the tone for the next three decades.&lt;ref name=Ganzl56/&gt; According to musical theatre writer [[Andrew Lamb (writer)|Andrew Lamb]], "The British Empire and America began to fall for the appeal of the [Edwardian] musical comedy from the time when ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' was taken on a world tour in 1894."&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3052183 "From Pinafore to Porter: United States-United Kingdom Interactions in Musical Theater, 1879–1929",] ''American Music, Vol. 4, No. 1'', British-American Musical Interactions (Spring, 1986), pp. 34-49, University of Illinois Press, retrieved September 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwardes' early Gaiety hits included a series of light, romantic "poor maiden loves aristocrat and wins him against all odds" shows, usually with the word "Girl" in the title.  After ''A Gaiety Girl'' came ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' (1894), ''[[The Circus Girl]]'' (1896) and ''[[A Runaway Girl]]'' (1898).  The heroines were independent young women who often earned their own livings. The stories followed a familiar plot line &amp;ndash; a chorus girl breaks into high society, a shop girl makes a good marriage. There was always a misunderstanding during act one and an engagement at the end.&lt;ref&gt;Coward, Noel. Foreword to ''Musical Comedy'' by Raymond Mander and Joe Mitchenson (New York: Taplinger Publishing, 1969), pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of a contemporary review, Edwardes’ musicals were "Light, bright and enjoyable."  Later Gaiety Theatre "girl" musicals included ''[[The Orchid]]'' (1903), ''[[The Spring Chicken]]'' (1905), ''[[The Girls of Gottenberg]]'' (1907), ''[[Our Miss Gibbs]]'' (1909), ''[[The Sunshine Girl]]'' (1912) and ''[[The Girl on the Film]]'' (1913).&lt;ref name=PlayInvent/&gt;  Perhaps to balance the "girl" musicals, the Gaiety also presented a series of what could be described as "boy" musicals, such as ''[[The Messenger Boy]]'' (1900), ''[[The Toreador]]'' (1901), ''[[The New Aladdin]]'' (1906) and ''[[Theodore and Co.]] (1916)''.  Edwardes expanded his empire to other theatres and presented slightly more complex comedy hits beginning with ''[[An Artist's Model]]'' (1895).  ''[[The Geisha]]'' (1896) and ''[[San Toy]]'' (1899) each ran for more than two years and found great international success, capitalizing on the British craze for all things oriental.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Jeffrey. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-YJUbPSBT94C&amp;pg=PA266&amp;lpg=PA266&amp;dq=%22Short,+sharp+shock%22+phrase+Mikado+Gilbert&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KXOsFxl4NL&amp;sig=9mIn3FrBlCgh-DbvR6-gTugZ6pk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fe8mStP4O6CJtgfk4IDrBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6 ''Imperialism and Music: Britain, 1876-1953''], pp. 262–66, Manchester University Press (2001) {{ISBN|0-7190-6143-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Edwardes hits included ''[[The Girl from Kays]]'' (1902), ''[[The Earl and the Girl]]'' (1903) and ''[[The Quaker Girl]]'' (1910).

===Composers, writers, producers and stars===
The chief glories of Edwardian musical comedies lie in their musical scores.  At their best, these combined the delicacy and sophistication of operetta with the robust tunefulness of the [[music hall]].  The major composers of the genre were [[Sidney Jones (composer)|Sidney Jones]] (''[[The Geisha]]''), [[Ivan Caryll]] (''[[Our Miss Gibbs]]''), [[Lionel Monckton]] (''[[The Quaker Girl]]''), [[Howard Talbot]] (''[[A Chinese Honeymoon]]''), [[Leslie Stuart]] (''[[Florodora]]'') and [[Paul Rubens (composer)|Paul Rubens]] (''[[Miss Hook of Holland]]'').  Scores were constantly refreshed with "additional" or "specialty" numbers and re-arranged, often by several different composers and lyricists, to keep audiences coming back. Important writers included [[Adrian Ross]], [[Harry Greenbank]], [[Percy Greenbank]], [[Owen Hall]], [[Charles H. Taylor (lyricist)|Charles H. Taylor]] and [[Oscar Asche]].  Generally, the book, lyrics and music were each written by different people, which was a first for the musical stage, although now this is the usual way of doing things.  Adrian Ross wrote the lyrics for well over 50 Edwardian musicals.

[[Image:Phyllis dare The Arcadians.jpg|right|thumb|[[Phyllis Dare]] in ''[[The Arcadians (musical)|The Arcadians]]'']]
Besides Edwardes, American producer [[Charles Frohman]] and actor-managers like [[Seymour Hicks]], [[Robert Evett]] and [[George Grossmith, Jr.]] were responsible for many of these shows.  The musicals were frequently built around a resident company of artists, and the greatest stars of the era included actresses [[Marie Tempest]], [[Gertie Millar]], [[Lily Elsie]], [[Ellaline Terriss]] and [[Phyllis Dare]], leading men such as [[Hayden Coffin]] and [[Harry Grattan]], and comics such as [[Rutland Barrington]], George Grossmith, Jr., [[Huntley Wright]] and [[Edmund Payne]].  One critic wrote of [[Joseph Coyne]] that, like other stars of musical comedy, "It is no good their pretending to be any one else.  We go to see themselves, and all we ask is that the authors and others shall give them every chance of being themselves in the most pronounced and personal fashion".&lt;ref&gt;"Royal Adelphi Theatre", ''The Times'', 7 November 1910, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
''[[The Arcadians (musical)|The Arcadians]]'' is generally regarded as the masterpiece of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Ganzl, Kurt (1995), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  The composers were Monckton and Talbot, both at the height of their powers.  The story, about the havoc wreaked when truth-telling Arcadians arrive in corrupt London, neatly parallels the position of Edwardian musical comedies in theatrical history, with [[operetta]]-singing Arcadians, representing the past, meeting with [[music hall]]-singing Londoners, representing the future. This is an example of a common feature of shows of this period: sophistication with a common touch.

''[[Florodora]]'' (1899) by [[Leslie Stuart]] and [[Paul Rubens (composer)|Paul Rubens]] made a splash on both sides of the Atlantic, as did ''[[A Chinese Honeymoon]]'' (1901), by British lyricist [[George Dance (dramatist)|George Dance]] and American-born composer [[Howard Talbot]], which ran for a record setting 1,074 performances in London and 376 in New York.  The story concerns couples who honeymoon in China and inadvertently break the kissing laws (shades of ''[[The Mikado]]'').  Later enormously popular hits included ''[[Chu Chin Chow]]'' (1916), which ran for 2,238 performances (more than twice as many as any previous musical),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-theatres.com/longruns.html#longruns.london.html Compilation of longest-running plays in history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402061014/http://world-theatres.com/longruns.html |date=2010-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/th-longr.html List of longest-running plays in London and New York] from 1875 to 1920&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Theodore &amp; Co]]'' (1916), ''[[The Boy (musical)|The Boy]]'' (1917), ''[[Yes, Uncle!]] (1917)'' and ''[[The Maid of the Mountains]]'' (1917, the second longest-running Edwardian musical, with 1,352 performances).

When the couple decided to try for a third round of IVF, her doctor recommended a [[mammogram]], which is how she found out she had breast cancer. Despite her condition, the couple were still motivated to have a baby, so they continued with the egg retrieval and found a surrogate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Last Chance|series=Giuliana &amp; Bill|network=E!

'''Highbury Theatre''' is a [[amateur theatre|non-professional theatre]] situated in the Royal Town of [[Sutton Coldfield]], [[Birmingham]], [[England]]. It is one of the oldest, established amateur theatres in the city and a founding member of the [[Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain]].

== Origins ==
[[File:Highbury Theatre, Boldmere - geograph.org.uk - 1599272.jpg|thumb|left|Highbury Theatre]]
Conceived in 1924 by Bertie English, the theatre originally started life as a simple play reading group, under the name, The Erdington ILP Play-reading Circle. As the members passion developed from just reading plays together, they began to start producing and acting in various productions. On 5 March 1925, they performed their first stage production of ''Little Sins and Pretty Sinners'' at the Folkhouse, [[Erdington]]. In 1928, a 17-year-old [[John English (theatre director)|John English]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Midland+Arts+Centre+and+Highbury+Theatre+founder%3B+OBITUARY.-a060547538 |title=Midland Arts Centre and Highbury Theatre founder; OBITUARY. - Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date=1999-01-01 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; took over from his father as the Director of the company. Rehearsals would often be held at his home which was named, ''Highbury''. Subsequently, in that same year, the group chose to rename themselves after their rehearsal space and became; The Highbury Players. Due to no theatre of their own, the company were still having to produce plays in local church halls until 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/stage/venues/g_m/highbury.shtml |title=Birmingham Stage - The Highbury Little Theatre |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mollie Randle &amp; Noel Sherwood|title=Highbury Theatre Centre: Sixteen Years After|year=1963|publisher=Highbury Theatre Centre.|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hope more than expectation they set up a building fund and began to search for premises.

[[File:The_original_Highbury_Theatre.jpg|thumb|right|The original theatre (right) and building next door later purchased]] But it was in 1937, that they purchased the freehold site on Sheffield Road from Rhonda Anstey (of [[Anstey College of Physical Education]]), using an existing World War I mission chapel (once used as a hospital for World War I veterans) as the basis for their new theatre, at a cost of just over £200.&lt;ref&gt;http://highburytheatre.co.uk/ahlt/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; Using this basic structure they built, almost entirely on their own, their own theatre. Members learnt new skills on site first hand, to build brick walls, plastering, joinery, electrics, metalwork and much more, pulling together to create a theatre of their own. They worked both night and day during the early years of the Second World War to complete it. When the war broke out in 1939 most of the work was undertaken by the female members. It was through dedication and without financial aid or patronage; that the theatre was constructed, along with its traditions which helped to lay the foundations of what it eventually became. The original theatre seats were donated to the theatre when the then newly refurbished Prince of Wales theatre in the City Centre was bombed during an air raid, some of the seats still proudly bore the bomb splinters. When building work was completed, the new building was christened; Highbury Little Theatre.

Highbury Little Theatre officially opened on 22 May 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/627-highbury-little-theatre |title=Highbury Little Theatre |publisher=The Theatres Trust |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Arms and the Man]]'' and has since then continually produced a season of plays for the last 7 decades. The theatre and its programme are constantly being revised and  adjusted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.openlylocal.com/planning_applications/1940147-Planning-Application-2012-04495-PA-Highbury-Theatre-Centre-Sheffie- |title=Planning Application 2012/04495/PA, Highbury Theatre Centre Sheffie... :: Birmingham City Council :: Openly Local |publisher=Assets.openlylocal.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521065909/http://assets.openlylocal.com/planning_applications/1940147-Planning-Application-2012-04495-PA-Highbury-Theatre-Centre-Sheffie- |archivedate=2014-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for a 21st Century theatregoing audience.

It was in 1946 that John English who, along with other theatre directors around the country, had the vision to form the [[Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain]] of which Highbury was a founder member, alongside The [[Crescent Theatre]] and [[The Questors Theatre]] with 6 other theatre companies. The early years of the twentieth century saw the beginning of the "little theatre" movement, whereby small, independent  theatres ran on an unpaid basis providing theatre to their local areas. In January 1949, Highbury hosted its first Guild National Conference with an increased number of 14 member theatres. From the 9 original members, the LTG now have over 100 member theatres. English consequently went on to co-found The [[Midlands Arts Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macbirmingham.co.uk/about/history/ |title=History |publisher=mac birmingham |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.thebiggive.org.uk/charity/view/4095/mac-birmingham |title=mac birmingham &amp;#124; The Big Give |publisher=Secure.thebiggive.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Arena Theatre Company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.search.connectinghistories.org.uk/engine/resource/default.asp?theme=49&amp;originator=%2Fengine%2Ftheme%2Fdefault.asp&amp;page=&amp;records=&amp;direction=&amp;pointer=61&amp;text=1&amp;resource=1726 |title=Proposal for a Midlands Arts Centre for Young People |publisher=Search.connectinghistories.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with his wife Mollie Randle.

The Theatre was fortunate enough to have amongst its Patrons the founder of [[The Birmingham Rep]]; [[Barry Jackson (director)|Sir Barry Jackson]], the actor [[Sir Cedric Hardwicke]] and MP [[Sir John Mellor, 2nd Baronet]] alongside fifteen other influential people in both the local and theatrical communities.

During the 1980s major alterations and extensions took place. This was possible due to the acquisition of an old shop next door, which was incorporated into the theatre allowing the theatre to expand and add more facilities to a much better equipped theatre. During this period, the theatre's executive body also purchased land and houses that surrounded the theatre, as a result they could, and still remain able to, rent out the houses/apartments with the funds being used to support the theatre and allowing it to produce more challenging plays without the fear of making losses.

In 2008, the decision was made that the theatre change its name for the second time in its history, this time changing it to; Highbury Theatre Centre. This was primarily due to the fact that the theatre had been expanding over the years offering more than just theatre and offering more facilities to the community, essentially making it a [[community theatre]]. In 2018 as part of a marketing revamp, the theatre slightly edited its name once more, to the more to the point, Highbury Theatre.

== Plays ==

The theatre's resident company remains, The Highbury Players who during the course of a 10-month season; put on 7 Main Stage productions and 3 Studio plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdtg.magix.net/index_htm_files/Highbury.pdf |title=Birmingham and district theatre guild: group members' profile |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plays are chosen by an elected Arts Committee led by the Arts Director and aim to continue the Highbury tradition of having within every season; an English Classic, an International Classic and a play connecting the theatre with our own times, amongst both classic and contemporary plays. The theatre is one of two major [[amateur]] companies that operate in the Sutton Coldfield area, the other being Sutton Arts Theatre who have close ties with Highbury both historically and personally.

All plays staged at the theatre are reviewed by the online reviewers ''Behind the Arras''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthearras.com/reviewsam/reviews_by_affiliates.html#HIGHBURY |title=Reviews By Affiliates |publisher=Behindthearras.com |date=1916-07-17 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; who employ retired, professional theatre journalists to critique each production. Each year, plays and performances are nominated for the BFAME Awards. This is a ceremony held with all the nominated amateur theatres in the city and in which Highbury has either received a nomination in a certain category or won every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mail |first=Birmingham |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/your-communities-theatre-gongs-sutton-6766029|title=Your Communities: Theatre Gongs |publisher=Birmingham Mail | date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014 it was announced that Highbury would be working in partnership with [[Birmingham Town Hall]] and [[Symphony Hall, Birmingham|Symphony Hall]] (THSH) to support community arts as Birmingham City Council Arts Champions for the Sutton Coldfield District.&lt;ref&gt;http://suttoncoldfieldlocal.co.uk/thsh-arts-champions-1221446/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opportunities ==

The theatre is a registered charity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opencharities.org/charities/223923 |title=Highbury Theatre Centre Limited |publisher=OpenCharities |date=2013-11-10 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and is run entirely by a 160+ team of dedicated volunteers who are involved in many aspects from [[acting]], [[Theatre director|directing]], [[set design]], [[costume]], [[front of house]] amongst numerous other opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avenueq.org/the-venue.aspx |title=The Venue - Avenue Q at The Highbury Theatre Centre |publisher=Avenueq.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809100607/http://avenueq.org/the-venue.aspx |archivedate=2014-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre welcomes newcomers allowing them to get involved in all areas, such as helping out as a costumer in their extensive wardrobe departments or by helping construct some of their award-winning sets.

The theatre is a valuable asset to the local and wider community; with various events and art exhibitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mail |first=Birmingham |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/artist-to-exhibit-work-at-highbury-theatre-60239 |title=Artist to exhibit work at Highbury Theatre Centre |publisher=Birmingham Mail |date=2008-03-18 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking place there throughout the year. In late 2013, the theatre decided to resurrect one of the original theatre's features from 1943 to 1956, the Highbury Film Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highburytheatre.co.uk/ahlt/0htc/filmclub.html |title=Highbury Little Theatre - Sutton Coldfield. Youth Theatre |publisher=Highburytheatre.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working alongside the [[British Film Institute]] and the [[British Federation of Film Societies]]. The original club was known for showing [[Experimental film]]s and [[Art film|arthouse]] films from around the world, which they have now reintroduced alongside classic films. The new, reinstated film club became a permanent fixture in 2014, now being included in all the theatre's future seasons.

== Other facilities ==

The theatre is also home to Highbury Youth Theatre, which gives local children the chance to experience performing on stage, in front of a live audience, as well as developing their skills and confidence. Members are given the opportunity to work towards [[LAMDA]] examinations should they wish and have access to the National Association of Youth Theatres' workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MDK Web &amp; Media Ltd. |url=http://www.nayt.org.uk/youth_theatres/highbury_youth_theatre |title=Youth Theatre: Youth Theatre: Highbury Youth Theatre - Highbury Youth Theatre - National Association of Youth Theatres |publisher=Nayt.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre is one of very few amateur societies that has its own premises, doing so enables the theatre to be able to provide more amenities to both members and audiences. It has its own bar, coffee lounge, 3 large dressing rooms, communal [[green room]], vast wardrobe departments, in house set building workshops, rehearsal rooms, props department, furniture store and much more. It is by having such facilities that the theatre and its equipment is available for hire by external companies who are without places to rehearse and stage their own productions.

== Milestones ==

On 29 April 2014, the theatre commemorated the 90th anniversary of the formation of The ILP Play reading circle, by having a special reading of two of the first plays ever performed by them back in 1924 when the company simply read the plays. The plays, by [[John Drinkwater (playwright)|John Drinkwater]], included; ''The Storm'' and ''X=0''. On 5 March 2015, the theatre celebrated the 90th anniversary of The Highbury Players first ever stage production. At the event, rare unseen film footage was shown of the original members building the first theatre.

==Notable members==

The following people were Highbury Players and/or members;

* [[John English (theatre director)|John English]] - [[Midlands Arts Centre|MAC]] Founder
* [[Tony Garnett]] - Film &amp; Television Producer

'''Identification''' is a key term for the discussion of [[rhetoric]] in [[Kenneth Burke]]′s ''[[A Rhetoric of Motives]]''. He uses it to evaluate the traditional perception of [[rhetoric]] as persuasion.  Burke suggests that whenever someone attempts to persuade someone else, [[Identification (psychology)|identification]] occurs, because for persuasion to occur, one party must "identify" with another. That is, the one who becomes persuaded sees that one party is like another in some way. Burke's definition of identification works not only in relation to the self (e.g. that tree has arms and is like me, thus I identify with that tree) it also refers to exterior identification (e.g. that man eats beef patties like that group, thus he is identified with that beef-patty-eating group). One can perceive identification between objects that are not the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Rhetoric of Motives|last=Burke|first=Kenneth|publisher=University of California Press|year=1969|isbn=0-520-01546-0|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Rhetoric of Motives'' opens with an analysis of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'' and [[Matthew Arnold]]'s ''[[Empedocles on Etna]]''; from his analysis, Burke eventually extricates the term “identification.”  From there, Burke uses the term to reclaim certain elements of rhetoric that have fallen away, while simultaneously expanding it to show how “identification” supplements traditional emphases on persuasion as central. The concept of identification, argues Burke, gives us an additional way of looking at rhetoric's role in [[human relations]], specifically ways in which people enact [[social cohesion]].

==Identification and the Realm of Rhetoric==

In particular, the concept of identification can expand our vision of the realm of rhetoric as more than solely agonistic. To be sure, that is the way we have traditionally situated it: “Rhetoric,” writes Burke, “is ''par excellence'' the region of the Scramble, of insult and injury, bickering, squabbling, malice and the lie, cloaked malice and the subsidized lie. . . . We begin with an anecdote of killing (in ''Samson Agonistes'' and “Empedocles on Etna”), because [[invective]], [[eristic]], [[polemic]], and [[logomachy]] are so pronounced an aspect of rhetoric” (19-20). But while impelled to acknowledge this nature, we can look for more from rhetoric, he argues:
: “We need never deny the presence of strife, enmity, factions, as a characteristic motive of rhetorical expression. We need not close our eyes to their almost tyranneous ubiquity in human relations; we can be on the alert always to see how such temptations to strife are implicit in the institutions that condition human relationships; yet we can at the same time always look beyond this order, to the principle of identification in general, a [[terministic]] choice justified by the facts that the identifications in the order of love are also characteristic of rhetorical expression.” (20)

==Facets of Identification==

What is identification? Burke spends most of the rest of Section I of ''A Rhetoric of Motives'' exploring the concept, at the same time hammering out the realm of rhetoric.

===Identification and Consubstantiality===

In identifying with the interests of another (or being persuaded that shared interests exist, even if they do not), one is “substantially one” with that other, or ''[[consubstantial.]]'' At the same time, each individual can retain unique substance. ''Substance,'' a recurring Burkean theme, was examined in terms of its “universal paradoxes” in ''[[Grammar of Motives]]'' and in its manifestations as unique constructed acts in ''[[Symbolic of Motives]];'' here, in the ''Rhetoric,'' substance is examined in its implications of division. To “identify with” is to become consubstantial, but, at the same time, as the ''Rhetoric'' shows us, “to begin with ‘identification’ is, by the same token, though roundabout, to confront the implications of division” (22).

It is in this key discussion of identification, [[consubstantiality]], and division that Burke lays out his crucial definition of the realm of rhetoric:
: “Insofar as the individual is involved in conflict with other individuals or groups, the study of this same individual would fall under the head of ''Rhetoric''. . . . The ''Rhetoric'' must lead us through the Scramble, the Wrangle of the Market Place, the flurries and flare-ups of the Human Barnyard, the Give and Take, the wavering line of pressure and counterpressure, the Logomachy, the onus of ownership, the War of Nerves, the War.” (23)

===Identification and Property===

In metaphysics, “a thing is identified by its ''properties”'' (23), but a rhetorical identification by property refers to material, economic property. Identification by material property is ethical, Burke states, but it is also the source of turmoil and discord when identifications establishing themselves through property come into relation with one another. The importance of property and the simultaneous, overlapping cooperation and conflict it entails make property and identification a key rhetorical topic, Burke says: “Put identification and division ambiguously together, so that you cannot know for certain just where one ends and the other begins, and you have the characteristic invitation to rhetoric. . . . The wavering line between the two cannot be ‘scientifically’ identified; rival rhetoricians can draw it at different places, and their persuasiveness varies with the resources each has at hand” (25).

In this section, Burke also notes the way identification functions as a screen, placing the term again firmly within the realm of rhetoric. Using science as an example, Burke explains that “however ‘pure’ one’s motives may be actually, the impurities of identification lurking about the edges of such situations introduce a typical Rhetorical wrangle of the sort that can never be settled once and for all, but belongs in the field of moral controversy where men properly seek to ‘prove opposites’” (26).

===Identification and Autonomy===

Identification can also be seen as the way in which specialized activities occupy, rather than transcend or escape, larger contexts: “The fact that an activity is capable of reduction to intrinsic, autonomous principles does not argue that it is free from identification with other orders of motivation extrinsic to it. Such other orders are extrinsic to it, as considered from the standpoint of the specialized activity alone. However, they are not extrinsic to the field of moral action as such, considered from the standpoint of human activity in general. . . . ‘Identification is a word for the autonomous activity’s place in this wider context.” (27)

Identification in this particular aspect is thus yet another major path into, or topic of, rhetoric; for example, “we are clearly in the region of rhetoric when considering the identifications whereby a specialized activity makes one a participant in some social or economic class. ‘Belonging’ in this sense is rhetorical.” (28) Such identification can become sinister when unacknowledged or hidden. Moreover, consubstantiality implies that sinister morality can spread through both substances, as when the morality associated with a so-called autonomous activity serves as the morality for the larger context with which it is identified: “One’s morality as a specialist cannot be allowed to do duty for one’s morality as a citizen. Insofar as the two roles are at odds, a specialty at the service of sinister interests will itself become sinister.” (31)

===Identification and Cunning===

Here Burke suggests expanding the realm of rhetoric to include the ways in which we operate rhetorically upon ourselves, forging identifications through unexamined or nonconscious motives, self-protective or suicidal. “If a social or occupational class is not too exacting in the scrutiny of identifications that flatter its interests, its very life is a profitable malingering (profitable at least until its inaccuracies catch up with it) — and as such, it is open to attack or analysis, Rhetoric comprising both the ''use'' of persuasive resources ''(rhetorica utens,'' as with the philippics of Demosthenes) and the study of them ''(rhetorica docens,'' as with Aristotle’s treatise on the ‘art’ of Rhetoric)” (36). The key element here that brings in cunning is consciousness, or perhaps more to the point, purposeful unconsciousness, or hypocrisy: “This aspect of identification, whereby one can protect an interest merely by not using terms incisive enough to criticize it properly, often brings rhetoric to the edge of cunning” (36).

'''''Knights and Warriors''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[game show|competition]] [[television program]] created in 1992 by its executive producer, [[Jerry Gilden]], and produced by what at the time was known as the Welk Entertainment Group. Originating at [[CBS]]/MTM Studio Center in [[Studio City, California]], the series was similar to ''[[American Gladiators]]'' but with a [[medieval]] theme. The series matched a cast of amateur [[athlete]]s against each other, as well as against the group of "Warriors". The show was hosted by Joe Fowler and [[Lisa Canning]].

==The Setting==
[[Bernard Erhard]] portrayed the Lord of Rules and Discipline (L.O.R.D.) who also acted as the show's resident referee. In the first season's original opening scene, he narrates the story as follows:

''It is written in the Book of Good and Evil that in a time long ago, all was peace and harmony, Paradise on Earth. Then one fateful day, the universe shifted, all was dark, and for those born on that day, their evil destiny was sealed! Now, they have united to wreak havoc on an unsuspecting world --- and forevermore will be known as WARRIORS!''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRtv99NwuYA&lt;/ref&gt;

This opening title sequence loosely resembles the legend of King Arthur and recalls how the world was a utopia until the day a dark force disrupted the balance that separated good from evil; and how, with that dark force, a barbarian horde known as the Warriors began to storm through the kingdoms. The L.O.R.D. has accordingly called for "modern-day knights" to battle the Warriors and restore honor.

The "knights" are two teams of one man and one woman. The teams are colored purple and gold. The knights must go through eight challenges set forth by the Warriors to win the game. The L.O.R.D. hands out punishment to the Warriors for any cheating, but he can also punish the knights if they cheat during competition, which was very rare in this show's all-too-short history.

The audience all wave and purple and gold triangular flags while cheering on the knights.

==The Warriors==
The Warriors are the show's [[antagonist]]s. In reality, they're hired actors almost similar to the Gladiators.

*PLAGUE: The leader of the Warriors and considerably the strongest. Portrayed by [[Jim Maniaci]].
*STEEL MAIDEN: A female Warrior, beautiful and powerful. Portrayed by [[Nancy Georges]].
*PYRO: The Warriors' hotheaded firestarter, some say the most popular of the Warriors. Portrayed by [[Douglas Rogel]].
*LADY BATTLEAXE: A large female Warrior with unparalleled strength. Portrayed by real-life armwrestling champion [[Dot Jones]].
*KNIGHTMARE: A tough Warrior known as the Duke of Doom. Portrayed by [[Benny Graham (actor)|Rodney Mitchell]].
*PRINCESS MALICE: A so-called princess who turned to the dark side. Portrayed by fitness model and [[Cory Everson]]'s sister [[Cameo Kneuer]].
*CHAOS: The most unstable and unpredictable of the Warriors, hence his name. Portrayed by [[Benny Graham (actor)|Benny Graham]].
*VENOM: A devious, dangerous female Warrior. Portrayed by Jessica Long.
*RAVEN: Replaced Steel Maiden in Season 2. Unknown performer.
*SLASH: A male "alternate" Warrior. Unknown performer.
*VANDAL: Another male "alternate" Warrior. Unknown performer.
*EMPRESS VIXXEN: A female "alternate" Warrior. Unknown performer.

==The Challenges==
The start and end of each event are marked by the sound of a [[gong]] and [[trumpet]] [[fanfare]] to begin the event, and only a gong sound to end the event.

===Catapult===
The knights must catch red dodgeballs being launched by a catapult while trying to evade yellow dodgeballs being fired by the Warriors using giant slingshots. Once the red balls are caught, the knights must throw them into the ring of fire to score. Points are scored based on which section of the playing mat the knight threw the red ball from. In Season 1, the mat was divided into three sections worth 5, 10 and 15 points, with 15 being the furthest away. In Season 2, only the front two sections of the mat were used, with the middle section scoring 25 points, and the front section scoring 50 (as the knight would have to brave harder hits from the dodgeballs). After 60 seconds, the challenge is over. Both the male and female knights took a turn competing in this event.

Pyro was always the Warrior whose tricks would ignite the ring of fire to start the match.

===Battle Swords===
The knight and Warrior run across treadmills on an elevated platform trying to knock each other down with foam bats. The challenge is 30 seconds. A win or a Warrior disqualification earns the knight 50 points while a draw is worth 25 points. Grabbing an opponent's weapon or crossing over the small barrier between the treadmills automatically disqualifies the offender. Only one gender competes in this event.

===Sorcerer's Wheel===
The knight has 45 seconds to run across a spinning track with two hurdles. Every completed lap on the wheel is worth 10 points each. However, a lap doesn't count if both of the knight's feet touch the inside of the wheel. The Warriors stand on the outside of the wheel swinging a 75-pound spiked ball on a chain to knock the knight off the wheel and out of the game. Whichever gender did not participate in Battle Swords competes in this event.

===Volcano===
Two knights have 45 seconds (60 for the women) to climb up a giant 30-foot volcano-shaped net. Inside the net are 4 Warriors. One Warrior is strapped to a harness while the other three Warriors control the height and angle. The harnessed Warrior has pads to knock the knight down trying to prevent them from scoring. Scoring ranges from 3 sections of the net, each separated by a metal ring connected to the net. The bottom of the net is worth 25 points while the next section is worth 50 points and the top section is 75 points. If the knight manages to climb to the top of the Volcano and grab their team flag, he(she) will earn 100 points. Both genders compete in this event.

===Roller Joust===
Each knight have 45 seconds to skate around the jousting arena trying to dodge two Warriors trying to bring the knight down. The knight carries a foam lance which is used to capture rings on poles scattered around the arena. Red rings are worth 10 points while the gold rings are worth 25 points. For the first 15 seconds, the knight can take one of the paths forming an X inside the arena to escape the Warriors. Once inside the X area, the Warriors cannot enter or interfere. After 15 seconds, the Warrior-Free Zone is lifted and play resumes as normal. One gender competed in this event in Season 1, and both genders each took a turn in Season 2.

===Tug O' Warriors===
The knight and the Warrior are each standing on rotating platforms while each of them pulls on a rope. The knight has 30 seconds to pull the Warrior of their platform. If the knight wins, he or she earns 100 points. If 30 seconds expires or both go over, 50 points are awarded for a draw. Only one gender competes in this event. (In Season 1, the gender that did not participate in Roller Joust competed.)

===The Pit===
In this challenge, the knights are pitted against each other inside a bowl-like arena. The Warriors outside the bowl rock it back and forth with the knights inside it. The object in this game is for one knight to pin the other using a pad. Depending on where the pin was, the bowl has 4 scoring sections: two 25 points, one 50 point and one 75 point section. After 45 seconds, the total number of points are added up. Pins without using the pads won't count. Both genders took a turn competing in this event.

A notable moment in the show's early round one episodes occurred when Knight Robert Pavell of the purple suffered a head injury while inside the Pit; he and his opponent, Michael West of the gold team, scored no points in the Pit.  He was replaced by Jeff Joccum, who later went on to score in the finale and ensure a win of the purple team.

===Target Onslaught===
Similar to the ''[[American Gladiators]]'' final event, the Eliminator, Target Onslaught is the show's final event. Target Onslaught is a two-part challenge.

One knight becomes the shooter, aiming a crossbow-like cannon and firing foam arrows at six targets from afar as the other knight loads the crossbow. The targets include a dragon, spinning flags, the Sun, the Moon, and two shields. The first knight has 30 seconds to shoot the targets. The first knight cannot move to the next target until the last one is shot down. Instead of points, the knight earns 5 additional seconds for his/her partner for every successful hit.

After 30 seconds expires, the second half of Target Onslaught begins. The second knight now becomes the shooter and the first knight loads the crossbow as they attempt to shoot the Warriors which travel back and forth across the top of the arena on three rails using handrail slides. The closest rail is 50 points, the next rail is 100 points and the furthest rail is 150 points. After 30–60 seconds, the final scores are totaled.

==The Final Results==
The team with the most points at the end of the show wins and receive medals awarded to them by the L.O.R.D. and the servant girls beside him.  Prizes are also awarded to the knights, indicated by hostess Lisa Canning as the show comes back from various commercial breaks.

In a "Knights and Warriors Tournament", which was ultimately the series finale, the champions of the Tournament are crowned "Sir" and "Madam" by the Lord of Rules and Discipline, and receive gold trophies awarded by the show.

'''Lifting stones''' are heavy natural stones which people are challenged to lift, proving their strength. They are common throughout northern [[Europe]], particularly [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Iceland]] (where they are referred to as ''steintökin''), [[Scandinavia]] and [[North West England]] in the area that was once inhabited by the [[Welsh people|Welsh]], now modern day Cumbria. Some of the stones are so heavy that there has been no authenticated lift in modern times, only [[legend]].

Recently, lifting stones have been incorporated into the [[World's Strongest Man]] competitions, using various cast, found, or established challenge stones such as the [[Husefell Stone]].  They also do a stylized version of an event derived from an ancient contest, in which men would see who could load the heaviest stone onto a stone wall, derived from building such a wall, where they are known as [[Atlas Stones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodyresults.com/s2stone.asp |title=How to make an Atlas Stone |publisher=bodyresults.com |accessdate=2015-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619020329/http://www.bodyresults.com/s2stone.asp |archivedate=2015-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iceland==
[[File:Djupalonsandur stones in Iceland.JPG|thumb|upright|Lifting stones in Djúpalónsandur in Iceland, weighing from top to bottom 25, 54, 104, and 154 kg]]
In Iceland, lifting stones were categorised into the 
*''fullsterkur'' ("full strength") weighing 155&amp;nbsp;kg (341 pounds)
*''hálfsterkur'' ("half strength") at 104&amp;nbsp;kg (228.8 pounds)
*''hálfdrættingur'' ("weakling") at 49&amp;nbsp;kg (107.8 pounds) and
*''amlóði'' ("useless") at 23&amp;nbsp;kg (50.6 pounds)
They were traditionally used to qualify men for work on fishing boats, with the ''hálfsterkur'' being the minimum weight a man would have to lift onto a ledge at hip-height to qualify. One such set of stones can be found on the beach of [[Djúpalónssandur]] at the foot of [[Snæfellsjökull]]. One of the most famous Icelandic stones is the [[Husafell Stone]] which weighs 190&amp;nbsp;kg (418&amp;nbsp;lb).

==Faroe Islands==
Every settlement in the Faroe Islands used to have its local lifting stone, called a ''hav'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visiteysturoy.fo/uk/data/attachments/61561FEE-C20F-4D6A-8EF6-CCD5670AF30F/8F6E45FB-5360-4867-BF2F-BFAAA4F83408.pdf Visit Esturoy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305011023/http://www.visiteysturoy.fo/uk/data/attachments/61561FEE-C20F-4D6A-8EF6-CCD5670AF30F/8F6E45FB-5360-4867-BF2F-BFAAA4F83408.pdf |date=2014-03-05 }}, pages 7 &amp; 12&lt;/ref&gt; 
derived from the verb ''hevja'' which means 'to lift'. Visiting men would be challenged by the locals to show off their strength.

==Scotland==

===Clach cuid fir===
'''Clach cuid fir''', [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] for "manhood stones", originate from [[Scotland]]. Manhood stones were used for centuries as tests of strength in Scotland. Typically, a young man was welcomed into manhood when he was able to lift his clan's testing stone to waist height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.halfsquare.net/shetler_112306.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723142102/http://www.halfsquare.net/shetler_112306.php |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many examples in Scotland including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.halfsquare.net/shetler_112306.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723142102/http://www.halfsquare.net/shetler_112306.php |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the Dinnie Stones (two stones weighing 333&amp;nbsp;kg (734 pounds): 187&amp;nbsp;kg (413 pounds) and 146&amp;nbsp;kg (321 pounds))&lt;ref&gt;http://gordondinnie.com/Lifts.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Menzies Stone (115&amp;nbsp;kg (253.5 pounds))&lt;ref&gt;http://www.menzies.org/newsletters/2/newsletter2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 
Both the McGlashen Stones and the Dinnie Stones have been used in numerous [[Strongman (strength athlete)|Strongman]] competitions since the 1980s including [[World's Strongest Man]] and [[Pure Strength]].

===Clachan-ultaich===
A '''Clach-ultaich''' ({{IPA-gd|kʰl̪ˠaxˈul̪ˠt̪ɪç|pron}}; plural {{lang|gd|clachan-ultaich}}) is another type of lifting stone found in Scotland. Examples are:
* the so-called ''Clach-ultaich Iain Ghairbh MhicGilleChaluim Ratharsair'', "the lifting stone of Iain Garbh MacGilleChaluim of [[Raasay]]", in [[Duntulm]] on the [[Isle of Skye]]. Its weight is said to be a ton.&lt;ref&gt;Dwelly, Edward (1911), Faclair Gàidhlig gu Beurla le Dealbhan/The Illustrated [Scottish] Gaelic-English Dictionary (4th ed.), Glasgow: MacLaren &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Charter or Blue Stones of [[Dailly]] in Ayrshire are a pair of lifting stones located in the cemetery of Old Dailly church.&lt;ref&gt;Love, Dane (2009). ''Legendary Ayrshire. Custom: Folklore: Tradition.'' Auchinleck : Carn Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-9518128-6-0}} pp. 16 - 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* MacLeod's Lift ({{lang-gd|Ultach Fear Hiort}} lit. "St. Kildan's Lift") on [[North Rona|Rona]], names after one John MacLeod who was at one time tacksman and steward of [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]].&lt;ref&gt;Robson, M. ''Rona the Distant Island'' (1991) Acair {{ISBN|0-86152-823-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lifting Stane===
[[File:The Blue Stones of Dailly - geograph.org.uk - 1500376.jpg|thumb|250px|The 'Blue or Charter Stones' of Old Dailly.]]
Near [[Auldgirth]] in [[Dumfries and Galloway]] is a small farm named ''Liftingstane'' where a large stone with a iron handle once stood that was used as a test of strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=R.|year=1901|title=Closeburn (Dumfrieshire). Reminiscent, Historic &amp; Traditional|publisher=Inglis Ker &amp; Co.|isbn=|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Old Dailly]] in [[South Ayrshire]] are the 'Blue or [[Charter Stones]]' that were used for trials of strength to the extent that the local council has bound them with metal bands to prevent their continued use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Love|first=Dane|year=2009|title=Legendary Ayrshire. Custom: Folklore: Tradition.|publisher=Carn Publishing|isbn=978-0-9518128-6-0|pages=16-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Leper's [[Charter Stone]]' at Kingcase in [[Prestwick]], [[South Ayrshire]] was made of black basalt and kidney shaped, used as a lifting stane until it was broken although the parts remain, built into the walls of the old chapel.

==Wales==

According to '''Y pedair Camp ar Hugainyn''' [[Welsh language|Welsh]] for "24 feats of a welshman", stone lifting was a common practice. Usually performed by young boys as a rite of passage into manhood. It is said that once a young boy can lift the stone to his waist he was considered a man. Furthermore, the stone was used to develop a man's strength in preparation for battle.

There was no set size, shape or weight for each stone. Stones varied, depending on what was available within the locality or by what was selected by the king of each region.

The king's ''Teulu'' ("personal army")  were selected from each village or town within his borders, based upon a man's ability to lift stones, run, jump, leap, wrestle, fence, shoot a bow and arrow and throw a spear.

To date, a lifting stone "Y Garreg Orchest" is still in place in the town of [[Criccieth]] in [[Gwynedd]], North Wales. Competitors travel from all across the UK to attempt to lift this mammoth stone.  In 2015 there was one successful lift of the 28 stone Goliath.

==Basque Country==
Stone lifting is also a [[Basque rural sports|traditional Basque Country sport]] involving the lifting of stones, called ''[[Harrijasotzaileak|harri jasotzea]]''. There are several varieties, particularly using round stones and rectangular ones. The goal can be raising and dropping a stone of certain weight as many times as possible or simply raising a heavy stone once in order to beat an existing record.

==Carrying variants==
The "stone carry" or "stone walk" is a traditional Scottish and Icelandic athletic event involving the carrying of large stones down the field of competition. This type of event has become very popular in the sport of Strongman, with many variations being used in numerous competitions all over the world.

The rules are simple: the competitors each pick up a pair of very heavy stones equipped with iron handles, and  carry the paired stones as far down the field as they can. The length of the field varies depending on the site, but a hundred feet is typical. This event is also known as the [[farmer's walk]].

If two or more competitors carry the stones the entire length of the field, heavier stones are then used. At the [[New Hampshire]] [[Highland Games]], the record carry ({{As of|2004|lc=on}}) is a pair of stones weighing 508 [[pound (mass)|pounds]] (230 [[kilogram|kg]]) carried just under 100 feet (30 m).

The game probably originated as an outgrowth of the need to clear stones from agricultural fields to create [[clearance cairn]]s.

A similar Basque sport is the ''[[Basque rural sports#Ontzi eramatea .28churn carrying.29|ontzi eramatea]]'', where the weights were originally milk canisters.

This is a list of home video releases of the 1981 television series ''[[Danger Mouse (1981 TV series)|Danger Mouse]]'' and its [[Danger Mouse (2015 TV series)|2015 revival]].

==United Kingdom==
===1981 series===
[[FremantleMedia]] released six [[DVD region code|Region 0]] DVDs in 2001 through 2003, featuring 6-8 random episodes in each set. In September 2006, Fremantle Media released a further six DVDs, making all episodes available on DVD, and a 25th Anniversary 12-Disc DVD box set. Although the box set received mostly positive reviews, some cited the lack of chronological order of the episodes as a disappointment. A 10-disc "30th Anniversary Edition" box set was released on 26 September 2011, with the episodes in original UK broadcast order.  All UK box sets contain all 161 episodes, but where some stories originally aired in five-minute segments, these have been edited together to make a total of 89 episodes. This means much of David Jason's 'cliffhanger' narration is not present on the UK DVDs.

==United States==
Several volumes of episodes were released on [[VHS]] by [[Thorn EMI]]-[[HBO Video]], in association with Thames Video, during the mid-1980s; these releases included original bumpers which were cut from U.S. airings of the era.

[[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E Home Video]] is licensed by FremantleMedia to release ''Danger Mouse'' to DVD in the United States. They reflect the UK broadcast order and include the original serial format of some stories, retaining David Jason's linking narration. However, the character of Stiletto has his original Italian accent, which was not used in US versions of the series.&lt;ref name=PopmattersStiletto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/danger-mouse-seasons-5-6-dvd/|accessdate=2015-10-27|title=Danger Mouse: The Complete Seasons 5 &amp; 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US version, Stiletto spoke in a [[Cockney accent]].&lt;ref name=PopmattersStiletto /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="65282">This is a list of films based on comics (including [[comic book]]s, [[comic strip]]s, [[manga]]s, and [[graphic novel]]s) that have been or will be rated R by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]]. Many of the following films are also based on [[adult comics]]. Several films on this list were originally released in theaters with NC-17 or X ratings, but were edited down for television or re-released in theaters with an R rating. Others were released to theaters with a gentler rating such as PG-13, but had R-rated versions for home video. Animated and direct-to-dvd comic book movies with a R rating are accepted on this list. R-rated films like ''[[The Toxic Avenger (film)|The Toxic Avenger]]'', ''[[RoboCop]]'', ''[[Darkman]]'', ''[[Defendor]]'', and ''[[Super (2010 American film)|Super]]'' will not be added to this list because they are original ideas and not directly based on any particular comic book.

'''Spider-X''' ('''Brian Kornfield''') is a [[fictional character]] and [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Midnight Sons Unlimited]]'' #3 (October 1993).

As Spider-X was seen by many wearing [[Spider-Man]]'s costume, he is initially believed to be Spider-Man himself, mutated by the [[Darkhold]], until Mrs. Kornfield learned the truth and explained it to them.

Brian Kornfield grew up off [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in [[New York City]], raised by his mother, his father having been killed at an unknown time period. He had a very active [[imagination]] and idolized all [[superhero]]es, even writing letters to as many of them as he could. His mother was brutally assaulted and mugged on the streets of New York. Brian became obsessed with becoming a super-hero, so he could find and take down her muggers.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Brian was met by the Dwarf, an agent of the demon [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]], who offered him the power to be like his idol Spider-Man via a page of the Darkhold. Brian accepted the offer and was transformed into Spider-X. His obsessive desire for vengeance was twisted even further by the black magic of the Darkhold and Brian saw himself as the ultimate arbitrator of justice willing to mete out punishment that no one else would.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Spider-X first brutally slew the mugger who had attacked his mother. He then captured and planned to slay some other criminals, which brought him into conflict with the [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|John Blaze]] when they crashed into a web Spider-X had spun across the entire street. Their conflict ended inconclusively when Spider-X fled from the Ghost Rider's penance stare. His eight eyes may have somehow diluted the stare's force, allowing him to break its hold. Another group of occult investigators/warriors, the [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]], came to New York and investigated a previous letter from Kornfield, which claimed there was an occult basis to the rise in crime in New York City. Spider-X attacked the three when they questioned his mother. His struggles escalated bringing in some of the Darkhold Redeemers summoned by the energy released by the use of a Darkhold page as well as [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]] and even Spider-Man himself.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Still seeking to punish criminals, Spider-X continued to fight off the occult warriors, and traveled to the 14th Street power station where the mutant criminal [[Randall Darby|Paralyzer]] was using the electrical energy to recreate the electrical monster [[Zzzax]]. Spider-X attacked Zzzax and the group of heroes fighting him poured their own powers into the conflict which caused an energy overload, apparently both killing Spider-X and dissipating Zzzax.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

'''Ai Apaec''' is the [[Marvel Comics]] version of the [[ai apaec|chief deity]] of [[Moche culture|Moche culture]], and a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Ai Apaec first appeared in the first issue of the 2011 ''[[Osborn (comic book)|Osborn]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], and was created by [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]] and [[Jamie McKelvie]].

Ai Apaec began appearing as a regular character in the ''[[Dark Avengers]]'' series, beginning with ''Dark Avengers'' #175.

Ai Apaec is a [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeric]] being that has the head, torso, and arms of a human, the lower half being a [[spider]]'s body, [[snake]]s for hair, and long sharp fangs. He was worshipped by the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] people of [[South America]] ([[Peru]]). He was eventually captured by government officials and held in a secret government base somewhere underwater.&lt;ref&gt;''Osborn'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Ai Apaec ends up meeting [[Norman Osborn]] when he ends up transferred to the secret base from the Raft. He joins Osborn, Dr. [[June Covington]], [[Kingmaker (comics)|Kingmaker]] III, and Carny Rives into staging a break-out.&lt;ref&gt;''Osborn'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; The inmates secure an escape pod to get to the surface. Afterwards, Ai Apaec returns to the jungle.&lt;ref&gt;''Osborn'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, [[Shang-Chi]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] discover that Ai Apaec was controlling Bride of Nine Spiders of the [[Immortal Weapons]] to capture the other members.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Island: Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; As Iron Fist fights Ai Apaec, Shang-Chi manages to free the other members where Shang-Chi mutates into a humanoid spider. Upon Iron Fist using his Chi Force to cure Shang-Chi, Iron Fist gets the other Immortal Weapons members to safety while Shang-Chi collapses the hideout on top of Ai Apaec. Afterwards, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] arrested Ai Apaec.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Island: Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

When Norman Osborn reclaimed ownership of [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]], he manages to locate Ai Apaec and recruit him to his latest incarnation of the [[Dark Avengers]] alongside [[Barney Barton]], [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]], June Covington, [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]], and [[Superia]]. To make Ai Apaec his latest [[Spider-Man]], Norman Osborn gives Ai Apaec a genetic-modifying drug that alters his appearance to resemble a six-armed version of the black suit Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #18&lt;/ref&gt; Ai Apaec and the other members of the Dark Avengers are defeated by both Avengers teams when it turns out that his teammate Skaar was the Avengers' double-agent. Ai Apaec's drug wore off and [[Captain America]] knocked him unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #23&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] were missing in time, Ai Apaec was present when the Dark Avengers were recruited by Luke Cage to be a replacement team. Ai Apaec and the other Dark Avengers members were implanted with nanites in order to prevent them from going rogue, and placed under the leadership of Luke Cage.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #175&lt;/ref&gt;

Ai Apaec and the rest of the Dark Avengers team are thrown into an alternate world with [[U.S. Agent (comics)|John Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #184&lt;/ref&gt; Ai Apaec was shown to have been shrunken down when he is a prisoner in Iron Man's lab.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #186&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Hank Pym]] mentions having regrown U.S. Agent's limbs and shrunk Ai Apaec, Iron Man lashes out at him and realizes that Henry Pym's control implant had been reworked. The Dark Avengers make their way through Hell's Kitchen to get to Strangetown. They come across a building covered with webs as Ai Apaec claims that this world's Spider-Man had gone under a profound change to have created a long-lasting web. During the fight between the Dark Avengers and Spider-Man's gang, Ai Apaec tells Barney to load him onto an arrow and fire it at Spider-Man. Spider-Man's Spider-Senses go off and he catches the arrow as Ai Apaec and Spider-Man speak in a different language while the other Dark Avengers have been subdued.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #187&lt;/ref&gt; With help from Ai Apaec, June Covington tells them that they had poisoned Hawkeye on his left side and that the venom must be sucked out. Later on, the Dark Avengers and Spider-Man's gang arrive in Strangetown where they are attacked by the All-Seeing Eye and the Soulsnake. Ai Apaec tells Spider-Man to cast some webbing and give Barney Barton a sword which he uses to destroy the Soulsnake while Spider-Man lands a hard kick to the All-Seeing Eye.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #188&lt;/ref&gt; Ai Apaec is climbing on Doctor Strange's leg, telepathically calling the Dark Avengers to summon an object contained by Spider-Man's webs which would grant him the perfect distraction. Enraged at the death of [[Clea]], Doctor Strange readies an even more powerful spell. Before he can do the spell, Ai Apaec hits him with all the poison he had killing Doctor Strange and ending his slave spell on Moonstone and Skaar.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #189&lt;/ref&gt; Ai Apaec and the Dark Avengers later return to their reality. When Ai Apaec reminds the Dark Avengers that he must be restored to his proper size, June Covington steps on him.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #190&lt;/ref&gt;

Ai Apaec has superhuman strength where it was stated that he was strong enough to rip off a man's head. His long sharp teeth contains a powerful poison and he has enhanced senses. His spider legs can enable him to cling to solid walls and surfaces. Like the [[diving bell spider]], Ai Apaec can wrap himself in a bell-shaped web held by the hair on his legs and abdomen and collect oxygen from the water to exchange the carbon dioxide with the oxygen.

During the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' storyline, the Earth-1771 version of Ai Apaec is attacked by [[Karn (comics)|Karn]]. After a short battle, Karn drains away Apaec's essence reducing him to dust.&lt;ref&gt;''Superior Spider-Man'' #33&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary E. "May" Manning''' (March 12, 1869 - September 17, 1936) was an American sharpshooter &amp; equestrian.

==Biography==
Mary Manning was born on March 12, 1869 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].  Her parents were physician William R. and Mary Manning. May had two sisters, Elmira and Elizabeth Manning and a younger brother,  William B. Manning. May also had three half brothers, Samuel, Edward and Albert Eager.  May met Gordon William Lillie who became famous as [[Pawnee Bill]], while attending Smith College in 1886, they married at her parent's home in Philadelphia later that year.&lt;ref name="Enss"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Enss|first1=Chris|title=Wild Woman Wednesday: May Manning Lillie|url=https://cowgirlmagazine.com/wild-woman-wednesday-may-manning-lillie/|website=Cowgirl Magazine|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon Lillie's wedding gift to his bride was a pony and a Marlin .22 target rifle.  In 1887 May debuted at a sharpshooter for ''Pawnee Bill's Great Wild West Show'' and was billed as 'the greatest Lady Horseback Rifle-shot of the World'.  May traveled the country with her husband's show and was one of the first women to perform as an equestrian and shooter in American Wild West Shows.  May suffered a shooting injury during an act in 1899 that required two of her fingers to be amputated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Browder|Browder (2009)]], p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;  While on tour in 1907, May gave a speech to women in Chicago, she said: "Let any normally healthy woman who is ordinarily strong screw up her courage and tackle a bucking bronco, and she will find the most fascinating pastime in the field of feminine athletic endeavor.  There is nothing to compare, to increase the joy of living, and once accomplished, she’ll have more real fun than any pink tea or theater party or ballroom ever yielded."&lt;ref name="Enss" /&gt;

Eventually May and Gordon settled in [[Pawnee, Oklahoma]] on Blue Hawk Peak.  They built a cabin, established a [[American Bison|buffalo]] herd, and, in 1910, and completed work on their Arts and Crafts style home.  In 1917, May and Gordon adopted a son whom they named Billy.  He died in an accident at the ranch in 1925.  While her husband was on tour, May was the hands-on manager of the Lillie buffalo ranch.  She believed in the buffalo’s importance to the heritage of the American West and to Plains Indian culture.  May was active in the [[Woman's Relief Corps]] and was a member of the [[Order of the Eastern Star|Eastern Star]].  She starred in "May Lillie, Queen of the Buffalo Ranch," a film produced at the ranch.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bricklin|Bricklin (2017)]], p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1936 she and her husband celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary in Taos, New Mexico.  In September of that year they attended a local celebration in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  While driving back to their ranch that night Gordon lost control of their vehicle.  May died on September 17, 1936 as a result of injuries sustained in the accident.&lt;ref name="Enss" /&gt;

In 2011, May Lillie was inducted into the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame for her tireless work during her Wild West Show career as well as her role in the preservation of the American bison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Cowgirl Honoree – Oklahoma|url=http://www.cowgirl.net/portfolios/mary-emma-manning-lillie-may-lillie/|website=National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mind rhyme''' is the suggestion of a [[rhyme]] which is left unsaid and must be inferred by the listener. Mind rhyme may be achieved either by stopping short, or by replacing the expected word with another (which may have the same rhyme or not). '''Teasing rhyme''' is the use of mind rhyme as a form of [[innuendo]], where the unsaid word is [[taboo word|taboo]] or completes a sentence indelicately. 

An example, in the context of [[cheerleading]]:
{{quote|''"Raa Raa REE!  Kick 'em in the knee! / Raa Raa RASS!  Kick 'em in the other knee!"''}}

Mind rhyme is often a form of [[word play]].  The implied rhyme is inferable only from the context. This contrasts with [[rhyming slang]] from which the rhyming portion has been [[Clipping (morphology)|clipped]], which is part of the [[lexicon]]. (An example is ''dogs'', meaning "feet", a clipping of rhyming ''dog's meat''.&lt;ref&gt;Ayto John (2002) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Rhyming Slang'', Oxford, Oxford UP, p. 36. {{ISBN|0-19-280122-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;) 

==Examples==
A traditional example is the song "Sweet Violets" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtnLvrmyh3E&lt;/ref&gt;:

There once was a farmer who took a young miss
In back of the barn where he gave her a lecture
On horses and chickens and eggs
And told her that she had such beautiful
Manners that suited a girl of her charms
A girl that he wanted to take in his
Washing and ironing and then if she did
They could get married and raise lots of
Sweet violets
Sweeter than the roses
Covered all over from head to toe
Covered all over with sweet violets
The girl told the farmer that he'd better stop
And she call her father and he called a
Taxi and got there before very long
'Cause some one was doin' his little girl
Right for a change and so that's why he said
If you marry her son, you're better off single
'Cause it's always been my belief
Marriage will bring a man nothing but
Sweet Violets
Sweeter than the roses
Covered all over from head to toe
Covered all over with sweet violets
The farmer decided he wed anyway
And started in planning for his wedding
Suit which he purchased for only one buck
But then he found out he was just out of
Money and so he got left in the lurch
A standin' and waitin' in front of the
End of the story which just goes to show
All a girl wants from a man is his
Sweet Violets
Sweeter than the roses
Covered all over from head to toe
Covered all over with sweet violets
Sweet Violets﻿

Alan Bold described the 20th century anonymous [[bawdy]] poem about the "young man of Brighton Pier" as "perhaps the finest of the teasing-rhyme variety of bawdy poem".&lt;ref&gt;''The Bawdy Beautiful'', ed. Alan Bold, 1979 {{ISBN|0-7221-1732-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extract will illustrate the technique:

:''One very hot day in the summer last year''
:''A young man was seen swimming round [[Brighton Pier]];''
:''He dived underneath it and swam to a rock''
:''And amused all the ladies by shaking his''
:''Fist at a copper who stood on the shore,''
:''The very same copper who copped him before.''
:''For the policeman to order him out was a farce,''
:''For the cheeky young man simply showed him his''
:''Graceful manoeuvres and wonderful pace...''&lt;ref&gt;''Making Love'', ed. Alan Bold, 1978 {{ISBN|0-330-25585-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]" from ''[[South Park]]'' uses [[enjambment]] to replace taboo words with non-taboo phrases with the same initial syllable. For example ''shit&gt;shih-tzu'' and ''meat&gt;meeting'', in the following fragment, each start a new sentence instead of finishing the old one: 

:I don't want my breakfast, because it tastes like— 
:Shih Tzus make good housepets, they're cuddly and sweet, 
:Monkeys aren't good to have, because they like to beat their—
:Meeting in the office, [...]

Similarly, the childhood rhyme [[Miss Susie|Miss Suzie]] ends each section with what sounds like a taboo word, only to continue with a more innocent word.
:Miss Suzie had a steamboat,
:the steamboat had a bell,
:Miss Suzie went to heaven,
:the steamboat went to
:Hello operator
:please give me number nine [...]

Another example is the 1985 Bowser &amp; Blue song ''Polka-Dot Undies'', which begins:

:I went for a ride in my pickup truck
:I picked up my girl, 'cuz I wanted to
:Show her my gloves, 'cuz she had on her mitts
:And I blushed brightly when she showed me her
:Perfume that she buys whenever Avon calls,
:So I took off my pants, and I showed her my
:Polka-dot undies!
:My polka-dot undies!

==History==
Teasing rhymes have been popular since the 17th century. Though fairly rare in canonical literature, examples of mind rhyme can be found in the work of [[William Shakespeare]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Marianne Moore]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Holdefer Charles (2009) ''’Shaving Cream’ and Other Mind Rhymes'', [[The Antioch Review]], Vol. 67, No. 1, Winter pp. 158-63.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[['Tis the Voice of the Lobster]]'' it is generally assumed that the last words of the interrupted poem could be supplied by the reader as "— eating the Owl".

A '''monodrama''' is a theatrical or [[opera]]tic piece played by a single [[actor]] or singer, usually portraying one character.

== In opera ==
In opera, a monodrama was originally a [[melodrama]] with one role such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Pygmalion (Rousseau)|Pygmalion]]'', which was written in 1762 and first staged in Lyon in 1770, and [[Georg Benda]]'s work of the [[Pygmalion (opera)|same name]] (1779). 

The term monodrama (sometimes '''mono-opera''') is also applied to modern works with a single soloist, such as [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Die glückliche Hand]]'' (1924), which besides the [[protagonist]] has two additional silent roles as well as a [[choir|choral]] prologue and epilogue. ''[[Erwartung]]'' (1909) and ''[[La voix humaine]]'' (1959) closely follow the traditional definition, while in ''[[Eight Songs for a Mad King]]'' (1969) by [[Peter Maxwell Davies]], the instrumentalists are brought to the stage to participate in the action. Twenty-first century examples can be found in ''[[Émilie (opera)|Émilie]]'' (2008) by [[Kaija Saariaho]] and ''Four Sad Seasons Over Madrid'' (2008) or ''God's Sketches'' (2011) both of them by [[Jorge Grundman]].

== In spoken drama ==
In England the first example of monodrama was on a mythological theme, in this case [[Frank Sayers]]' ''Pandora'' (1790),&lt;ref&gt;Lucio Tufano, ''La ricezione italiana del melologo à la Rousseau'', in ''D’un scène à l’autre'', Mardaga 2009, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WhBOZoYbbjMC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=Pandora+++%22monodrama%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Luo0kIlaP_&amp;sig=_3cP6ilGPfz_95OHYoo4F6bqmmg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB4raqsKDZAhXBQ8AKHU-jAqMQ6AEIODAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Pandora%20%20%20%22monodrama%22&amp;f=false p.134]&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of a recitation with off-stage voices. [[Robert Southey]] took up the new form, producing eleven pieces so titled between 1793-1804;&lt;ref&gt;Carrie J. Preston, ''Modernism's Mythic Pose'', Oxford University 2011, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1ir2nGBtcrIC&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;ots=2qvhka0GCn&amp;dq=Frank%20Sayers%20%20%20%22monodrama%22&amp;pg=PA262#v=onepage&amp;q=Frank%20Sayers%20%20%20%22monodrama%22&amp;f=false note 18, p.262]&lt;/ref&gt; so did [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]] in his publicly performed and highly melodramatic ''The Captive''.&lt;ref&gt; George Taylor, ''The French Revolution and the London Stage'', Cambridge University 2000, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E7NJ8-lUp3kC&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;ots=7HdMesWRUQ&amp;dq=M.%20Lewis%20%20%22monodrama%22&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q=M.%20Lewis%20%20%22monodrama%22&amp;f=false pp.110-12]&lt;/ref&gt; Few others actually appeared on stage and monodrama soon lost its connection with music. The term "[[dramatic monologue]]" came to be applied to such works, although the term "monodrama"
remained in critical currency. Half a century later Tennyson himself referred to his ''[[Maud (poem)|Maud]]'' (1855) as a monodrama,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Ricks, Tennyson: a selected edition, Routledge 2014, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-DCiAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA512&amp;dq=Frank%20Sayers%20%20%20monodramas&amp;pg=PA512#v=onepage&amp;q=Frank%20Sayers%20%20%20monodramas&amp;f=false p.512]&lt;/ref&gt; and William Lancaster ([[John Warren, 3rd Baron de Tabley]]) published a verse collection titled ''Eclogues and Monodramas'' in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forgottenbooks.com/en/readbook/EcloguesMonodramas_10203717#0 Forgotten Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, [[Nurul Momen]] (''[[Nemesis (Momen play)|Nemesis]]'', 1944), [[Samuel Beckett]] (''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]'', 1958) and [[Anton Chekhov]] (''[[On the Harmful Effects of Tobacco]]'', 1886, 1902), among others, have written monodramas in this sense. [[Patrick Süskind]] has one person speak to the audience in ''[[Der Kontrabaß]]'' (1981). A more recent example is ''[[A Night in November]]'' (1994) by Irish playwright [[Marie Jones]].

As developed by [[Russian symbolism|Russian symbolist]] [[Nikolai Evreinov]] (1879–1953) and encapsulated in his book ''The Theatre in Life'' (1927), it is a dramatic representation of what passes in an individual mind. Everything one witnesses on stage is portrayed from the mental state of the given protagonist.

The largest solo theatre festival in the world, [[United Solo]] takes place annually in New York City at [[Theatre Row (New York City)|Theatre Row]]. In 2013 it featured over 120 productions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/182782-United-Solo-Theatre-Festival-Featuring-Mina-Samuels-and-Zara-Phillips-Begins-Oct-3 Playbill, Oct. 3, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kiel]], Germany, an international theatre festival for monodramas takes place regularly, the Thespis International Monodrama Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespisfestival.de/ Thespis International Monodrama Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MotionGraphicsAnimation.webm|thumb|Animation in and about motion graphics. In Spanish, with English subtitles]]

'''Motion graphics''' are pieces of digital [[footage]] or [[animation]] which create the [[illusion]] of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] or rotation, and are usually combined with [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] for use in [[multimedia]] projects. Motion graphics are usually displayed via [[electronic media]] technology, but may also be displayed via manual powered technology (e.g. [[thaumatrope]], [[phenakistoscope]], [[stroboscope]], [[zoetrope]], [[praxinoscope]],  [[flip book]]). The term distinguishes still graphics from those with a transforming appearance over time, without over-specifying the form.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Betancourt, The Origins of Motion Graphics, Cinegraphic, January 6, 2012 [http://www.cinegraphic.net/article.php?story=20130306203217744]&lt;/ref&gt; While any form of experimental or abstract animation can be called motion graphics, the term typically more explicitly refers to the commercial application of animation and effects to video, film, TV, and interactive applications.

==Scope of the term==
'''Motion graphics''' extend beyond the most commonly used methods of frame-by-frame footage and animation. Motion graphics can be distinguished from typical animation in that they are not strictly character driven or story based and often represent animated abstract shapes and forms such as logos or logo elements.

==History of the term==
[[File:Alebrijes wikilearning.webm|thumb|Motion graphic clip about [[alebrije]]s created by the [[Museo de Arte Popular]] in Mexico City. Note: Click the CC button for English subtitles.]]
Since there is no universally accepted definition of motion graphics, the official beginning of the art form is disputed. There have been presentations that could be classified as motion graphics as early as the 1800s. [[Michael Betancourt]] wrote the first in depth historical survey of the field, arguing for its foundations in [[visual music]] and the historical abstract films of the 1920s by [[Walther Ruttmann]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Viking Eggeling]] and [[Oskar Fischinger]].&lt;ref&gt;Justin Cone, The History of Motion Graphics, Motionographer.com, February 12, 2013 [http://motionographer.com/2013/02/12/the-history-of-motion-graphics/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of motion graphics is closely related to the history of [[Computer Graphics]] as the new developments of computer generated graphics led to a wider use of motion design not based on optical film animation. The term motion graphics originated with digital [[video editing]] in computing, perhaps to keep pace with newer technology. Graphics for television were originally referred to as Broadcast Design.

One of the first uses of the term "motion graphics" was by animator [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney]], who in 1960 founded a company called Motion Graphics Inc.&lt;ref name="cmu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ph/nyit/masson/history.htm|title="The Computer Graphics Book Of Knowledge"|author=|date=|website=www.cs.cmu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saul Bass]] is a major pioneer in the development of feature film title sequences.  His work included title sequences for popular films such as ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (1955), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), ''Anatomy of a Murder'' (1959), ''North by Northwest'' (1959), ''Psycho'' (1960), and ''Advise &amp;amp; Consent'' (1962).  His designs were simple, but effectively communicated the mood of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Betancourt, Saul Bass – Animating Modernist Design, Cinegraphic, August 28, 2011 [http://www.cinegraphic.net/article.php?story=20110826144209282]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer-generated motion graphics==
Before computers were widely available, motion graphics were costly and time-consuming, limiting their use to high-budget [[filmmaking]] and [[television production]]. Computers began to be used as early as the late 1960s as super computers were capable of rendering crude graphics. John Whitney and [[Charles Csuri]] can be considered early pioneers of computer aided animation.&lt;ref&gt;http://excelsior.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~carlson/history/ID797.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOwyRnZ1oxoC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=cranston/csuri+productions&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JOjDVJHoAarnsAT9rILwCA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=cranston/csuri+productions&amp;f=false|title=Moving Innovation: A History of Computer Animation|first=Tom|last=Sito|date=8 June 2018|publisher=MIT Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s to mid-1990s, expensive proprietary graphics systems such as those from British-based [[Quantel]] were quite commonplace in many [[television station]]s. Quantel workstations such as the Hal, Henry, Harry, Mirage and Paintbox were the broadcast graphics standard of the time. Many other real time graphics systems were used such as Ampex ADO, Abekas and K-Scope for live [[Digital video effect]]s. Early proprietary 3D computer systems were also developed specifically for broadcast design such as the Bosch FGS-4000 which was used in the music video for Dire Straits [[Money for Nothing (song)]]. The advent of more powerful desktop computers running Photoshop in the mid-90s drastically lowered the costs for producing digital graphics.  With the reduced cost of producing motion graphics on a computer, the discipline has seen more widespread use. With the availability of desktop programs such as Adobe [[After Effects]], [[Combustion (software)|Discreet Combustion]], and [[Apple Motion]], motion graphics have become increasingly accessible.  Modern [[character generator]]s (CG) from [[Aston Broadcast Systems]] and [[Chyron Corporation]]'s incorporate motion graphics.

The term "motion graphics" was popularized by Trish and Chris Meyer's book about the use of Adobe [[After Effects]], titled ''Creating Motion Graphics''.  This was the beginning of desktop applications which specialized in video production, but were not editing or 3D programs.  These new programs collected together [[special effects]], [[compositing]], and color correction toolsets, and primarily came between edit and 3D in the production process. This "in-between" notion of motion graphics and the resulting style of animation is why sometimes it is referred to as [[2.5D]].

Motion graphics continue to evolve as an art form with the incorporation of sweeping camera paths and 3D elements. Maxon's [[CINEMA 4D]], plugins such as [[CINEMA 4D|MoGraph]] and Adobe [[After Effects]]. Despite their relative complexity, [[Autodesk]]'s [[Maya (software)|Maya]] and [[3D Studio Max]] are widely used for the animation and design of motion graphics, as is [[Maya (software)|Maya]] and 3D Studio which uses a [[node-based]] [[particle system]] generator similar to [[Cinema 4D]]'s Thinking Particles plugin. There are also some other packages in Open Source panorama, which are gaining more features and adepts in order to use in a motion graphics workflow, while [[Blender (software)|Blender]] integrates several of the functions of its commercial counterparts.

Many motion graphics animators learn several [[3D graphics]] packages for use according to each program's strengths. Although many trends in motion graphics tend to be based on a specific software's capabilities, the software is only a tool the [[broadcast designer]] uses while bringing the vision to life.

Leaning heavily from techniques such as the [[collage]] or the [[pastiche]], motion graphics has begun to integrate many traditional animation techniques as well, including [[stop-motion animation]], [[cel animation]] or a combination of both.

==Particle system==
One of the most popular motion graphics tools is a [[particle system]]: a motion graphics technology that is used for generating multiple animated elements. This type of animation is commonly referred to as procedural animation. A particle system is available as a plug-in, as a stand-alone application, or is included as an integrated part of a motion graphics package. Particles are points in 3-D or 2-D space that can be represented by a wide variety of station and animated objects such as a ball of light, a video clip, or a selection of text, to name a few. The particles are generated by a particle emitter and can be emitted in small numbers or in the thousands, depending on the project. Among other things, a particle emitter can be in the form of a single point, a line, a grid, a plane or an object such as a box or sphere, although it can also make use a custom object to serve an emitter, such as a logo, which for example, can be exploded, melted, or transformed into blowing sand. A popular particle system for motion graphics is Particular by [[Trapcode]].

Other examples of individual particles include a blurred sphere that can be used in large numbers to create smoke or fog and a video clip of a person who can be duplicated to create a crowd scene. Particles can be emitted as a single item, although it is typically used in large numbers, such as when creating smoke or rain. They are controlled by directional forces, simulated wind and gravity, objects designed to attract or repel them. Other controllable attributes can include such things as changes in color, size, or transparency. Depending on the system, one can also combine multiple simultaneous emitters, such as when simulating an explosion that combines fire, smoke and flying debris. In an advanced 3-D system the particle can be used to control an animated articulated character, a recognizable example being the warriors in the battle sequences of the film Lord of the Rings.

==Animation==
Elements of a motion graphics project can be animated by various means, depending on the capabilities of the software. These elements may be in the form of art, text, photos, and video clips, to name a few. The most popular form of animation is [[keyframing]], in which properties of an object can be specified at certain points in time by setting a series of keyframes so that the properties of the object can be automatically altered (or [[Tweening|tweened]]) in the frames between keyframes. Another method involves a behavior system such as is found in [[Apple Motion]] that controls these changes by simulating natural forces without requiring the more rigid but precise keyframing method. Yet another method involves the use of formulas or scripts, such as the expressions function in [[Adobe After Effects]] or the creation of [[ActionScript]]s within [[Adobe Flash]]. Computers are capable of calculating and randomizing changes in imagery to create the illusion of motion and transformation. [[Computer animation]]s can use less information space ([[computer memory]]) by automatically [[tweening]], a process of [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]]ing the key changes of an image at a specified or calculated time. These key poses or frames are commonly referred to as keyframes or low CP. [[Adobe Flash]] uses computer animation tweening as well as '''frame-by-frame''' animation and video.
[[Stop motion]] graphics is the oldest type of motion graphics which has given birth to cinemas&lt;ref&gt;https://www.animate2explain.com/explainer-videos/motion-graphics-videos/&lt;/ref&gt;, it provides unique effect to the videos.

== Motion design and digital compositing software packages ==
{{Main article|Motion graphic design}}
Since motion design is created using images and video sequences, a complementary tool is a 3d software package. [[Maya (software)|Maya]] has new MASH module specially design for motion graphics with lots of nodes for complex but interactive animations and seamlessly exports camera, objects to Adobe After Effects.  [[Cinema 4D]] is widely used for its intuitive interface, layered export to Adobe After Effects, and the additional MoGraph module, but there are other software packages as well. Such packages can generate images or video sequences with an [[alpha channel]], which stores all the transparency information.

Motion design applications include [[Adobe After Effects]], [[Eyeon Fusion]], [[Nuke (software)|Nuke]], [[Autodesk Combustion]], [[Apple Motion]], [[Max/MSP]], various [[VJ (video performance artist)|VJ]] Programs, Smith Micro Software [[Anime Studio]], [[Adobe Flash]], Natron and [[Synfig|Synfig Studio]]. 3D programs used in motion graphics include Maxon [[Cinema 4D]], Autodesk [[3ds Max]] and [[Maya (software)|Maya]], NewTek [[Lightwave]], e-on [[Vue Infinite]] and [[Blender (software)|Blender]]. Motion graphics plug-ins include [[Magic bullet (software)|Magic Bullet]], [[Red Giant Software]] and [[The Foundry Visionmongers]].

'''New Media Distribution/Irjax Enterprises''' was a [[comic book]] [[distributor]] and boutique [[publisher]] active in the 1970s and early 1980s during the growth of the [[direct market]]. After the distribution arm of the company went out of business in 1982, its processing centers and warehouses formed the basis for [[Diamond Comics Distributors]], the now-dominant comics distributor. New Media's publishing arm continued in the business until 1985.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Hal Shuster, his father, Irwin, and his brother, Jack, formed the paper distribution company '''Irjax Enterprises''' (a play on the names "'''Ir'''win" and "'''Jack'''"), based in [[Rockville, Maryland]], in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="DuinDD"/&gt;

=== Entering the direct market ===
After [[Phil Seuling]] established the [[direct market]] in 1972, his company [[Sea Gate Distributors]] maintained a virtual monopoly on comic book distribution, until a lawsuit brought by Irjax in 1978.&lt;ref name="DuinDD"&gt;"Direct Distribution," in Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s). ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998), pp. 126-130.&lt;/ref&gt; Irjax sued the comic book publishers [[DC Comics|DC]], [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], [[Archie Comics|Archie]], and [[Warren Comics|Warren]] for their anti-competitive arrangement with Seagate.&lt;ref&gt;Rozanski, Chuck. [http://www.milehighcomics.com/tales/cbg104.html "Tales From the Database: Chuck Goes to New York Part I,"] Mile High Comics (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the lawsuit Irjax gained "a sizeable chunk of the direct-distribution market,"&lt;ref name="DuinDD"/&gt; with distribution centers in Boston and Tampa.&lt;ref name=Diamond-timeline&gt;[http://www.diamondcomics.com/Home/1/1/3/597?articleID=117735 "Diamond Timeline Chronicles 30 Years of Service &amp; Success,"] [[Diamond Comic Distributors, Inc.]] official website. Accessed Feb. 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Boston-area division was known as '''Solar Spice and Liquors'''&lt;ref&gt;David, Peter. [http://www.peterdavid.net/archives/001238.html "Carol,"] PeterDavid.net (December 11, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; (named after a fictional corporation created by science fiction writer [[Poul Anderson]]).

=== Steve Geppi ===
{{main|Diamond Comic Distributors}}
Meanwhile, Baltimore retailer [[Steve Geppi]] had four comic book stores&lt;ref name="Resume"&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/1997/36/b3543113.htm Resume for "Stephen A. Geppi" at BusinessWeek, September 8, 1998]. Accessed March 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Success"&gt;Warshaw, Michael. "From Mailman to Tycoon," in DeGarmo, Scott (ed.), ''[[SUCCESS (magazine)|Success]]'' (June, 1994), pp. 28–32.&lt;/ref&gt; and was acting as a sub-distributor, "doing a little informal distributing . . . for smaller retailers." By 1981, Geppi was one of New Media/Irjax's biggest accounts.&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; In late 1981, the company, now known as '''New Media Distribution''', or '''New Media/Irjax''', filed for Chapter 11.&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: NM in Trouble, to File for Chapter 11," ''The Comics Journal'' #70 (January 1982), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the "last loyal customers" when New Media began having fiscal difficulties, Geppi made a deal with Shuster: "[t]he owner was going into retail," so Geppi agreed to provide Shuster with "free books for a period of time in return for his account list."&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt;

When Hal Shuster relocated to Florida early in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: New Media Publications Relocates to Florida," ''The Comics Journal'' #71 (March 1982), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; he asked "Geppi to service more accounts for a bigger discount,"&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; thereby effectively selling Geppi the distribution end of the business.&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: New Media Distribution out of Business," ''The Comics Journal'' #72 (May 1982), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Geppi immediately founded [[Diamond Comics Distributors]]. Geppi took over New Media/Irjax's office and warehouse space and had to "sort out the good customers from the bad overnight," negotiating with creditors to continue Shuster's distribution business as Diamond Comic Distributors.&lt;ref name="DuinDiamond"&gt;"Diamond Comic Distributors," in Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s). ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998), pp. 125-126&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing ==
In addition to its distribution business, New Media/Irjax acted as a small publisher from 1976 until 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Bethke, Marilyn. "New Media's Publishing Empire," ''The Comics Journal'' #76 (October 1982), pp. 154-161.&lt;!-- concerns New Media/Irjax, ''Comics Feature'', and ''RBCC'' (''Rocket's Blast Comicollector'')--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Under the names '''Irjax Enterprises''' and then '''New Media Publishing''', it mostly produced periodicals for comics and fantasy/science fiction enthusiasts, the most notable title being ''[[Comics Feature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Headlines: New Media Expands Publishing Base, Comics and Commentary Magazines to Begin!" ''Comics Feature'' #6 (October 1980), pp. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The company also published a few original comic book titles (in the adventure and fantasy genres),&lt;ref&gt;"Headlines: New Media Expands: Heroines, Romance Titles Added," ''Comics Feature'' #12/13 (Sept./Oct. 1981), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; usually featuring creators pulled from the ranks of [[fandom]]. The company published out of [[Largo, Florida]]; [[Tampa, Florida]]; and finally [[Studio City, California]].

Notable names who worked for New Media/Irjax as editors and/or writers include [[Carol Kalish]], [[Kurt Busiek]], and [[Peter B. Gillis]].&lt;ref&gt;"Headlines: NMP Editorial Shake-Up," ''Comics Feature'' #12/13 (Sept./Oct. 1981), p. 18: Peter Gillis leaves New Media Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas''''' is an [[action-adventure video game]] developed by Finnish studio Cornfox &amp; Bros. It focuses on an unnamed boy protagonist's quest to find his lost father and defeat the living fortress, Oceanhorn. It was first released for [[iOS]] in November 2013, and later had ports for [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation Vita]].

The gameplay and graphic design of ''Oceanhorn'' closely follows that of ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' video games, notably ''[[The Wind Waker]]'' and ''[[A Link to the Past]]''.&lt;ref name="Cnet 14 November 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Starr|first=Michelle|title=Oceanhorn: a loving tribute to The Legend of Zelda|url=http://www.cnet.com.au/oceanhorn-a-loving-tribute-to-the-legend-of-zelda-339345957.htm|accessdate=14 November 2013|newspaper=Cnet|date=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players explore dungeons, fight monsters with various weapons, and throw pots and cut bushes to find hidden coins or hearts. The music of ''Oceanhorn'' was composed by Kalle Ylitalo, with a few additional compositions by [[Kenji Ito]] and [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. A sequel, titled ''Oceanhorn 2: Knights of the Lost Realm'', is in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oceanhorn.blogspot.co.il/2016/08/oceanhorn-2-in-development.html|title=Oceanhorn 2 in development!|last=|first=|date=22 August 2016|website=Oceanhorn - The Adventure Game|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The game has a rating of 85 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] for the iOS version of the game, based on 19 critic reviews;&lt;ref name="MCiOS" /&gt; however, the console versions scored substantially lower, with the PS4 and Xbox One versions scoring 66 and 71 on the site, respectively, based on 22 aggregated reviews.{{r|MCPS4|MCXONE}}

That said, critical reactions to the game appear to be positive, with most of the praise going to visuals and music but criticism aimed towards the puzzles and the storylines;. [[CNET]] commented on the iOS version of the game, saying that "if ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' were to come to mobile ... we don't think it could do a better job [than ''Oceanhorn'']",&lt;ref name="Cnet 14 November 2013" /&gt; and ''[[TouchArcade]]'', also speaking on the iOS version of the game, praised the "excellent music, occasional voice-acting, and vibrant, lush 3D graphics," while concluding that the game was "a near-perfect, rendition of ''Zelda''" for mobiles.&lt;ref name="TouchArcade" /&gt;

==Sales==
By October 2016, the game had sold over one million copies across all platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Paget |first=Mat |date=October 14, 2016 |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-like-oceanhorn-sells-1-million-coming-to-a-n/1100-6444485/ |title=Zelda-Like Oceanhorn Sells 1 Million, Coming to "a Nintendo Console" |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prostitution]] is currently legal in [[Honduras]]. Because there is no law prohibiting [[prostitution]], it is a prevalent form of occupation, especially amongst women and teenagers in cities. Although similar institutions such as brothel ownership and pimping are illegal, prostitution has remained largely unchecked by the government. [[UNAIDS]] estimate there to be 22,771 prostitutes in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex workers: Population size estimate - Number, 2016 |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/dv/PivotData_2018_7_22_636678151733621264.htm |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lack of enforcement of current laws has created a profitable business out of prostitution - one in which both adults and children are a part. There are many causes to the high rates of involvement amongst the women and teens in cities, but the main reason is the high poverty levels. Participants see sex work as a viable option to escape poverty.

Unfortunately, prostitution poses risks to these sex workers, especially in terms of mental, physical, and sexual health effects. There are also worldwide effects due to prostitution out of Honduras and similar countries in [[Central America]]. 

Honduras has tried to curb these effects but has yet to find a stable solution, despite numerous policy recommendations.

== Effects of Adult Prostitution ==

=== Mental and Physical Effects ===
According to a study, many commercial sex workers in cities, both men and women, are exposed to sexual and physical violence. 71.4% of street workers were exposed to violence/physical danger and almost 90% were exposed to sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Rio Navarro, Javier, Julien Cohen, Eva Rocillo Arechaga, and Edgardo Zuniga. 2012. “Physical and sexual violence, mental health indicators, and treatment seeking among street-based population groups in Tegucigalpa, Honduras” ''Revista Panamericana De Salud Publica'' 31, no. 5: 388-395. ''Academic Search Premier'', EBSCO''host'' (accessed March 2, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; On top of this, 73.5% of victims were physically abused in their childhood, which shows the origins of such mental and physical effects. For some workers, a lifestyle of abuse and exploitation is all they know.

Another important aspect is the correlation between prostitution and drug use amongst sex workers. In the same study, nearly 1 in 4 commercial sex workers abuse [[cocaine]], which as a recreational drug, has its own physical effects.

In terms of mental effects, 63.3% of Commercial sex workers have reported having suicidal behavior in life; this percentage was even higher amongst the women. It is clear that prostitution in Honduran urban centers has created negative mental health issues among those who work in the field.

=== Sexual Effects of Prostitution ===
Contrary to the belief that prostitution equates to high levels of HIV/[[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], a medical report&lt;ref&gt;Ditmore, M. H. (2006). ''Encyclopedia of prostitution and sex work''. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; from 2006 states that only “2.4%” of its sample size of 790 female sex workers had HIV. They attribute this low number to the increase in the use of protection among sex workers. In fact, government STI prevention programs have been implemented since the early 2000s in cities across Honduras. Because prostitution is prolific in cities, these programs have proven extremely effective in reducing numbers of HIV incidents.

== Child Prostitution ==
[[File:Map of Central America.png|thumb|Map of Central America|400x400px]]
Honduras has tried, unsuccessfully, to curb [[Child prostitution|Child Prostitution]] in its country. Lax laws have turned child prostitution into a business that has created prostitution rings both within the country and trafficking to other countries, including the US. 

Unfortunately, the business continues to grow as children participate in sex work as a means of surviving.

Although this article is specific to Honduras, child prostitution can be viewed in [[Central America]] as a whole, because of the networks of prostitution rings from as north as southern Mexico to as south as Costa Rica.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Beyer, N. (2001). ''The Sex Tourism Industry Spreads to Costa Rica and Honduras: Are These Countries Doing Enough to Protect Their Children from Sexual Exploitation''. Ga. J. Int'l &amp; Comp. L.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Guinn, David E., and Elissa Steglich. 2003. ''In modern bondage: Sex trafficking in the americas : National and regional overview of central america and the caribbean : Belize, costa rica, dominican republic, el salvador, guatemala, Honduras, ''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Causes of Child Prostitution ===
The first cause is poverty. Prostitution becomes a source of economic opportunity where there is a space of economic regression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Surprisingly, many children who go into prostitution are forced by the parents in order to provide for the family, hence there were high levels of reported abuse in sex workers' childhoods. In a country where there are low literacy rates in rural areas, there is little opportunity to gain economic prosperity through education. 

Exploiting this reality, sex-tourist agents go to the countryside to find these children and contract them out for work. The agents pay the parents large sums of money up front in exchange for contractual labour done by their children. Modern day slavery.

Another cause is the promise for a better lifestyle. Some children willingly participate in the child prostitution industry because they believe the quality of life would be better than it was before. There were even reports of some sex workers believing they would get trafficked into a better country where they could start anew.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Unfortunately, Some children are homeless or surrounded by gang activity and find similar outlets to survive.

Another large issue that is rarely mentioned is the influence gender roles in prostitution. Women in Honduras are seen as sexual objects and treated as such. This is why violence levels are so high against sex workers, especially women. Because these women are fundamentally seen as passive objects for a man's pleasure, they are dehumanized and treated as less than human.

=== Effects of Sex Work on Children ===
There dangerous physical effects of sex work on children. They live in terrible conditions and are poorly fed, due to their contractors. They are also physically abused by these contractors if they do not deliver well on their jobs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are also extreme mental effects of sex work on children. Children suffer from mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression, but also a lack of confidence and self-worth because they are used as tools. Children have been found to struggle from [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder]] after they have grown up, because of their experience when younger.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In terms of health effects, children are more likely to suffer from life-threatening illnesses such as tuberculosis and HIV due to the amount of exposure to others in the work and the immaturity of their bodies. Additionally, they are more susceptible to transferring illnesses (STIs) due to how easily their genitals can break.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Sex Tourism ===
[[Sex tourism]] is an issue that is tied to child prostitution because of the large demand by older, adult men. First world western men come to major Honduran cities like Tegucigalpa in order to have sex with minors because it is legal and cheap. The demand of these men further spurs the business, and is the reason for the creation of the sex work contractors.

Although pimping is considered illegal, it is still done and an industry has arisen through illegal tourism. Alongside child prostitution, there is also sex trafficking; that is the global selling of human bodies to be bought for sexual purposes, usually without the initial consent of the person who is being moved.

== Sex Trafficking ==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Honduras}}
Because of a low-cost and available population, trafficking has occurred both in and out of Honduras. These rings have extended their reach to even the United States. Here are a few reasons why sex trafficking occurs.

The first reason is deceit. Sex workers are lured with the promise of a better life, and are sold to wealthy people in the United States.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Golob, T. A. (2014). ''Human trafficking from southern mexico, Honduras, el salvador, and guatemala: Why these victims are trafficked into modern day florida ''(Order No. 1555111). Available from ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global. (1530474424).&lt;/ref&gt; On top of this, those already in the industry voluntarily go to the United States because there is the opportunity for better.&lt;ref&gt;Trafficking in Honduras. (2010, September). Retrieved March 09, 2017, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.protectionproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Honduras.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason is government corruption. Although trafficking is illegal, countries have reported government officials helping to smuggle persons and drafting fake documents to facilitate such smuggling.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Honduras as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Honduras 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282668.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current Government Action / Policy ==
Honduras has struggled to make effective government policy to combat this issue. The country planned to implement a National Plan of Action to Eradicate Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, but the plan never came to fruition.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;UNICEF. (2015). ''Prevention of Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents: Contributing to a Sustainable Tourism in Central America''. Panama City, Panama: Child Protection Section.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Monumento al Niño - UNICEF.jpg|thumb|400x400px|Monumento al Niño UNICEF]]
The United Nations, the United States, and other international bodies have recommended policy to end child prostitution and sex trafficking. The number one policy to be put in place is ensuring safe and viable routes to economic prosperity, which means increasing access to education. Other Central American countries such as Costa Rica have put in educational measures to ensure their young citizens have access to academic and career opportunity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

There is also the need for child protection services. This means a legal and societal framework to stop traffickers from recruiting these children - support through laws and the community. This policy is outlined in a report on child prostitution in Honduras by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]]. Honduras has taken these policies into consideration, but whether they are realized remains to be seen.

Additionally, [[Non-governmental organization]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s like Casa Alianza and the International Labour Organization’s International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour have created programs working alongside the Honduran Government to tackle this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Maalla M’jid, N. (n.d.). ''Report of the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography'' (United Nations Human RIghts Council).&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent report by the UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and SAWA-All the Women Together Today and Tomorrow, a Palestinian NGO, suggests that an increasing number of women are taking up prostitution in the face of poverty and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Rare report on prostitution in Palestinian territories|work= [[Jerusalem Post]]|date=|url= http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Rare-report-on-prostitution-in-Palestinian-territories |accessdate=2009-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sawa.ps/Upload/Reports/english.pdf|format=PDF|title=Trafficking and Forced Prostitution of Palestinian Women and Girls : Forms of Modern Day Slavery|website=Sawa.ps|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Perceptions of sexual risk behavior among Palestinian youth in the West Bank: a qualitative investigation|first1=Salwa G|last1=Massad|first2=Rita|last2=Karam|first3=Ryan|last3=Brown|first4=Peter|last4=Glick|first5=Mohammed|last5=Shaheen|first6=Sebastian|last6=Linnemayr|first7=Umaiyeh|last7=Khammash|date=24 November 2014|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=14|pages=1213|accessdate=|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-1213|pmid=25420532|pmc=4247558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], there were no laws on prostitution.&lt;ref name="city"&gt;{{cite book|last1=García|first1=Magaly Rodríguez|last2=van Voss|first2=Lex Heerma|last3=Nederveen Meerkerk|first3=Elise van|title=Selling Sex in the City: A Global History of Prostitution, 1600s-2000s|date=21 Sep 2017|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-9004346246|pages=337–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After coming under [[United Kingdom|British]] control during [[WW1]], the attitude of the Authorities towards prostitution reflected those of Britain. Ordinances were issued in 1925 (under [[High Commissioner]] [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]]) and 1927 (under [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Herbert Plumer]] introduced laws on prostitution similar to those in Britain. Soliciting, living off the earnings of prostitutes and the keeping of brothels were outlawed.&lt;ref name="city" /&gt;

There is evidence that in [[WW2]], military authorities regulated brothels for soldiers, including medical examinations.&lt;ref name="city" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6218">'''''New Year No Limits''''' was an annual [[Television in the United States|American television]] special that aired on [[ESPN]] from December 31, 2007 until January 1, 2012. It was created, hosted and sponsored by [[Red Bull]].  The program usually aired after the [[Peach Bowl|Chick-fil-A Bowl]] (around 11 PM) until 1 AM [[Eastern time]].

==2007==
The 2007 version originated from the [[Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].  [[Joe Tessitore]], [[Mark Schlereth]], Cam Steele, and [[Jamie Little]] were the commentators.

On this show, [[freestyle motocross]] rider [[Robbie Maddison]] set a new world record for the longest jump on a motorcycle, jumping 322 feet, 7½ inches.  He then made a second attempt, largely because his personal goal was 360 feet.  He failed in that attempt, and in fact the second jump was slightly shorter.

Maddison jumped above a makeshift [[American football#Field|football field]] set up in the Rio's [[parking lot]], which was used to provide a perspective of the distance.

The show was also scheduled to feature the first-ever backflip in an [[off-road racing|off-road truck]], performed by [[Rhys Millen]], best known for his skills as a [[Drifting (motorsport)|drifting]] race car driver.  However, he suffered a [[back injury]] in his final warm-up jump when the truck overshot safety barriers.  Millen did speak to Schlereth by telephone.

In the original plan, Maddison was to have jumped shortly after midnight ET and Millen's flip was set for 3 a.m. ET.  However, because of the [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] finish of the [[2007 Chick-fil-A Bowl|Chick-fil-A Bowl]] that preceded it, and as a safety precaution due to [[headwind]]s at the site, Maddison did not jump until approximately 12:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. (9:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. Dec. 31 in Las Vegas).  ''[[SportsCenter]]'', which was set as interstitial programming, then followed at 1:10&amp;nbsp;a.m. ET and was re-run in its entirety in place of the canceled Millen stunt.

[[Angels and Airwaves]] performed at the end of the show.

Early promotions indicated that ''New Year No Limits'' was presented by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], the distributor of the upcoming [[mockumentary]] release ''[[The Poughkeepsie Tapes]]'', though the sponsorship was dropped when MGM decided to shelve that film (which would not be released in any form until 2014).

==2008==
The 2008 New Year No Limits jump once again featured Maddison, and this time the off-road attempt to backflip a truck by Millen was once again on the plan, with the popular Kiwi racer on the docket on the undercard before the motorcycle jump.

At 8:30 PM [[Pacific time|PT]], Millen performed the backflip on the truck, launching at 36 MPH, traveled 80 feet at a height of 50 feet, and landed hard on all four wheels before the truck then rolled.

Shortly after the stroke of the new year in the Eastern time zone (about 35 minutes later), Maddison successfully connected on a ten-story high jump landing on top of a replica of the Arc de Triomphe at a Las Vegas casino.  While that was successful, he lacerated his left hand on the ensuing 60' drop.

==2009==
The 2009 New Year No Limits moved west to [[Long Beach, California]], where [[Travis Pastrana]], a four-time Rally America champion and part-time WRC driver, jumped a [[Subaru Impreza]] STI rally car off the Pine Avenue pier, soaring 269 feet on Rainbow Harbor, and landed on a floating barge shortly after 9 PM Pacific time.  He celebrated by hitting a back flip off the landing ramp into Rainbow Harbor.

==2010==
The 2010 New Year No Limits was planned to move to [[San Diego, California]], where [[Levi LaVallee]], a seven-time [[Winter X Games]] medalist and champion snocross racer, was to attempt to jump his Polaris snowmobile longer than ever before and eclipse the current record of 301 feet. The event would have taken place at the Embarcadero Marina Park in the Port of San Diego. Embarcadero is Spanish for “landing place,” making it an appropriate location for LaVallee’s jump.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redbullusa.com/cs/Satellite/en_US/Article/levi-lavallee-new-year-no-limits-021242924451090&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday December 17, Red Bull officially announced that Levi Lavallee was injured during a practice run and would be unable to make his record setting attempt during the special telecast. As a result, there was no New Year, No Limits event for 2010. During the practice sessions leading up to the event Levi managed to land a record setting 361 foot jump shattering the old record of 301{{frac|1|2}} feet. Since the official event for the attempt did not take place the practice run has been submitted for the official world record title.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redbullusa.com/cs/Satellite/en_US/Article/new-year-no-limits-cancelled-021242938812071&lt;/ref&gt; An episode of [[SportsCenter]] aired in place of ''New Year No Limits''.

==2011==
The 2011 edition of ''New Year No Limits'' featured LaVallee making a second attempt at crossing [[San Diego Bay]] while [[Robbie Maddison]] attempted to do the same on a [[motorcycle]]; the two attempts took place side-by-side. The event was televised on ESPN and was also broadcast on the Internet via [[ESPN3]].

LaVallee set a new World Record unofficially during his jump landing at a distance of 412&amp;nbsp;ft. Robbie Maddison landed his jump at 378&amp;nbsp;ft, 9 inches also an unofficial World Record, but short of his stated goal of 400&amp;nbsp;ft.

==Cancellation==
The program would not air in 2012 into 2013, and was effectively cancelled with the launch of the [[College Football Playoff]] on ESPN in 2014, which effectively monopolized New Year's Eve and New Year's Day with bowl programming rather than a need for counterprogramming.

[[File:Zazel (tall crop).jpg|thumb|upright|Zazel posing with her cannon at the [[Royal Aquarium]], in 1877]]
'''Rossa Matilda Richter''' (1863–8 December 1937) was an English [[aerialist]] and [[actor]] who became the first [[human cannonball]] at the age of 14. She began performing at a very young age, practicing aerial stunts like [[tightrope walking]] in an old [[London]] church. She took up [[ballet]], [[gymnastics]], and [[trapeze]] by the time she was 6 and, at 12, went on tour with a travelling [[acrobat]] troupe. In 1877, using the stage name '''Zazel''', she was the first person to be fired out of a cannon, in front of a large crowd at the [[Royal Aquarium]].

Journalists and the public voiced concerns for her safety from the time of her earliest appearances as Zazel. She was named by a lawmaker as one of the reasons for proposed legislation in England to prevent dangerous acrobatic stunts, leading her to take the show to the United States. She toured Europe and North America with [[circus]]es including [[Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Barnum &amp; Bailey]], executing tightrope, trapeze, and high dive routines in addition to the human cannonball. Throughout her career, she suffered several accidents and injuries, the most serious of which largely ended her career in 1891. 

During time off from the circus, she started an opera company with her husband and took singing roles in some of its productions. She also volunteered time writing and holding exhibitions to promote the life-saving potential for [[safety net]]s. 

==Early life==
Richter was born in [[London]] in 1863 to parents from [[Dresden]].&lt;ref name=tyson/&gt; Her father, Ernst Richter, was a well known [[talent agent]] who supplied performers and animals to circuses and other productions.&lt;ref name=clipper12may1888/&gt;&lt;ref name=ward/&gt;&lt;ref name=truth/&gt; Her mother, Susanne Richter, was a dancer in a circus.&lt;ref name=ward/&gt; She had at least one sibling&amp;mdash;an older sister.&lt;ref name=bystander/&gt; As a child, she was taught how to fall before she was taught how to perform, practising in an old condemned church in London, where her wire stretched from the [[chancel]] down through the nave to the gallery, and her nets spread below.&lt;ref name="westaustralian" /&gt;

She began her performance career at the age of four or five, playing one of [[Cinderella]]'s sisters in a [[pantomime]] at the Raglan Music Hall.&lt;ref name="truth" /&gt; She was only filling in for another child who had fallen ill, but according to the ''[[New York Clipper]]'', "she filled the role so well that she became a favorite" and gave a series of additional performances at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] theatre.&lt;ref name="clipper12may1888" /&gt;&lt;ref name="truth" /&gt; She received [[ballet]] lessons from a respected instructor and subsequently took up [[gymnastics]], learning from teachers named Stergenbach and the Levanti brothers.&lt;ref name="truth" /&gt; She also became active as a [[trapeze]] artist from the time she was six years old, performing for the first time at [[Garrick Theatre (Leman St)|Garrick Theatre]] in [[Whitechapel]]. She became known for a "leap-for-life" stunt on the trapeze which she performed throughout her career.&lt;ref name="westaustralian" /&gt; During some of these early performances, she used the stage name '''La Petite Lulu'''.&lt;ref name="tyson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="truth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bl" /&gt; 

When she was twelve she joined a travelling Japanese or Siamese [[acrobat]] troupe, with whom she honed her balancing skills that she would rely upon throughout her circus career.&lt;ref name="clipper12may1888" /&gt;&lt;ref name="truth" /&gt; They travelled to put on shows in [[Dublin]], [[Marseilles]], and [[Toulouse]].&lt;ref name="truth" /&gt; According to the ''Clipper'', "she was known as the only Japanese girl that ever visited Europe, and received many medals as rewards for her daring and skill."&lt;ref name="clipper12may1888" /&gt; During the show in Toulouse she suffered the first of many accidents during a performance, falling during a trapeze act. Her injury was severe enough that it took her away from performing for a short time.&lt;ref name="tyson" /&gt; According to her father, it was because he would not sanction further performances.&lt;ref name="truth" /&gt; Richter returned home to London in 1873.

{{quote box|align=right|width=33%|quote = The young lady crawls into a huge mortar&amp;mdash;a most realistic-looking weapon&amp;mdash;with the greatest nonchalance, and, instead of shuddering, we applaud most heartily, and then proceed to watch and to wait with almost breathless eagerness. We follow the progress of the torch for a moment only. We listen to the loud report which follows its application to the powder, and lo! our vision is startled by the sight of a living missile flying through space, and alighting safe and sound in the huge net spread to receive her. Before the smoke has cleared from the vast mouth of the cannon whence she has come she has made her way along the net, and is bowing and smiling upon the stage.|source = ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', as quoted in the ''[[New York Clipper]]'', 6 October 1877&lt;ref name=clipper6october1877/&gt;}}

The [[human cannonball]] act was conceived by [[William Leonard Hunt]], a Canadian [[stunt performer|daredevil]] who went by the name "The Great Farini." He was known both for his own [[high wire]] performances, such as when he crossed [[Niagara Falls]], and for the high-profile performers he managed.&lt;ref name=ward/&gt;&lt;ref name=vam/&gt; Before Richter, Farini's best known act was his adopted son Samuel Wasgate.&lt;ref name=vam/&gt; Starting in 1870, Farini dressed him in women's clothing and began advertising performances for "The Beautiful Lulu the girl Aerialist and Circassian Catapultist."&lt;ref name=vam/&gt; The Lulu act was very successful, and became known for stunts which involved Wasgate being launched by [[catapult]], either into a net or up to a trapeze.&lt;ref name=clipper6october1877/&gt;&lt;ref name=vam/&gt; It was not until a serious accident sent him to the hospital that his true identity became known.&lt;ref name=vam/&gt;&lt;ref name=taitbook/&gt; Lulu's catapult act led Farini to conceive of a cannon-based act. In 1871, years before its first public display, he filed a patent in the US for "certain new and useful Apparatus for Projecting Persons and Articles into or through the Air."&lt;ref name=patent1/&gt; When the [[Royal Aquarium]] in London hired him to improve its profitability, he did so through spectacular acts like the human cannonball.&lt;ref name=berton/&gt;

Ernst Richter was familiar with Farini, and had years prior sworn that he "should never have a dog of mine, much less a daughter, for his dangerous performances. What, indeed, would the [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] say to Farini firing off even a donkey from a cannon?"&lt;ref name=truth/&gt; Suzanne Richter was not so protective, however, and Ernst said she got him to sign an agreement with Farini by misleading him to believe it was not with Farini but one of Ernst's friends, and that Rossa would only be singing and dancing.&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;

In April 1877, the 14-year-old Richter became the first human cannonball, performing as "Zazel, the Beautiful Human Cannonball."&lt;ref name=bl/&gt;&lt;ref name=taitbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=huffpo/&gt; The ''Mackay Mercury'' wrote that the event "hurled her from the jaws of death into the arms of fame."&lt;ref name=mackaymercury/&gt; She was fired out of a spring-style cannon, travelling through the air and landing in a net. Accounts of the event vary on the distance she traveled, between {{convert|6.1|m|ft}} and {{convert|21.3|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=bl/&gt;&lt;ref name=taitbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=huffpo/&gt; The cannon used rubber springs to limit the distance she would travel. Although Farini had filed another patent in England in 1875 (and in the US in 1879) for an "adaptation [of the cannon] so as to use explosives as a means for releasing the catch," a [[gunpowder]]-based explosion was used only for effect during the show.&lt;ref name=bl/&gt;&lt;ref name=patent2/&gt;

Most sources, including the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'', cite Richter as the first human cannonball.&lt;ref name=guinness/&gt; However, the claim has been contested by others who claim that "The Australian Marvels," Ella Zuila and George Loyal, performed the act a few years earlier.&lt;ref name=gizmodo/&gt; Zuila and Loyal were hired by [[Adam Forepaugh]], an American circus owner who learned that his rival, Barnum, may bring Richter to North America. The duo were a featured attraction in Forepaugh's circus and drew comparisons to Richter for their similar aerial stunts. Their cannonball stunts differed somewhat in that rather than being fired from a cannon into a net, Loyal was projected from the cannon and caught by Zuila, who would be hanging upside down with her knees over the bar of a trapeze.&lt;ref name=taitbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=libraryofaustralia/&gt;&lt;ref name=taitchapter/&gt;

Richter was featured at the Aquarium for an extended period of time, performing sometimes twice in a day, and often to a full room of people. The show could draw tens of thousands of people to a single performance. Farini also brought her to perform at other venues in western Europe.&lt;ref name=taitbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=peacockchapter/&gt;&lt;ref name=billboard5december1931/&gt; Louis Cooke wrote in ''The Billboard'' that "the breathless silence that always preceded the act while it was being prepared only added to its intensity, and the graceful bow of the young lady who had the temerity and muscular strength to withstand the shock and presence of mind to guide her flight never failed to receive a round of rapturous applause."&lt;ref name=billboard18december1920/&gt; A writer for ''The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News'' wrote a gushing review of the act, after seeing it multiple times, in the 26 May 1877 issue. It praised "her unhesitating confidence, the graceful ease and swiftness of her motions, together with her placidly smiling face, [which] destroy all sense of fear for her safety in the minds of the audience, and enable them to enjoy the spectacle of her extraordinary agility, strength, and seemingly terribly daring feats, with none but pleasurable, although strongly excited sensations."&lt;ref name=illustrated/&gt; The author went on to describe the mix of anxiety and delight an audience member should expect to experience, and noted that she counted among her fans future king [[Edward VII]], who reportedly attended two of her shows when he was [[Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref name=illustrated/&gt;

Music often accompanied her performances. At the Aquarium, musical director Charles Dubois composed [[waltz]]es for her, which featured prominently in some of the show's advertising.&lt;ref name=taitbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=gsarchive/&gt; Farini also wrote a song, "Zazel," which was sung by [[George Leybourne]] and published by Musical Bouquet.&lt;ref name=vam2/&gt;

The human cannonball was not her only act. She also began performing a high dive at around the same time, also at the Aquarium. For that stunt she would jump from a raised platform into a net, gradually increasing the distance over time until reaching a peak of {{convert|29.6|m|ft}}. The ''West Australian'' wrote that she would start atop the [[proscenium arch]], fall {{convert|27.4|m|ft}} into the net, then pop up to smile at the audience.&lt;ref name=westaustralian/&gt; She also walked the [[tightrope]], increasing the difficulty by sometimes forgoing the standard balancing pole. She would also perform tricks, such as running, standing on one foot, putting baskets on her feet, lying down or sitting on the wire, spinning around while holding it with her knees, and finally jumping off, falling down about {{convert|30|m|ft}} into a net.&lt;ref name=ward/&gt;&lt;ref name=taitbook/&gt; ''The Era'' wrote that the dive was "astounding" and that "she is wonderfully clever and graceful" on the tightrope.&lt;ref name=clipper6october1877/&gt;

==Accidents and public response==
{{quote box|width=33%|source=''[[Truth (British periodical)|Truth]]'', 22 May 1879&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;|quote=This ought not to be permitted in a country calling itself civilised. We complain of the Spaniards attending [[bull-fights]], and yet what does a matador, a picador, or a bandillero do, but place himself in a position in which he pins his safety on his skill? Were, however, in Spain children to be hired by speculators and forced to fight in the bull-ring, there would be a universal outcry. And yet we in England allow&amp;mdash;nay, we patronise&amp;mdash;the exhibition of a child precipitating herself from a great height, or being shot from a cannon for the benefit of a speculator.}}

Once the human cannonball act started and became popular, people began protesting the perceived danger of the show and tried unsuccessfully to have it stopped.&lt;ref name=tyson/&gt;&lt;ref name=peacockchapter/&gt; Concerned complaints made their way to the [[Home Secretary]], [[Richard Assheton Cross]], who told the Aquarium's manager, Wybrow Robertson, that he would be accountable should an accident befall Richter. In response, Robertson invited Cross to be fired out of the cannon himself.&lt;ref name=hibbert/&gt;

Richter's first human cannonball accident was at the Aquarium, followed by another in [[Portsmouth, United Kingdom|Portsmouth]] in 1879, where the net used to catch her was rotten due to wear and she fell through.&lt;ref name=tyson/&gt; Though she did not break any bones, her condition was serious enough that she could not perform the next day.&lt;ref name=ward/&gt; ''The Citizen'' wrote about the outrage expressed at the apparently sloppy safety checks that had missed the poor condition of the net: "If the public demands such sickening exhibitions ... then most certainly it is the bounden duty of those in authority to see that the precaution is a reality, and not a farce."&lt;ref name=ward/&gt; ''[[The Graphic]]'' insisted "When will the Home Secretary be made to see the necessity of putting some restraint upon the suicidal sensational acrobatic feats, which are now, to our shame, be it said, so popular?"&lt;ref name=ward/&gt; An 1880 issue of ''The Orchestra'' likewise scolded audiences, saying that these acts "prove the morbid taste of the public who delight in such exhibitions."&lt;ref name=orchestra/&gt;

After the Portsmouth accident, Ernst Richter went to the office of the periodical ''[[Truth (British periodical)|Truth]]'' to talk to one of its writers. It had published the opinion that someone ought to prevent her from performing such a dangerous act, and Ernst came to ask them how he could do just that. He was afraid for her safety and wanted to get her away from Farini and his stunts. By that time, Ernst had left the entertainment business, worked as an engineer, and had separated from Susanna, with whom Rossa lived and who raised no such objections to the potential for danger.&lt;ref name=ward/&gt;&lt;ref name=truth/&gt; Ernst said that "the newspapers say that someone ought to interfere to hinder her from risking her life for money. I am her father, and want to interfere ... When the cannon is fired off, her limbs have to be rigid. If by mistake it is fired one moment too soon, she might be killed. When she takes her dive, if she did not fall lightly, she would break a limb; and if the net underneath is rotten, as it was at Portsmouth, she might be killed."&lt;ref name=ward/&gt; The ''Truth'' reporter admitted he did not know much about the law, but said he should talk to a [[magistrate]] to ask how to get an [[injunction]], opining that the justice system should indeed "prevent girls and children from risking their limbs in order that, with or without the consent of their parents, their task-masters may deserve profit."&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;

Later the same year, on 15 December 1879, she fell during a trapeze performance in [[Chatham, Kent]]. The ''New York Clipper'' reported that the net seemed not to be much protection in the spot she landed, and she "was in an apparently senseless condition", exclaiming "I am killed, I am killed!" as she was taken away from the performing area. She was not found to be seriously injured and later performed again with her hands bandaged, "and evidently suffering from great nervousness."&lt;ref name=clipper10january1880/&gt;

In 1880 [[Edward Jenkins (MP)|Edward Jenkins]] brought the Acrobats and Gymnasts' Bill to the [[House of Commons]], which aimed to prevent dangerous acrobatic stunts. There was some push-back to the idea based on the notion that it might also prohibit less dangerous acrobatic performances, to which Jenkins clarified that it really had a handful of performers in mind, including Zazel. There was extended debate across two parliaments, much of it focused on how to draw the line between dangerous and acceptable acts.&lt;ref name=ward/&gt; Many years later, Richter gave her opinion of the legal interventions in an interview with John Squire, eventually published in ''Solo &amp; Duet'': "A lot of those interfering men in Parliament started a committee about it and they passed a law forbidding me to do it. Oh, I was wretched! ... I loved it. They'd just no right to take away me living if I loved it. I was ambitious. I wanted to be great. You see, it was me art."&lt;ref name=ward/&gt;

==Touring with Barnum &amp; Bailey and other circuses==
The relationship between Richter and Farini was nearer to manager-employee than collaborators, and Farini kept most of the earnings from the lucrative shows, amounting to 120–200 [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]] per week.&lt;ref name=hibbert/&gt;&lt;ref name=peacockbook/&gt; In 1879, a reporter observed that when travelling to different venues, she did so with a normal train ticket: "it might have been supposed that those who derive rich benefits from the clever but dangerous performances ... would have paid for her the very small difference between a first- and second-class ticket from [[Sloane Square]] to [[St. James's Park]]."&lt;ref name=circularnotes/&gt; According to [[P. T. Barnum]], who had travelled to London to see the performance, Richter pleaded with him to take her away. She was upset at the small share of money she received from Farini, when she was the star of the act and took the physical risks.&lt;ref name=memorypalace/&gt;

Farini made it well known that the Zazel act belonged to him, publicizing notices to that effect.&lt;ref name=clipper8april1882/&gt; When Richter began asking for more money, he secretly began training additional young women to perform as Zazel.&lt;ref name=hibbert/&gt;&lt;ref name=clipper2october1915/&gt; It is unclear when and to what extent the other "Zazels" performed, but the number of acts using that name became common enough that Richter began to refer to herself as "the original Zazel."&lt;ref name=clipper12may1888/&gt;&lt;ref name=hibbert/&gt; 

In 1880, during proceedings concerning the Acrobats and Gymnasts' Bill, Farini and Richter left England.&lt;ref name=ward/&gt; She performed with the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] for a season, performing in France and then the United States.&lt;ref name=bl/&gt;&lt;ref name=memorypalace/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=billboard14september1929/&gt; Her 8 April 1880 debut in New York "was in every way successful, and received fervid applause," according to the ''Clipper''.&lt;ref name=clipper17april1880/&gt; Though she was best known as a human cannonball, Richter continued to perform other aerial acts, like the high dive and trapeze. She returned to Europe with Farini in November 1881, stayed a short time, and returned to the United States in 1882, touring with John B. Doris's Inter-Ocean Show.&lt;ref name=clipper12november1881/&gt;

==Opera==
Richter married [[George Oscar Starr]], who worked as a press agent for Barnum; and, together, they took some time away from the circus. Among other activities, they launched the Starr Opera Company in 1886. They intended it to be accessible to a popular audience, and even staged a concert for people incarcerated at Michigan State Prison.&lt;ref name=brisbane/&gt; Though it had been reported that she sang a song called "It Is So Easy" after certain circus performances, she was not previously known for singing.&lt;ref name=clipper6october1877/&gt; Nonetheless, she played various parts in comic opera, including a performances as Regina in ''[[La princesse de Trébizonde]]'' and Eliza in ''[[Billee Taylor|Billee Taylor, or The Reward of Virtue]]''. According to the ''Clipper'', she "showed that she had not only an excellent voice, but the grace and action which only long experience and study can give the artist."&lt;ref name=clipper12may1888/&gt;

==Return to circus life and public safety education==
{{multiple image|align=right|total_width=400|image1=Zazel, Sensational Gymnast.jpg|image2=Zazel, the Aerialist.jpg|footer=Portraits of Richter on the cover of ''[[New York Clipper]]'' in October 1877 (left) and May 1888 (right).|footer_align=center}}
When George Starr was offered a position as managing director of Barnum &amp; Bailey, she decided to reenter circus life. She also began using her expertise to educate the public and public safety workers about the usefulness and potential of safety nets, for example to catch people jumping out of burning buildings.&lt;ref name="mackaymercury" /&gt; Dressed in normal clothing, including jewellery and a hat, she would throw herself out of a building window into a net.&lt;ref name="clipper12may1888" /&gt; An 1892 edition of ''The West Australian'' describes one such exhibition: "There was never a more fearless woman gymnast than this Zazel, who jumped nonchalantly from a fourth storey window into a net to illustrate the possibilities of the net as a means of saving life. She tied a stout cord about her skirts, and throwing her head up and backward, she sprang to the centre of the net as confidently and as gracefully as my lady springs from her carriage."&lt;ref name="westaustralian" /&gt;

She volunteered her time to advocate for the use of nets as life-saving tools for several years. In addition to performing stunts, she wrote on the subject for people who live in large buildings and worked with ''The Evening Sun'' to publicise her ideas, sparking conversation throughout the US. According to the ''Clipper'', "she received the thanks of the [[New York Fire Department]] for her bravery and advice, and the press unite in editorially praising her actions."&lt;ref name=clipper12may1888/&gt;

In 1891, while touring the United States with Adam Forepaugh's circus, she nearly died during a show in [[New Mexico]]. She performed with the cannon as well as on a tight wire. The wire was about 40 feet off the ground, running from the side of the circus tent to two poles braced together in the centre, fit with a platform. According to a witness interviewed in the ''Mackay Mercury'', the poles were supposed to be fastened together with a steel band, but it was accidentally left off. When she was out on the wire, starting to put up an umbrella, she signalled to her coworkers, who thought she wanted them to tighten the wire. When they did so, the poles came apart and Richter fell to the ground. She landed on her hands and knees, and one of the poles fell on her back. When the poles were moved and someone picked her up, her body could not straighten out. Two men pulled her shoulders and legs to straighten out her appearance. The crowd panicked and she was heard screaming. The witness said it was "the most horrible accident I ever witnessed ... and I have seen a good many accidents in my day."&lt;ref name=mackaymercury/&gt; She had broken her back. Local medical professionals provided short-term treatment before she was taken to facilities in New York.&lt;ref name=philadelphiainquirer14may1905/&gt; The accident effectively retired her from her circus career, and she spent several months in a suspended full body cast.&lt;ref name=gizmodo/&gt;&lt;ref name=memorypalace/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Later life==
At some point Rossa and her husband moved back to England, living in a house in [[Upper Norwood]].&lt;ref name=clipper15july1916/&gt; He died in 1915 and requested that his ashes be spread to the "four winds" on the boat ride between the UK and US. British laws did not allow it, but she fulfilled his request secretly the following year, and then returned to England.&lt;ref name=clipper15july1916/&gt;&lt;ref name=watt/&gt; In an update in a 1933 issue of ''[[Bystander (magazine)|The Bystander]]'', she said that she was living on her own in [[Southern England]], enjoying playing [[roulette]] when she had the opportunity.&lt;ref name=bystander/&gt; She died on 8 December 1937 at Camberwell House hospital in [[Peckham]].&lt;ref name=ward/&gt;&lt;ref name=mirror/&gt;

{{quote box|width=33%|quote=[Richter] and all the Female [[Charles Blondin|Blondins]] and the flying trapeze artistes laid the foundations for female performers in the circus. At the end of the eighteenth century, women had first taken part in the circus as equestriennes or as dancers and singers. No longer would they be limited to such acts or as mere decoration; now they could contend equally in dangerous and daring acts, performing as well as any man. Just as the rights for women grew throughout the century, so too did the involvement of women in circus.|source=Steve Ward, ''Sawdust Sisterhood: How Circus Empowered Women'' (2017)}}

[[File:LONDON ILLUSTR(1879) p8.073 ZAZEL.jpg|thumb|Richter in 1879, depicted in a London travel guide]]
Press coverage of Richter's performances remarked on the impressive spectacle of the act and her fearlessness and athleticism. ''The West Australian'' wrote that "there was never a more fearless woman gymnast" and said that "fear was to her an unknown quantity".&lt;ref name=westaustralian/&gt; That she also jumped out of buildings to demonstrate the functionality of a safety net further established that she was brave even outside of the confines of a circus tent. The ''Clipper'' said that "personally Zazel is bright, intelligent and noted for her acts of charity."&lt;ref name=clipper12may1888/&gt;

Though young, Richter was sexualised in advertising materials from the time of her earliest Zazel performances. Whereas ''The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News'' explained that women may appreciate her athleticism, it also provided several descriptions of her "most perfect" figure.&lt;ref name=taitbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=illustrated/&gt; Brian Tyson speculated that, looking at the advertising materials, some of the act's appeal may have been because "in order to fit into the cannon, she had to shed most of her Victorian clothing."&lt;ref name=tyson/&gt; The painter [[George Frederic Watts]] asserted both that she was "the bravest woman I ever saw" and that her "form [was] the most perfect he ever saw."&lt;ref name=philadelphiainquirer14may1905/&gt;&lt;ref name=clipper6october1877/&gt; When Watts asked her to sit for a portrait, her sister came along as a chaperone.&lt;ref name=bystander/&gt; She told ''The Bystander'' that at some point she asked her manager, likely Farini, whether she should donate Watts' portrait to the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]. "He just laughed and said 'whatever would they want in the National Gallery with a picture of ''you''!'" (emphasis in the original).&lt;ref name=bystander/&gt; {{as of|2018}} the Gallery has three portraits of her in its collections: two lithographs by [[Alfred Concanen]] and another by an unknown artist.&lt;ref name=npg/&gt;

According to historians Janet Davis and Peta Tait, circus performers like Richter challenged stereotypes of femininity through acts that demonstrated unabashed feats of strength and agility.&lt;ref name=taitbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=davisbook/&gt; Some began to think she was actually a man dressed like a woman.&lt;ref name=taitbook/&gt; Tait argued that the cannon spectacle, typically at the end of a show, served not only to provide a powerful conclusion but also to balance her other acts' more physical displays of athleticism with a more feminised, relatively passive helplessness &amp;mdash; "a beautiful lady shot from a monstrous cannon."&lt;ref name=taitbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=fitzgerald/&gt; Shane Peacock's description of the show also highlights this dynamic: "Farini stood at the cannon, looking evil in his black beard, commanding the sweet, beautiful young Zazel to enter the mortar, and lighting the fuse to a great flourish, sending her across the [Aquarium's] great hall into a net of his own invention."&lt;ref name=peacockchapter/&gt; A commentator wrote extensively about her talents, appearance, and personality, saying that "her nature was as pure and sunshiny as her face and form were beautiful."&lt;ref name=philadelphiainquirer14may1905/&gt; Elaborating on her "purity," it went on to say that "princes sought her favor, but Zazel remained the pure girl and woman that she is today. Her purity was recognised by [[Queen Victoria]]."&lt;ref name=philadelphiainquirer14may1905/&gt; Circus promoters highlighted their female stars' domesticity so as not to be seen as too revolutionary in terms of women's equality. Interviewers asked Richter about circus life, and her marriage to Starr facilitated discussion of the wholesome, quasi-traditional lives of the performers. She told one interviewer, speaking for women in the circus in general, that "the domestic instinct is very strong among circus women, for the reason that they are deprived of home life a great part of every year. She finds an outlet in many little ways, one of which is an appeal to the chef in charge of the dining car to be allowed to bake a cake."&lt;ref name=davisbook/&gt; Combining statements about female performers' strength with flattering descriptions of their beauty and figure may have served a similar balancing function.&lt;ref name=taitbook/&gt;

Richter's cannon act inspired a scene in the [[Henry James Byron]] [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]], ''Little Doctor Faust'', when it played at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]]. [[Nellie Farren]]'s titular character would climb into a cannon, escaping through a hidden trap door in the stage while her costar, [[Edward O'Connor Terry]], used a [[ramrod]] to simulate preparing the cannon to fire. After an explosion, she would run back in from the other side of the stage. This act, too, met with an accident when the trap door failed to open. When her costar began to use the ramrod, he realised he was hitting her rather than the cannon interior. Improvising, Terry asked "Are you in? Are you far in? Are you nearly far in?", a pun based on her name, "Nellie Farren." The scene as well as Terry's ad lib received such a strong response that they were retained in future performances.&lt;ref name=gsarchive/&gt;&lt;ref name=gaiety/&gt;&lt;ref name=sketches/&gt;

''[[Young Man's Fancy (film)|Young Man's Fancy]]'', a 1939 British [[comedy film]] written and directed by [[Robert Stevenson (director)|Robert Stevenson]] and co-written by [[Roland Pertwee]], featured a character based on Richter. [[Anna Lee]] played the role, Ada, an Irish human cannonball.&lt;ref name=womensweekly/&gt;&lt;ref name=filmworld/&gt;

'''Samaritans'''  is a registered [[charitable organisation|charity]] aimed at providing emotional support to anyone in [[Stress (medicine)|emotional distress]], struggling to cope, or at risk of [[suicide]] throughout the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], often through their [[crisis hotline|telephone helpline]]. Although Samaritans is a secular organisation, the name is derived from the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samaritans.org/ |title=If Christmas starts to hurt, we’ll be here |publisher=Samaritans |date= |accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Its international network exists under the name [[Befrienders Worldwide]], which is part of the [[Volunteer Emotional Support Helplines]] (VESH) with [[Lifeline (counselling service)|Lifeline]] International and the International Federation of Telephone Emergency Services (IFOTES).

==History==
[[File:Samaritans Coventry 6f08.JPG|right|thumb|The [[Coventry]] branch of Samaritans.]]
Samaritans was founded in 1953 by [[Chad Varah]], a [[vicar]] in the Church of England Diocese of London. His inspiration came from an experience he had had some years earlier as a young curate in the [[Diocese of Lincoln]]. He had taken a funeral for a girl of fourteen who had killed herself because she feared she had contracted an [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]]. In reality, she was [[menstruating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burleigh|first=James|title=Rev. Chad Varah, Anglican Priest Who Helped the Suicidal, Dies at 95|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=10 November 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/world/europe/10varah.html|accessdate =27 June 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Varah placed an advertisement in a newspaper encouraging people to volunteer at his church, listening to people contemplating suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

  | accessdate =27 June 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

The movement grew rapidly: within ten years there were 40 branches and now there are 201 branches across the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and Ireland helping many, deliberately organised without regard to national boundaries on the basis that a service which is not political or religious should not recognise sectarian or political divisions.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samaritans offers support through over 21,200 trained volunteers (2015) and is entirely dependent on voluntary support. The name was not originally chosen by Chad Varah: it was part of a headline to an article in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' newspaper on 7 December 1953 about Varah's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samaritans.org/images/sams-mirrorarticle.gif|title=Samaritans.org|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801074214/http://www.samaritans.org/images/sams-mirrorarticle.gif|archivedate=1 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Samaritans announced that volunteer numbers had reached a thirty-year low, and launched a campaign to recruit more young people (specifically targeted at ages 18–24) to become volunteers. The campaign was fronted by [[Phil Selway]], drummer with the band [[Radiohead]], himself a Samaritans volunteer.

===Chad Varah breaks with Samaritans===
In 2004, Varah announced that he had become disillusioned with Samaritans. He said, "It's no longer what I founded. I founded an organisation to offer help to suicidal or equally desperate people. The last elected chairman re-branded the organisation. It was no longer to be an emergency service, it was to be emotional support".&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony J. Jordan]] "The Good Samaritans, Memoir of a Biographer". pp.7-20. Westport Books {{ISBN|978-0-9524447-5-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One in five calls to Samaritans are from someone with suicidal feelings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samaritans.org/sites/default/files/kcfinder/files/Samaritans%20Impact%20Report%202012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Samaritans' vision is that fewer people will die by suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Services==
The core of Samaritans' work is a [[crisis hotline|telephone helpline]], operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Samaritans was the first 24-hour telephone [[helpline]] to be set up in the UK. In addition, the organisation offers a drop-in service for face-to-face discussion, undertakes outreach at festivals and other outdoor events, trains prisoners as "Listeners" to provide support within prisons, and undertakes research into suicide and emotional health issues.

Since 1994, Samaritans has also offered confidential [[email]] support. Initially operating from one branch, the service is now provided by 198 branches and co-ordinated from the organisation's head office. In 2011, Samaritans received over 206,000 emails, including many from outside the UK, and aims to answer each one within twelve hours.
In 2009, Ofcom introduced the first harmonised European numbers for harmonised services of social value,&lt;ref name="116xxx-guide"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/telecoms/numbering/guidance-tele-no/116-euro-numbers | title=Harmonised European numbers for harmonised services of social value (116XXX numbers) | author=[[Ofcom]] | publisher=Office of Communications | date=27 July 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727000915/http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/telecoms/numbering/guidance-tele-no/116-euro-numbers | archivedate=27 July 2010 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; allocating 116 123 to Samaritans. This number is free to call from mobiles and landlines. From 22 September 2015, Samaritans has promoted 116123 as their main number, replacing the premium rate 0845 number previously advertised.

In 2014, Samaritans received 5,100,000 calls for help &amp;ndash; almost one every six seconds &amp;ndash; by phone, email, text, letter, minicom, Typetalk, face-to-face at a branch, through their work in prisons, and at local and national festivals and other events.&lt;ref name="facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samaritans.org/about_samaritans/facts_and_figures.aspx|title=Suicide: facts and figures|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Samaritans volunteers are given rigorous training, and as such they are non-judgmental, empathic and congruent. By listening and asking open questions, the Samaritans volunteers help people explore their feelings and work out their own way forward.

Samaritans does not denounce suicide, and it is not necessary to be suicidal to contact Samaritans. In 2014, nearly 80% of the people calling Samaritans did not express suicidal feelings.&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt; Samaritans believes that offering people the opportunity to be listened to in confidence, and accepted without prejudice, can alleviate despair and make [[emotional health]] a mainstream issue.

=== Media guidelines ===
In 2013, following extensive consultation with journalists and editors throughout the industry, Samaritans produced a set of guidelines outlining best practice when reporting suicide. Since its publication, the organisation has received many awards in recognition of its work influencing the way in which suicide is reported.

===Samaritans Radar===
{{main|Samaritans Radar}}
On 29 October 2014, Samaritans launched the Samaritans Radar [[Web application|app]], which [[Twitter]] users could activate to analyse tweets posted by people they followed; it sent an email alert to the user if it detected signs of distress in a tweet. However, because Twitter users were not notified that their account was being monitored in this way, concerns were raised that the service could be abused by [[Stalking|stalkers]] and [[Troll (Internet)|internet trolls]], who would instantly be made aware that an intended victim was potentially feeling vulnerable.

Following concerns, the service was suspended on 7 November 2014, nine days after launch. Joe Ferns, policy director for Samaritans, said in a statement: "We have made the decision to suspend the application at this time for further consideration". He added: "We are very aware that the range of information and opinion, which is circulating about Samaritans Radar, has created concern and worry for some people and would like to apologise to anyone who has inadvertently been caused any distress. This was not our intention".&lt;ref name="suspension"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.samaritans.org/news/samaritans-radar-announcement|title=Samaritans Radar announcement|publisher=Samaritans|date=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lee |first=Dave |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29962199|title= Samaritans pulls 'suicide watch' Radar app|date=7 November 2014 |website=BBC News | accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The app was later withdrawn completely.&lt;ref name="radarclosure"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help-you/supporting-someone-online/samaritans-radar-update|title=Samaritans Radar update|publisher=Samaritans|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confidentiality==
Samaritans have a strict code of caller confidentiality, even after the death of a caller. Unless the caller gives consent to pass on information, confidentiality will be broken only in rare circumstances, such as when Samaritans receives bomb or terrorism warnings, to call an ambulance because a caller appears to be incapable of making rational decisions for him or herself, or when the caller is threatening volunteers or deliberately preventing the service being delivered to other callers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samaritans.org/about_samaritans/frequent_questions/confidential.aspx|title=Confidentiality|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the Board of Trustees UK agreed a motion breaking with confidentiality in the Republic of Ireland by agreeing, “To provide confidential support to children but report to the Health Service Executive any contacts (from either adults or children) where it appears a child is experiencing specific situations such as those that can cause them serious harm from themselves or others.”
In 2011, Facebook collaborated with Samaritans to offer help to people in distress. This led to 'cold case' calling, which some believed was an infringement on people's privacy. An Irish journalist wrote of her experience of receiving such a communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Brien|first=Ciara|title=The day Facebook asked me: ‘are you in crisis?’|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=30 May 2013|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/the-day-facebook-asked-me-are-you-in-crisis-1.1411396|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reach==
Through its email service, Samaritans' work has extended well beyond the UK and Ireland, as messages are received from all around the world.

Samaritans' international reach is through [[Befrienders Worldwide]], an organisation of over 400 centres in 38 countries offering similar activities. Samaritans took on and renamed the Befrienders International network in 2003, a year after it collapsed. Some members of Befrienders Worldwide also use the name Samaritans; this includes centres in the United States, India, [[Hong Kong]], [[Serbia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], among others.

The [[Volunteer Emotional Support Helplines]] (VESH) combines Samaritans (through Befrienders Worldwide) with the other two largest international services (IFOTES &amp; [[Lifeline (counselling service)|Lifeline]]), and plans a combined international network of helplines. In their roles as emotional support service networks, they have all agreed to develop a more effective and robust international interface.

==Similar charities==

A number of other helplines exist that offer a similar service to Samaritans. These are often aimed at a specific sector/group of people.

One example is [[Nightline (student service)|Nightline]] — student-run listening and information services, based at universities across the country, offer a night time support service for students. Each service is run specifically for students at a particular university/geographical area, and most Nightlines are members of the Nightline Association, a registered charity in England and Wales.

The [[NSPCC]]'s ChildLine service is similar to Samaritans in some ways. NSPCC (National Service of Prevention of Cruelty to Children) offers support for children only, but Samaritans supports both children and adults alike. The NSPCC does not usually support adults.

Another example is [[Aware (voluntary organisation)|Aware]] — a national voluntary organisation, based in Ireland, which provides supports to individuals who experience [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] with their families and friends. It provides a Helpline service, as well as nationwide Support Groups and monthly lectures, which seek to educate and increase awareness of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aware.ie/|title=Depression Support - Depression Help Ireland - Aware|website=www.aware.ie|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[drama]], a '''scene'''  is a unit of action, often a subdivision of an [[Act (drama)|act]]. 

==French scene==
A "French scene" is a scene in which the beginning and end are marked by a change in the presence of characters onstage, rather than by the lights going up or down or the set being changed.&lt;ref name="George"&gt;George, Kathleen (1994) ''Playwriting: The First Workshop'', Focal Press, {{ISBN|978-0-240-80190-2}}, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obligatory scene==
From the French ''scène à faire'', an obligatory scene is a scene (usually highly charged with emotion) which is anticipated by the audience and provided by an obliging playwright. An example is ''[[Hamlet]]'' 3.4, when Hamlet confronts his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J. A.|authorlink=J. A. Cuddon|editor=C. E.

[[File:The Canadian Short Screenplay Competition Logo.jpg|thumb|right]]The '''Canadian Short Screenplay Competition (CSSC)''' is an annual script [[writing]] [[competition|contest]], established in 2008, that seeks to celebrate excellence in [[short film]] [[screenwriting]].

==History==
The CSSC, founded in 2008 by producer David Cormican, is administered by Year of the Skunk Productions. The competition's partners in 2008 included [[Playback Magazine]], Meridian Artists, InkTip.com, The Spoke Club and [[Withoutabox]].

In August 2009, the competition started the now popular '''#WW''' (Writer(s) Wednesday) [[hashtag]] on social networking site [[Twitter.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenplay-contest.com/ww/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120911185758/http://www.screenplay-contest.com/ww/ |archivedate=2012-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the competition partnered with the [[Yorkton Film Festival]], allowing the CSSC to announce the winner of the competition as part of the Golden Sheaf Awards gala. The first winner announced in this fashion on May 29, 2010 in Yorkton, SK, was British writer Neil Graham. Mr. Graham (and his winning script "Something Pointless"), was the very first recipient of the Writers Block Crystal, introduced to the competition in 2010 as a take-away award for the winning screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldensheafawards.com/default.aspx?page=29 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524204349/http://www.goldensheafawards.com/default.aspx?page=29 |archivedate=2010-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, the CSSC announced two-time competition finalist Carolynne Ciceri, as the inaugural #WW Writers Wednesday Laureate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wireservice.ca/index.php?module=News&amp;func=display&amp;sid=2690&lt;/ref&gt; Ms. Ciceri's duties as #WW Laureate consist of a year-long position posting a weekly blog communication on the subjects of writing, filmmaking and short films.

On January 1, 2011, the CSSC's '''THE Blog''' was announced as a winner of the ''2010 Canadian Weblog Awards'' in the category of 'Writing and Literature'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ninjamatics.com/canadian-weblog-awards/2010/12/31/winners-of-the-ninjamatics-2010-canadian-weblog-awards.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==#WW Writers Wednesday&lt;ref&gt;http://www.novelpublicity.com/2011/03/top-10-hashtags-for-writers-on-twitter-plus-a-translation-guide/#respond&lt;/ref&gt;==

The CSSC maintains that they conceptualized and posted the very first weekly [[hashtag]] '''#WW''' (popularly used and known amongst writing circles as Writer(s) Wednesday)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.novelpublicity.com/2011/03/top-10-hashtags-for-writers-on-twitter-plus-a-translation-guide/#respond&lt;/ref&gt; on popular social media networking site [[Twitter.com]]. Writers and users of the site may nominate writers on Twitter that others using the social networking site should follow by using the''' #WW''' hashtag (similar to [[#ff]] or [[#followfriday]]) within a tweet on the site.

The original '''#WW''' Writers Wednesday [[Twitter|tweet]] was made using [[TweetDeck]] on August 5, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenplay-contest.com/ww/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120911185758/http://www.screenplay-contest.com/ww/ |archivedate=2012-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Sam Loyd Company''' is an organization based in the [[United States]] that specializes in [[puzzle games]]. The company was launched in 2005 after the work of [[Samuel Loyd]] and his son in the 1800 and 1900’s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Golombek]], ''Golombek's Encyclopedia of Chess'', 1977, {{ISBN|0-517-53146-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced puzzles for a number of resources including the New York Saturday Courier, Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Women’s Home Companion and created puzzle cards for advertising purposes. It was 2005 before the company was founded to republish and protect Loyd’s original work.

==Company Foundation==

Between the years of 1855 and 1910, Sam Loyd produced a number of puzzles and chess problems for a variety of [[newspapers]] and [[magazines]]. These included the New York Courier and Our Puzzle Magazine. The White Horse Monument was his most successful puzzle, which was based on the White Horse Monument in [[Berkshire]], [[United Kingdom|UK]].

Other puzzles created by Sam Loyd still used today include, ‘Trick Donkey’s Puzzle’, ‘Get Off the Earth’ and ‘Puzzle of Teddy and the Lion’. The puzzles he created went on to be known as some of the best of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| publisher = Courier Dover Publications | isbn = 978-0-486-29225-0 | last = Costello | first = Matthew J. | title = The Greatest Puzzles of All Time | date = 1996-09-16 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpUCdrMdKN4C&amp;pg=PA45 45] (Sam Loyd and the Vanishing Puzzle)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death in 1911, his son Walther continued his work.

Walther Loyd began by creating a puzzle book for children, something the company would later focus on. He also created the book ‘Sam Loyd’s Cyclopedia of 500 Puzzles, Tricks and Conundrums. All the work created by Sam Loyd and his son is managed and protected by the Sam Loyd Company.

71 years after the passing of Sam Loyd Jnr. work began on republishing the original ‘Get Off the Earth’ Puzzle. A website containing the puzzle was also launched. In 2004, “Get Off the Earth Puzzle' is republished as a commemorative edition, 110 years after Sam Loyd had received his original patent for the puzzle.

In 2005 The Sam Loyd Company was founded. In the same year both Trick Donkey’s and The Pony Puzzles are republished.

==Company Works==
The Sam Loyd Company recreated a number of puzzles including [[figurines]], republished puzzles and advertising cards.  The only figurine they have produced was of the Warrior action figure, taken from the ‘Get Off the Earth’ puzzle. This figurine was a limited edition and only 500 were produced.

The company also owns the rights to a number of silent movies that were created in 1917 after the success of the puzzles. These videos have close links with Thomas Edison, who helped bring the work to life. The idea was to create educational films that could be shown in classrooms. The videos included the railroad mix up, quarrelsome neighbors and the puzzling board.&lt;ref name="The Sam Loyd Company"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.samloyd.com/about-us.html| title=About the Sam Loyd Company| publisher=The Sam Loyd Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
The Sam Loyd Company has close links to education. The puzzles are aimed at making algebraic and geographical problems more interesting. The idea is that people can puzzle over them without realizing they are learning at the same time. The influences came from Samuel Loyd who was quoted saying, “We see how the average boy, who abhors square root or algebra, will find delight in working out puzzles which involve identically the same principles.

{{Culture of Poland}}

In common with other [[Europe]]an countries, the most frequent and most popular form of '''[[theatre]] in [[Poland]]''' is [[Drama|dramatic theatre]], based on the existence of relatively stable [[Stagecraft|artistic companies]]. It is above all a theatre of [[Theatre director|directors]], who decide on the form of its productions and the appearance of individual scenes. There is no strict division in Poland between theatre and film directors and [[actor]]s, therefore many stage artists are known to theatre goers from films of [[Andrzej Wajda]], for example: [[Wojciech Pszoniak]], [[Daniel Olbrychski]], [[Krystyna Janda]], [[Jerzy Radziwiłowicz]], and from films of [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]], actors such as [[Jerzy Stuhr]], [[Janusz Gajos]] and others.

Alongside the many types of dramatic theatre whose basis is [[literature]], there are in Poland historic forms of theatre in which spoken word is not the most important means of expression, e.g., visual theatre popular against state [[censorship]], musical theatre, theatre of movement, etc. An equal popularity is being gained by theatres employing puppets, figures, or shadows; there is even a theatre of drawing as well as a theatre of fire.

== Tradition ==
[[File:Wojciech Bogusławski.PNG|thumb|180px|[[Wojciech Bogusławski]] (1757-1829) is regarded as the "Father of Polish theatre"]]
The strength of [[Poland|Polish]] dramatic [[theatre]] lies in the professionalism of its actors. The tradition of the great 19th century players, with [[Helena Modrzejewska]] – the "star of two continents" – at its forefront, has been continued by successive generations of university trained artists. This variety and authentic commitment by so many people provides the best evidence that theatre was and still is an inspirational experience in Poland. Further proof may be seen in the degree of audience interest toward the new, experimental theatre, creating a unique [[Mood (psychology)|ambiance]] around them. It may also be seen in the expansion of [[Theatre festival|festival life]] and respected theatre magazines, e.g., "Dialog", which has, for decades, presented the latest achievements in world dramaturgy. Alongside the established institutions with seasoned professionals and centuries-old traditions, there are amateur theatres and travelling groups as well.

Among the professional companies, the most representative is [[National Theatre, Warsaw|the National Theatre]] in [[Warsaw]]. The core of its repertoire consists of the most cherished Polish and foreign dramas, with which directors conduct their individual dialogues, asking these classic pieces questions tormenting modern-day Poles. Within this exploration, the National Theatre frequently attempts very courageous experiments, which means that its stage, although a showcase, is not at all academic. Most characteristic are the productions of [[Jerzy Grzegorzewski]] (Theatre director between 1997–2002), who, employing complicated stage equipment (metaphoric scenographic elements such as pantographs, huge musical instruments, or symbolic props) and creating his own montage of classic texts, testing their value, searching for their relevance to the here and now.

Somewhat more conservative is the second Polish theatre with national status - the National Old Theatre in [[Kraków]], the only one in Poland belonging to the Union of European Theatres. This theatre, which shone in the seventies thanks to the well-regarded and world-famous productions of [[Konrad Swinarski]], [[Jerzy Jarocki]], and Andrzej Wajda, is attempting to continue these traditions, seeking worthy successors to these masters. The Old Theatre's most important current collaborator is [[Krystian Lupa]]. For years, he has been consistently producing the dramas and prose of German language writers (T. Bernhardt, R.M. Rilke, R. Musil), not even hesitating before transferring Broch's novel "The Sleepwalkers" to the stage. Russian literature also lies within his sphere of interest (productions of Dostoyevsky's "The Brothers Karamazov" and, recently, M. Bulgakov's "The Master and Margarita"). Lupa shatters the traditional action of the performances, stretching their tempos and concentrating on the poetic values of particular situations rather than the plot or conflict. This is a theatre of philosophical and existential reflection in whose centre is situated the modern human being, attempting to find a place in an ever more dehumanised world. For several seasons now, Lupa's productions have been regularly shown in Paris, where they have been received with great admiration by critics and audiences. Lupa is also one of the most important teachers of directing at the [[Ludwik Solski Academy for the Dramatic Arts]] in Kraków, where his students have included the newest generation of Polish directors: [[Krzysztof Warlikowski]], Grzegorz Jarzyna, Maja Kleczewska, Anna Augustynowicz, [[Michal Zadara]] and Jan Klata.

== Actors and directors ==
[[File:Kantor09.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Tadeusz Kantor]] (1915-1990) is renowned for his revolutionary theatrical performances in Poland and abroad.]]
At present, the Polish theatre actor possibly best-known outside the country is [[Andrzej Seweryn]], who in the years 1984–1988 was a member of the international group formed by [[Peter Brook]] to work on the staging of the [[Mahabharata]], and since 1993 has been linked with the [[Comédie Française]]. The most revered actor of the second half of the twentieth century in Poland is generally considered to be [[Tadeusz Łomnicki]], who died in 1992 of a heart attack while rehearsing ''King Lear''.

During the second half of the nineties, there appeared in Polish dramatic theatre a new generation of young directors, who have attempted to create productions relevant to the experience and problems of a thirty-something generation brought up surrounded by mass culture, habituated to a fast-moving lifestyle, but at the same time ever more lost in the world of [[consumer capitalism]]. The leading theatre in this movement is Warsaw's TR, known as "the fastest theatre in town". Among its collaborating directors, [[Krzysztof Warlikowski]] and [[Grzegorz Jarzyna]] stand out. Warlikowski has gained international recognition with a series of innovative productions of Shakespeare, performed both at Polish theatres (''The Taming of the Shrew'', ''Hamlet'') and abroad (''Pericles'' at the [[Piccolo Teatro (Milan)|Piccolo Teatro]] in Milan, ''Twelfth Night'' and ''The Tempest'' at the Stadt-Theater in Stuttgart). Looking for a way to present the complex existential situation of contemporary humanity, Jarzyna reaches both for contemporary drama ([[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz|Witkiewicz]]'s ''Tropical Madness'', [[Witold Gombrowicz|Gombrowicz]]'s ''Princess Ivona'', or Frazer's ''Unidentified Human Remains...'') and classic European novels (Dostoyevsky's ''The Idiot'', Mann's ''Doktor Faustus'', directed at the Hebbel Theater in Berlin). Recently, both directors have taken an interest in the work of Sarah Kane, mounting startling productions: ''Cleansed'' (Warlikowski) and ''4.48 Psychosis'' (Jarzyna).

The true rebirth, following the collapse of the [[Soviet empire]], was experienced by the [[Ludowy Theatre]] in [[Nowa Huta]] district of Kraków taken over by an actor, director, and politician [[Jerzy Fedorowicz]] (1989–2005).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krakow.pl/en/kultura/nagrody/?id=kis1994.html  Jerzy Fedorowicz, biography] at ''Magiczny Krakow''&lt;/ref&gt; Under his management, the theatre won considerable recognition, and numerous awards.  It was twice invited to the [[Edinburgh International Festival]]: in 1996 with Macbeth directed by [[Jerzy Stuhr]], and in 1997 with [[Antigona]] directed by Włodzimierz Nurkowski. Current director is Jacek Strama, an award-winning theatre and film producer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ludowy.pl/index.php?action=aboutDirectors  Jacek Strama, short biography] at Teatr Ludowy official website, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Venues ==
[[File:Teatr Miejski im. Juliusza Słowackiego; A-36; PL-MA, Kraków, pl. św. Ducha 1.jpg|thumb|280px|The [[Juliusz Słowacki Theatre]] in [[Kraków]] is one of Poland's premier theatre venues.]]
The theatrical map of Poland, on which for many years the most important points were Warsaw and Kraków, has undergone numerous changes over the last decade. The most recognized directors in Poland, such as Krzysztof Warlikowski, Grzegorz Jarzyna, Jan Klata, [[Michal Zadara]] or Maja Kleczewska work in Warsaw, but also travel to other cities.  While it is true to say that the capital's position is safe, there is strong competition for second place between Kraków and [[Wrocław]]. Recognised masters (Jerzy Jarocki, Krystian Lupa) and a group of younger directors, with [[Piotr Cieplak]] and [[Paweł Miśkiewicz]] at the head, collaborate with Wrocław's theatres. [[Poznań]], [[Gdańsk]], and [[Łódź]] have similar ambitions. One of the more unanticipated surprises of recent seasons has been the blossoming of theatre in [[Legnica]], a town which, until recent times, was the main Soviet military base in Poland, where the Artistic Director, [[Jacek Głomb]], has been actively searching for new ways to reach the town's inhabitants. So he began putting on shows relating events in the lives of the local citizens, as well as siting classical dramas in surprising arenas (e.g., Shakespeare's ''Coriolanus'' in an old Prussian barracks).  Since Pawel Lysak became the Artistic Director of the theatre in Bydgoszcz, this city in central Poland has been able to enjoy top-level theatre as well.

There is no doubt that the greatest achievements of the 20th-century Polish theatre are thanks to those artists seeking new forms and functions for the theatrical arts. From the very beginning of the great European reform movement, Polish theatre people have undertaken courageous experiments in this area. The Polish stream of reform was characterised by the linking of theatre with metaphysics. The source of this type of search was the work and thinking of the Polish [[Romantism|Romantics]], with [[Adam Mickiewicz]] at the forefront. In his ''Forefathers' Eve'', the most important work in [[Polish literature]], there is a vision of theatre as phenomenon on the border between a show and a ceremony led by an actor. In succeeding years, the most important artists of the Polish stage referred to, and sometimes polemicized with, this vision, developing or modifying it.
[[File:Warszawa, ul. Senatorska 21, 25 20170516 001.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Grand Theatre, Warsaw|The Grand Theatre]] in [[Warsaw]] is among the largest theatres in Europe with a seating capacity of over 2000.]]

It was from this root that [[Stanisław Wyspiański]]'s art arose. Poet, painter, visionary, working at the beginning of the twentieth century he influenced the development of theatre over the course of the following century. His works, born of Romantic and symbolic inspiration, conjoining Catholic, pagan, and classic traditions with the existential and political problems of the new century, has not been completely discovered and understood to this day, forming a vivid and fascinating heritage. It was to this tradition that the originators of Polish monumental theatre, [[Leon Schiller]] (Edward Gordon Craig's collaborator), [[Juliusz Osterwa]], and [[Wilam Horzyca]], harked back. [[Tadeusz Kantor]], the avant-garde visual artist who became interested in theatre while trying to find new forms of expression, also alluded to it in his theatrical searches. After years of investigation (attempts to adapt the rules of Tachism and performance art to the needs of the theatre), Kantor created his own model, called the Theatre of Death. In his most famous productions - ''The Dead Class'', ''Wielopole, Wielopole'' or ''I Shall Never Return'' - the artist presented a kind of spiritualist séance, calling pictures, words and sounds deformed by the passing of time. Referring to his memories and experiences, he portrayed a collective memory of the end of the tragic twentieth century - the century of the [[Holocaust]].

== Jerzy Grotowski ==
Though arising from the same roots, a totally different attempt to renew theatre was undertaken by [[Jerzy Grotowski]]. Aiming for the creation of a performance as a selfless act of sacrifice, he carried out the second great reform, after Konstantin Stanisłavski's, of the actor's art, and his book ''Towards a Poor Theatre'' is still one of the most important textbooks in drama schools the world over. The productions put on by Grotowski's Theatre Laboratory, such as ''Acropolis'' (Wyspiański's drama, re-set in a concentration camp), ''The Constant Prince'' (after Calderon-Słowacki) or ''Apocalypsis cum figuris'', are among twentieth-century world theatre's most important achievements, still points of reference for many artists. Among others, [[Peter Brook]], [[Eugenio Barba]], [[Marketa Kimbrell]], [[Richard Schechner]] and [[Andre Gregory]] have derived inspiration from Grotowski's work. Over the last decade of his life, Grotowski had been investigating the possibility of creating a dramatic structure whose effect would be similar to that of a religious ceremony. After his death (1999), the work was continued by his students, [[Thomas Richards (director)|Thomas Richards]] and [[Mario Biagini]], leading the Workcenter, founded by Grotowski in Pontedera in Italy.

Grotowski's work has also influenced many Polish theatre artistes. [[Włodzimierz Staniewski]], who, after some years of close collaboration with Grotowski, finally rebelled, founded the "Gardzienice" Centre for Theatrical Practice in 1977 in a small village near [[Lublin]]. Today, 25 years later, this centre is world-famous and Staniewski's method of acting, known as "theatre ecology," has been numbered among the most important of the twentieth century. The most characteristic aspect of "Gardzienice" is its treatment of theatre as one of many various cultural activities, including expeditions to areas inhabited by people holding onto folk traditions (e.g., the Eastern parts of Poland, [[Lemko]] villages or the Ukrainian Hucul region), and a strong link between art and the environment from which it arises. The productions themselves, unusually intense and filled with music, movement and dramatic singing - recall the fundamental myths of East and West.
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Teatr3.jpg|300px|right|thumb]] --&gt;
For several years, Staniewski has been particularly interested in [[Ancient Greece]] as a source of [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] and spirituality. After Apuleius' ''Metamorphoses'' (performed in [[Germany]], the United States, the United Kingdom and Spain, among other countries) he brought into being, with "Gardzienice", a production of Eurypides' ''Elektra'', blazing new trails in his theatrical search. From the ranks of Włodzimierz Staniewski's group have come the founders of many active and uncommonly interesting centres, and not just connected with theatre.

In [[Sejny]], there is the [[Borderland Foundation]], created by [[Krzysztof Czyżewski]], a one-time Gardzienice collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;http://pogranicze.sejny.pl/archiwum/english/found/found.htm&lt;/ref&gt; One of "Borderland's" forms of work is theatre (e.g., a production of Szymon Anski's ''Dybbuk''), and its aim is to raise the consciousness of the inhabitants of the borderlands regarding the unique richness of their cultural tradition, which has for centuries linked Polish, [[Jew]]ish, [[Belarusians|Belarusian]], [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]], [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], and even [[Tatars|Tatar]] influences. In common with Czyżewski, the founder of the "Music of the Eastern Lands" Foundation, Jan Bernad, also came from Gardzienice, and has devoted himself to gathering and reconstructing the rich multiethnic traditions of the ancient music from the Eastern Borders for years.

During the Sixties and Seventies, at the same time as Grotowski's work, the movement of social and politically engaged theatre was also developing in Poland. At first, it was, above all, a rebellious student theatre, later, during the period of martial law, the movement also accepted professionals, who organised productions for the underground Home Theatre. One specific form of political rebellion through theatre was promoted by Wrocław's [[Orange Alternative]], an informal group which organised mass events poking fun at the symbols and ceremonies of officialdom. After the regaining of sovereignty in 1989, this movement weakened, but recently it has been reborn as an anticapitalist and antiwar movement. The most important centre for this kind of activity is Poznań, where, alongside the once famous and still active Theatre of the Eighth Day (the antiglobalist production ''Summit''), the [[Teatr Biuro Podróży|Travel Agency Theatre]] operates. One of its most important achievements is the open-air production ''Carmen Funebre'', created under the influence of events in the former Yugoslavia and shown all over the world.

Another developing stream of theatre in Poland is so-called visual theatre, using pictures above all, and almost completely avoiding the spoken word. Its originator is considered to be [[Józef Szajna]] (1922), an artist whose collaboration with theatre began with stage design, went on to direction, and, since the seventies, the creation of theatrical productions employing striking pictures referring to expressionist and surrealist aesthetics. The unique form of Szajna's theatre arose both from his artistic and personal experiences (during [[World War II|WWII]] he was a concentration camp prisoner). They were based on a vision of a deformed world in which battles are fought over the basic human values, which are constantly under threat. Szajna's most famous productions, also performed abroad, are ''Dante'', ''Cervantes'', and ''Replica'', which directly relate to his traumatic wartime experiences.

Currently, the leading representative of visual theatre is [[Leszek Madzik|Leszek Mądzik]], the founder of the Visual Stage at the [[Catholic University of Lublin]]. He has, for many years, put on productions that are a kind of theatrical meditation, touching on existential and religious topics.

Close to this stream are the strongly theatrical happenings of [[Jerzy Kalina]] as well as the theatrical activities of Warsaw's Academy of Movement. Speaking of the borderline between art and theatre, it is also worth recalling that there are still active performance artists in Poland. Polish experimental theatre has been counted among the most interesting in Europe, evidence of which are regular prestigious Fringe First awards from the Edinburgh Festival. In recent years, for example, the Travel Agency, Wierszalin, Kana, Song of the Goat, and Provisorium theatres have been recognised in this way.

During recent years in Poland, there has been a boom in musical theatre. Alongside the world-famous composers and singers, Polish directors of opera are rated ever more highly. The most important among this group has, for years, been Ryszard Peryt, collaborating with the Warsaw Chamber Opera (organising the annual Mozart Festival, among others) and the National Opera. His speciality is the production of oratorios, among which the theatrical version of Verdi's ''Requiem'', which has been performed in Moscow's Red Square, stands out. Recent seasons have been a period of great operatic success for the film director [[Mariusz Treliński]], who has aroused the interest of New York's Metropolitan Opera. Critical acclaim has also been enjoyed by the opera stage designs of [[Andrzej Majewski]].
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Teatr4.jpg|300px|left|thumb]] --&gt;
Growing popularity is also enjoyed by dance theatre. In addition to classical ballet, whose best groups have for years been linked with opera halls, contemporary dance groups have been appearing since the Sixties and Seventies. Among the most important are Poznań's Polish Theatre of Dance, founded by Conrad Drzewiecki and currently led by Ewa Wycichowska, and Wrocław's "Pantomima", founded by [[Henryk Tomaszewski (mime)|Henryk Tomaszewski]] (1919–2001). Since the nineties, both [[Bytom]] (Silesian Dance Theatre) and Kraków have become important centres, hosting festivals which attract dancers from all over the world.

== Festivals ==
International festivals are a particular element of Polish theatre life, occasions to allow the artistic achievements of East and West to confront each other. To this end, there are such festivals as "Contact," taking place annually in [[Toruń]], and "Dialogue," organised biannually in autumn in Wrocław, in turn with Kraków's "Dedications" (October) and Warsaw's "Meetings" (November). Aside from these, the most interesting events are "Theatrical Confrontations" in [[Lublin]] (October), the open-air "Malta" festival in Poznań (June), Kraków's "Ballet in Spring" and the Puppet Theatre Biennial in [[Bielsko-Biała]].

One world-famous person who had links with 20th-century Polish theatre and was [[Pope John Paul II]]. His interest in theatre dated back to his secondary school years in [[Wadowice]], where the teenage Karol Wojtyła worked in the school theatre. During the Second World War, he co-founded, with his old teacher Mieczysław Kotlarczyk, the [[Underground education in Poland during World War II|underground]] Rhapsodic Theatre, a group cultivating the Romantic tradition of live poetry. After the war, as a priest, he supported the group and was also its critic, publishing reviews of its performances. Within his literary work, John Paul II also has written a number of dramas, the best-known of which are ''Our God's Brother'' and ''The Jeweller's Shop''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53588">The '''Theatre of the Absurd''' ({{lang-fr|théâtre de l'absurde}} {{IPA-fr|teɑtʁ(ə) də lapsyʁd|}}) is a post–World War II designation for particular [[Play (theatre)|plays]] of [[absurdist fiction]] written by a number of primarily European [[playwright]]s in the late 1950s, as well as one for the style of theatre which has evolved from their work. Their work focused largely on the idea of [[existentialism]] and expressed what happens when human existence has no meaning or purpose and therefore all communication breaks down.  Logical construction and argument gives way to irrational and illogical speech and to its ultimate conclusion, silence.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hutchinson Encyclopedia'', Millennium Edition, Helicon 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Critic [[Martin Esslin]] coined the term in his 1960 essay "Theatre of the Absurd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Theatre of the Absurd |first=Martin |last=Esslin |year=1961 |oclc=329986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He related these plays based on a broad theme of the Absurd, similar to the way [[Albert Camus]] uses the term in his 1942 essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |title=THE THEATRE OF THE ABSURD: THE WEST AND THE EAST |first=Jan |last=Culík |date=2000 |publisher=University of Glasgow |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823075755/http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |archivedate=2009-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Absurd in these plays takes the form of man's reaction to a world apparently without meaning, or man as a puppet controlled or menaced by invisible outside forces. This style of writing was first popularized by the Samuel Beckett play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' (1953). Although the term is applied to a wide range of plays, some characteristics coincide in many of the plays: broad comedy, often similar to [[vaudeville]], mixed with horrific or tragic images; characters caught in hopeless situations forced to do repetitive or meaningless actions; dialogue full of clichés, wordplay, and nonsense; plots that are cyclical or absurdly expansive; either a parody or dismissal of [[Theatrical realism|realism]] and the concept of the "[[well-made play]]". These plays were shaped by the political turmoil, scientific breakthrough, and social upheaval going on in the world around the playwrights during these times.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

While absurdists believed that life is absurd, they also believed that death and the "after life" were equally absurd if not more, and that whether people live or not all of their actions are pointless and everything will lead to the same end (hence the repetitiveness in many of these absurdist plays).{{fact|date=September 2018}}

In his book ''Absurd Drama'' (1965), Esslin wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;... the Theatre of the Absurd attacks the comfortable certainties of religious or political orthodoxy. It aims to shock its audience out of complacency, to bring it face to face with the harsh facts of the human situation as these writers see it. But the challenge behind this message is anything but one of despair. It is a challenge to accept the human condition as it is, in all its mystery and absurdity, and to bear it with dignity, nobly, responsibly; precisely {{em|because}} there are no easy solutions to the mysteries of existence, because ultimately man is alone in a meaningless world. The shedding of easy solutions, of comforting illusions, may be painful, but it leaves behind it a sense of freedom and relief. And that is why, in the last resort, the Theatre of the Absurd does not provoke tears of despair but the laughter of liberation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Playwrights commonly associated with the Theatre of the Absurd include [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Jean Genet]], [[Arthur Adamov]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[Tom Stoppard]], [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], [[Miguel Mihura]], [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], [[Fernando Arrabal]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Edward Albee]], [[Malay Roy Choudhury]], [[Tadeusz Różewicz]], [[Sławomir Mrożek]], [[N.F. Simpson]], and [[Badal Sarkar]].{{fact|date=September 2018}}

== Origin ==
In the first edition of ''The Theatre of the Absurd'', Esslin saw the work of these playwrights as giving artistic meaning to [[Albert Camus]]'s philosophy that life is inherently without meaning, as illustrated in his work ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. In the first (1961) edition, Esslin presented the four defining playwrights of the movement as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Arthur Adamov]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], and [[Jean Genet]], and in subsequent editions he added a fifth playwright, [[Harold Pinter]]—although each of these writers has unique preoccupations and characteristics that go beyond the term "absurd."&lt;ref name=Esslin1961ed&gt;Martin Esslin, ''The Theatre of the Absurd'' (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1961).

== Significant precursors ==
Though the label "Theatre of the Absurd" covers a wide variety of playwrights with differing styles, they do have some common stylistic precursors (Esslin [1961]). These precursors include Elizabethan tragicomedy, formal experimentation, pataphysics, surrealism, Dadaism, and most importantly existentialism.

=== Elizabethan – tragicomedy ===
The mode of most "absurdist" plays is [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref name="Esslin, pg. 323-324"&gt;Esslin, pg. 323–324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Styan. ''Modern Drama in Theory and Practice''. Cambridge University Press, 1983 {{ISBN|0-521-29629-3}}, pg. 125&lt;/ref&gt; As Nell says in ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'', "Nothing is funnier than unhappiness … it's the most comical thing in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett. ''Endgame: a play in one act, followed by Act without words, a mime for one player''. Grove Press, 1958. {{ISBN|0-8021-5024-1}}. pg. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Esslin cites [[William Shakespeare]] as an influence on this aspect of the "Absurd drama."&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 321–323&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare's influence is acknowledged directly in the titles of Ionesco's ''[[Macbett]]'' and Stoppard's ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]''. Friedrich Dürrenmatt says in his essay "Problems of the Theatre", "Comedy alone is suitable for us … But the tragic is still possible even if pure tragedy is not.  We can achieve the tragic out of comedy.  We can bring it forth as a frightening moment, as an abyss that opens suddenly; indeed, many of Shakespeare's tragedies are already really comedies out of which the tragic arises."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Dürrenmatt. "Problems of the Theatre". ''The Marriage of Mr. Mississippi''. Grove Press, 1964. {{ISBN|978-0-394-17198-2}}. pg. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though layered with a significant amount of tragedy, the Theatre of the Absurd echoes other great forms of comedic performance, according to Esslin, from [[Commedia dell'arte]] to [[vaudeville]].&lt;ref name="Esslin, pg. 323-324" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Styan, pg. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Esslin cites early film comedians and [[music hall]] artists such as [[Charlie Chaplin]], the [[Keystone Cops]] and [[Buster Keaton]] as direct influences. (Keaton even starred in Beckett's ''[[Film (film)|Film]]'' in 1965.)&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formal experimentation ===
As an experimental form of theatre, many Theatre of the Absurd playwrights employ techniques borrowed from earlier innovators. Writers and techniques frequently mentioned in relation to the Theatre of the Absurd include the 19th-century nonsense poets, such as [[Lewis Carroll]] or [[Edward Lear]];&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 330–331&lt;/ref&gt; Polish playwright [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]];&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 382–385&lt;/ref&gt; the Russians [[Daniil Kharms]],&lt;ref&gt;Neil Cornwell. ''The absurd in literature.'' Manchester University Press ND, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7190-7410-X}}. pg. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolai Erdman]],&lt;ref&gt;John Freedman. ''The major plays of Nikolai Erdman: The warrant and The suicide''. Routledge, 1995.{{ISBN|3718655837}}. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; and others; [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s [[Distancing effect|distancing]] techniques in his "[[Epic theatre]]";&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 365–368&lt;/ref&gt; and the "dream plays" of [[August Strindberg]].&lt;ref name="Esslin1961ed" /&gt;&lt;ref name = StyanDark&gt;J. L. Styan. ''The dark comedy: the development of modern comic tragedy.'' Cambridge University Press, 1968. {{ISBN|0-521-09529-8}}. pg. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--needs page numbers in citations throughout--&gt;

One commonly cited precursor is [[Luigi Pirandello]], especially ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]''.&lt;ref name = StyanDark /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annette J. Saddik. Ed. "Experimental Innovations After the Second World War". ''Contemporary American Drama''.Edinburgh University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-7486-2494-5}}.pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Pirandello was a highly regarded theatrical experimentalist who wanted to bring down the [[fourth wall]] presupposed by the [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] of playwrights such as [[Henrik Ibsen]].&lt;!--Page number references to citations needed throughout.--&gt; According to [[W. B. Worthen]], ''Six Characters'' and other Pirandello plays use "[[Metatheatre]]—[[roleplaying]], [[Play within a play|plays-within-plays]], and a flexible sense of the limits of stage and illusion—to examine a highly-theatricalized vision of [[Personal identity|identity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Worthen, pg. 702&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influential playwright was [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] whose ''[[The Breasts of Tiresias]]'' was the first work to be called "[[Surrealism|surreal]]".&lt;ref name = Lewis260&gt;Allan Lewis. "The Theatre of the 'Absurd' – Beckett, Ionesco, Genet". ''The Contemporary Theatre: The Significant Playwrights of Our Time''.

Twayne Publishers, 1991. {{ISBN|0-8057-8270-2}}. pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pataphysics, surrealism, and Dadaism ===
One of the most significant common precursors is [[Alfred Jarry]] whose wild, irreverent, and lascivious ''Ubu'' plays scandalized Paris in the 1890s. Likewise, the concept of [['pataphysics]]—"the science of imaginary solutions"—first presented in Jarry's ''Gestes et opinions du docteur Faustroll, pataphysicien'' (''[[Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, pataphysician]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Jill Fell. ''Alfred Jarry, an imagination in revolt''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8386-4007-9}}. pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt; was inspirational to many later Absurdists,&lt;ref name="Glasgow" /&gt; some of whom joined the Collège de 'pataphysique, founded in honor of Jarry in 1948&lt;ref name="Lewis260" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pag. 346–348&lt;/ref&gt; (Ionesco,&lt;ref name = Queneau&gt;Raymond Queneau, Marc Lowenthal. ''Stories &amp; remarks''.U of Nebraska Press, 2000
{{ISBN|0-8032-8852-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-8852-2}}. pg. ix–x&lt;/ref&gt; Arrabal, and Vian&lt;ref name="Queneau" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Bellos. ''Georges Perec: a life in words : a biography''. David R. Godine Publisher, 1993. {{ISBN|0-87923-980-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87923-980-0}}. pg.596&lt;/ref&gt; were given the title Transcendent Satrape of the Collège de 'pataphysique). The Alfred Jarry Theatre, founded by [[Antonin Artaud]] and [[Roger Vitrac]], housed several Absurdist plays, including ones by Ionesco and Adamov.&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, pg.170&lt;/ref&gt;

Artaud's "[[Theatre of Cruelty|The Theatre of Cruelty]]" (presented in ''[[Theatre and its Double|The Theatre and Its Double]]'') was a particularly important philosophical treatise. Artaud claimed theatre's reliance on literature was inadequate and that the true power of theatre was in its visceral impact.&lt;ref&gt;Antonin Artaud ''The Theatre and Its Double''.  Tr. Mary Caroline Richards.  New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958., pg. 15–133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Styan, ''Modern'' pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Artaud was a [[Surrealism|Surrealist]], and many other members of the Surrealist group were significant influences on the Absurdists.&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 372–375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gussow. ''Theatre on the edge: new visions, new voices''. Hal Leonard Corporation, 1998. {{ISBN|1-55783-311-7}}. pg. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Rozik. ''The roots of theatre: rethinking ritual and other theories of origin''. University of Iowa Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-87745-817-0}}. pg. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Absurdism is also frequently compared to Surrealism's predecessor, [[Dadaism]] (for example, the Dadaist plays by [[Tristan Tzara]] performed at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] in Zürich).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Drain. ''Twentieth-century theatre: a sourcebook''. Routledge, 1995. {{ISBN|0-415-09619-7}}. pg. 5–7, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Absurdists had direct connections with the Dadaists and Surrealists. Ionesco,&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Ionesco. ''Present past, past present: a personal memoir''. Da Capo Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-306-80835-8}}. pg. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, pg. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; Adamov,&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justin Wintle. ''Makers of modern culture''. Routledge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-26583-5}}. pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and Arrabal&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Innes. ''Avant garde theatre, 1892–1992''.Routledge, 1993. {{ISBN|0-415-06518-6}}. pg. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, were friends with Surrealists still living in Paris at the time including [[Paul Eluard]] and [[André Breton]], the founder of Surrealism, and Beckett translated many Surrealist poems by Breton and others from French into English.&lt;ref&gt;James Knowlson. ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett''. London. Bloomsbury Publishing, 1997. {{ISBN|0-7475-3169-2}}., pg. 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Albright. ''Beckett and aesthetics''.Cambridge University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-521-82908-9}}. pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with existentialism ===

Many of the Absurdists were contemporaries with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], the philosophical spokesman for existentialism in Paris, but few Absurdists actually committed to Sartre's own existentialist philosophy, as expressed in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', and many of the Absurdists had a complicated relationship with him.  Sartre praised Genet's plays, stating that for Genet, "Good is only an illusion. Evil is a Nothingness which arises upon the ruins of Good".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre. "Introduction to ''The Maids; and Deathwatch''" ''The Maids; and Deathwatch''. Grove Press, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8021-5056-X}}. pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ionesco, however, hated Sartre bitterly.&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Ionesco. ''Present Past, Past Present''. Da Capo Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-306-80835-8}}. pg. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Ionesco accused Sartre of supporting Communism but ignoring the atrocities committed by Communists; he wrote ''[[Rhinoceros (play)|Rhinoceros]]'' as a criticism of blind conformity, whether it be to Nazism or Communism; at the end of the play, one man remains on Earth resisting transformation into a rhinoceros&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Ionesco. ''Fragments of a Journal''. Tr. Jean Stewart. London: Faber and Faber, 1968. pg. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosette C. Lamont. ''Ionesco's imperatives: the politics of culture''. University of Michigan Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-472-10310-5}}. pg. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sartre criticized ''Rhinoceros'' by questioning: "Why is there one man who resists? At least we could learn why, but no, we learn not even that. He resists because he is there".&lt;ref&gt;"Beyond Bourgeois Theatre" 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, pg. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sartre's criticism highlights a primary difference between the Theatre of the Absurd and existentialism: the Theatre of the Absurd shows the failure of man without recommending a solution.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1966 interview, [[Claude Bonnefoy]], comparing the Absurdists to Sartre and Camus, said to Ionesco, "It seems to me that Beckett, Adamov and yourself started out less from philosophical reflections or a return to classical sources, than from first-hand experience and a desire to find a new theatrical expression that would enable you to render this experience in all its acuteness and also its immediacy. If Sartre and Camus thought out these themes, you expressed them in a far more vital contemporary fashion". Ionesco replied, "I have the feeling that these writers – who are serious and important – were talking about absurdity and death, but that they never really lived these themes, that they did not feel them within themselves in an almost irrational, visceral way, that all this was not deeply inscribed in their language. With them it was still rhetoric, eloquence. With Adamov and Beckett it really is a very naked reality that is conveyed through the apparent dislocation of language".&lt;ref&gt;Claude Bonnefoy. ''Conversations with Eugène Ionesco''. Trans. Jan Dawson. Holt, Rinehard and Winston, 1971. pg. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to Sartre's concepts of the function of literature, [[Samuel Beckett]]'s primary focus was on the ''failure'' of man to overcome "absurdity" - or the repetition of life even though the end result will be the same no matter what and everything is essentially pointless - as James Knowlson says in ''Damned to Fame'', Beckett's work focuses, "on poverty, failure, exile and loss — as he put it, on man as a 'non-knower' and as a 'non-can-er'&amp;nbsp;."&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, pg. 319&lt;/ref&gt;  Beckett's own relationship with Sartre was complicated by a mistake made in the publication of one of his stories in Sartre's journal ''[[Les Temps Modernes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, pg. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett said, though he liked ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]'', he generally found the writing style of Sartre and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] to be "too philosophical" and he considered himself "not a philosopher".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Cronin, Isaac Cronin. ''Samuel Beckett: the last modernist''. Da Capo Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-306-80898-6}}. pg. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The "Absurd" or "New Theater" movement was originally a Paris-based (and a [[Rive Gauche]]) avant-garde phenomenon tied to extremely small theaters in the [[Quartier Latin]].  Some of the Absurdists, such as [[Jean Genet]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Norrish. ''New tragedy and comedy in France, 1945–1970''.Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1988. {{ISBN|0-389-20746-2}}. pg. 107&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Tardieu]],&lt;ref name = Hardison438&gt;Felicia Hardison Londré, Margot Berthold.

Many other Absurdists were born elsewhere but lived in France, writing often in French: [[Samuel Beckett]] from Ireland;&lt;ref name="Hardison438" /&gt; [[Eugène Ionesco]] from [[Romania]];&lt;ref name="Hardison438" /&gt; [[Arthur Adamov]] from Russia;&lt;ref name="Hardison438" /&gt; [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] from Chile and [[Fernando Arrabal]] from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;David Thatcher Gies. ''The Cambridge companion to modern Spanish culture''. Cambridge University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-521-57429-3}}. pg. 229&lt;/ref&gt;  As the influence of the Absurdists grew, the style spread to other countries—with playwrights either directly influenced by Absurdists in Paris or playwrights labelled Absurdist by critics.  In England some of those whom Esslin considered practitioners of the Theatre of the Absurd include [[Harold Pinter]],&lt;ref name="Hardison438" /&gt; [[Tom Stoppard]],&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle H. Cody, Evert Sprinchorn. ''The Columbia encyclopedia of modern drama''. Columbia University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-231-14424-5}}. pg. 1285.&lt;/ref&gt; [[N. F.

=== Legacy ===
Echoes of elements of "The Theatre of the Absurd" can be seen in the work of many later playwrights, from more [[avant-garde]] or experimental playwrights like [[Suzan-Lori Parks]]—in ''[[The Death of the Last Black Man in the Whole Entire World]]'' and ''[[The America Play]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Enoch Brater. "After the Absurd". ''Around the Absurd: Essays on Modern and Postmodern Drama''. Ed. Enoch Brater and Ruby Cohn. University of Michigan Press, 1990. {{ISBN|978-0-472-10205-1}}. pg. 293–301.&lt;/ref&gt; for example—to relatively realistic playwrights like [[David Mamet]]—in ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]'', which Mamet dedicated to [[Harold Pinter]].&lt;ref&gt;David Mamet.

In addition, the absurd drama has also found its way in [[Urdu literature]], ''Mazaron Ke Phool'' [i.e. Graveyard Flowers] (2008) by contemporary Pakistani writer, poet and columnist Mujtaba Haider Zaidi is the first absurd drama in the history of Urdu literature. Created in the pattern of ancient Greek tragedies, the drama contains only two characters, and carries both poetry and prose in it, and hence fulfills all the requirements necessary for a perfect Absurd drama.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Theatrical features ==
Plays within this group are absurd in that they focus not on logical acts, realistic occurrences, or traditional character development; they, instead, focus on human beings trapped in an incomprehensible world subject to any occurrence, no matter how illogical.&lt;ref&gt;Styan, ''Dark'' 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norrish, pg. 2–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme of incomprehensibility is coupled with the inadequacy of language to form meaningful human connections.&lt;ref name="Lewis260" /&gt; According to Martin Esslin, Absurdism is "the inevitable devaluation of ideals, purity, and purpose"&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  Absurdist drama asks its viewer to "draw his own conclusions, make his own errors".&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Though Theatre of the Absurd may be seen as nonsense, they have something to say and can be understood".&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Esslin makes a distinction between the dictionary definition of absurd ("out of harmony" in the musical sense) and drama's understanding of the Absurd: "Absurd is that which is devoid of purpose... Cut off from his religious, metaphysical, and transcendental roots, man is lost; all his actions become senseless, absurd, useless".&lt;ref&gt;Ionesco in Esslin, pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Characters ===
The characters in Absurdist drama are lost and floating in an incomprehensible universe and they abandon rational devices and discursive thought because these approaches are inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Richardson 1154&lt;/ref&gt; Many characters appear as automatons stuck in routines speaking only in cliché (Ionesco called the Old Man and Old Woman in ''[[Les Chaises|The Chairs]]'' "uber-marrionettes").&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, pg. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?id=85&amp;issue=3|title=Open access journal for Film and Television Studies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters are frequently stereotypical, [[archetype|archetypal]], or flat character types as in [[Commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Cronin, Isaac Cronin. ''Samuel Beckett: the last modernist''. Da Capo Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-306-80898-6}}. pg. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dave Bradby. ''Modern French Drama: 1940–1990''. Cambridge University Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-521-40843-1}}. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Esslin402&gt;Esslin, pg. 402&lt;/ref&gt;

The more complex characters are in crisis because the world around them is incomprehensible.&lt;ref name ="Esslin402" /&gt;  Many of Pinter's plays, for example, feature characters trapped in an enclosed space menaced by some force the character can't understand. Pinter's first play was ''[[The Room (play)|The Room]]'' – in which the main character, Rose, is menaced by Riley who invades her safe space though the actual source of menace remains a mystery&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Burkman. ''The dramatic world of Harold Pinter: its basis in ritual''. Ohio State University Press, 1971 {{ISBN|0-8142-0146-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8142-0146-6}}. pg. 70–73.&lt;/ref&gt; – and this theme of characters in a safe space menaced by an outside force is repeated in many of his later works (perhaps most famously in ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]''). In [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]]'s ''The Visit'' the main character, Alfred, is menaced by Claire Zachanassian; Claire, richest woman in the world with a decaying body and multiple husbands throughout the play, has guaranteed a payout for anyone in the town willing to kill Alfred.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Alan Crockett. ''Understanding Friedrich Dürrenmatt''.Univ of South Carolina Press, 1998. {{ISBN|1-57003-213-0}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57003-213-4}}. pg.81&lt;/ref&gt; Characters in Absurdist drama may also face the chaos of a world that science and logic have abandoned. Ionesco's recurring character Berenger, for example, faces a killer without motivation in ''[[Tueur sans gages|The Killer]]'', and Berenger's logical arguments fail to convince the killer that killing is wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Cabell Pronko. ''Avant-garde: the experimental theater in France''. University of California Press, 1966. pg. 96–102.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Rhinoceros (play)|Rhinocéros]]'', Berenger remains the only human on Earth who hasn’t turned into a rhinoceros and must decide whether or not to conform.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom. ''Bloom's Major Dramatists: Eugène Ionesco''. 2003. Infobase Publishing. p106-110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Heilman. ''The Ghost on the Ramparts''. University of Georgia Press, 2008 {{ISBN|0-8203-3265-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8203-3265-9}}. pg. 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt; Characters may find themselves trapped in a routine, or in a metafictional conceit, trapped in a story; the title characters in [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', for example, find themselves in a story (''[[Hamlet]]'') in which the outcome has already been written.&lt;ref name = Bradby59&gt;Bradby, ''Modern'' pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor L. Cahn. ''Beyond Absurdity: The Plays of Tom Stoppard''. London: Associated University Presses, 1979. pg. 36–39. Cahn asserts that though Stoppard begain writing in the Absurdist mode, in his increasing focus on order, optimism, and the redemptive power of art, Stoppard has moved "beyond" Absurdism, as the title implies.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plots of many Absurdist plays feature characters in interdependent pairs, commonly either two males or a male and a female. Some Beckett scholars call this the "pseudocouple".&lt;ref&gt;Ackerley, pg. 334, 465, 508&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Astro. ''Understanding Samuel Beckett''. Univ of South Carolina Press, 1990
{{ISBN|0-87249-686-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87249-686-6}}. pg. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The two characters may be roughly equal or have a begrudging interdependence (like Vladimir and Estragon in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''&lt;ref name="Bradby59" /&gt; or the two main characters in ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]''); one character may be clearly dominant and may torture the passive character (like Pozzo and Lucky in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' or Hamm and Clov in ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]''); the relationship of the characters may shift dramatically throughout the play (as in Ionesco's ''[[La Leçon|The Lesson]]''&lt;ref name = Hinden401&gt;Hinden, pg. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; or in many of Albee's plays, ''[[The Zoo Story]]''&lt;ref name = Kane159&gt;Leslie Kane. ''The language of silence: on the unspoken and the unspeakable in modern drama''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1984. {{ISBN|0-8386-3187-8}}. pg. 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa M. Siefker Bailey, Bruce J. Mann. ''Edward Albee: A Casebook''. 2003. Routledge. pg. 33–44.&lt;/ref&gt; for example).

=== Language ===
Despite its reputation for nonsense language, much of the dialogue in Absurdist plays is naturalistic.  The moments when characters resort to nonsense language or clichés—when words appear to have lost their denotative function, thus creating misunderstanding among the characters—make the Theatre of the Absurd distinctive.&lt;ref name="Lewis260" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Language frequently gains a certain phonetic, rhythmical, almost musical quality, opening up a wide range of often comedic playfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Albee, Philip C. Kolin. ''Conversations with Edward Albee''. Univ. Press of Mississippi, 1988. {{ISBN|0-87805-342-5}}. pg. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jean Tardieu]], for example, in the series of short pieces ''Theatre de Chambre'' arranged the language as one arranges music.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Cabell Pronko. ''Avant-Garde''. University of California Press, 2003. pg.155–156&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctively Absurdist language ranges from meaningless clichés to vaudeville-style word play to meaningless nonsense.&lt;ref name="Hinden401" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeanette R. Malkin. ''Verbal Violence in Contemporary Drama: From Handke to Shepard''. Cambridge University Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-521-38335-8}}. pg. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Bald Soprano'', for example, was inspired by a language book in which characters would exchange empty clichés that never ultimately amounted to true communication or true connection.&lt;ref&gt;Styan, ''Dark'' pg. 221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erich Segal. ''The Death of Comedy''. Harvard University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-01247-X}} pg. 422.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the characters in ''The Bald Soprano''—like many other Absurdist characters—go through routine dialogue full of clichés without actually communicating anything substantive or making a human connection.&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guido Almansi, Simon Henderson. ''Harold Pinter''. Routledge, 1983. {{ISBN|0-416-31710-3}}. pg. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the dialogue is purposefully elliptical; the language of Absurdist Theater becomes secondary to the poetry of the concrete and objectified images of the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, pg. 17, 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of Beckett's plays devalue language for the sake of the striking tableau.&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  Harold Pinter—famous for his "Pinter pause"—presents more subtly elliptical dialogue; often the primary things characters should address are replaced by ellipsis or dashes.  The following exchange between Aston and Davies in ''[[The Caretaker]]'' is typical of Pinter:

:ASTON. More or less exactly what you...
:DAVIES.  That's it … that's what I'm getting at is … I mean, what sort of jobs … (''Pause''.)
:ASTON. Well, there's things like the stairs … and the … the bells …
:DAVIES. But it'd be a matter … wouldn't it … it'd be a matter of a broom … isn't it?&lt;ref&gt;Harold Pinter. ''The Caretaker''. DPS, 1991.{{ISBN|0822201844}}, pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the dialogue in Absurdist drama (especially in Beckett's and Albee's plays, for example) reflects this kind of evasiveness and inability to make a connection.&lt;ref name="Kane159" /&gt;  When language that is apparently nonsensical appears, it also demonstrates this disconnection.  It can be used for comic effect, as in Lucky's long speech in ''Godot'' when Pozzo says Lucky is demonstrating a talent for "thinking" as other characters comically attempt to stop him:

:LUCKY.  Given the existence as uttered forth in the public works of Puncher and Wattmann of a personal God quaquaquaqua with white beard quaquaquaqua outside time without extension who from the heights of divine apathia divine athambia divine aphasia loves us dearly with some exceptions for reasons unknown but time will tell and suffers like the divine Miranda with those who for reasons unknown but time will tell are plunged in torment...&lt;ref&gt;David Bradby. ''Beckett, Waiting for Godot''. Camberidge University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-521-59510-X}}, pg. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonsense may also be used abusively, as in Pinter's ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' when Goldberg and McCann torture Stanley with apparently nonsensical questions and [[non sequitur (humor)|non-sequiturs]]:

:GOLDBERG.  What do you use for pajamas?
:STANLEY.  Nothing.
:GOLDBERG.  You verminate the sheet of your birth.
:MCCANN.  What about the Albigensenist heresy?
:GOLDBERG.  Who watered the wicket in Melbourne?
:MCCANN.  What about the blessed Oliver Plunkett?
:GOLDBERG.  Speak up Webber.  Why did the chicken cross the road?&lt;ref&gt;Harold Pinter. ''The Birthday Party and The Room: Two Plays''. Grove Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-8021-5114-0}}. pg. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the above examples, nonsense in Absurdist theatre may be also used to demonstrate the limits of language while questioning or parodying the determinism of science and the knowability of truth.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Williams. "''The Birthday Party'': Harold Pinter". ''Modern Critical Views: Harold Pinter''. New York: Chelsea House Publishers, 1987. {{ISBN|0-87754-706-8}}. pg. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Silverstein. ''Harold Pinter and the language of cultural power''. Bucknell University Press, 1993 {{ISBN|0-8387-5236-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8387-5236-4}}. pg. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hornby. ''Drama, Metadrama and perception''. Associated University Presse, 1986 {{ISBN|0-8387-5101-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8387-5101-5}}. pg. 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Ionesco's ''The Lesson'', a professor tries to force a pupil to understand his nonsensical philology lesson:

:PROFESSOR.  … In Spanish: the roses of my grandmother are as yellow as my grandfather who is Asiatic; in Latin: the roses of my grandmother are as yellow as my grandfather who is Asiatic.  Do you detect the difference?  Translate this into … Romanian
:PUPIL.  The … how do you say "roses" in Romanian?
:PROFESSOR.  But "roses", what else? … "roses" is a translation in Oriental of the French word "roses", in Spanish "roses", do you get it? In Sardanapali, "roses"...&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Ionesco. ''The Bald Soprano and Other Plays''. Grove Press, 1982. {{ISBN|0-8021-3079-8}}. pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plot ===
Traditional plot structures are rarely a consideration in The Theatre of the Absurd.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Schumacher. ''Encyclopedia of Literature &amp; Criticism''. 1990. Routledge. pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Plots can consist of the absurd repetition of cliché and routine, as in ''Godot'' or ''[[The Bald Soprano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Homan. ''Beckett's theaters: interpretations for performance''. Bucknell University Press, 1984. {{ISBN|0-8387-5064-8}}. pg. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often there is a menacing outside force that remains a mystery; in ''The Birthday Party'', for example, Goldberg and McCann confront Stanley, torture him with absurd questions, and drag him off at the end, but it is never revealed why.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, pg. 132, 134&lt;/ref&gt; In later Pinter plays, such as ''The Caretaker''&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Burkman. ''The dramatic world of Harold Pinter: its basis in ritual''. Ohio State University Press, 1971. {{ISBN|0-8142-0146-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8142-0146-6}}. pg. 76–89&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Homecoming'',&lt;ref&gt;Marc Silverstein. ''Harold Pinter and the language of cultural power''. Bucknell University Press, 1993.{{ISBN|0-8387-5236-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8387-5236-4}}. pg. 76–94.&lt;/ref&gt; the menace is no longer entering from the outside but exists within the confined space. Other Absurdists use this kind of plot, as in Edward Albee's ''[[A Delicate Balance (play)|A Delicate Balance]]'': Harry and Edna take refuge at the home of their friends Agnes and Tobias because they suddenly become frightened.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen James Bottoms. ''The Cambridge Companion to Edward Albee''. Cambridge University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-521-83455-4}}. pg. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  They have difficulty explaining what has frightened them:

:HARRY: There was nothing … but we were very scared.
:EDNA: We … were … terrified.
:HARRY: We were scared.  It was like being lost: very young again, with the dark, and lost.  There was no … thing … to be … frightened of, but …
:EDNA: WE WERE FRIGHTENED … AND THERE WAS NOTHING.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Albee. ''A delicate balance: a play in three acts''. Samuel French, Inc., 1994. {{ISBN|0-573-60792-3}}. pg. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Absence, emptiness, nothingness, and unresolved mysteries are central features in many Absurdist plots:&lt;ref&gt;Les Essif. ''Empty figure on an empty stage: the theatre of Samuel Beckett and his generation''. Indiana University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-253-33847-6}}. pg. 1–9&lt;/ref&gt; for example, in ''The Chairs'' an old couple welcomes a large number of guests to their home, but these guests are invisible so all we see is empty chairs, a representation of their absence.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Rayner. ''Ghosts: death's double and the phenomena of theatre''. U of Minnesota Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-8166-4544-2}}. pg. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the action of ''Godot'' is centered around the absence of a man named Godot, for whom the characters perpetually wait.  In many of Beckett's later plays, most features are stripped away and what's left is a minimalistic tableau: a woman walking slowly back and forth in ''[[Footfalls]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Morris Beja, S. E. Gontarski, Pierre A. G. Astier. ''Samuel Beckett—humanistic perspectives''.Ohio State University Press, 1983. {{ISBN|0-8142-0334-5}}. pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt; for example, or in ''[[Breath (play)|Breath]]'' only a junk heap on stage and the sounds of breathing.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Astro. ''Understanding Samuel Beckett''. Univ of South Carolina Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-87249-686-4}}. pg. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruby Cohn. ''A Beckett Canon''. University of Michigan Press, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-472-11190-9}} pg. 298, 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot may also revolve around an unexplained metamorphosis, a supernatural change, or a shift in the laws of physics.  For example, in Ionesco's ''[[Amédée ou comment s'en débarrasser|Amédée, or How to Get Rid of It]]'', a couple must deal with a corpse that is steadily growing larger and larger; Ionesco never fully reveals the identity of the corpse, how this person died, or why it's continually growing, but the corpse ultimately – and, again, without explanation – floats away.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, pg. 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justin Wintle. ''The Makers of Modern Culture''. Routledge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-26583-5}}. pg. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jean Tardieu's "The Keyhole" a lover watches a woman through a keyhole as she removes her clothes and then her flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Pronko, pg. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Pirandello, many Absurdists use meta-theatrical techniques to explore role fulfillment, fate, and the theatricality of theatre.  This is true for many of Genet's plays: for example, in ''The Maids'', two maids pretend to be their mistress; in ''The Balcony'' brothel patrons take on elevated positions in role-playing games, but the line between theatre and reality starts to blur.  Another complex example of this is ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead]]'': it's a play about two minor characters in ''[[Hamlet]]''; these characters, in turn, have various encounters with the players who perform ''The Mousetrap'', the play-within-the-play in ''Hamlet''.&lt;ref name="Bradby59" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;June Schlueter. ''Metafictional Characters in Modern Drama''. Columbia University Press, 1979. {{ISBN|0-231-04752-5}}. pg. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In Stoppard's ''Travesties'', James Joyce and Tristan Tzara slip in and out of the plot of ''The Importance of Being Earnest''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter K. W. Tan, Tom Stoppard. ''A stylistics of drama: with special focus on Stoppard's Travesties''. NUS Press, 1993. {{ISBN|9971-69-182-5}}, {{ISBN|978-9971-69-182-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plots are frequently cyclical:&lt;ref name="Hinden401" /&gt; for example, ''Endgame'' begins where the play ended&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Burkman. ''Myth and ritual in the plays of Samuel Beckett''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1987. {{ISBN|0-8386-3299-8}}. pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; – at the beginning of the play, Clov says, "Finished, it's finished, nearly finished, it must be nearly finished"&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett. ''Endgame: a play in one act, followed by Act without words, a mime for one player''.Grove Press, 1958. {{ISBN|0-8021-5024-1}}. pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; – and themes of cycle, routine, and repetition are explored throughout.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Karpati Kennedy|Andrew K. Kennedy]]. ''Samuel Beckett''. Cambridge University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-521-27488-5}}. pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Totally Fun Company''' is a [[theme park]] design company started by Peter Alexander, former [[Disney Imagineer]], Universal Studios creative executive and [[Six Flags]] [[executive producer]], based in Tampa, Florida.

While at [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] (then WED Enterprises) Alexander served as Director of Project Management for [[EPCOT]] and [[Tokyo Disneyland]].  In 1982 he moved to Universal Studios where he became Executive Producer of [[Universal Studios Florida]] from the initial creation of the park through its opening in 1990.  Working with Bob Ward, he created [[Kongfrontation]], and [[E.T. Adventure]] and [[Back to the Future: The Ride]] with [[Steven Spielberg]].  Other rides included [[The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera (ride)|The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera]] with Mario Kamberg and [[Earthquake: The Big One]]. After the opening of Universal Studios, Alexander started the Totally Fun Company.

After leaving Universal in 1991, Alexander first created two TV pilots for [[Nickelodeon]].  The first, ''Go For It'' was a pilot only, but lead to his writing the treatment and doing concept illustrations for the long running Nick series ''[[Guts (TV series)|Guts]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1101">The '''Venus Throw''' was the highest roll in the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] gambling game of ''tali'' ([[knucklebones]]). The game was played with four 4-sided rectangular dice numbered I, III, IV and VI, usually made from sheep's or goat's knucklebones.  In a Venus Throw, each ''talus''  landed on a different side, yielding as a score of 14.  A gambler would either throw the ''tali'' from his or her hand, or from a small box, (called a ''fritillus'').  Thirty-five different throws were possible.  While the Venus throw was the highest, the Vulture throw (all aces)&amp;nbsp;— also known as the Dog throw&amp;nbsp;— was the lowest.  The Venus throw could be used to designate the master of the revels.

''The Venus Throw'' is also a novel in the [[Roma Sub Rosa]] series set in ancient republican Rome by author [[Steven Saylor]].

==Early life and education==

At age 11, she started singing with the Tampa-based children's performing arts troupe, Entertainment Revue.&lt;ref name=mtv/&gt; She attended [[East Bay High School]] in [[Gibsonton, Florida]].

==Career==

===Music career===
In 1999, the 18-year-old Ford started performing under the stage name Mandah and was signed to [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]].&lt;ref name=mtv/&gt; Ford was later dropped from MCA and signed by [[Atlantic Records]]. Atlantic placed one of Ford's songs, "Lullaby," on the soundtrack for ''[[Pokémon: The First Movie]]''. Ford changed her stage name from Mandah to Willa Ford in order to avoid confusion with [[Mandy Moore]].&lt;ref name=mtv/&gt;

In 2000, she was one of the opening acts on the [[Backstreet Boys]]' "Into the Millennium" tour.

In 2001, Ford signed on to a new label, Lava [[Atlantic Records]], while on a [[Shopping mall|mall tour]] for [[Nautica (clothing company)|Nautica Kids]]. Ford wrote most of her own lyrics and served as executive [[Record producer|producer]] for most of her first album. On July 17, 2001, she released ''[[Willa Was Here]]''. The album included the single "[[I Wanna Be Bad]]" which featured rapper [[Royce da 5'9"]]. ''Willa Was Here'' reached 56 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and sold approximately 200,000 copies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Ford went on to release a second single from the album, "[[Did Ya' Understand That]]," which failed to garner much attention. Later she explained the reason as the song was released on September 11, 2001 and ruined by the terrorists' attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7880907/willa-ford-i-wanna-be-bad-interview |title=Willa Ford Explains Why She Left Music -- And Teases a Possible Comeback |author= Kaplan, Ilana |date=July 25, 2017 |accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Ooh Ooh" was released as a promotional single, but also failed to find success.

Ford was a spokesperson for [[Pantene]] Pro-V's ProVoice campaign while promoting the album. She also appeared in [[Uncle Kracker]]'s [[Music video|video]] for "In A Little While."

The song, titled "Nastified," appeared on Park's fifth album, ''Man.''

In 2003, Ford released a song titled "[[A Toast to Men]]." The song, which featured guest rapper [[Lady May]], was featured in daytime promotional ads for soap operas. The single came from her unreleased second album ''Sexysexobsessive'', which was previously titled ''Porn Poetry''. The title track, "Sexysexobsessive," was to be the second single, but it was only released through Ford's official website.

From 2005 to 2006, she appeared as a guest doll in [[Pussycat Dolls]]' show at the club in [[Las Vegas]]. In 2010, she released the first song since 2003 "All This Time" online, collaborated with [[Riley Smith]].

'''Yolanda Mero''' (aka Jolanda Mero;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicalmusicguide.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=24883&amp;start=0 Classical Music Guide Forums]&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian spelling '''Mérő'''; later '''Mero-Irion''') (30 August 1887{{spaced ndash}}17 October 1963)&lt;ref name=women/&gt; was a [[Hungarian-American]] pianist, opera and theatre impresario, and philanthropist who supported destitute musicians.

==Pianist==
Yolanda Mero was born into a [[Hungarian Jews|Jewish family]] in [[Budapest]] to Salamon Mérő and Rozalia (née Pick).&lt;ref name=women&gt;[http://www.pianowomen.com/yesterday.html Women at the Piano]&lt;/ref&gt; She began studying at the age of 8 at the National Conservatory with Augusta Rennebaum, a pupil of [[Franz Liszt]].&lt;ref name=CO&gt;[http://www.classicsonline.com/catalogue/product.aspx?pid=484 Classics Online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708163224/http://www.classicsonline.com/catalogue/product.aspx?pid=484 |date=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her debut at age 15 with the [[Dresden Philharmonic]], then toured the world for four years.&lt;ref name=auto&gt;[http://www.rgrossmusicautograph.com/instrumental75.html rgross.musicautograph.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724191958/http://www.rgrossmusicautograph.com/instrumental75.html |date=July 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to the [[United States]]  in 1900, first appearing in New York in 1909, with the Russian Symphony Orchestra.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lXag39roRosC&amp;pg=PA182 Susana Salgado, The Teatro Solis: 150 Years of Opera, Concert and Ballet in Montevideo]&lt;/ref&gt;

A week after arriving in New York, she met Hermann Irion, an executive of the Steinway Piano company, and married him only four weeks later, on 16&amp;nbsp;December 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/12/17/101909032.pdf New York Times, 17 December 1909]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/12/17/101909111.pdf New York Times, 17 December 1909]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US she played concertos under the baton of [[Gustav Mahler]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kB6vuf0aGOgC&amp;pg=PA310 Gustav Mahler’s American Years, 1907-1911]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leopold Stokowski]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classical.net/music/guide/society/lssa/concertregister.php Classical Net]&lt;/ref&gt; and others. She later had a teaching post at her alma mater in Budapest.&lt;ref name=CO/&gt;

Her verve and bravura, but also her wayward approach, were noted. In a review of her concert at New York's Aeolian Hall in January 1919, [[James Huneker]] wrote that "... she transformed Chopin preludes into veritable typhoons", and "... in the [[Barcarole (Chopin)|Barcarolle]], instead of gondolas and the vows of lovers, moonlight and soft Adriatic zephyrs, we were shown a huge warship that steamed through the Grand Canal, sirens screaming, cannons booming, and a band playing Hungarian Rhapsody by Liszt."&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/01/14/109331138.pdf New York Times, 14 January 1919]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==

==Radio activist==
She also became an activist in the cause of improving the quality of the content of radio broadcasts, launching attacks on soap operas and advertising.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LzgaoIIkwKEC&amp;pg=PA139 Kathy M Newman, Radio active: advertising and consumer activism, 1935-47]&lt;/ref&gt; She was founder and chairman of the Women's National Radio Committee and created the Gold Microphone Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/7968844 Live Auctioneers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7xkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT6 Billboard, 18 May 1946]&lt;/ref&gt;
