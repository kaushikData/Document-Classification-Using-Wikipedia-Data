      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5531">'''Alexander Haggerty Krappe''' (6 July 1894 – 30 November 1947) was a [[folklorist]] and [[author]]. Along with [[Francis Peabody Magoun]], he was the first  translator of folktales collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]] into the English language. He was also a linguist, teacher, translator of scientific and other materials, a Roman [[philologist]], a [[comparative mythologist]], a classicist and Scandinavianist. 

Despite his contributions and academic writing, his work has been overlooked in the modern [[Folklore]] discipline as he staunchly denied the existence of American Folklore.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

== Biography ==
Alexander Haggerty Krappe was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in 1884. His childhood was said to be unhappy, and after his parents divorced, he was taken back to Europe by his German-born father. Krappe received his education in the Leibniz und Siemen's Oberealschuel in Charlottenberg, Berlin. An accomplished student, he remained at the university until 1915 upon his decision to study modern languages. Thus Krappe spent 1915-1916 studying medieval history and Romance languages at the [[University of Berlin]].

Krappe went on to enter the [[University of Iowa]] in Iowa City on a graduate fellowship, and received his M.A. with a major in French and a minor in Italian. The capstone of his M.A., his thesis was entitled "The Chronology of the old French Chanson de Geste." In January 1918, he began doctoral work at the [[University of Chicago]] on another graduate fellowship. In 1919, Krappe received a Ph.D. His work in university established his interest in epic and [[medieval literature]].

In 1919, Krappe married Edith Smith, the daughter of Folklorist Grace Partridge Smith. Edith would go on to describe her husband as "brilliant, but deeply troubled and enigmatic man when all of the sources are combined, it is the picture that emerges."

Krappe died on November 30, 1947 in [[Iowa City, Iowa]], leaving three book-length manuscripts. The most significant of these, and only one published, was a translation of Grimm's Collected Fairy Tales in conjunction with [[Francis Peabody Magoun]].{{sfn|Burson|1982}}

== Krappe's definition of folklore ==
In his book ''The Science of Folklore'' he stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Folklore is a historical science, having its own methods of research and admitting of the same system of checks and verifications as any other. With its sister sciences it may combine to make up the cycle of our knowledge of man's past life. From this follows that it may assume the rank of an ancillary science to any or all of them, and it has done so repeatedly, notably to the various philogies, history, ethnography, and the history of religion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Science of Folklore&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Krappe's definition of folksong ==
Krappe's work also extended into the field of folksong, his own scholarly definition &lt;blockquote&gt;
"The folksong is a song, i.e a lyric poem with melody, which originated anonymously, among unlettered folk in times past and which remained in currency for a considerable time, as a rule for centuries . . . The American Kentucky Home, though it is supposed to have originated in circle of a somewhat darker hue than is popular in certain sections of the country, is a genuine folksong of both colored and white people&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This also serves as a prime example of Krappe's unpopularity among Folklorists and anthropologists, as Krappe's work many times shows him to be racist and sexist.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = American Folklore | first = Jan Harold | last = Brunvand | authorlink = Jan Harold Brunvand | year = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Don Antonio Alcalá Galiano, ministro de Fomento (Museo del Prado).jpg|thumb|215px|Antonio Alcalá Galiano, portrait by [[Vicente Palmaroli]]]] 
'''Antonio Alcalá Galiano y Fernández de Villavicencio''', (22 July 1789, [[Cádiz]] – 11 April 1865, [[Madrid]]) was a Spanish politician and writer who served as Minister of the Navy (1836) and [[Ministry of Public Works and Transport (Spain)|Minister of Public Works]] (1865). He was elected a [[Deputy (legislator)|Deputy]] for Cádiz in 1822 and served sporadically through ten successive legislatures, until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDIndHistDip?_piref73_1340024_73_1340023_1340023.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXLDA.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-25&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;QUERY=%282520%29.NDIP. Histórico de Diputados 1810 – 1977.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Biography ==
He was born to an influential military family. His father, the explorer [[Dionisio Alcalá Galiano]], was killed at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] and his uncle, Don {{ill|Juan María de Villavicencio|es}}, was [[Captain general]] of the Armada and a [[Regent]] of the Kingdom during the interregnum in the reign of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]].

After his secondary studies at the "{{ill|Real Colegio de la Purísima Concepción de Cabra|es}}" (now known as "IES Aguilar y Eslava"), he travelled through the Mediterranean with his father and spent some time in Naples. In 1806, he enrolled as a cadet in the "Guardias Marinas Españolas" and the following year was named [[Master (naval)|Master]] at the port of Seville. He was married in 1808, but separated from his wife seven years later; because, it is believed, of her infidelity due to his ugliness. After that, he briefly gained a reputation as a [[libertine]] and drunkard. 

He abandoned his military career in 1812 and became a "Doceañista" (a supporter of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]]). Two years later, together with {{ill|José Joaquín de Mora|es}}, he came out against the German reactionary [[Romanticism]] advocated by [[Juan Nicolás Böhl de Faber]] but, after his stay in London, came to support the new aesthetic and wrote a prologue to ''El moro expósito'' (The [[Moors|Moor]] Exposed), by his friend [[Ángel de Saavedra, 3rd Duke of Rivas|Ángel de Saavedra]]; the manifesto of Spanish Romanticism.

He participated in the conspiracy that ended with the triumph of [[Rafael del Riego]] in 1820 and was considered to be a great orator; defending Liberalism during the [[Trienio Liberal]]. When Ferdinand VII was restored to power after the [[Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis|French invasion]], he was forced into self-exile in London. 

While there, he survived by teaching Spanish language and literature classes then, from 1828 to 1830, held the Chair of Spanish at the newly created [[University College London|University College]]. Until then, he had been a great admirer of [[Montesquieu]], but soon absorbed English ways of thinking, befriended [[Jeremy Bentham]], became attracted to the moderate liberalism of [[Edmund Burke]] and rejected abstract principles in favor of [[utilitarianism]], then adopted the doctrinaire liberalism of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] and  [[Benjamin Constant]]. He returned to Spain in 1833, after [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] became Queen, and joined the Liberal cabinet of [[Juan Álvarez Mendizábal]]. 

From that time, he held several ministerial positions and ambassadorships. In 1835, he was one of the co-founders of the [[Ateneo de Madrid]]. In 1863, he became a member of the [[Real Academia de la Historia]], followed by a membership at the [[Real Academia de Ciencias Morales y Políticas]].  

He wrote a detailed autobiography, published posthumously in two versions: ''Recuerdos de un anciano'' (1878) and ''Memorias'' (1886). He was also a literary critic. His most notable work in that genre being ''Lecciones de literatura española, francesa, inglesa e italiana del siglo XVIII''. He also composed some ''Lecciones de derecho político y constitucional'' (1843). The author, [[Juan Valera]], was his nephew.

[[Image:BobbioOrosiusCarpetPage.jpg|thumb|200px|Folio 1v of the Bobbio Orosius contains the oldest surviving carpet page in any insular manuscript.]]

The '''Bobbio Orosius''' (Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana MS D. 23. Sup.) is an early 7th century [[Insular script|Insular]] [[manuscript]] of the ''[[Chronicon (Orosius)|Chronicon]]'' of [[Paulus Orosius]]. The manuscript has 48 [[folio]]s and measures 210 by 150&amp;nbsp;mm. It is thought to have been produced at the [[scriptorium]] of [[Bobbio Abbey]]. 

It contains the earliest surviving [[carpet page]] in Insular art. The carpet page is on folio 1v. Although it is simpler in design than later carpet pages and contains motifs not found in later carpet pages, it shows a subtlety of pattern and alternation of colors common to Insular manuscripts. It consists of a large central [[Rosette (design)|rosette]] surrounded by four corner rosettes, all contained within a rectangular frame. The vertical panels of the frame contain cable motifs; the frame on the left has a single larger cable of white on pink, while the frame on the right has two smaller cables of white on pink separated by a yellow bar. The upper and lower panels are broken into smaller square panels separated by thin bars. The smaller panels are composed of [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]]s and triangles that alternate in pink and yellow. The side top and bottom panels continue to the right edge of the frame. Above the left vertical frame there are two square frames containing circular motifs; the top with a cross inside a circle, and the bottom with a rosette. The cross within the circle in the top panel is similar to the cross within a circle found in the center of the carpet page on folio 192v of the ''[[Book of Durrow]]''. Six concentric circles surround the central rosette. The page is faded and damaged so that it is difficult to be certain of its original appearance. It has been suggested that the carpet page is later addition to the manuscript.

The carpet page faces the first page of text in the manuscript. The initial P and the opening words ''Praeceptis tuis par(rui)'' are many times larger than the rest of the text and are of hollow shafted capitals, with stem of the P descending the entire length of the text block. The capitals are filled with pink and orange pigment.  There is an initial D on folio 5 which is outlined by dots and is filled with orange. There is also a larger initial N on folio 33 that has a cable pattern in white on orange in the uprights. The crossing bar is green, while orange dots fill the background.

The manuscript comes from Bobbio Abbey, which was founded by Saint [[Columbanus]] in 612. It appears in an inventory of the monastic library done in 1461. The monks gave the manuscript to the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana|Ambrosian Library]] when it was founded in 1606 by Cardinal [[Federico Borromeo]].

In [[linguistics]], '''branching''' refers to the shape of the [[parse tree]]s that represent the structure of sentences.&lt;ref&gt;For a comprehensive discussion of branching, see Berg (2009:34ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming that the language is being written or transcribed from [[left to right]], parse trees that grow down and to the right are ''right-branching'', and parse trees that grow down and to the left are ''left-branching''. The direction of branching reflects the position of [[head (linguistics)|heads]] in [[phrase]]s, and in this regard, right-branching structures are ''[[head-initial]]'', whereas left-branching structures are ''head-final''.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning the correlation between head position and branching direction, see Payne (2006:194).&lt;/ref&gt; English has both right-branching (head-initial) and left-branching (head-final) structures, although it is more right-branching than left-branching.&lt;ref&gt;The tendency for English to be right-branching is widely acknowledged, e.g. van Riemsdijk and Williams (1986:211).&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] are almost fully left-branching (head-final). Some languages are mostly right-branching (head-initial).

==Examples==
Languages typically construct phrases with a [[head (linguistics)|head word]] (or nucleus) and zero or more ''dependents'' (modifiers). The following phrases show the phrase heads in bold. 

Examples of left-branching phrases (= head-final phrases):
::the '''house''' &lt;small&gt;- Noun phrase (NP)&lt;/small&gt;
::very '''happy''' &lt;small&gt;- Adjective phrase (AP)&lt;/small&gt;
::too '''slowly''' &lt;small&gt;- Adverb phrase (AdvP)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Examples of right-branching phrases (= head-initial phrases):
::'''laugh''' loudly &lt;small&gt;- Verb phrase (VP)&lt;/small&gt;
::'''with''' luck &lt;small&gt;- Prepositional phrase (PP)&lt;/small&gt;
::'''that''' it happened &lt;small&gt;- Subordinator phrase (SP = subordinate clause)&lt;/small&gt;

Examples of phrases that contain both left- and right-branching (= head-medial phrases):
::the '''house''' there &lt;small&gt;- Noun phrase (NP)&lt;/small&gt;
::very '''happy''' with it &lt;small&gt;- Adjective phrase (AP)&lt;/small&gt;
::only '''laugh''' loudly &lt;small&gt;- Verb phrase (VP)&lt;/small&gt;

Concerning phrases such as ''the house'' and ''the house there'', this article assumes the traditional NP analysis, meaning that the noun is deemed to be head over the determiner. On a DP-analysis ([[determiner phrase]]), the phrase ''the house'' would be right-branching instead of left-branching.

==Tree structures==
Left- and right-branching structures are illustrated with the trees that follow. Each example appears twice, once according to a constituency-based analysis associated with a [[phrase structure grammar]]&lt;ref&gt;Phrase structure grammars are those grammars that follow in the tradition of Chomsky (1957).&lt;/ref&gt; and once according to a dependency-based analysis associated with a [[dependency grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;Dependency grammars are those grammars that follow in the tradition of Tesnière (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; The first group of trees illustrate left-branching:

:::[[File:Branching1.jpg|Branching picture 1]]

The upper row shows the constituency-based structures, and the lower row the dependency-based structures. In the constituency-based structures, left-branching is present (but not really visible) in so far as the non-head daughter is to the left of the head. In the corresponding dependency-based structures in the lower row, the left-branching is clear; the dependent appears to the left of its head, the branch extending down to the left. The following structures demonstrate right-branching:

:::[[File:Branching2.jpg|Branching picture 2]]

The upper row again shows the constituency-based structures, and the lower row the dependency-based structures. The constituency-based structures are right-branching insofar as the non-head daughter is to the right of the head. This right-branching is completely visible in the lower row of dependency-based structures, where the branch extends down to the right. The (c)-examples contain one instance of right-branching (the upper branch) and one instance of left-branching (the lower branch). The following trees illustrate phrases that combine both types of branching:

:::[[File:Branching3.jpg|Branching picture 3]]

The combination of left- and right-branching is now completely visible in both the constituency- and dependency-based trees. The head appears in a medial position, which means that the phrase combines both types of branching. Note that the (b)-trees also contain a PP phrase that is an instance of pure right-branching.

==Full trees==
The nature of branching is most visible with full trees. The following trees have been chosen to illustrate the extent to which a structure can be entirely left- or entirely right-branching. The following sentence is completely left-branching. The constituency-based trees are on the left, and the dependency-based trees are on the right:&lt;ref&gt;For similar, constituency-based examples of purely left- and then purely right-branching structures, see Fowler (1971:125f.).&lt;/ref&gt; 

:::[[File:Branching4.jpg|Branching picture 4]]

The category Po (= possessive) is used to label possessive '''s''. The following sentence is completely right-branching:

:::[[File:Branching5.jpg|Branching picture 5]]

Most structures in English are, however, not completely left- or completely right-branching, but rather they combine both. The following trees illustrate what can be seen as a stereotypical combination of left- and right-branching in English:

:::[[File:Branching6.jpg|Branching picture 6]]

Determiners (e.g. ''the'') always and subjects (e.g. ''the child'') usually appear on left branches in English, but infinitival verbs (e.g. ''try'', ''eat'') and the verb particle ''to'' usually appear on right branches. In the big picture, right-branching structures tend to outnumber the left-branching structures in English, which means that trees usually grow down to the right.

==X-bar schema==
The [[X-bar theory|X-bar schema]]&lt;ref&gt;See Chomsky (1970) and Jackendoff (1977) for the discussions of the X-bar schema.&lt;/ref&gt; combines left- and right-branching. The standard X-bar schema has the following structure:

:::[[File:Branching7.jpg|Branching picture 7]]

This structure is both left- and right branching. It is left-branching insofar as the bar-level projection of the head (X') follows the specifier, but it is right-branching insofar as the actual head (X&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) precedes the complement. Despite these conflicting traits, most standard X-bar structures (in English) are more right-branching than left-branching because specifiers tend to be less complex (i.e. fewer words) than complements.

==Binary vs. n-ary branching==
Much work in [[Government and Binding Theory]] (GB), the [[Minimalist Program]] (MP), and [[Lexical Functional Grammar]] (LFG) assumes all branching to be binary.&lt;ref&gt;The work of Larson (1988) and Kayne (1981, 1994) were influential in establishing strictly binary branching structures in the tradition of Chomskyan syntax.&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories (both constituency- and dependency-based ones), e.g. early [[Transformational Grammar]], [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]], [[Meaning-Text Theory]], [[Word grammar|Word Grammar]], etc. allow for n-ary branching. This distinction can have a profound impact on the overall nature of the theory of syntax. The two main possibilities in a phrase structure grammar are illustrated with the following trees:

:::[[File:Branching8.jpg|Branching picture 8]]

The binary branching on the left is closely associated with the structures of GB, MP, and LFG, and it is similar to what the X-bar schema assumes. The n-ary branching structure on the right is a more traditional approach to branching. One can muster arguments for both approaches. For instance, the critics of the strictly binary branching structures charge that the strict binarity is motivated more by a desire for theoretical purity than by empirical observation.

Strictly binary branching structures increase the amount of syntactic structure (number of nodes) to the upper limit of what is possible, whereas flatter n-ary branching tends to restrict the amount of structure that the theory can assume. Worth noting in this area is that the more layered the syntactic structures are, the more [[discontinuity (linguistics)|discontinuities]] can occur, which means the component of the theory that addresses discontinuities must play a greater role. Given the flatter structures associated with n-ary branching, certain phenomena (e.g. [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] and [[shifting (syntax)|shifting]]) do not result in discontinuities, a fact that reduces the role that the component for discontinuities must play in the theory.

==Tendencies==
As stated above, the main branching trait for a language is just a tendency and it often shows exceptions. [[Spanish language|Spanish]], for example, while overwhelmingly right-branching, puts numeral modifiers before nouns and, in certain cases, objects before verbs. Languages like English or Swedish, though regarded as being right-branching because the main verbs precede direct objects, place adjectives and numerals before their nouns. [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and most other languages of northeastern Asia and the [[Indian subcontinent]], on the other hand, are practically a model for rigidly left-branching languages. The [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]] and [[Austronesian languages]] of southeast Asia and many [[African languages]] come close to rigidly right-branching, with numerals as well as adjectives following their nouns and with degree words like ''very'', ''too'', ''extremely'', and ''quite'' following the adjectives they modify.

[[ File:William Bruges Garter King of Arms.jpg|thumb|200px|William Bruges dressed as Garter King of Arms, kneels before St George, from his Garter Book]]
The '''Bruges Garter Book''' is a 15th-century illuminated manuscript containing portraits of the founder knights of the [[Order of the Garter]]. It was made to the order of [[William Bruges]] (c. 1375-1450),  [[Garter King of Arms]], and constitutes the first [[Roll of arms|armorial]] covering members of the Order. It has been held since 1883 by the [[British Library]] (formerly the British Museum Library) in London under catalogue reference [[Stowe manuscripts|Stowe]] 594, indicating its former existence within the Library of the Dukes of Buckingham at [[Stowe House]].

==Origin==
It was made between about 1430 to 1440, probably in London.

==Description==
The cover is from after 1600, of brown leather tooled in gold-leaf with a floriated pattern, measuring 385 * 285 mm. The text is in Latin, written in a gothic and gothic cursive hand. It contains 27 full page miniatures in pen and watercolour, of which 26 depict  standing knights  displaying on a panel sitting on the ground to their right hand sides the  [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|heraldic escutcheons]] appertaining to their successors in the same Garter stall in  [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]]. The remaining page depicts William Bruges himself in the dress of Garter King of Arms kneeling before St George, the patron of the Order. 

The pages have been removed from their original positions and now exist mounted on  modern paper leaves. 
*Folios 1–3 consist of subsequently made notes.
*Folio 4 is a printed page imported from another book

==Provenance==
[[Image:Arms of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.svg|thumb|200px|Emblem of the Order of the Garter, a [[cross]] of St George within a Garter inscribed: ''Honi soit qui mal y pense''. It is shown embroidered onto the left shoulder of the Garter Robes of each of the knights depicted in the Bruges Garter Book, over a tunic or [[tabard]] bearing his own armorials]]
The manuscript is now held by the [[British Library]] in London. From William Bruges the manuscript passed successively to the ownerships of:
*John Writhe (d. 1504), herald.
*Sir [[Thomas Wriothesley]] (d. 1534), herald.
*Elias Ashmole (1617–1692) from 1665
*John Anstis (1669–1744)
*William Bayntun (d. 1785): inscription (f. 1): bought by Meyrick for 10 guineas.
*John Meyrick (d. 1805)
*John Towneley (d. 1816), whose bookplate is affixed on the inside upper cover.
*[[Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos]] (1776–1839), purchased from  Towneley in  May 1816. Kept in the library of [[Stowe House]].
*[[Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos]] (1797–1861), who sold it in 1849 to Lord Ashburnham. 
*[[Bertram Ashburnham, 4th Earl of Ashburnham]] (1797–1878)
*[[Bertram Ashburnham, 5th Earl of Ashburnham]] (1840–1913), who sold it in 1883 to the British Museum with another 1,084 former Stowe manuscripts.

The '''Burmese Declaration of Independence''' ({{lang-my|လွတ်လပ်ရေးကြေညာစာတမ်း}}) was officially promulgated on 4 January 1948, marking the end of British rule in Burma (now Myanmar). The date is now celebrated as [[Independence Day (Myanmar)|Independence Day]], a national gazetted holiday. The document was jointly penned by [[Thein Han]], [[Min Thu Wun]], [[Ohn Pe]] and Win Sein, and translated into English by [[Maung Maung]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Dr Maung Maung|last=Taylor|first=Robert H.|date=2003-08-01|publisher=Flipside Digital Content Company Inc.|year=|isbn=9789814515863|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[U Thant]], Khin Maung, and Khin Zaw.

== History ==
The Declaration of Independence was preceded by another Declaration of Independence, signed by [[Ba Maw]] on 1 August 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drbamawlibrary.org/documents-statements.asp|title=Dr. Ba Maw Library - Statements|website=www.drbamawlibrary.org|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], the Japanese government advanced its previously vague promise to grant Burma independence after the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Toland (author)|John Toland]], ''[[The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936-1945]]'' p 456 Random House New York 1970&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese felt that this would give the Burmese a real stake in an [[Axis Powers|Axis]] victory in the [[Second World War]], creating resistance against possible re-colonization by the western powers, and increased military and economic support from Burma for the Japanese war effort. A Burma Independence Preparatory Committee chaired by Ba Maw was formed 8 May 1943 and the nominally independent [[State of Burma]] was proclaimed on 1 August 1943 with Ba Maw as "Naingandaw Adipadi" ([[head of state]]) as well as prime minister.

BBC News, 2 December 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It was run by [[Unit 504]].&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt; The existence of the prison was unknown to the public before 2003, and most information about it remains classified, though Israel's supreme court ordered the release of some information about the jail.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

==Location==

Camp 1391 is situated in a [[Tegart fort]] on route 574 between kibbutz [[Barkai]] and kibbutz [[Ma'anit]] in northern Israel&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; and less than an hour's drive from Tel Aviv.&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt; 

===Discovery of the location===
The location of the camp was accidentally discovered by Israeli historian Gad Kroizer, who found a 70-year-old map drawn by a government architect while researching old [[United Kingdom|British]] police buildings. On the map were 62 British [[police]] compounds in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the late 1930s and early 1940s where [[Arab]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] militants against the British occupation were interrogated. One camp, "Meretz", did not appear on any modern Israeli maps. In 2004, Kroizer published an article in an academic journal, mentioning the prison location in a footnote. Some days later he received a phone call from Israel's military censor asking why the article had not been submitted for inspection.&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/54121 ''Secrets of Unit 1391: Uncovering an Israeli jail that specializes in nightmares''], Newsweek, 27 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', the facility "had been airbrushed from Israeli aerial photographs and purged from modern maps."&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,1084796,00.html ''Facility 1391: Israel's Secret Prison''], Chris McGreal, The Guardian, 14 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Camp 1391 was operated by the Israel Defense Forces [[Intelligence Corps (Israel)|Intelligence Corps]], rather than by [[Shin Bet]].&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;

According to accounts of former captives, the detainees were led into the facility blindfolded, and kept in cells (most are 2 &amp;nbsp;m × 2&amp;nbsp;m) with no natural light. Two smaller cells (1.25&amp;nbsp;m × 1.25&amp;nbsp;m) with heavy steel doors and black or red walls, and almost no light, were used for solitary confinement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6581">This article provides a '''Comparison of popular optical data-storage systems.'''

As of 2007 these are:
:* [[Compact Disc]] ("CD")
:* [[DVD]] (three variants: [[DVD+R]] and [[DVD-R]], both rather similar, and [[DVD-RAM]])

and their successors (formerly engaged in a [[format war]]):&lt;!-- REVISION NEEDED. Blu-ray has unofficially become the winner --&gt;
:* [[Blu-ray Disc]] (Official optical disk successor)[https://web.archive.org/web/20110614034031/http://www.redding.com/news/2008/feb/19/blu-ray-wins-format-war/]
:* [[HD DVD]] (Supported but no longer in production)[http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2008_02/pr1903.htm]

==Overview==

===Nomenclature===
In optical storage, three types of storage are usually recognized, and given customary abbreviations: read-only ("ROM"), Write once ("R") and read/writable ("RW", or for Blu-ray, "E" for "erasable"). Examples:
:* CD-ROM represents the CD format, in its pre-recorded "read only" use
:* DVD+R represents a DVD "+" disc which can be written once only
:* DVD-RW represents a DVD "-" disc which can be read or written many times
:* BR-E represents a Blu-ray disc which can be read or written many times.
In addition some of these media support [[MultiLevel Recording]] formats, for example dual layer (written as "DL"), and DVD also supports a "RAM" version (similar to RW), although this is not widely used in the popular consumer market.

===Coverage===
DVD has three variants, known as "+", "-" and "RAM". For the purposes of this article, DVD+ and DVD- are considered together as "DVD"; they share many of the same characteristics. Differences are noted below.

DVD-RAM, which did not gain wide penetration of the consumer market, is discussed briefly in the same section but otherwise excluded from the article.

ROM formats are excluded; they perform rather like write-once "R" formats, without the capacity to write to the disc. Likewise other niche formats are excluded, such as [[GD-ROM]] (used by some [[Sega]] [[game console]]s) and [[Ultra Density Optical]] and the like (commercial archiving storage rather than mass market).

Thus the article covers the following popular recordable formats: CD ([[CD-R]], [[CD-RW]]); DVD ([[DVD±R]], [[DVD±RW]]); HD DVD (); Blu-ray ([[BD-R]], [[BD-E]]), and for all except CD, their respective dual- or multi-layer formats.

== History ==
{{main|History of optical storage media}}
Although research into [[optical data storage]] has been ongoing for many decades, the first popular system was [[Compact Disc|CD]], introduced in 1982, adapted from audio ([[CD-DA]]) to data storage (the [[CD-ROM]] format) with the 1985 ''Yellow Book'', and re-adapted as the first mass market optical storage medium with [[CD-R]] and [[CD-RW]] in 1988. Compact Disc is still the [[de facto standard|''de facto'' standard]] for audio recordings, although its place for other multimedia recordings and optical data storage has largely been superseded by [[DVD]].

[[DVD]] (initially an [[acronym]] of "Digital Video Disc", then [[backronym]]ed as "Digital Versatile Disc" and officially just "DVD") was the mass market successor to CD. DVD was rolled out in 1996, again initially for video and audio. [[DVD recordable]] formats developed some time later: [[DRD-]] in late 1997 and [[DVD+]] in 2002. Although DVD was initially intended to prevent a [[format war]] in fact one did arise between these two formats. It was resolved with both surviving however: DVD-R predominating for stand-alone DVD recorders and players, and (for computers) most DVD devices being engineered as [[dual format]], to be compatible with both. As of 2007 DVD is the ''de facto'' standard for pre-recorded movies, and popular storage of data beyond the capacity of CD.

With the development of [[high definition television]], and the popularization of [[broadband]] and digital storage of movies, a further format development took place, again giving rise to two camps: [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]], based upon a switch from red to blue-violet laser and tighter engineering tolerances. As of 2007 both have significant releases in the pre-recorded movie sector, but they are still only commencing their roll-out for data storage and more general use, and have as yet made little impact on the global market for data storage. The result of this format war is not yet determined.

==Technology comparisons==

===Speed===
Optical device speeds are often quoted as a multiple of a "basic speed" for that type of device. Thus for CD, the basic speed is 150 [[kilobyte|kB]]/s, so a CD-recordable device may be quoted as "4x" or "6x" to indicate a speed of 600 kB/s and 900 kB/s respectively.

Typical values are:

===Optical storage devices excluded from article===
The following are examples of optical storage media excluded from this article:

:* [[Holographic data storage]] - either still in development, or available but generally only encountered in niche usage as of 2007.

:* [[Laserdisc]] - not used for recordable data storage in the computing world.

:* [[Optical jukebox]] - hold massive amounts of data on multiple discs allowing scalability into the petabyte range.

This article lists different types of [[pump]] and provides a comparison of certain key design features. Different types of pumps are suitable for different applications, for example: a pump's maximum lift height also determines the applications it can be used for. Low-lift pumps are only suitable for the pumping of surface water (e.g., irrigation, drainage of lands, ...), while high-lift pumps allow deep water pumping (e.g., potable water pumping from wells).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ah810e/AH810E05.htm Table of pumps; classification and characteristics]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Durban's Water Wonderland (Pty) Ltd v Botha'''''&lt;ref&gt;1999 (1) SA 982 (SCA).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African contract law]], especially in the area of [[exemption clause]]s. It was heard in the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]] on 16 November 1998, with judgment handed down on 27 November. The judges were Van Heerden DCJ, Howie JA, Harms JA, Scott JA and Melunsky AJA. PJ Olsen appeared as counsel for the appellant, and P. Ellis for the respondents.

== Facts ==
A mother and her two-and-a-half-year-old daughter were on a ride at an [[amusement park]] when something malfunctioned in the [[hydraulics]], throwing them off the ride. They sued for damages.

Durban's Water Wonderland found its defence in contract, claiming an exemption clause attached to the ticket. This clause was also displayed clearly on the window of the ticket office. As there was no ambiguity in the scope of the exemption, and as Botha saw it, the exemption clause applied.

The '''''Encarta Webster's Dictionary of the English Language''''' (2004) is the second edition of  the ''[[Encarta]] World English Dictionary'', published in 1999 (Anne Soukhanov, editor).  Slightly larger than a [[college dictionary]], it is similar in appearance and scope to the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'', which Soukhanov previously edited.  Created using the Bloomsbury dictionary database, it draws on English as it is spoken in all parts of the English-speaking world.  

A distinctive feature of the dictionary is the abbreviated definitions, highlighted prior to the full definition, for a quick glance meaning or to identify the sense being sought.

The Encarta name is also used for the abbreviated college dictionary editions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6272">[[File:Artis Volharding 2.jpg|thumb|The Ethnographisch Museum Artis was housed in the Volharding building at Artis.]]
'''Ethnographic Museum Artis''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: '''Ethnographisch Museum Artis''') was an [[ethnography|ethnographic]] [[museum]] in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. It was situated at the [[Natura Artis Magistra|Artis]] zoo.

==History==
The Amsterdam zoo and ethnographic museum were founded in 1838 by the Royal Zoological Society 'Natura Artis Magistra' (NAM).&lt;ref name="Dieserud1908"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dieserud|first=Juul|title=The scope and content of the science of anthropology: historical review, library classification and select, annotated bibliography; with a list of the chief publications of leading anthropological societies and museums|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcISAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA193|accessdate=26 October 2012|edition=Public domain|year=1908|publisher=The Open Court Publishing Co.|pages=193–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society focused on science in general and on presentation of the Dutch colonial territories in particular. Therefore, not only live exotic animals collected, but also many other zoological material (skeletons and preparations), minerals and ethnographic objects. These collections were housed since 1851 in a [[Zoological Museum Amsterdam|Natural History Museum]], also called the "Great Museum". It soon grew out of the building and the collections of ethnographic objects were separated from the rest and housed in the nearby building of the 'Society Amicitiae', the 'Little Museum". Eventually, the growing ethnographic collection could no longer be housed at the Society Amicitiae building, and in 1888, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the zoo, the ethnographic museum was established in the ''Volharding'' ("perseverance") building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.izn.org.uk/Archive/319/Izn-319.htm|title=Contents|publisher=International Zoo News Vol. 49/6 (No. 319) September 2002|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The zoo's ethnographic collection stemmed from the desire to understand creation. The Ethnographisch Museum Artis was the third ethnological museum in the Netherlands. Although it was smaller than the [[Rijksmuseum]] and the [[Wereldmuseum]], it was not less important. The collection was gathered by individuals, including government officials from the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colonies]], missionaries, agents and travelers, but also by companies and scientific societies. Thus, it contained objects that were collected during early scientific expeditions in [[Dutch New Guinea]]. There were artifacts made by indigenous populations as well as models of Dutch factories in [[Java]].&lt;ref name="Kuklick2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuklick|first=Henrika|title=New History of Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aV7RRIQNZsgC&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=26 October 2012|date=9 February 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76621-7|pages=178–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Material of the [[Internationale Koloniale en Uitvoerhandel Tentoonstelling|World Exhibition of 1883]], which was held in [[Amsterdam]], led to a visit to Artis. Eventually, the museum possessed not only pieces from the Dutch overseas territories, but also from [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Africa]], and [[Oceania]]. While the 19th century Korean objects illustrated human cultural diversity, the gendered collection of jackets, belts, slippers, hats and women's underwear was considered incomplete by today's standards.&lt;ref name="Wieringa2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wieringa|first=Saskia|title=Traveling Heritages: New Perspecitves on Collecting, Preserving, and Sharing Women's History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7hPoTVrLJkC&amp;pg=PA56|accessdate=26 October 2012|year=2008|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-5260-299-8|pages=56–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, the Ethnographic Museum Artis existed until 1910. ''Volharding'' became too small to house the many thousands of objects and it became outdated. The entire collection was donated to the Vereeniging Koloniaal Institute, who had a Colonial Museum in Amsterdam near Artis. That Colonial Museum became [[Tropenmuseum]]. It took over the collection in 1926. Of the original over 11,000 objects from the Artis collection, a large number decayed, but what remained still represents one of the core collections of the Tropenmuseum. A significant number are permanently exhibited.

==People==
A major donor was the linguist [[Herman Neubronner van der Tuuk]]. From 1887 to 1902, the collection was managed by curator [[Cornelis Marinus Pleyte]], who wrote a guide.&lt;ref name="Willink2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Willink|first=Robert Joost|title=Stages in Civilisation: Dutch Museums in Quest of West Central African Collections (1856-1889)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZlOI7PiHCEC&amp;pg=PA300|accessdate=28 October 2012|year=2007|publisher=CNWS Publications|isbn=978-90-5789-113-7|pages=300–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it was published by the Society Natura Artis Magistra, Pleyte and his father, the [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] [[Willem Pleyte]], went on to serve on the board of [[Brill Publishers]].&lt;ref name="Brill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brill.com/news/brill-calendar/brill-calendar-march/brill-calendar-march-28|title=A Brill Calendar: March 28|publisher=Brill|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computing]], '''floating point operations per second''' ('''FLOPS''', '''flops''' or '''flop/s''') is a measure of [[computer performance]], useful in fields of scientific computations that require [[floating-point]] calculations. For such cases it is a more accurate measure than measuring [[instructions per second]].

The similar term FLOP is often used for ''floating-point operation'', for example as a unit of counting floating-point operations carried out by an algorithm or computer hardware.

==Floating-point arithmetic==
[[Floating-point arithmetic]] is needed for very large or very small [[real number]]s, or computations that require a large dynamic range. Floating-point representation is similar to scientific notation, except everything is carried out in base two, rather than base ten. The encoding scheme stores the sign, the [[exponent]] (in base two for Cray and [[VAX]], base two or ten for [[IEEE floating point]] formats, and base 16 for [[IBM Floating Point Architecture]]) and the [[Significand]] (number after the radix point). While several similar formats are in use, the most common is [[IEEE 754-1985|ANSI/IEEE Std. 754-1985]]. This standard defines the format for 32-bit numbers called ''single precision'', as well as 64-bit numbers called ''double precision'' and longer numbers called ''extended precision'' (used for intermediate results). Floating-point representations can support a much wider range of values than fixed-point, with the ability to represent very small numbers and very large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dspguide.com/ch4/3.htm Floating Point] Retrieved on December 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamic range and precision===
The exponentiation inherent in floating-point computation assures a much larger dynamic range – the largest and smallest numbers that can be represented – which is especially important when processing data sets which are extremely large or where the range may be unpredictable. As such, floating-point processors are ideally suited for computationally intensive applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.analog.com/en/embedded-processing-dsp/content/Fixed-Point_vs_Floating-Point_DSP/fca.html Summary: Fixed-point (integer) vs floating-point] Retrieved on December 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational performance===
FLOPS and [[Million instructions per second#Million instructions per second|MIPS]] are units of measure for the numerical computing performance of a computer. Floating-point operations are typically used in fields such as scientific computational research. The unit MIPS measures integer performance of a computer. Examples of integer operation include data movement (A to B) or value testing (If A = B, then C). MIPS as a performance benchmark is adequate when a computer is used in database queries, word processing, spreadsheets, or to run multiple virtual operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dspguide.com/ch28/4.htm Fixed versus floating point.] Retrieved on December 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dspguide.com/ch28/1.htm Data manipulation and math calculation.] Retrieved on December 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Frank H. McMahon, of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, invented the terms FLOPS and MFLOPS (megaFLOPS) so that he could compare the supercomputers of the day by the number of floating-point calculations they performed per second. This was much better than using the prevalent MIPS to compare computers as this statistic usually had little bearing on the arithmetic capability of the machine.

FLOPS can be calculated using this equation:&lt;ref name="en.community.dell.com"&gt;[http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/high-performance-computing/w/wiki/2329.aspx "Nodes, Sockets, Cores and FLOPS, Oh, My" by Dr. Mark R. Fernandez, Ph.D.]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{FLOPS} = \text{sockets} \times \frac{\text{cores}}{\text{socket}} \times \frac{\text{cycles}}{ \text{second}} \times \frac{\text{FLOPs}}{\text{cycle}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Performance records==
===Single computer records===
In June 1997, [[Intel]]'s [[ASCI Red]] was the world's first computer to achieve one teraFLOPS and beyond. Sandia director Bill Camp said that ASCI Red had the best reliability of any supercomputer ever built, and "was supercomputing's high-water mark in longevity, price, and performance".&lt;ref name="jacobsequity.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sandia's ASCI Red, world's first teraflop supercomputer, is decommissioned |url=http://www.jacobsequity.com/ASCI%20Red%20Supercomputer.pdf |accessdate=November 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105131112/http://www.jacobsequity.com/ASCI%20Red%20Supercomputer.pdf |archivedate=November 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NEC]]'s [[NEC SX-9|SX-9]] supercomputer was the world's first [[vector processor]] to exceed 100&amp;nbsp;gigaFLOPS per single core.

For comparison, a [[calculator|handheld calculator]] performs relatively few FLOPS. A computer response time below 0.1&amp;nbsp;second in a calculation context is usually perceived as instantaneous by a human operator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.useit.com/papers/responsetime.html |title=Response Times: The Three Important Limits |accessdate=June 11, 2008 |publisher=Jakob Nielsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; so a simple calculator needs only about 10&amp;nbsp;FLOPS to be considered functional.

In June 2006, a new computer was announced by Japanese research institute [[RIKEN]], the [[MDGRAPE-3]]. The computer's performance tops out at one petaFLOPS, almost two times faster than the Blue Gene/L, but MDGRAPE-3 is not a general purpose computer, which is why it does not appear in the [[TOP500|Top500.org]] list. It has special-purpose [[pipeline (computing)|pipelines]] for simulating molecular dynamics.

By 2007, [[Intel|Intel Corporation]] unveiled the experimental [[multi-core]] [[Teraflops Research Chip|POLARIS]] chip, which achieves 1 teraFLOPS at 3.13&amp;nbsp;GHz. The 80-core chip can raise this result to 2 teraFLOPS at 6.26&amp;nbsp;GHz, although the thermal dissipation at this frequency exceeds 190&amp;nbsp;watts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Swinburne |url=http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/2007/04/30/the_arrival_of_teraflop_computing/2 |title=The Arrival of TeraFLOP Computing |publisher=bit-tech.net |date=April 30, 2007 |accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2007, [[IBM]] announced the second generation of its top supercomputer, dubbed Blue Gene/P and designed to continuously operate at speeds exceeding one petaFLOPS. When configured to do so, it can reach speeds in excess of three petaFLOPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.top500.org/lists/2008/06|title=June 2008|publisher=TOP500|accessdate=July 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, Top500.org reported the fastest computer in the world to be the [[Blue Gene|IBM Blue Gene/L]] supercomputer, measuring a peak of 596&amp;nbsp;teraFLOPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://top500.org/news/2007/06/23/29th_top500_list_world_s_fastest_supercomputers_released |title=29th TOP500 List of World's Fastest Supercomputers Released |date=June 23, 2007 |publisher=Top500.org |accessdate=July 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509064814/http://www.top500.org/news/2007/06/23/29th_top500_list_world_s_fastest_supercomputers_released |archivedate=May 9, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cray XT4]] hit second place with 101.7&amp;nbsp;teraFLOPS.

On October 25, 2007, [[NEC]] Corporation of Japan issued a press release announcing its SX series model [[SX-9]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nec.co.jp/press/en/0710/2501.html|title=NEC Launches World's Fastest Vector Supercomputer, SX-9|date=October 25, 2007|publisher=NEC|accessdate=July 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming it to be the world's fastest vector supercomputer. The [[SX-9]] features the first CPU capable of a peak vector performance of 102.4 gigaFLOPS per single core.

On February 4, 2008, the [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] and the [[University of Texas at Austin]] opened full scale research runs on an [[AMD]], [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] supercomputer named [[Texas Advanced Computing Center#Ranger|Ranger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

the most powerful supercomputing system in the world for open science research, which operates at sustained speed of 0.5&amp;nbsp;petaFLOPS.

On May 25, 2008, an American supercomputer built by [[IBM]], named '[[IBM Roadrunner|Roadrunner]]', reached the computing milestone of one petaFLOPS. It headed the June 2008 and November 2008 [[TOP500]] list of the most powerful supercomputers (excluding [[grid computing|grid computers]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;taxonomyName=hardware&amp;articleId=9095318&amp;taxonomyId=12&amp;intsrc=kc_top |title=IBM's Roadrunner smashes 4-minute mile of supercomputing |accessdate=June 10, 2008 |author=Sharon Gaudin |date=June 9, 2008 |publisher=Computerworld |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224001155/http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;taxonomyName=hardware&amp;articleId=9095318&amp;taxonomyId=12&amp;intsrc=kc_top |archivedate=December 24, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.top500.org/lists/2008/11/press-release |title=Austin ISC08 |publisher=Top500.org |date=November 14, 2008 |accessdate=February 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222023827/http://www.top500.org/lists/2008/11/press-release |archivedate=February 22, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The computer is located at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.

In June 2008, AMD released ATI Radeon HD 4800 series, which are reported to be the first GPUs to achieve one teraFLOPS. On August 12, 2008, AMD released the ATI Radeon HD 4870X2 graphics card with two [[Radeon HD 4000 series|Radeon R770]] GPUs totaling 2.4 teraFLOPS.

In November 2008, an upgrade to the Cray XT Jaguar supercomputer at the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) raised the system's computing power to a peak 1.64 petaFLOPS, making Jaguar the world's first petaFLOPS system dedicated to open research. In early 2009 the supercomputer was named after a mythical creature, [[Kraken]]. Kraken was declared the world's fastest university-managed supercomputer and sixth fastest overall in the 2009 TOP500 list. In 2010 Kraken was upgraded and can operate faster and is more powerful.

In 2009, the [[Cray]] Jaguar performed at 1.75 petaFLOPS, beating the IBM Roadrunner for the number one spot on the TOP500 list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/11/15/supercomputer-ibm-jaguar-technology-cio-network-cray.html?feed=rss_popstories | work=Forbes | first=Andy | last=Greenberg | title=Cray Dethrones IBM In Supercomputing | date=November 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fields Virology''''' is an [[English language|English-language]] [[virology]] [[textbook]], published in two volumes, originally edited by [[Bernard N. Fields]]. The first edition in 1985 was called '''''Virology''''', but the book's title was changed from the second edition to ''Fields Virology''. The book is widely regarded as an influential work on the subject and is cited as the ''bible of virology'' by many virologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sgm.ac.uk/pubs/micro_today/book_reviews/MTNOV07/MTN07_01.cfm |title=Microbiology Today: Book Reviews: Fields Virology |author=Ulrich Desselberger |date= |work= |publisher=[[Society for General Microbiology]] |accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fields was the senior editor for the first three editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=In memoriam Bernard Nathan Fields |author=Anon. |journal=[[Archives of Virology]] |volume=140 |pages=983–85|year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death in 1995, subsequent editions have retained his name in the title. The 6th edition came out in 2013, edited by [[David M. Knipe]] and [[Peter Howley]], and published by [[Wolters Kluwer]] under the [[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]] imprint.

'''Flags of the World''' (abbreviated '''FOTW''' or '''FotW''') is an [[Internet]]-based [[vexillological]] association and resource. Its principal project is the Internet's largest website devoted to [[vexillology]], containing comprehensive information about all kinds of [[flag]]s,&lt;ref name="fm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fiav.org/current-members/ |title=Current Members |website=Fédération Internationale des Associations Vexillologiques |year=2016 |accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an associated [[Electronic mailing list|mailing list]]. The mailing list began as a discussion group in about September 1993, while the website was founded by Giuseppe Bottasini in late 1994, and Rob Raeside took over as director in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/fotwhist.html |title=History of FOTW |website=Flags of the World |year=2015 |accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flags of the World became the 56th member of the [[International Federation of Vexillological Associations|FIAV]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="fm" /&gt; 

Flags of the World describes itself as "...an Internet group, the sole purpose of which is the advancement of the pursuit of vexillology, that is the creation and development of a body of knowledge about flags and flag usage of all types".&lt;ref&gt;''Flags of the World'' mailing list rules, Part 4, Article 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the website and the mailing list operate in the [[English language]],&lt;ref name="fm" /&gt; though there are members from around the world and as such information from many languages is translated and included. The mailing list is monitored by the FOTW Listmaster, while work on the website is coordinated by the FOTW Editorial Director.

== Website ==
An editorial staff of 21 unpaid volunteers&lt;ref name="FOTW Editorial Staff"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flagspot.net/flags/edistaff.html |title=FOTW Editorial Staff |website=Flags of the World |accessdate=12 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; manages and edits the FOTW website, which (as of 2013) contains more than 53,000 pages about flags and more than 102,000 images of flags,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flagspot.net/flags/ |title=Welcome to Flags of the World |website=Flags of the World |accessdate=12 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also includes an extensive online dictionary of [[vexillology]].   

The website is updated once a week with fresh material; some [[mirror website|mirrors]] update monthly. Due to the high amount of material there is an editing backlog, causing some areas of FOTW to contain outdated information. There are also some mirrors that have not been updated for varying periods of time and which are therefore considered "historical".

== Mailing list ==
The source for material on the FOTW website are contributions to the FOTW mailing list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/flags/ |title=FOTW mailing list |website=Yahoo! Groups}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has over 1,000 members, of which some 100 are active contributors. The mailing list has notable minorities of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and [[Russian language|Russian]] speakers. A staff of three unpaid volunteers&lt;ref name="FOTW Editorial Staff"/&gt; manages and moderates the list.

== Social media ==
An affiliated Flags of the World [[Facebook]] group has been established, inaugurated by Edward Mooney, Jr. 

{{as of|October 2018}} the group is run and moderated by a team of ten administrators, and has over 12,000 members throughout the world.

== Graphical conventions ==
[[File:Color guide flags.svg|right|200px|thumb|FOTW Color Palette.]]
FOTW displays standardized flag images in [[GIF]] format, usually at a height of 216 pixels. While the GIF file format is capable of displaying 256 colours, the site's standard calls for a more restricted "FOTW palette" of 32 colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://flagspot.net/flags/fotwcols.html |title=FOTW colour guide |website=Flags of the World |year=2015 |accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flag ==
The organization's flag is a design by Mark Sensen, which was selected over 10 challengers in a poll of FOTW mailing list members and was adopted 8 March 1996. Since then, March 8 has been regarded as FOTW's [[Flag day]]. Sensen described its symbolism:

{{quote|text=White on the hoist stands for peace, blue on the fly for progress. The six colours of the stars are the main colours used in flags. The stars help to make one bigger symbol. The way the stars are all connected to each other represents the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flagspot.net/flags/fotwprfl.html |title=FOTW Official Flag |website=Flags of the World |accessdate=19 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The flag is thus used as a rare representation of the [[Internet]] on a flag.

'''Jack Barton Adkisson Sr.''' (August 16, 1929 – September 10, 1997) was an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]  known more under the [[ring name]] '''Fritz Von Erich''', better known today as a wrestling promoter and the patriarch of the [[Von Erich family]]. He was also the owner of the [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] territory.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.129)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football career==
Adkisson attended [[Southern Methodist University]], where he threw discus and played football.  He has been reported to have played with the now defunct [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]] of the [[NFL]] (not the [[American Football League|AFL]] team which became the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/2010/01/today-in-texas-history-texas-gets-its-first-nfl-team/ |title=Today in Texas History: Texas gets its first NFL team|author=Dunham, Richard|accessdate=2014-07-09|date=January 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/players|quote=search historical players, Jack Adkisson|title=NFL PLAYERS}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was signed as a guard but was cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hornbaker, Tim|title=National Wrestling Alliance: The Untold Story of the Monopoly That Strangled Pro Wrestling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npQBhSTtvCsC&amp;pg=PT267&amp;lpg=PT267&amp;dq=jack+adkisson+jewett&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_icTu9lI3e&amp;sig=Jwgyx5NUtGRCzifLDu6Ca-R4uHQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xlCUVIOtLMWbyATs1YLYCQ&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=jack%20adkisson%20jewett&amp;f=false|year=2007|publisher=ECW Press|page=242|isbn=978-1-55022-741-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then tried the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL).

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career and training===
While in [[Edmonton]], he met legendary wrestler and trainer [[Stu Hart]], and Hart decided to train and book him in his Klondike Wrestling promotion, naming him Fritz Von Erich and teaming him with "brother" [[Waldo Von Erich]] as a pair "evil German" brothers. Adkisson's oldest son Jack Barton Adkisson Jr. was born September 21, 1952. He died in 1959, however, after an accidental [[Electric shock|electrocution]] and [[drowning]], and Jack Sr. stopped traveling to the east coast, allowing former partner Waldo to use the Von Erich name in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wide Wrestling Federation]].

===1960s===
Despite Jack Jr.'s death, Adkisson continued to travel and wrestle. Adkisson won both versions of the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship|AWA World title]] in 1963. His major circuit was [[Sam Muchnick]]'s [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]] territorial [[St. Louis Wrestling Club|stronghold]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. He wrestled there until 1967, when he voluntarily left the territory after losing a match for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] against then-champion [[Gene Kiniski]].&lt;ref name="WON 1/9/08"&gt;Dave Meltzer, [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]], January 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1960s, with Muchnick's backing, Adkisson became the promoter for the [[Dallas]] territory, effectively overseeing the [[Houston]] and [[San Antonio]] territories, as well.&lt;ref name="WON 1/9/08"/&gt;

===Japan===
Adkisson was a part of rebuilding [[Professional wrestling in Japan|Japanese wrestling]] after the stabbing death of [[Rikidōzan]]. He became a star due to his feuds with [[Antonio Inoki]] and [[Shohei Baba|Giant Baba]], and his "Iron Claw" hold, which became one of the most popular wrestling moves in Japan.

===Retirement===
In 1982, he held his first retirement match against [[King Kong Bundy]] in the newly renamed [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] promotion, based in Dallas. The promotion was known for its high production values, use of entrance music and the use of [[television syndication]]. The promotion was one of the most successful territories in the United States, with major draws like his sons, [[The Fabulous Freebirds]], [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|Chris Adams]], [[Abdullah the Butcher]], [[Bruiser Brody]], [[Gino Hernandez]] and [[Rick Rude]]. By the end of the 1980s, the promotion's talent pool was thin and it was eventually merged with [[Jerry Jarrett]]'s [[Continental Wrestling Association]] to create the [[United States Wrestling Association]] in 1989.

==Personal life and death==
{{See also|Von Erich family}}
Adkisson married Doris J. Smith on June 23, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/31992?c=search&amp;first=jack&amp;last=adkisson Texas Divorces]&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they had six sons: Jack Barton Jr. (September 21, 1952 - March 7, 1959), [[Kevin Von Erich|Kevin]] (born May 15, 1957), [[David Von Erich|David]] (July 22, 1958 - February 10, 1984), [[Kerry Von Erich|Kerry]] (February 3, 1960 – February 18, 1993), [[Mike Von Erich|Mike]] (March 2, 1964 – April 12, 1987) and [[Chris Von Erich|Chris]] (September 30, 1969 – September 12, 1991). Of Adkisson's six sons, only Kevin is still living. The couple later separated and Doris divorced her husband on July 21, 1992 after 42 years of marriage.

Adkisson died of brain and lung cancer on September 10, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/sep11_fritz.html|title=Fritz Von Erich dead at 68|publisher=Slam! Sports|accessdate=2007-05-30|date=1997-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[funeral]] service was held at the First Baptist Church in [[Dallas, Texas]]. His body was cremated with his ashes interred in the same plot as his fourth son, Kerry.

'''Gerrit David Gratama''' (22 March 1874  &amp;ndash; 20 August 1965), was a Dutch artist, writer, and director of the [[Frans Hals Museum]].

==Biography==
He was born in Groningen and was the brother of the architect [[Jan Gratama]]. He studied at [[Royal Academy of Art, The Hague|the Hague Academy of art]] during the years 1892-1895, and afterwards during the years 1895-1897 he continued his studies at the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Royal academy of art in Antwerp]].&lt;ref name=Gratama&gt;Obituary of Hendrik van Borssum Buisman (1 January 1873 - 15 October 1951) in Jaarboek Haerlem 1951, by G.D. Gratama, pp. 31-32, De Erven F. Bohn N.V., Haerlem, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/33395 Gerrit David Gratama] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a pupil in Antwerp of [[Albrecht de Vriendt]] and [[Henri Heymans]] and a friend of [[Hendrik van Borssum Buisman]], [[Simon Maris]], [[Toon Dupuis]], [[Isidoor Opsomer]], [[Walter Vaes]] and H.J. Wouter.&lt;ref name=Gratama/&gt; In 1912 he was appointed director of the Frans Hals Museum, which meant that he oversaw the complete renovation of the former [[Oude Mannenhuis]] and the move of the collection from the upper floors of the [[City Hall (Haarlem)|City Hall]].&lt;ref name=Hees&gt;Obituary of Gerrit David Gratama (22 March 1874 - 21 August 1965) in Jaarboek Haerlem 1965, by Carla van Hees (C.A. de Goederen-van Hees), pp. 24-28, De Erven F. Bohn N.V., Haerlem, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Among his tasks were organizing exhibitions and keeping the museum catalog up-to-date, and for his 25th anniversary as director, he organized a Frans Hals monograph exhibition to celebrate the 75th birthday of the Haarlem municipal museum and wrote the Frans Hals Exhibition catalog in 1937 together with J.L.A.A.M. van Rijckevoorsel.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Commons:Frans Hals Exhibition catalog, 1937|Frans Hals Exhibition catalog, 1937]] on Commons&lt;/ref&gt;

He was hired not only as a curator and director, but was also artist-in-residence at the museum and kept a studio there. He was known for his portraits and still-life paintings.&lt;ref name=Hees/&gt; He retired officially in 1940, but was asked to stay on during the war and oversaw the storage of the collection highlights in the dunes. He did retire after 33 years in 1946, but he continued as a painter into old age.&lt;ref name=Hees/&gt; He was succeeded as director of the museum by [[Henricus Petrus Baard]].
He died in Haarlem.

In 2011 the Public Data Explorer was made available for anyone to upload, share and visualize data sets. To facilitate this, Google created a new data format, the Dataset Publishing Language (DSPL).  Once the data is imported, a dataset can be visualized, embedded in external websites, and shared with others like a [[Google Docs|Google Doc]].&lt;ref name="SEL2011"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sherman|first1=Chris|title=Visualize Your Own Information With Google Public Data Explorer|url=http://searchengineland.com/visualize-your-own-information-with-google-public-data-explorer-65081|publisher=Search Engine Land|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, this toolset was enhanced with the [https://www.google.com/analytics/360-suite/analytics/ Google Analytics Suite], particularly [https://www.google.com/analytics/360-suite/data-studio/ Data Studio 360], whose release [https://analytics.googleblog.com/2016/05/announcing-data-studio-our-free-new.html expanded to a free public beta in May 2016], which enabled import of public or individual datasets and overlaid user-friendly (non-coding) data visualization tools.

== SDMX conversion ==
The [[SDMX]] converter is an open source application, which offers the ability to convert DSPL (Google's Dataset Publishing Language) messages to SDMX-ML and backwards. The output file of a DSPL dataset is a zip file containing data ([[Comma-separated values|CSV]] files) and metadata ([[XML]] file). Datasets in this format can be processed by Google and visualized in the Google Public Data Explorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SDMX Converter|url=https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/sdmx/index.php/SDMX_Converter|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"HMS" ''Surprise''''' is a modern [[tall ship]] built at [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia|Lunenburg]], [[Nova Scotia]]. The vessel was built in 1970 as '''HMS ''Rose''''' to a [[Phil Bolger]] design based on the original 18th-century British [[Admiralty]] drawings of {{HMS|Rose|1757|6}}, a 20-gun [[sixth-rate]] [[post ship]] from 1757.

==As HMS ''Rose''==
The ship was meant to be a close replica of the original ''Rose'', but still fill a commercial function. John Fitzhugh Millar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Millar|first1=John F.|title=Building the Replicas of Revolutionary War Ships Rose and Providence|url=http://smallstatebighistory.com/building-replicas-revolutionary-war-ships-rose-providence/|website=smallstatebighistory.com|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Millar|first1=J. F.|title=John Fitzhugh Millar|url=http://www.newporthousebb.com/photo_album/page22/|website=newporthousebb.com|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who commissioned the ship build gave Bolger copies of the original British Admiralty drawings, Bolger modified the hull shape below the water line, sharpening up her entry so she sailed to windward better. Unlike some square-riggers, she could sail two points (22-1/2 degrees) on the wind provided that seas remained under four feet or so. Bolger also changed the arrangement of her decks, at the banks insistence, so that she could be used as a tavern and restaurant, though she was never used as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolger|first1=Philip C.|title=30-Odd Boats|date=1982|publisher=International Marine Publishing Company|isbn=0877421528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=HMS Rose Sails Soon|journal=Boating|issue=October 1969|page=85|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nHv-v3JYFgYC&amp;lpg=RA4-PA85&amp;ots=VM07Gf6m_y&amp;dq=phil%20bolger%20book%20AND%20HMS%20Rose&amp;pg=RA4-PA85#v=onepage&amp;q=phil%20bolger%20book%20AND%20HMS%20Rose&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rose'' was built at the [[Smith and Rhuland]] shipyard in Lunenburg, a yard which had established a reputation for large and successful replicas such as HMS {{ship||Bounty|1960 ship|2}} in 1960 and {{ship||Bluenose II}} in 1963.

The ship was inspected and certified by the [[United States Coast Guard]]. She spent the first ten years of her life in Newport, Rhode Island sailing in Newport Harbor and as a dockside attraction. In 1984, already in serious disrepair, she was purchased by Kaye Williams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Biebel|first1=Frederick|title=Path of a Patriot|date=2008|isbn=0615236650|page=186|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8sT2AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;ots=OYVRzkFl0h&amp;dq=hms%20rose%20replica&amp;pg=PA186#v=onepage&amp;q=hms%20rose%20replica&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and brought to Bridgeport, Connecticut, and operated as a [[sail training]] vessel in the 1980s and 1990s, run by the HMS Rose Foundation based in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]], [[United States]]. In her lifetime as ''Rose'', her figurehead had to be replaced twice, each time slightly upgraded. One was damaged in a storm off Bermuda on her way to [[Norfolk, Virginia]] in June 1998. The figurehead was named in fun as "Chester" by the crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nyden|first1=W. A.|title=Vacation June 1998|url=http://www.nyden.us/roserpt.html|website=nyden.us|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1972, ''Rose'' was hired for the film "''[[The Man Without a Country (1973 film)|The Man Without a Country]]''", a made-for-television production. Norman Rosemont Productions couldn't find the money to take the ship out sailing, so all the filming was shot with sails set, as the ship was securely moored to the pier, next to the causeway to [[Goat Island (Rhode Island)|Goat Island]]. During filming Cliff Robertson had to hide that he had a broken leg at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Millar|first1=John Fitzhugh|title=Building the Replicas of Revolutionary War Ships Rose and Providence|url=http://smallstatebighistory.com/building-replicas-revolutionary-war-ships-rose-providence/|website=smallstatebighistory|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the 1990s, the publisher W. W. Norton &amp; Company rented ''Rose'' in New York for a pier-side party to celebrate the publication of  [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s latest novel. O'Brian himself was present, and he casually mentioned to ''Rose''{{'}}s captain Richard Bailey that if ''Rose'' were painted in an 1805 colour scheme she would be a "dead ringer" for the frigate ''Surprise'' that appeared in his books. Bailey quickly ordered his crew to get out the paint and make the changes. O'Brian was so impressed that he changed his mind about his prohibition of having any of his books converted into film, and Norton immediately started looking for a Hollywood production company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Millar|first1=John Fitzhugh|title=Building the Replicas of Revolutionary War Ships Rose and Providence|url=http://smallstatebighistory.com/building-replicas-revolutionary-war-ships-rose-providence/|website=smallstatebighistory|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HMS Rose - 1971 under sail off Massachusetts.png|thumb|200px|right|Replica HMS ''Rose'' off Massachusetts in 1971, the hull painted as her namesake]]

==Transformation into HMS ''Surprise''==

The ship was sold to the [[20th Century Fox]] film studio in March 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cummings|first1=Bill|title=Goodbye, Rose: Filmmaker Pays $1.5m for Bridgeport Frigate|url=http://www.peterweircave.com/master/rose1.html|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and underwent extensive modifications to be used in the making of the film ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]'', in which she portrayed the [[Royal Navy]] frigate HMS {{HMS|Surprise|1796|2}} with a story based on several of the books by Patrick O'Brian. The modifications included a reshaped stern, all deck structures removed, the single ship's wheel replaced by a double wheel, period fighting tops fitted, new sails, and the figurehead replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quinlan|first1=Eric|title=Cross Currents|journal=Yachting|date=Nov 2003|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZPTPomKTxHsC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;ots=JdRea5AnXt&amp;dq=hms%20surprise%20extensive%20modifications&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q=hms%20surprise%20extensive%20modifications&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaming as HMS ''Surprise''==
After the film was complete, the ship was leased and then purchased by the [[Maritime Museum of San Diego]] which has restored her to sailing condition as of September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legacy.sname.org/sections/san_diego/Presentations/2007-10_Reviving_Surprise.pdf "Reviving Surprise"(pdf) David L. Kolthoff, P.E.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ship has officially been re-registered as "HMS ''Surprise''" in honor of her role in the film. She sails several times a year, often with the museum's other tall ships, the schooner {{ship||Californian|schooner|2}} and the 1863 barque {{ship||Star of India|ship|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdmaritime.com/contentpage.asp?ContentID=152 SDMM article on ''Surprise''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405203518/http://www.sdmaritime.com/ContentPage.asp?ContentID=152 |date=2005-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, she portrayed HMS ''Providence'' in the [[Disney]] [[adventure film]] ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://img835.imageshack.us/slideshow/webplayer.php?id=lb1f.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related facts==
Although she is known by the prefix '''HMS''', meaning Her (or His) [[Her Majesty's Ship|Majesty's Ship]], she is not, and had never been, [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] in the Royal Navy and therefore had no right to use this prefix.

In 1991, The [[Connecticut General Assembly]] passed "An Act Concerning the HMS Rose" in which the ship was commissioned as a vessel of the [[Connecticut Naval Militia]].  The act stated that the H.M.S. Rose Foundation was responsible for maintaining the ship, but when the ship was sold to 20th Century Fox, the statute was not repealed and is still in effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_504.htm#sec_27-5 CGS 27-5 - Public Act 91-31]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2056">'''''Hitzeroth v Brooks''''' is an important case in the [[South African]] law of lease, in which Hitzeroth instituted action for the ejectment of Brooks from certain property.  Her cause of action was founded upon an undisputed [[allegation]] that she was the owner of the property and Brooks was in [[Crime|unlawful]] occupation thereof.

Brooks alleged that she was the cessionary of a [[lease]] which had been entered into between Hitzeroth's late husband as lessor and one Mrs Rodkey as lessee for a period of nine years and eleven months. This lease gave the lessee the right to renew the lease for a further period subject to the same [[terms and conditions]].  Furthermore, the lessee had the right either to [[sublet]] or to [[cede]] her rights to any other period for the unexpired portion of the lease or renewal thereof.

Mrs Rodkey had ceded her rights to Brooks.

When Brooks gave Hitzeroth written notice of her intention to renew the lease, Hitzeroth challenged the validity of the renewal and subsequently brought this action.

O'Hagan J held that the words "[[Third-party beneficiary|third parties]]" in section 2 of the General Law Amendment Act of 1956 should be so construed as to exclude from the operation of the proviso persons falling within the class comprising gratuitous successors to the lessor: that is, persons who, under the previous statute and the common law, were bound by a long lease whether or not they had notice, actual or constructive, of the existence of the lease.

Munnik J held that the words "third parties" in the section refer to those who are not parties to the lease or cession, but persons other than the original contracting parties can become parties to it, in which case they are not "third parties" within the meaning of the section.

The '''Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers''' ('''ICANN''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|k|æ|n}} {{respell|EYE|kan}}) is a nonprofit organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several [[database]]s related to the [[namespace]]s and numerical spaces of the Internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation.&lt;ref name="ICANN Bylaws"/&gt; ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance work of the Central Internet Address pools and [[DNS root zone]] registries pursuant to the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) function contract. The contract regarding the IANA [[stewardship]] functions between ICANN and the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]] (NTIA) of the [[United States Department of Commerce]] ended on October 1, 2016, formally transitioning the functions to the global [[Multistakeholder governance model|multistakeholder community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icann.org/news/blog/cheers-to-the-multistakeholder-community|title=Cheers to the Multistakeholder Community|publisher=ICANN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icann.org/news/blog/final-implementation-update|title=Final Implementation Update|publisher=ICANN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2016-10-01-en|title=Stewardship of IANA Functions Transitions to Global Internet Community as Contract with U.S. Government Ends|publisher=ICANN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Assistant Secretary Strickling on IANA Functions Contract|url=https://www.ntia.doc.gov/press-release/2016/statement-assistant-secretary-strickling-iana-functions-contract|publisher=[[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of its work has concerned the Internet's global [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), including policy development for internationalization of the DNS system, introduction of new generic [[top-level domains]] (TLDs), and the operation of [[root name server]]s.  The numbering facilities ICANN manages include the [[Internet Protocol]] address spaces for [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]], and assignment of address blocks to [[Regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]]. ICANN also maintains registries of Internet Protocol identifiers.

ICANN's primary principles of operation have been described as helping preserve the operational stability of the Internet; to promote competition; to achieve broad representation of the global Internet community; and to develop policies appropriate to its mission through [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]], consensus-based processes.&lt;ref name="Memorandum of understanding between the U.S. Department of Commerce and Internet Corporation for assigned names and numbers"/&gt;

ICANN's creation was announced publicly on September 17, 1998 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Postel|first=Jonathan|title=A Brief Explanation of the Joint IANA and NSI Documents Defining the New Internet Corporation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990219132906/http://www.netsol.com:80/policy/icann/}}&lt;/ref&gt;,and it formally came into being on September 30, 1998, incorporated in the U.S. state of California.&lt;ref name="kepler.ss.ca.gov"/&gt; Originally headquartered in [[Marina del Rey]] in the same building as the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[Information Sciences Institute]] (ISI)], its offices are now in the [[Playa Vista, Los Angeles|Playa Vista]] neighborhood of Los Angeles.

==History==
Before the establishment of ICANN, the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] function of administering registries of Internet protocol identifiers (including the distributing top-level domains and IP addresses) was performed by [[Jon Postel]], a Computer Science researcher who had been involved in the creation of [[ARPANET]], first at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and then at USC-ISI.&lt;ref name="V. Cerf"&gt;{{cite ietf |rfc=2460 |title=I REMEMBER IANA |author=V. Cerf |date=October 17, 1998 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zittrain|first=Jonathan|title=No, Barack Obama Isn't Handing Control of the Internet Over to China|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/117093/us-withdraws-icann-why-its-no-big-deal|work=The New Republic|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 Postel testified before Congress that this had come about as a "side task" to this research work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/science/hsy268140.000/hsy268140_0.HTM|title=Internet Domain Names, Part I|publisher=[[United States House of Representatives]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Information Sciences Institute was funded by the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], as was SRI International's Network Information Center, which also performed some assigned name functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeNardis|first=Laura|title=Protocol Politics: The Globalization of Internet Governance|date=2009|isbn=978-0-262-04257-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Internet grew and expanded globally, the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]] initiated a process to establish a new organization to perform the IANA functions. On January 30, 1998, the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]] (NTIA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, issued for comment, "A Proposal to Improve the Technical Management of Internet Names and Addresses." The proposed rule making, or "Green Paper",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/domainname130.htm|title=Internet Domain Names|first=|last=NTIA/PTO|website=www.ntia.doc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in the Federal Register on February 20, 1998, providing opportunity for public comment. NTIA received more than 650 comments as of March 23, 1998, when the comment period closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Management of Internet Names and Addresses|url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/6_5_98dns.txt|publisher=Dept of Commerce/NTIA|accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Paper proposed certain actions designed to privatize the management of Internet names and addresses in a manner that allows for the development of competition and facilitates global participation in Internet management. The Green Paper proposed for discussion a variety of issues relating to [[Domain Name System|DNS]] management including private sector creation of a new not-for-profit corporation (the "new corporation") managed by a globally and functionally representative board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weil|first1=Nancy|title=New U.S. policy turns 'Net governance over to private sector|url=http://sunsite.uakom.sk/sunworldonline/swol-06-1998/swol-06-ntia.html|publisher=SunWorld|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICANN was formed in response to this policy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} ICANN managed the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) under contract to the [[United States Department of Commerce]] (DOC) and pursuant to an agreement with the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]].&lt;ref name="B.

ICANN was incorporated in California on September 30, 1998, with entrepreneur and philanthropist [[Esther Dyson]] as founding chairwoman.&lt;ref name="kepler.ss.ca.gov"/&gt; It is a nonprofit public benefit corporation "organized under the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law for charitable and public purposes."&lt;ref name="ArticlesICANN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Articles of Incorporation of Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers|url=https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/articles-2012-02-25-en|publisher=Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers|accessdate=February 17, 2017|location=Los Angeles|date=November 21, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICANN was established in California due to the presence of [[Jon Postel]], who was a founder of ICANN and was set to be its first [[Chief Technology Officer]] prior to his unexpected death. ICANN formerly operated from the same [[Marina del Rey, California|Marina del Rey]] building where Postel formerly worked, which is home to an office of the [[Information Sciences Institute]] at the [[University of Southern California]]. However, ICANN's headquarters is now located in the nearby [[Playa Vista, Los Angeles|Playa Vista]] neighborhood of [[Westside (Los Angeles County)|Los Angeles]].

Per its original [[by-law]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icann.org/en/about/governance/bylaws/bylaws-06nov98-en.htm#VI|title=ICANN|website=''icann.org''}}&lt;/ref&gt; primary responsibility for policy formation in ICANN was to be delegated to three supporting organizations (Address Supporting Organization, Domain Name Supporting Organization, and Protocol Supporting Organization), each of which was to develop and recommend substantive policies and procedures for the management of the identifiers within their respective scope. They were also required to be financially independent from ICANN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Summary of DNS/ICANN Issues|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/pressbriefings/icann/briefingbook/executivesummaries.html#SOs|publisher=Berkman Center|accessdate=February 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As expected, the [[Regional Internet Registries]] and the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] agreed to serve as the Address Supporting Organization and Protocol Supporting Organization respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Santiago Resolutions|url=https://archive.icann.org/en/meetings/santiago/santiago-resolutions.htm|work=ICANN Board Resolutions|publisher=ICANN|accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Summary of DNS/ICANN Now, ICANN policy is being set by ambiguous so-called Communities.

On July 26, 2006, the United States government renewed the contract with ICANN for performance of the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] function for an additional one to five years.&lt;ref name="United States cedes control of the Internet - but what now?"/&gt; The context of ICANN's relationship with the U.S. government was clarified on September 29, 2006 when ICANN signed a new [[Memorandum of Understanding]] with the [[United States Department of Commerce]] (DOC).&lt;ref name="BenedekBauer2008"/&gt; This document gave the DOC oversight over some of the ICANN operations.&lt;ref name="BenedekBauer2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacKinnon2012"/&gt;

During July 2008, the DOC reiterated an earlier statement&lt;ref name="2005-07-us" /&gt; that it has "no plans to transition management of the authoritative [[root zone file]] to ICANN". The letter also stresses the separate roles of the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] and [[VeriSign]].&lt;ref name="U.S. DoC letter to ICANN's chairman"/&gt;

On September 30, 2009, ICANN signed an agreement with the DOC (known as the "Affirmation of Commitments") that confirmed ICANN's commitment to a [[multistakeholder governance model]],&lt;ref name="ZDNet2009"&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/article/us-government-finally-lets-icann-go/ "US Government finally lets ICANN go"], Eileen Yu, [[ZDNet]], September 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; but did not remove it from DOC oversight and control.

On March 10, 2016, ICANN and the DOC signed a historic, culminating agreement to finally remove ICANN and IANA from the control and oversight of the DOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/14/icann-internet-control-domain-names-iana|title=Quietly, symbolically, US control of the internet was just ended|last=Farrell|first=Maria|date=March 14, 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 2016, ICANN was freed from U.S. government oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/u-government-no-longer-controls-160017929.html|title=The U.S. government no longer controls the Internet|website=[[Yahoo!

==Notable events==
On March 18, 2002, publicly elected At-Large Representative for North America board member [[Karl Auerbach]] sued ICANN in Superior Court in California to gain access to ICANN's accounting records without restriction. Auerbach won.&lt;ref name="eff"/&gt;

During September and October 2003, ICANN played a crucial role in the conflict over [[VeriSign]]'s "wild card" DNS service [[Site Finder]]. After an open letter from ICANN issuing an ultimatum to VeriSign, later endorsed by the [[Internet Architecture Board]],&lt;ref name="Wildcard entries in DNS entries"/&gt; the company voluntarily ended the service on October 4, 2003. After this action, VeriSign filed a lawsuit against ICANN on February 27, 2004, claiming that ICANN had exceeded its authority. By this lawsuit, VeriSign sought to reduce ambiguity about ICANN's authority. The antitrust component of VeriSign's claim was dismissed during August 2004. VeriSign's challenge that ICANN overstepped its contractual rights is currently outstanding. A proposed settlement already approved by ICANN's board would resolve VeriSign's challenge to ICANN in exchange for the right to increase pricing on .com domains. At the meeting of ICANN in Rome, which took place from March 2 to 6, 2004, ICANN agreed to ask approval of the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]] for the [[Waiting List Service]] of VeriSign.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

On May 17, 2004, ICANN published a proposed budget for the year 2004–05. It included proposals to increase the openness and professionalism of its operations, and greatly increased its proposed spending from US$8.27&amp;nbsp;million to $15.83&amp;nbsp;million. The increase was to be funded by the introduction of new [[top-level domain]]s, charges to [[Domain name registry|domain registries]], and a fee for some domain name registrations, renewals and transfers (initially USD 0.20 for all domains within a country-code top-level domain, and USD 0.25 for all others).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The [[Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries]] (CENTR), which represents the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|Internet registries]] of 39 countries, rejected the increase, accusing ICANN of a lack of financial prudence and criticizing what it describes as ICANN's "unrealistic political and operational targets". Despite the criticism, the registry agreement for the top-level domains &lt;tt&gt;jobs&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;travel&lt;/tt&gt; includes a US$2 fee on every domain the licensed companies sell or renew.&lt;ref name="theregister"/&gt;

After a second round of negotiations during 2004, the TLDs &lt;tt&gt;[[.eu|eu]]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;[[.asia|{{not a typo|asia}}]]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;[[.travel|travel]]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;[[.jobs|jobs]]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;[[.mobi|mobi]]&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;[[.cat|cat]]&lt;/tt&gt; were introduced during 2005.

[[Image:Cerf's Up-marquee-20071031.jpg|thumb|ICANN meeting, Los Angeles USA, 2007. The sign refers to [[Vint Cerf]], then chairman of the board of directors, who is working on the so-called [[Interplanetary Internet]].]]
On February 28, 2006, ICANN's board approved a settlement with VeriSign in the lawsuit resulting from SiteFinder that involved allowing VeriSign (the registry) to raise its registration fees by up to 7% a year.&lt;ref name="icann"/&gt; This was criticised by a few members of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]' [[United States Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship|Small Business Committee]].&lt;ref name="com"/&gt;

During February 2007, ICANN began procedures to end accreditation of one of their registrars, [[RegisterFly]] amid charges and lawsuits involving fraud, and criticism of ICANN's management of the situation. ICANN has been the subject of criticism as a result of its handling of RegisterFly, and the harm caused to thousands of clients as a result of what has been termed ICANN's "laissez faire attitude toward customer allegations of fraud".&lt;ref name="TheRegisterICANNCriticism1"/&gt;

On May 23, 2008, ICANN issued enforcement notices against ten accredited registrars and announced this through a press release entitled "'Worst Spam Offenders' Notified by ICANN, Compliance system working to correct Whois and other issues."&lt;ref name="icann1"/&gt; This was largely in response to a report issued by [[KnujOn]], called "The 10 Worst Registrars" in terms of spam advertised junk product sites and compliance failure.&lt;ref name="knujon"/&gt; The mention of the word "[[Spam (electronic)|spam]]" in the title of the ICANN memo is somewhat misleading since ICANN does not address issues of spam or email abuse. Website content and usage are not within ICANN's mandate. However, the KnujOn report details how various registrars have not complied with their contractual obligations under the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA).&lt;ref name="icann2"/&gt; The main point of the KnujOn research was to demonstrate the relationships between compliance failure, illicit product traffic, and spam. The report demonstrated that out of 900 ICANN accredited registrars, fewer than 20 held 90% of the web domains advertised in spam. These same registrars were also most frequently cited by KnujOn as failing to resolve complaints made through the Whois Data Problem Reporting System (WDPRS).

On June 26, 2008, the ICANN Board started a [[.events|new process of TLD naming policy]] to take a "significant step forward on the introduction of new generic top-level domains." This program envisions the availability of many new or already proposed domains, as well a new application and implementation process.&lt;ref name="32nd International Public ICANN Meeting"/&gt;

On October 1, 2008, ICANN issued breach notices against Joker and Beijing Innovative Linkage Technology Ltd.&lt;ref name="icann3"/&gt; after further researching reports and complaints issued by KnujOn. These notices gave the registrars 15 days to fix their Whois investigation efforts.

In 2010, ICANN approved a major review of its policies with respect to [[accountability]], transparency, and public participation by the [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="icann4"/&gt; This external review was an assistance of the work of ICANN's Accountability and Transparency Review team.&lt;ref name="icann5"/&gt;

On February 3, 2011, ICANN announced that it had distributed the last batch of its remaining IPv4 addresses to the world's five Regional Internet Registries, the organizations that manage IP addresses in different regions. These registries began assigning the final IPv4 addresses within their regions until they ran out completely.&lt;ref name="icann6"/&gt;

On June 20, 2011, the ICANN board voted to end most restrictions on the names of [[generic top-level domain]]s (gTLD).&lt;ref name="VOA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zdnet"/&gt; Companies and organizations became able to choose essentially arbitrary top-level Internet domain names. The use of non-Latin characters (such as Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese, etc.) is also allowed in gTLDs. ICANN began accepting applications for new gTLDS on January 12, 2012.&lt;ref name="VOA"/&gt; The initial price to apply for a new gTLD was set at $185,000&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; and the annual renewal fee is $25,000.&lt;ref name="icann7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mashable"/&gt;

Following the 2013 [[NSA spying scandal]], ICANN endorsed the [[Montevideo Statement]],&lt;ref name=montevideo&gt;[https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2013-10-07-en Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation], ICANN, October 7, 2013.

Retrieved November 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2016, ICANN ended its contract with the United States Department of Commerce National Telecommunications and Information Administration (&lt;abbr&gt;NTIA&lt;/abbr&gt;) and entered the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2016-10-01-en|title=Stewardship of IANA Functions Transitions to Global Internet Community as Contract with U.S. Government Ends – ICANN|website=''icann.org''|access-date=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
From its founding to the present, ICANN has been formally organized as a nonprofit corporation "for charitable and public purposes" under the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law. It is managed by a 16-member board of directors composed of eight members selected by a nominating committee on which all the constituencies of ICANN are represented; six representatives of its Supporting Organizations, sub-groups that deal with specific sections of the policies under ICANN's purview; an at-large seat filled by an at-large organization; and the President / CEO, appointed by the board.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icann.org/en/about/governance/bylaws#VI BYLAWS FOR INTERNET CORPORATION FOR ASSIGNED NAMES AND NUMBERS | A California Nonprofit Public-Benefit Corporation]. ICANN. Retrieved April 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently three supporting organizations: the Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO) deals with policy making on [[generic top-level domain]]s (gTLDs);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://icannwiki.org/Generic_Names_Supporting_Organization|title=Generic Names Supporting Organization|publisher= ICANNWiki}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Country Code Names Supporting Organization]] (ccNSO) deals with policy making on [[country-code top-level domain]]s (ccTLDs); the [[Address Supporting Organization]] (ASO) deals with policy making on IP addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bylaws For Internet Corporation For Assigned Names And Numbers|url=https://www.icann.org/resources| website=''icann.org''|location=Go to Governance, Bylaws, ARTICLE VIII-Article X| date=February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICANN also relies on some advisory committees and other advisory mechanisms to receive advice on the interests and needs of stakeholders that do not directly participate in the Supporting Organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bylaws For Internet Corporation For Assigned Names And Numbers|url=https://www.icann.org/resources| website=''icann.org''|location=Go to Governance, Bylaws, ARTICLE XI and ARTICLE XI-A| date=February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), which is composed of representatives of a large number of national governments from all over the world; the [[At-Large Advisory Committee]] (ALAC), which is composed of individual Internet users from around the world selected by each of the Regional At-Large Organizations (RALO)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.icann.org/display/atlarge/Regional+At-Large+Organisations|title=Regional At-Large Organisations – ALAC – Confluence|website=community.icann.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nominating Committee; the Root Server System Advisory Committee, which provides advice on the operation of the DNS root server system; the Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC), which is composed of Internet experts who study security issues pertaining to ICANN's mandate; and the Technical Liaison Group (TLG), which is composed of representatives of other international technical organizations that focus, at least in part, on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bylaws For Internet Corporation For Assigned Names And Numbers|url=https://www.icann.org/resources| website=''icann.org''|location=Go to Governance, Bylaws, ARTICLE XI and ARTICLE XI-A, Section 2| date=February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic input===
In the [[Memorandum of understanding]] that set up the relationship between ICANN and the U.S. government, ICANN was given a mandate requiring that it operate "in a bottom up, consensus driven, democratic manner." However, the attempts that ICANN have made to establish an [[organizational structure]] that would allow wide input from the global Internet community did not produce results amenable to the current Board. As a result, the At-Large constituency and direct election of board members by the global Internet community were soon abandoned.&lt;ref name="participation"/&gt;

ICANN [[List of ICANN meetings|holds periodic public meetings]] rotated between continents for the purpose of encouraging global participation in its processes. Resolutions of the ICANN Board, preliminary reports, and minutes of the meetings, are published on the ICANN website, sometimes in real time. However, there are criticisms from ICANN constituencies including the Noncommercial Users Constituency (NCUC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gnso.icann.org/about/stakeholders-constituencies/ncsg/ncuc|title=Non-Commercial Users – Generic Names Supporting Organization|website=gnso.icann.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[At-Large Advisory Committee]] (ALAC) that there is not enough [[Freedom of information legislation|public disclosure]] and that too many discussions and decisions take place out of sight of the public.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

During the early 2000s, there had been speculation that the United Nations might assume control of ICANN,&lt;ref name="U.N. Summit to Focus on Internet"/&gt; followed by a negative reaction from the U.S. government&lt;ref name="2005-07-us"/&gt; and worries about a division of the Internet.&lt;ref name="Power grab could split the net"/&gt; The [[World Summit on the Information Society]] in Tunisia during November 2005 agreed not to get involved in the day-to-day and technical operations of ICANN. However it also agreed to establish an international [[Internet Governance Forum]], with a consultative role on the future governance of the Internet. ICANN's Government Advisory Committee is currently established to provide advice to ICANN regarding public policy issues and has participation by many of the world's governments.&lt;ref name="icann_gac"/&gt;

Some have attempted to argue that ICANN was never given the authority to decide policy, e.g., choose new TLDs or exclude other interested parties who refuse to pay ICANN's US$185,000 fee, but was to be a technical caretaker. Critics{{who|date=February 2011}} suggest that ICANN should not be allowed to impose business rules on market participants, and that all TLDs should be added on a [[first-come, first-served]] basis and the market should be the arbiter of who succeeds and who does not.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Activities==

===Uniform Domain-Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP)===
One task that ICANN was asked to do was to address the issue of domain name ownership resolution for [[generic top-level domain]]s (gTLDs). ICANN's attempt at such a policy was drafted in close cooperation with the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), and the result has now become known as the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy|Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy]] (UDRP). This policy essentially attempts to provide a mechanism for rapid, cheap and reasonable resolution of domain name conflicts, avoiding the traditional court system for disputes by allowing cases to be brought to one of a set of bodies that arbitrate domain name disputes. According to ICANN policy, a domain registrant must agree to be bound by the UDRP—they cannot get a domain name without agreeing to this.

Examination of the UDRP decision patterns has caused some&lt;ref name="vjolt"/&gt; to conclude that compulsory domain name arbitration is less likely to give a fair hearing to domain name owners asserting defenses under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and other laws, compared to the federal courts of appeal in particular.

===Proposed elimination of public DNS whois===
In 2013, the initial report of ICANN's Expert Working Group has recommended that the present form of [[Whois]], a utility that allows anyone to know who has registered a domain name on the Internet, should be "abandoned". It recommends it be replaced with a system that keeps most registration information secret (or "gated") from most Internet users, and only discloses information for "permissible purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Initial Report from the Expert Working Group on gTLD Directory Services: A Next Generation Registration Directory Service|url=https://www.icann.org/en/groups/other/gtld-directory-services/initial-report-24jun13-en.pdf|publisher=ICANN Expert Working Group|date=June 24, 2013|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Kevin|title=Whois "killer" is a recipe for a clusterfuck|url=http://domainincite.com/16855-whois-killer-is-a-recipe-for-a-clusterfuck|accessdate=June 21, 2014|publisher=Domain Incite|date=June 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICANN's list of permissible purposes includes domain name research, domain name sale and purchase, regulatory enforcement, personal data protection, legal actions, and abuse mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpaglobal.com/newlegalreview/5558/icann_earmarks_domains_record_ Intellectual Property Solutions &amp; Legal Support Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054828/http://www.cpaglobal.com/newlegalreview/5558/icann_earmarks_domains_record_ |date=September 21, 2013 }}.

==Criticism==
Since its creation, ICANN has been the subject of criticism and controversy.&lt;ref name="DLTR 2001-02-14"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fuller|first1=Kathleen E.|date=February 14, 2001|title=ICANN: The Debate Over Governing the Internet|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=dltr|format=PDF|journal=Duke Law &amp; Technology Review|publisher=[[Duke University]]|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeremy Malcolm"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Malcolm|first=Jeremy|title=Multi-Stakeholder Public Policy Governance and its Application to the Internet Governance Forum|type=PhD|chapter=2.1.3.

During December 2011, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] stated ICANN had long failed to provide safeguards that protect consumers from online [[Charlatan|swindlers]].&lt;ref name="CNN 2011-12-21"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/22/tech/web/icann/|title=Keepers of the Internet face their greatest challenges ever|last1=Milian|first1=Mark|date=December 21, 2011|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during 2011, seventy-nine companies, including [[The Coca-Cola Company]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Samsung]] and others, signed a petition against ICANN's new TLD program (sometimes referred to as a "commercial landgrab"&lt;ref name="The Guardian 2012-06-13"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/13/icann-criticised-commercial-landgrab-internet|title=Icann criticised over 'commercial landgrab' of internet|last1=Arthur|first1=Charles|date=June 13, 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), in a group organized by the [[Association of National Advertisers]].&lt;ref name="NPR 2012-06-14"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2012/06/13/154960405/icanns-call-for-new-domain-names-brings-criticism-and-357-million|title=ICANN's Call For New Domain Names Brings Criticism, And $357 Million|last1=Chappell|first1=Bill|date=June 14, 2012|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2014, this group, the [[Coalition for Responsible Internet Domain Oversight]], that opposes the rollout of ICANN's TLD expansion program, has been joined by 102 associations and 79 major companies.&lt;ref name="ANA CRIDO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ana.net/content/show/id/crido|title=Coalition for Responsible Internet Domain Oversight (CRIDO)|publisher=[[Association of National Advertisers|ANA]]|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly as a response to this criticism, ICANN initiated an effort to protect trademarks in domain name registrations, which eventually culminated in the establishment of the [[Trademark Clearinghouse]].

===IBSA proposal (2011)===
One controversial proposal, resulting from a September 2011 summit between India, Brazil, and South Africa (IBSA), would seek to move Internet governance into a "UN Committee on Internet-Related Policy" (UN-CIRP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muzzlers of the Free Internet|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2220692/How-India-helped-bunch-bureaucrats-custodians-Internet.html|publisher=Mail Today (New Delhi, India)|accessdate=March 15, 2013|location=London|first=Sandeep|last=Bamzai|date=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IBSA-2011&gt;[http://www.culturalivre.org.br/artigos/IBSA_recommendations_Internet_Governance.pdf "Recommendations from the IBSA (India-Brazil-South Africa) Multistakeholder meeting on Global Internet Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005063245/http://www.culturalivre.org.br/artigos/IBSA_recommendations_Internet_Governance.pdf |date=October 5, 2011 }}, September 1–2, 2011, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil&lt;/ref&gt; The action was a reaction to a perception that the principles of the 2005 Tunis Agenda for the Information Society have not been met.&lt;ref name=IBSA-2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs2/tunis/off/6rev1.html "Tunis Agenda for the Information Society"], World Summit on the Information Society, November 18, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The statement proposed the creation of a new political organization operating as a component of the United Nations to provide policy recommendations for the consideration of technical organizations such as ICANN and international bodies such as the ITU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India's Statement Proposing UN Committee for Internet-Related Policy|url=http://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/india-statement-un-cirp/|publisher=Centre for Internet and Society|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to public criticisms, the Indian government backed away from the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaul|first=Mahima|title=India changes its internet governance position – backs away from UN proposal|url=http://uncut.indexoncensorship.org/2012/10/india-internet-governance/|publisher=UNCUT|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation (2013)===
On October 7, 2013 the [[Montevideo Statement]] on the Future of Internet Cooperation was released by the managers of a number of organizations involved in coordinating the Internet's global technical infrastructure, loosely known as the "I*" (or "I-star") group. Among other things, the statement "expressed strong concern over the undermining of the trust and confidence of Internet users globally due to recent revelations of pervasive monitoring and surveillance" and "called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions, towards an environment in which all stakeholders, including all governments, participate on an equal footing". This desire to reduce United States association with the internet is considered a reaction to the ongoing [[PRISM (surveillance program)|NSA surveillance scandal]]. The statement was signed by the managers of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]], the [[Internet Architecture Board]], the [[World Wide Web Consortium]], the [[Internet Society]], and the five [[Regional Internet Registries|regional Internet address registries]] ([[African Network Information Center]], [[American Registry for Internet Numbers]], [[Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre]], [[Latin America and Caribbean Internet Addresses Registry]], and [[Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icann.org/en/news/announcements/announcement-07oct13-en.htm Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation], ICANN, October 7, 2013.

===Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (2013)===
During October 2013, Fadi Chehadé, current President and CEO of ICANN, met with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff in Brasilia. Upon Chehadé's invitation, the two announced that Brazil would host an international summit on Internet governance during April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJmFAMJNx94 "Entrevista com Fadi Chehadé: Brasil sediará encontro mundial de governança da internet em 2014"], Palácio do Planalto, October 9, 2013.

===NetMundial Initiative (2014)===

The meeting produced a nonbinding statement in favor of consensus-based decision-making. It represented a compromise and did not harshly condemn mass surveillance or include the words "net neutrality", despite initial endorsement for that from Brazil. The final resolution says ICANN should be controlled internationally by September 2015.&lt;ref name=businessweek&gt;

====Controversy====
The [[.sucks (registry)|.sucks domain registrar]] has been described as "predatory, exploitive and coercive" by the Intellectual Property Constituency that advises the ICANN board.&lt;ref name=reg1/&gt; When the .sucks registry announced their pricing model, "most brand owners were upset and felt like they were being penalized by having to pay more to protect their brands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.circleid.com/posts/20150625_is_sucks_pricing_model_gaining_traction_with_other_registries/|title=Is .SUCKS Pricing Model Gaining Traction With Other Registries?|date=June 25, 2015|work=CircleID}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the low utility of the ".sucks" domain, most fees come from "Brand Protection" customers registering their trademarks to prevent domains being registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2015/mar/23/why-you-should-buy-your-dot-sucks-domain-name|title=Why You Should Buy Your Dot Sucks Domain Name|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian brands had complained that they were being charged "exorbitant" prices to register their trademarks as premium names. FTC chair Edith Ramirez has written to ICANN to say the agency will take action against the .sucks owner if  "we have reason to believe an entity has engaged in deceptive or unfair practices in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipprotheinternet.com/ipprotheinternetnews/article.php?article_id=4446|title=Canada weighs in on .sucks debate|date=June 19, 2015|work=IP Pro}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Register reported that intellectual property lawyers are infuriated that "the dot-sucks registry was charging trademark holders $2,500 for .sucks domains and everyone else $10."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/06/15/canada_to_icann_take_off_you_hoser/|title=Canada to ICANN in dot-sucks dot-rumble: Take off, you hoser!|work=The Register|date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Representative [[Bob Goodlatte]] has said that trademark holders are "being shaken down" by the registry's fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/05/19/new-domain-sparks-icann-debate/|title=A Debate Over the Domain ‘.sucks’|work=Wall Stree Journal|date=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jay Rockefeller]] says that .sucks is a "a predatory shakedown scheme" and "Approving '.sucks', a gTLD with little or no public interest value, will have the effect of undermining the credibility ICANN has slowly been building with skeptical stakeholders."&lt;ref name=reg1/&gt;

===.islam and .halal domains===

On July 30, 2018, [[whistleblower]] and writer for [[the Register]] Kieran McCarthy exposed the systematic refusal of ICANN to create the .islam and .halal gTLDs through the willful breaking of the organization's own bylaws. McCarthy coined the 6-year refusal as "the internet's very own [[Trump travel ban|Muslim ban]]" after ICANN [[kowtow|kowtowed]] to Middle Eastern governments by not approving the domain name additions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/07/30/icann_muslim_ban/|title=The internet's very own Muslim ban continues: DNS overlord insists it can freeze dot-words}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is deeply committed to providing open, public access to art by offering year-round free admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icamiami.org/visit/|title=Visit {{!}} Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami|work=Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Institute of Contemporary Art first opened in 1996 under the ''Museum of Contemporary art'' in a building designed by [[Charles Gwathmey]]. In 2014, due to issues of zoning, the museum’s board sued the city for the right to move, leading to the establishment of the Institute of Contemporary Art in 2017 in the current Design District location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/institute-of-contemporary-art-miami-museum-highlights |title= Inside the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami's Newest Museum |website=W Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami]] remains at the old location. 

== Architecture ==
[[File:ICA Miami 17-11 2839 03.jpg|thumb|ICA Miami: view from the front]]
Funded by Norman Braman and his wife, who remains co-chair on the board of trustees at ICA, the architectural design of the museum’s building is an integral part of the museum’s reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/11/arts/design/in-miami-the-bramans-plan-the-institute-of-contemporary-art.html|title=Envisioning a Museum, the Sky’s the Limit|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Designed in 2017 by Aranguren &amp; Gallegos architects, the building was constructed to mimic a “Magic Box” with its bright and geometrically shape and texture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archdaily.com/889152/ica-miami-museum-aranguren-and-gallegos-arquitectos|title=ICA Miami Museum / Aranguren&amp;Gallegos Arquitectos|date=2018-02-18|work=ArchDaily|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building consists of 37,500-square-feet of space, including its exterior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.surfacemag.com/articles/institute-contemporary-art-miami-gets-new-home/|title=The Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami, Gets a New Home|website=Surface Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three stories tall, with 20,000 feet of gallery space to house the various exhibitions and permanent collection, as well as a sculpture garden in the back, the structure borders the residential neighbourhood adjacent to the Design District.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.culturedmag.com/ica-miami/|title=ICA Miami Makes its Much Anticipated Debut with The Everywhere Studio|date=2017-11-27|work=Cultured Magazine|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The back side of the structure is lined with windows to keep sunshine coming through the building, and to give any visitors a chance to see the sculpture garden that lies below the rows of windows. The 15,000 foot sculpture garden is home to works by [[Mark Handforth]], [[Abigail DeVille]], [[Allora &amp; Calzadilla|Allora and Calzadilla]], and [[Pedro Reyes (artist)|Pedro Reyes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.culturedmag.com/ica-miami/|title=ICA Miami Makes its Much Anticipated Debut with The Everywhere Studio|date=2017-11-27|work=Cultured Magazine|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was visualised as a sort of magnet, both literally and figuratively. Not only was the concept of attracting the public with a geometrical design important to the concept, but the facade of the building itself can be compared to the dark grey and smooth material of any magnet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2017/12/05/institute-contemporary-art-ica-miami-opens-permanent-home-metal-faced-building-aranguren-gallegos-design-district/|title=ICA Miami opens permanent home in metal-faced building|date=2017-12-05|work=Dezeen|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Permanent Collection ==
As is true for much of the museum’s art, Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami’s permanent collection seeks to reflect efforts to expose new talent, while also showcasing many well known artists.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt; The collection include works from many different artists including [[Rita Ackermann|Rita Ackerman]], [[Francis Alÿs]], [[Hernan Bas]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[William Copley (artist)|William Copley]], Ann Craven, [[José Antonio Hernández-Díez|Jose Antonio Hernandez Diez]], [[Inka Essenhigh]], [[Mark Handforth]], [[Jim Hodges (artist)|Jim Hodges]], [[Edward Kienholz|Nancy and Edward Kienholz]], [[Guillermo Kuitca]], [[Zoe Leonard]], [[John Miller (American artist)|John Miller]], [[Malcolm Morley|Malcom Morley]], [[Chris Ofili]], [[Gabriel Orozco]], Enoc Perez, [[Raymond Pettibon]], Robert Therrien, and [[James Turrell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icamiami.org/collection/page/5/|title=Collection Archive {{!}} Page 5 of 10 {{!}} Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami|website=Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
With its opening in December 2017, Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami provided another exhibition platform for Miami Art Basel, a critically acclaimed cultural attraction to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artbasel.com/news/alex-gartenfeld-ica-miami|title=ICA Miami’s Alex Gartenfeld: ‘This is a museum that refuses to be an artistic temple’ {{!}} Art Basel|last=Basel|first=Art|website=Art Basel|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various artists had work shown at the opening, such as [[Abigail DeVille|Abigail DeVille’]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s work in the sculpture garden, Tomm el-Saieh, [[Senga Nengudi]], [[Edward Kienholz|Edward and Nancy Kienholz]], and [[Hélio Oiticica]].  Furthermore, ICA introduced “The Everywhere Studio.” The exhibition, which was curated by Alex Gartenfield, director of the museum, Gean Moreno, program curator for the museum, and Stephanie Siedel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.widewalls.ch/ica-miami-the-everywhere-studio/|title=Time In Our Hands: ICA Miami's The Everywhere Studio|work=Widewalls|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Everywhere studio was considered to be the most notable portion of the museum’s opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/institute-of-contemporary-art-miami-museum-highlights|title=Inside the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami's Newest Museum|last=Lubow|first=Arthur|work=W Magazine|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It showcased more than 100 works from more than fifty artists spanning over the past five decades. The exhibition became known for its mixing of well known and unknown artists and wide variety of time and location explored. [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]], both well-known artist from the mid 20th century, were showcased amongst far lesser known Miami artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://resnicow.com/client-news/ica-miami-unveils-inaugural-program-its-new-permanent-home-opening-december-1-2017|title=ICA Miami Unveils Inaugural Program of its New Permanent Home, Opening December 1, 2017|date=2017-06-29|work=R+A|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.widewalls.ch/ica-miami-the-everywhere-studio/|title=Time In Our Hands: ICA Miami's The Everywhere Studio|work=Widewalls|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since its opening exhibitions, the museum has housed many different exhibitions. In April 2018, [[Donald Judd]] was represented in “Donald Judd: Paintings,” an exhibition that showcased 14 of Judd’s paintings from the years 1959 to 1961. Within the same month, exhibitions by [[Walter Darby Bannard]] and [[Francis Alÿs]] opened to the public. Later, in May of 2018, ICA Miami focused on [[Diamond Stingily]] in the artist’s first solo show, “Diamond Stingily: Life In My Pocket.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icamiami.org/exhibitions/|title=Exhibitions {{!}} Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami|work=Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multi-media exhibition drew large crowds at its opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.miamitodaynews.com/2018/06/19/new-institute-of-contemporary-art-leaders-hail-attendance/|title=New Institute of Contemporary Art Leaders hail attendance - Miami Today|website=www.miamitodaynews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, an exhibit of [[Terry Adkins|Terry Adkins’]] work opened in one of the museum’s exhibition spaces. “Terry Adkins: Infinity Is Always Less Than One” comprised more than 50 works from throughout the artist’s life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/terry-adkins-posthumous-exhibit-at-ica-miami-may-17-10339183|title=ICA Miami Mounts First Posthumous Terry Adkins Show|last=Vazquez|first=Neil|date=2018-05-11|work=Miami New Times|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July of 2018, [[Sondra Perry]]’s exhibition, “Sondra Perry: Typhoon Coming On,” was opened to the public. Perry’s exhibition used multiple forms of media to “explore the intersection of black identity, digital culture and power.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artrabbit.com/events/sondra-perry-typhoon-coming-on-ica-miami|title=Sondra Perry: Typhoon coming on - Exhibition at ICA Miami in Miami|website=ArtRabbit|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also opened in July of 2018, ICA Miami created a space for works by [[Louise Bourgeois]]. With one of the artist’s works already in the museum’s permanent collection, the exhibition focuses on Bourgeois’ other notable sculptures. In early November 2018, ICA Miami curated Manuel Solano’s exhibition, “Manuel Solano:I Don’t Wanna Wait For Our Lives To Be Over.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icamiami.org/exhibitions/|title=Exhibitions {{!}} Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami|work=Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Larry Bell: Time Machine,” also opened in November, surveys many of [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]]’s various works, from his early works to the glass sculptures and works he is generally known for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://resnicow.com/client-news/major-solo-exhibitions-judy-chicago-and-larry-bell-culminate-2018-season-institute|title=Major Solo Exhibitions of Judy Chicago and Larry Bell to Culminate 2018 Season at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami|date=2018-06-21|work=R+A|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
Apart from the free access provided to acclaimed exhibitions across various artistic platforms, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami is also known for the various programs and services it provides. ICA Ideas build upon the current exhibitions available to the public with different classes and speeches, and providing a platform for additional performances. Through this program, for example, [[Charles Gaines (artist)|Charles Gaines]] composed a performance for the museum’s crowd entitled ''A Visual Recital.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=IDEA 009: Charles Gaines Performance {{!}} Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami|url=https://www.icamiami.org/program/idea-009-charles-gaines-performance/|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICA Speaks is one of the museum’s programs that invites associated artists to give speeches or organise symposiums regarding the various permanent works displayed in the space. Panels and speeches from artists such as [[Mark Handforth]] and [[Hernan Bas]] have been arranged for purposes of explanation and audience engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=ICA Speaks: Mark Handforth {{!}} Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami|url=https://www.icamiami.org/program/ica-speaks-mark-handforth/|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICA Performs consists of various dance, theatre, and other performing art programs that put on showcases in various parts of the museum. The museum has collaborated with performance artists such as Michael Clark and [[Trisha Brown]] to provide museum-goers with live performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icamiami.org/program/ica-performs-trisha-brown-dance-company/|title=Trisha Brown: In Plain Site {{!}} Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami|work=Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, ICA Residents is an inaugural program that was dedicated to exposure of local musicians. The various events were in partnership with Miami Music Club, and they were centred around the idea of pairing local Miami artists with non-local artists in a singular showcase. The headliners were artists such as [[Drew McDowall]], Via App and Profligate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icamiami.org|title=ICA Miami: Free Admission Every Day!|website=Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overseeing the construction of the current permanent venue, Ellen Salpenter joined as director of the museum in December 2015. In early 2018, Ellen Salpenter, director of ICA Miami since 2015, stepped down. Taking Salpenter's place, Alex Gartenfield, the deputy director and chief curator, became artistic director in 2018, with Tommy Ralph Pace taking on the role of deputy director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2018/04/12/ellen-salpeter-steps-director-ica-miami/|title=Ellen Salpeter Steps Down as Director of ICA Miami|last=Battaglia|first=Andy|date=2018-04-12|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gartenfield is also known for his work at the New Museum, where he is co-curator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/arts/design/new-museum-triennial.html|title=Meet Six Disrupters at the New Museum’s Triennial|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{merge|list of classical abbreviations|date=July 2017}}
This is a '''list of common [[Latin]] [[abbreviation]]s'''. Nearly all the abbreviations below have been adopted by [[Modern English]].  However, with some exceptions (for example, ''versus'' or ''[[modus operandi]]''), most of the Latin referent words and phrases are perceived as foreign to English.  In a few cases, English referents have replaced the original Latin ones (e.g., "[[rest in peace]]" for RIP and "post script" for PS).

[[Latin]] was once the universal academic language in Europe. From the 18th century authors started using their mother tongues to write books, papers or proceedings. Even when Latin fell out of use, many Latin abbreviations continued to be used due to their precise simplicity and Latin's status as a learnèd language.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In July 2016, the government of the [[United Kingdom]] announced that its websites would no longer use Latin abbreviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2016/07/20/changes-to-the-style-guide-no-more-eg-and-ie-etc/|title=Changes to the style guide: no more eg, and ie, etc|accessdate=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of common abbreviations==
All abbreviations are given with [[full stops]], although these are omitted or included as a personal preference in most situations.

|-
||{{Anchor|confer}}[[cf.]]||''[[confer]]''||"bring together" and hence "compare"||''Confer'' is the imperative of the Latin verb ''conferre''.&lt;ref name="Maurer" /&gt; Used interchangeably with "cp." in citations indicating the reader should compare a statement with that from the cited source.&lt;br/&gt;Example: ''These results were similar to those obtained using different techniques ('''cf.''' Wilson, 1999 and Ansmann, 1992).''
It is also widely used as an abbreviation for "''see''", although some styles recommend against such use. 
|-
||{{Anchor|compare}}cp.||||''compare''||Used interchangeably with "cf." in citations indicating the reader should compare a statement with that from the cited source. &lt;br/&gt;Example: ''These results were similar to those obtained using different techniques ('''cp.''' Wilson, 1999 and Ansmann, 1992).''
|-
||{{Anchor|ceteris paribus}}Cp||''[[ceteris paribus]]''||"all other things being equal"||Commonly used in economics, ceteris paribus allows for supply and demand models to reflect specific variables. If one assumes that the only thing changing is, say, the price of wheat, then demand and supply will both be affected appropriately. While this is simplification of actual dynamic market models, it makes learning economic theory easier.
|-
|{{Anchor|curriculum vitae}}[[Résumé|C.V.]], cv or CV||''[[curriculum vitae]]''||"course of life"||A document containing a summary or listing of relevant job experience and education. The exact usage of the term varies between British English and American English. The singular form is never vita. Curriculum is already singular, vitae is genitive from "vita", i.e. "of life", despite the plural-appearing vitae modifier. The true plural is curricula vitae. 
|-
|{{Anchor|centum weight}}[[cwt.]]||''centum weight''||"[[Hundredweight]]"&lt;ref name="USGPOstyle" /&gt;
|cwt. uses a mixture of Latin and English abbreviation.

|-
|{{Anchor|Dei gratia}}DG, D.G. or DEI GRA||''[[Dei gratia]]''||"by the grace of God".&lt;ref name="USGPOstyle" /&gt;
|A part of the monarch's title, it is found on all British and Canadian coins.

|{{Anchor|eadem}}[[ead.]]||''[[eadem]]''||"the same (woman)"||see ''[[#idem|id.]]'' below.
|-
|{{Anchor|et alii}}[[et al.]]||''[[et alii]]&lt;br/&gt;[[et alia]]&lt;br/&gt;et alibi''||"and others", "and co-workers".&lt;ref name="USGPOstyle" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"and other things"&lt;br/&gt;"and other places"
|Example: ''These results agree with the ones published by Pelon et al. (2002).''
"Etc." should not be used for people.
|-
|{{Anchor|et cetera}}[[etc.]]||''[[et caetera]]''||"and the others", "and other things", "and the rest".&lt;ref name="USGPOstyle" /&gt;
| Other archaic abbreviations include "&amp;c.", "&amp;/c.", "&amp;e.", "&amp;ct.", and "&amp;ca."
&lt;p&gt;Example: ''I need to go to the store and buy some pie, milk, cheese, '''etc.'''''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because ''cetera'' implies inanimate objects, ''et al.'' is preferred when speaking of people.&lt;/p&gt;
|-
|{{Anchor|exempli gratia}}[[exempli gratia|e.g.]]||''[[exempli gratia]]''||"for example", "for instance".&lt;ref name="USGPOstyle" /&gt;

|-
|{{Anchor|folio}}[[wikt:f.|f.]] (singular)&lt;br /&gt;[[wikt:ff.|ff.]] (plural)||''[[Recto and verso|folio]]/foliis''||"and following"||This abbreviation is used in citations to indicate an unspecified number of pages following the specified page. Example: ''see page 258'''ff.'''''
|-
|{{Anchor|ibidem}}[[ibid.]]||''[[ibidem]]''||"in the same place (book, etc.)"&lt;ref name="USGPOstyle" /&gt;||The abbreviation is used in citations. It should not be confused with the following abbreviation.
|-
|{{Anchor|idem}}[[id.]]||''[[idem]]''||"the same (man)".&lt;ref name="USGPOstyle" /&gt;||It is used to avoid repeating the name of a male author (in citations, footnotes, bibliographies, etc.) When quoting a female author, use the corresponding feminine form, [[ead.]] (''[[eadem]]''), "the same (woman)" (''eadem'' is pronounced with stress on the first ''e-'').
|-
|{{Anchor|inter alia}}[[i.a.]]||''[[inter alia]]''||"among other things".
|Example: ''Ernest Hemingway—author ('''i.a.''' 'The Sun Also Rises') and friend.''

|-
|{{Anchor|Legum Baccalaureus}}[[LL.B.]] or Ll.B.||''[[Legum Baccalaureus]]''||"bachelor of laws"||The "LL." of the abbreviation for the degree is from the genitive plural ''legum'' (singular: ''lex'' or ''legis'', for law), thus "LL.B." stands for Legum Baccalaureus in Latin. In the United States it was sometimes erroneously called "Bachelor of Legal Letters" to account for the double "L" (and therefore sometimes abbreviated as "L.L.B.").

|-
|{{Anchor|nemine contradicente}}[[nem. con.]]||''[[nemine contradicente]]''||"with no one speaking against"||The meaning is distinct from "unanimously"; "nem. con." simply means that nobody voted against. Thus there may have been abstentions from the vote.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
|-
|{{Anchor|opere citato}}[[op. cit.]]||''[[Op. cit.|opere citato]]''||"in the work cited"||Means in the same article, book or other reference work as was mentioned before. It is most often used in [[citation]]s in a similar way to "ibid", though "ibid" would usually be followed by a [[page number]].

This reading of the abbreviation implies that the delivery of the prescription (by a suitable person, following medications protocol) is done in a reactive, passive way. eg WHEN THAT HAPPENS, DO THIS. A more literal translation of the Latin is 'before a thing is born', which is an instruction to act pro-actively: eg BEFORE THAT HAPPENS, DO THIS . A prn medication delivery therefore properly done when a medic JUDGES that it should be done, in order to prevent a specified problem from occurring. Oversimplifying, a patient's breakfast could be written as a prn prescription: give this breakfast to that patient, to prevent that patient from experiencing hunger.||Used in [[Medical prescription|prescription]]s

Tell mother I say hello!''
|-

|{{Anchor|in re}}Re||''[[in re]]''||"in the matter of", "concerning"||Often used to prefix the subject of traditional [[Letter (message)|letters]] and [[memoranda]]. However, when used in an [[E-mail subject abbreviations|e-mail subject]], there is evidence that it functions as an abbreviation of "reply" rather than the word meaning "in the matter of". Nominative case singular 'res' is the Latin equivalent of 'thing'; singular 're' is the ablative case required by 'in'.  Some people believe that it is short for 'regarding', especially if it is followed by a colon (i.e., "Re:").

|-
|{{Anchor|statim}}stat.||''[[List of Latin phrases: S#statim|statim]]''||"immediately"||Often used in medical contexts.&lt;br/&gt; ''Example: That patient needs attention, '''stat.'''!''
|-
|{{Anchor|videlicet}}[[viz.]]||''[[videlicet]]''||"namely", "to wit", "precisely", "that is to say"&lt;ref name="USGPOstyle" /&gt;||In contradistinction to "i.e." and "e.g.", "viz." is used to indicate a detailed description of something stated before, and when it precedes a list of group members, it implies (near) completeness.
&lt;br/&gt;Example: ''The noble gases, '''viz.''' helium, neon, argon, xenon, krypton and radon, show a non-expected behaviour when exposed to this new element.''
|-
|{{Anchor|versus}}[[wikt:versus|vs.]] or v.||''[[wikt:versus|versus]]''||"against"||Sometimes is not abbreviated.
&lt;br/&gt;Example: ''The next football game will be the Knights '''vs.''' the Sea Eagles.'' In English law the ''v'' has no full stop (period) and is ''never'' ''vs'' and is never pronounced ''versus'' but rather as ''and'' Example: ''R(egina) v Gadd'' (a criminal case) which is pronounced as ''The Crown and Gadd.'' Similarly the film ''Kramer vs. Kramer'' is in England (at least to a lawyer): ''Kramer and Kramer'' although it would be written ''Kramer v Kramer.'' In Scots Law, the ''v'' is pronounced ''against.''  For example, ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' is pronounced ''Donoghue against Stevenson.''

* a.C.n. = [[ante Christum natum]] = [[Anno Domini|BC]] = before Christ
* ad. nat. delt. = ad naturam delineavit = he/she drew (this artwork) after nature
* AMDG (''[[Ad maiorem Dei gloriam]]'' or ''[[ad majorem Dei gloriam]]''): Latin - "For the greater glory of God". It is the [[motto]] of the [[Society of Jesus]].

* a.U.c.

(The reason for adding 1 to 753 is that the Romans counted dates "inclusively," i.e., including both the first and the last day or year in the count.)

==E==

The DST column shows the months in which Daylight Saving Time, a.k.a. Summer Time, begins and ends. A blank DST box usually indicates that the location stays on Standard Time all year, although in some cases the location stays on Summer Time all year. If a location is currently on DST, add one hour to the time in the Time column.

'''''Margaret Atwood: Once in August''''' is a 1984 documentary film about Canadian writer [[Margaret Atwood]], directed by [[Michael Rubbo]] and produced by the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB). The film was made in Rubbo's trademark style of self-conscious documentary filmmaking or [[metafilm]], with Rubbo foregrounding the creative process in making the film, including his frustrated attempts to uncover autobiographical influences in Atwood's work. It was his last film with the NFB.&lt;ref name="CFEAtwood"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Michael Rubbo | encyclopedia=Canadian Film Encyclopedia | publisher=[[Toronto International Film Festival]] | accessdate=June 13, 2012 | url=http://tiff.net/CANADIANFILMENCYCLOPEDIA/content/bios/michael-rubbo | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220141210/http://tiff.net/CANADIANFILMENCYCLOPEDIA/content/bios/michael-rubbo | archivedate=February 20, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Circling I's: some implications of the filmmaker's presence in Michael Rubbo's 'Once in August' and Marilú Mallet's 'Journal inachevé | author=Feldman, Seth | journal=Canadian and Quebec Cinema | year=1987 |format=Abstract in ''Canadian Film and Video: A Bibliography and Guide to the Literature''|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OwwjSEJSMHQC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=Margaret+Atwood:+Once+in+August&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=T9vYT6WnD-rk6QHu-8CtAw&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Margaret%20Atwood%3A%20Once%20in%20August&amp;f=false}}  
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
The film follows Rubbo's efforts to uncover the secrets of Atwood's past, only to be frustrated when the author's life fails to provide any biographical clues for her work. Atwood deflects Rubbo's autobiographical questioning with relative ease, while offering up no evidence that her work can be interpreted according to her personal life.&lt;ref name="Cooke, Nathalie"&gt;{{cite book | title=Margaret Atwood: A Critical Companion | publisher=Greenwood Press | author=Cooke, | year=2004 | isbn=978-0313328060 | page=12 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLOdJVBM3MEC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Margaret+Atwood:+Once+in+August&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=T9vYT6WnD-rk6QHu-8CtAw&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one sequence, Atwood mocks Rubbo's planned narrative trajectory when she and her family take control of the camera. Atwood puts on a paper bag over her head as family members take turns asking "who is this woman?", providing humorous responses and poking fun at Rubbo's filmmaking approach.&lt;ref name="Yorke"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Cambridge Companion to Margaret Atwood | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Yorke, Lorraine | year=2006 | isbn=978-0521839662 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NaRuLnhbl2QC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=Margaret+Atwood:+Once+in+August&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=T9vYT6WnD-rk6QHu-8CtAw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Margaret%20Atwood%3A%20Once%20in%20August&amp;f=false | page=40 | editor=Coral Ann Howells | chapter=Biography/autobiography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The ''Canadian Film Encyclopedia'' called the film "unconvincing," stating that it "put an end to his remarkable run of personal documentaries. There is an unmistakeable sense in the Atwood film that he had exhausted the form – or that he at least needed a break from this particular style. Atwood remained distant, and Rubbo never really made contact with her as a subject."&lt;ref name="CFEAtwood"/&gt;

'''Martin Joel Greif''' (February 4, 1938, [[The Bronx]], [[New York City]] - November 17, 1996, [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Ireland]]) was an American editor, lecturer, publisher and writer.  He is the uncle of [[heavy metal music]] personality and lawyer [[Eric Greif]].

== Background ==
Son of an immigrant [[Harlem]] grocery store owner, Martin Greif graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]] and was further educated at [[Hunter College]], NYC, graduating in 1959 (B.A. [[latin honors|''cum laude'']]) and [[Princeton University]], graduating in 1961 (M.A. with honours), where he was a [[Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation|Woodrow Wilson Fellow]] and groomed as an expert in [[Daniel Defoe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/449560 |chapter=The Conversion of Robinson Crusoe |registration=yes |access-date=April 20, 2016 |website=JSTOR |date=Summer 1966 |publisher=Rice University |title=Studies in English Literature, 1500–1900 |doi=10.2307/449560 |first=Martin J. |last=Greif |volume=6 |number=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ywes.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/XLVII/1/224.pdf |title=Oxford Journals |publisher=Ywes.oxfordjournals.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation he became a professor of English and taught in NY universities from 1963–73, including lecturing in biblical literature at New York University,&lt;ref&gt;[http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jan1980/v36-4-criticscorner4.htm Theology Today] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822120311/http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jan1980/v36-4-criticscorner4.htm |date=August 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before entering the world of publishing as managing editor of [[Time-Life]] Books (1969–73), and then as co-founder and editorial director of Main Street Press. Main Street Press was founded in 1978 by Greif and his life partner, Lawrence Grow, in [[Clinton, New Jersey]]. Their first office was on Main Street in Clinton, hence the name. Both men had enjoyed successful publishing careers in [[Manhattan]] but wanted to move to the country for the wide, open spaces and the lower costs. Subsequently the business moved to nearby [[Pittstown, New Jersey]]. Main Street specialized in publishing books on [[Americana]], crafts and restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shirley HornerPublished: July 23, 1989 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7D7163DF930A15754C0A96F948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print |title=NY Times |publisher=New York Times |date=1989-07-23 |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their biggest publishing success was the [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue magazine]] spoof ''Dogue'' (1986), featuring modeling canines and billed as "a parody of the world's most famous fashion magazine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dogue-Parody-Worlds-Fashion-Magazine/dp/1586639498 |title=Amazon |publisher=Amazon |date= |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== American career ==
[[Image:GayBook200.jpg|right|thumb|Martin Greif's popular book, "The Gay Book of Days" (1982)]]
Martin Greif became a prolific and varied author and book editor. His more than a dozen books range from ''Depression Modern: The Thirties Style in America'' (1975), a photo study of 1930s American design, predominantly architecture, that sought to define a wider, more American definition of Art Deco; ''Aunt Sammy's Radio Recipes'' (1975); ''The New Industrial Landscape: The Story of the Austin Company'' (1978); ''The Morning Stars Sang: The Bible in Folk Art'' (1978); ''The Airport Book: From Landing Field to Modern Terminal'' (1979); ''The Lighting Book: A Buyer's Guide to Locating Almost Every Kind of Lighting Device'' (1986); and ''The World of Tomorrow: The 1939 New York World's Fair'' (1988). The book for which he is best remembered, however, is ''The Gay Book of Days'' (1982) - "An evocatively illustrated who's who of who is, was, may have been, probably was, and almost certainly seems to have been gay during the past 5,000 years."

''The Gay Book of Days'' was a gossipy, witty and lighthearted attempt to catalogue as many famous, and not so famous, gay men and lesbians as possible throughout history, ranging from Roman emperors, European kings and queens, famous writers and literary figures to the stars of Hollywood and television. For all its supposed frivolity, it was an important work at a time when the gay community was growing in confidence and visibility and was about to be struck unawares by the AIDS epidemic. Tellingly for the time, the book ends with a list headed "I Know They Are, You Know They Are, and They Know They Are, but Initials Will Just Have to Do", betraying the reality of the closet in those less open times.

Greif and Grow also wrote a few books using different, sometimes female, [[Pen name|nom de plumes]] - Jean Bach, Frederick S. Copely, Martin Lawrence and Leona Wesley Hunter.

== Irish years ==
[[Image:Mairtin O'Griofa.jpg|right|thumb|"Celtic Tales of Terror" (1997), one of several Irish-themed works for Sterling Publishing (written as ''Mairtin O'Griofa''), that came out after Greif's death]]
Greif was often asked to write an updated version of the ''Book of Days'', to which he gave considerable thought during the 1990s, but he never got beyond the planning stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0818403322 |title=Amazon |publisher=Amazon |date= |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Greif and Larry Grow spent their latter years in [[Ballinadee]], [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]], where they set up Orchard Hill Press in a deal with [[Sterling Publishing]] of NYC. Greif's last works were several books on chess&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grief |first=Martin |url=http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/usedbooks/search?keywords=Greif%20chess&amp;pageSize=10 |title=Chapters |publisher=Chapters.indigo.ca |date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and puzzles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecampus.com/book/0806994711 |title=eCampus |publisher=eCampus |date=1997-01-04 |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Irish-themed titles written as ''Mairtin O'Griofa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/s?search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Mairtin%20O%27Griofa |title=Amazon |publisher=Amazon |date= |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grow died of a [[stroke]] associated with AIDS in 1991. Greif died of an [[AIDS]]-related illness in November 1996 at [[Cork University Hospital]].

Greif's nephew is [[Eric Greif]], a lawyer and entertainment personality known first for a management career within the heavy metal musical genre in the 1980s and later within the legal profession.

[[File:Service mark of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI).svg|thumb|right|200px|&lt;center&gt;The service mark of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute depicting a [[Saccopharyngiformes|Gulper eel]].]]
The '''Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute''' ('''MBARI''') is a private, non-profit [[oceanographic]] research center in [[Moss Landing, California]]. MBARI was founded in 1987 by [[David Packard]], and is primarily funded by the [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation]]. Christopher Scholin serves as the institute's president and chief executive officer, managing a work force of approximately 220 scientists, engineers, and operations and administrative staff.

At MBARI, scientists and engineers work together to develop new tools and methods for studying the ocean. Long-term funding from the David and Lucile  Packard Foundation allows the institute to take on studies that traditional granting institutions may be reluctant to sponsor. Part of David Packard's charge for MBARI was to "Take risks. Ask big questions. Don't be afraid to make mistakes; if you don't make mistakes, you're not reaching far enough."

MBARI's campus in Moss Landing is located near the center of Monterey Bay, at the head of the [[Monterey Canyon]]. Monterey Bay is one of the most biologically diverse bodies of waters in the world, and the underlying submarine canyon is one of the deepest underwater canyons along the continental United States. With this 4,000-meter-deep submarine canyon only a few ship-hours from their base of operations, institute scientists enjoy an advantageous proximity to this natural, deep-sea "laboratory".

MBARI is not open to the general public, but it has an open house once a year. Although MBARI is a sister institution to the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]], the two organizations have entirely separate management and funding.

== Mission ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The mission of MBARI is to achieve and maintain a position as a world center for advanced research and education in ocean science and technology, and to do so through the development of better instruments, systems, and methods for scientific research in the deep waters of the ocean. MBARI emphasizes the peer relationship between engineers and scientists as a basic principle of its operation. All of the activities of MBARI must be characterized by excellence, innovation, and vision."&amp;nbsp;—David Packard&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Research ==
MBARI's scientists, engineers, and support staff collaborate on a wide range of cutting-edge marine research projects enabled by innovative technology. MBARI's current efforts span the interdisciplinary fields of ocean science, including marine biology, geology, chemistry, and biological  oceanography. MBARI also develops new oceanographic research tools and techniques, as well as technology related to ocean observatories.

Much of MBARI's research focuses on the development and use of robotic vehicles and other automated methods for gathering information in the ocean. These tools provide a unique view of ocean life and physical phenomena.

== Research vessels ==
[[Image:RV Western Flyer.jpg|thumb|left|Research vessel ''Western Flyer'' at MBARI Pier]]
MBARI's flagship research vessel is the {{Ship|RV|Western Flyer}}, a 35.6-meter (117-foot) small water-plane area twin hull (SWATH) ship deploying the [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]], ROV ''Doc Ricketts'', through a moon pool in the center of the ship. The ''Western Flyer'' has supported ROV dives along much of the west coast of North America, from the Gulf of California to Vancouver Island, as well as around the Hawaiian islands.

In December 2011, MBARI retired the {{Ship|RV|Point Lobos}} after 23 years of service. In  2012, MBARI will also be retiring the {{Ship|RV|Zephyr}}, which has served as a launch platform for MBARI's [[autonomous underwater vehicle]]s (AUVs). These two boats will be replaced by a single, larger boat, the {{Ship|RV|Rachel Carson|2003|2}}, which MBARI purchased in the summer of 2011, and which is expected to be operational in 2012. The Research Vessel ''Rachel Carson'' will be able to launch both ROVs and AUVs, as well as conduct multi-day expeditions.

== Underwater vehicles ==
MBARI has been a pioneer in the development and scientific use of two types of underwater robots—remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). ROVs are robotic submersibles that are connected through a very long tether to a ship at the sea surface. They are controlled by pilots and researchers on board the surface ship. AUVs are robotic submersibles that are programmed at the sea surface and then released to collect data autonomously, with little or no human intervention.

MBARI's ROV ''Doc Ricketts'' is a four kilometer depth-rated vehicle, named after the pioneering marine ecologist [[Ed Ricketts]]. ROV ''Doc Ricketts'' has been deployed from the R/V ''Western Flyer'' since 2009, when it replaced ROV ''Tiburon'', which had been deployed from the R/V ''Western Flyer'' since 1997. 
[[Image:ROV Ventana on Point Lobos.jpg|thumb|upright|ROV ''Ventana'' on board of the MBARI research vessel ''Point Lobos'']]

ROV ''Ventana'' is a 1.8&amp;nbsp;km depth-rated vehicle. It was built for the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute by International Submarine Engineering according to specifications developed by David Packard and the original core group of scientists and engineers at MBARI. The vehicle was delivered in 1988 with a standard suite of instruments and cameras. Data collection sensors, a high definition camera, and animal collection devices have been added over the course of more than 3,600 dives.

In addition to ROVs, MBARI has also developed untethered undersea robots called autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). MBARI's ''Dorado''-class AUVs are 53.3 centimeters (21 inches) in diameter and can be as short as 2.4 meters (8 feet) or as long as 6.4 meters (21 feet), depending on the mission. ''Dorado''-class AUVs currently operational at MBARI include the upper-water-column AUV, the seafloor mapping AUV, and the imaging AUV. The core vehicle elements are deep-rated (the mapping AUV is 6,000 meters rated) and have been operated as long as 20 hours.

MBARI's ''Tethys'' AUV, also called the long-range AUV, is a new AUV designed to operate over longer ranges. ''Tethys'' is 30.5&amp;nbsp;cm (12 inches) in diameter, 230&amp;nbsp;cm (7.5 feet) long, and weighs 120&amp;nbsp;kg.  ''Tethys'' provides capabilities falling between existing propeller driven AUVs, which typically have endurances on the order of a day, and buoyancy-driven vehicles (gliders) that can operate for many months. In October 2011, ''Tethys'' spent 24 days at sea traveling nearly 1,800&amp;nbsp;km.

== Notable achievements ==
Frequent forays with remotely operated vehicles to the deep Monterey Canyon have enabled MBARI researchers to discover new animal species on a regular basis, and to begin to understand their significance in the ecology of the deep sea. MBARI biologists have made major contributions to research methods and the understanding of the quantity and diversity of life in the ocean.

Some of the more notable species first described by MBARI researchers include ''[[Stellamedusa ventana]]'' (bumpy jelly), ''[[Tiburonia|Tiburonia granrojo]]'' (big red), ''[[Chaetopterus pugaporcinus]]'' (pigbutt worm), and the ''[[Osedax]]'' species of bone-eating worms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G.

In 2008, MBARI deployed the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS)—the first deep-sea cabled observatory offshore of the continental United States. MARS enables researchers to hook up a variety of scientific instruments such as earthquake monitors and low-light video cameras and leave them on the deep seafloor for extended periods of time. Funded in 2002 by a grant from the National Science Foundation, the MARS Observatory was developed through a collaborative effort by MBARI, [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], the [[University of Washington]] Applied Physics Laboratory, [[NASA]]'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, L-3 MariPro, and [[Alcatel-Lucent]].

MBARI researchers have also made pioneering developments in the area of microbial oceanography. MBARI Postdoctoral Fellow Oded Beja and Scientist [[Edward DeLong]] were the first to discover a gene in several species of bacteria responsible for production of the protein rhodopsin, previously unheard of in the domain Bacteria. First developments in several areas of metagenomics have also been made at MBARI. DeLong was among the first to use metagenomics in the ocean and MBARI Scientist [[Alexandra Worden]] led the development of eukaryotic targeted metagenomics, which allows specific eukaryotic cells to be selected from natural samples and partial genomes from those uncultured cells then sequenced, assembled and analyzed.

In 2001, MBARI scientists and engineers detected the onset and development of a harmful algal bloom (HAB) using the [[Environmental Sample Processor]] (ESP)—an undersea, robotic DNA laboratory. Using the ESP, researchers are able to conduct molecular biological analyses remotely, in real-time, over a sustained period, and with interactive capability. The ESP provides in situ collection and analysis of water samples, such as the analysis of the genetic material of marine microorganisms in seawater.

'''NAS Parallel Benchmarks''' ('''NPB''') are a set of [[benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]s targeting performance evaluation of highly [[Parallel computing|parallel]] [[supercomputer]]s. They are developed and maintained by the [[NASA]] [[NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division|Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) Division]] (formerly the NASA Numerical Aerodynamic Simulation Program) based at the [[NASA Ames Research Center]]. NAS solicits performance results for NPB from all sources.&lt;ref name="npbweb"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nas.nasa.gov/Resources/Software/npb.html |title=NAS Parallel Benchmarks Changes |publisher=NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division |access-date=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Motivation===
Traditional benchmarks that existed before NPB, such as the [[Livermore loops]], the [[LINPACK|LINPACK Benchmark]] and the [http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/nas NAS Kernel Benchmark Program], were usually specialized for vector computers. They generally suffered from inadequacies including parallelism-impeding tuning restrictions and insufficient problem sizes, which rendered them inappropriate for highly parallel systems. Equally unsuitable were full-scale application benchmarks due to high porting cost and unavailability of automatic software parallelization tools.&lt;ref name="rnr94007"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to address the ensuing lack of benchmarks applicable to highly parallel machines.

===NPB 1===
The first specification of NPB recognized that the benchmarks should feature
* new parallel-aware algorithmic and software methods,
* genericness and architecture neutrality,
* easy verifiability of correctness of results and performance figures,
* capability of accommodating new systems with increased power,
* and ready distributability.
In the light of these guidelines, it was deemed the only viable approach to use a collection of "paper-and-pencil" benchmarks that specified a set of problems only algorithmically and left most implementation details to the implementer's discretion under certain necessary limits.

NPB 1 defined eight benchmarks, each in two problem sizes dubbed ''Class A'' and ''Class B''. Sample codes written in [[Fortran#FORTRAN 77|Fortran 77]] were supplied. They used a small problem size ''Class S'' and were not intended for benchmarking purposes.&lt;ref name="rnr94007"/&gt;

===NPB 2===
Since its release, NPB 1 displayed two major weaknesses. Firstly, due to its "paper-and-pencil" specification, computer vendors usually highly tuned their implementations so that their performance became difficult for scientific programmers to attain. Secondly, many of these implementation were proprietary and not publicly available, effectively concealing their optimizing techniques. Secondly, problem sizes of NPB 1 lagged behind the development of supercomputers as the latter continued to evolve.&lt;ref name="nas95020"/&gt;

NPB 2, released in 1996,&lt;ref name="npb2.2"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; came with source code implementations for five out of eight benchmarks defined in NPB 1 to supplement but not replace NPB 1. It extended the benchmarks with an up-to-date problem size ''Class C''. It also amended the rules for submitting benchmarking results. The new rules included explicit requests for output files as well as modified source files and build scripts to ensure public availability of the modifications and reproducibility of the results.&lt;ref name="nas95020"/&gt;

NPB 2.2 contained implementations of two more benchmarks.&lt;ref name="npb2.2"/&gt; NPB 2.3 of 1997 was the first complete implementation in [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]].&lt;ref name="nas03002"/&gt; It shipped with serial versions of the benchmarks consistent with the parallel versions and defined a problem size ''Class W'' for small-memory systems.&lt;ref name="npbchanges"&gt;{{cite web

'''National Democratic Youth''' ({{lang-sv|Nationaldemokratisk Ungdom}}, ''NDU'') was the [[youth organization]] of the now-defunct [[Sweden|Swedish]] political party [[National Democrats (Sweden)|National Democrats]] ({{lang-sv|Nationaldemokraterna}}).

== History ==
NDU was formed during spring 2002 and has taken a strong stance against [[multiculturalism]], [[communism]], [[homosexuality]] and [[feminism]] striving for a nation characterized by Nordic culture, tradition and national solidarity.

In 2003 the organisation performed a violent attack against the [[Gay pride]]-festival in [[Stockholm]], where they began throwing bottles and beating the participators of the parade, this later resulted in the imprisonment of the chairman [[Marc Abramsson]] on the terms of [[battery (crime)|battery]] and [[rioting]].

NDU now suffered from internal conflicts and started a period of reconstruction when [[Andreas Wallentin]] replaced the leadership. A year later he resigned to have time for studies and to work as a writer for the party's newspaper ''[[Nationell Idag]]'' (National Today). [[Robert Almgren]] took over and continued the reformation, leading it out of all the setbacks and making it a prominent and rapid-growing youth organisation again, creating new divisions all over the country. The organization disbanded together with the party in April 2014.

== Organisation ==
The members of NDU concentrated most of their work on the local level, in their respective [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipal]] organisations. These divisions were grouped together in regional districts with an organizer controlling the district's combined effort. The number of members was kept secret for safety reasons.

A congress was held annually to elect a [[chairman]] as highest authority of the youth league. In turn he appointed organizers and representatives for the regional groups. All the representatives together formed a national advisory council. In consultation between the chairman and the council the political [[manifesto]] and stance in factual matters was decided, in accordance with the parent party's ideological guidelines.

== List of chairpersons ==
*[[Marc Abramsson]], 2001–2004
*[[Andreas Wallentin]], 2004–2005
*[[Robert Almgren]], 2005–2006
*[[Patrik Forsén]], 2006–2007
*[[Andreas Nyberg]], 2007–2009

'''Nicolae Chiriac Quintescu''' (February 21, 1841&amp;ndash;August 12, 1913) was a [[Wallachia]]n, later [[Romania]]n philologist, essayist and translator.

He was born in [[Craiova]]; his father seems to have been Chiriac Chintescu, who farmed a nearby plot of land given to him on lease. Chiriac appears in a petition of 1831 and was on the city council in 1848. Nicolae later described himself as a "son of [[Oltenia]]" who grew up "in the fortifying atmosphere.... in which [[Ioan Maiorescu]] had worked". He graduated from [[Saint Sava College]] in [[Bucharest]],&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; and in 1861 left for Germany.&lt;ref name="aman"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://aman.ro/betawp/wp-content/uploads/personalitati/Q/quintescu%20nicolae%20chiriac.pdf "Quintescu, Nicolae Chiriac"], at the Alexandru and Aristia Aman County Library&lt;/ref&gt; There, he took a degree in classical philology from [[Bonn University]] and, in 1867, a doctorate in literature from the [[University of Berlin]]. The same year, after returning home, he became a professor of classical philology at the [[University of Iași]]; in 1881, he transferred to the [[University of Bucharest]],&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; retiring from the post in 1902.&lt;ref name="aman"/&gt; He became director of the capital city's higher normal school in 1898,&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; serving for a brief period of time.&lt;ref name="aman"/&gt; While in [[Iași]], Quintescu belonged to ''[[Junimea]]'' society,&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; contributing to its ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' journal,&lt;ref name="aman"/&gt; but came into conflict with other members due to disagreements over philology.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; Elected a titular member of the [[Romanian Academy]] in 1877,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.acad.ro/bdar/armembriLit.php?vidT=Q Membrii Academiei Române din 1866 până în prezent] at the Romanian Academy site&lt;/ref&gt; he served as secretary of its literary section.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; Within the Academy, he belonged to a committee tasked with writing a dictionary, and to another that met in 1903 to standardize spelling norms.&lt;ref name="aman"/&gt; His activity as a writer began when Quintescu wrote unpublished poems as a young man; he later focused on literary commentary from a comparatist perspective. He authored travel accounts, also translating [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''[[Egmont (play)|Egmont]]'' and [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[Die Huldigung der Künste]]''.&lt;ref name="sasu"&gt;Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române'', vol.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="952">The '''Novgorod Fourth Chronicle''' (Новгородская четвёртая летопись) is a [[Russia]]n [[chronicle]] of 15th century. It is traditionally called "Fourth" according to the order of the modern publication of Novgorod chronicles, rather than chronologically.

Together with the [[Sofia First Chronicle]], it is believed that it is derived from a common source. Russian philologist [[Aleksey Shakhmatov]] tentatively called it the [[Novgorodsko-Sofiysky Svod]] (Novgorod-Sofia Corpus) and initially dated it by 1448, but later revised his opinion to 1430s. Some Russian philologists shared his opinion, while others attribute the common source to the 1418 Corpus of [[Photius, Metropolitan of Moscow]].

[[File:Manfred Crowned.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The crowning of [[Manfred of Sicily]] in a [[manuscript]] of the ''Cronica''; by the 16th century, there were multiple versions of the Cronica in [[Movable type|printed form]] as well as in illuminated manuscript form.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''''Nuova Cronica''''' or '''''[[Chronicle|New Chronicles]]''''' is a 14th-century [[history of Florence]] created in a [[Annals|year-by-year]] linear format and written by the Florentine [[Banking|banker]] and official [[Giovanni Villani]] (c. 1276 or 1280&amp;ndash;1348). 
The idea came to him after attending the first [[Jubilee_(Christianity)#First_Christian_jubilee|Jubilee]] in the city of [[Rome]], in 1300, where he realized that Rome's many historical achievements were well-known, and he desired to lay out a history of the origins of his own city of [[Florence]].&lt;ref name="bartlett 36"&gt;Bartlett, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Cronica'', Villani described in detail the many building projects of the city, statistical information on population, ordinances, commerce and trade, education, and religious facilities. He also described several disasters such as famines, floods, fires, and the [[pandemic]] of the [[Black Death]] in 1348, which would take his own life.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, 36, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="benedictow 69"&gt;Benedictow, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Villani's work on the ''Cronica'' was continued by his brother and nephew after his death.&lt;ref name="bartlett 36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="caesar 148"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kleinhenz 1144"&gt;Kleinhenz, 1144.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as the first introduction of [[statistics]] as a positive element in history.&lt;ref&gt;Villani, Giovanni. Encyclopædia Britannica. [[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]]. Retrieved on 2008-03-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest manuscript is [[Vatican Library]] BAV Chigiano L VIII 296, dating to the time of composition.

==Organization==
[[Image:Giovanni villani 1.JPG|thumb|right|160px|Statue of [[Giovanni Villani]] in the Loggia del Mercato Nuovo]]
Giovanni Villani's ''Cronica'' is divided into twelve books; the first six deal with the largely legendary history of Florence, starting at conventionally [[Tower of Babel|Biblical times]] to 1264.&lt;ref name="caesar 148"&gt;Caesar, 148.&lt;/ref&gt; The second phase, in six books, covers the history from 1264 until his own time, all the way up to 1346.&lt;ref name="caesar 148"/&gt; Villani outlines the events in his ''Cronica'', not by theme, but through year-to-year accounts; for this, he has gained criticism over the years for writing in an episodic manner lacking a unifying theme or point of view.&lt;ref name="kleinhenz 1145"&gt;Kleinhenz, 1145.&lt;/ref&gt; Villani's chronicles are intercut with historical episodes reported just as he heard them, with little interpretation; this often led to historical inaccuracies in his work,&lt;ref name="chisholm 903"&gt;Chisholm, 903.&lt;/ref&gt; making most of his mistakes in the biographies of historical or contemporary people living outside of Florence (even with well-known monarchs).&lt;ref name="Wicksteed, xxxi, xxxii, xxxiii"&gt;Wicksteed, xxxi, xxxii, xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his description of such events as the [[Battle of Crécy]] in 1346 was fairly accurate according to historian [[Kelly DeVries]].&lt;ref&gt;DeVries, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Kenneth R. Bartlett]] and [[Green (surname)|Green]]{{who?|date=February 2018}} state that Villani's ''Cronica'' represented a departure from medieval chronicles in that a more modernistic approach was taken in describing events and [[statistics]], yet still medieval in that Villani relied on [[divine providence]] to explain the outcome of events.&lt;ref name="Bartlett, 35&amp;ndash;36"&gt;Bartlett, 35&amp;ndash;36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="green 161 165"&gt;Green, 161&amp;ndash;165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable passages==

===Battle of Montaperti, 1260===

In his Cronica, Villani writes that the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph defeat by the Ghibellines]] at [[Battle of Montaperti|Montaperti in 1260]] was a major setback to the historical progress of the Republic of Florence.&lt;ref name="olson 289"&gt;Olson, 289.&lt;/ref&gt; In this civil war, the Guelphs were a faction united with the [[Pope|papacy]] in Rome, while the Ghibellines were allied with the descendants of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire]] and supported by [[Siena]].&lt;ref name="olson 289"/&gt; According to Villani, the Florentine Guelphs' last stand was in defending the ''Carroccio'', a chariot which symbolized the independence of the [[Medieval commune|Commune of Florence]].&lt;ref name="olson 289"/&gt; Villani estimated that 2,500 Florentine troops were killed and 1,500 captured during the battle, which Roberta J.M. Olson states are conservative numbers in regards to subsequent historians writing of the battle's casualties.&lt;ref name="olson 289"/&gt;

===Florence Cathedral, 1296===
[[Image:CampanileGiotto-01.jpg|thumb|right|120px|[[Florence Cathedral]]]]
Villani describes the rebuilding of Florence after the 1293 rebellion of one Giano della Bella; he notes that by 1296 conditions were once again in a "tranquil state".&lt;ref name="bartlett 36"/&gt; He states that the citizens of Florence were discontented with the small stature of [[Florence Cathedral|their cathedral]], one that did not fit the greatness of their city, and so agreed in 1296 to expand and renew the building.&lt;ref name="bartlett 36"/&gt; A new foundation was laid in September of that year, adding new marble and sculptural figures.&lt;ref name="bartlett 36"/&gt; Villani mentions the cardinal legate sent by the Pope in Rome who laid the first stone of the foundation,&lt;ref name="bartlett 36"/&gt; a significant event since it was the first [[papal legate]] to visit Florence. Villani relates that for the construction of the church, it was required of the Commune of Florence that a subsidy of four ''denari'' on each libra be paid out of the city treasury in addition to a head-tax of two ''soldi'' for each adult male.&lt;ref name="bartlett 37"&gt;Bartlett, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 18, 1334, work began on the new ''[[campanile]]'' (bell tower) of the cathedral, the first stone placed by the bishop of Florence in front of an audience of clergy, priors, and other magistrates.&lt;ref name="bartlett 37"/&gt; Villani notes that the commune chose "our fellow-citizen [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]" as the designer of the tower, a man who was "the most sovereign master of painting in his time".&lt;ref name="bartlett 37"/&gt;

===Palazzo Vecchio, 1299===
[[Image:Firenze Palazzo della Signoria, better known as the Palazzo Vecchio.jpg|thumb|right|120px|[[Palazzo Vecchio]]]]
According to Villani, in 1299, the commune and people of Florence laid the foundation for the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], to replace the town hall that was located in a house behind the church of San Brocolo.&lt;ref name="bartlett 37"/&gt; The new Palazzo Vecchio was to serve as a protective municipal palace for the priors and magistrates, shielding them from the factional strife of the Guelphs and Ghibellines as well as the brawls between the people and magnates over the renewal of the priors every two months.&lt;ref name="bartlett 37"/&gt; The Uberti family houses had formerly stood at the location of the new ''[[piazza]]'', but the Uberti were "rebels of Florence and Ghibellines" and thus the plaza was intentionally laid upon the former location of their homes so they could never be rebuilt.&lt;ref name="bartlett 37"/&gt; According to Villani, the Uberti family was not even allowed to return to Florence.&lt;ref name="kleinhenz 1102"&gt;Kleinhenz, 1102.&lt;/ref&gt; In planning for the large expanse of the plaza, the commune of Florence purchased the homes of citizens such as the Foraboschi family, so that they could be demolished to make room for construction.&lt;ref name="bartlett 37"/&gt; In fact, the main tower of the Palazzo was built upon a previously existing tower of the Foraboschi family known as "La Vacca" or "The Cow".&lt;ref name="bartlett 37"/&gt;

===Trend of building country homes, early 14th century===
Villani boasts of Florence's pristine architecture in its monasteries and churches, as well as its ornate houses and beautiful palaces.&lt;ref name="spilner 459"&gt;Spilner, 459.&lt;/ref&gt; His opinion is clear even in the title of the chapter he devotes to this topic, "More on the greatness and status and magnificence of the city of Florence".&lt;ref name="spilner 459"/&gt; However, Villani is quick to add that those who spent too much on the lavish excesses of continuous remodelling and refurnishing of homes were sinners and could be "considered crazy because of their extravagant spending".&lt;ref name="spilner 459 460"&gt;Spilner, 459&amp;ndash;460.&lt;/ref&gt; Villani also describes the growing trend in the early 14th century of affluent Florentine citizens building large country homes far outside the walls of Florence, in the hills of [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldthwaite, 13, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Works sponsored by Robert of Naples, 1316===
While holding the ''[[signoria]]'' of Florence, [[Robert of Naples]] (1277&amp;ndash;1343) had the eastern part of the [[Bargello]] in Florence constructed, where he had his [[vicar]] the Count of Battifolle reside.&lt;ref name="elliott 516"&gt;Elliott, 516.&lt;/ref&gt; Villani writes in 1316 that Robert's vicar oversaw the construction of a large part of the new palace, which would suggest Robert's vicar had a great amount of influence in the construction of the eastern addition of the [[Bargello|Palazzo del Podestà]], including its Magdalen Chapel.&lt;ref name="elliott 516"/&gt;

===Famine of 1328===
[[Image:Talamone panorama top.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Talamone]], where the Florentines imported emergency food supplies from [[Sicily]] during the famine of 1347]]
There was a famine in 1328 which not only devastated Florence, but caused the people of [[Perugia]], [[Siena]], [[Lucca]], and [[Pistoia]] to turn away any beggars who approached their towns because they could not provide them with food.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, 38&amp;ndash;39.&lt;/ref&gt; Villani reports that Florence did not turn away beggars, but cared for anyone who approached the city and was in need of immediate subsistence.&lt;ref name="bartlett 39"/&gt; According to Villani, the Florentines sought grain from [[Sicily]], having it brought into port at [[Talamone]] and transporting all the way to Florence at great expense.&lt;ref name="bartlett 39"/&gt; Florence also sought aid and food supplies from [[Romagna]] and [[Arezzo]].&lt;ref name="bartlett 39"/&gt; Villani writes of the bread riots of the poor who could not afford a whole staio of wheat with their meager salaries:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...as long as the scarcity lasted, disregarding the heavy charge upon the public purse, it kept the price of the staio at half a gold florin [which would be two and a half times the normal figure] although to affect this reduction it permitted the wheat to be mixed to one-fourth its volume with coarser grain. In spite of all the government did, the agitation of the people at the market of Or San Michele was so great that it was necessary to protect the officials by means of guards fitted out with ax and block to punish rioters on the spot with the loss of hands or feet.&lt;ref name="bartlett 39"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Villani states that the commune of Florence spent more than 60,000 [[Italian coin florin|gold florins]] to mitigate this effects of this disaster.&lt;ref name="bartlett 39"/&gt; In order to save their own funds and calm the rage of the riotous poor, all the baker's ovens in the city were requisitioned by the commune and a loaf of bread weighing 170 g (6&amp;nbsp;oz) was then sold at a meager four pennies.&lt;ref name="bartlett 39"/&gt; This price was fixed in consideration that poor workers who made only eight to twelve pennies a day could now buy enough bread to survive.&lt;ref name="bartlett 39"/&gt;

Villani also describes in vivid detail the effects of another widespread famine in [[Tuscany]] during the year 1347, which killed an estimated 4,000 people in Florence a year before the Bubonic Plague.&lt;ref name="benedictow 286"/&gt;

===Fires of 1331 and 1332===
[[Image:Florence Ponte Veccio Vasari Corridor.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Ponte Vecchio]]]]
On June 23, 1331, a fire broke out toward the left bank of the [[Ponte Vecchio]] bridge, destroying all twenty shops located on the bridge.&lt;ref name="bartlett 38"&gt;Bartlett, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Villani notes that this was a heavy loss to local craftsmen of Florence, while two craftsman apprentices died in the fire.&lt;ref name="bartlett 38"/&gt; On September 12 of that same year a fire broke out at the household of the Soldanieri, killing six people in a house of carpenters and a blacksmith that was located near the church of Santa Trinità.&lt;ref name="bartlett 38"/&gt;

On February 28, 1332, a fire broke out in the palace of the [[podestà]], the leading magistrate of the city.&lt;ref name="bartlett 38"/&gt; This fire destroyed the roof of the palace and destroyed two-thirds of the entire structure from the ground floor up, prompting the government to rebuild the palatial residence totally out of stone, all the way up to the roof.&lt;ref name="bartlett 38"/&gt; On July 16 of that year the palace of the wool guild caught fire and everything from the ground floor up was destroyed, prompting the wool guild to reconstruct a new palatial residence on a larger scale and with stone [[vault (architecture)|vault]]s leading up to the roof.&lt;ref name="bartlett 38"/&gt;

===Flood of 1333===
[[Image:Baptisteriumganz.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Florence Baptistry]]]]
Villani states that by noon on Thursday, November 4, 1333, a flood along the [[Arno River]] spread across the entire plain of [[San Salvi]].&lt;ref name="bartlett 39"&gt;Bartlett, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that by nightfall the eastern wall of the city that was damming the water became damaged and then washed away in the flood, allowing the flood waters to breach and fill the city streets.&lt;ref name="bartlett 39"/&gt; He claims that the water rose above the altar in the [[Florence Baptistry]], reaching over half the height of the [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] columns.&lt;ref name="bartlett 39"/&gt; Bartlett notes that these columns, presented to Florence by the [[Pisa]]ns more than two hundred years before, have scratched lines to this day indicating the water level reached by the flood in 1333.&lt;ref name="bartlett 39"/&gt; Villani further claims that the height of the flood water in the courtyard of the commune's palace (residence of the podestà) reached 3&amp;nbsp;m (10&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name="bartlett 39"/&gt; The Carraia bridge collapsed with the exception of two of its arches, while the Trinità bridge collapsed except for one pier and one arch located towards the church of the Santa Trinità.&lt;ref name="bartlett 39 40"&gt;Bartlett, 39&amp;ndash;40.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ponte Vecchio—save the two central piers—was swept away when huge logs in the rushing water became clogged around the it, allowing the water to build and leap over the arches, states Villani.&lt;ref name="bartlett 40"&gt;Bartlett, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; There was an old statue of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] that stood on a pedestal near the Ponte Vecchio, but this too was taken by the flood along the Arno.&lt;ref name="bartlett 40"/&gt;

===Black Death of 1348===
[[Image:Bubonic plague map.PNG|thumb|Map showing the spread of [[bubonic plague]] in [[Europe]]]]
Villani describes how the plague of [[Black Death]] in 1348 was much more widespread amongst the inhabitants of [[Pistoia]], [[Prato]], [[Bologna]], [[Romagna]], [[Avignon]] and the whole of [[France]] than it was in [[Florence]] and [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref name="bartlett 38"/&gt; He notes that the Black Death also killed many more in [[Greece]], [[Turkey]] ([[Anatolia]]), in countries amongst the [[Tatars|Tartars]] and in places "beyond the sea", across the whole [[Levant]] and [[Mesopotamia]] in the areas of [[Syria]] and "[[Chaldea]]", as well as the islands of [[Cyprus]], [[Crete]], [[Rhodes]], [[Sicily]], [[Sardinia]], [[Corsica]], [[Elba]], and "from there soon reached all the shores of the mainland".&lt;ref name="bartlett 38"/&gt; Relating the course of events and the sailors from [[Genoa]] who brought the plague to mainland Europe, Villani writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And of eight Genoese galleys which had gone to the Black Sea only four returned, full of infected sailors, who were smitten one after the other on the return journey. And all who arrived at Genoa died, and they corrupted the air to such an extent that whoever came near the bodies died shortly after. And it was a disease in which there appeared certain swellings in the groin and under the armpit, and the victims spat blood, and in three days they were dead. And the priest who confessed the sick and those who nursed them so generally caught the infection that the victims were abandoned and deprived of confession, sacrament, medicine, and nursing. . .And many lands and cities were made desolate. And this plague lasted till. . .&lt;ref name="bartlett 38"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Villani was unable to complete this last sentence, since he himself died of the plague while writing the ''Cronica''.&lt;ref name="bartlett 38"/&gt;

==Municipal statistics==
[[File:Villani.png|thumb|A 14th-century illuminated manuscript version of the chronicle]]
Giovanni Villani recorded many statistics associated with the city of Florence. This included—but certainly wasn't limited to—figures such as 80 banks located in the city, 146 bakeries, 80 members in an association of city judges with 600 notaries, 60 some physicians and surgical doctors, and 100 some shops and dealers of spices.&lt;ref name="bartlett 42"/&gt; Each week the city consumed 13,200 [[bushel]]s of grain while the city annually consumed 4,000 oxen and calves, 60,000 mutton and sheep, 20,000 goats, and 30,000 pigs.&lt;ref name="bartlett 42"/&gt; He wrote that annually, in the month of July, some 4,000 melons were imported through Porta San Friano.&lt;ref name="bartlett 42"/&gt;

===Population===
Villani states that the whole population of Florence—men, women, and children—in reference to the years 1336 to 1338, was estimated to be 90,000 due to the amount of bread needed daily.&lt;ref name="bartlett 41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez 71"&gt;Lopez et al., 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Villani recorded an exact figure of 94,000 residents (which he says was very reliable data that included even the poor) in April 1347, a year before the Black Death.&lt;ref name="benedictow 286"&gt;Benedictow, 286.&lt;/ref&gt; A black bean was deposited for every male child baptized and a white bean deposited for every female child baptized in the Florence Baptistry—from these baptisms the average annual birth rate was figured at 5,500 to 6,000.&lt;ref name="bartlett 41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez 71 72"&gt;Lopez et al., 71&amp;ndash;72.&lt;/ref&gt; Villani pointed out that the newborn males often outnumbered the newborn females by 300 to 500 on each count.&lt;ref name="bartlett 41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez 72"&gt;Lopez et al., 72.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that in his day the adult, male citizen population of the city was about 25,000 (those between the age of fifteen and seventy who could bear arms); 1,500 of these were noble and upper class citizens.&lt;ref name="bartlett 41"&gt;Bartlett, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez 71"/&gt; Giovanni Villani stated that at all times there were about 1,500 foreigners, transients, and soldiers in the city.&lt;ref name="bartlett 41"/&gt;

===Education===
Besides population statistics, Villani also offered statistics on education. He wrote that boys and girls learning to read numbered 8,000 to 10,000 each year.&lt;ref name="bartlett 41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez 72"/&gt; There were 1,000 to 1,200 children learning to use the [[abacus]] and [[algorism]] for mathematics.&lt;ref name="bartlett 41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez 72"/&gt; In the four large, prestigious schools of Florence, there were always 550 to 600 students in attendance to learn proper grammar and [[Scholasticism|scholastic logic]].&lt;ref name="bartlett 41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez 72"/&gt;

===Religious facilities===
Villani also offered statistics on religious and health facilities. The total number of churches in Florence and its suburbs was 110—including 57 [[parish]]es, five [[abbey]]s with two priors and 80 monks each, 24 nunneries with some 500 women, 10 orders of [[friar]]s, and 30 hospitals with over 1,000 beds to offer to the sick and dying.&lt;ref name="bartlett 41"/&gt; Overall there were 250 to 350 [[chaplain]] priests in the city.&lt;ref name="bartlett 41"/&gt;

===Commerce and trade===
[[Image:Calimala - Arti 029.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Coat of arms]] for the ''[[Arte di Calimala]]'', the [[guild]] which Giovanni Villani belonged to]]
Besides religious facilities, Villani also provided information on commerce and trade. He states that there were about 200 workshops overseen by the ''[[Arte della Lana]]'' ([[guild]] of wool merchants and entrepreneurs in the woolen industry) of Florence.&lt;ref name="bartlett 41 42"&gt;Bartlett, 41&amp;ndash;42.&lt;/ref&gt; He states that these workshops produced some 70,000 to 80,000 pieces of cloth a year, with a total worth of 1,200,000 [[Italian coin florin|gold florins]].&lt;ref name="bartlett 41 42"/&gt; He states that a third of this sum "remained in the land" as a reward for labor, while 30,000 people lived from this sum of money.&lt;ref name="bartlett 42"&gt;Bartlett, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Giovanni notes that earlier in Florence there were actually 300 workshops producing 100,000 pieces of cloth annually, but these were of coarser quality and lesser value (before the importation and knowledge of [[Kingdom of England|English]] wool).&lt;ref name="bartlett 42"/&gt; Giovanni noted that the rise of the Florentine wool industry in the 13th century came about with this shift from producing a mass of cheap woolen products to high-margin luxury fabrics produced in limited qualities with high demand.&lt;ref name="kleinhenz 1170"&gt;Kleinhenz, 1170.&lt;/ref&gt;

The guild of the ''[[Arte di Calimala]]'' (importers, refinishers, and sellers of [[Kingdom of France|French]] and [[Gallia Narbonensis|Transalpine]] cloth) annually imported 10,000 pieces of cloth worth 300,000 gold florins; these were sold on the streets of Florence, while a large but unknown amount was exported back out of Florence.&lt;ref name="bartlett 42"/&gt; There was a large flux of international traders entering Florence, so much so that Villani states all attempts at creating market fairs in the early 14th century failed because "there always is a market in Florence."&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knights and the ordinances===
Villani states that there were only 75 full-dress knights in his day and not 250 knights as in the previous government of Florence, because the popular second government denied the magnates much of their authority and status, "hence few persons were knighted."&lt;ref name="bartlett 41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez 71"/&gt; In 1293, [[Ordinances of Justice|new city ordinances were passed]] that stated anyone who did not belong to a guild or a council of the captain of the people were to be barred from serving as priors, standard-bearers of justice, or judges.&lt;ref name="kleinhenz 799"&gt;Kleinhenz, 799.&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively excluded the powerful magnates of the city from holding important offices, while a prison for magnates was built in 1294, and Giovanni Villani writes that the first magnates punished for failing to adhere to these ordinances were the Galli.&lt;ref name="kleinhenz 799"/&gt;

==Legacy==

The ''Nuova Cronica'' by Villani stands as a milestone achievement in the history of European chronicles. Mark Phillips writes that Villani's account provided the basis for the historical works of [[Leonardo Bruni]] and [[Niccolò Machiavelli]].&lt;ref name="phillips 89"&gt;Phillips, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Villani's extensive work has also allowed for greater study of his contemporary [[Dante Alighieri]] by modern historians.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, 58&amp;ndash;59.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the ''Nuova Cronica'' also has its limitations, mostly with relying on inaccurate accounts of eras preceding its compilation. Earlier chronicles, such as the ''Chronica de origine civitatis'' of 1231, provided little substantive or factual material, relying instead on legendary accounts and not venturing to analyze their historicity or question their validity.&lt;ref&gt;Rubenstein, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Nicolai Rubinstein called Villani's chronicle a much more "mature expression" of validated Florentine history, yet Villani still relied on the ''Chronica de origine civitatis'' for covering events of Florence's earliest history; hence he adopted some of the highly questionable legendary accounts as true historical events.&lt;ref&gt;Rubenstein, 209  214.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Villani's work is most reliable when it comes to historical events that occurred within his lifetime, there are some factual errors even in the contemporary biographies he presented.&lt;ref name="Wicksteed, xxxi, xxxii, xxxiii"/&gt; [[Kenneth R. Bartlett]] writes that Villani's interest and elaboration in economic details, statistical information, and political and psychological insight signifies him as a more modern late medieval chronicler of Europe.&lt;ref name="Bartlett, 35&amp;ndash;36"/&gt; However, he adds that Villani's reliance upon [[divine providence]] aligned him more with the medieval tradition of chroniclers than the more credible historians of the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="bartlett 36"/&gt;

A '''photograph''' (also known as a '''photo''') is an [[image]] created by [[light]] falling on a [[photosensitivity|photosensitive]] surface, usually [[photographic film]] or an electronic [[image sensor]], such as a [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] or a [[active pixel sensor|CMOS]] chip. Most photographs are created using a [[camera]], which uses a [[photographic lens|lens]] to focus the scene's [[visible spectrum|visible wavelengths]] of light into a reproduction of what the [[human eye]] would see. The process and practice of creating such images is called [[photography]]. The word ''photograph'' was coined in 1839 by [[Sir John Herschel]] and is based on the [[Greek language|Greek]] φῶς (''[[:el:phos|phos]]''), meaning "light", and γραφή (''graphê''), meaning "drawing, writing", together meaning "drawing with light".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=photography&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher= |access-date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries have [[Photography and the law|laws]] against the production or distribution of certain types of photograph such as [[child pornography]].

==History==
{{Main article|History of photography}}
The first permanent photograph, a contact-exposed copy of an engraving, was made in 1822 using the [[Bitumen of Judea|bitumen]]-based "[[heliography]]" process developed by [[Nicéphore Niépce]]. The first photographs of a real-world scene, made using a [[camera obscura]], followed a few years later, but Niépce's process was not sensitive enough to be practical for that application: a camera [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] lasting for hours or days was required.&lt;ref name="utexas"&gt;{{cite web |title=The First Photograph - Heliography |url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/wfp/heliography.html |quote=from Helmut Gernsheim's article, "The 150th Anniversary of Photography," in History of Photography Vol. I, No. 1, January 1977: ... In 1822, Niépce coated a glass plate ... The sunlight passing through ... This first permanent example ... was destroyed ... some years later. |accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1829 Niépce entered into a partnership with [[Louis Daguerre]] and the two collaborated to work out a similar but more sensitive and otherwise improved process.

After Niépce's death in 1833, Daguerre concentrated on [[silver halide]]-based alternatives. He exposed a silver-plated copper sheet to iodine vapor, creating a layer of light-sensitive [[silver iodide]]; exposed it in the camera for a few minutes; developed the resulting invisible [[latent image]] to visibility with mercury fumes; then bathed the plate in a hot salt solution to remove the remaining silver iodide, making the results light-fast. He named this first practical process for making photographs with a camera the [[daguerreotype]], after himself. Its existence was announced to the world on 7 January 1839 but working details were not made public until 19 August. Other inventors soon made improvements which reduced the required exposure time from a few minutes to a few seconds, making portrait photography truly practical and widely popular.

The daguerreotype had shortcomings, notably the fragility of the mirror-like image surface and the particular viewing conditions required to see the image properly. Each was a unique opaque positive that could only be duplicated by copying it with a camera. Inventors set about working out improved processes that would be more practical. By the end of the 1850s the daguerreotype had been replaced by the less expensive and more easily viewed [[ambrotype]] and [[tintype]], which made use of the recently introduced [[collodion process]]. Glass plate collodion negatives used to make prints on [[Albumen print|albumen paper]] soon became the preferred photographic method and held that position for many years, even after the introduction of the more convenient [[gelatin process]] in 1871. Refinements of the gelatin process have remained the primary [[black-and-white]] photographic process to this day, differing primarily in the sensitivity of the [[photographic emulsion|emulsion]] and the support material used, which was originally glass, then a variety of [[film base|flexible plastic films]], along with various types of paper for the final prints.

Color photography is almost as old as black-and-white, with early experiments including [[John Herschel]]'s [[Anthotype]] prints in 1842, the pioneering work of [[Louis Ducos du Hauron]] in the 1860s, and the [[Lippmann plate|Lippmann process]] unveiled in 1891, but for many years color photography remained little more than a laboratory curiosity. It first became a widespread commercial reality with the introduction of [[Autochrome]] plates in 1907, but the plates were very expensive and not suitable for casual snapshot-taking with hand-held cameras. The mid-1930s saw the introduction of [[Kodachrome]] and [[Agfacolor|Agfacolor Neu]], the first easy-to-use color films of the modern multi-layer [[chromogenic]] type. These early processes produced transparencies for use in [[slide projector]]s and viewing devices, but color prints became increasingly popular after the introduction of chromogenic color print paper in the 1940s. The needs of the motion picture industry generated a number of special processes and systems, perhaps the best-known being the now-obsolete three-strip [[Technicolor]] process.

[[File:A Stream of Stars over Paranal.jpg|thumb|Long-exposure photograph of the [[Very Large Telescope]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Stream of Stars over Paranal|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1421a/|accessdate=27 May 2014|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Non-digital photographs are produced with a two-step chemical process.  In the two-step process the light-sensitive film captures a ''negative'' image (colors and lights/darks are inverted).  To produce a ''positive'' image, the negative is most commonly transferred ('[[Photographic printing|printed]]') onto [[photographic paper]]. Printing the negative onto transparent film stock is used to manufacture motion picture films.

Alternatively, the film is processed to invert the ''negative'' image, yielding positive [[Transparency (photography)|transparencies]].  Such positive images are usually mounted in frames, called slides. Before recent advances in digital photography, transparencies were widely used by professionals because of their sharpness and accuracy of color rendition. Most photographs published in magazines were taken on color transparency film.

Originally, all photographs were monochromatic or hand-painted in color. Although methods for developing color photos were available as early as 1861, they did not become widely available until the 1940s or 1950s, and even so, until the 1960s most photographs were taken in black and white. Since then, [[color photography]] has dominated popular photography, although black and white is still used, being easier to develop than color.

[[Panoramic format]] images can be taken with cameras like the [[Hasselblad]] Xpan on standard film. Since the 1990s, panoramic photos have been available on the [[Advanced Photo System]] (APS) film. APS was developed by several of the major film manufacturers to provide a film with different formats and computerized options available, though APS panoramas were created using a mask in panorama-capable cameras, far less desirable than a true panoramic camera, which achieves its effect through a wider film format. APS has become less popular and has been discontinued.

The advent of the [[microcomputer]] and [[digital photograph]]y has led to the rise of [[Digital printing|digital prints]]. These prints are created from stored [[Graphics file format|graphic formats]] such as [[JPEG]], [[TIFF]], and [[Raw image format|RAW]]. The types of printers used include [[inkjet printer]]s, [[dye-sublimation printer]], [[laser printer]]s, and [[thermal printer]]s. Inkjet prints are sometimes given the coined name "[[Giclée]]".

The [[World Wide Web|Web]] has been a popular medium for storing and sharing photos ever since the first photograph was published on the web by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] in 1992 (an image of the [[CERN]] house band [[Les Horribles Cernettes]]). Today popular sites such as [[Flickr]], [[Picasa]], [[PhotoBucket]] and [[500px]] are used by millions of people to share their pictures.

==Preservation==

===Paper folders===
Ideal photograph storage involves placing each photo in an individual folder constructed from buffered, or [[acid-free paper]].&lt;ref name="Albright" /&gt;  Buffered paper folders are especially recommended in cases when a photograph was previously mounted onto poor quality material or using an [[adhesive]] that will lead to even more [[acid]] creation.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, Debbie Hess. "Caring for Your Photographic Collections." Library of Congress.  Feb. 9 2008, [https://www.loc.gov/preserv/care/photo.html LOC.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;  Store photographs measuring 8x10 inches or smaller vertically along the longer edge of the photo in the buffered paper folder, within a larger archival box, and label each folder with relevant information to identify it.  The rigid nature of the folder protects the photo from slumping or creasing, as long as the box is not packed too tightly or under filled. Folder larger photos or [[brittleness|brittle]] photos stacked flat within archival boxes with other materials of comparable size.&lt;ref&gt;"How Should I Store my Photographic Prints?"  Preservation and Archives Professionals.  The National Archives and Records Administration. 9 February 2008, [https://www.archives.gov/preservation/family-archives/storing-photos.html Archives.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polyester enclosures===
The most stable of plastics used in photo preservation, [[polyester]], does not generate any harmful chemical elements, but nor does it have any capability to absorb [[acids]] generated by the photograph itself.  Polyester sleeves and encapsulation have been praised for their ability to protect the photograph from [[humidity]] and environmental [[pollutants|pollution]], slowing the reaction between the item and the atmosphere.  This is true, however the polyester just as frequently traps these elements next to the material it is intended to protect.  This is especially risky in a storage environment that experiences drastic fluctuations in humidity or temperature, leading to ferrotyping, or sticking of the photograph to the plastic.&lt;ref name="Albright" /&gt;  Photographs sleeved or encapsulated in polyester cannot be stored vertically in boxes because they will slide down next to each other within the box, bending and folding, nor can the [[archivist]] write directly onto the polyester to identify the photograph. Therefore, it is necessary to either stack polyester protected photographs horizontally within a box, or bind them in a three ring binder.  Stacking the photos horizontally within a flat box will greatly reduce ease of access, and binders leave three sides of the photo exposed to the effects of light&lt;ref name="IOS"&gt;International Organization for Standardization.  ISO 18902:2001(E).  [[Geneva, Switzerland]]: [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] Office, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and do not support the photograph evenly on both sides, leading to slumping and bending within the binder.  The plastic used for enclosures has been manufactured to be as frictionless as possible to prevent scratching photos during insertion to the sleeves.  Unfortunately, the slippery nature of the enclosure generates a build-up of [[static electricity]], which attracts [[dust]] and lint particles.  The static can attract the dust to the inside of the sleeve, as well, where it can scratch the photograph.&lt;ref name="Albright" /&gt;  Likewise, these components that aid in insertion of the photo, referred to as slip agents, can break down and transfer from the plastic to the photograph, where they deposit as an oily film, attracting further lint and dust.  At this time, there is no test to evaluate the long-term effects of these components on photographs.  In addition, the plastic sleeves can develop kinks or creases in the surface, which will scratch away at the [[emulsion]] during handling.&lt;ref name="IOS" /&gt;

===Handling and care===
It is best to leave photographs lying flat on the table when viewing them.  Do not pick it up from a corner, or even from two sides and hold it at eye level.  Every time the photograph bends, even a little, this can break down the [[emulsion]].&lt;ref&gt;Baggett, James L.  "Handle with Care: Photos."  Alabama Librarian.
54.1 (2004): 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  The very nature of enclosing a photograph in plastic encourages users to pick it up; users tend to handle plastic enclosed photographs less gently than non-enclosed photographs, simply because they feel the plastic enclosure makes the photo impervious to all mishandling.  As long as a photo is in its folder, there is no need to touch it; simply remove the folder from the box, lay it flat on the table, and open the folder.  If for some reason the researcher or [[archivist]] does need to handle the actual photo, perhaps to examine the [[recto and verso|verso]] for writing, he or she can use gloves if there appears to be a risk from oils or dirt on the hands.

==Myths and beliefs==
{{see also|Aniconism}}
Because [[daguerreotype]]s were rendered on a mirrored surface, many [[spiritualist]]s also became practitioners of the new art form.  Spiritualists would claim that the human image on the mirrored surface was akin to looking into one's soul.  The spiritualists also believed that it would open their souls and let demons in. Among Muslims, it is [[makruh]] (offensive) to perform [[salah]] (worship) in a place decorated with photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rizvi|first1=Sayyid|title=Your Questions Answered|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photography and darkroom anomalies and artifacts sometimes lead viewers to believe that spirits or demons have been captured in photos. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/photos-that-arent-paranormal-4123060|title=Photos That AREN'T Paranormal|author=|date=|website=thoughtco.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Piraeus Apollo''' is an archaic-style bronze dating from the 6th century BC, possibly  from the years 530–520 BC, exhibited now at the [[Archaeological Museum of Piraeus]] ([[Athens]]). Apollo was the god of the ideal order and balance and the depictions of naked young men in the [[Kouros]] (young male) type are believed to be representations of the god. This bronze statue seems to be the last stage in the development of the formal almost static [[Kouros]] type that survived for a long time from the [[Archaic period in Greece|early Archaic period]] (640–580 BC).

[[File:7266 - Piraeus Arch. Museum, Athens - The Piraeus Apollo - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 14 2009.jpg|thumb|left|140px| Head of ''Piraeus Apollo'']]

Originally the Kouros type represented the archaic-thought that nature expresses itself in ideal everlasting simple-forms which can be traced by the senses and depicted in a way of illusive-reality. Matter was not regarded lifeless but something full of life, in an almost [[animistic]] belief. These ideas seem to go parallel with the natural- philosophical conceptions of [[Thales]] from [[Miletus]] who searched a simple material-form behind the appearances of the things and also believed that matter was alive (υλοζωϊσμός). This material character is paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of blooming life through unnaturally simplified forms.&lt;ref&gt;E.Homman,Wedeking.Transl.J.R.Foster (1968).''Art of the world-Archaic Greece''. Methuen-London pp.63-65&lt;/ref&gt;

The Piraeus Apollo is a product of the [[Archaic period in Greece|late archaic period]] (530–480 BC) in which the Greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create an harmonious whole. It is among the very few such bronzes that have survived. The statue seems to differentiate from the previous formality and represents a kind of motion. The symmetry and the analogies of the members are closer to the post-archaic sculpture which gives more emphasis not to the ''illusive reality'' but to the analogy and the interaction of each member with the others in the whole. In the last few decades of the 6th century, the philosophical mystic currents were to have a considerable influence on late archaic art. The logical move from [[Ionia]]n natural philosophy to metaphysics was the conscious decision of post-archaic mind.&lt;ref&gt;E.Homman,Wedeking. Transl.J.R.Foster (1968).''Art of the world-Archaic Greece.''Methuen-London pp.194-196&lt;/ref&gt; In post-archaic period, the illusive imaginative reality was displaced by harmony and symmetry.

The method of interaction and analogy was perfected  by [[Polykleitos]] in [[classical Greece|classical period]]. He used the principle of continuity and in his famous sculptures each member transmitted to the next a part of his existence; therefore there was an harmonious analogy with the rest of the parts. It seems that his [[Aesthetic canon|canon]] (κανών:norm, standard) was a standardization which in his opinion led to the ''ideal form''. He was probably influenced by the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory of [[Pythagoras]] who believed that behind each object  there was a mathematical relation that led to order and balance.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Spivey (1997).''Greek Art''. Phaidon Press Ltd. pp.196-198&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the perfect mathematical relation was a continuous attempt of the Greek  architects.

The Greek belief of ''ideal forms'' was later extended by [[Plato]] in his metaphysical theory of forms (''ideai'':ideas). The Greek word ''idea'' (ιδέα:idea) has the same roots with the words ''idein'' (ιδείν:to see), ''eidos'' (είδος:species), and probably with ''oida'' (οίδα:know), therefore one must see something in order to know it. Originally, the words were applied to such obvious forms as the human body. The transference of the words from visible to invisible show how the Greek mind moved from the gift of senses to the principles behind them which were also used in the art of sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;C,M.Bowra (1957).''The Greek experience''.W.P.Company. Cleveland and New York. p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

{{US 2016 presidential elections series}}
In March 2016, the personal [[Gmail]] account of [[John Podesta]], a former [[White House chief of staff]] and the chairman of [[Hillary Clinton]]'s [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential campaign]], was compromised in a [[data breach]], and a collection of his emails, many of which were work-related, were stolen. [[Cybersecurity]] researchers as well as the United States government attributed responsibility for the breach, which was accomplished via a [[spear-phishing]] attack, to the hacking group [[Fancy Bear]], allegedly affiliated with [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Russian intelligence services]].&lt;ref name="Motherboard"/&gt;

Some or all of the '''Podesta emails''' were subsequently obtained by [[WikiLeaks]], which published over 20,000 pages of emails, allegedly from Podesta, in October and November 2016.&lt;ref name="SteinVox"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/20/13308108/wikileaks-podesta-hillary-clinton |title=What 20,000 pages of hacked WikiLeaks emails teach us about Hillary Clinton |last=Stein |first=Jeff |newspaper=Vox |access-date=October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Podesta and the Clinton campaign have declined to authenticate the emails.&lt;ref name="CBS slogans tpp"/&gt; Cybersecurity experts interviewed by [[PolitiFact]] believe the majority of emails are probably unaltered, while stating it is possible that the hackers inserted at least some doctored or fabricated emails into the collection. The article then attests that the Clinton campaign, however, has yet to produce any evidence that any specific emails in the latest leak were fraudulent.&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite web |last=Carroll |first=Lauren |url=https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/oct/23/are-clinton-wikileaks-emails-doctored-or-are-they-/ |title=Are the Clinton WikiLeaks emails doctored, or are they authentic? |publisher=PolitiFact |date=October 23, 2016 |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent investigation by U.S. intelligence agencies also reported that the files obtained by WikiLeaks during the U.S. election contained no "evident forgeries".&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Greg |last2=Entous |first2=Adam |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/intelligence-chiefs-expected-in-new-york-to-brief-trump-on-russian-hacking/2017/01/06/5f591416-d41a-11e6-9cb0-54ab630851e8_story.html |title=Declassified report says Putin 'ordered' effort to undermine faith in U.S. election and help Trump |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 6, 2017 |accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from the Atlanta-based [[cybersecurity]] firm [[SecureWorks|Dell SecureWorks]] reported that the emails had been obtained through a [[Data breach|data theft]] carried out by the hacker group [[Fancy Bear]], a group of [[Russian Intelligence Community|Russian intelligence]]-linked hackers that were also responsible for [[cyberwarfare by Russia|cyberattacks]] that [[Democratic National Committee cyber attacks|targeted the Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) and [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (DCCC), resulting in WikiLeaks publishing emails from those hacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Geller |first=Eric |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/russia-responsible-podesta-wikileaks-hack-230095 |title=Russian hackers infiltrated Podesta's email, security firm says |work=Politico |date=October 20, 2016 |accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PerlrothShear"&gt;{{cite news |last=Perlroth |first=Nicole |last2=Shear |first2=Michael D. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/us/private-security-group-says-russia-was-behind-john-podestas-email-hack.html |title=Private Security Group Says Russia Was Behind John Podesta's Email Hack |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SecureWorks concluded Fancy Bear had sent Podesta an email on March 19, 2016, that had the appearance of a Google security alert, but actually contained a misleading link&amp;mdash;a strategy known as [[spear-phishing]]. (This tactic has also been used by hackers to break into the accounts of other notable persons, such as [[Colin Powell]]).

SecureWorks had tracked the activities of Fancy Bear for more than a year before the [[cyberattack]], and in June 2016 had reported the group made use of malicious Bitly links and fake Google login pages to trick targets into divulging their passwords.&lt;ref name="PerlrothShear"/&gt; However, the hackers left some of their Bitly accounts public, allowing SecureWorks to trace many of their links to e-mail accounts targeted with spear-phishing attacks.&lt;ref name="PerlrothShear"/&gt; Of this list of targeted accounts, more than one hundred were policy advisors to Clinton, or members of her presidential campaign, and by June, twenty staff members had clicked on the phishing links.&lt;ref name="PerlrothShear"/&gt;

On December 9, 2016, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] told U.S. legislators the [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. Intelligence Community]] concluded [[Russian involvement in the 2016 United States presidential election|the Russian government was behind]] the hack and gave [[WikiLeaks]] hacked emails from John Podesta.&lt;ref name=secretcia&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html |accessdate=December 10, 2016 |date=December 9, 2016 |title=Secret CIA assessment says Russia was trying to help Trump win White House |author=Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima and Greg Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ciareportrussiatrump&gt;{{cite news  |first1=Chris |last1=Sanchez |first2=Bryan |last2=Logan |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=December 9, 2016 |accessdate=August 13, 2018 |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/cia-russia-helped-trump-win-us-election-2016-12 |title=The CIA says it has evidence that Russia tried to help Trump win the US election}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=russiahelpeddonald&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Sommerfeldt |work=[[New York Daily News]] |url=https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/russia-helped-donald-trump-win-white-house-report-article-1.2905442 |title=Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the White House: report |date=December 9, 2016 |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A declassified report by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), and [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) noted that, "Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity. Disclosures through WikiLeaks did not contain any evident forgeries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf |title=Background to "Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections": The Analytic Process and Cyber Incident Attribution |publisher=Office of the [[Director of National Intelligence]] |p=3 |date=January 6, 2017 |accessdate=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dilanian |first=Ken |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/report-putin-russia-tried-help-trump-discrediting-clinton-n703981 |title=Report: Putin, Russia Tried to Help Trump By 'Discrediting' Clinton |publisher=[[NBC News]] |date=January 6, 2017 |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apnews.com/ccb4c5c0f8a849958b7a7f4fdf6e2834 |title=Highlights From DNI Report on Russia and Election Hacking |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=January 6, 2017 |accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cybersecurity experts interviewed by [[PolitiFact]] believe that while most of the emails are probably unaltered, it is possible the hackers inserted some doctored or fabricated material into the collection.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

[[Jeffrey Carr]], CEO of the cybersecurity company Taia Global, stated: "I've looked at a lot of document dumps provided by hacker groups over the years, and in almost every case you can find a few altered or entirely falsified documents. But only a few. The vast majority were genuine. I believe that's the case with the Podesta emails, as well."&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; Jamie Winterton of the [[Arizona State University]] Global Security Initiative stated, "I would be shocked if the emails weren't altered," noting the longstanding Russian practice of promoting [[disinformation]].&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

Cybersecurity expert Robert Graham described the contents of some of the emails as authentic by using the [[DomainKeys Identified Mail]] (DKIM) contained in these emails' signatures.&lt;ref name="Fox News"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/24/tech-blogger-finds-proof-dnc-chiefs-emails-werent-doctored-despite-claims.html |title=Tech blogger finds proof DNC chief's emails weren't 'doctored' despite claims |publisher=Fox News |date=October 24, 2016 |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all of the emails have these keys in their signature, and thus could not be verified with this method.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

On October 7, 2016, 30 minutes after the Access Hollywood tape was first published, [[WikiLeaks]] began publishing thousands of emails from Podesta's Gmail account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sharockman |first=Aaron |url=https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/18/john-podesta/its-true-wikileaks-dumped-podesta-emails-hour-afte/ |title=It's True: WikiLeaks dumped Podesta emails hour after Trump video surfaced |work=PolitiFact |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout October, WikiLeaks released installments of these emails on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sankin |first=Aaron |url=https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/ecuador-statement-assange-internet-access/ |title=Ecuador Says It Cut Julian Assange's Internet Access For Trying to Influence U.S. Election |date=October 18, 2016 |work=The Daily Dot |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 18, 2016, John Podesta stated in ''[[Meet the Press]]'' that the FBI had contacted him about the leaked emails on October 9, 2016, but had not contacted him since.&lt;ref name=MeetthePress&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnstone |first=Liz |title=John Podesta: FBI Spoke to Me Only Once About My Hacked Emails |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/john-podesta-fbi-spoke-me-only-once-about-my-hacked-n697511 |publisher=NBC News |date=December 18, 2016 |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinton's Wall Street speeches ===
One of the emails contained 25 excerpts from Clinton's paid [[Wall Street]] speeches that a staffer had flagged as politically problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goldman |first=Julianna |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/podesta-emails-show-excerpts-of-clinton-speeches-to-goldman/ |title=Podesta emails show excerpts of Clinton speeches to Goldman |date=October 7, 2016 |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gearan |first1=Anne |last2=Wagner |first2=John |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clintons-wall-street-remarks-are-tempered-by-time-supporters-say/2016/10/08/d903d838-8d8d-11e6-bff0-d53f592f176e_story.html |title=Clinton's Wall Street remarks are tempered by time, supporters say |date=October 8, 2016 |work=Washington Post |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the October 2016 presidential debate, Clinton voiced her support for a "no-fly" zone in Syria. In a 2013 speech, Clinton had discussed the difficulties involved. In particular, she noted that in order to establish a no-fly zone, Syria's air defenses would need to be destroyed. Because the Assad government had located these anti-aircraft batteries in populated civilian areas, their destruction would cause many collateral civilian deaths.&lt;ref name=InterceptSyria&gt;[https://theintercept.com/2016/10/10/in-secret-goldman-sachs-speech-hillary-clinton-admitted-no-fly-zone-would-kill-a-lot-of-syrians/ In Secret Goldman Sachs Speech, Hillary Clinton Admitted No-Fly Zone Would “Kill a Lot of Syrians"]. Jiliani, Zaid.

The excerpts came up in two of the [[United States presidential election debates, 2016|presidential debates]] between Clinton and Trump. In one of the debates, the moderator [[Martha Raddatz]] quoted an excerpt saying that politicians "need both a public and a private position" and asked Clinton if it was okay for politicians to be "two-faced". Clinton replied, "As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called ''[[Lincoln (film)|Lincoln]]''. It was a master class watching president Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th amendment, it was principled and strategic. I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fernholz |first=Tim |url=https://qz.com/805005/the-leaked-email-behind-hillary-clintons-mid-debate-reference-to-steven-spielbergs-abraham-lincoln-biopic/ |title=The leaked email behind Hillary Clinton's mid-debate reference to Steven Spielberg's Abraham Lincoln biopic |work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |date=October 9, 2016 |accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third presidential debate, the moderator [[Chris Wallace]] quoted a speech excerpt where Clinton says, "My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders," and asked if she was for [[open borders]]. Clinton replied, "If you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy. We trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined. And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pierce |first=Charles P. |url=https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a49877/friday-rule-less-election-more-dylan/ |title=New Friday Rule: Less Election, More Dylan |date=October 21, 2016 |work=Esquire |accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sherman |first=Amy |url=https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/19/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-wants-have-open-/ |title=Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton wants to have open borders |work=PolitiFact |date=October 19, 2016 |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discussions of Catholic religious activities===
[[Sandy Newman]] wrote to Podesta: "I have not thought at all about how one would 'plant the seeds of the revolution', or who would plant them."&lt;ref name=podestaemail-wapo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/10/12/wikileaks-emails-show-clinton-spokeswoman-joking-about-catholics-and-evangelicals |title=WikiLeaks emails appear to show Clinton spokeswoman joking about Catholics and evangelicals |first=Sarah |last=Pulliam Bailey |work=Washington Post |accessdate=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Podesta agreed that this was necessary to do as Newman suggested and wrote back to note that they had created groups like [[Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good]] and [[Catholics United]] to push for a more progressive approach to the faith, change would "have to be bottom up".&lt;ref name="podestaemail-wapo"/&gt;&lt;ref name=podestaemail-catholicherald&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2016/10/12/clinton-campaign-chief-helped-start-catholic-organisations-to-create-revolution-in-the-church |title=Clinton campaign chief helped start Catholic organisations to create a 'revolution' in the Church |work=Catholic Herald |accessdate=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=podestaemail-Times&gt;{{cite web |first=Elizabeth |last=Dias |url=http://time.com/4528532/hillary-clinton-campaign-pushes-back-on-anti-catholic-charge |title=Hillary Clinton Campaign Pushes Back on 'Anti-Catholic' Charge |work=Time |accessdate=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond Arroyo]] responded: "It makes it seem like you're creating organizations to change the core beliefs of the church," he said.&lt;ref name="podestaemail-wapo"/&gt; "For someone to come and say, 'I have a political organization to change your church to complete my political agenda or advance my agenda', I don't know how anybody could embrace that."&lt;ref name="podestaemail-wapo"/&gt; Professor [[Robert P.

The leak revealed an email sent by John Halpin, a senior fellow at the [[Center for American Progress]]. The email discussed conservative media mogul [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s decision to raise his kids in the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=podestabbc1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37639370 |title=14 revelations from Wikileaks' hacked Clinton emails |first=Reporter |last=Staff |publisher=BBC |accessdate=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, "Many of the most powerful elements of the conservative movement are all Catholic (many converts) ...

=== Presidential debate questions shared by Donna Brazile ===
On October 11, 2016, WikiLeaks released the text of an email sent by [[Donna Brazile]] on March 12, 2016, to Clinton communications director [[Jennifer Palmieri]] with the subject header "From time to time I get questions in advance."

Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]]." At a debate in Flint the following day, a woman whose "son had developed a rash from the [[Flint water crisis|contaminated water]]" asked Clinton: "If elected president, what course will you take to regain my trust in government?"

==Reaction==
Sociology professor [[Zeynep Tufekci]] criticized how WikiLeaks handled the release of these emails, writing, "Taking one campaign manager's email account and releasing it with zero curation in the last month of an election needs to be treated as what it is: political sabotage, not whistle-blowing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tufekci |first=Zeynep |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/05/opinion/what-were-missing-while-we-obsess-over-john-podestas-email.html |title=WikiLeaks Isn't Whistleblowing |work=The New York Times |date=November 4, 2016 |accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glen Caplin, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said, "By dribbling these out every day WikiLeaks is proving they are nothing but a propaganda arm of the Kremlin with a political agenda doing [Vladimir] Putin's dirty work to help elect Donald Trump."&lt;ref name="Politico 80 pages"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cheney |first=Kyle |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/hillary-clinton-wall-street-speeches-podesta-emails-229689 |title=Hacked 80-page roundup of paid speeches shows Clinton 'praising Wall Street' |work=Politico |date=October 12, 2016 |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to comment on the emails release, president Vladimir Putin replied that Russia was being falsely accused. He said, "The hysteria is merely caused by the fact that somebody needs to divert the attention of the American people from the essence of what was exposed by the hackers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-emails.html |title=Donald Trump Finds Improbable Ally in WikiLeaks |last=Healy |first=Patrick |date=October 12, 2016 |last2=David E. |first2=Sanger |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |issn=0362-4331 |last3=Haberman |first3=Maggie |access-date=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/15/cia-reportedly-preparing-major-cyber-assault-against-russia-in-wake-hack-attacks.html |title=CIA Reportedly Preparing Major Cyber Assault Against Russia In Wake Of Hack Attacks |date=October 15, 2016 |newspaper=[[Fox News]] |language=en-US|access-date=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American public's interest in WikiLeaks in October roughly coincided with a tightening presidential race between Trump and Clinton. According to an analysis of opinion polling by Harry Enten of ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'', the release of the emails roughly matched Clinton's decline in the polls, though it did not seem to have an effect on public perceptions of her trustworthiness. Enten concluded that WikiLeaks' activities were "among the factors that might have contributed to [Clinton's] loss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Enten |first=Harry |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/wikileaks-hillary-clinton/ |title=How Much Did Wikileaks Hurt Hillary Clinton? |date=December 23, 2016 |work=FiveThirtyEight |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an op-ed for ''The Intercept'', [[James Risen]] criticized the media for its reporting on emails, arguing that the hacking of the emails was a more significant story than the content of the emails themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Risen |first=James |url=https://theintercept.com/2018/02/16/trump-russia-election-hacking-investigation/ |title=Is Donald Trump a Traitor? |date=February 16, 2018 |website=The Intercept |access-date=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Frank]], writing in an editorial column for ''The Guardian'', argued that the emails gave an "unprecedented view into the workings of the elite, and how it looks after itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Frank |first=Thomas |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/31/the-podesta-emails-show-who-runs-america-and-how-they-do-it |title=Forget the FBI cache; the Podesta emails show how America is run |date=October 31, 2016 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=March 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1203">'''''R v U (FJ)''''' is a leading case of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. In the decision the court modified the requirements of admissibility of [[Prior consistent statements and prior inconsistent statements|prior statements]].
In ''[[R v B (KG)]]'', the court required that prior statements can only be admitted for the truth of its contents where it was under [[oath]] and videotaped. In UFJ, the court permitted a less strict standard. The [[complainant]]s prior statement was admitted for the truth of its contents without being under oath or videotaped where the statement was corroborated by the accused confession. The enhanced reliability of the corroboration and the opportunity to [[cross-examine]] the recanting witness was sufficient to remove much of the dangers associated with prior statements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1111">The '''Sinosphere''' is the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]]. The linguist [[James Matisoff]] coined the term "Sinosphere" in 1990, contrasting with the [[Indosphere]], "I refer to the Chinese and Indian areas of linguistic/cultural influence in Southeast Asia as the 'Sinosphere' and the 'Indosphere'."&lt;ref&gt;Matisoff, James A. (1990). [http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~bjoseph/Ling611/Lx611Matisoff1990.pdf On Megalocomparison]. ''Language'' 66.1, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) the term has been glossed as "Sinosphere: a socio-political sphere of MSEA, subsuming those countries, cultures, and languages that have historically come under influence from the politics, culture, religion, and languages of China ."&lt;ref&gt;N.J.

{{Expand Spanish|Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación (México)|date=November 2010}}
{{Politics of Mexico}}

The '''National Supreme Court of Justice''' ({{lang-es|Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación}} ('''SCJN''') is the Mexican institution serving as the country's federal [[high court]] and the spearhead organisation for the judiciary of the Mexican Federal Government. It consists of eleven [[magistrates]], known as ''ministers of the court'', one of whom is designated the court's ''president''.

Judges of the SCJN are appointed for 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;Article 94 Mexican Constitution&lt;/ref&gt; They are ratified through affirmation by the [[Mexican Senate|Senate]] from a list proposed by the [[President of Mexico|President of the Republic]]. The ministers chosen will select from among themselves who shall be the President of the Court to serve a four-year period; any given minister may serve out more than one term as president, but may not do so consecutively. 

==Requirements for holding a seat on the National Supreme Court of Justice==
* Be a natural born citizen of Mexico.
* Be at least 35 years old at the time of one's appointment
* Have held a Law degree for at least 10 years.
* To have a good reputation and have not have been convicted of theft, fraud, forgery, breach of trust, or any other offense which could imply a punishment of more than one year in prison.
* Not have been Director for Domestic Affairs, Chief of an Administrative Department, Attorney General of the Republic or Federal District Attorney, Senator, Member of Parliament, Governor of any State, or Chief Executive of the Federal District during the year prior to his or her appointment.

The Constitution requires that the appointment of ministers of the court should fall to those persons who have served ably, effectively and honourably in the administration of justice, or to those who have distinguished themselves by their honor, competence and professional background in the exercise of their duties.

Ministers may take leave of their posts for three reasons:
* The end of their terms
* Relinquishment, which is only allowed in serious cases, all of which must be affirmed by the President and accepted or discarded by the Senate.
* Voluntary retirement: Proceeds when the interested party requests their retirement, as long as they meet the conditions of age and seniority.

==Supreme Court building==

The court itself is located just off the [[Zocalo|main plaza]] of [[Mexico City]] on the corners of Pino Suarez and Carranza Streets. It was built between 1935 and 1941 by Antonio Muñoz Garcia. Prior to the [[Conquest of Mexico|Conquest]], this site was reserved for the ritual known as "[[Danza de los Voladores de Papantla|Dance of the Flyers]]" which is still practiced today in [[Papantla]]. [[Hernán Cortés]] claimed the property after the Conquest and its ownership was in dispute during much of the colonial period with Cortes' heirs, the city government, and the [[Royal and Pontifical University]] all claiming rights. It was also the site of a very large market known as El Volador.&lt;ref name="historic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico City Historic Center |last= Galindo |first=Carmen |authorlink= |author2=Magdalena Galindo   |year=2002 |publisher=Ediciones Nueva Guia |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-5437-29-7 |url= |page=60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the building, there are four flanks painted in 1941 by [[José Clemente Orozco]], two of which are named ''The Social Labor Movement'' and ''Commonwealth''. There is also a mural done by American artist [[George Biddle]] entitled "War and Peace" at the entrance to the law library.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; The building also contains a mural by [[Rafael Cauduro]], which "graphically illustrates the Gran Guignol of Mexican torture",&lt;ref name=ross/&gt; and includes a depiction of the 1968 [[Tlatelolco massacre]] as well as "a cut-away of a prison, perhaps the infamous Lecumberri Black Palace where student leaders who escaped death were jailed."&lt;ref name=ross&gt;John Ross, ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 16 July 2010, [http://www.counterpunch.org/jross07162010.html In the Basement of Mexican Justice, No One is Innocent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719120301/http://www.counterpunch.org/jross07162010.html |date=19 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3932">The '''tag URI scheme''' is a [[uniform resource identifier|uniform resource identifier (URI)]] scheme for [[unique identifier]]s called '''tags''', defined by RFC 4151 in October 2005.&lt;ref name=RFC4151&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4151|title=The 'tag' URI Scheme|author1-first=T.|author1-last=Kindberg|author2-first=S.|author2-last=Hawke|date=October 2005|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]]|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="main"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tag URI|url=http://www.taguri.org/|accessdate=2007-11-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RFC identifies four requirements for tags:&lt;ref name=RFC4151/&gt;
* Identifiers are likely to be unique across space and time, and come from a practically inexhaustible supply.
* Identifiers are relatively convenient for humans to mint (create), read, type, remember etc.
* No central registration is necessary, at least for holders of domain names or email addresses; and there is negligible cost to mint each new identifier.
* The identifiers are independent of any particular resolution scheme.

Tags are used extensively in [[YAML]].&lt;ref name="yaml_spec"&gt;{{cite web|title=YAML specification
|url = http://www.yaml.org/spec/current.html|accessdate=2007-11-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format ==
The general syntax of a tag URI is:&lt;ref name=RFC4151/&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;"tag:" authorityName "," YYYY-MM-DD-date ":" specific [ "#" fragment ]&lt;/pre&gt;

In this syntax, the &lt;code&gt;authorityName&lt;/code&gt; is either a [[domain name]] or an [[email address]],
and the date is in the [[YYYY-MM-DD]] format, such as &lt;code&gt;2017-01-01&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, a specific tag is tied to a specific domain name or email address at a specific point of time. It is required that the "tagging entity" creating the tag be in control of the specified domain or email address as of 00:00 [[UTC]] on the specified date. This requirement makes each tag globally and persistently unique. The authority name alone would not suffice for global uniqueness, since the ownership of domains and email addresses is subject to change.

The date used in a tag may be a past date, provided the tagging entity controlled the authority name on that past date. An entity which acquires control of an authority name immediately after a period when it was unassigned is allowed to mint tags as if it controlled the authority name during the unassigned period, provided the entity has evidence that the name was unassigned.  The date used in a newly-minted tag may not be a date in the future.

The date may be abbreviated; the month and day default to &lt;code&gt;01&lt;/code&gt;, but tags which have defaulted month and day values are reckoned as different from tags where the &lt;code&gt;01&lt;/code&gt; value is specified.  Thus,

* &lt;code&gt;tag:example.com,2004:1234&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;tag:example.com,2004-01:1234&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;tag:example.com,2004-01-01:1234&lt;/code&gt;

are all different tags and might have different referents. They all should have been
minted by the same tagging entity (specifically, whoever controlled example.com on January 1, 2004 00:00 UTC).  If a different entity gained control of example.com at 00:05 UTC on that date, it would not
be allowed to mint tags until the following date, and it would not ever be able to use the abbreviated forms, &lt;code&gt;2004&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;2004-01&lt;/code&gt;.

Examples of tag URIs are:
* &lt;code&gt;tag:timothy@hpl.hp.com,2001:web/externalHome&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;tag:sandro@w3.org,2004-05:Sandro&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;tag:my-ids.com,2001-09-15:TimKindberg:presentations:UBath2004-05-19&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-555&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;tag:yaml.org,2002:int#section1&lt;/code&gt;

The '''''Taiping Guangji''''' ({{zh|t=太平廣記|s=太平广记|p=Tàipíng Guǎngjì}}), sometimes translated as the ''Extensive Records of the Taiping Era'', or ''Extensive Records of the Taiping Xinguo Period'', is a collection of stories compiled in the early [[Song dynasty]] under imperial direction by [[Li Fang (Song dynasty)|Li Fang]]. The work was completed in 978 and printing blocks were cut but it was prevented from publication on the grounds that it contained only ''xiaoshuo'' (fiction or "insignificant tellings") and thus "was of no use to young students." It survived in manuscript until it was published in the [[Ming dynasty]].{{sfnb|Idema|1997| p = 56-57}} It is considered one of the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]''.

The collection is divided into 500 volumes ({{zh|c=卷|hp=Juǎn|labels=no}}) and consists of about 3 million [[Chinese characters]]. It includes about seven thousand stories selected from over three hundred books and novels from the [[Han dynasty]] to the early [[Song dynasty]], many of which have been lost. Some stories are historical or naturalistic anecdotes, each is replete with historical elements, and were not regarded by their authors as [[fiction]], but the topics are mostly [[supernatural]], about [[Buddhist priest|Buddhist]] and [[Taoist priest]]s, [[immortality|immortals]], [[Chinese ghosts|ghosts]], and various [[deities]]. They include a number of [[Tang dynasty]] stories, especially [[chuanqi]] (tales of wonder), that are famous works of literature in their own right, and also inspired later works. {{sfnb|Idema|1997| p = 56-57}}

[[Pu Songling]] was said to have been inspired by ''Taiping Guangji''; the short story "[[A Sequel to the Yellow Millet Dream]]" parallels one of ''Taiping''{{'s}} stories.

'''''The Battle of Anghiari''''' (1505) is a lost painting by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], at times referred to as "The Lost Leonardo", which some commentators believe to be still hidden beneath one of the later [[frescoes]] in the [[Palazzo Vecchio#Salone dei Cinquecento|Salone dei Cinquecento]] (Hall of the Five Hundred) in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], [[Florence]]. Its central scene depicted four men riding raging [[war horse]]s engaged in a battle for possession of a [[Heraldic standard#Standard|standard]], at the [[Battle of Anghiari (1440)|Battle of Anghiari]] in 1440.

Many preparatory studies by Leonardo still exist. The composition of the central section is best known through a drawing by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] in the [[Louvre]], [[Paris]]. This work, dating from 1603 and known as ''The Battle of the Standard'', was based on an engraving of 1553 by [[Lorenzo Zacchia]], which was taken from the painting itself or possibly derived from a [[Modello|cartoon]] by Leonardo. Rubens succeeded in portraying the fury, the intense emotions and the sense of power that were presumably present in the original painting. Similarities have been noted between this ''Battle of Anghiari'' and the ''[[Hippopotamus Hunt]]'' painted by Rubens in 1616.

In March 2012, it was announced that a team led by [[Maurizio Seracini]] has found evidence that the painting still exists on a hidden inner wall behind a cavity, underneath a section of [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]]'s fresco in the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/12/art-historians-hidden-leonardo-da-vinci | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Tom | last=Kington | title=Art historians say they have found evidence of hidden Leonardo da Vinci | date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The search was discontinued in September 2012, without any further progress having been made, due to conflict among the involved parties.&lt;ref name="dnews"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.discovery.com/history/leonardo-da-vinci-mystery-lost-masterpiece-battle-of-anghiari-120922.htm | location=London | work=Discovery News | first=Rosella | last=Lorenzi | title=Search for Mysterious Lost Da Vinci Aborted | date=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - Study of Two Warriors' Heads for the Battle of Anghiari - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''Study of Two Warriors’ Heads for The Battle of Anghiari'' ({{circa|1504–5}}). Black chalk or charcoal, some traces of red chalk on paper, 19.1 × 18.8 cm. [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], Budapest]]

[[File:Leonardo da vinci, Battle of Anghiari (Tavola Doria).jpg|thumb|right|A copy possibly made from the original incomplete work]]
In 1504 Leonardo da Vinci was given the commission by [[Gonfaloniere of Justice|gonfaloniere]] [[Piero Soderini]], a contract signed by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], to decorate the Hall of Five Hundred. At the same time his rival [[Michelangelo]], who had just finished his ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', was designated the opposite wall.  This was the only time that Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo worked together on the same project.  The painting of Michelangelo depicted an episode from the [[Battle of Cascina (Michelangelo)|Battle of Cascina]], when a group of bathing soldiers was surprised by the enemy. However Michelangelo did not stay in Florence long enough to complete the project. He was able to finish his cartoon, but only began the painting. He was invited back to Rome in 1505 by the newly appointed [[Pope Julius II]] and was commissioned to build the [[list of papal tombs|Pope's tomb]].

Leonardo da Vinci drew his large cartoon in the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella]], on the east wall, depicting a scene from the life of [[Niccolò Piccinino]], a [[condottiere]] in the service of duke [[Filippo Maria Visconti]] of Milan. He drew a scene of a violent clash of horses and a furious battle of men fighting for the flag in the Battle of Anghiari. [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his book ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'' praised the magisterial way in which Leonardo had put this scene on paper:

{{quotation|It would be impossible to express the inventiveness of Leonardo's design for the soldiers' uniforms, which he sketched in all their variety, or the crests of the helmets and other ornaments, not to mention the incredible skill he demonstrated in the shape and features of the horses, which Leonardo, better than any other master, created with their boldness, muscles and graceful beauty.}}

Leonardo built an ingenious scaffold in the Hall of Five Hundred that could be raised or folded in the manner of an [[accordion]]. This painting was to be his largest and most substantial work. Since he had a bad experience with [[fresco]] painting (''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]''; refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie, Milan), he wanted to apply oil colours on the wall. He began also to experiment with such a thick undercoat (possibly mingled with wax), that after he applied the colours, the paint began to drip. Trying to dry the painting in a hurry and save whatever he could, he hung large charcoal [[brazier]]s close to the painting. Only the lower part could be saved in an intact state, the upper part couldn't dry fast enough and the colours intermingled. Leonardo then abandoned the project.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Michelangelo's and Leonardo's unfinished paintings adorned the same room together for almost a decade (1505–1512). The cartoon of Michelangelo's painting was cut in pieces by [[Bartolommeo Bandinelli]] out of jealousy in 1512. The centerpiece of ''The Battle of Anghiari'' was greatly admired and numerous copies were made for decades.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Reconstruction of room==
During the mid-16th century (1555–1572), the hall was enlarged and restructured by Vasari and his helpers, on the instructions of Grand Duke [[Cosimo I]]; in order that the Duke could hold court in this important chamber of the palace.  In the course of the renovations, the remnants of famous (but unfinished) artworks from the previous plan of decoration for the hall, were lost; including ''The Battle of Cascina'' by Michelangelo and ''The Battle of Anghiari'' by Leonardo da Vinci.

Vasari himself painted new frescoes on the now-extended walls. On the walls are large and expansive frescoes that depict battles and military victories by Florence over [[Pisa]] and [[Siena]] :
*''The Taking of Siena''
*''The Conquest of Porto Ercole''
*''The Victory of Cosimo I at Marciano in Val di Chiana''
*''Defeat of the Pisans at the Tower of San Vincenzo''
*''Maximillian of Austria Attempts the Conquest of Leghorn''
*''Pisa Attacked by the Florentine Troops''

==Possible rediscovery==
[[File:Palazzo Vecchio - grand hall.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palazzo Vecchio]], where it is believed the painting may be concealed]]

[[Maurizio Seracini]], an Italian expert in high-technology art analysis, believes that Leonardo's ''Anghiari'' is hidden behind one of the mural ''Battle of Marciano in Val di Chiana'' (1563) painted by Vasari. In the upper part of Vasari's fresco, 12 meters above the ground, a [[Florence|Florentine]] soldier waves a green flag with the words "Cerca trova" ("He who seeks, finds"). These enigmatic words are suggested to be a hint from Vasari, who had praised ''The Battle of Anghiari'' highly in his writings, incomplete and damaged as it was.

Seracini believes it is unlikely that Vasari would have willingly destroyed da Vinci's work. Vasari's concealment and preservation of another painting, [[Masaccio]]'s ''[[Holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'', during a subsequent renovation project also assigned to him by Cosimo I, is cited as precedent.

Using non-invasive techniques, such as a high-frequency, surface-penetrating radar and a thermographic camera, Seracini made a survey of the hall. Among other findings, he discovered that Vasari had built a curtain wall in front of the original east wall, and painted his fresco on the new wall.  Seracini believes the original fresco of Leonardo da Vinci to be located on the older wall, beneath it. Sensors found a gap of 1 to 3 centimeters between the two walls, large enough for the older fresco to be preserved.

In early 2007, the city council of Florence and the Italian Minister of Culture gave the [[green-light|green light]] for further investigation. After unsuccessful attempts to fund the development of a more advanced non-invasive scanning system, in December 2011 Seracini and his associates drilled small holes through areas of the Vasari fresco believed to have been previously damaged and restored, hence no longer comprising "original paint" from Vasari's work.  An endoscopic probe with a camera was extended into the cavity behind the curtain wall, and the team discovered fragments of pigment and indications of fresco surfacing on the plaster of the inner wall; samples were taken at the time, with the results being announced publicly on 12 March 2012. Seracini believes that this is conclusive evidence for the continued existence of da Vinci's fresco. Seracini's research is highly controversial with strong criticism being levelled against him for drilling the holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Data Support Theory on Location of Lost Leonardo da Vinci Painting |url=http://press.nationalgeographic.com/pressroom/index.jsp?pageID=pressReleases_detail&amp;siteID=1&amp;cid=1331556733225 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012 researchers said "the material found behind the Vasari wall shows a chemical composition similar to black pigment found in brown glazes on Leonardo's Mona Lisa and St. John the Baptist, identified in a recently published scientific paper by the Louvre, which analyzed all the da Vinci paintings in its collection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lost Leonardo Da- Vinci battle scene sparks row between art historians |first=Tom |last=Kington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/dec/05/lost-leonardo-da-vinci-scene?INTCMP=SRCH |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=6 December 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, it was reported that research efforts to investigate the cavity behind Vasari's fresco have been discontinued, due to the conflicting views of interested parties, as to whether and how to proceed.&lt;ref name="dnews" /&gt;

Continuing the heated debate among Italian art scholars and historians, in December 2012 the scholars Alfonso Musci and Alessandro Savorelli, both opponents of Seracini's hypothesis, published an article in the journal of the Italian Institute of Renaissance Studies at [[Palazzo Strozzi]], disputing his interpretation of the motto on the green flag in Vasari's mural. In the [https://www.academia.edu/8835382/A_Musci_A_Savorelli_Giorgio_Vasari_cerca_trova._La_storia_dietro_il_dipinto article] they attempted to investigate the writing “CERCA TROVA” in the context of the real events that occurred during the Battle of Scannagallo (1554) and made known through the works of {{Interlanguage link multi|Bernardo Segni|it}}, Antonio {{Interlanguage link multi|Ramirez de Montalvo|it}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Domenico Moreni|it}}.

These works contain detailed descriptions of anti-Medicean heraldic insignia present in Marciano della Chiana, including eight green flags embroidered with the verse of [[Dante]]: "{{Interlanguage link multi|Libertà va cercando, ch'è sì cara|it}}, ch'è sì cara come sa chi per lei vita rifiuta" ({{Interlanguage link multi|Purgatorio , vv. 70–72|it|3=Purgatorio – Canto primo}}) and the ancient coat of arms "[[Libertas]]" in golden. These banners had been delivered by [[Henry II of France]] to the troops of the Florentine exiles, armed by the Republican banker [[Bindo Altoviti]] and led by [[Piero Strozzi]] and [[Giambattista Altoviti]]. After the defeat of the Republicans and of the French troops, these green flags would have become spoils of the winners, and handed over to Grand Duke [[Cosimo I]].  They would have been publicly displayed in the central nave of the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|Basilica of San Lorenzo]].

Following the theme of luck and damnation of the oldest Florentine 'stemma' ([[Libertas]]) in the cycle of paintings conceived by the Grand Duke [[Cosimo I]] and [[Vincenzo Borghini]] in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Salone dei Cinquecento|it}}, Musci and Savorelli suggest that the motto "CERCA TROVA" was an allusion to the verse of Dante and to the unfortunate fate of the Republicans ("searching freedom and finding death"), and thereby dispute Seracini's interpretation of the green flag as a hint left by Vasari, of the location and fate of da Vinci's painting.

However, the article does not address questions about the discovery of pigment and evidence of paintwork found in the cavity behind Vasari's mural.

==Understanding the Book==
Scholars{{who|date=September 2015}} have generally found this book difficult to understand. It has also been suggested{{according to whom|date=September 2015}} that it is better to begin by understanding some of the following articles written by [[S.N.

==Review==

In this “ground-breaking work … SN Balagangadhara … wrote a devastating critique of the very language we use today to describe religious phenomena in India. In his book … Balagangadhara questioned whether it is appropriate to use terms like "religion", "orthodoxy" and "Hinduism" at all. He asked whether what are essentially Christian categories may be imputed to non-Western systems of belief and practice without utterly misunderstanding their content and misrepresenting their function."&lt;ref&gt;"The Hindus: a celebration of religious variety", The National staff, 31 Jul 2009 [http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/books/the-hindus-a-celebration-of-religious-variety#page2]&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic thesis that this book presents, "that Hinduism does not exist", it has been pointed out, "will alter our notion of Indian culture and social structure fundamentally. This seemingly pulls the carpet out from under the feet of the caste studies. ... [But] it does not leave the caste studies reeling helplessly.Rather,it provides a strong conceptual foundation and shows new directions to caste studies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jalki|first1=Dunkin|title=New Directions to the Caste Studies: Contributions of S.N. Balagangadhara’s Smriti-Vismriti|journal=Journal of Karnataka Studies|volume=5|issue=2|pages=160–161|url=http://journalofkarnatakastudies.org/new-directions-to-the-caste-studies-contributions-of-s-n-balagangadharas-smriti-vismriti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the Kannada translation of the work claims that Balagangadhara's book has "prompted an intellectual revolution of sorts and those who have engaged with the questions he raises in the book cannot escape engaging with the answers he provides as well. To put it strongly — any scholar in the field of cultural studies and its related disciplines, will have to respond to his work. ... It traces the history of the two encounters of European culture with other cultures and empirically shows that the existence of religion was assumed both these times. It argues that the ‘universality of religion' is a falsifiable assumption and that religion is not a cultural universal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kannan|first=Sushumna|title=Meaningful encounter|url=http://hindu.com/fr/2010/12/31/stories/2010123150740200.htm|work=The Hindu|accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tower Bridge''' is a combined [[bascule bridge|bascule]] and [[suspended-deck suspension bridge|suspension bridge]] in [[London]] built between 1886 and 1894. The bridge crosses the [[River Thames]] close to the [[Tower of London]] and has become an iconic symbol of London. Because of this, Tower Bridge is sometimes confused with [[London Bridge]], situated some {{convert|0.5|mi|abbr=on}} upstream. Tower Bridge is one of five London bridges now owned and maintained by the [[Bridge House Estates]], a charitable trust overseen by the [[City of London Corporation]]. It is the only one of the Trust's bridges not to connect the City of London directly to the Southwark bank, as its northern landfall is in [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]].

The bridge consists of two [[bridge tower]]s tied together at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal [[Tension (physics)|tension]] forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical components of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers. The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower. Before its restoration in the 2010s, the bridge's colour scheme dated from 1977, when it was painted red, white and blue for [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]]. Its colours were subsequently restored to blue and white.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thetowerbridge.info/diary/tower-bridge-restored-to-true-colours.html|title=Tower Bridge restored to true colours {{!}} Tower Bridge|website=www.thetowerbridge.info|access-date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thetowerbridge.info/diary/finishing-touches-to-tower-bridge.html|title=Finishing touches to Tower Bridge {{!}} Tower Bridge|website=www.thetowerbridge.info|access-date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition, for which an admission charge is made.

== History ==

=== Inception ===
[[File:Tower bridge schm020.png|thumb|right|Elevation, with dimensions]]
In the second half of the 19th century, an advertisement in the [[East End of London]] led to a hiring for a new river crossing downstream of [[London Bridge]]. A traditional fixed bridge at street level could not be built because it would cut off access by [[sailing ships]] to the port facilities in the [[Pool of London]], between London Bridge and the Tower of London.

A ''Special Bridge or Subway Committee'' was formed in 1877, chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman, to find a solution to the river crossing problem. Over 50 designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir [[Joseph Bazalgette]]. Bazalgette's design was rejected because of a lack of sufficient headroom, and design was not approved until 1884, when it was decided to build a [[bascule bridge]]. Sir [[John Wolfe Barry]] was appointed engineer with Sir [[Horace Jones (architect)|Horace Jones]] as architect{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=922}}  (who was also one of the judges).&lt;ref name="Roberts1"&gt;Roberts, Chris, "Cross River Traffic", Granta, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; An Act of Parliament was passed in 1885 authorising the bridge's construction. It specified the opening span must give a clear width of {{convert|61|m|ft|0|order=flip}} and a headroom of {{convert|41|m|ft|0|order=flip}}. Construction had to be in a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=922}}

Barry designed a bascule bridge with two [[bridge tower]]s built on piers. The central [[Span (architecture)|span]] was split into two equal bascules or leaves, which could be raised to allow river traffic to pass. The two side-spans were suspension bridges, with the suspension rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridge's upper walkways.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=922}}

=== Construction ===
[[File:Tower bridge works 1892.jpg|right|thumb|Tower Bridge under construction, 1892]]
Construction started in 1886 and took eight years with five major contractors – [[John Jackson (UK politician)|Sir John Jackson]] (foundations), [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|Baron Armstrong]] (hydraulics), [[William Webster (builder)|William Webster]], Sir [[Herbert Bartlett|H.H. Bartlett]], and [[Sir William Arrol &amp; Co.]]&lt;ref&gt;[[The Times]], 2 July 1894&lt;/ref&gt; – and employed 432 construction workers. E W Crutwell was the resident engineer for the construction.&lt;ref name=Archive3 /&gt;

Two massive piers, containing over 70,000 tons of concrete,&lt;ref name="Roberts1" /&gt; were sunk into the riverbed to support the construction. Over 11,000 tons of steel provided the framework for the towers and walkways.&lt;ref name="Roberts1" /&gt; This was then clad in [[Cornwall|Cornish]] [[granite]] and [[Portland stone]], both to protect the underlying steelwork and to give the bridge a pleasing appearance.

Jones died in 1886 and George D. Stevenson took over the project.&lt;ref name="Roberts1" /&gt; Stevenson replaced Jones's original brick façade with the more ornate [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] style, which makes the bridge a distinctive landmark, and was intended to harmonise the bridge with the nearby [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref name=Archive3 /&gt; The total cost of construction was £1,184,000&lt;ref name=Archive3 /&gt; (equivalent to £{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|1184000|1894|{{inflation-year|UK}}|r=-4}}}} in {{inflation-year|UK}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}

=== Opening ===
[[File:Opening of Tower Bridge 1895.jpg|thumb|right|1895 portrait of the opening of Tower Bridge, [[William Lionel Wyllie]]]]
The bridge was officially opened on 30 June 1894 by the then [[Prince of Wales]] (the future [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]]), and his wife, The Princess of Wales ([[Alexandra of Denmark]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = John Eade |url = http://thames.me.uk/s00040.htm |title = Where Thames Smooth Waters Glide |publisher = Thames.me.uk |date = 22 July 1976 |accessdate = 13 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bridge connected Iron Gate, on the north bank of the river, with {{Not a typo|Horselydown}} Lane, on the south – now known as Tower Bridge Approach and [[Tower Bridge Road]], respectively.&lt;ref name=Archive3 /&gt; Until the bridge was opened, the [[Tower Subway]] – 400&amp;nbsp;m to the west – was the shortest way to cross the river from [[Tower Hill]] to [[Tooley Street]] in [[Southwark]]. Opened in 1870, Tower Subway was among the world's earliest underground ("tube") railways, but it closed after just three months and was re-opened as a pedestrian foot tunnel. Once Tower Bridge was open, the majority of foot traffic transferred to using the bridge, there being no toll to pay to use it. Having lost most of its income, the tunnel was closed in 1898.&lt;ref name="DSmith"&gt;{{cite book |last = Smith |first = Denis |title = Civil Engineering Heritage: London and the Thames Valley |publisher = Thomas Telford |year = 2001 |pages = 22–23 |isbn = 0-7277-2876-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--this ref was obtained from the relevant section of [[Tower Subway]] and covers this detail; however, I haven't seen the original to double-check this. - EdJogg--&gt;

The high-level open air walkways between the towers gained an unpleasant reputation as a haunt for prostitutes and [[pickpocketing|pickpockets]]; as they were only accessible by stairs they were seldom used by regular pedestrians, and were closed in 1910.&lt;ref name="walkway"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tower Bridge: fascinating facts and figures|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/london/south-east/london-bridge/articles/Tower-Bridge-fascinating-facts-and-figures/|agency=The Telegraph|date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The walkway reopened in 1982.&lt;ref name="walkway"/&gt;

During the [[Second World War]] and as a precaution against the existing engines being damaged by enemy action, a third engine was installed in 1942: a 150&amp;nbsp;[[horsepower|hp]] horizontal cross-compound engine, built by [[Vickers Armstrong Ltd.]] at their Elswick works in Newcastle upon Tyne. It was fitted with a [[flywheel]] having a {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter and weighing 9 tons, and was governed to a speed of 30 rpm. The engine became redundant when the rest of the system was modernised in 1974, and was donated to the [[Forncett Industrial Steam Museum]] by the Corporation of the City of London.&lt;ref name="Forncett"&gt;{{cite web |title = The Tower Bridge Engine |publisher = Forncett Industrial Steam Museum |url = http://oldenginehouse.users.btopenworld.com/towerb.htm |accessdate = 27 February 2007 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100225024729/http://oldenginehouse.users.btopenworld.com/towerb.htm |archivedate = 25 February 2010 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modernisation ===
In 1974, the original operating mechanism was largely replaced by a new electro-hydraulic drive system, designed by BHA Cromwell House, with the original final pinions driven by modern [[hydraulic motor]]s and gearing. In 1982, the Tower Bridge Exhibition opened, housed in the bridge's twin towers, the long-closed high-level walkways and the Victorian engine rooms. The latter still house the original steam engines and some of the original [[hydraulic machinery]].&lt;ref name=gbhmod&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.arbitrator-engineer-gbh.co.uk/#!firm/c1n8o |title = The Firm: BHA Cromwell House |publisher = G.

A computer system was installed in 2000 to control the raising and lowering of the bascules remotely. It proved unreliable, resulting in the bridge being stuck in the open or closed positions on several occasions during 2005 until its sensors were replaced.&lt;ref name=BBCstickFix /&gt;

=== 2008–2012 facelift ===
[[File:Tower Bridge - Thames Night Long Exposure 01.jpg|thumb|left|Tower Bridge with LED lighting]]
In April 2008 it was announced that the bridge would undergo a 'facelift' costing £4&amp;nbsp;million, and taking four years to complete. The work entailed stripping off the existing paint down to bare metal and repainting in blue and white.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Each section was enshrouded in scaffolding and plastic sheeting to prevent the old paint falling into the Thames and causing pollution. Starting in mid-2008, contractors worked on a quarter of the bridge at a time to minimise disruption, but some road closures were inevitable. It is intended that the completed work will stand for 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Tower Bridge to get £4m facelift |publisher = BBC News |date = 7 April 2008 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7335380.stm |accessdate = 8 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renovation of the walkway interior was completed in mid-2009. Within the walkways a versatile new lighting system has been installed, designed by Eleni Shiarlis, for when the walkways are in use for exhibitions or functions. The new system provides for both feature and atmospheric lighting, the latter using bespoke [[RGB LED]] [[luminaire]]s, designed to be concealed within the bridge superstructure and fixed without the need for drilling (these requirements as a result of the bridge's Grade I status).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Tower Bridge lighting |work = Interior Event &amp; Exhibition Lighting Design scheme |publisher = ES Lighting Design |date = 29 April 2009 |url = http://www.eslightingdesign.co.uk/commercial/london-tower-bridge.aspx |accessdate = 27 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renovation of the four suspension chains was completed in March 2010 using a state-of-the-art coating system requiring up to six different layers of 'paint'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Tower Bridge restored to true colours |url = http://www.thetowerbridge.info/diary/tower-bridge-restored-to-true-colours |publisher = Tower Bridge Restoration Website |accessdate = 24 May 2010 |date = 10 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics ===
[[File:Chithrubar.jpg|thumb|Tower Bridge with Olympic Rings during the [[2012 London Olympics]]]]
The bridge featured in publicity for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] being held in London. In June 2012 a set of Olympic rings was suspended from the bridge to mark one month to go until the start of the games. The rings cost £259,817 to make, measured {{convert|25|by|11.5|m|ft}} and weighed {{convert|13|t|ST}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2165518/London-2012-Olympics-Rings-unveiled-Tower-Bridge.html Olympics rings Tower over London, ''Daily Mail'' (London), accessed 29 July 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 2012, the west walkway was transformed into a {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} Live Music Sculpture by the British composer Samuel Bordoli. 30 classical musicians were arranged along the length of the bridge {{convert|42|m|ft|0|order=flip}} above the Thames behind the Olympic rings. The sound travelled backwards and forwards along the walkway, echoing the structure of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.classicfm.com/music-news/latest-news/tower-bridge-londons-latest-venue/ |title = Tower Bridge is London's Latest Venue – Classic FM Music News and Features |publisher = Classicfm.com |date =  |accessdate = 28 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.classical-music.com/news/tower-bridge-musical-instrument |title = Tower Bridge as a musical instrument |publisher = Classical-Music.com |date =  |accessdate = 28 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Olympics, the rings were removed from Tower Bridge and replaced by the [[Paralympic symbols#Current|emblem]] of the [[Paralympic Games]] for the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]].&lt;ref name=guardian-paraprep&gt;{{cite news |title = London 2012: let the Paralympics preparations begin |url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/13/london-2012-paralympic-preparations-begin?newsfeed=true |work = The Guardian |location = London |accessdate = 18 August 2012 |first = Alexandra |last = Topping |date = 13 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 renovations ===

Tower Bridge was closed to all road traffic for almost three months in late 2016 (1 October to 30 December).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://tfl.gov.uk/status-updates/major-works-and-events/tower-bridge-closure |title = Tower Bridge closure |publisher = Transport for London |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161011071655/https://tfl.gov.uk/status-updates/major-works-and-events/tower-bridge-closure |archivedate = 11 October 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was to allow structural maintenance work to take place.  The work included:
* Undertaking major maintenance to the bridge lifting systems
* Replacing the decking and resurfacing the walkways and road
* Replacing the expansion joints along the bridge to provide a smoother surface
* Waterproofing the arches made from brick on the approaches to the bridge

During this time the bridge was still open to water borne traffic as required by Act of Parliament. The bridge was open to pedestrians for all but three weekends, where a free ferry service was in operation.

== Design ==
[[File:Tower Bridge from Shad Thames.jpg|thumb|right|Tower Bridge from Shad Thames]]

=== Bridge structure ===
[[File:Tower Bridge at Dawn.jpg|thumb|Tower Bridge at dawn]]
The bridge is {{convert|800|ft|m}} in length with two towers each {{convert|213|ft|m}} high, built on piers. The central span of {{convert|200|ft|m}} between the towers is split into two equal bascules or leaves, which can be raised to an angle of 86 degrees to allow river traffic to pass. The bascules, weighing over 1,000 tons each, are counterbalanced to minimise the force required and allow raising in five minutes.

The two side-spans are suspension bridges, each {{convert|270|ft|m|0}} long, with the suspension rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridge's upper walkways. The pedestrian walkways are {{convert|143|ft|m|0}} above the river at high tide.&lt;ref name=Archive3&gt;{{cite journal |title = Tower Bridge |journal = Archive – the Quarterly Journal for British Industrial and Transport History |volume = &lt;!--1--&gt; |issue = 3 |page = 47 |year = 1994 |publisher = Lightmoor Press |issn = 1352-7991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main bridge deck carries two lanes of road traffic between two low-level pedestrian walkways across both suspension spans and the opening bascule section of the bridge, with the walkways separated from the roadway by fences. The roadway passes through each of the two towers, whereas the low-level walkways pass around the outside of the towers.

One of the chimneys on the bridge, which are often mistaken for lamp posts, connects up to an old fireplace in a guardroom of the Tower of London. It is long-disused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://londonist.com/2015/10/hiding-in-plain-site#gallery=2133548,2133553 |work = Londonist |title = 11 Secret Features Of Famous London Landmarks |date = 20 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydraulic system ===
[[File:Tower.bridge.99.machinery.london.arp.jpg|thumb|One of the original steam engines]]
The original raising mechanism was powered by pressurised water stored in several [[hydraulic accumulator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.towerbridge.org.uk/TBE/EN/BridgeHistory/ |title = Bridge History |publisher = Towerbridge.org.uk |date = 1 February 2003 |accessdate = 13 June 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120620160843/http://www.towerbridge.org.uk/TBE/EN/BridgeHistory |archivedate = 20 June 2012 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was designed and installed by [[Hamilton Owen Rendel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Lane |first = MR |title = The Rendel Connection: a dynasty of engineers |year = 1989 |publisher = Quiller press, London |isbn = 1-870948-01-7 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; while working for [[Armstrong, Mitchell and Company|Sir W. G. Armstrong Mitchell &amp; Company]] of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Water, at a pressure of {{convert|750|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}, was pumped into the accumulators by two {{convert|360|hp|kW|abbr=on}} horizontal twin-tandem compound [[stationary steam engine]]s, fitted with Meyer expansion slide valves. Each engine drove a force pump from its piston tail rod. The accumulators each comprise a {{convert|20|in|cm|adj=on}} ram on which sits a very heavy weight to maintain the desired pressure.

The entire hydraulic system along with the gas lighting system was installed by William Sugg &amp; Co Ltd., the well known Westminster gas engineers. The gas lighting was initially by open flame burners within the lanterns but soon after was updated to the later incandescent system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.williamsugghistory.co.uk |title = History William Sugg &amp; Co Westminster gas lighting cooking heating appliance manufacturer. |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the original operating mechanism was largely replaced by a new electro-hydraulic drive system, designed by [[BHA Cromwell House]].&lt;ref name=gbhmod /&gt; The only components of the original system still in use are the final pinions, which engage with the racks fitted to the bascules. These are driven by modern [[hydraulic motor]]s and gearing, using oil rather than water as the [[hydraulic fluid]].&lt;ref name=hartwell /&gt; Some of the original [[hydraulic machinery]] has been retained, although it is no longer in use. It is open to the public and forms the basis for the bridge's museum, which resides in the old engine rooms on the south side of the bridge. The museum includes the steam engines, two of the accumulators and one of the hydraulic engines that moved the bascules, along with other related artefacts.

=== Signalling and control ===
To control the passage of river traffic through the bridge, a number of different rules and signals were employed. Daytime control was provided by red [[semaphore signal]]s, mounted on small control cabins on either end of both bridge piers. At night, coloured lights were used, in either direction, on both piers: two red lights to show that the bridge was closed, and two green to show that it was open. In foggy weather, a gong was sounded as well.&lt;ref name=Archive3 /&gt;

Vessels passing through the bridge had to display signals too: by day, a black ball at least {{convert|2|ft|m|2}} in diameter was to be mounted high up where it could be seen; by night, two red lights in the same position. Foggy weather required repeated blasts from the ship's [[steam whistle]]. If a black ball was suspended from the middle of each walkway (or a red light at night) this indicated that the bridge could not be opened. These signals were repeated about {{convert|1000|yd|m}} downstream, at [[Cherry Garden Pier]], where boats needing to pass through the bridge had to hoist their signals/lights and sound their horn, as appropriate, to alert the Bridge Master.&lt;ref name=Archive3 /&gt;

Some of the control mechanism for the signalling equipment has been preserved and may be seen working in the bridge's museum.

=== Road ===
Tower Bridge is still a busy crossing of the Thames: it is crossed by over 40,000 people (motorists, cyclists and pedestrians) every day.&lt;ref name=BBCstickFix&gt;{{cite news |title = Fix to stop bridge getting stuck |publisher = BBC News |date = 17 January 2006 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4620622.stm |accessdate = 25 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge is on the [[London Inner Ring Road]], and is on the eastern boundary of the [[London congestion charge]] zone. (Drivers do not incur a charge by crossing the bridge.)

To maintain the integrity of the structure, the [[City of London Corporation]] has imposed a {{convert|20|mph|km/h|0|adj=on}} speed restriction, and an {{convert|18|t|ST|adj=on}} weight limit on vehicles using the bridge. A camera system measures the speed of traffic crossing the bridge, using a [[vehicle registration plate|number plate]] recognition system to send [[Fixed Penalty Notice|fixed penalty charges]] to speeding drivers.&lt;ref name=tbspeedcheck&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.speedcheck.co.uk/images/Tower_Bridge_Case_Study.pdf |format = PDF |author = Speed Check Services |accessdate = 18 November 2010 |title = Bridge Protection Scheme }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second system monitors other vehicle parameters. [[Induction loop]]s and [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] sensors are used to measure the weight, the height of the chassis above ground level, and the number of axles of each vehicle.&lt;ref name=tbspeedcheck /&gt;

=== River ===
The bascules are raised around 1000 times a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Bridge Lifts |publisher = Tower Bridge Official Website |url = http://www.towerbridge.org.uk/TowerBridge/English/BridgeLifts/ |accessdate = 25 September 2007 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070912190426/http://www.towerbridge.org.uk/TowerBridge/English/BridgeLifts/ |archivedate = 12 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
River traffic is now much reduced, but it still takes priority over road traffic. Today, 24 hours' notice is required before opening the bridge, and opening times are published in advance on the bridge's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Bridge Lift Times |url = http://www.towerbridge.org.uk/lift-times/ |website = Tower Bridge Exhibition |publisher = [[Corporation of the City of London|City of London]] |accessdate = 10 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no charge for vessels to open the bridge.

When needing to be raised for the passage of a vessel the bascules are only raised to an angle sufficient for the vessel to safely pass under the bridge, except in the case of a vessel with the Monarch on board in which case they are raised fully no matter the size of the vessel.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

== Tower Bridge Exhibition ==
[[File:tower.bridge.9.walkwaysinterior.london.arp.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of high-level [[walkway]] (used as an exhibition space)]]
The Tower Bridge Exhibition is a display housed in the bridge's twin towers, the high-level walkways and the Victorian engine rooms. It uses films, photos and interactive displays to explain why and how Tower Bridge was built. Visitors can access the original [[steam engine]]s that once powered the bridge bascules, housed in a building close to the south end of the bridge.&lt;ref name=tbeabout /&gt;

The exhibition charges an admission fee. Entrance is from the west side of the bridge deck to the northern tower, from where visitors ascend to level 4 by lift before crossing the high-level walkways to the southern tower. In the towers and walkways is an exhibition on the history of the bridge. The walkways also provide views over the city, the [[Tower of London]] and the [[Pool of London]], and include a glass-floored section. From the south tower, visitors can visit the engine rooms, with the original steam engines, which are situated in a separate building beside the southern approach to the bridge.&lt;ref name=tbestep&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.towerbridge.org.uk/step-inside/ |title = Step Inside |publisher = Tower Bridge Exhibition |accessdate = 14 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Tower Bridge is an undoubted landmark, professional commentators in the early 20th century were critical of its aesthetics. "It represents the vice of tawdriness and pretentiousness, and of falsification of the actual facts of the structure", wrote [[Henry Heathcote Statham]],&lt;ref&gt;Statham, H.H., "Bridge Engineering", Wiley, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Frank Brangwyn]] stated that "A more absurd structure than the Tower Bridge was never thrown across a strategic river".&lt;ref&gt;Brangwyn, F., and [[Walter Shaw Sparrow|Sparrow, W. S.]], "A Book of Bridges", John Lane, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

Benjamin Crisler, the ''New York Times'' film critic, wrote in 1938: "Three unique and valuable institutions the British have that we in America have not: [[Magna Carta]], the Tower Bridge and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crisler|first1=B.

Tower Bridge is often mistaken for [[London Bridge]],&lt;ref name=mistake&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kIrim0i-VKoC&amp;pg=PA184 |title = Pauline Frommer's London |author = Jason Cochran, Pauline Frommer |page = 184 |publisher = Frommer's |year = 2007 |accessdate = 9 July 2011 |isbn = 978-0-470-05228-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the next bridge upstream. A popular [[urban legend]] is that in 1968, [[Robert P. McCulloch]], the purchaser of the old [[London Bridge (Lake Havasu City)|London Bridge]] that was later shipped to [[Lake Havasu City, Arizona|Lake Havasu City]] in [[Arizona]], believed that he was in fact buying Tower Bridge. This was denied by McCulloch himself and has been debunked by Ivan Luckin, the vendor of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/169982.how_london_bridge_was_sold_to_the_states/ |title = How London Bridge was sold to the States (From This Is Local London) |publisher = Thisislocallondon.co.uk |date =  |accessdate = 13 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A partial replica of Tower Bridge has been built in the city of [[Suzhou, Jiangsu|Suzhou]] in [[China]]. The replica differs from the original in having no lifting mechanism and having four separate towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jun/03/from-tower-bridge-to-sydney-harbour-welcome-to-chinas-city-of-clones |title = From Tower Bridge to Sydney Harbour, welcome to China’s city of clones |work = The Guardian |date = 3 June 2014 |first1 = Michael |last1 = Silk |first2 = Andrew |last2 = Manley |accessdate = 14 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidents ==

On 10 August 1912 [[Francis McClean]] flew between the bascules and the high-level walkways in his [[Short Brothers]] S.33 floatplane.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.towerbridge.org.uk/bridge-history/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thisdayinaviation.com/10-august-1912/&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1952, the bridge opened while a [[London Buses route 78|number 78]] double-decker bus was crossing from the south bank. At that time, the gateman would ring a warning bell and close the gates when the bridge was clear before the watchman ordered the raising of the bridge. The process failed while a relief watchman was on duty. The bus was near the edge of the south bascule when it started to rise; driver Albert Gunter made a split-second decision to accelerate, clearing a {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=on}} gap to drop {{convert|6|ft|m}} onto the north bascule, which had not yet started to rise. There were no serious injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Tower Bridge, London, UK |publisher = BBC |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A559 |accessdate = 11 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = The Jumping Bus |magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date = 12 January 1953 |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,817691,00.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081222123553/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,817691,00.html |archivedate = 22 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunter was given [[GBP|£]]10 (equivalent to £{{inflation|UK|10|1952|r=-1}} in {{inflation-year|UK}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) by the City Corporation to honour his act of bravery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Car Journals |url = http://carjournals.net/mind-the-gap-when-jumping-over-tower-bridge/ |title = Mind The Gap When Jumping Over Tower Bridge |publisher = Car Journals |date =  |accessdate = 20 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hawker Hunter Tower Bridge incident]] occurred on 5 April 1968 when a [[Royal Air Force]] [[Hawker Hunter]] FGA.9 jet fighter from [[No. 1 Squadron RAF|No. 1 Squadron]], flown by Flt Lt Alan Pollock, flew through Tower Bridge. Unimpressed that senior staff were not going to celebrate the RAF's 50th birthday with a [[fly-past]], Pollock decided to do something himself. Without authorisation, Pollock flew the Hunter at low altitude down the Thames, past the [[Houses of Parliament]], and continued on toward Tower Bridge. He flew the Hunter beneath the bridge's walkway, remarking afterwards that it was an afterthought when he saw the bridge looming ahead of him. Pollock was placed under arrest upon landing, and discharged from the RAF on medical grounds without the chance to defend himself at a [[court martial]].&lt;ref&gt;p.157, Shaw, Michael 'No.1 Squadron', Ian Allan 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Hawker Hunter History |work = (scroll down half-way) |publisher = Thunder &amp; Lightnings |date = 29 February 2004 |url = http://www.thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk/hunter/history.html |accessdate = 8 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1973, a single-engined [[Beagle Pup]] was twice flown under the pedestrian walkway of Tower Bridge by 29-year-old stockbroker's clerk Paul Martin. Martin was on bail following accusations of stockmarket fraud. He then "buzzed" buildings in The City, before flying north towards the [[Lake District]] where he died when his aircraft crashed some two hours later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author2 =  |title = Gives Suicide Plan To Crash Plane into Tower of London, Dies in Crash 240 Miles Away |work = Lundington Daily News |date = 1 August 1973 |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VJAKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HUwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4691%2C2487801 |accessdate = 14 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning from a Thames-side lunch at ''Le Pont de la Tour'' restaurant with UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], President Clinton was less punctual and arrived just as the bridge was rising. The bridge opening split the motorcade in two, much to the consternation of security staff.

He was exercising a claimed ancient permission, granted as a right to Freemen, to make a point about the powers of older citizens and the way in which their rights were being eroded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Protest Freeman herds sheep over Tower Bridge |publisher = BBC News |date = 19 August 1999 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/425364.stm |accessdate = 6 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before dawn on 31 October 2003, David Crick, a [[Fathers 4 Justice]] campaigner, climbed a {{convert|100|ft|adj=on}} &lt;!--BBC news sources variously state 100, 120 and 150ft!--&gt; [[tower crane]] near Tower Bridge at the start of a six-day protest dressed as [[Spider-Man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Spiderman protest closes Tower Bridge |publisher = BBC News |date = 31 October 2003 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3231281.stm |accessdate = 31 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing for his safety, and that of motorists should he fall, police cordoned off the area, closing the bridge and surrounding roads and causing widespread traffic congestion across the City and east London. The [[Metropolitan Police]] were later criticised for maintaining the closure for five days when this was not strictly necessary in the eyes of some citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Spiderman cordon criticised |publisher = BBC News |date = 3 November 2003 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3236541.stm |accessdate = 31 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = {{-'}}Spiderman' cleared over protest |publisher=BBC News | date = 14 May 2004 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3715273.stm | accessdate =31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--5-day closure is mentioned here: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3240293.stm ("Bridge reopens") and here: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3246495.stm ("Crick on trial") but I think we have enough references, don't we?

'''uSwitch.com''' is a [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[price comparison service]] and switching website founded in 2000.  The site allows consumers to compare prices for a range of energy, personal finance, insurance and communications services. uSwitchforBusiness.com is uSwitch's energy price comparison and brokerage service for businesses.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
uSwitch.com was founded by [[George Mountbatten, 4th Marquess of Milford Haven|Lord Milford Haven]] in September 2000 with an initial [[Pound sterling|£]]4 million investment to take advantage of the UK’s [[privatization|deregulated]] gas and electricity markets.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} He partnered with Andrew Salmon,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prodirector.net/andrew-salmon-takes-uswitch-model-to-turkey/|title=pro director {{!}} Andrew Salmon takes uSwitch model to Turkey|website=www.prodirector.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://piweek.es/en/andrew-salmon-uswitch/|title=Andrew Salmon and uSwitch, who is the man behind Encazip?|work=Piweek - Tecnología y empresas|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Milford Haven&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://benalmadenadigital.es/empresa/marques-milford-haven-exporta-uswitch/|title=El Marqués de Milford Haven exporta la fórmula de uSwitch|date=2017-12-15|work=Tus noticias de la semana|access-date=2018-05-16|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vipul Amin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vwbblog.com/selling-uswitch-the-story-of-vip-amin/|title=Selling uSwitch: The Story of Vip Amin – VWB Blog|website=www.vwbblog.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company subsequently expanded into the telephony and communications markets in 2001. In the same year it also bought competitor buy.co.uk followed by local community information website UpMyStreet.com in 2003.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

uSwitch.com was itself acquired by US media conglomerate, [[E.W. Scripps Company]] in March 2006 for £210 million ([[US dollar|$]]366 million). The purchase added a second freestanding interactive media business to its portfolio alongside leading US product price comparison site, [[Shopzilla]].&lt;ref name="scripps"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pressreleases.scripps.com/release/834 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408084602/http://pressreleases.scripps.com/release/834 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=April 8, 2006 | title=Scripps acquires uSwitch | date=March 16, 2006 | accessdate=2007-09-29 | work=[[E. W. Scripps Company]] press release }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, E.W. Scripps Company recorded a $411 million pre-tax charge related to the uSwitch acquisition, contributing to an overall $256 million loss for Scripps in the last quarter of 2007. The scale of the writedown reflects more realistic revenue expectations due to lower than expected levels of switching.&lt;ref name="MSN Money 2008-02-29"&gt;[http://news.moneycentral.msn.com/provider/providerarticle.aspx?feed=PR&amp;date=20080229&amp;id=8265305 Scripps Files 10-K, Reports Final Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Results]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, ''[[MSN Money]]'', February 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, uSwitch was acquired by Forward Internet Group for $10.3 million in cash.&lt;ref name="forward-internet"&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1430602/000119312510044950/d10k.htm Scripps Networks 10K] March 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Forward is a privately funded collection of internet-based businesses focused on consumer engagement and innovation.  Forward3D is the group's 3D search agency (formerly known as TrafficBroker) and Forward Innovations is the consumer division which focuses on price comparison and switching, including brands such as InvisibleHand and Omio.

In June 2011, uSwitch acquired [[Top10.com]]. 2011 also saw uSwitch enter the Irish market with  uSwitch.ie, which operates in the same way as the UK but currently offers switching services for broadband, TV, phone and energy services and not insurance or financial services.

In August 2013, LDC backed an [[Management Buyout|MBO]] of uSwitch, the private equity firm acquired a significant stake in the business with Forward Internet Group retaining a substantial minority holding. Both investors aligned with the existing management team who have a minority holding in the business.

On 30 April 2015, the property website firm [[Zoopla]] agreed to purchase uSwitch from LDC for £160 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zoopla to buy uSwitch price comparison site|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32529326|accessdate=30 April 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business model ==
uSwitch.com is a free, online and telephone-based comparison and switching service, helping consumers compare prices on energy, finance, insurance and other services. There are no direct costs to consumers for the service, the company instead receiving commission from some suppliers when a customer chooses to switch to them. uSwitch provide several mechanisms designed to increase suppliers' visibility for a fee.

uSwitch.com was the first comparison website to achieve the [[Plain English Campaign]]’s Internet Crystal Mark &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/news/925-switched-on-to-plain-english.html|title=Switched on to plain English|first=Super|last=User|website=www.plainenglish.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also hosts guides advising the public on how to save money and releases research covering technology, the energy market and financial developments. 
 
uSwitch.com also has a London-based call centre and a [[Freepost]] ‘Send us your bill’ service, where customers can post their latest energy bills to receive comparison advice.

In November 2014, uSwitch.com called for change in the credit reports industry to give everyone to free access to their full credit report every year &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/cardsloans/article-2840662/Give-free-access-credit-report-year-stop-millions-missing-financial-deals.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490|title=Give free access to credit reports once a year so people check it|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the company launched a campaign featuring [[Channel 4]] presenter [[Rachel Riley]] in [[Winkleigh|Winkleigh, Devon]].&lt;ref name="North Devon Gazette"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northdevongazette.co.uk/news/countdown-s-rachel-riley-in-north-devon-with-uswitch-1-5364792 |title=Why will Countdown’s Rachel Riley be heading to North Devon this weekend? |author=Andy Keeble |publisher=North Devon Gazette |date=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accreditation ==
uSwitch is accredited under the [[Ofgem]] Confidence Code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/information-consumers/domestic-consumers/switching-your-energy-supplier/confidence-code|title=Compare gas and electricity tariffs: Ofgem-accredited price comparison sites|website=www.ofgem.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; a voluntary code of practice for online domestic price comparison services. uSwitch was involved in the formation of the Confidence Code in 2002 with Consumer Focus, which managed the code until Ofgem took over in 2013. uSwitch.com was previously accredited by [[Consumer Focus]], and played a role in the industry consultation which led to the establishment of a voluntary code of practice — the Energywatch Confidence Code (now known as the Consumer Focus Confidence Code) — in 2002.

The September 2007 minutes of the Consumer Focus Management Board Meeting, and press reports, show that the company was asked by Consumer Focus to change how it displays comparison results and information so that consumers receive unbiased results.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2006-12-11"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.guardian.co.uk/utilities/story/0,,1969281,00.html | title=uSwitch accused of misleading customers | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=December 11, 2006 | accessdate=2007-09-29 | location=London | first=Miles | last=Brignall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="This Is Money 2007-09-13"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/consumer/bills/article.html?in_article_id=424305&amp;in_page_id=510 | title=uSwitch forced into website change | date=September 13, 2007 | work=[[Daily Mail|thisismoney.co.uk]] | accessdate=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company complied with these requests and has remained accredited.

In Ofgem’s September 2013 audit of the uSwitch.com website, it scored 100% for each of the nine code of practice requirements of the Confidence Code.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

'''Vincent James McMahon Sr.''' (July 6, 1914 – May 24, 1984), also known as '''Vince McMahon Sr.''', was an American [[professional wrestling]] promoter. He is best known for running the [[Capitol Wrestling Corporation]] (subsequently renamed as the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) and World Wrestling Federation (WWF) during his tenure, and currently named [[WWE]]) from 1954 to 1982, and fathering his successor, [[Vince McMahon]].

==Early life==
Vincent James McMahon was born on July 6, 1914, in [[Harlem|Harlem, New York]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/v/vince-mcmahon-sr.html|title=Vincent McMahon|publisher= Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Rose (Davis) and [[Jess McMahon|Roderick James "Jess" McMahon]],{{sfn|Solomon|2006|p=4}} a successful [[boxing]], wrestling and concert promoter, who had worked with legendary [[Madison Square Garden]] promoter [[Tex Rickard]]. His parents were both of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent.&lt;ref name="Roderick"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/National-Wrestling-Alliance-Monopoly-Strangled/dp/1550227416 |title=National Wrestling Alliance: The Untold Story of the Monopoly That Strangled Professional Wrestling|last=Hornbaker|first=Tim|year=2007|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=1-55022-741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an older brother, Roderick Jr., and a younger sister, Dorothy. As a child, McMahon would often accompany his father to Madison Square Garden where he would play, and later, begin learning the family business.

==Professional wrestling==
McMahon saw the tremendous potential for growth that the pro wrestling industry had in the era following [[World War II]], especially with the development of [[television]] and its need for new programming. Similar to boxing, wrestling took place primarily within a small ring and could be covered adequately by one or two cameras, and venues for it could readily be assembled in television studios, lessening production costs.

McMahon's group, the [[WWE|Capitol Wrestling Corporation]], which was later renamed [[WWE#Prior to Titan Sports|World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF)]] and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), came to dominate professional wrestling in the 1950s and 1960s in the nation's most populous area, the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. His control was primarily in Baltimore, New York, and New Jersey.{{sfn|Ellison|2003|p=92}} Despite its name, the WWWF was, like all professional wrestling promotions of that era, mostly a regional operation. It was however the one that came to dominate the most lucrative region.

In 1955, McMahon began airing his matches on television on Wednesday nights on the [[DuMont Network]]. The telecast originated from an old barn in Washington, D.C. It was one of the struggling network's last live sports telecasts before it went out of business the following year; however, WABD, DuMont's flagship station in New York (Now Fox-owned [[WNYW]]), kept the show after becoming an independent station, airing wrestling on Saturday nights until 1971.

In her biography, wrestler [[The Fabulous Moolah]] claimed that McMahon was one of the first promoters to split gate proceeds with his wrestlers.{{sfn|Ellison|2003|p=96}}

Unlike his son, McMahon believed that the job of a promoter should be kept backstage or behind the scenes and should never interfere with the action in the ring. As a result, McMahon almost never came down to the squared circle. He can however clearly be seen standing ringside during the infamous Madison Square Garden "Alley Fight" between [[Sgt. Slaughter]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]]. Though McMahon appeared in the movie ''[[The Wrestler (1974 film)|The Wrestler]]'' in a cast that was dominated by contemporary wrestlers, he believed that wrestlers should remain wrestlers and not branch off into other forms of media. Accordingly, he disapproved of [[Hulk Hogan]]'s appearance in ''[[Rocky III]]'' in 1981, leading to Hogan's temporary departure in favour of [[Verne Gagne]]'s [[American Wrestling Association]]. When his son purchased the WWF, he felt differently than his father on the issue. He rehired Hogan as his top star and avidly supported wrestlers branching out into other fields, as well as cross-promotions with various musicians, actors, and other personalities outside of wrestling.{{sfn|Ellison|2003|p=92}}

In 1982, McMahon sold the parent company of the World Wrestling Federation to his son [[Vince McMahon]] and his company [[WWE|Titan Sports, Inc.]] His son much to his father's initial concern, set out to make the WWF national and eventually worldwide in scope. "Had my father known what I was going to do", the younger McMahon told ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' in 1991, "he never would have sold his stock to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119010/2/index.htm|title=Wrestling With Success|last=Johnson |first=William Oscar|date=March 25, 1991|publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]''|accessdate=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The younger McMahon's competitive tactics were successful, and the WWF quickly became the most prominent exponent of "sports entertainment".

===Legacy===
Vince McMahon is still running his father's promotion, which since 2002 has been called World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). McMahon's grandchildren [[Shane McMahon|Shane]] and [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie]] have also worked for the WWF/E.

McMahon was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWF Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (1996)|class of 1996]], by his grandson Shane.

==Personal life and death==
McMahon had two sons; Roderick James McMahon III, and [[Vince McMahon]] with his first wife Vicky H. Askew (born 1920) in 1945. McMahon married his second wife, Juanita W. Johnston (December 20, 1916 – January 19, 1998), and the couple lived in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], but McMahon would not live to see his company grow from a territorial promotion to what is now a worldwide organization. On May 24, 1984,&lt;ref name="WWEBio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/vincemcmahon/|title=Vincent J. McMahon|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon died at age 69, and is buried in Our Lady Queen of Heaven Catholic Cemetery in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]].

'''Zippy the Pinhead''' is a fictional character who is the [[protagonist]] of ''Zippy'', an American [[comic strip]] created by [[Bill Griffith]]. Zippy's most famous quotation, "Are we having fun yet?", appears in ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'' and became a [[catchphrase]]. He almost always wears a yellow [[muumuu]]/[[clown suit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bktLaSRoG1sC&amp;pg=PA87|title=Marketing Through Minefields|publisher=Harvard Business Press|year=2008|author=Bill Griffith|isbn=978-1-4221-9992-3|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; with large red polka dots, and puffy, white [[clown]] shoes.&lt;ref name=zip&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aaaunderstanding.html |title=Understanding |publisher=Zippythepinhead.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Other forms of attire may be seen when appropriate to the context, e.g. a [[toga]].) Although in name and appearance, Zippy is a [[microcephalic]], he is distinctive not so much for his skull shape, or for any identifiable form of brain damage, but for his enthusiasm for philosophical [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequiturs]] ("All life is a blur of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and meat!"), verbal [[Free association (psychology)|free association]], and the pursuit of [[popular culture]] ephemera. His wholehearted devotion to random artifacts [[satire|satirizes]] the excesses of [[consumerism]].

The character of Zippy the Pinhead initially appeared in [[underground comix|underground]] publications during the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Estren |first1=Mark James |title=A History of Underground Comics |year=1993 |publisher=Ronin Publishing |isbn=0-914171-64-X |page=8 |chapter=Foreword: Onward! }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Zippy'' comic is distributed by [[King Features Syndicate]] to more than 100 newspapers, and Griffith self-syndicates strips to college newspapers and [[Alternative weekly|alternative weeklies]]. The strip is unique among syndicated multi-panel dailies for its characteristics of [[literary nonsense]], including a near-absence of either straightforward gags or continuous narrative, and for its unusually intricate artwork, which is reminiscent of the style of Griffith's 1970s underground comics.

==Origin==
Zippy made his first appearance in ''Real Pulp Comics'' #1 in March 1971, published by [[Print Mint]]. In a 2008 interview with Alex Dueben, Griffith recalled how it all began:
:I first saw the 1932 Tod Browning film ''[[Freaks (film)|Freaks]]'' in 1963 at a screening at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, where I was attending art school. I was fascinated by the pinheads in the introductory scene and asked the projectionist (who I knew) if he could slow down the film so I could hear what they were saying better. He did and I loved the poetic, random dialog. Little did I know that Zippy was being planted in my fevered brain. Later, in San Francisco in 1970, I was asked to contribute a few pages to ''Real Pulp Comics'' #1, edited by cartoonist [[Roger Brand]]. His only guideline was to say "Maybe do some kind of love story, but with really weird people." I never imagined I'd still be putting words into Zippy's fast-moving mouth some 38 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=18342 |title=Dueben, Alex. "Is Bill Griffith Having Fun Yet?", CBR, October 6, 2008 |publisher=Comicbookresources.com |date=2008-10-06 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strip began in ''[[Berkeley Barb|The Berkeley Barb]]'' in 1976 and was syndicated nationally soon after, originally as a weekly strip. When [[William Randolph Hearst III]] took over the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' in 1985, he offered Griffith an opportunity to do ''Zippy'' as a daily strip. Several months later it was picked up for worldwide [[Daily comic strip|daily distribution]] by [[King Features Syndicate]] in 1986. The [[Sunday strip|Sunday ''Zippy'']] debuted in 1990. When the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' canceled ''Zippy'' briefly in 2002, the newspaper received thousands of letters of protest, including one from [[Robert Crumb]], who called ''Zippy'' "by far the very best daily comic strip that exists in America." The ''Chronicle'' quickly restored the strip but dropped it again in 2004, leading to more protests as well as grateful letters from non-fans.

The strip has developed a [[cult following]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=A Cult of Comic Proportions|last=Muro|first=Mark|date=March 11, 1988|work=|newspaper=Boston Globe|access-date=|via=EBSCOHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to be syndicated in many newspapers, often ranking at or near the bottom of reader polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/comics/poll98.htm |title=''Washington Post'' |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=1998-07-17 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters and story==
Zippy's original appearance was partly inspired by the [[Microcephaly|microcephalic]] [[Schlitzie]], from the film ''[[Freaks]]'', which was enjoying something of a cult revival at the time, and [[P. T. Barnum]]'s sideshow performer [[Zip the Pinhead]], who may not have been a [[microcephalic]] but was nevertheless billed as one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aaishehavingfunyet.html |title=Are We Having Fun Yet? |publisher=Zippythepinhead.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Coincidentally, the real name of the latter was William Henry Johnson, or Jackson according to some sources, and Griffith's full name is William Henry Jackson Griffith, after [[William Henry Jackson|his great-grandfather]], the noted photographer.)

Griffith has never committed himself to a set origin story for Zippy; no fewer than five have appeared:
* a strange visitor from another planet{{issue|date=September 2016}}
* a pinhead who wandered away from the circus{{issue|date=September 2016}}
* an android whose inventor didn't live to see its imperfections{{issue|date=September 2016}}
* the secret identity of a jaded heir to a fortune who decided to apply Zen to everyday life{{issue|date=September 2016}}
* a college student who inexplicably turned into a pinhead{{issue|date=September 2016}}

Griffith also never committed himself to any set time period or home location for Zippy.

Zippy's favorite foods are [[taco sauce]] and [[Ding Dongs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aacast.html |title=Cast of Characters |publisher=Zippythepinhead.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zippy's unpredictable behavior sometimes causes severe difficulty for others, but never for himself. (For example, drug dealers tried to use him as a drug mule, but lost their stash or were jailed.){{issue|date=September 2016}}

He is married to a nearly identical pinhead named '''Zerbina''', has two children, '''[[nuclear fuel|Fuelrod]]''' (a boy) and '''[[nuclear meltdown|Meltdown]]''' (a girl), both apparently in their early teens, and owns a cat named '''Dingy'''. His parents, '''Ebb''' and '''Flo''', live in Florida. Zippy's angst-ridden twin brother '''Lippy''' also frequently appears. He is portrayed as Zippy's total opposite, often dressed in a conservative suit, thinking sequentially, and avoiding his brother's penchant for non-sequiturs. In a daily strip dated 8 March 2005, he is depicted as being deeply moved by the poetry of [[Leonard Cohen]], the landscape paintings of [[Maxfield Parrish]], and the music of [[John Tesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zippythepinhead.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=ZTP&amp;Product_Code=8-Mar-05&amp;Category_Code= |title=Lippy's Lite Side |publisher=Zippy the Pinhead |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has four close friends:
* '''Claude Funston''', a hapless working man
* '''Griffy''', a stand-in for Bill Griffith, who often appears in the strip to complain about various aspects of modern life
* '''Shelf-Life''', a fast-talking schemer always looking for "the next big thing"
* '''Vizeen Nurney''', a 20-something lounge singer who, despite her rebellious image, has an optimistic and sympathetic nature

A humanoid [[toad]], '''Mr. Toad''' (less commonly "Mr. the Toad") who embodies blind greed and selfishness, appears occasionally (along with his wife, '''Mrs. Toad''', and their children, '''Mustang''' and '''Blazer'''), as do '''The Toadettes''', a group of mindless and interchangeable amphibians, who pop up here and there; and the '''Stupidity Patrol''', described by Bill Griffith as "cruising the streets of [[Los Angeles|L.A.]], correcting the behavior of insensitive louts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aacast.html |title=Cast of Characters |publisher=Zippythepinhead.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Doggie Diner 1.jpg|thumb|right|The actual sign for the San Francisco Doggie Diner, commonly portrayed in the comic strip as one of Zippy's conversational foils]]

Another occasionally occurring character is '''God''', appearing either as a disembodied head or a head superimposed on various peoples' bodies. He is depicted as either conversing with Zippy on various philosophical topics, or commenting on humanity in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zippythepinhead.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=ZTP&amp;Product_Code=19-Jun-13&amp;Category_Code= |title=Stand Back! |publisher=Zippythepinhead.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his daily-strip incarnation, Zippy spends much of his time traveling and commenting on interesting places; recent strips focus on his fascination with roadside icons featuring giant beings; Zippy also frequently participates in his long-running conversation with the giant fiberglass doggie mascot of [[San Francisco]]'s [[Doggie Diner]] chain (later, the Carousel diner near the [[San Francisco Zoo]]).  For a while the Zippy website encouraged people to send photos of interesting places for Zippy to visit in the strip.

In 2007, Griffith began to focus his daily strip on the fictional city of Dingburg, [[Maryland]], Zippy's "birthplace" which, according to the cartoonist, is located "17 [[mile]]s [[west]] of [[Baltimore]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavna |first=Michael |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2008/10/the_morning_line_from_blues_to.html |title=Cavna, Michael. "The Morning Line: 'Zippy' Creator Draws on Real (Pungent) Maryland," ''The Washington Post'', Tuesday, October 21, 2008 |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date=2008-10-21 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffith said, "Over the years, I began to expand Zippy's circle of friends beyond my usual cast of characters to a wider world of people like Zippy--other pinheads. I kept this up for a few months, happily adding more and more muu-muu-clad men and women until one day the whole thing just reached critical mass. The thought then occurred, 'Where do all these friends of Zippy live? Do they live in the real world which Zippy has been seen escaping for years—or do they live apart, in a pinhead world of their own?' Thus Dingburg, 'The City Inhabited Entirely by Pinheads' was born. It even had a motto: 'Going too far is half the pleasure of not getting anywhere'. The logical next step was to imagine Dingburg streets and neighborhoods—to create a place where Zippy's wacky rules would be the norm and everyone would play 24-hour Skeeball and worship at the feet of the giant [[Muffler Man]]. Zippy had, at last, found his home town."

In regard to Zippy's famous catch phrase, at the 2003 University of Florida Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels, Griffith recalled the phone call from ''Bartlett's'':
:When ''Bartlett's'' approached me in—I forget what year, five or six years ago—I got a call from the editor. And he was going to give me credit for the "Are we having fun yet" saying, but he wanted to know exactly where Zippy had first said it. I did some research (I had no idea), and I eventually found... the strip "Back to Pinhead, the Punks and the Monks" from ''Yow'' #2 in 1979... That's the first time he said, "Are we having fun yet?" Certainly not intended by me to be anything more than another non sequitur coming out of Zippy's mind.

Zippy's signature expression of surprise is "Yow!"

==Appearances elsewhere==
Following rumors of a ''Zippy'' movie project that was never consummated, Griffith devoted dozens of strips to his real and imagined dealings with Hollywood. An animated television series, to be produced by [[DPS Film Roman|Film Roman]] and co-written by [[Diane Noomin]], was in negotiations from 1996 to 2001.

On July 9, 2004, Zippy made his stage debut in San Francisco in ''Fun: The Concept'' at the Dark Room Theatre. Bill Griffith approved of the adaptation, though he did not work on the project. ''Fun: The Concept'' was adapted by Denzil J. Meyers with Jim Fourniadis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

A collection of about 1,000 Zippy quotes was formerly packaged and distributed with the [[Emacs]] text editor. Some installations of the "[[Fortune (Unix)|fortune]]" command, available on most Unix-type systems, also contain this collection. This gives Zippy a very wide audience, since most Emacs users can have a random Zippy quote printed on their screen by typing "M-x yow" and most Linux or BSD users can get a random quote by typing "fortune zippy" in a [[Unix shell|shell]]. However, as a result of a decision by [[Richard Stallman]] prompted by FSF lawyer [[Eben Moglen]], motivated by copyright concerns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2006-06/msg00290.html |title=Re: yow.c |publisher=Lists.gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  these quotes were erased in GNU Emacs 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/emacs/etc/yow.lines?revision=1.11&amp;root=emacs&amp;view=markup |title=[emacs&amp;#93; View of /emacs/etc/yow.lines |publisher=Cvs.savannah.gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zippy under emacs now will only say "Yow! Legally-imposed CULTURE-reduction is CABBAGE-BRAINED!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.red-bean.com/pipermail/arcana/2007-August/000019.html|title=[Arcana] Yow! Legally-imposed CULTURE-reduction is CABBAGE-BRAINED!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zippy can be restored by replacing the yow file with one from an older Emacs.

After Griffith criticized [[Scott Adams]]' comic ''[[Dilbert]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aaarticles.html |title=Articles by Bill Griffith |publisher=Zippythepinhead.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams responded on May 18, 1998, with a comic strip called ''Pippy the Ziphead'', "cramming as much artwork in as possible so no one will notice there's only one joke... [and] it's on the reader."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/1998-05-18/ |title=Dilbert comic strip for May 18, 1998 |publisher=Dilbert.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dilbert (character)|Dilbert]] notes that the strip is "nothing but a clown with a small head who says random things" and [[Dogbert]] responds that he is "maintaining his artistic integrity by creating a comic that no one will enjoy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dilbert.com/strip/1998-05-19 |title=Dilbert comic strip for May 19, 1998 |publisher=Dilbert.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zippy also makes an appearance in the round-robin work ''[[The Narrative Corpse]]'' where he takes the [[stick figure]] protagonist to [[Croatia]] for "peace and quiet". Another appearance can be found in the [[Ramones]]' comic book-themed compilation ''[[Weird Tales of the Ramones]]'', consisting of Zippy asking to play "air glockenspiel" for the band.
