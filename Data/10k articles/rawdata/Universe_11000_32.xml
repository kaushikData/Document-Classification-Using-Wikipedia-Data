The '''Assyrian lion weights''' are a group of bronze [[Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement|Mesopotamian weights]] from the 8th century BCE, with [[bilingual inscription]]s in both [[cuneiform]] and [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] characters. The lion weights were discovered at [[Nimrud]] in the late 1840s and are now in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Copper+Assyrian+lion+weight+palace British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

The weights date from the 8th century BCE and they have [[bilingual inscription]]s in both [[cuneiform]] and [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] characters. The Phoenician inscriptions are epigraphically from the same period as the [[Mesha Stele]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XS4y4dWcA64C&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;ots=HZ2efluhs5&amp;pg=PA133#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Alphabet: An Account of the Origin and Development of Letters], Kegan Paul, Trench, 1883, [[Isaac Taylor (priest)|Isaac Taylor]], page 133, "The lion weights from Nineveh, which bear the names of Assyrian kings who reigned during the second half of the 8th century, an engraved scarab found beneath the foundation of the palace of Sargon at Khorsabad, and the bronze vessel dedicated to the temple of Baal-Lebanon, which bears the name of Hiram, king of the Sidonians, are epigraphically of the same age, or nearly so, as the inscription of Mesha"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norris, 1856, p.215&lt;/ref&gt; They are one of the most important groups of artifacts evidencing the "Aramaic" form of the Phoenician script.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/480526/Epigraphic_West_Semitic_Scripts Epigraphic West Semitic Scripts], 2006, Elsevier, Christopher Rollston, p.503, quote: "Some of the most important evidence for the Aramaic cursive script series are the Hamat bricks, the Lion-Weights from Nineveh, and the Nimrud ostracon (all dating to the 8th century)."&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of their discovery, they were the oldest Phoenician-style inscription that had been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rawlinson (1865), [https://archive.org/details/jstor-25207655 Bilingual Readings: Cuneiform and Phœnician. Notes on Some Tablets in the British Museum, Containing Bilingual Legends (Assyrian and Phœnician)], p.243, "Before concluding my notes on these tablet and seal legends, I would observe that they are among the most ancient specimens that we possess of Phoenician writing. I should select as the earliest specimens of all, the legends on the larger Lion Weights in the British Museum, one of which is clearly dated from the reign of Tiglath Pileser II. (b.c. 744-726). The other weights bear the royal names of Shalmaneser, Sargon, and Sennacherib."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The set form a regular series diminishing in size from 30&amp;nbsp;cm to 2&amp;nbsp;cm in length. The larger weights have handles cast on to the bodies, and the smaller have rings attached to them. The group of weights also included stone weights in the shape of ducks. The weights represent the earliest known uncontested example of the Aramaic [[numeral system]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kXZhBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Numerical Notation: A Comparative History], CUP, 2010, Stephen Chrisomalis, page 71, {{ISBN|9781139485333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight of the lions are represented with the only known inscriptions from the short reign of [[Shalmaneser V]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=amlXOOaSuLMC&amp;pg=PA285#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Oxford Guide to People &amp; Places of the Bible], p.285, Bruce Manning Metzger, Michael D. Coogan, Oxford University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|9780195176100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar lion weights were excavated at the Iranian site of [[Susa]] in 1901 by the French archaeologist [[Jacques de Morgan]] and are now in the [[Louvre]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=12407 Louvre Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two known systems of weights and measures from the ancient  Middle East. One system was based on a weight called the [[Mina (unit)|mina]] which could be broken down into sixty smaller weights called [[shekel]]s. These lion weights, however, come from a different system which was based on the ''heavy mina'' which weighed about a kilogram. This system was still being used in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian period]] and is thought to have been used for weighing metals.

==Discovery==
The weights were discovered by [[Austen Henry Layard]] in his earliest excavations at [[Nimrud]] (1845–51). A pair of [[lamassu]] were found at a gateway, one of which had fallen against the other and had broken into several pieces. After lifting the statue, Layard's team discovered under it sixteen lion weights.&lt;ref&gt;Layard, [https://archive.org/details/ninevehanditsre19layagoog Nineveh and its Remains], Murray, 1849, p.46-47: "I lifted the body with difficulty; and discovered under it sixteen copper lions, of admirable execution, forming a regular series, diminishing in size from the largest, which was above one foot in length, to the smallest, which scarcely exceeded an inch. A ring attached to the back of each, gave them the appearance of weights. In the same place were the fragments of an earthen vase, on which were represented two figures, with the wings and claws of a bird, the breasts of a woman, and the tail of a scorpion."&lt;/ref&gt; The artefacts were first deciphered by [[Edwin Norris]], who confirmed that they had originally been used as weights.&lt;ref&gt;Madden, 1864, p.249&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8893">The '''Axion Dark Matter Experiment''' ('''ADMX''', also written as ''Axion Dark Matter eXperiment'' in the project's documentation) uses a [[Microwave cavity|resonant microwave cavity]] within a large superconducting magnet to search for cold dark matter [[axions]] in the local galactic [[dark matter]] halo. Unusually for a dark matter detector, it is not located deep underground.  Sited at the Center for Experimental Nuclear Physics and Astrophysics (CENPA) at the [[University of Washington]], ADMX is a large collaborative effort with researchers from universities and laboratories around the world.

==Background==

The [[axion]] is a hypothetical elementary particle originally postulated to solve the [[strong CP problem]]. The axion is also an extremely attractive [[dark matter]] candidate. The axion is the puzzle piece allowing these two mysteries to fit naturally into our understanding of the universe.

===Strong CP problem===

The axion was originally postulated to exist as part of the solution to the "strong CP problem". This problem arose from the observation that the [[strong force]] holding nuclei together and the weak force making [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] decay differ in the amount of [[CP violation]] in their interactions. [[Weak interaction]] was expected to feed into the [[strong interactions]] ([[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]]), yielding appreciable [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] CP violation, but no such violation has been observed to very high accuracy. One solution to this Strong CP Problem ends up introducing a new particle called the [[axion]]. If the axion is very light, it interacts so weakly that it would be nearly impossible to detect but would be an ideal dark matter candidate. The ADMX experiment aims to detect this extraordinarily weakly coupled particle.

[[File:1e0657 scale.jpg|150px|thumb|right|The Bullet Cluster: HST image with overlays. The total projected mass distribution reconstructed from strong and weak gravitational lensing is shown in blue, while the X-ray emitting hot gas observed with Chandra is shown in red.]]

===Dark matter===
Although dark matter can't be seen directly, its gravitational interactions with familiar matter leave unmistakable evidence for its existence. The universe we see today simply wouldn't look the way it does without dark matter. Approximately five times more abundant than ordinary matter, the nature of dark matter remains one of the biggest mysteries in physics today. In addition to solving the [[strong CP problem]], the axion could provide an answer to the question "what is dark matter made of?" The axion is a neutral particle that is extraordinarily weakly interacting and could be produced in the right amount to constitute dark matter. If the dark matter accounting for the bulk of all matter in our universe is axions, ADMX is one of only few experiments able to detect it.

==History==
[[Pierre Sikivie]] invented the axion haloscope in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.51.1415 |title=Experimental Tests of the "Invisible" Axion |year=1983 |last1=Sikivie |first1=P. |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=51 |issue=16 |page=1415 |bibcode=1983PhRvL..51.1415S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After smaller scale experiments at the [[University of Florida]] demonstrated the practicality of the axion haloscope, ADMX was constructed at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in 1995. In 2010 ADMX moved to the Center for Experimental Physics and Astrophysics (CENPA) at the [[University of Washington]]. Led by Dr. Leslie Rosenberg, ADMX is undergoing an upgrade that will allow it to be sensitive to a broad range of plausible dark-matter axion masses and couplings.

==Experiment==
The experiment (written as "eXperiment" in the project's documentation) is designed to detect the very weak conversion of dark matter axions into microwave photons in the presence of a strong magnetic field. Axion conversion into photons is stimulated by an apparatus consisting of an 8&amp;nbsp;[[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] magnet and a cryogenically cooled high-Q tunable microwave cavity. When the cavity's resonant frequency is tuned to the axion mass, the interaction between nearby axions in the [[Milky Way]] [[Galactic halo|halo]] and ADMX's magnetic field is enhanced. This results in the deposit of a very tiny amount of power (less than a yoctowatt) into the cavity.

An extraordinarily sensitive microwave receiver allows the very weak axion signal to be extracted from the noise. The experiment receiver features quantum-limited noise performance delivered by an exotic [[SQUID|Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID)]] amplifier and lower temperatures from a &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He refrigerator. ADMX is the first experiment sensitive to realistic dark-matter axion masses and couplings and the improved detector allows an even more sensitive search.

[[File:ADMX magnet installation.jpg|thumb|left|The ADMX magnet being installed at the University of Washington.  Although installed below the floor, the detector is in a surface laboratory.]]

===Cavity===
The microwave cavity within the magnet bore is at the heart of ADMX. It is a circular cylinder, 1 meter long and 0.5 meter diameter. ADMX searches for axions by slowly scanning the cavity resonant frequency by adjusting positions of two tuning rods within the cavity. A signal appears when the cavity resonant frequency matches the axion mass.

The expected signal from axion decay is so small that the entire experiment is cooled to well below 4.2 kelvin with a liquid helium refrigerator to minimize thermal noise. The electric field within the cavity is sampled by a tiny antenna connected to an ultra-low-noise microwave receiver.

===Receiver===
The ultra-low noise microwave receiver makes the experiment possible. The dominant background is thermal noise arising from the cavity and the receiver electronics. Signals from the cavity are amplified by an exotic cryogenic Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) amplifier followed by ultralow noise cryogenic [[HFET]] amplifiers. The receiver then downconverts microwave cavity frequencies to a lower frequency that can be easily digitized and saved. The receiver chain is sensitive to powers smaller than 0.01 yoctowatts; this is the world's lowest-noise microwave receiver in a production environment.

==Progress==
ADMX has already eliminated one of the two axion benchmark models from 1.9&amp;nbsp;μeV to 3.53&amp;nbsp;μeV, assuming axions saturate the Milky Way's halo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A SQUID-based microwave cavity search for dark-matter axions |date=28 January 2010 |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=104 |issue=4  |page=041301 |author1=The ADMX Collaboration |last2=Asztalos |first2=S.J. |last3=Carosi |first3=G. |last4=Hagmann |first4=C. |last5=Kinion |first5=D. |last6=van Bibber |first6=K. |last7=Hotz |first7=M. |last8=Rosenberg |first8=L. |last9=Rybka |first9=G. |last10=Hoskins |first10=J. |last11=Hwang |first11=J. |last12=Sikivie |first12=P. |last13=Tanner |first13=D.

ADMX is undergoing an upgrade to the "Definitive Experiment"; this is sensitive to a very broad range of plausible dark-matter axion masses and couplings. Greater sensitivity will be possible with the upgrade to SQUID amplifiers and the addition of a [[dilution refrigerator]].

===SQUID amplifiers===
Several years ago, the ADMX amplifier [[noise temperature]] was around 2&amp;nbsp;K. Recently the amplifiers were replaced by SQUID amplifiers, which greatly lowered the noise (to less than 100&amp;nbsp;mK) and vastly improved sensitivity. ADMX has demonstrated that the SQUID amplifier allows for quantum-limited-power sensitivity.  More recently, ADMX has acquired Josephson Parametric Amplifiers which allow quantum noise limited searches at higher frequencies.

===Dilution refrigerator===
{{main|Dilution refrigerator}}
The addition of a dilution refrigerator is the main focus of the ADMX upgrade program. The dilution refrigerator allows cooling the apparatus down to 100&amp;nbsp;mK or less, reducing the noise to 0.15&amp;nbsp;K, which makes data taking 400 times faster. This makes it the "Definitive Experiment".

The Haloscope at Yale Sensitive to Axion CDM, or HAYSTAC (formerly known as ADMX-High Frequency), hosted at [[Yale University]], is using a Josephson Parametric Amplifier, 9&amp;nbsp;T magnet, and microwave cavity with radius of 5&amp;nbsp;cm and height 25&amp;nbsp;cm to search masses 19–24&amp;nbsp;µeV.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15526">A '''balance spring''', or '''hairspring''', is a spring attached to the [[balance wheel]] in mechanical [[timepiece]]s. It causes the balance wheel to oscillate with a [[resonant frequency]] when the timepiece is running, which controls the speed at which the wheels of the timepiece turn, and thus the rate of movement of the hands.  A '''regulator lever''' is often fitted, which can be used to alter the free length of the spring and thereby adjust the rate of the timepiece.

The balance spring is a fine [[spiral]] or [[Helix|helical]] [[torsion spring]] used in [[mechanical watch]]es, [[alarm clock]]s, kitchen [[timer]]s, [[marine chronometer]]s, and other timekeeping mechanisms to control the rate of oscillation of the [[balance wheel]].    The balance spring is an essential adjunct to the balance wheel, causing it to oscillate back and forth. The balance spring and balance wheel together form a [[harmonic oscillator]], which oscillates with a precise [[Frequency|period]] or "beat" resisting external disturbances, and is responsible for timekeeping accuracy.

The addition of the balance spring to the balance wheel around 1657 by [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Christiaan Huygens]] greatly increased the accuracy of portable timepieces, transforming early [[pocketwatch]]es from expensive novelties to useful timekeepers.    Improvements to the balance spring are responsible for further large increases in accuracy since that time.  Modern balance springs are made of special low [[temperature coefficient]] alloys like [[nivarox]] to reduce the effects of temperature changes on the rate, and carefully shaped to minimize the effect of changes in drive force as the [[mainspring]] runs down.   Before the 1980s, balance wheels and balance springs were used in virtually every portable timekeeping device, but in recent decades electronic [[Quartz clock|quartz timekeeping]] technology has replaced mechanical clockwork, and the major remaining use of balance springs is in mechanical watches.

==History==

There is some dispute as to whether it was invented around 1660 by British physicist [[Robert Hooke]] or Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]], with the likelihood being that Hooke first had the idea, but Huygens built the first functioning watch that used a balance spring.&lt;ref&gt;A.

The introduction of the balance spring effected an enormous increase in the accuracy of [[pocketwatch]]es, from perhaps several hours per day&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Milham | first= Willis I. | title=Time and Timekeepers | year=1945 | publisher=MacMillan | location=New York | isbn=0-7808-0008-7}}, p.226&lt;/ref&gt; to 10 minutes per day,&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;{{Cite web|year=2002 |title=A Revolution in Timekeeping, part 3 |work=A Walk Through Time |publisher=NIST (National Inst. of Standards and Technology) |url=http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/revol.html |accessdate=2007-06-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528005441/http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/revol.html |archivedate=2007-05-28 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; making them useful timekeepers for the first time.  The first balance springs had only a few turns.

A few early watches had a Barrow regulator, which used a [[worm drive]], but the first widely used regulator was invented by [[Thomas Tompion]] around 1680.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Mundy |first=Oliver |title=Regulator |work=A Brief Glossary of Technical Terms |publisher=The Watch Cabinet |url=http://www.horologia.co.uk/glossary5.html |accessdate=2008-05-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305104939/http://www.horologia.co.uk/glossary5.html |archivedate=2008-03-05 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Tompion regulator the curb pins were mounted on a semicircular toothed rack, which was adjusted by fitting a key to a cog and turning it.  The modern regulator, a lever pivoted concentrically with the balance wheel, was patented by Joseph Bosley in 1755, but it didn't replace the Tompion regulator until the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horologia.co.uk/watchglossary.html Mundy, ''Bosley Regulator'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulator==

{{Section OR|date=March 2014}}

In order to adjust the rate, the balance spring usually has a ''regulator''. The regulator is a moveable lever mounted on the balance cock or bridge, pivoted coaxially with the balance. A narrow slot is formed on one end of the regulator by two downward projecting pins, called curb pins, or by a curb pin and a pin with a heavier section called a boot.  The end of the outer turn of the balance spring is fixed in a stud which is secured to the balance cock. The outer turn of the spring then passes through the regulator slot. The portion of the spring between the stud and the slot is held stationary, so the position of the slot controls the free length of the spring.  Moving the regulator slides the slot along the outer turn of the spring, changing its effective length.  Moving the slot away from the stud shortens the spring, making it stiffer, increasing the balance's oscillation rate, and making the timepiece gain time.

The regulator interferes slightly with the motion of the spring, causing inaccuracy, so precision timepieces like [[marine chronometer]]s and some high end watches are ''free sprung'', meaning they don't have a regulator.  Instead, their rate is adjusted by timing screws on the balance wheel.

There are two principal types of Balance Spring Regulator.
* The Tompion Regulator, in which the Curb Pins are mounted on a sector-rack, moved by a pinion. The pinion is usually fitted with a graduated silver or steel disc.
* The Bosley Regulator, as described above, in which the Pins are mounted on a lever pivoted coaxially with the Balance, the extremity of the lever being able to be moved over a graduated scale. There are several variants which improve the accuracy with which lever can be moved, including the "Snail" regulator, in which the lever is sprung against a cam of spiral profile which can be turned, the Micrometer, in which the lever is moved by a worm gear, and the "Swans Neck" or "Reed" regulator in which the position of the lever is adjusted by a fine screw, the lever being held in contact with the screw by a spring in the shape of a curved swans neck. This was invented and patented by the American George P. Reed, US patent No. 61,867 dated February 5, 1867.

There is also a "Hog's Hair" or "Pig's Bristle" regulator, in which stiff fibres are positioned at the extremities of the Balance's arc, and bring it to a gentle halt before throwing it back. The Watch is accelerated by shortening the arc. This is not a Balance Spring Regulator, being used in the earliest Watches before the Balance Spring was invented.

There is also a Barrow Regulator, but this is really the earlier of the two principal methods of giving the Mainspring "set-up tension"; that required to keep the Fusee chain in tension but not enough to actually drive the Watch. Verge Watches can be regulated by adjusting the set-up tension, but if any of the previously described Regulators is present then this is not usually done.

==Material==
A number of materials have been used for balance springs.  Early on, steel was used, but without any hardening or tempering process applied; as a result, these springs would gradually weaken and the watch would start losing time.  Some watchmakers, for example [[John Arnold (watchmaker)|John Arnold]], used gold, which avoids the problem of corrosion but retains the problem of gradual weakening.  Hardened and tempered steel was first used by [[John Harrison]] and subsequently remained the material of choice until the 20th century.

In 1833, [[Edward John Dent |E. J. Dent]] (maker of the [[Big Ben |Great Clock of the Houses of Parliament]]) experimented with a glass balance spring. This was much less affected by heat than steel, reducing the compensation required, and also didn't rust. Other trials with glass springs revealed that they were difficult and expensive to make, and they suffered from a widespread perception of fragility, which persisted until the time of fibreglass and fibre-optic materials.&lt;ref&gt;"The Marine Chronometer, its History and development" by R. T. Gould. Page 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of temperature==
The [[modulus of elasticity]] of materials is dependent on temperature.  For most materials, this temperature coefficient is large enough that variations in temperature significantly affect the timekeeping of a balance wheel and balance spring.  The earliest makers of watches with balance springs, such as [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Christiaan Huygens]], observed this effect without finding a solution to it.

[[John Harrison]], in the course of his development of the [[marine chronometer]], solved the problem by a "compensation curb" – essentially a [[bimetallic strip|bimetallic thermometer]] which adjusted the effective length of the balance spring as a function of temperature.  While this scheme worked well enough to allow Harrison to meet the standards set by the [[Longitude Act]], it was not widely adopted.

Around 1765, [[Pierre Le Roy]] (son of [[Julien Le Roy]]) invented the compensation balance, which became the standard approach for temperature compensation in watches and chronometers.  In this approach, the shape of the balance is altered, or adjusting weights are moved on the spokes or rim of the balance, by a temperature-sensitive mechanism.  This changes the moment of inertia of the balance wheel, and the change is adjusted such that it compensates for the change in modulus of elasticity of the balance spring.  The compensating balance design of [[Thomas Earnshaw]], which consists simply of a balance wheel with bimetallic rim, became the standard solution for temperature compensation.

===Elinvar===
While the compensating balance was effective as a way to compensate for the effect of temperature on the balance spring, it could not provide a complete solution.  The basic design suffers from "middle temperature error": if the compensation is adjusted to be exact at extremes of temperature, then it will be slightly off at temperatures between those extremes.  Various "auxiliary compensation" mechanisms were designed to avoid this, but they all suffer from being complex and hard to adjust.

Around 1900, a fundamentally different solution was created by [[Charles Édouard Guillaume]], inventor of [[elinvar]].  This is a nickel-steel alloy with the property that the modulus of elasticity is essentially unaffected by temperature.  A watch fitted with an elinvar balance spring requires either no temperature compensation at all, or very little.  This simplifies the mechanism, and it also means that middle temperature error is eliminated as well, or at a minimum is drastically reduced.

==Isochronism==
A balance spring obeys [[Hooke's Law]]: the restoring torque is proportional to the angular displacement.  When this property is exactly satisfied, the balance spring is said to be ''isochronous'', and the period of oscillation is independent of the amplitude of oscillation.  This is an essential property for accurate timekeeping, because no mechanical drive train can provide absolutely constant driving force.  This is particularly true in watches and portable clocks which are powered by a [[mainspring]], which provides a diminishing drive force as it unwinds.    Another cause of varying driving force is friction, which varies as the lubricating oil ages.

Early watchmakers empirically found approaches to make their balance springs isochronous.  For example, [[John Arnold (watchmaker)|John Arnold]] in 1776 patented a helical (cylindrical) form of the balance spring, in which the ends of the spring were coiled inwards.  In 1861 M. Phillips published a theoretical treatment of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;M. Phillips, "Sur le spiral reglant", Paris, 1861.&lt;/ref&gt;  He demonstrated that a balance spring whose [[center of gravity]] coincides with the axis of the balance wheel is isochronous.

In general practice, the most common method of achieving isochronism is through the use of the Breguet overcoil, which places part of the outermost turn of the hairspring in a different plane from the rest of the spring. This allows the hairspring to "breathe" more evenly and symmetrically. Two types of overcoils are found - the gradual overcoil and the Z-Bend. The gradual overcoil is obtained by imposing two gradual twists to the hairspring, forming the rise to the second plane over half the circumference. The Z-bend does this by imposing two kinks of complementary 45 degree angles, accomplishing a rise to the second plane in about three spring section heights. The second method is done for aesthetic reasons and is much more difficult to perform. Due to the difficulty with forming an overcoil, modern watches often use a slightly less effective "dogleg", which uses a series of sharp bends (in plane) to place part of the outermost coil out of the way of the rest of the spring.

==Period of oscillation==
The balance spring and the [[balance wheel]] (which is usually referred to as simply "the balance") form a [[harmonic oscillator]].  The balance spring provides a restoring [[Couple (mechanics)|couple]] that limits and reverses the motion of the balance so it oscillates back and forth.  The motion of the balance is approximately [[simple harmonic motion]], i.e., a sinusoidal motion of constant period.  Its [[Resonance|resonant]] period makes it resistant to changes from perturbing forces, which is what makes it a good timekeeping device.  The stiffness of the spring, its spring coefficient, &lt;math&gt;\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt; in N*m/radian, along with the balance wheel's [[moment of inertia]], &lt;math&gt;I\,&lt;/math&gt; in kg*m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, determines the wheel's  [[oscillation]] [[Frequency|period]] &lt;math&gt;T\,&lt;/math&gt; in seconds:
:&lt;math&gt;T = 2\pi\sqrt{I/\kappa}\,&lt;/math&gt;
This period controls the rate of the timepiece.

'''Biomass heating systems''' generate heat from [[biomass]].&lt;br&gt;
The systems fall under the categories of:
*direct [[combustion]],
*[[gasification]],
*[[combined heat and power]] (CHP),
*[[anaerobic digestion]],
*[[aerobic digestion]].

==Benefits of biomass heating==
The use of biomass in [[heating system]]s is beneficial because it uses agricultural, forest, urban and industrial residues and waste to produce heat and electricity with less effect on the [[Natural environment|environment]] than fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vallios | first1 = I | last2 = Tsoutsos | first2 = T | last3 = Papadakis | first3 = G | year = 2009 | title = Design of Biomass District Heating | url = | journal = Biomass &amp; Bioenergy | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 659–678 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of energy production has a limited long-term effect on the environment because the carbon in biomass is part of the natural [[carbon cycle]]; while the carbon in fossil fuels is not, and permanently adds carbon to the environment when burned for fuel ([[carbon footprint]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Wood Fuelled Heating |url= http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generate-your-own-energy/Wood-fuelled-heating |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716153317/http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generate-your-own-energy/Wood-fuelled-heating |archivedate= 16 July 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, before the use of [[fossil fuels]] in significant quantities, biomass in the form of [[wood fuel]] provided most of humanity's heating.

==Drawbacks of biomass heating==
On a large scale, the use of biomass removes [[agricultural land]] from [[food production]], reduces the [[carbon sequestration]] capacity of forests, and extracts [[soil nutrient|nutrients]] from the soil. Combustion of biomass creates [[air pollutant]]s and adds significant quantities of carbon to the atmosphere that may not be returned to the soil for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/about-us/governance/scientific-committee/sc-opinions/opinions-on-scientific-issues/sc-opinion-on-greenhouse-gas |title=Opinion of the EEA Scientific Committee on Greenhouse Gas Accounting in Relation to Bioenergy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using biomass as a fuel produces air pollution in the form of [[carbon monoxide]], [[NOx]] (nitrogen oxides), VOCs ([[volatile organic compound]]s), particulates and other pollutants, in some cases at levels above those from traditional fuel sources such as coal or natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michiganmessenger.com/33868/proposed-biomass-plant-better-than-coal |title=George Lopez visits the Fox Theatre |publisher=Michigan Messenger |date=22 February 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205080916/http://michiganmessenger.com/33868/proposed-biomass-plant-better-than-coal |archivedate=5 February 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1892127 | pmid=17589590 | doi=10.1289/ehp.9479 | volume=115 | issue=6 | title=Household air pollution from coal and biomass fuels in China: measurements, health impacts, and interventions |date=June 2007 | journal=Environ. Health Perspect. | pages=848–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black carbon]] – a pollutant created by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass – is possibly the second largest contributor to global warming.&lt;ref&gt;''2009 State of the World, Into a Warming World'','''Worldwatch Institute''', 56–57, {{ISBN|978-0-393-33418-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 a Swedish study of the giant brown haze that periodically covers large areas in South Asia determined that it had been principally produced by biomass burning, and to a lesser extent by fossil-fuel burning.&lt;ref&gt;''Science'', '''2009''', 323, 495&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers measured a significant concentration of [[Carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]], which is associated with recent plant life rather than with fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;''Biomass burning leads to Asian brown cloud'', [[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]], '''87''', 4, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

On combustion, the carbon from biomass is released into the atmosphere as [[carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]]. The amount of carbon stored in dry wood is approximately 50% by weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~jcjenkin/smith%20et%20al.%202003.pdf |title=Forest volume-to-biomass models and estimates of mass for live and standing dead trees of U.S. forests |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711174829/http://www.uvm.edu/~jcjenkin/smith%20et%20al.%202003.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; When from agricultural sources, plant matter used as a fuel can be replaced by planting for new growth. When the biomass is from forests, the time to recapture the carbon stored is generally longer, and the carbon storage capacity of the forest may be reduced overall if destructive forestry techniques are employed.&lt;ref name="fao-prasad"&gt;{{cite web|last=Prasad|first=Ram|title=SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT FOR DRY FORESTS OF SOUTH ASIA|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/003/X6895E/x6895e04.htm|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foeitreetr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Treetrouble: Testimonies on the Negative Impact of Large-scale Tree Plantations prepared for the sixth Conference of the Parties of the Framework Convention on Climate Change|url=http://www.foei.org/en/resources/forests/treetrouble.html|publisher=Friends of the Earth International|accessdate=11 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726122033/http://www.foei.org/en/resources/forests/treetrouble.html|archivedate=26 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usda-laihoetal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Impacts of intensive forestry on early rotation trends in site carbon pools in the southeastern US|url=http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/5295|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=11 August 2010|author=Laiho, Raija|author2=Sanchez, Felipe |author3=Tiarks, Allan |author4=Dougherty, Phillip M. |author5= Trettin, Carl C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fao-towsusman"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FEASIBILITY OF SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/003/X4107E/X4107E04.htm#P866_112288|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biomass-is-carbon-neutral proposal put forward in the early 1990s has been superseded by more recent science that recognizes that mature, intact forests sequester carbon more effectively than cut-over areas. When a tree’s carbon is released into the atmosphere in a single pulse, it contributes to climate change much more than woodland timber rotting slowly over decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Biomass heating in our world==
[[File:Olarizu - Casa de la Dehesa - Central de biomasa 01.jpg|thumb|Biomass heating system for one building complex in the Spanish Basque Country]]
The [[oil price increases since 2003]] and consequent price increases for natural gas and coal have increased the value of biomass for heat generation. Forest renderings, agricultural waste, and [[energy crop|crops grown specifically for energy]] production become competitive as the prices of [[Energy density|energy dense]] fossil fuels rise.  Efforts to develop this potential may have the effect of [[Land reclamation#Repairing damaged land|regenerating mismanaged croplands]] and be a cog in the wheel of a decentralized, multi-dimensional [[renewable energy industry]].  Efforts to promote and advance these methods became common throughout the [[European Union]] through the 2000s. In other areas of the world, inefficient and polluting means to generate heat from biomass coupled with poor forest practices have significantly added to [[environmental degradation]].

==Buffer tanks==

Buffer tanks store the hot water the biomass appliance generates and circulates it around the heating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treco.co.uk/products/type/buffertank/2|title=Buffer Tanks and Hot Water Storage - Treco|website=www.treco.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes referred to as 'thermal stores', they are crucial for the efficient operation of all biomass boilers where the system loading fluctuates rapidly, or the volume of water in the complete hydraulic system is relatively small. Using a suitably sized buffer vessel prevents rapid cycling of the boiler when the loading is below the minimum boiler output. Rapid cycling of the boiler causes a large increase in harmful emissions such as [[Carbon monoxide]], dust, and [[NOx]], greatly reduces boiler efficiency and increases electrical consumption of the unit. In addition, service and maintenance requirements will be increased as parts are stressed by rapid heating and cooling cycles. Although most boilers claim to be able to turn down to 30% of nominal output, in the real world this is often not achievable due to differences in the fuel from the 'ideal' or test fuel. A suitably sized buffer tank should therefore be considered where the loading of the boiler drops below 50% of the nominal output – in other words unless the biomass component is purely base load, the system should include a buffer tank. In any case where the secondary system does not contain sufficient water for safe removal of residual heat from the biomass boiler irrespective of the loading conditions, the system must include a suitably sized buffer tank. The [[residual heat]] from a biomass unit varies greatly depending on the boiler design and the thermal mass of the combustion chamber. Light weight, fast response boilers require only 10L/kW, while industrial wet wood units with very high thermal mass require 40L/kW.&lt;ref name="Buffer tanks"&gt;{{cite web |title=Buffer tanks |url= http://www.mbaxterbiomass.co.uk/services/buffer.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of biomass heating systems==
[[File:Biomasseheizwerk Spillern Nordansicht.jpg|thumb|Biomass [[Heat-only boiler station|heating plant]] in Austria; the heat power is about 1000 kW]]

The use of Biomass in heating systems has a use in many different types of buildings, and all have different uses. There are four main types of heating systems that use biomass to heat a boiler. The types are Fully Automated, Semi-Automated, Pellet-Fired, and Combined Heat and Power.

===Fully automated===
In fully automated systems chipped or ground up waste wood is brought to the site by delivery trucks and dropped into a holding tank. A system of conveyors then transports the wood from the holding tank to the boiler at a certain managed rate. This rate is managed by computer controls and a laser that measures the load of fuel the conveyor is bringing in. The system automatically goes on and off to maintain the pressure and temperature within the boiler. Fully automated systems offer a great deal of ease in their operation because they only require the operator of the system to control the computer, and not the transport of wood while offering comprehensive and cost effective solutions to complex industrial challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sigmathermal.com/automation|title=Automation: Combustion Control &amp; Burner Management Systems|newspaper=Sigma Thermal|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Types of Biomass Heating Systems"&gt;{{cite web |title=Types of Biomass Heating Systems |url= http://www.hurstboiler.com/biomass_boiler_systems/heating_system_types/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semi-automated or "surge bin"===
Semi-automated or "Surge Bin" systems are very similar to fully automated systems except they require more manpower to keep operational. They have smaller holding tanks, and a much simpler conveyor systems which will require personnel to maintain the systems operation. The reasoning for the changes from the fully automated system is the efficiency of the system. The heat created by the combustor can be used to directly heat the air or it can be used to heat water in a boiler system which acts as the medium by which the heat is delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://selectedecoenergy.co.uk/biomass-system-design/|title=Biomass System Design - Selected Eco Energy|newspaper=Selected Eco Energy|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood fire fueled boilers are most efficient when they are running at their highest capacity, and the heat required most days of the year will not be the peak heat requirement for the year. Considering that the system will only need to run at a high capacity a few days of the year, it is made to meet the requirements for the majority of the year to maintain its high efficiency.&lt;ref name="Types of Biomass Heating Systems"/&gt;

===Pellet-fired===
The third main type of biomass heating systems are [[Pellet fuel|pellet]]-fired systems. Pellets are a processed form of wood, which make them more expensive. Although they are more expensive, they are much more condensed and uniform, and therefore are more efficient. Further, it is relatively easy to automatically feed pellets to boilers.  In these systems, the pellets are stored in a grain-type storage silo, and gravity is used to move them to the boiler. The storage requirements are much smaller for pellet-fired systems because of their condensed nature, which also helps cut down costs. these systems are used for a wide variety of facilities, but they are most efficient and cost effective for places where space for storage and conveyor systems is limited, and where the pellets are made fairly close to the facility.&lt;ref name="Types of Biomass Heating Systems"/&gt;

====Agricultural pellet systems====
One subcategory of pellet systems are boilers or burners capable of burning pellet with higher ash rate (paper pellets, hay pellets, [[straw pellets]]). One of this kind is PETROJET pellet burner with rotating cylindrical burning chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horakypetrojet.cz/news/great-results-from-swedish-testing-laboratory |title=Great results from Swedish testing laboratory &amp;#124; Petrojet Trade s.r.o |publisher=Horakypetrojet.cz }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In terms of efficiencies advanced pellet boilers can exceed other forms of biomass because of the more stable fuel charataristics. Advanced pellet boilers can even work in condensing mode and cool down combustion gases to 30-40&amp;nbsp;°C, instead of 120&amp;nbsp;°C before sent into the flue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okofen.co.uk/en/pellematic_plus/#tab2|title=Okofen condesing pellet boiler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combined heat and power===
[[Combined heat and power]] systems are very useful systems in which wood waste, such as [[wood chips]], is used to generate power, and heat is created as a byproduct of the power generation system. They have a very high cost because of the high pressure operation. Because of this high pressure operation, the need for a highly trained operator is mandatory, and will raise the cost of operation. Another drawback is that while they produce electricity they will produce heat, and if producing heat is not desirable for certain parts of the year, the addition of a cooling tower is necessary, and will also raise the cost.

There are certain situations where CHP is a good option. Wood product manufacturers would use a combined heat and power system because they have a large supply of waste wood, and a need for both heat and power. Other places where these systems would be optimal are hospitals and prisons, which need energy, and heat for hot water. These systems are sized so that they will produce enough heat to match the average heat load so that no additional heat is needed, and a cooling tower is not needed.&lt;ref name="Types of Biomass Heating Systems"/&gt;

      <comment>Added warning about EGA's use of retrocompact open subsets.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3405">:''For a [[Gödel constructive set]], see [[constructible universe]].''
In [[topology]], a '''constructible set''' in a [[topological space]] is a finite union of [[locally closed set]]s. (A set is locally closed if it is the intersection of an [[open set]] and [[closed set]], or equivalently, if it is open in its closure.) Constructible sets form a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] (i.e., it is closed under finite union and complementation.) In fact, the constructible sets are precisely the Boolean algebra generated by open sets and closed sets; hence, the name "constructible". The notion appears in classical [[algebraic geometry]].

Chevalley's theorem (EGA IV, 1.8.4.) states: Let &lt;math&gt;f: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; be a morphism of finite presentation of schemes. Then the image of any constructible set under ''f'' is constructible. In particular, the image of a variety need not be a variety, but is (under the assumptions) always a constructible set. For example, the map &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A^2 \rightarrow \mathbf A^2&lt;/math&gt; that sends &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(x,xy)&lt;/math&gt; has image the set &lt;math&gt;\{ x \neq 0 \} \cup \{ x=y=0 \}&lt;/math&gt;, which is not a variety, but is constructible.

In any (not necessarily Noetherian) topological space, every constructible set contains a dense open subset of its closure.&lt;ref&gt;Jinpeng An (2012). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/73hg840753675717/ "Rigid geometric structures, isometric actions, and algebraic quotients"]. Geom. Dedicata '''157''': 153–185.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Warning:''' In EGA III, Def.9.1.2, constructible sets are defined using only ''retrocompact'' opens. That is, the family of constructible sets of a topological space is defined as the smallest family closed under finite intersection and complement and containing all ''retrocompact'' open subsets.

So for example, the origin &lt;math&gt;V(x_1, x_2, x_2, \dots)&lt;/math&gt; in the infinite affine space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}^{\infty} = Spec(k[x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots])&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' constructible.

In any locally noetherian topological space, ''all'' subsets are retrocompact (EGA III, 9.1), so the two definitions are the same in this setting.

In [[thermodynamics]], a '''critical point''' (or '''critical state''') is the end point of a phase [[Equilibrium (thermodynamics)|equilibrium]] curve. The most prominent example is the liquid-vapor critical point, the end point of the pressure-temperature curve that designates conditions under which a [[liquid]] and its [[vapor]] can coexist. At higher temperatures, the gas cannot be liquefied by pressure alone. At the critical point, defined by a ''critical temperature'' ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and a ''critical pressure'' ''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, [[phase (matter)|phase]] boundaries vanish. Other examples include the liquid–liquid critical points in mixtures.

== Liquid-vapor critical point ==

=== Overview ===

[[Image:phase-diag2.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|In a typical phase diagram, the boundary between gas and liquid runs from the triple point to the critical point.|The liquid-vapor critical point in a pressure–temperature [[phase diagram]] is at the high-temperature extreme of the liquid–gas phase boundary. The dotted green line shows the anomalous behavior of water.]]

For simplicity and clarity, the generic notion of ''critical point'' is best introduced by discussing a specific example, the liquid-vapor critical point. This was the first critical point to be discovered, and it is still the best known and most studied one.

The figure to the right shows the schematic [[PT diagram]] of a ''pure substance'' (as opposed to mixtures, which have additional state variables and richer phase diagrams, discussed below). The commonly known [[phase (matter)|phase]]s ''solid'', ''liquid'' and ''vapor'' are separated by phase boundaries, i.e. pressure-temperature combinations where two phases can coexist. At the [[triple point]], all three phases can coexist. However, the liquid-vapor boundary terminates in an endpoint at some ''critical temperature'' ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and ''critical pressure'' ''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. This is the ''critical point''.

In water, the critical point occurs at around 647&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] (374&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]] or 705&amp;nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|°F]]) and 22.064&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|MPa]] (3200&amp;nbsp;[[Pounds per square inch|psia]] or 218&amp;nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]).&lt;ref name="Steam 2007"&gt;International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''vicinity'' of the critical point, the physical properties of the liquid and the vapor change dramatically, with both phases becoming ever more similar. For instance, liquid water under normal conditions is nearly incompressible, has a low thermal expansion coefficient, has a high dielectric constant, and is an excellent solvent for electrolytes. Near the critical point, all these properties change into the exact opposite: water becomes compressible, expandable, a poor dielectric, a bad solvent for electrolytes, and prefers to mix with nonpolar gases and organic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;Anisimov, Sengers, [[Anneke Levelt Sengers|Levelt Sengers]] (2004):
Near-critical behavior of aqueous systems.
Chapter 2 in
Aqueous System at Elevated Temperatures and Pressures
Palmer et al, eds.
Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

''At'' the critical point, only one phase exists. The [[heat of vaporization]] is zero. There is a [[stationary point|stationary]] [[inflection point]] in the constant-temperature line (''critical isotherm'') on a [[PV diagram]]. This means that at the critical point:&lt;ref name=Atkins&gt;P. Atkins and J. de Paula, Physical Chemistry, 8th ed. (W.H. Freeman 2006), p.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.J. Laidler and J.H. Meiser, Physical Chemistry (Benjamin/Cummings 1982), p.27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.A. Rock, Chemical Thermodynamics (MacMillan 1969), p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial V}\right)_T  = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial^2p}{\partial V^2}\right)_T=0&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Real Gas Isotherms.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|The ''critical isotherm'' with the critical point&amp;nbsp;K]]

''Above'' the critical point there exists a state of matter that is continuously connected with (can be transformed without phase transition into) both the liquid and the gaseous state. It is called [[supercritical fluid]]. The common textbook knowledge that all distinction between liquid and vapor disappears beyond the critical point has been challenged by [[Michael Fisher|Fisher]] and [[Benjamin Widom|Widom]]&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Widom: ''Decay of Correlations in Linear Systems'', J. Chem Phys 50, 3756 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; who identified a p,T-line that separates states with different asymptotic statistical properties ([[Fisher-Widom line]]).

=== History ===

[[Image:Critical carbon dioxide.jpg|thumb|right|critical carbon dioxide|[[Carbon dioxide]] exuding [[fog]] while cooling from supercritical to critical temperature]]

The existence of a critical point was first discovered by [[Charles Cagniard de la Tour]] in 1822&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Charles Cagniard de la Tour |date=1822 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rzNCAAAAcAAJ&amp;vq=Cagniard&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Exposé de quelques résultats obtenu par l'action combinée de la chaleur et de la compression sur certains liquides, tels que l'eau, l'alcool, l'éther sulfurique et l'essence de pétrole rectifiée |trans-title=Presentation of some results obtained by the combined action of heat and compression on certain liquids, such as water, alcohol, sulfuric ether (i.e., diethyl ether), and distilled petroleum spirit |journal=Annales de chimie et de physique |volume=21 |pages=127–132 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berche, B., Henkel, M., Kenna, R (2009) Critical phenomena: 150 years since Cagniard de la Tour. Journal of Physical Studies 13 (3), pp. 3001-1-3001-4.&lt;/ref&gt; and named by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] in 1860&lt;ref&gt;Landau, Lifshitz, Theoretical Physics Vol V, Statistical Physics, Ch. 83 [German edition 1984]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Andrews (scientist)|Thomas Andrews]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Andrews, Thomas |date=1869 |url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/159/575.full.pdf+html |title=The Bakerian lecture: On the continuity of the gaseous and liquid states of matter |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |location=London |volume=159 |pages=575–590}} The term "critical point" appears on page 588.&lt;/ref&gt; Cagniard showed that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could be liquefied at 31&amp;nbsp;°C at a pressure of 73 atm, but not at a slightly higher temperature, even under pressures as high as 3,000 atm.

=== Theory ===

Solving the above condition &lt;math&gt;(\partial p / \partial V)_T=0&lt;/math&gt; for the [[van der Waals equation]], one can compute the critical point as 
:&lt;math&gt;T_c = \frac{8a}{27Rb},\ V_c = 3nb,\ p_c = \frac a {27b^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
However, the van der Waals equation, based on a [[mean field theory]], does not hold near the critical point. In particular, it predicts wrong [[scaling law]]s.

To analyse properties of fluids near the critical point, reduced state variables are sometimes defined relative to the critical properties&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Cengel | first1 = Yunus A. | last2 = Boles | first2 = Michael A. | title = Thermodynamics: an engineering approach | year = 2002 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = Boston  | isbn = 0-07-121688-X | pages =  91–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T_r = \frac T {T_c},\ p_r = \frac p {p_c},\ V_r = \frac{V}{RT_c/p_c}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[theorem of corresponding states|principle of corresponding states]] indicates that substances at equal reduced pressures and temperatures have equal reduced volumes. This relationship is approximately true for many substances, but becomes increasingly inaccurate for large values of ''p&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''.

For some gases, there is an additional correction factor, called ''Newton's correction'', added to the critical temperature and critical pressure calculated in this manner. These are empirically derived values and vary with the pressure range of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Compressibility Chart for Hydrogen and Inert Gases |first1= Frank D. |last1= Maslan |first2= Theodore M. |last2= Littman |journal= Ind.

==Mixtures: liquid–liquid critical point==

[[Image:LCST-UCST plot.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A plot of typical polymer solution phase behavior including two critical points: an [[LCST]] and a [[Upper critical solution temperature|UCST]].]]
The [[Liquid-liquid critical point|liquid–liquid critical point]] of a solution, which occurs at the ''critical solution temperature'', occurs at the limit of the two-phase region of the phase diagram. In other words, it is the point at which an infinitesimal change in some thermodynamic variable (such as temperature or pressure) will lead to separation of the mixture into two distinct liquid phases, as shown in the polymer–solvent phase diagram to the right. Two types of liquid–liquid critical points are the [[upper critical solution temperature]] (UCST), which is the hottest point at which cooling will induce phase separation, and the [[lower critical solution temperature]] (LCST), which is the coldest point at which heating will induce phase separation.

===Mathematical definition===

From a theoretical standpoint, the liquid–liquid critical point represents the temperature-concentration extremum of the [[spinodal]] curve (as can be seen in the figure to the right). Thus, the liquid–liquid critical point in a two-component system must satisfy two conditions: the condition of the spinodal curve (the ''second'' derivative of the [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] with respect to concentration must equal zero), and the extremum condition (the ''third'' derivative of the free energy with respect to concentration must also equal zero or the derivative of the spinodal temperature with respect to concentration must equal zero).

'''DIGI '''('''Teraoka/DIGI Group''') is a global [[corporation]] with offices in [[Japan]], [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. Founded in 1934, it supplies weighing and packaging equipment for [[trade]], [[industries]], and [[logistics]]. Its products are widely used in the [[manufacturing]], [[retail]], and [[consumer]] fields. The company occupies 30% of the Russian market of weighing scales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tovr.ru/food/articles/1684/28351/ российского рынка системных торговых весов]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the company dates back to 1934, its activity dates back to 1910, when industrialist Teraoka Toyonaru created the Japan Calculation Machinery Manufacturing Co, which was focused on [[Innovation|innovative]] technologies and supporting [[Inventor|inventions]]. It produced precision instruments for industries and consumers. At the time of its inception, Teraoka had already developed [[Weighing scale|weight scales]] capable of functioning under different temperature environments, which had been [[patent]]ed in Japan, the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]] and [[France]]. Establishing itself firmly in its market,  Teraoka Takeharu, son of Toyonaru, started the Teraoka Research Center (Teraoka Seiko Co., Ltd.), which would eventually form part of Teraoka/DIGI Group. The corporation presently operates five [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] centres and five production sites across Europe and Asia, as well as its own line of [[strain gauges]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9449">'''Dislocation avalanches''' are rapid discreet events during plastic deformation, in which defects are reorganized collectively. This intermittent flow behavior has been observed in microcrystals, whereas macroscopic plasticity appears as a smooth process. Intermittent plastic flow has been observed in several different systems. In AlMg Alloys, interaction between solute and dislocations can cause sudden jump during dynamic strain aging&lt;ref name="AlMg"&gt;Lebyodkin, M. A., and Y. Estrin. "Multifractal analysis of the Portevin–Le Chatelier effect: General approach and application to AlMg and AlMg/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; alloys." Acta materialia 53.12 (2005): 3403-3413.&lt;/ref&gt;. In metallic glass, it can be observed via shear banding with stress localization&lt;ref&gt;Wang, G., et al. "Self-organized intermittent plastic flow in bulk metallic glasses." Acta Materialia 57.20 (2009): 6146-6155.&lt;/ref&gt;; and single crystal plasticity, it shows up as slip burst&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Nir, et al. "Statistics of dislocation slip avalanches in nanosized single crystals show tuned critical behavior predicted by a simple mean field model." Physical review letters 109.9 (2012): 095507.&lt;/ref&gt;. However, analysis of the events with orders-magnitude difference in sizes with different crystallographic structure reveals power-law scaling between the number of events and their magnitude, or scale-free flow&lt;ref&gt;Dimiduk, Dennis M., et al. "Scale-free intermittent flow in crystal plasticity." Science 312.5777 (2006): 1188-1190.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

This microscopic instability of plasticity can have profound consequences on mechanical behavior of microcrystals. The increased relative size of the fluctuations makes it difficult to control the plastic forming process&lt;ref name="simulation"&gt;Csikor, Ferenc F., et al. "Dislocation avalanches, strain bursts, and the problem of plastic forming at the micrometer scale." Science 318.5848 (2007): 251-254.&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, at small specimen sizes the yield stress is not well defined by the 0.2% plastic strain criterion anymore, since this value varies specimen by specimen&lt;ref&gt;Brinckmann, Steffen, Ju-Young Kim, and Julia R. Greer. "Fundamental differences in mechanical behavior between two types of crystals at the nanoscale." Physical review letters 100.15 (2008): 155502.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Similar intermittent effects has been studied in many completely different systems, including intermittency of energy dissipation in magnetism([[Barkhausen effect]]), superconductivity, earthquakes, and friction&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Daniel S. "Collective transport in random media: from superconductors to earthquakes." Physics reports 301.1 (1998): 113-150.&lt;/ref&gt;.
==Background==
[[File:Slip bands.jpg|thumb|Slip bands formation near a grain boundary. The dashed lines stand for slip planes]]
Macroscopic plasticity are well-described by continuum model. Dislocations motions are characterized by an average velocity
:&lt;math&gt; \tau = \rho b \bar{v} &lt;/math&gt;
which is known as Orowan's equation. However, this approach completely fails to account for well-known intermittent deformation phenomena such as the spatial localization of dislocation flow into “slip bands” &lt;ref&gt;Ewing, J. A., and Walter Rosenhain. "Bakerian Lecture: The Crystalline Structure of Metals." Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Containing Papers of a Mathematical or Physical Character 193 (1900): 353-375.&lt;/ref&gt;(also known as [[Lüders band]]) and the temporal fluctuations in stress-strain curves (the [[Portevin–Le Chatelier effect]] first reported in the 1920s)&lt;ref&gt;A. Portevin, F. Le Chatelier." CR Acad. Sci. Paris 176 (1923): 507.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlMg" /&gt;.












==Experimental Approach==
Although evidence of intermittent flow behavior is long known and studied, it is not until past two decades that a quantitative understanding of the phenomenon is developed with help of novel experimental techniques. 
===Acoustic emission===
[[Acoustic emission]] (AE) is used to record the crackling noise from deforming crystals&lt;ref&gt;Miguel, M., et al. "Intermittent dislocation flow in viscoplastic deformation." Nature 410.6829(2001): 667-671.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Jérôme, and David Marsan. "Three-dimensional mapping of dislocation avalanches: clustering and space/time coupling." Science 299.5603 (2003): 89-92.&lt;/ref&gt;. The amplitudes of the acoustic signals can be related to the area swept by the fast-moving dislocations and hence to the energy dissipated during deformation events. The result shows that cracking noise is not smooth, with no specific energy scale. Effect of grain structure for “supercritical” flow has been studied in polycrystalline ice&lt;ref&gt;Richeton, Thiebaud, Jérôme Weiss, and François Louchet. "Breakdown of avalanche critical behaviour in polycrystalline plasticity." Nature materials 4.6 (2005): 465.&lt;/ref&gt;.  
===Direct mechanical measurement===
Recent developments in small scale mechanical testing, with sub-nm resolution in displacement and sub-μN resolution in force, now allow to directly study discrete events in stress and strain. Currently, the most prominent method is a miniaturized compression experiment, where a nanoindenter equipped with a flat indentation tip is used. Equipped with in-situ techniques in combination with [[Transmission electron microscopy]] (TEM), [[Scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM), and micro-diffraction methods, this nanomechanical testing method can give us rich detail in nanoscale plasticity instabilities in real time. 

One potential concern in nanomechanical measurement is: how fast can the system respond? Can indentation tip remain contact with the sample and track the deformation? Since dislocation velocity is strongly effected by stress, velocity can be many orders different in different systems. Also, multiscale nature of dislocation avalanche event gives dislocation velocity a large range. For example, single dislocations have been shown to move at speeds of ∼10 ms&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in pure Cu, but dislocation groups moved with ∼10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; ms&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in Cu-0.5%Al. The opposite is found for iron, where dislocation groups are found to move six orders of magnitude faster in a FeSi-alloy than individual dislocations in pure iron.

To resolve this issue, Sparks et al. has designed an experiment to measure first fracture of Si beam and compare with theoretical prediction to determine the respond speed of the system&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, G., et al. "Spatiotemporal slip dynamics during deformation of gold micro-crystals." Acta Materialia 122 (2017): 109-119.&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to regular compression experiments, in-situ electrical contact resistance measurements (ECR) were performed. During these in-situ tests, a constant voltage was applied during the deformation experiment to record current evolution during intermittent plastic flow. Result shows that indentation tip remains contact with the sample throughout experiments, which proves the respond speed is fast enough. 
==Theoretical analysis and simulations==
Avalanche strain distributions have the general form&lt;ref name="simulation" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; P(s)= C s^{-\tau} exp[-(s/s_0) ^2] &lt;/math&gt;
where C is a normalization constant, t is a scaling exponent, and s&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the characteristic strain of the largest avalanches.

Dislocation dynamic simulation has shown that &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is close to 1.5, which is in good agreement with mean-field theory prediction&lt;ref&gt;Zaiser, Michael, and Paolo Moretti. "Fluctuation phenomena in crystal plasticity—a continuum model." Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment 2005.08 (2005): P08004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaiser, Michael. "Scale invariance in plastic flow of crystalline solids." Advances in physics 55.1-2 (2006): 185-245.&lt;/ref&gt;. Simulation results also revealed the scale free nature of dislocation avalanches and concluded that deformation of crystals having highly mobile dislocations exhibits the attributes of a self-organized critical (SOC) process.
==Effect of crystal structure on dislocation avalanches==
In FCC crystal, scaled velocity shows a main peak in distribution with relatively smooth curve, which is expected from theory except for some disagreement at low velocity. However, in BCC crystal, distribution of scaled velocity is broader and much more dispersed&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Gregory, et al. "Shapes and velocity relaxation of dislocation avalanches in fcc and bcc crystals." arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06636 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;. The result also shows that scaled velocity in BCC is a lot slower than FCC, which is not predicted by mean field theory. A possible explanation this discrepancy is based on different moving speed of edge and screw dislocations in two type of crystals. In FCC crystals, two parts of dislocation move at same velocity, resulting in smooth averaged avalanches profile; whereas in BCC crystals, edge components move fast and escape rapidly, while screw parts propagate slowly, which drag the overall velocity. Based on this explanation, we will also expect a direction dependence of avalanche events in HCP crystals, which currently lack in experimental data.

The '''earth pyramids of Platten''' (German: ''Erdpyramiden von Platten'' or ''Erdpyramiden bei Oberwielenbach''; {{lang-it|Piramidi di Plata}} {{IPA-it|piˈraːmidi di ˈplaːta|}}) are [[Hoodoo (geology)|earth pyramids]] located in Platten in the municipality of [[Percha]], near [[Bruneck]] in [[South Tyrol]], [[Italy]].

The erosion area is located at an altitude of 1550 to 1750 meters. What is so impressive about the pyramids of Platten is their wildness which reminds at the same time also of their fragility.

The pyramids of Platten belong to the most beautiful natural monuments of South Tyrol such as the [[earth pyramids of Ritten]] and part of the [[earth pyramids of South Tyrol]].

They were described in a scientific manner for the first time by Karl Meusburger in 1914 .&lt;ref&gt;Karl Meusburger, ''Die Erdpyramiden bei Bruneck'' (''The earth pyramides near Bruneck'', in "Zeitschrift des Ferdinandeums für Tirol und Vorarlberg" (Journal of the [[Tyrolean State Museum|Ferdinandeum]] for Tyrol and Vorarlberg, III/58, 1914, pp. 453-455.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following a cloudburst, a few centuries ago, there came a landslide which cut off the roads connecting the villages in the surroundings of Aschbach.

In 1882, again after a heavy cloudburst, a  new fault was formed. Following eluviations and erosions these earth
pyramids are constantly changing; that is due to the succession of severe cold spells in winter and hot summers which have the effect of continually forming new ones.

==Getting There and Hiking Route==
From the main road we deter at Percha/Percia and drive less than 6&amp;nbsp;km up into Oberwielenbach and beyond it a bit more to the big parking place. That road continues to the hamlet of Platten, but before reaching it, another narrow mountain road deters left, heading towards the Gönner Alm (alpine pasture). On the crossroads there's the inscription that this mountain road leads also towards the pyramids, but it is closed for public traffic (2017). So, it's best to start the walk up to the pyramids before, on the big parking place, 1430 m, or eventually later, from Platten.

From the big parking place, 1430 m, a good, marked path goes up into the woods. First it ascends a bit, then does a lot of crossing the slopes towards the right. When we reach out of the woods, hitting the before mentioned mountain road, we follow the road only to the big left turn. From there we go into the forest again and in a few minutes we reach the big ravine with the pyramids. Some 30 minutes till here.

To return, it is best to use the approach route, even if we descend along the ravine to the lower lookout point. From there a path goes further down, but it descends more than needed and makes the return a bit longer.

The '''Electrical Trades Union of Australia''' (ETU) is a [[trade union]] in [[Australia]] which has a history stretching back over 100 years. In its modern form the ETU is a division of the [[Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union of Australia|Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union]] (CEPU), although it is possibly the most well known of the three divisions. At a state registered level, the union often exists as a separately registered union as for example it does in [[Queensland]].

On 24 December 1919 Electrical Trades Union of Australia federally re-registered under the [[Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904]] as an association of employees. This date is now taken as the official registration date of the Federal Union.

Whilst being a part of the CEPU the union has carved out for itself a unique identity. It is well known for its [[Militant (word)|militant]] attitude. Its members have long memories and openly berated [[Peter Beattie]] for giving former [[Queensland]] premier [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] a state funeral. The Bjelke-Petersen government had sacked ETU members working at SEQEB in 1985 during a bitter dispute over the privatization of work normally done by SEQEB employees. Like other trade unions of the [[left wing|left]] in Australia it has adopted the [[Eureka Flag]] as one of its logos.

In the lead-up to the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]], the Victorian ETU withdrew its support for the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]], citing Labor's refusal to scrap laws restricting union action on building sites.&lt;ref&gt;ABC news [http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/20/2958632.htm/ "Victorian ETU cuts ties with Labor"] Retrieved on 17 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since then it has rejoined in the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;The Australian [https://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/victoria-etu-moves-to-reaffiliate-with-labor/news-story/d3202a0b5193517d69ab33f81b7b39e3 "Victoria ETU moves to reaffiliate with Labor"] Retrieved on 21 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Canberra Times [https://www.canberratimes.com.au/politics/act/etu-to-stick-with-right-faction-as-fallout-from-pettersson-defection-continues-20180813-p4zx65.html "ETU to stick with right faction as fallout from Pettersson defection continues
"] Retrieved on 21 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally the ETU has sided with the [[Labor Left]] or equivalent faction in the state branches of the ALP with the notable exception of the ACT, where it aligns with the Centre Coalition ([[Labor Right]]) faction. It enjoys a close relationship there with the [[Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association]] (SDA) and the [[Australian Workers Union]] (AWU). Despite reaffiliating with Victorian Labor, in the leadup to the [[Victorian state election, 2018|2018 Victorian Election]] the ETU donated $50,000 towards a competing party, the [[Victorian Socialists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unions back Victorian Socialists’ campaign |url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/unions-back-victorian-socialists-campaign/news-story/a70e35c22fb409de8f479acefc06a7ff?nk=8cda7c7c17126dd58856ca055576a5f7-1539687875 |website=www.theaustralian.com.au |accessdate=16 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror''''' ({{ISBN|0-89526-066-2}}, 2004) is a book by Lt.General [[Thomas McInerney]], US Air Force, and Major General [[Paul E. Vallely]], US Army, with forward remarks by CIA Director James Woolsey. It describes a super secret weapon system that is intended to neutralize nuclear weapons.

" I call upon the scientific community in our country, those who gave us nuclear weapons, to turn their talents now to the cause of mankind and world peace, to give us the means of rendering those weapons impotent and obsolete."

--President Ronald Reagan, Address to the Nation, March 23, 1983 

The book states:

:''"In Rowan Scarborough’s book, Rumsfeld’s War, it was revealed that the Israeli defense forces have eighty-two nuclear weapons as part of their nuclear deterrence force. In our research for this book we discovered that a group of countries, led by [[Israel]], the [[United States|U.S.]] and Italy, had been working since 1981 on a mega-secret project to develop and deploy a weapon system that can neutralize nuclear weapons. The highly advanced, space-deployed, BHB weapon system, code-named ''XXXBHB-BACAR-1318-I390MSCH'', has extraordinary potential and is the key part of the West’s deterrence strategy. For the past twenty-five years, the project and the scientists involved in it were kept in strict secrecy and their existence denied. 

In 1981, when president Ronald Reagan and [[CIA]] director [[William J. Casey]] agreed and signed onto the [[Strategic Defense Initiative|SDI]] (Strategic Defense Initiative) — a missile defense shield against incoming nuclear warheads — they gave the green light for the secret development of the BHB weapon for deterrence purposes and peaceful use only. Although we have only limited information, it appears that [[Iran]]’s rapidly developing nuclear capabilities could be neutralized and rendered obsolete, as could the capabilities of other rogue countries."'''{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

[[File:Enercell Batteries.jpg|thumb|Two [[AA battery|AA]] RadioShack Enercell [[Alkaline battery|alkaline]] batteries, as they appeared between the late 90's and mid-2000's.]]
'''Enercell''' is a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] brand that was sold exclusively by [[RadioShack]] at retail stores and online. 

In a "battery of the month club" promotion introduced in the 1960s and abandoned in the early 1990s, RadioShack clients were issued a free wallet-sized cardboard card which entitled the bearer to one free battery a month when presented in RadioShack stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19691124&amp;id=N94jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MSgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1292,2214851|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal|type=print advertisement| page=8|publicationdate=November 24, 1969|accessdate=2016-02-11|title=Radio Shack Grand Opening|via=news.google.com}}{{Dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The free Enercells were individual [[AA battery|AA]], [[C battery|C]] or [[D battery|D]] cells or [[Nine-volt battery|9V]] rectangular transistor radio batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Memories of a Radio Shack addict|url = http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/02/06/memories-of-a-radio-shack-addict/|website = SiliconANGLE|accessdate = 2016-02-11|language = en|first=David|last=Coursey | date=Feb 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the free tube testing offered in-store in the early 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&amp;dat=19730118&amp;id=DMhdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eF4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4048,2396113&amp;hl=en|newspaper= Observer-Reporter|page=13|publicationdate=Jan 18, 1973|accessdate=2016-02-11|type=print advertisement|title=Radio Shack Grand Opening|via=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; this small [[loss leader]] drew foot traffic.

There were two editions of a "Enercell Battery Guidebook", published in 1985 and 1990.

'''Energy4All''' facilitates the creation and development of [[wind turbine cooperative]]s in the United Kingdom, based on the experienced gained in the creation of the UK's first wind co-op, [[Baywind Energy Co-operative]]. It has gone on to raise at least £6million on behalf of the co-operatives, through community share offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kidd|first1=Marie-Claire|title=Energy co-op embarks on multi-million pound share offer|url=http://www.thenews.coop/86188/news/energy/energy-co-op-embarks-on-most-ambitious-share-offer-yet/|accessdate=19 June 2014|work=The Co-operative News|publisher=The Co-operative Press|date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst not technically a [[co-operative]] itself, the organisation has helped create at least ten wind co-ops, including [[Westmill Wind Farm Co-operative]] and [[Boyndie]] Wind Farm Co-operative, who, along with Baywind, own Energy4All.

One of the co-operatives it has created, Energy Prospects Co-operative, specialises in taking early stage wind co-operatives through the development and [[planning application]] stages to the point where a community share offer, managed by Energy4All, can be launched to fund the project.

They won an [[Ashden Award]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy4All, UK communities take ownership of sustainable energy|url=http://www.ashden.org/winners/energy4all12|website=Ashden Awards 2012|publisher=Ashden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IEC 61400''' is an International Standard published by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] regarding [[wind turbine]]s.

== Purpose and function ==
The 61400 is a set of design requirements made to ensure that wind turbines are appropriately engineered against damage from hazards within the planned lifetime. The standard concerns most aspects of the turbine life from site conditions before construction, to turbine components being tested,&lt;ref name=woeb&gt;Woebbeking, Mike. [http://www.gl-group.com/pdf/IEC_TS_61400-22_Woeb.pdf "IEC TS 61400-22"] pages 1-2 and 9 ''[[Germanischer Lloyd]]'', 2008. Accessed: 12 March 2011. [https://web.archive.org/web/20130512191845/http://www.gl-group.com/pdf/IEC_TS_61400-22_Woeb.pdf Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; assembled and operated.

Wind turbines are capital intensive, and are usually purchased before they are being erected and [[Project commissioning|commissioned]].

Some of these standards provide technical conditions verifiable by an [[certification body|independent, third party]], and as such are necessary in order to make business agreements so wind turbines can be financed and erected.&lt;ref name=woeb/&gt;

IEC started standardizing international certification on the subject in 1995, and the first standard appeared in 2001.&lt;ref name=woeb/&gt;

The common set of standards sometimes replace the various national standards, forming a basis for global certification.&lt;ref name=woeb/&gt;

Small wind turbines are defined as being of up to 200 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; swept area and a somewhat simplified IEC 61400-2 standard addresses these. It is also possible to use the IEC 61400-1 standard for turbines of less than 200 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; swept area.

The standards for loads and noise are used in the development of prototypes at the [[Østerild Wind Turbine Test Field]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sebrochure.dk/DTU_Vindenergi_UK/MailView/ Østerild brochure], page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harmonization==
[[File:US certification standards for offshore wind turbines.jpg|thumb|IEC, API, ISO etc. standards used to certify US offshore wind turbines]]
In the U.S., standards are intended to be compatible with IEC standards,&lt;ref name=dodge&gt;Dodge, Darrell M.

Accessed: 20 November 2013. {{osti|1078076}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Canada, the previous national standards were outdated and impeded the wind industry, and they were updated and harmonized with 61400 by the [[Canadian Standards Association]] with several modifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca.energy/files/pdf/eneene/pdf/tirdrdti-eng.pdf "Updated standards propel wind energy development"] page 23, ''[[Natural Resources Canada]]'' 2010.

An update for IEC 61400 is scheduled for 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energiwatch.dk/Energinyt/Renewables/article8091122.ece |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007095835/http://energiwatch.dk/Energinyt/Renewables/article8091122.ece |title=Kæmpemøller får ny håndbog i Takt og Tone |archivedate=7 October 2015|work=EnergiWatch |accessdate=7 October 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For small wind turbines the global industry has been working towards harmonisation of certification requirements with a "test once, certify everywhere" objective. Considerable co-operation has been taking place between UK, USA, and more recently Japan, Denmark and other countries so that the IEC 61400-2 standard as interpreted within e.g. the MCS certification scheme (of UK origin) is interoperable with the USA (for example where it corresponds to an AWEA small wind turbine standard) and other countries.

==Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) classes==
Wind turbines are designed for specific conditions. During the construction and design phase assumptions are made about the wind climate that the wind turbines will be exposed to. Turbine wind class is just one of the factors needing consideration during the complex process of planning a wind power plant. Wind classes determine which turbine is suitable for the normal wind conditions of a particular site. Turbine classes are determined by three parameters - the average wind speed, extreme 50-year gust, and turbulence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vestas.com/en/wind-power-plants/wind-project-planning/siting/wind-classes.aspx#/vestas-univers "Wind project planning: Wind turbine classes"] ''[[Vestas]]''. Accessed October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Turbulence intensity quantifies how much the wind varies typically within 10 minutes. Because the fatigue loads of a number of major components in a wind turbine are mainly caused by turbulence, the knowledge of how turbulent a site is of crucial importance. Normally the wind speed increases with increasing height. In flat terrain the wind speed increases [[logarithmically]] with height. In complex terrain the wind profile is not a simple increase and additionally a separation of the flow might occur, leading to heavily increased turbulence.&lt;ref&gt;Langreder, Wiebke. [http://www.wwindea.org/technology/ch02/en/2_4_1.html "Siting of Wind Farms: Basic Aspects"] [[Suzlon Energy]]. Accessed October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The extreme wind speeds are based on the 3 second average wind speed. Turbulence is measured at 15&amp;nbsp;m/s wind speed. This is the definition in IEC 61400-1 edition 2.

For U.S. waters however, several [[hurricane]]s have already exceeded wind class Ia with speeds above the 70 m/s (156 mph), and efforts are being made to provide suitable standards.&lt;ref name=musial/&gt;

[[File:Portland Urban Iditarod.jpg|thumb|Costumed participants in the Urban Idiotarod race over the Burnside Bridge in shopping carts]]The '''Idiotarod''' is a [[shopping cart]] [[Racing|race]] in which teams of five "[[Idiot (usage)|idiot]]s" tie themselves to a (sometimes modified) [[grocery store]] shopping cart and run through the streets of a major [[Metropolitan Statistical Area|metropolitan area]].  The race usually features people in [[costume]]s and themed [[Float (parade)|float]]s.  The races are fun competitions where sabotage, costume, and presentation are rewarded. Sabotage, such as tripping competitors, throwing marbles or large obstacles in their paths, and the spreading of misinformation such as false route information, is common.

The Idiotarod is named after the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race|Iditarod]], a 1,000 mile dog-sledding race in Alaska.

Idiotarods take place in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Dallas]], [[Denver]], [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]], [[New York City]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Salt Lake City]], [[Seattle]], [[St. Louis]],  [[Toronto]],  [[Los Angeles]], [[Vancouver]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] though the original race was founded in [[San Francisco]] in 1994 as the  "Urban Iditarod".&lt;ref name="sfw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2001-03-07/news/s-f-mush/|title=S.F.

==Chicago, Illinois==
Chicago's Urban Iditarod or '''Chiditarod''', has been held annually on the first Saturday in March since 2006. Historically the race has occurred in and around the Chicago neighborhood of [[West Town, Chicago|West Town]]. Much like other Urban Iditarods, a [[Chiditarod]] team includes 5 participants: 4 dawgs and a musher. Teams are required to use a regular [[shopping cart]] and are not allowed to modify the cart's original [[caster]] wheels. Beyond this limitation, teams are encouraged to take artistic liberties with their carts and participants often decorate their carts in highly creative ways and dress in costume to match their team's theme. Like a traditional race, teams compete to finish the course in as little time as possible, while making designated stops at checkpoints along the course. Participating teams are allowed and even encouraged to sabotage each other in order to gain advantage but most teams engage in sabotage merely for bragging rights. In the spirit of radical inclusion, the Chiditarod organizers hand out a number of awards in a variety of categories giving participants the freedom to compete in the fields they are best suited for.

The landmark of the Chiditarod is the event's charitable aspect. Billing itself as "Probably the world's largest mobile food drive," the Chiditarod plays an important role in helping raise foods for Chicago's food depositories. Teams are asked to donate a minimum amount of high protein, non perishable food items. Another notable innovation is the organization's approach to self-policing. In an effort to keep all participants safe throughout the course, the Chiditarod deploys [[bike marshals]] who act as roaming course deputies: resolving disputes between teams, mitigating destructive sabotage, safeguarding participant conduct and lending a helping hand whenever necessary.

==Trademark claim==
In 2014, the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]] sent a cease-and-desist order to Idiotarod NYC, asserting that the name "Idiotarod" infringed its trademark in "Iditarod."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bleier|first=Evan|title=Iditarod sends 'Idiotarod' a cease-and-desist letter|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1009481-iditarod-cease-and-desist-letter-to-idiotarod.html/|accessdate=January 27, 2014|newspaper=UPI|date=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite letter |url =https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1009481-iditarod-cease-and-desist-letter-to-idiotarod.html |subject = Cease And Desist Demand |last= Dawson |first=Jon S |recipient =Idiotarod NYC |date=January 21, 2014 |accessdate = January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Idiotarod NYC characterized the letter as "frivolous threats of legal action", but renamed the event to "Idiotarodorama NYC (aka 'The Desistarod')".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Seelie |first=Tod |title=Idiotarod Forced To Change Name, Still Happening Saturday |url=http://gothamist.com/2014/01/24/idiotarod_forced_to_change_name_sti.php |accessdate=January 27, 2014 |newspaper=The Gothamist |date=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128011752/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/24/idiotarod_forced_to_change_name_sti.php |archivedate=January 28, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inertial Response''' is a property of large [[synchronous generator]]s, which contain large synchronous rotating masses, and which acts to overcome the immediate imbalance between power supply and demand for electric power systems, typically the [[electrical grid]].  Due to the ever existing power imbalance between mechanical power supply and electric power demand the rotational frequency of the rotating masses in all sychronous generators in the grid either speed up (excess power supply) or slow down (excess power demand). This enables the grid operator to rebalance the system in order to stop the speed change, resulting in a relatively small variation in  [[Utility frequency|AC frequency]] ideally within the allowable frequency range of that system.  i.e. A 50&amp;nbsp;Hz system may allow a ±0.5&amp;nbsp;Hz deviation in the frequency of the AC voltage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AEMO:  Wind Integration Study|url=http://www.aemo.com.au/planning/wind_integration_investigation.html|publisher=AEMO|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The grid frequency is the combined result of the detailed motions of all individual synchronous rotors in the grid, which are modeled by a general equation of motion called the [[Swing Equation]].

== Simulating power balancing with windpower ==

When the grid frequency is too high or too low, active power flow through the [[high-voltage direct current]] link will be ramped down or up. In turn, the [[Wind turbine|wind generation]] will increase or decrease the [[Blade pitch|blade angles]] to reduce or increase the captured wind power through pitch control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miao|first=Zhixin |author2=Lingling Fan |author3=Osborn, D. |author4=Yuvarajan, S. |title=Wind Farms With HVdc Delivery in Inertial Response and Primary Frequency Control .|journal=Energy Conversions|date=Dec 2010|volume=25|issue=4|pages=1171–1178|doi=10.1109/TEC.2010.2060202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7522">'''Information-theoretic death''' is the scrambling of information within a [[brain]] to such an extent that recovery of the original person becomes theoretically impossible.

Information-theoretic death is an attempt to define death in a way that is permanent and independent of any future medical advances, no matter how distant or improbable that may be.

Because detailed reading or restoration of information-storing brain structures is well beyond current technology, it is generally not of practical importance in "mainstream medicine",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Connectome: How the Brain's Wiring Makes Us Who We Are |author=[[Sebastian Seung]] |publisher=Houghton Mifflin | year = 2012| pages = 271| isbn=9780547678597| url=https://books.google.com/?id=GXwEuoYl3wQC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;q=%22information-theoretic%20death%22| quote=Merkle's definition of death is of more philosophical than practical importance. To apply it, we need to know exactly how memories, personality, and other aspects of personal identity are stored in the brain.}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is of great importance in [[cryonics]], where consideration of future technology is important.

[[Ralph Merkle]] defined information-theoretic death as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Merkle R, |title=The technical feasibility of cryonics |journal=Medical Hypotheses |volume=39 | issue=1 |pages=6–16 |date=September 1992 | pmid=1435395 | doi=10.1016/0306-9877(92)90133-W |url=http://www.merkle.com/cryo/techFeas.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|A person is dead according to the [[information theory|information theoretic]] criterion if their [[memory|memories]], [[personality]], hopes, dreams, etc. have been destroyed in the information theoretic sense. If the structures in the brain that [[memory encoding|encode memory]] and personality have been so disrupted that it is no longer possible in principle to recover them, then the person is dead. If they are sufficiently intact that inference of the state of memory and personality are feasible in principle, and therefore restoration to an appropriate functional state is likewise feasible in principle, then the person ''is not dead.''}}

So defined, information-theoretic death has been called "the ultimate definition of [[Irreversible process|irreversible]] death",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cerullo MA |title=The Ethics of Exponential Life Extension Through Brain Preservation |journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology| volume=26 | issue=1 |pages=94–105 |date= March 2016 |url=http://jetpress.org/v26.1/cerullo.pdf | quote=This is known as the information-theoretic definition of death and appears to be the ultimate definition of irreversible death.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "absolutely irreversible death" in which "destruction of the brain has occurred to such an extreme that any information it may have ever held is irrevocably lost for all eternity".&lt;ref name=Doyle/&gt;

Information-theoretic death has propagated into some mainstream [[bioethics|bioethical]], [[philosophy of biology|biophilosophical]] and [[religion|religious]] discussions of death,&lt;ref name=Doyle&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doyle DJ |title=Life, Death and Brain Death: A Critical Examination|journal=Ethics in Biology, Engineering and Medicine |volume=2 | issue=1 |pages=11–31 |date= 2011 | doi=10.1615/EthicsBiologyEngMed.2011003293 | quote=In the later case, sometimes called “absolutely irreversible death” or “information theoretic death” destruction of the brain has occurred to such an extreme that any information it may have ever held is irrevocably lost for all eternity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Whetstine L, Streat S, Darwin M, Crippen D| title = Review: Pro/con ethics debate: When is dead really dead?| journal = Critical Care| volume = 9|issue=6| pages = 538–542| date = October 2005| pmid=16356234| doi = 10.1186/cc3894| quote=This approach to defining death, which is rooted not in relative, changing technology and vitalistic worldviews, but rather in the fundamentals of physical law, is known as the information theoretic criterion of death.| pmc=1414041}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Crippen DW, Whetstine LM| title = Ethics review: Dark angels – the problem of death in intensive care| journal = Critical Care| volume = 11| issue=1 |pages = 202| date = February 2007| pmid=17254317| doi = 10.1186/cc5138| quote=Cryptographer and nanotechnologist Ralph Merkle noted, “The difference between information theoretic death and clinical death is as great as the difference between turning off a computer and dissolving that computer in acid.| pmc=2151911}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ali Afzali M |title=Brain death from the perspective of shia and modern medicine |journal=Journal of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences |volume=24 | issue=113 |pages=221–233 |date=December 2013 |url=http://jmums.mazums.ac.ir/files/site1/user_files_0d0bf0/t_mousavi-A-10-1466-109-afe925d.pdf| quote=The theory of information-theoretical death was introduced, stating that the human brain cell arrangement at one point in time loses its stored information and experiences brain death (translate.reference.com)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors= Wowk B| title= Special Section.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5896">The '''Isabella Psalter''' ([[Bavarian State Library|BSB]] Cod.gall. 16), also called the '''Psalter of Queen Isabella'''&lt;ref name=weir24&gt;Wier 24&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Psalter of Isabella of England''',&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney 274.&lt;/ref&gt; is a 14th-century [[psalter|volume containing the Book of Psalms]], named for [[Isabella of France]], who is herself depicted in it; it was likely a gift upon her betrothal or marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, "The Queen Mary Psalter" 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The illuminated manuscript is also notable for its [[bestiary]].

==Origin and history of the manuscript==
The psalter was produced ca. 1303-1308.&lt;ref&gt;Weir 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Like its "closest relation," the [[Tickhill Psalter]], it shows a French influence and is similar in content and style to the [[Queen Mary Psalter]]&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, "From Eve to Bathsheba" 184.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ormesby Psalter.&lt;ref name=egbert/&gt; Like the Queen Mary and Tickhill psalters, and like the [[Egerton Gospel]] and the Holkham Picture Bible, some of its captions and illustrations can be traced to the 12th-century ''[[Historia scholastica]]''; all these 14th-century manuscripts may have "a thirteenth-century Parisian antecedent, reflected in the Tours Genesis window" (in reference to a window in the [[clerestory]] of the [[Tours Cathedral]]).&lt;ref&gt;Papanicolaou 187.&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently held in the [[Bavarian State Library]], [[Munich]].&lt;ref name=egbert&gt;Egbert, ''The Tickhill psalter'' 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Donald Drew Egbert, the illuminators belong to the same group that illuminated the Tickhill Psalter.&lt;ref&gt;Egbert, ''A sister to the Tickhill psalter''&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Ellen Beer, however, states that while there are similarities, Egbert is too quick to identify the illuminators (whom he connects to four other manuscripts as well).&lt;ref&gt;Beer, "Gotische Buchmalerei" 165.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Beer, two of the illuminators responsible for the [[Psalter of St. Louis]] can be recognized in the Isabella Psalter.&lt;ref&gt;Beer, "Pariser Buchmalerei" 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The psalter measures {{convert|28.7|by|20.2|cm}} and consists of 131 parchment pages.&lt;ref&gt;"Psalter der Königin Isabella von England."&lt;/ref&gt; The first section is a calendar, with two illuminations per page, followed by a section with illuminations of scenes from the Old Testament and a complete bestiary, which (as in the Queen Mary Psalter) are executed as [[marginalia]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, ''The Queen Mary psalter'' 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isolation condenser''', '''isolation condensor''' ('''IC'''  or “'''iso. condenser'''” or” '''isolation condenser system'''”) is, in a [[reactor core isolation cooling system]] (“RCIC”); one of the emergency reactor safety systems in some [[nuclear plant]]s ([[boiling water reactor safety systems]]).

==Emergency passive system==
It is a passive system for cooling of some reactors (BWR/2, BWR/3 ..., and the (E)SBWR series) in nuclear production, located above containment in a pool of water open to atmosphere.

In operation, decay heat boils steam, which is drawn into the heat exchanger and condensed; then it falls by weight of gravity back into the reactor.  This process keeps the cooling water in the reactor, making it unnecessary to use powered feedwater pumps.  The water in the open pool slowly boils off, venting clean steam to the atmosphere.  This makes it unnecessary to run mechanical systems to remove heat. Periodically, the pool must be refilled, a simple task for a fire truck.  The (E)SBWR reactors provide three days' supply of water in the pool.&lt;ref name="IAEA_ESBWR"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some older reactors also have IC systems, including Fukushima Dai-ichi reactor 1, however their water pools may not be as large.

Under normal conditions, the IC system is not activated, but the top of the IC condenser is connected to the reactor's steam lines through an open valve. Steam enters the IC condenser and condenses until it is filled with water.  When the IC system is activated, a valve at the bottom of the IC condenser is opened which connects to a lower area on the reactor.  The water falls to the reactor via gravity, allowing the condenser to fill with steam, which then condenses.  This cycle runs continuously until the bottom valve is closed.&lt;ref name="UCS_FU130"&gt;{{Cite web

== Problems==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
In case of electricity failure, the valves close automatically, and operators have to open them manually, which can be difficult in case of accident has already released radioactive steam inside the building.

During the accident Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011, the operators did not open the valve manually, and emergency system had been activated too late and could not work for long. Operators did not know if they should've left the valves open or not when the tanks of two condensers were emptied of their water cooling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte.tv/fr Arte TV] (2013) : « Fukushima, chronique d'un désastre »  2013-03-07&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Joint Organisations Data Initiative''' (JODI) is an international collaboration to improve the availability and reliability of data on [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]]. First named the "Joint Oil Data Exercise", the collaboration was launched in April 2001 with six [[international organisation]]s: [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC), Statistical Office of the European Communities ([[Eurostat]]), [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA), {{ill|Latin American Energy Organization|es|Organización Latinoamericana de Energía}} (OLADE), Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ([[OPEC]]), and [[United Nations Statistics Division]] (UNSD). In 2005, the effort was renamed JODI, joined by the [[International Energy Forum]] (IEF), and covered more than 90% of the global oil market. The [[Gas Exporting Countries Forum]] (GECF) joined as an eighth partner in 2014, enabling JODI also to cover nearly 90% of the global market for natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jodidata.org/about-jodi/history.aspx |title=History of the Joint Organisations Data Initiative |work=JODI |accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemistry]], the '''linear''' [[molecular geometry]] describes the geometry around a central atom bonded to two other atoms (or ''ligands'') placed at a bond-angle of 180°. Linear organic molecules, such as acetylene (HC≡CH), are often described by invoking [[orbital hybridization#sp|sp orbital hybridization]] for their carbon centers.

According to the [[VSEPR model]], linear geometry occurs at central atoms with two bonded atoms and zero or three [[lone pair]]s (AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in the [[VSEPR theory#AXE method|AXE notation]]. Neutral AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules with linear geometry include [[beryllium fluoride]] (F−Be−F) with two [[single bond]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft2nd|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[carbon dioxide]] (O=C=O) with two [[double bond]]s, [[hydrogen cyanide]] (H−C≡N) with one single and one triple bond. The most important linear molecule with more than three atoms is [[acetylene]] (H−C≡C−H), in which each of its carbon atoms is considered to be a central atom with a single bond to one hydrogen and a triple bond to the other carbon atom. Linear anions include [[azide]] ({{chem|N|3|−}}) and [[thiocyanate]] (SCN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), and a linear cation is the [[nitronium ion]] ({{chem|NO|2|+}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greenwood|first1=N. N.|last2=Earnshaw|first2=A.|date=1997|title=Chemistry of the Elements|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|ISBN=0-7506-3365-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linear geometry also occurs in AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, such as [[xenon difluoride]] (XeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft2nd|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[triiodide]] ion ({{chem|I|3|−}}) with one iodide bonded to the two others. As described by the VSEPR model, the five valence electron pairs on the central atom form a [[Trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry|trigonal bipyramid]] in which the three lone pairs occupy the less crowded equatorial positions and the two bonded atoms occupy the two axial positions at the opposite ends of an axis, forming a linear molecule.

[[File:Guidetti cng truck.jpg|thumb|200px|Truck running with Guidetti CNG system]]
[[Image:FillingUpCNG.jpg|thumb|200px|Fueling ([[Fiat Multipla]])]]
[[Image:2009 Honda Civic NGV--DC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|2009 [[Honda Civic GX]] hooked up to Phill refueling system.]]

A '''natural gas vehicle''' ('''NGV''') is an [[alternative fuel vehicle]] that uses [[Compressed natural gas|compressed natural gas (CNG)]] or [[liquefied natural gas|liquefied natural gas (LNG)]]. Natural gas vehicles should not be confused with [[autogas|vehicles powered by LPG]] (mainly [[propane]]), which is a fuel with a fundamentally different composition.

In a natural gas powered vehicle, energy is released by combustion of essentially [[Methane]] gas (CH4) fuel with Oxygen (O2) from the air to CO2 and water vapor (H2O) in an [[internal combustion engine]]. Methane is the cleanest burning [[hydrocarbon]] and many contaminants present in [[natural gas]] are removed at source.

Safe, convenient and cost effective gas storage and fuelling is more of a challenge compared to petrol and diesel vehicles since the natural gas is pressurized and/or - in the case of LNG - the tank needs to be kept cold. This makes LNG unsuited for vehicles that are not in frequent use. The lower [[energy density]] of gases compared to liquid fuels is mitigated to a great extent by high compression or gas liquefaction, but requires a trade-off in terms of size/complexity/weight of the storage container, range of the vehicle between refueling stops, and time to refuel.

Although similar storage technologies may be used for and similar compromises would apply to a [[hydrogen vehicle]] as part of a proposed new [[hydrogen economy]], methane as a gaseous fuel is safer than hydrogen due to its [[flammability limit|lower flammability]], low corrosivity and better leak tightness due to larger [[molecular weight]]/ size, resulting in lower price hardware solutions based on proven technology and conversions. A key advantage of using natural gas is the existence, in principle, of most of the infrastructure and the supply chain, which is non-interchangeable with hydrogen. Methane today mostly comes from non-renewable sources but can be supplied or produced from [[renewable]] sources, offering net carbon neutral mobility. In many markets, especially the Americas, natural gas may trade at a discount to other [[fossil fuel]] products such as petrol, diesel or coal, or indeed be a less valuable by-product associated with their production that has to be disposed. Many countries also provide tax incentives for natural gas powered vehicles due to the environmental benefits to society. Lower operating costs and government incentives to reduce pollution from heavy vehicles in urban areas have driven the adoption of NGV for commercial and public uses, i.e. trucks and buses.

Many factors hold back NGV popularization for [[individual mobility]] applications, i.e. private vehicles, including: relatively price and environmentally insensitive but convenience seeking private individuals; good profits and taxes extractable from small batch sales of value-added, branded petrol and diesel fuels via established trade channels and oil refiners; resistance and safety concerns to increasing gas inventories in urban areas; dual-use of utility distribution networks originally built for home gas supply and allocation of network expansion costs; reluctance, effort and costs associated with switching; prestige and nostalgia associated with petroleum vehicles; fear of redundancy and disruption. A particular challenge may be the fact that refiners are currently set up to produce a certain fuels mix from crude oil. [[Aviation fuel]] is likely to remain the fuel of choice for aircraft due to their weight sensitivity for the foreseeable future.

Worldwide, there were 24.452 million NGVs by 2016, led by [[China]] (5.0 million), [[Iran]] (4.00 million), [[India]] (3.045 million), [[Pakistan]] (3.0 million), [[Argentina]] (2.295 million),  [[Brazil]] (1.781 million), and [[Italy]] (1.001 million).&lt;ref name=NGVJournal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iangv.org/current-ngv-stats/|title=Current Natural Gas Vehicle Statistics|publisher=IANGV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Asia-Pacific]] region leads the world with 6.8 million vehicles, followed by [[Latin America]] with 4.2 million.&lt;ref name=IANGV&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iangv.org/tools-resources/statistics.html |title=Natural Gas Vehicle Statistics: Summary Data 2010 |publisher=International Association for Natural Gas Vehicles |accessdate=2011-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110101111/http://www.iangv.org/tools-resources/statistics.html |archivedate=2010-01-10 |df= }} ''Click on Summary Data (2010).''&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin America, almost 90% of NGVs have [[bi-fuel engine]]s, allowing these vehicles to run on either gasoline or CNG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2011/09/26/pike-research-predicts-68-jump-in-global-cng-vehicle-sales-by-2/#continued|title=Pike Research predicts 68% jump in global CNG vehicle sales by 2016|author=Pike Research|publisher=[[AutoblogGreen]] |date=2011-09-14|accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pakistan, almost every vehicle converted to (or manufactured for) alternative fuel use typically retains the capability of running on gasoline.

As of 2016, the U.S. had a fleet of 160,000 NG vehicles, including 3,176 LNG vehicles.

Existing gasoline-powered vehicles may be converted to run on CNG or LNG, and can be dedicated (running only on natural gas) or bi-fuel (running on either gasoline or natural gas). Diesel engines for heavy trucks and busses can also be converted and can be dedicated with the addition of new heads containing spark ignition systems, or can be run on a blend of diesel and natural gas, with the primary fuel being natural gas and a small amount of diesel fuel being used as an ignition source. It is also possible to generate energy in a small gas turbine and couple the gas engine or turbine with a small electric battery to create a hybrid electric motor driven vehicle. An increasing number of vehicles worldwide are being manufactured to run on CNG by major carmakers. Until recently, the [[Honda Civic GX]] was the only NGV commercially available in the US market. More recently, [[Ford]], [[General Motors]] and [[Ram Trucks]] have bi-fuel offerings in their vehicle lineup. In 2006, the Brazilian subsidiary of [[FIAT]] introduced the [[Fiat Siena|Fiat Siena Tetra fuel]], a four-fuel car that can run on natural gas (CNG).&lt;ref name="TreeH"/&gt;

NGV filling stations can be located anywhere that natural gas lines exist. Compressors (CNG) or liquifaction plants (LNG) are usually built on large scale but with CNG small home refueling stations are possible. A company called FuelMaker pioneered such a system called Phill Home Refueling Appliance (known as "Phill"), which they developed in partnership with [[Honda]] for the American GX model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fuelmaker.com/Research/PhillQandA.htm |publisher=FuelMaker Corporation - World Leader in Convenient On-Site Refueling Systems |title=Phill: Questions and Answers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016173628/http://www.fuelmaker.com/research/phillqanda.htm |archivedate=October 16, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.evworld.com/view.cfm?section=article&amp;storyid=847 | publisher = EVWorld | title = FEATURE: Honda's Phill-way to Hydrogen | first= Bill |last = Moore | date = May 6, 2005 | work = Open Access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phill is now manufactured and sold by BRC FuelMaker, a division of Fuel Systems Solutions, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2011/03/brc-fuelmaker-again-selling-phill-home-cng-fuel-station.html|title=BRC FuelMaker Again Selling Phill Home CNG Fuel Station|accessdate=2011-04-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325155026/http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2011/03/brc-fuelmaker-again-selling-phill-home-cng-fuel-station.html|archive-date=2011-03-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNG may be generated and used for bulk storage and pipeline transport of renewable energy and also be mixed with [[biomethane]], itself derived from [[biogas]] from [[landfill]]s or [[anaerobic digestion]]. This would allow the use of CNG for mobility without increasing the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere. It would also allow continued use of CNG vehicles currently powered by non-renewable fossil fuels that do not become obsolete when stricter CO2 emissions regulations are mandated to combat global warming.

Despite its advantages, the use of natural gas vehicles faces several limitations, including fuel storage and infrastructure available for delivery and distribution at fueling stations. CNG must be stored in high pressure cylinders (3000psi to 3600psi operation pressure), and LNG must be stored in cryogenic cylinders (-260F to -200F). These cylinders take up more space than gasoline or diesel tanks that can be molded in intricate shapes to store more fuel and use less on-vehicle space. CNG tanks are usually located in the vehicle's trunk or pickup bed, reducing the space available for other cargo. This problem can be solved by installing the tanks under the body of the vehicle, or on the roof (typical for busses), leaving cargo areas free. As with other alternative fuels, other barriers for widespread use of NGVs are natural gas distribution to and at fueling stations as well as the low number of CNG and LNG stations.&lt;ref name="SusTransp"/&gt;

CNG-powered vehicles are considered to be safer than gasoline-powered vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ngvamerica.org/pdfs/TechBul2.pdf|title=How Safe are Natural Gas Vehicles?|publisher=Clean Vehicle Education Foundation|accessdate=2008-05-08|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alternativefuels.about.com/od/naturalgaspropane/a/safenaturalgas.htm|title=How Safe is Natural Gas?|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firetrainingresources.net/items/CNGAutoFire-FIREFIGHTERNEARMISScompressedpics.pdf|title=Fighting CNG fires|accessdate=2008-05-08|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528041023/http://www.firetrainingresources.net/items/CNGAutoFire-FIREFIGHTERNEARMISScompressedpics.pdf|archivedate=2008-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences between LNG and CNG fuels===
Though LNG and CNG are both considered NGVs, the technologies are vastly different.  Refueling equipment, fuel cost, pumps, tanks, hazards, capital costs are all different.

One thing they share is that due to engines made for gasoline, computer controlled valves to control fuel mixtures are required for both of them, often being proprietary and specific to the manufacturer. The on-engine technology for fuel metering is the same for LNG and CNG.

===CNG as an auto fuel===
CNG, or compressed natural gas, is stored at high pressure, {{Convert|3000|to|3600|psi|MPa}}. The required tank is more massive and costly than a conventional fuel tank. Commercial on-demand refueling stations are more expensive to operate than LNG stations because of the energy required for compression, the compressor requires 100 times more electrical power, however, slow-fill (many hours) can be cost-effective with LNG stations [missing citation - the initial liquefaction of natural gas by cooling requires more energy than gas compression]. Time to fill a CNG tank varies greatly depending on the station. Home refuelers typically fill at about 0.4 [[Gasoline gallon equivalent|GGE]]/hr. "Fast-fill" stations may be able to refill a 10 GGE tank in 5–10 minutes. Also, because of the lower energy density, the range on CNG is limited by comparison to LNG. Gas composition and throughput allowing, it should be feasible to connect commercial CNG fueling stations to city gas networks, or enable home fueling of CNG vehicles directly using a gas compressor. Similar to a car battery, the CNG tank of a car could double as a home energy storage device and the compressor could be powered at times when there is excess/ free renewable electrical energy.

===LNG as an auto fuel===
LNG, or liquified natural gas, is natural gas that has been cooled to a point that it is a cryogenic liquid. In its liquid state, it is still more than 2 times as dense as CNG. LNG is usually dispensed from bulk storage tanks at LNG fuel stations at rates exceeding 20 [[Diesel gallon equivalent|DGE]]/min. Sometimes LNG is made locally from utility pipe. Because of its cryogenic nature, it is stored in specially designed insulated tanks. Generally speaking, these tanks operate at fairly low pressures (about 70-150 psi) when compared to CNG. A vaporizer is mounted in the fuel system that turns the LNG into a gas (which may simply be considered low pressure CNG). When comparing building a commercial LNG station with a CNG station, utility infrastructure, capital cost, and electricity heavily favor LNG over CNG. There are existing LCNG stations (both CNG and LNG), where fuel is stored as LNG, then vaporized to CNG on-demand. LCNG stations require less capital cost than fast-fill CNG stations alone, but more than LNG stations.

===Advantages over gasoline and diesel===
LNG – and especially CNG – tends to corrode and wear the parts of an engine less rapidly than gasoline. Thus it is quite common to find diesel-engine NGVs with high mileages (over 500,000 miles). CNG also emits 20-29% less CO2 than diesel and gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gas-south.com/business/compressed-natural-gas.aspx|title=Gas South Compressed Natural Gas|website=www.gas-south.com|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emissions are cleaner, with lower emissions of carbon and lower particulate emissions per equivalent distance traveled. There is generally less wasted fuel. However, cost (monetary, environmental, pre-existing infrastructure) of distribution, compression, cooling must be taken into account.

===Inherent advantages/disadvantages between autogas (LPG) power and NGV===
[[Autogas]], also known as LPG, has different chemical composition, but still a petroleum based gas, has a number of inherent advantages and disadvantages, as well as noninherent ones. The inherent advantage of autogas over CNG is that it requires far less compression (20% of CNG cost),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energ2.com/home/applications/adsorbed-natural-gas.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010015546/http://www.energ2.com/home/applications/adsorbed-natural-gas.html |archivedate=2013-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is denser as it is a liquid at room temperature, and thus requires far cheaper tanks (consumer) and fuel compressors (provider) than CNG. As compared to LNG, it requires no chilling (and thus less energy), or problems associated with extreme cold such as [[frostbite]]. Like NGV, it also has advantages over gasoline and diesel in cleaner emissions, along with less wear on engines over gasoline. The major drawback of LPG is its safety. The fuel is volatile and the fumes are heavier than air, which causes them to collect in a low spot in the event of a leak, making it far more hazardous to use and more care is needed in handling. Besides this, LPG (40% from Crude Oil refining) is more expensive than Natural Gas.

====Current advantages of LPG power over NGV====
In places like the US, Thailand, and India, there are five to ten times more stations thus making the fuel more accessible than NGV stations. Other countries like Poland, South Korea, and Turkey, LPG stations and autos are widespread while NGVs are not. In addition, in some countries such as Thailand, the retail LPG fuel is considerably cheaper in cost.

===Future possibilities===
Though ANG (adsorbed natural gas) has not yet been used in either providing stations nor consumer storage tanks, its low compression (500psi vs 3600 psi)&lt;ref&gt;http://web.anl.gov/PCS/acsfuel/preprint%20archive/Files/41_1_NEW%20ORLEANS_03-96_0246.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; has the potential to drive down costs of NGV infrastructure and vehicle tanks.

===Use of LNG to fuel high-horsepower/high-torque engines===

In internal combustion engines the volume of the cylinders is a common measure of the power of an engine. Thus a 2000cc engine would typically be more powerful than an 1800cc engine, but that assumes a similar air-fuel mixture is used.

If, via a turbocharger as an example, the 1800cc engine were using an air-fuel mixture that was significantly more energy dense, then it might be able to produce more power than a 2000cc engine burning a less energy dense air-fuel mixture. However, turbochargers are both complex and expensive. Thus it becomes clear for high-horsepower/high-torque engines a fuel that can inherently be used to create a more energy dense air-fuel mixture is preferred because a smaller and simpler engine can be used to produce the same power.

With traditional gasoline and diesel engines the energy density of the air-fuel mixture is limited because the liquid fuels do not mix well in the cylinder. Further, gasoline and diesel auto-ignite&lt;ref&gt;[[Autoignition temperature]]&lt;/ref&gt; at temperatures and pressures relevant to engine design. An important part of traditional engine design is designing the cylinders, compression ratios, and fuel injectors such that pre-ignition is avoided,&lt;ref&gt;[[Engine knocking#Pre-ignition]]&lt;/ref&gt; but at the same time as much fuel as possible can be injected, become well mixed, and still have time to complete the combustion process during the power stroke.

Natural gas does not auto-ignite at pressures and temperatures relevant to traditional gasoline and diesel engine design, thus providing more flexibility in the design of a natural gas engine. Methane, the main component of natural gas, has an autoignition temperature of 580C/1076F,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/fuels-ignition-temperatures-d_171.html| title=Fuels and Chemicals - Autoignition Temperatures| accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas gasoline and diesel autoignite at approximately 250C and 210C respectively.

With a compressed natural gas (CNG) engine, the mixing of the fuel and the air is more effective since gases typically mix well in a short period of time, but at typical CNG compression pressures the fuel itself is less energy dense than gasoline or diesel thus the end result is a lower energy dense air-fuel mixture. Thus for the same cylinder displacement engine, a non turbocharged CNG powered engine is typically less powerful than a similarly sized gasoline or diesel engine. For that reason, turbochargers are popular on European CNG cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://wardsauto.com/ar/turbocharing_cng_europe_100308| title=Turbocharging Boosting Demand for CNG Vehicles in Europe| accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that limitation, the 12 liter Cummins Westport ISX12G engine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cumminswestport.com/models/isx12-g| title=Cummins Westport ISX12 G natural gas engine| accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of a CNG capable engine designed to pull tractor/trailer loads up to 80,000 lbs showing CNG can be used in most if not all on-road truck applications. The original ISX G engines incorporated a turbocharger to enhance the air-fuel energy density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/pdfs/36252.pdf| title=Development of the High-Pressure Direct-Injection ISX G Natural Gas Engine| accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LNG offers a unique advantage over CNG for more demanding high-horsepower applications by eliminating the need for a turbocharger. Because LNG boils at approximately -160C, using a simple heat exchanger a small amount of LNG can be converted to its gaseous form at extremely high pressure with the use of little or no mechanical energy. A properly designed high-horsepower engine can leverage this extremely high pressure energy dense gaseous fuel source to create a higher energy density air-fuel mixture than can be efficiently created with a CNG powered engine. The end result when compared to CNG engines is more overall efficiency in high-horsepower engine applications when high-pressure direct injection technology is used. The Westport HDMI2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.westport.com/is/core-technologies/hpdi-2| title=WESTPORT HPDI 2.0  LNG engine| accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; fuel system is an example of a high-pressure direct injection technology that does not require a turbocharger if teamed with appropriate LNG heat exchanger technology. The Volvo Trucks 13-liter LNG engine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lngworldnews.com/volvo-trucks-north-america-to-launch-lng-engine/| title=Volvo Trucks North America to Launch LNG Engine| accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is another example of a LNG engine leveraging advanced high pressure technology.

Westport recommends CNG for engines 7 liters or smaller and LNG with direct injection for engines between 20 and 150 liters. For engines between 7 and 20 liters either option is recommended. See slide 13 from their NGV BRUXELLES – INDUSTRY INNOVATION SESSION presentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ngvaeurope.eu/downloads/NGV_2014_BRUSSELS/1._Roberto_Defilippi.pdf| title=An innovative vision for LNG Fuel System for MD Diesel Dual Fuel Engine(DDF+LNG)| accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High horsepower engines in the oil drilling, mining, locomotive, and marine fields have been or are being developed. Paul Blomerous has written a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gastechnology.org/Training/Documents/LNG17-proceedings/7-4-Paul_Blomerus.pdf| title=LNG AS A FUEL FOR DEMANDING HIGH HORSEPOWER ENGINE APPLICATIONS: TECHNOLOGY AND APPROACHES| accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluding as much as 40 million tonnes per annum of LNG (approximately 26.1 billion gallons/year or 71 million gallons/day) could be required just to meet the global needs of the high-horsepower engines by 2025 to 2030.

As of the end of 1st quarter 2015 Prometheus Energy Group Inc claims to have delivered over 100 million gallons of LNG within the previous 4 years into the industrial market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lngglobal.com/latest/prometheus-agreement-with-wpx-energy-to-supply-lng-and-equipment-for-drilling-operations.html| title=Prometheus agreement with WPX Energy to supply LNG and equipment for drilling operations| accessdate=17 April 2015| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926033722/http://www.lngglobal.com/latest/prometheus-agreement-with-wpx-energy-to-supply-lng-and-equipment-for-drilling-operations.html| archivedate=26 September 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is continuing to add new customers.

===Ships===
The {{MV|Isla Bella}} is the world's first [[LNG]] powered [[container ship]].&lt;ref name=Schuler&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schuler|first1=Mike|title=Introducing ISLA BELLA – World’s First LNG-Powered Containership Launched at NASSCO|publisher=gCaptain|date=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; LNG carriers are sometimes powered by the boil-off of LNG from their storage tanks, although Diesel powered LNG carriers are also common to minimize loss of cargo and enable more versatile refueling.

===Aircraft===
[[Aviation fuel#LNG|Some airplanes]] use LNG to power their turbofans. Aircraft are particularly sensitive to weight and much of the weight of an aircraft goes into fuel carriage to allow the range. The low energy density of natural gas even in liquid form compared to conventional fuels give it a distinct disadvantage for flight applications.

== Chemical composition and energy content ==

=== Chemical composition ===

The primary component of [[natural gas]] is [[methane]] ([[carbon|C]][[hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), the shortest and lightest [[hydrocarbon]] molecule. It may also contain heavier gaseous hydrocarbons such as [[ethane]] ([[carbon|C]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), [[propane]] ([[carbon|C]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[[hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[butane]] ([[carbon|C]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[[hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), as well as other gases, in varying amounts. [[Hydrogen sulfide]] ([[hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[sulfur|S]]) is a common contaminant, which must be removed prior to most uses.

===Energy content===

[[Combustion]] of one cubic meter yields 38 MJ (10.6 kWh). Natural gas has the highest energy/carbon ratio of any fossil fuel, and thus produces less carbon dioxide per unit of energy.

== Storage and transport ==

===Transport===

The major difficulty in the use of natural gas is [[transport]]ation. Natural gas [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] are economical and common on land and across medium-length stretches of water (like [[Langeled pipeline|Langeled]], [[Interconnector (North Sea)|Interconnector]] and [[Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline]]), but are impractical across large oceans. Liquefied natural gas ([[LNG]]) [[LNG carrier|tanker ships]], railway tankers, and [[tank truck]]s are also used.

===Storage===
[[File:Storage Density of Natural Gas.jpg|thumb|storage density of natural gas]]
CNG is typically stored in steel or [[composite overwrapped pressure vessel|composite containers]] at high pressure (3000 to 4000 psi, or 205 to 275 bar). These containers are not typically temperature controlled, but are allowed to stay at local ambient temperature. There are many standards for CNG cylinders, the most popular one is ISO 11439.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=33298 | title = ISO 11439:2000, Gas cylinders -- High pressure cylinders for the on-board storage of natural gas as a fuel for automotive vehicles |publisher = ISO ([[International Organization for Standardization]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso11439.com |title=ISO 11439 Overview and FAQ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713063142/http://www.iso11439.com/ |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For North America the standard is ANSI NGV-2.

LNG storage pressures are typically around 50-150 psi, or 3 to 10 bar. At atmospheric pressure, LNG is at a temperature of -260&amp;nbsp;°F (-162&amp;nbsp;°C), however, in a vehicle tank under pressure the temperature is slightly higher (see [[saturated fluid]]). Storage temperatures may vary due to varying composition and storage pressure. LNG is far denser than even the highly compressed state of CNG. As a consequence of the low temperatures, vacuum insulated storage tanks typically made of stainless steel are used to hold LNG.

CNG can be stored at lower pressure in a form known as an ANG ([[Adsorbed]] Natural Gas) tank at 35 bar (500 psi, the pressure of gas in natural gas pipelines) in various sponge like materials, such as [[activated carbon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | date = February 16, 2007 | title = From Farm Waste to Fuel Tanks |url = https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=108390 |publisher = US [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[metal-organic framework]]s (MOFs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ja0771639 | publisher = US [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | title = Metal-Organic Framework from an Anthracene Derivative Containing Nanoscopic Cages Exhibiting High Methane Uptake | author=Shengqian Ma |author2=Daofeng Sun |author3=Jason M.

This means that vehicles can be refuelled from the natural gas network without extra gas compression, the fuel tanks can be slimmed down and made of lighter, less strong materials.

=== Conversion kits ===
Conversion kits for gasoline or diesel to LNG/CNG are available in many countries, along with the labor to install them. However, the range of prices and quality of conversion vary enormously.

Recently, regulations involving certification of installations in USA have been loosened to include certified private companies, those same kit installations for CNG have fallen to the $6,000+ range (depending on type of vehicle).{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Overview===

Natural gas vehicles are popular in regions or countries where natural gas is abundant and where the government chooses to price CNG lower than gasoline.&lt;ref name="TwoBillion"/&gt; The use of natural gas began in the [[Po Valley|Po River Valley]] of [[Italy]] in the 1930s, followed by [[New Zealand]] in the 1980s, though its use has declined there. At the peak of New Zealand's natural gas use, 10% of the nation's cars were converted, around 110,000 vehicles.&lt;ref name="TwoBillion"/&gt; In the United States CNG powered buses are the favorite choice of several [[public transit]] agencies, with a fleet of more than 114,000 vehicles, mostly buses.&lt;ref name="GreenCar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/10/forecast-17m-natural-gas-vehicles-worldwide-by-2015.html#more|title=Forecast: 17M Natural Gas Vehicles Worldwide by 2015|author=Pike Research|date=2009-10-19|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; India, Australia, Argentina, and Germany also have widespread use of natural gas-powered buses in their public transportation fleets.&lt;ref name="TwoBillion"/&gt;

===Europe===

[[File:CNG-powered buses in Horlivka, Ukraine.tif|thumb|CNG-powered buses in [[Horlivka]], eastern  Ukraine ]]

====Germany====
Germany hit the milestone of 900 CNG filling stations nationwide in December 2011. Gibgas, an independent consumer group, estimates that 21% of all CNG filling stations in the country offer a natural gas/[[biomethane]] mix to varying ratios, and 38 stations offer pure biomethane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngvglobal.com/900th-cng-filling-station-for-germany-1221|title=900th CNG Filling Station for Germany|author=Gibgas|publisher=NGV Global News|date=2011-12-21|accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Greece ====
[[Greece]] uses natural gas buses for public transport in [[Athens]].
Also the Public Gas Company (DEPA) has a network of 11 stations (as of 2017), under brand "Fisikon", and plans more stations in next 5 years.

====Ireland====
[[Bus Éireann]] Introduced the first [[NGV]] on 17 July 2012. It will operate on the 216 city centre to Mount Oval, Rochestown, route until mid-August on a trial being undertaken in partnership with [[Ervia]]. The Eco-city bus is made by [[MAN SE|MAN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2012/0717/ireland/natural-gas-bus-hits-the-streets-in-bid-to-cut-fuel-bill-201037.html| title = Natural gas bus hits the streets in bid to cut fuel bill | first = Eoin |last = English | date = July 17, 2012 | newspaper = Irish Examiner }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
Natural gas traction is quite popular in Italy, due to the existence of a capillar distribution network for industrial use since the late 50s and a traditionally high retail price for petrol. As of April 2012 there were about 1173 filling stations, mainly located in the northern regions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metanoauto.com/modules.php?name=Distributori | title = Distributori metano in Europa: Il primo elenco interattivo aggiornato in tempo reale, online da maggio 2006 |trans-title=Natural gas distributors in Europe: The first list is updated in real-time interactive, online since May 2006| publisher =  metanoauto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the fleet reached 730,000 CNG vehicles at the end of 2010.&lt;ref name=IANGV/&gt;

====Ukraine====
Ukraine's first compressed natural gas refueling station (CNGS) was commissioned in 1937. Today, there is a well-developed CNGS network across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.apvgn.pt/documentacao/gnc_ucrania.pdf | title = Use of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) as Motor Fuel in Ukraine, Prospects and Problems | date = 2006 | publisher = 23rd World Gas Conference, Amsterdam | authors = Igor Orlov and Volodymyr Kozak | access-date = 2014-01-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040300/http://www.apvgn.pt/documentacao/gnc_ucrania.pdf | archive-date = 2014-01-06 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many buses were converted to run on CNG during the 1990s, primarily for economic reasons. The retrofitted cylinders are often visible atop the vehicle's roof and/or underneath the body. Despite their age, these buses remain in service and continue to provide reliable public transport combined with the environmental benefits of CNG.

====United Kingdom====
CNG buses are beginning to be used in the UK, e.g. by [[Reading Buses]].

===North America===

With the recent increase in natural gas production due to widespread use of [[fracking]] technology, many countries, including the United States and Canada, now can be self-sufficient. Canada is a substantial net exporter of natural gas, though the United States still has a net import of natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=ca#ng|title=International - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n9180us1m.htm|title=U.S. Natural Gas Net Imports  (Billion Cubic Feet)|website=www.eia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural gas prices have decreased dramatically in the past few years and are likely to decrease further as additional production comes on line. However, the EIA predicts that natural gas prices will start increasing in a few years as the most profitable natural gas reserves are used up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www2.hmc.edu/~evans/AEO2012.pdf | title = Annual Energy Outlook 2012 | date = June 2012 | page = 91 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural gas prices have decreased from $13 per mmbtu (USD) in 2008 to $3 per mmbtu (USD) in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.infomine.com/investment/metal-prices/natural-gas/all/ | title = Historical Natural Gas Prices and Price Chart | publisher =  InfoMine Inc. | accessdate = 24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely therefore that natural gas-powered vehicles will be increasingly cheaper to run relative to gasoline-powered vehicles. The issue is how to finance the purchase and installation of conversion kits. Some support may be available through the Department of Energy. Private initiatives which essentially lease the conversion equipment in exchange for slightly higher natural gas refueling can be self-financing and offer considerable advantages to liquidity strapped consumers.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

====Canada====

As of 12-Dec-2013 Waste Management has a fleet of 2000 CNG Collection trucks; as of 12-Dec-2013 UPS has 2700 alternative fuel vehicles. As of February 2011, there were 873 CNG refueling sites, 2,589 LPG sites, and 40 LNG sites, led by [[California]] with 215 CNG refueling stations in operation, 228 LPG sites and 32 LNG sites. The number of refueling stations includes both public and private sites, and not all are available to the public.&lt;ref name=USeDataBook/&gt; As of December 2010, the U.S. ranked 6th in the world in terms of number of NGV stations.&lt;ref name=IANGV/&gt; Currently there are 160,000 NGVs operating in the country.

====Mexico====
The natural gas vehicle market is limited to fleet vehicles and other public use vehicles like minibuses in larger cities. However the state-owned bus company [[Red de Transporte de Pasajeros|RTP]] Of [[Mexico City]] has purchased 30 [[Hyundai]] Super Aero City CNG-Propelled buses to integrate with the existing fleet as well as to introduce new routes within the city.

===South America===

====Overview====
CNG vehicles are common in South America, with a 35% share of the worldwide NGV fleet,&lt;ref name=IANGV/&gt; where these vehicles are mainly used as [[taxicab]]s in main cities of Argentina and Brazil. Normally, standard gasoline vehicles are retrofitted in specialized shops, which involve installing the gas cylinder in the trunk and the CNG injection system and electronics.

As of 2009 Argentina had 1,807,186 NGV's with 1,851 refueling stations across the nation,&lt;ref name=IANGV/&gt; or 15% of all vehicles;&lt;ref name="LatinGNV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngvglobal.com/en/country-reports/latin-america-ngvs-an-update-report-02074.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20081120221031/http://www.ngvglobal.com/en/country-reports/latin-america-ngvs-an-update-report-02074.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-11-20 |title=Latin America NGVs: An Update Report |author=R.

Colombia had an NGV fleet of 300,000 vehicles, and 460 refueling stations as of 2009.&lt;ref name=IANGV/&gt; [[Bolivia]] has increased its fleet from 10,000 in 2003 to 121,908 units in 2009, with 128 refueling stations.&lt;ref name=IANGV/&gt;

Peru had 81,024 NGVs and 94 fueling stations as 2009,.&lt;ref name=IANGV/&gt; In Peru, several factory-built CNVs have the tanks installed under the body of the vehicle, leaving the trunk free. Among the models built with this feature are the [[Fiat Multipla]], the new [[Fiat Panda]], the [[Volkswagen Touran]] Ecofuel, the [[Volkswagen Caddy]] Ecofuel, and the Chevy Taxi. Right now, Peru has 224,035 NGVs.

Other countries with significant NGV fleets are [[Venezuela]] (226,100) as of 2017 and [[Chile]] (15,000) as of 2017.&lt;ref name=IANGV/&gt;

[[GM do Brasil]] introduced the MultiPower engine in August 2004 which was capable of using CNG, alcohol and gasoline as fuel. The GM engine has electronic fuel injection that automatically adjusts to any acceptable fuel configuration. This motor was used in the [[Opel Astra|Chevrolet Astra]] and was aimed at the taxi market.&lt;ref name="GNVNews"/&gt;

Since 2003 and with the commercial success of flex cars in Brazil, another existing option is to [[retrofit]] an ethanol [[flexible-fuel vehicle]] to add a natural gas tank and the corresponding injection system. Some [[taxicab]]s in [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, run on this option, allowing the user to choose among three fuels (E25, E100 and CNG) according to current market prices at the pump. Vehicles with this adaptation are known in Brazil as '''tri-fuel''' cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.devanagari.com.br/taxinews.com.br/pag/noticia_02_resumos.asp?regn=36|title=Gás Natural Veicular|publisher=TDenavagari.com.br|author=TaxiNews|date=|accessdate=2008-08-24|language=Portuguese}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CNG filling station, Delhi.JPG|thumb|A CNG powered car being filled in a filling station in Delhi]]
In 1993, CNG had become available in [[Delhi]], India's capital, though LPG is what really took off due to its inherently far lower capital costs. Compressed Natural Gas is a domestic energy produced in Western parts of India. In India, most CNG vehicles are dual fueled, which means they can run both on CNG and gasoline. This makes it very convenient and users can drive long distances without worrying about availability of natural gas (as long as gasoline is available). As of December 2010 India had 1,080,000 NGVs and 560 fueling stations, many of the older ones being LPG rather than CNG.&lt;ref name=IANGV/&gt; In addition, it is thought that more illegally converted LPG autos than legal ones ply the streets in India, some estimates are as high as 15 million "autos" (running the gamut of everything from LPG motored pedal bicycles to CNG buses)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://info.bellperformance.com/blog/bid/48368/LPG-Fueled-Vehicles-Coming-Soon | work = Blog | title = LPG Fueled Vehicles Coming Soon |publisher = Bell Performance, Inc. |date = 22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, a lawyer filed a case with the [[Supreme Court of India]] under the Public Interest Litigation rule, which is part of the Constitution of India and enables any citizen to address directly the Supreme Court. The lawyer's case was about the health risks caused by air pollution emitted from road vehicles. The Supreme Court decided that cars put into circulation after 1995 would have to run on unleaded fuel. By 1998, India was converted to 100% of unleaded fuel after the government ruled that diesel cars in India were restricted to 10,000 ppm after 1995. At the beginning of 2005, 10,300 CNG busses, 55,000 CNG three-wheelers taxis, 5,000 CNG minibuses, 10,000 CNG taxis and 10,000 CNG cars run on India's roads (1982-2008 Product-Life Institute, Geneva). The Delhi Transport Corporation currently operates the world's largest fleet of CNG buses for public transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.product-life.org/en/archive/cng-delhi | title = CNG Delhi – the world’s cleanest public bus system running on CNG: Interview with Anumita Roychaudhary, CES | publisher = Product-Life Institute, Geneva | date = |accessdate = 25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently India stands 3rd with 3.045 million NGVs.

====Iran====
By the end of 2015, Iran had the world's largest fleet of NGV at 3.5 million vehicles. The share of compressed natural gas in the national fuel basket is more than 23%. CNG consumption by Iran's transportation sector is around 20 million cubic meters per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://financialtribune.com/articles/economy-auto/32408/iran-gas-vehicle-market-projections|title=Iran Gas Vehicle Market Projections|date=19 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 2,335 CNG stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://financialtribune.com/articles/energy/44382/cng-stations-top-2380-march|title=CNG Stations to Top 2,380 by March|date=25 June 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of NGV market in Iran has in large part been due to Iranian government intervention to decrease the society's dependence on gasoline.

[[Image:No.39.jpg|thumb|A CNG powered [[Hino Motors|Hino RU1JSSL]] bus, operated by [[Bangkok Mass Transit Authority|BMTA]] in [[Thailand]].]]

====Thailand====
[[Thailand]] has for over a 15 years run [[autogas]] taxi cabs in Bangkok,&lt;ref name="Thailand08"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ngvglobal.com/ptt-softens-loans-for-truck-operators-over-30-million-available-0819 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025032527/http://www.ngvglobal.com/ptt-softens-loans-for-truck-operators-over-30-million-available-0819 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 25, 2012 |title=PTT Softens Loans for Truck Operators – Over $30 Million Available |date=August 19, 2008 |location=Thailand, Bangkok |publisher=NGV Global News }}&lt;/ref&gt; though autos and buses had erroneously labelled NGV stickers on them, when in fact, were LPG fuelled.

In view of a generous supply of natural gas but relying on imported oil, the Thailand government heavily promoted alternative fuels like LPG, natural gas and ethanol to replace gasoline beginning around 2003, yet NGV was very slow to take off due to cheaper LPG fuel, a pre-existing LPG fleet, and very low conversion cost of local LPG conversion shops as compared to factory installed CNG or conversion. A significant effort was taken when the state-controlled oil company [[PTT Public Company Limited|PTT PCL]] built a network of natural gas refueling stations. The cost of subsidy was estimated at US$150 million in 2008.

As price of oil climbed rapidly, it was estimated more than 40,000 new cars and trucks powered by natural-gas were purchased in six months in 2008, including many buses. That year, about half of the taxi fleet in Bangkok used LPG, and were prodded to convert to CNG, with little success. Since 2008, there has been a government arm-twisting to switch from LPG to CNG, with a rollout of CNG stations near Bangkok around 2007 and then upcountry in 2010, at times replacing LPG stations. Operators of used vehicles have balked at the massive conversion cost (up to quadruple that of LPG in Thailand), especially given Thailand's strong ultra-competitive domestic LPG conversion industry, as well as retail CNG fuel cost (one and a half times). Thailand had some 700,000 LPG fueled vehicles, and 300,000 CNG fueled, with 1,000 LPG stations and 600 CNG as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.bangkokpost.com/business/economics/317341/motorists-unfazed-by-dearer-gas | newspaper = Bangkok Post | title = Motorists unfazed by dearer gas | date = 2012-10-17 | first = Yuthana |last = Praiwan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demand has increased 26% over 2011 for CNG in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/business/economics/324746/cng-price-likely-to-be-at-b13-28|title=CNG price likely to be at B13.28|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|last=Limited|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the end of 2012, Thailand has 1,014,000 LPG fueled vehicles, and consumed 606,000 tonnes in 2012 of LPG, while 483 stations serve up some 380,000 CNG vehicles.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/337380/lpg-vechicles-exceed-1-million|title=LPG vehicles exceed 1 million|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|last=Limited|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that LPG conversion continues to enjoy heavy favor over NGVs despite massive government push for CNG. CNG vehicles are more likely to be bought factory installed while LPG is likely to be an aftermarket conversion. LNG vehicles in Thailand are almost non-existent except for lorries.

====Malaysia====
In [[Malaysia]], the use of [[compressed natural gas]] was originally introduced for taxicabs and airport limousines during the late-1990s, when new taxis were launched with NGV engines while taxicab operators were encouraged to send in existing taxis for full engine conversions, reducing their costs of operation. Any vehicle converted to use CNG is labelled with white rhombus "NGV" (Natural Gas Vehicle) tags, lending to the common use of "NGV" when referring to road vehicles with CNG engine. The practice of using CNG remained largely confined to taxicabs predominantly in the [[Klang Valley]] and [[Penang]] due to a lack of interest. No incentives were offered for those besides taxicab owners to use CNG engines, while government subsidies on petrol and diesel made conventional road vehicles cheaper to use in the eyes of the consumers. [[Petronas]], Malaysia's state-owned oil company, also monopolises the provision of CNG to road users. {{As of|2008|July|df=US}}, Petronas only operates about 150 CNG refueling stations, most of which are concentrated in the Klang Valley. At the same time, another 50 was expected by the end of 2008.&lt;ref name="MY CNG station no"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/metro/story.asp?file=/2008/6/13/central/21532536 |title=More natural gas stations needed, say motorists |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|''The Star'' Online]] |date=2008-06-13 |accessdate=2008-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521140522/http://thestar.com.my/metro/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F6%2F13%2Fcentral%2F21532536 |archivedate=2011-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNG is almost unheard of as a transport fuel before 2010 in the archipelago except in [[Jakarta]], where a very relatively minor number of vehicles, most notably [[Transjakarta]] buses, use the fuel. However, since 2010 there has been a government emphasis to push usage of CNG not only for vehicle fuel, but also for domestic consumption over wood burning (which can produce deadly methanol) and kerosene.

In 2012, the team, led by [[Nicola Ventura]], competes with a Fiat 500 Abarth,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alvolante.it/news/abarth_500_metano-664611044 Fiat 500 Abarth]&lt;/ref&gt; modified to run on natural gas with a Cavagna/Bigas fuel conversion kit and thus renamed "500 EcoAbarth". The driver is [[Massimo Liverani]] while in the role of navigator, alternate Valeria Strada, Alessandro Talmelli and [[Fulvio Ciervo]]. On October 14, 2012, at the end of the 7th Ecorally San Marino-Vatican with 3 wins and a second place (out of 4 races),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecorally.eu/ Ecorally San Marino-Vatican]&lt;/ref&gt; the Team also won the Italian CSAI Alternative Energy Pilots and Navigators titles. On 28 October 2012, after having raced in 7 European countries, collecting 3 wins, 2 second places and additional points, the team won the FIA Alternative Energies Drivers and Constructors world titles. For the first time ever, a car powered by methane won an FIA world title. In 2013, the team raced in the [[FIA Alternative Energies Cup]] and [[:it:Campionato Italiano CSAI Energie Alternative|CSAI]] Championships. The "500 EcoAbarth" of Ecomotori.net dominated the season, winning 5 of 5 titles. Thanks to the work of the team, the Abarth once again won a constructors' title since its last win 46 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpgasmagazine.com/cavagna-bigas-traveling-to-world-lp-gas-forum-in-style/ Abarth]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Penrose criterion''' in [[Plasma Physics]] is a criterion for kinetic [[Stability theory|stability]] of a plasma with a given [[velocity]]-[[space]] distribution function. This criterion can be used to determine that all so-called "single-humped" distributions (those with a single [[maximum]]), are kinetically stable.

A 2013 study published in the journal ''Energy Policy'' explored the relative benefits of a vehicle-charging network and plug-in hybrid vehicles with larger batteries. Across the battery-capacity and charging-infrastructure scenarios examined, the lowest-cost solution is for more drivers to switch to traditional hybrid electrics or low-capacity plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Installing charging infrastructure would provide lower gasoline savings per dollar spent than paying for increased PHEV battery capacity. In addition, the study determined that current federal subsidies are "not aligned with the goal of decreased gasoline consumption in a consistent and efficient manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/sustainability/cost-effectiveness-plug-in-hybrids-charging-infrastructure |title=Cost-effectiveness of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Battery Capacity and Charging Infrastructure Investment for Reducing U.S. Gasoline Consumption |author=Leighton W.

=====Federal incentives=====

First the [[Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008]], and later the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009]] (ACES) granted [[tax credit]]s for new qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles.&lt;ref name=IRS2009/&gt; The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] (ARRA) also authorized federal tax credits for converted plug-ins, though the credit is lower than for new plug-in electric vehicle (PEV).&lt;ref name=IRS0409/&gt;

As defined by the 2009 ACES Act, a PEV is a vehicle which draws propulsion energy from a traction battery with at least 5 [[kwh]] of capacity and uses an offboard source of energy to recharge such battery.&lt;ref name="IRS2009"/&gt; The tax credit for new plug-in electric vehicles is worth {{USD|2,500}} plus {{USD|417}} for each kilowatt-hour of battery capacity over 5 kwh, and the portion of the credit determined by battery capacity cannot exceed {{USD|5,000}}. Therefore, the total amount of the credit, between {{USD|2,500}} and {{USD|7,500}}, will vary depending on the capacity of the battery (4 to 16 kWh) used to power the vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kontou|first1=Eleftheria|last2=Yin|first2=Yafeng|last3=Lin|first3=Zhenhong|last4=He|first4=Fang|title=Socially optimal replacement of conventional with electric vehicles for the US household fleet|journal=International Journal of Sustainable Transportation|date=5 April 2017|volume=11|issue=10|pages=749–763|doi=10.1080/15568318.2017.1313341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The qualified plug-in electric vehicle credit phases out for a plug-in manufacturer over the one-year period beginning with the second calendar quarter after the calendar quarter in which at least 200,000 qualifying plug-in vehicles from that manufacturer have been sold for use in the U.S. Cumulative sales started counting sales after December 31, 2009.

A 2016 study conducted by researchers from the [[University of California, Davis]] found that the federal tax credit was the reason behind more than 30% of the plug-in electric sales. The impact of the federal tax incentive is higher among owners of the [[Nissan Leaf]], with up to 49% of sales attributable to the federal incentive. The study, based on an stated preference survey of more than 2,882 plug in vehicle owners in 11 states, also found that the federal tax credit shifts buyers from [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles to plug-in vehicles and advances the purchase timing of new vehicles by a year or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exploring the Impact of the Federal Tax Credit on the Plug-In Vehicle Market |author1=Tal, Gil |author2=Michael A.

=====New proposals=====
[[File:Cadillac ELR 2013 NY Auto Show.jpg|thumb|A 2014 proposal to increase the maximum tax credit for plug-in electric vehicles to {{USD|10,000}} would not apply to luxury vehicles with a sales price of over {{USD|45,000}}, such as the [[Cadillac ELR]] (shown) and the [[Tesla Model S]].]]

Several separate initiatives have been pursued unsuccessfully at the federal level since 2011 to transform the tax credit into an instant cash rebate. The objective of these initiatives is to make new qualifying [[plug-in electric car]]s more accessible to buyers by making the incentive more effective. The rebate would be available at the point of sale allowing consumers to avoid a wait of up to a year to apply the tax credit against income tax returns.&lt;ref name=Rebate1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarreports.com/blog/1055032_senator-stabenow-7500-electric-car-credit-should-be-rebate |title=Senator Stabenow: $7,500 Electric-Car Credit Should Be Rebate |author=John Voelcker |publisher=GreenCarReports.com |date=2011-02-08 |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rebate2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/02/budget-20110214.html#tp |title=Obama FY 2012 budget proposes big boost for EVs and EV technology, cuts for hydrogen |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2011-02-14 |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plugincars.com/white-house-pushes-instant-7500-cash-rebate-towards-electric-car-purchases-106794.html |title=White House Pushes For a $7,500 Instant Cash Rebate Towards Electric Car Purchases |publisher=PluginCars.com |author=Nick Chambers |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the [[Obama Administration]] included a provision in the FY 2015 Budget to increase the maximum tax credit for plug-in electric vehicles and other advanced vehicles to {{USD|10,000}}, over the current {{USD|7,500}}. However, the new maximum tax credit would not apply to luxury vehicles with a sales price of over {{USD|45,000}}, such as the [[Tesla Model S]] and the [[Cadillac ELR]], which would be capped at {{USD|7,500}}. According to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]], the proposal intends to transform the existing tax credit into a rebate available at the point of sale that will be claimable by dealers and passed along to the consumers. The proposal also seeks to remove the 200,000 vehicle cap per manufacturer after which the credit phases out over a year. Instead, the incentives would begin to phase out starting in 2019 for all manufacturers, and the credit would be completely phased out by 2022, and fall to 75% of the current credit starting in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140304/AUTO01/303040118 |title=White House: Boost EV, alternative vehicle tax credits to $10,000 |author=David Sheparson |work=[[The Detroit News]] |date=2014-03-04 |accessdate=2014-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310071656/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140304/AUTO01/303040118 |archivedate=2014-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite President [[Barack Obama]]'s unsuccessful attempts to raise the tax credit to {{USD|10,000}} in his previous three annual budgets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2014/09/19/tesla-ev-evs-incentives-reid-electric-vehicles/15908559/ |title=Top Democrat urges new EV incentives |author=David Shepardson |work=[[The Detroit News]] |date=2014-09-19 |accessdate=2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the proposal was included again in the FY 2016 Budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hybridcars.com/white-house-seeking-expanded-10000-alternative-vehicle-rebate/ |title=White House Seeking Expanded $10,000 Alternative Vehicle Rebate |author=Sarah Shelton |work=HybridCars.com |date=2015-02-03 |accessdate=2015-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EV Everywhere Challenge===

On March 7, 2012, President [[Barack Obama]] launched the EV Everywhere Challenge as part of the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]’s Clean Energy Grand Challenges, which seeks to solve some of the U.S. biggest energy challenges and make clean energy technologies affordable and accessible to the vast majority of American households and businesses. The EV Everywhere Challenge has the goal of advancing electric vehicle technologies to have the country, by 2022, to produce a five-passenger electric vehicle that would provide both a payback time of less than five years and the ability to be recharged quickly enough to provide enough range for the typical American driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/articles/president-obama-launches-ev-everywhere-challenge-part-energy-department-s-clean-energy |title=President Obama Launches EV-Everywhere Challenge as Part of Energy Department's Clean Energy Grand Challenges |author=[[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DoE) |publisher=DoE |date=2012-03-07 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://green.autoblog.com/2012/03/11/obamas-ev-everywhere-plan-sets-2022-goals-for-u-s-made-electri/ |title=Obama's EV Everywhere plan sets 2022 goals for U.S.-made electric vehicles |author=Danny King |publisher=Autoblog Green |date=2012-03-11 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:DoE EV Everywhere Blueprint p6.png|thumb|left|DoE graph showing how meeting EV Everywhere targets will significantly lower PEV 5-year cost of ownership (purchase cost plus fuel).&lt;ref name=PEVsHEVs/&gt;]]
In January 2013 the Department of Energy (DoE) published the "EV Everywhere Grand Challenge Blueprint," which set the technical targets of the PEV program to fall into four areas: battery research and development; electric drive system research and development; vehicle lightweighting; and advanced climate control technologies. The DoE set several specific goals, established in consultation with stakeholders through a series of workshops held during the second half of 2012.&lt;ref name=PEVsHEVs/&gt; The key goals to be met over the next five years to make plug-in electric vehicles competitive with conventional fossil fuel vehicles are:
*Cutting battery costs from their current {{USD|500}}/[[kWh]] to {{USD|125}}/kWh
*Eliminating almost 30% of vehicle weight through lightweighting
*Reducing the cost of electric drive systems from {{USD|30}}/kW to {{USD|8}}/kW

Achieving these goals in the next five years will result in an automotive propulsion battery with five-times the present range capacity, costing one-fifth present lithium-ion batteries. The DoE aim is to level the purchase plus operating (fuel) cost of an [[all-electric vehicle]] with a {{convert|280|mi|abbr=on}} range with the costs of an [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE) vehicle of similar size. The DoE expects than even before the latter goals are met, the 5-year [[total cost of ownership|cost of ownership]] of most [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s and of all-electric vehicles with shorter ranges, such as {{convert|100|mi|abbr=on}}, will be comparable to the same cost of ICE vehicles of similar size.&lt;ref name=PEVsHEVs/&gt;&lt;ref name=JCESR01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hybridcars.com/energy-department-backs-plan-develop-five-times-stronger-ev-battery-65781 |title=Energy Department Backs Plan To Develop Five-Times More Energy Dense EV Battery |author=Jeff Cobb |publisher=HybridCars.com |date=2012-12-07 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Steven Chu announces Workplace Charging Challenge.jpg|thumb|Energy Secretary [[Steven Chu]] announcing the new Workplace Charging Challenge at the 2013 [[Washington Auto Show]]]]

In order to achieve these goals, the DoE is providing up to {{USD|120}} million over the next five years to fund the new [[Joint Center for Energy Storage Research]] (JCESR), a research center led by the [[Argonne National Laboratory]] in Chicago. JCESR is a consortium of five DOE national labs, five universities, and four private-sector enterprises, and it is being likened to the [[Manhattan Project]] of battery technology.&lt;ref name=JCESR01/&gt;&lt;ref name=JCESR02&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wot.motortrend.com/new-doe-funded-jcesr-consortium-aims-to-make-u-s-a-battery-powerhouse-299473.html#axzz2MOZqCy7w |title=New JCESR Consortium Aims to Make U.S. a Battery Powerhouse |author=Benson Kong |publisher=[[Motor Trend]] |date=2012-12-02 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An initial progress report for the initiative was released in January 2014. Four key successes of the first year of the initiative were reported:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/02/f8/eveverywhere_road_to_success.pdf |title=EV Everywhere Grand Challenge: Road to Success |author=[[U.S. Department of Energy]] |publisher=U.S. DoE |date=January 2014 |accessdate=2014-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*DOE research and development reduced the cost of electric drive vehicle batteries to {{USD|325}}/ kWhr, 50% lower than 2010 costs.
*In the first year of the Workplace Charging Challenge, more than 50 U.S. employers joined the Challenge and pledged to provide charging access at more than 150 sites.
*DOE investments in EV Everywhere technology topped {{USD|225 million}} in 2013, addressing key barriers to achieving the Grand Challenge.
*Consumer acceptance of electric vehicles grew: 97,000 plug-in electric vehicles were sold in 2013, nearly doubling 2012 sales.

;Workplace Charging Challenge
In January 2013, during the [[Washington Auto Show]], Secretary of Energy [[Steven Chu]] announced an initiative to expand the EV Everywhere program with the “Workplace Charging Challenge.” This initiative is a plan to install more electric vehicle charging stations in workplace parking lots. There are 21 founding partners and ambassadors for the program, including Ford, Chrysler, General Motors, Nissan, [[Tesla Motors]], [[3M]], [[Google]], [[Verizon]], [[Duke Energy]], [[General Electric]], [[San Diego Gas &amp; Electric]], [[Siemens]], [[Plug In America]], and the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]]. The initiative's target is to increase the number of U.S. employers offering workplace charging by tenfold in the next five years. Initially, the DoE will not provide funding for this initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-02-04/business/36731377_1_energy-efficiency-consumers-efficient-cars |title=Five take-aways from the Washington Auto Show's energy efficiency policy summit |author=Mohana Ravindranath |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2013-02-04 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://green.autoblog.com/2013/01/31/ev-everywhere-plan-expands-with-workplace-charging-challenge/ |title=EV Everywhere expands with Workplace Charging Challenge |author=Sebastian Blanco |publisher=Autoblog Green |date=2013-01-31 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U.S. Air Force]] officials announced, in August 2011, a plan to establish [[Los Angeles Air Force Base]], California, as the first federal facility to replace 100% of its general purpose fleet with plug-in electric vehicles. As part of the program, all Air Force-owned and -leased general purpose fleet vehicles on the base will be replaced with PEVs. There are approximately 40 eligible vehicles, ranging from passenger sedans to two-ton trucks and shuttle buses. The replacement PEVs include all-electric, plug-in hybrids, and extended-range electric vehicles. The initiative would not include force protection, tactical and emergency response vehicles. The program is also subject to environmental review. Electrification of Los Angeles AFB's general purpose fleet is the first step in a Department of Defense effort to establish strategies for large-scale integration of PEVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123270249/ |title=Los Angeles AFB to go electric |publisher=af.mil |date=2011-08-31 |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2013, it was announced that, as part of a test program created in January 2013, 500 plug-in electric vehicles with vehicle-to-ground (V2G) technology would be in use at six military bases, purchased using an investment of $20 million. If the program succeeds, there will be 3,000 V2G vehicles in 30 bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insideevs.com/us-military-to-soon-own-largest-federal-fleet-of-v2g-plug-in-vehicles/ |title=US Military to Soon Own Largest Federal Fleet of V2G Plug-In Vehicles |work=Inside EVs |date=May 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2014 |author=Loveday, Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on the source of the electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Sperling, Daniel |author2=Deborah Gordon |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability |year=2009 |pages=22–26 and 114–139 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], New York |isbn=978-0-19-537664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles operating in all-electric mode do not emit [[greenhouse gases]] from the onboard source of power, but from the point of view of a [[Tank-to-wheel|well-to-wheel assessment]], the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for [[electricity generation]]. From the perspective of a full [[life cycle analysis]], the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as [[wind power|wind]], [[solar energy|solar]], [[hydroelectric]], or [[nuclear power]] for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;&lt;ref name=PEVs&gt;{{cite book |title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington? |editor=[[David B.

===EPA estimates===
[[File:Green Car (Rechargable) row retouched.jpg|thumb|Several [[Nissan Leaf]]s, [[Chevrolet Volt]]s and [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid]]s charging at a parking lot reserved for plug-in electric vehicles in California]]
The following table compares tailpipe and upstream {{CO2}} emissions estimated by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] for all series production [[model year]] 2014 plug-in electric vehicles available in the U.S. market. Total emissions include the emissions associated with the production and distribution of electricity used to charge the vehicle, and for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, it also includes emissions associated with tailpipe emissions produced from the [[internal combustion engine]]. These figures were published by the EPA in October 2014 in its annual report "''Light-Duty Automotive Technology, Carbon Dioxide Emissions, and Fuel Economy Trends''." All emissions are estimated considering average real world city and highway operation based on the EPA 5-cycle label methodology, using a weighted 55% city and 45% highway driving.&lt;ref name=EPAtrends2014/&gt;

For purposes of an accurate estimation of emissions, the analysis took into consideration the differences in operation between plug-in hybrids. Some, like the [[Chevrolet Volt]], can operate in [[all-electric mode]] without using gasoline, and others operate in a blended mode like the [[Toyota Prius PHV]], which uses both energy stored in the battery and energy from the gasoline tank to propel the vehicle, but that can deliver substantial all-electric driving in blended mode. In addition, since the [[all-electric range]] of plug-in hybrids depends on the size of the battery pack, the analysis introduced a utility factor as a projection of the share of miles that will be driven using electricity by an average driver, for both, electric only and blended EV modes. Since all-electric cars do not produce tailpipe emissions, the utility factor applies only to plug-in hybrids. The following table shows the overall fuel economy expressed in terms of [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]] (mpg-e) and the utility factor for the ten MY2014 plug-in hybrids available in the U.S. market, and EPA's best estimate of the {{CO2}} [[tailpipe emissions]] produced by these PHEVs.&lt;ref name=EPAtrends2014/&gt;

In order to account for the upstream {{CO2}} emissions associated with the production and distribution of electricity, and since electricity production in the United States varies significantly from region to region, the EPA considered three scenarios/ranges with the low end scenario corresponding to the California powerplant emissions factor, the middle of the range represented by the national average powerplant emissions factor, and the upper end of the range corresponding to the powerplant emissions factor for the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The EPA estimates that the electricity GHG emission factors for various regions of the country vary from 346 g {{CO2}}/[[kWh]] in California to 986 g {{CO2}}/kWh in the Rockies, with a national average of 648 g {{CO2}}/kWh.&lt;ref name=EPAtrends2014/&gt;

====2012 study====
The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] (UCS) published a study in 2012 that assessed average greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. resulting from charging plug-in car batteries from the perspective of the full life-cycle ([[well-to-wheel]] analysis) and according to fuel and technology used to generate electric power by region. The study used the [[Nissan Leaf]] all-electric car to establish the analysis baseline, and electric-utility emissions are based on EPA's 2009 estimates. The UCS study expressed the results in terms of [[miles per gallon]] instead of the conventional unit of grams of greenhouse gases or [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] emissions per year in order to make the results more friendly for consumers. The study found that in areas where electricity is generated from natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric or renewable sources, the potential of plug-in electric cars to reduce greenhouse emissions is significant. On the other hand, in regions where a high proportion of power is generated from coal, [[hybrid electric car]]s produce less {{CO2}}-e equivalent emissions than plug-in electric cars, and the best fuel efficient gasoline-powered [[subcompact car]] produces slightly less emissions than a PEV. In the worst-case scenario, the study estimated that for a region where all energy is generated from coal, a plug-in electric car would emit greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to a gasoline car rated at a combined city/highway driving fuel economy of {{Convert|30|mpgUS|abbr=on}}. In contrast, in a region that is completely reliant on natural gas, the PEV would be equivalent to a gasoline-powered car rated at {{Convert|50|mpgUS|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=UCS2012EVs/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTCO201&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/automobiles/how-green-are-electric-cars-depends-on-where-you-plug-in.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1&amp;pagewanted=all |title=How Green Are Electric Cars? Depends on Where You Plug In |author=Paul Stenquist |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-04-13 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study concluded that for 45% of the U.S. population, a plug-in electric car will generate lower {{CO2}} equivalent emissions than a gasoline-powered car capable of combined {{Convert|50|mpgUS|abbr=on}}, such as the [[Toyota Prius (XW30)|Toyota Prius]] and the [[Prius c]]. The study also found that for 37% of the population, the electric car emissions will fall in the range of a gasoline-powered car rated at a combined fuel economy of {{Convert|41|to|50|mpgUS|abbr=on}}, such as the [[Honda Civic Hybrid#Third generation (2011- )|Honda Civic Hybrid]] and the [[Lexus CT200h]]. Only 18% of the population lives in areas where the power-supply is more dependent on burning carbon, and the greenhouse gas emissions will be equivalent to a car rated at a combined fuel economy of {{Convert|31|to|40|mpgUS|abbr=on}}, such as the [[Chevrolet Cruze#2008–present (J300)|Chevrolet Cruze]] and [[Ford Focus (third generation)|Ford Focus]].&lt;ref name=NYTCO201/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTCO202&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/13/automobiles/Sorting-Out-the-Power-Grid.html?emc=eta1 |title=Carbon In, Carbon Out: Sorting Out the Power Grid |author=Paul Stenquist |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-04-13 |accessdate=2012-04-14}} ''See map for regional results''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTCO203&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2012/04/15/automobiles/15POWERemissions-ch.html?ref=automobiles |title=When it Comes to Carbon Dioxide, Lower is Better and Zero is Perfect |author=Paul Stenquist |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-04-13 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that there are no regions in the U.S. where plug-in electric cars will have higher greenhouse gas emissions than the average new compact gasoline engine automobile, and the area with the dirtiest power supply produces  {{CO2}} emissions equivalent to a gasoline-powered car rated at {{Convert|33|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=UCS2012EVs/&gt;

====2014 update====
In September 2014 the UCS published an updated analysis of its 2012 report. The 2014 analysis found that 60% of Americans, up from 45% in 2009, live in regions where an all-electric car produce fewer {{CO2}} equivalent emissions per mile than the most efficient hybrid. The UCS study found several reasons for the improvement. First, electric utilities have adopted cleaner sources of electricity to their mix between the two analysis. The 2014 study used electric-utility emissions based on EPA's 2010 estimates, but since coal use nationwide is down by about 5% from 2010 to 2014, actual efficiency in 2014 is expected to be better than estimated in the UCS study. Second, electric vehicles have become more efficient, as the average model year 2013 all-electric vehicle used 0.325 kWh/mile, representing a 5% improvement over 2011 models. The Nissan Leaf, used as the reference model for the baseline of the 2012 study, was upgraded in model year 2013 to achieve a rating of 0.30 kWh/mile, a 12% improvement over the 2011 model year model rating of 0.34 kWh/mile.  Also, some new models are cleaner than the average, such as the [[BMW i3]], which is rated at 0.27 kWh by the EPA. An i3 charged with power from the Midwest grid would be as clean as a gasoline-powered car with about {{Convert|50|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on}}, up from {{Convert|39|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on}} for the average electric car in the 2012 study. In states with a cleaner mix generation, the gains were larger. The average all-electric car in California went up to {{Convert|95|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on}} equivalent from {{Convert|78|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on}} in the 2012 study. States with dirtier generation that rely heavily on coal still lag, such as Colorado, where the average BEV only achieves the same emissions as a {{Convert|34|mpgUS|abbr=on}} gasoline-powered car. The author of the 2014 analysis noted that the benefits are not distributed evenly across the U.S. because electric car adoptions is concentrated in the states with cleaner power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/automobiles/coal-fades-so-electrics-get-cleaner.html |title=Coal Fades, So Electrics Get Cleaner |author=Paul Stenquist |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2014-09-19 |accessdate=2014-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.ucsusa.org/how-do-electric-cars-compare-with-gas-cars-656?_ga=1.204480851.2146914018.1410916275 |title=How do EVs Compare with Gas-Powered Vehicles?

In November 2015 the Union of Concerned Scientists published a new report comparing two [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEVs) with similar gasoline vehicles by examining their global warming emissions over their full life-cycle, [[Life-cycle assessment#Cradle-to-grave|cradle-to-grave]] analysis. The two BEVs modeled, midsize and full-size, are based on the two most popular BEV models sold in the United States in 2015, the Nissan Leaf and the [[Tesla Model S]]. The study found that all-electric cars representative of those sold today, on average produce less than half the global warming emissions of comparable gasoline-powered vehicles, despite taken into account the higher emissions associated with BEV manufacturing. Considering the regions where the two most popular electric cars are being sold, excess manufacturing emissions are offset within 6 to 16 months of average driving. The study also concluded that driving an average EV results in lower global warming emissions than driving a gasoline car that gets {{Convert|50|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on}} in regions covering two-thirds of the U.S. population, up from 45% in 2009. Based on where EVs are being sold in the United States in 2015, the average EV produces global warming emissions equal to a gasoline vehicle with a {{Convert|68|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on}} fuel economy rating. The authors identified two main reason for the fact that EV-related emissions have become even lower in many parts of the country since the first study was conducted in 2012. Electricity generation has been getting cleaner, as coal-fired generation has declined while lower-carbon alternatives have increased. In addition, electric cars are becoming more efficient. For example, the Nissan Leaf and the [[Chevrolet Volt]], have undergone improvements to increase their efficiencies compared to the original models launched in 2010, and other even more efficient BEV models, such as the most lightweight and efficient [[BMW i3]], have entered the market.&lt;ref name=UCS2015&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-full-report.pdf |title=Cleaner Cars from Cradle to Grave: How Electric Cars Beat Gasoline Cars on Lifetime Global Warming Emissions |publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] (UCS) |last1=Nealer |first1=Rachael |last2=Reichmuth |first2=David |last3=Anair |first3=Don |date=November 2015 |accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One criticism to the UCS analysis and several other that have analyze the benefits of PEVs is that these analysis were made using average emissions rates across regions instead of marginal generation at different times of the day. The former approach does not take into account the generation mix within interconnected electricity markets and shifting load profiles throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21634544-are-zero-emission-vehicles-cleaner-petrol-cars-it-all-depends-zevs-invisible |title=The ZEV’s invisible tailpipe - Are zero-emission vehicles cleaner than petrol cars?

See pp. 251&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis by three economist affiliated with the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER), published in November 2014, developed a methodology to estimate marginal emissions of electricity demand that vary by location and time of day across the United States. The study used emissions and consumption data for 2007 through 2009, and used the specifications for the [[Chevrolet Volt]] ([[all-electric range]] of {{Convert|35|mi|abbr=on}}). The analysis found that marginal emission rates are more than three times as large in the [[Upper Midwest]] compared to the [[Western U.S.]], and within regions, rates for some hours of the day are more than twice those for others.&lt;ref name=NBER2014/&gt; Applying the results of the marginal analysis to plug-in electric vehicles, the NBER researchers found that the emissions of charging PEVs vary by region and hours of the day. In some regions, such as the Western U.S. and Texas, {{CO2}} emissions per mile from driving PEVs are less than those from driving a hybrid car. However, in other regions, such as the Upper Midwest, charging during the recommended hours of midnight to 4 a.m. implies that PEVs generate more emissions per mile than the average car currently on the road. The results show a fundamental tension between electricity load management and environmental goals as the hours when electricity is the least expensive to produce tend to be the hours with the greatest emissions. This occurs because coal-fired units, which have higher emission rates, are most commonly used to meet base-level and
off-peak electricity demand; while natural gas units, which have relatively low emissions rates, are often brought online to meet peak demand. This pattern of fuel shifting explains why emission rates tend to be higher at night and lower during periods of peak demand in the morning and evening.&lt;ref name=NBER2014/&gt;

==Environmental footprint==
In February 2014, the Automotive Science Group (ASG) published the result of a study conducted to [[Life-cycle assessment|assess the life-cycle]] of over 1,300 automobiles across nine categories sold in North America. The study found that among advanced automotive technologies, the Nissan Leaf holds the smallest life-cycle environmental footprint of any model year 2014 automobile available in the North American market with minimum four-person occupancy. The study concluded that the increased environmental impacts of manufacturing the battery electric technology is more than offset with increased environmental performance during operational life. For the assessment, the study used the average electricity mix of the U.S. grid in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automotivescience.com/press/4582462907 |title=Life-cycle Assessment of 1,300 Models Reveals Best of 2014 |author=Automotive Science Group (ASG) |publisher=ASG Press Room |date=2014-02-04 |accessdate=2014-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302031302/http://www.automotivescience.com/press/4582462907 |archivedate=2014-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2014 [[mid-size car]]s category, the Leaf also ranked as the best all-around performance, best environmental and best social performance.

[[File:Smart Fortwo car2go in San Diego.JPG|thumb|[[Smart Fortwo electric drive]] on service for the [[Car2Go]] [[carsharing]] service in [[San Diego]], California]]

[[Car2Go]] made [[San Diego]]  the only North American city with an all-electric [[carsharing]] fleet when it launched service in 2011. {{As of|2016|03}}, the carsharing service has 40,000 members and 400 all-electric [[Smart ED]]s in operation. However, due to lack of enough charging infrastructure Car2Go decided to replace all of its all-electric car fleet with gasoline-powered cars starting on 1 May 2016.  When the carsharing service started Car2Go expected 1,000 charging stations to be deployed around the city, but only 400 were in place by early 2016. As a result, an average of 20% of the carsharing fleet is unavailable at any given time because the cars are either being charged or because they don’t have enough electricity in them to be driven. Also, many of the company’s San Diego members say they often worry their Car2Go will run out of charge before they finish their trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/mar/16/car-share-car2go-fleet-gas-electric/ |title=Car2Go switching electric cars to gas |first=David |last=Garrick |work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=2016-03-16 |accessdate=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plug-in Electric Vehicle Readiness Index ==

[[File:Portland Electric Avenue BMW i3 2015.jpg|thumb|left|[[Portland, Oregon]] ranks at the top of the list of major American cities that are the most ready to accommodate PEVs. Shown a [[BMW i3]] charging at Portland Electric Avenue.]]

Researchers from the [[Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs]] developed an index that identifies and ranks the municipal plug-in electric vehicle readiness ("PEV readiness"). The evaluation ranked the U.S. 25 largest cities by population along with five other large cities that have been included in other major PEV studies. The rankings also included the largest cities in states that joined California zero-emissions vehicle goal. A total of 36 major U.S. cities were included in the study. The evaluation found that [[Portland, Oregon]] ranks at the top of the list of major American cities that are the most ready to accommodate plug-in electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=PEVreadiness/&gt;

Readiness is the degree to which adoption of electric vehicles is supported, as reflected in the presence of various types of policy instruments, infrastructure development, municipal investments in PEV technology, and participation in relevant stakeholder coalitions. The study also compares cities within states that participate in the [[Zero Emission Vehicle]] program, with those that do not, with the objective to understand whether participation in that program has a meaningful impact on PEV readiness.&lt;ref name=PEVreadiness/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Plug-in electric vehicle readiness: Rating cities in the United States |author=Clark-Sutton, Kyle |journal=The Electricity Journal |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=30–40 |date=February 2016 |doi=10.1016/j.tej.2015.12.006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to accelerate the adoption of plug-in electric vehicles (PEV), many municipalities, along with their parent states, offer a variety of benefits to owners and operators of PEVs to make PEV adoption easier and more affordable. All six cities in the top of the ranking offer purchase incentives for PEVs and charging equipment. Four of the six offer time-of-use electricity rates, which makes overnight charging more affordable. The top-ranking cities also score well in categories such as public charging station density, special parking privileges, access to high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, and streamlined processes for installing charging equipment. Those services and incentives are largely absent from the bottom six cities.&lt;ref name=PEVreadiness/&gt;

The following is the full ranking of the 36 U.S. cities in 25 states included in the evaluation of PEV readiness:

Monthly sales of the Volt, Prius PHV and Leaf are performing better than the conventional Prius during their respective introductory periods, with the exception of the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, which has been outsold most of the time by the Prius HEV over their 36-month introductory periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/2013/02/20/guest-post-electric-vehicle-deployment-where-should-we-be-today/ |title=Electric Vehicle Deployment – Where Should We Be Today? |author=Melissa C.

According to Pike Research, global sales of plug-ins will surpass 1 million per year in 2017, after 7 years in the market and almost half the time it took [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s to reach that sales threshold.&lt;ref name=Pike092012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ford-toyota-will-lead-plug-in-electric-vehicle-sales-in-the-us-through-2020-forecasts-pike-research-2012-10-31 |title=Ford, Toyota Will Lead Plug-in Electric Vehicle Sales in the U.S. Through 2020, Forecasts Pike Research |author=Pike Research |publisher=Market Watch |date=2012-10-31 |accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[CAFE|fuel economy standards in the U.S.]] have become more stringent and push automakers towards hybridization or full electrification, [[Bloomberg L.P.#New Energy Finance|Bloomberg New Energy Finance]] forecast that 30% of new passenger vehicles in the United States will be plug-in hybrids or full battery electrics by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/transportation-cities-and-air-quality-is-the-future-of-transport-all-electric/ |title=Is The Future of Transport All-Electric? |author=Melissa C.

The [[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) in its 2017 Annual Energy Outlook 2017 projected that all-electric vehicles sales in the United States will increase from less than 1% in 2016 to 6% in 2040 of total light-duty vehicles sold in the country, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle sales will increase from less than 1% to 4% over the same period. According to the EIA projected sales of light-duty battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles will reach 1.5 million in 2025, about 9% of projected total sales of light-duty vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/0383(2017).pdf |title=Annual Energy Outlook 2017 with projections to 2050 |author=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) |publisher=EIA |date=2017-01-05 |accessdate=2017-02-05}} ''See pp. 97-98.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Key market features ====

According to [[Edmunds.com]], leasing of plug-in cars instead of purchasing is dominant in the American market, with leasing accounting for 51% of all new all-electric cars and 73% of plug-in hybrids, compared with just 32% of gasoline-powered cars.&lt;ref name=CSM092016/&gt;

{{As of|2016}}, the market of used plug-in electric cars is concentrated in California, the state with the biggest pool of used plug-in vehicles, especially all-electrics, followed by Colorado, Florida, Georgia, New York, Oregon and Texas. With the exception of used Teslas, all models depreciate more rapidly than conventionally powered cars and trucks. For all-electric cars depreciation varies between 60% to 75% in three years. In contrast, most conventionally powered vehicles in the same period depreciate between 45% to 50% . The Tesla Model S is more like conventional cars, with three-year depreciation of about 40%. And plug-in hybrids depreciate less than all-electric cars but still depreciate faster than conventionally powered cars.&lt;ref name=CSM092016&gt;{{cite news |url=http://m.csmonitor.com/Business/Saving-Money/2016/0912/Used-plug-in-cars-could-be-a-bargain |title=Used plug-in cars could be a bargain |first=John |last=O’Dell |work=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date=2016-09-12 |accessdate=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from the [[University of California, Davis]] conducted a study to identify the factors influencing the decision to adopt high-end battery electric vehicles (BEV), such as the Tesla Model S, as these vehicles are remarkably different from mainstream BEVs. Based on a questionnaire responded by 539 high-end adopters and in-depth interviews with 33 adopters, the 2016 study found that "''environmental, performance, and technological motivations are reasons for adoption; the new technology brings a new segment of buyers into the market; and financial purchase incentives are not important in the consumer’s decision to adopt a high-end BEV.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=1392633 |title=Exploring the Decision to Adopt a High-End Battery Electric Vehicle: Role of Financial and Nonfinancial Motivations |first1=Scott |last1=Hardman |first2=Gil |last2=Tal |journal=Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board |volume=2572 |issue= |pages=20–27 |location=US |year=2016 |accessdate=2016-09-17 |doi=10.3141/2572-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regional markets====

;By concentration relative to population

Five states had more than two plug-in vehicles registered per 1,000 people in 2015, of which, three are located in the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. [[California]] had the highest concentration with 4.68 PEVs per 1,000 people. [[Hawaii]] ranked second (2.94) followed by [[Washington (state)|Washington]] (2.32), [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (2.20), and [[Oregon]] (2.04). [[Mississippi]] (0.09), [[Louisiana]] (0.14), [[North Dakota]] (0.15), [[Arkansas]] (0.15), and [[Wyoming]] (0.16) had the lowest concentration of plug-in cars.&lt;ref name=PEVperCapitaUS2015/&gt;

Among the [[Eastern United States|Eastern states]], Georgia is the only one with over two PEVs per 1,000 people, likely the result of the generous state incentives that were offered until mid-2015. Other Eastern states with high concentration of plug-ins are [[Vermont]] (1.67), [[Michigan]] (0.99), [[Maryland]] (0.98), [[Connecticut]] (0.96), and also the [[District of Columbia]] (1.01). Among other regions, [[Colorado]] had the highest concentration with 1.09 PEVs per 1,000 people, followed by [[Arizona]] (0.93).&lt;ref name=PEVperCapitaUS2015/&gt;

{{As of|2016|07}}, the U.S. average concentration was 1.51 plug-in cars registered per 1,000 people, while California's concentration had increased to 5.83 registrations per 1,000 people.

California has been a leader in the promotion of plug-in electric vehicles as the state has in place several financial and non-financial incentives. In addition to the existing [[Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles#Federal government|federal tax credit]], PEVs are eligible for a purchase rebate of up to {{USD|2,500}} through the [[Clean Vehicle Rebate Project]] (CVRP).&lt;ref name="CVRPFAQ1"/&gt; Also, [[battery electric vehicles]] and initially, the first 40,000 applicants that purchase or lease a [[plug-in hybrid]] meeting California’s Enhanced Advanced Technology Partial Zero Emission Vehicle (Enhanced AT PZEV), are entitled to a clean air sticker that allows the vehicle to be operated by a single occupant in California's [[carpool]] or [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s (HOV). The white access sticker is reserved for zero-emissions vehicles, while plug-in hybrids use the green sticker.&lt;ref name=CAVdecal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmv.ca.gov/vr/decal.htm |title=Clean Air Vehicle (CAV) Decals - High Occupancy Vehicle HOV Lane Usage |author=[[California Department of Motor Vehicles]] |publisher=DMV California |date=March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016|09}}, the limits for plug-in hybrids and experation dates have been extended several timeas, and both the white and green stickers have the same expiration date, January 1, 2019.&lt;ref name=ARB_HOVlist&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/carpool/carpool.htm |title=Eligible vehicle list: Single ocuupant carpool lane stickers |author=[[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB) |publisher=CARB |date=2016-09-19 |accessdate=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NoCapHOV&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hybridcars.com/california-removes-green-sticker-cap-for-unlimited-phev-solo-hov-lane-access/ |title=California Removes ‘Green Sticker’ Cap For Unlimited PHEV Solo-HOV Lane Access |first=Jeff |last=Cobb |work=HybridCars.com |date=2016-09-19 |accessdate=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016 California added income-based caps to its rebate system. Buyers with incomes less than 300% of the [[Federal poverty level]] will get up to {{USD|3,000}} for a plug-in hybrid, {{USD|4,000}} for an all-electric car, and {{USD|6,500}} for a hydrogen fuel-cell car and the rebate scales down until Californian buyers with incomes over {{USD|250,000}} are no longer are eligible for incentives on hybrids or electric cars, however can get {{USD|5,000 for a hydrogen fuel-cell car}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1098988_california-ends-electric-car-rebates-for-wealthiest-buyers-boosts-them-for-poorest |title=California Ends Electric-Car Rebates For Wealthiest Buyers, Boosts Them For Poorest |first=Stephen |last=Edelstein |work=Green Car Reports |date=2015-07-15 |accessdate=2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2016, the Center for Sustainable Energy has issued more than $291 million in the CVRP for over 137,200 vehicles since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://electrek.co/2016/03/15/psa-california-clean-vehicle-rebate/ |title=PSA: California Clean Vehicle Rebate is increasing for low- and moderate-income drivers, and going away for high-income drivers on March 29 |first=Fred |last=Lambert |work=Electrek |location=US |date=2016-03-15 |access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The income-base caps went into effect on 1 November 2016.

=====Georgia=====
[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] ranked second in the U.S. after California in terms of total plug-in electric vehicles on the road by mid-2014 .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2014/06/evironmentalists_say_nj_should_do_more_to_promote_electric_vehicles.html |title=Report urges NJ must do more to promote 'promise of electric vehicles' |author=Alexi Friedman |work=[[The Star-Ledger]] |date=2014-06-29 |accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first half of 2014 Georgia ranked as the top selling all-electric car market in the U.S. at the state level with a 1.6% share of new light-vehicle registrations, ahead of California (1.41%), and up from 0.94% during 2013.&lt;ref name=TopBEVsates2013_062014/&gt; {{As of|2014|08}}, there were about 12,000 electric vehicles registered in the state, of which, about 80% are registered in [[Atlanta metropolitan area|metro Atlanta]]’s five core counties.&lt;ref name=Atlanta12K&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/print-edition/2014/08/08/atlanta-eyeing-incentives-to-install-vehicle.html?page=all |title=Atlanta eying incentives to install vehicle chargers |author1=Urvaksh Karkaria |author2=Dave Williams |lastauthoramp=yes |work=[[Atlanta Business Chronicle]] |date=2014-08-08 |accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12 months between April 2013 and March 2014, metro Atlanta was the second top selling all-electric car metropolitan market in the U.S., with a market share of 2.15% of total new light-vehicle sales in the state, 5.6 times the national average share of 0.38%.&lt;ref name=TopAtlantaMetro/&gt; [[Savannah metropolitan area|Savannah]] ranks second in the state after Atlanta, with a market share of 0.13% of total new light-vehicle sales.&lt;ref name=TopBEVmetro/&gt;

======Tax credits======
The State of Georgia considers [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s (AFVs) those that run solely on alternative fuel and do not run on regular gasoline. AFVs includes vehicles that operate using battery electricity, propane, natural gas, and hydrogen fuel cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiaair.org/airpermit/html/mobilearea/engines/Alternativefuels.htm |title=Low Emission "Alternative Fuel" Vehicle Tax Credits in Georgia |author=[[Georgia Department of Natural Resources]] |publisher=Environmental Protection Division, Air Protection Branch |accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As incentives to accelerate all-electric vehicle adoption, in addition to the existing {{USD|7,500}} federal tax credit, Georgia offers an [[tax credit|income tax credit]] of 20% of the vehicle cost up to {{USD|5,000}} for the purchase or leasing of a zero emission vehicle (ZEV). Plug-in hybrids are not eligible for this incentive because sometimes they are powered by electricity from their on-board combustion engine. There is also a 10% tax credit up to {{USD|2,500}} for the purchase and installation of qualified electric vehicle charger. This tax credit applies only to non-retail business enterprises and chargers installed at homes do not qualify.&lt;ref name=GeorgiaTax&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiaair.org/airpermit/downloads/mobilearea/engines/Alternative%20Fuels/levzevfs.pdf |title=LEV/ZEV and Electric Vehicle Charger Tax Credit Fact Sheet |publisher=[[Georgia Department of Natural Resources]] |date=2004-04-14 |accessdate=2014-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021055852/http://www.georgiaair.org/airpermit/downloads/mobilearea/engines/Alternative%20Fuels/levzevfs.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An income tax credit for the purchase of a new commercial [[Medium-duty truck|medium-duty]] or [[Heavy-duty truck|heavy-duty]] AFVs started on July 1, 2015.  Medium-duty [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s also qualify. Eligible medium-duty AFVs with a [[gross vehicle weight rating]] (GVWR) between {{Convert|8,500|to|26,001|lb|abbr=on}} qualify for a credit of up to {{USD|12,000}}, while heavy-duty AFVs with a GVWR over {{Convert|26,001|lb|abbr=on}} qualify for a credit of up to {{USD|20,000}}. The credit is capped at {{USD|250,000}} per taxpayer. Qualified AFVs must be purchased before June 30, 2017, remain registered in Georgia for at least five years, and accumulate at least 75% of their annual mileage in Georgia. Up to {{USD|2.5 million}} in total credits will be available each fiscal year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/laws/all?state=GA |title=Georgia Laws and Incentives |author=[[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]] |publisher=Alternative Fuels Data Center |date=2014-06-04 |accessdate=2014-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Access to HOV lanes======
The definition of alternate fuel vehicle for the purposes of an AFV License Plate in Georgia is different from the one for tax credit purposes. The [[Official Code of Georgia Annotated]] defines an AFV as a vehicle that has been certified by the EPA in accordance with the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Federal Clean Air Act]], therefore, both all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids are eligible for Georgia's AFV license plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plugingeorgia.com/pdf/library/GA_AFV_Incentive_Guide.docx |title=Georgia’s Alternative Fuel Vehicle Incentives |author=Plug-in Georgia |publisher=PluginGeorgia.com |accessdate=2014-09-27}} ''Download the Word file "GA_AFV_Incentive_Guide.docx"''&lt;/ref&gt; All vehicles displaying a GA alternative fuel license plate are allowed to use [[high occupancy vehicle lanes]] (HOV) regardless of number of passengers. Alternative fuel vehicles displaying the proper alternative fuel license plat may obtain a Peach Pass [[electronic toll collection|electronic tag]] that grants them toll-free access to all Peach Pass controlled [[high-occupancy toll lane]]s (HOT) lanes.&lt;ref name=PlugIncentives&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.plugincentives.com/blog/list-us-electric-vehicle-and-evse-incentives-state |title=List of U.S. Electric Vehicle and EVSE Incentives by State |author=PlugIncentives.org |publisher=PlugIncentives.org |date=2014-09-04 |accessdate=2014-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092257/https://www.plugincentives.com/blog/list-us-electric-vehicle-and-evse-incentives-state |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Time-of-use electricity rates======
[[Georgia Power]], the primary utility in Atlanta, offers a [[Time of use net metering|time-of-use]] electric vehicle plan designed for plug-in charging. {{As of|2014|09}}, the plan has about 1,500 customers statewide.&lt;ref name=TOUratesGA&gt;{{cite news |url=http://savannahnow.com/news/2014-09-25/getting-charge-electric-vehicles-savannah |title=Getting a charge from electric vehicles in Savannah |author=Mary Landers |work=[[Savannah Morning News]] |date=2014-09-26 |accessdate=2014-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a monthly fee of {{USD|10}}, the utility lowers the overnight rate to 1.3 cents per [[Kilowatt hour]] (kWh) while raising the peak rate, from 2-7 p.m. from June through September, to 20.3 cents per kWh. There is also a shoulder rate of 6.2 cents per Kwh in between those times.&lt;ref name=TOUratesGA/&gt; The average U.S. rate is 11.88 cents per kWh.&lt;ref name=TopAtlantaMetro/&gt;

======Charging infrastructure======
{{As of|2014|04}}, Georgia had 238 [[charging station]]s with 548 public outlets available across the state.&lt;ref name=ChargePoints/&gt; Of these, about 120 public charging stations are located in metro Atlanta, with only about half of these located inside the city limits of Atlanta. Considering the rapid growth of electric cars in the city, there is a shortage of charging infrastructure relative to supply of electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=Atlanta12K/&gt;

The city of Atlanta is considering legislation to attend the needs of electric car owners and others who want to provide electric vehicle charging at their business, multifamily dwelling or private home. The measure aims to remove a major barrier to owning an electric vehicle by encouraging office and residential landlords to install electric vehicle chargers and reserved parking. Under the proposal, each electric vehicle charging station would be counted as one parking space, and the minimum parking requirement for developers and builders would be reduced by one space for each charging station provided, allowing up to a 10% reduction in minimum parking requirements. The city also wants to simplify the process required to obtain a permit to install electric vehicle chargers and make the spaces more identifiable.&lt;ref name=Atlanta12K/&gt;

=====Hawaii=====
[[File:Electric Car Charging Station Honolulu.jpg|thumb|upright|A public electric car [[charging station]] in Kaka'ako, [[Honolulu]], [[Oahu]], Hawaii]]

[[Hawaii]] has a high potential for mass adoption of plug-in electric vehicles due to the limited driving range imposed by the island geographies, and its high fuel costs, with gasoline prices, {{as of|2013|09|lc=y}}, ranging between {{USD|4.25}} and {{USD|5.00}} a gallon.&lt;ref name=HawaiiParadise/&gt;&lt;ref name=EVHawaii/&gt; The number of registered plug-in electric vehicles increased from 581 units in 2011, to 967 in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilbeat.com/2013/07/19544-friday-factoid-hybrid-and-electric-cars-in-hawaii/ |title=Friday Factoid: Hybrid and Electric Cars in Hawaii |author=Staff |publisher=The Civil Beat |date=2013-07-19 |accessdate=2014-09-24}} ''Click on graph for annual sales of PEVS.''&lt;/ref&gt; and reached 1,551 units in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insideevs.com/electric-vehicles-registrations-up-83-percent-in-hawaii/ |title=Electric Vehicles Registrations Up 83% Percent in Hawaii |author=Eric Loveday |publisher=InsideEVs.com |date=2013-07-31 |accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2014|08}}, a total of 2,821 plug-in highway legal plug-in electric cars have been registered in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.hawaii.gov/dbedt/economic/data_reports/energy-trends/Energy_Trend.pdf |title=Monthly Energy Trend Highlights August 2014 |author=Research &amp; Economic Analysis Division, DBEDT |publisher=Hawaii State Department of Business, Economic Development &amp; Tourism (DBEDT) |date=September 2014 |accessdate=2014-09-24}} ''See Registered Taxable Vehicles, pp. 2.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of EV adoption, Hawaii ranked in 2013 as the state with the third highest all-electric car [[market share]] with 1.21% of new car sales, and during the first half of 2014 ranked fourth with a 1.04% market share.&lt;ref name=TopBEVsates2013_062014/&gt; Accounting for sales of pure electric cars between April 2013 and March 2014, the [[Honolulu metropolitan area]] ranks as the fourth top selling BEV metro market in the United States, with 1.71% of new car sales.&lt;ref name=TopBEVmetro/&gt;

In January 2011 the state implemented a purchase rebate of up to {{USD|5,000}} available for both the purchase of a plug-in electric car purchase and a charging station, but limited to {{USD|4,500}} for the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/energy/evrebatesgrants/rebates |title=Hawaii's Electric Vehicle (EV) Rebate Program |accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebate ended in May 2012 as high consumer demand depleted the fund.

======Electric Avenue======
[[File:Electric Avenue crooped.jpg|thumb|Electric Avenue charging stations at [[Portland State University]]]]
Electric Avenue is a joint research and development initiative of [[Portland State University]] (PSU), [[Portland General Electric]] (PGE), and the [[Portland, Oregon|City of Portland]]. The Electric Avenue was launched in August 2011 to learn about the interaction and performance of charging stations and a variety of electric vehicles. The initiative also aimed to understand the charging preferences and travel patterns of electric vehicle visitors. The charging infrastructure includes quick chargers and both Level 1 and Level 2 charging stations powered by 100% [[renewable energy]] from PGE, and offers charging at standard city parking rates. The site comprises eight on street parking spaces with seven available charging stations located along an entire block. The Electric Avenue is located in the south end of downtown Portland, at the PSU’s campus adjacent to Portland’s [[Portland Transit Mall|Sixth Avenue Transit Mall]] where light rail trains, electric street cars, buses, cars, bikes, and pedestrians share a well-integrated personal and public transit corridor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pdx.edu/electricavenue/sites/www.pdx.edu.electricavenue/files/ElectricAveLessonsV1.pdf |title=Charging Forward: lessons learned from the first six months at Electric Avenue |author=Electric Avenue Initiative |publisher=[[Portland State University]] |date=June 2012 |accessdate=2014-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Texas River Cities Plug-In Electric Vehicle Initiative======

Despite the low penetration of plug-in electric vehicles in the state, the Texas River Cities Plug-In Electric Vehicle Initiative (TRC) is one of the most comprehensive plans for electric vehicles and their infrastructure aimed to increase the long-term success of PEV adoption. The TRC initiative encompasses two major metropolitan areas in and around [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and [[San Antonio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.texasfuelindependence.org/pev/drivers/basics-101/trc-report/ |title=Texas River Cities Plug-In Electric Vehicle Initiative |author=Texas River Cities Plug-In Electric Vehicle Initiative |publisher=Central Texas Fuel Independence Project |date=2014-09-16 |accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austin Energy]], one of the project partners, had deployed 239 utility-operated publicly accessible charging stations in the TRC region by 2012.

======Pecan Street demonstration project======
This demonstration project is run by the Pecan Street Inc., a [[University of Texas]] based research consortium of research and industry partners focused on developing and testing advanced technology, business model, and customer behavior surrounding energy management systems. The project is supported by a {{USD|10.4 million}} [[smart grid]] demonstration grant from the U.S. Department of Energy and more than {{USD|14 million}} in matching funds from the project partners. The demonstration project began in 2010 and is taken place with volunteer residents at the Mueller neighborhood, a planned green community in Austin. The Pecan Street hosts an electric vehicle research program and provides incentives to participants with rebates of {{USD|3,000}} and {{USD|7,500}} to lease or purchase a PEV that is in addition to the federal tax credits. Through the research program, Pecan Street is studying grid load and monitoring home energy use through management equipment. As a result of the incentive program, Mueller has more plug-in electric vehicles per capita than any other U.S. neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pecanstreet.org/projects/smart-grid-demonstration/ |title=The Pecan Street Project |author=Pecan Street Inc. |publisher=PecanStreet.org |accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/2926417/is-this-americas-smartest-city/ |title=Is This America’s Smartest City? |author=Bryan Walsh |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=2014-06-24 |accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TRCreport&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.texasfuelindependence.org/assets/docs/TRC/TRC-EVI%20Report%202012-10-25%20FINAL.pdf |title=Texas River Cities Plug-in Electric Vehicle Initiative Regional Plan and Final Report |author=Texas River Cities Plug-In Electric Vehicle Initiative (TRC) |publisher=Central Texas Fuel Independence Project |accessdate=2014-09-27}} See pp. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[General Motors]] is a sponsor of the Pecan Street demonstration and is supporting the project to learn the charging patterns of plug-in electric car owners, and to study how a residential fleet of electric vehicles might strain the electric grid if all owners try to charge them at the same, which is what the preliminary monitoring found when the plug-in cars return home in the evening. {{As of|2013|06}}, the community had nearly 60 [[Chevrolet]] Volt owners alone thanks to GM's commitment to match the federal government's {{USD|7,500}} rebate incentive, which halves the purchase price of the Volt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=remote-control-of-electric-cars |title=Will You or the Grid Control Your Electric Car? |author=David Biello |work=[[Scientific America]] |date=2013-06-18 |accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Incentives======

New passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles that operate exclusively on electricity, hydrogen, natural gas, or propane are exempt from state motor vehicle sales and use taxes. Qualified vehicles must also meet the California motor vehicle emissions standards, and comply with the rules of the [[Washington Department of Ecology]].&lt;ref name=WASincentives/&gt; The initial sales tax exemption expired on July 1, 2015.&lt;ref name=WASincentives&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/laws/8260 |title=Alternative Fuel Vehicle (AFV) Tax Exemption (Washington state) |author=[[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]] |publisher=Alternative Fuels Data Center |date=2014-06-04 |accessdate=2014-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sales tax exemption was renewed on July 1, 2015, for four years, but the incentive was limited to new plug-in cars that cost less than {{USD|35,000}}. The approved cap excludes what legislators considered as luxury cars such as [[Tesla Motors]] and [[BMW i]] electric models. The same legislations that extended the incentives through 2019, raised the annual registration renewal fee for plug-in car owners from {{USD|100}} to {{USD|150}}.

In April 2016 governor [[Jay Inslee]] signed legislation to provide up to about {{USD|3,100}} off the purchase or lease of a new car all-electric vehicle, or a plug-in hybrid with at least {{convert|30|mi|abbr=on}} of [[all-electric range]] – such as the [[Chevrolet Volt]] and the [[BMW i3 REx]]. The new law also raises the previous purchase price cap to {{USD|42,500}}, which will allow buyers of the [[Chevrolet Bolt EV]], the next generation Nissan Leaf, and the [[Tesla Model 3]] – all with {{convert|200|mi|abbr=on}} of electric range – to be eligible for the incentive. The new law goes into effect on July 1, 2016. Under the updatede scheme, the sales tax exemption applies to the first {{USD|32,000}} of the selling price of a qualifying new plug-in electric car, which translates into a tax savings between {{USD|2,600}} to {{USD|3,100}} for plug-in car buyers depending on where the dealer is located within the state, as the sales tax vary by county. The tax exemption could expire before July 2019 if sales of electric vehicles accelerate because legislators established that the tax break should end the month after 7,500 qualifying vehicles are sold in the state.

[[File:DCA 06 2012 Chevy Volt 4034.JPG|thumb|Car dealerships play a crucial role in the sales of plug-in electric vehicles. Shown is a [[Chevrolet]] dealership exhibiting first-generation [[Chevrolet Volt|Volt]]s.]]

There are several reasons for the reluctance of some dealers to sell plug-in electric vehicles. PEVs do not offer car dealers the same profits as gasoline-powered car. Plug-in electric vehicles take more time to sell because of the explaining required, which hurts overall sales and sales people commissions. Electric vehicles also may require less maintenance, resulting in loss of service revenue, and thus undermining the biggest source of dealer profits, their service departments. According to the [[National Automobile Dealers Association]] (NADS), dealers on average make three times as much profit from service as they do from new car sales. However, a NADS spokesman said there was not sufficient data to prove that electric cars would require less maintenance.&lt;ref name=NYT11242015/&gt; According to [[the New York Times]], [[BMW]] and [[Nissan]] are among the companies whose dealers tend to be more enthusiastic and informed, but only about 10% of dealers are knowledgeable on the new technology.&lt;ref name=NYT11242015/&gt;

A study conducted at the [[Institute of Transportation Studies]] (ITS), at the [[University of California, Davis]] (UC Davis) published in 2014 found that many car dealers are less than enthusiastic about plug-in vehicles. ITS conducted 43 interviews with six automakers and 20 new car dealers selling plug-in vehicles in California’s major metro markets. The study also analyzed national and state-level [[J.D. Power]] 2013 Sales Satisfaction Index (SSI) study data on customer satisfaction with new car dealerships and [[Tesla US dealership disputes|Tesla retail stores]]. The researchers found that buyers of plug-in electric vehicles were significantly less satisfied and rated the dealer purchase experience much lower than buyers of non-premium conventional cars, while Tesla Motors earned industry-high scores. According to the findings, plug-in buyers expect more from dealers than conventional buyers, including product knowledge and support that extends beyond traditional offerings.&lt;ref name=UCDavis2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.its.ucdavis.edu/research/publications/publication-detail/?pub_id=2353 |title=New Car Dealers and Retail Innovation in California’s Plug-In Electric Vehicle Market |first1=Eric |last1=Cahill |first2=Jamie |last2=Davies-Shawhyde |first3=Thomas S. |last3=Turrentine |publisher=[[Institute of Transportation Studies]] (ITS), at the [[University of California, Davis]] |date=October 2014 |accessdate=2015-11-29}} ''Working Paper – UCD-ITS-WP-14-04.

In 2014 ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' published results from a survey conducted with 19 secret shoppers that went to 85 dealerships in four states, making anonymous visits between December 2013 and March 2014. The secret shoppers asked a number of specific questions about cars to test the salespeople’s knowledge about electric cars. The consumer magazine decided to conduct the survey after several consumers who wanted to buy a plug-in car reported to the organization that some dealerships were steering them toward gasoline-powered models. The survey found that not all sales people seemed enthusiastic about making PEV sales; a few outright discouraged it, and even one dealer was reluctant to even show a plug-in model despite having one in stock. And many sales people seemed not to have a good understanding of electric-car tax breaks and other incentives or of charging needs and costs. ''Consumer Reports'' also found that when it came to answering basic questions, sales people at [[Chevrolet]], [[Ford]], and Nissan dealerships tended to be better informed than those at [[Honda]] and [[Toyota]]. The survey found that most of the Toyota dealerships visited recommended against buying a [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid|Prius Plug-in]] and suggested buying a standard [[Toyota Prius|Prius hybrid]] instead. Overall, the secret shoppers reported that only 13 dealers “discouraged sale of EV,” with seven of them being in New York. However, at 35 of the 85 dealerships visited, the secret shoppers said sales people recommended buying a gasoline-powered car instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/04/dealers-not-always-plugged-in-about-electric-cars-secret-shopper-study-reveals/index.htm |title=Dealers not always plugged in about electric cars, Consumer Reports’ study reveals |author=Eric Evarts |work=[[Consumer Reports]] |date=2014-04-22 |accessdate=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ITS-Davis study also found that a small but influential minority of dealers have introduced new approaches to better meet the needs of plug-in customers. Examples include marketing [[High-occupancy vehicle lane|carpool lane]] stickers, enrolling buyers in charging networks, and preparing incentive paperwork for customers. Some dealers assign seasoned sales people as plug-in experts, many of whom drive plug-ins themselves to learn and be familiar with the technology and relate the cars' benefits to potential buyers. The study concluded also that carmakers could do much more to support dealers selling PEVs.&lt;ref name=UCDavis2014/&gt;

According to a 2011 study by Pike Research, annual sales of plug-in electric vehicles in the U.S. were predicted to reach 360,000 vehicles by 2017. The study projected that the highest sales between 2011 and 2017 would take place in California, New York and Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pikeresearch.com/newsroom/electric-vehicle-penetration-rates-to-be-highest-in-smaller-states |title=Electric Vehicle Penetration Rates to be Highest in Smaller States |author=Pike Research |publisher=Pike Research |date=2011-09-23 |accessdate=2012-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606075857/http://www.pikeresearch.com/newsroom/electric-vehicle-penetration-rates-to-be-highest-in-smaller-states |archivedate=2012-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, and as sales have fallen short of projections, Pike Research projected that annual sales of plug-in electric vehicles in the U.S. will reach 400,073 units in 2020, with California as the state with the highest PEV sales over the remainder of this decade, with nearly 25% of all PEVs sold in the United States between 2012 and 2020. In terms of market share, California will be followed by New York, Florida, Texas, and Washington, but Hawaii is expected by 2020 to have the highest penetration rate of PEVs as a percentage of all light duty vehicle sales. California is predicted to have four of the top ten metropolitan areas for PEV sales: [[Los Angeles metropolitan area|Los Angeles–Long Beach]], [[San Francisco Bay Area]], [[Silicon Valley]], and [[Sacramento metropolitan area|Greater Sacramento]]. Pike Research forecasts that cumulative sales of PEVs in the largest 102 American cities will reach more than 1.8 million from 2012 through 2020, with a share of more than 25% of all annual sales concentrated in the top five metropolitan areas for PEV sales: New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pikeresearch.com/research/electric-vehicle-geographic-forecasts |title=Electric Vehicle Geographic Forecasts |author=Pike Research |publisher=Pike Research |date=2013-03-01 |accessdate=2013-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126062103/http://www.pikeresearch.com/research/electric-vehicle-geographic-forecasts |archivedate=2013-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pikeresearch.com/newsroom/nearly-1-in-4-plug-in-electric-vehicles-sold-in-the-united-states-from-2012-to-2020-will-be-sold-in-california |title=Nearly 1 in 4 Plug-In Electric Vehicles Sold in the United States From 2012 to 2020 Will be Sold in California |author=Pike Research |publisher=Pike Research |date=2012-09-18 |accessdate=2013-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022063648/http://www.pikeresearch.com/newsroom/nearly-1-in-4-plug-in-electric-vehicles-sold-in-the-united-states-from-2012-to-2020-will-be-sold-in-california |archivedate=2012-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pikeresearch.com/newsroom/more-than-1-8-million-plug-in-electric-vehicles-will-be-sold-in-the-largest-102-u-s-cities-from-2012-to-2020 |title=More than 1.8 Million Plug-In Electric Vehicles Will Be Sold in the Largest 102 U.S. Cities From 2012 to 2020 |author=Pike Research |publisher=Pike Research |date=2013-01-21 |accessdate=2013-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124235316/http://www.pikeresearch.com/newsroom/more-than-1-8-million-plug-in-electric-vehicles-will-be-sold-in-the-largest-102-u-s-cities-from-2012-to-2020 |archivedate=2013-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate analysis published in September 2013, [[Navigant Consulting|Navigant Research]] forecasts that PEVs will represent a 2.4% [[market share]] of total new vehicle sales in the United States in 2022. Navigant also predicted that Hawaii will have the highest concentration of plug-in electric vehicle sales in the U.S., with 10.1% of total Hawaiian new [[light-duty vehicle]] sales in 2022; followed by [[Northern California]] with 9.7%, California as a whole will be 6.0%, and Oregon with 5.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2013/09/20130910-navigant.html |title=Navigant forecasts 18.6% CAGR for plug-ins in North America to 2022; 2.4% new vehicle share in US |author=Navigant Research |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2013-09-10 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaii has a high potential for mass adoption of plug-in electric vehicles due to the limited driving range imposed by the islands size and its high fuel costs.&lt;ref name=HawaiiParadise&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plugincars.com/hawaii-becoming-ev-paradise-128418.html |title=Hawaii Becoming an EV Paradise |author=John Gartner |publisher=PluginCars.com |date=2013-09-26 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EVHawaii&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mauieva.org/docs/EVparadise.pdf |title=Electric Vehicle Paradise: How Hawai'i Can Lead the World in Deployment |author=Berkeley Law, [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[University of Hawaii Maui College|Maui College]], [[University of Hawaiʻi]] |publisher=Maui Vehicle Alliance (Maui EVA) |date=September 2013 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an updated report published in April 2014 Navigant forecasts that the United States will remain the largest national market for light-duty plug-in electric vehicles during the next 10 years, with the PEV segment growing at a compound annual growth rate of 16.3% between 2014 and 2023, predicting that annual PEV sales in the U.S. will exceed 514,000 in 2023.&lt;ref name=Navigant2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2014/04/20140424-navigant.html |title=Navigant: US to remain largest national plug-in vehicle market over next 10 years; Tokyo to take metro market lead spot from LA |author=[[Navigant Consulting|Navigant Research]] |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2014-04-24 |accessdate=2014-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to forecasts made by Pike Research in January 2013, the United States was expected to continue to be the largest market for PEVs in 2020, but the European market was anticipated to have a higher market penetration (4.0% market share) due to its higher gasoline prices and supportive government policies, while Japan was expected to become the largest market for hybrid electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=Pike2013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pikeresearch.com/newsroom/worldwide-electric-vehicle-sales-to-reach-3-8-million-annually-by-2020 |title=Worldwide Electric Vehicle Sales to Reach 3.8 Million Annually by 2020 |author=Pike Research |publisher=Pike Research |date=2013-01-03 |accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2013/01/pikeeuev-20130102.html |title=Pike Research forecasts hybrids and plug-ins to grow to 4% of European market in 2020 |author=Pike Research |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2013-01-02 |accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar trend was predicted by Navigant Research in a geographical forecast published in April 2014.

Navigant also predicts that by 2020 annual PEV sales in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]] will surpass Los Angeles, currently the city with the largest PEV market. The PEV fleet in Tokyo is expected to reach a market penetration of 2.3% of the city's light-duty stock in 2023, and become the world's largest PEV city market with a PEV stock of around 260,000 in 2023, while Los Angeles is expected to have a stock of over 250,000 PEVs.&lt;ref name=Navigant2014_2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navigantresearch.com/wp-assets/uploads/2014/04/EVGEO-14-Executive-Summary.pdf |title=Executive Summary: Electric Vehicle Geographic Forecasts - Plug-In Electric Vehicle Sales Forecasts for North America and Select European and Asia Pacific Cities by State/Province, Metropolitan Area, City, and Selected Utility Service Territories |publisher=[[Navigant Consulting|Navigant Research]] |author1=Scott Shepard |author2=John Gartner |lastauthoramp=yes |date=April 2014 |accessdate=2014-04-27}} ''See Chart 1.1 for annual LD PEV sales in Los Angeles, Tokyo and Paris between 2014 and 2023.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mechanic]]s and geology, '''pure shear''' is a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] homogeneous flattening of a body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/visualstructure/vss/htm_hlp/pure_s.htm|title=Definition and Mathematics of Pure Shear|last=Reish|first=Nathaniel E.|author2=Gary H. Girty |publisher=[[San Diego State University]] Department of Geological Sciences|accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an example of irrotational [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]] in which body is elongated in one direction while being shortened [[perpendicularly]]. For soft materials, such as rubber, a strain state of pure shear is often used for characterizing [[Hyperelastic material|hyperelastic]] and [[fracture mechanics|fracture mechanical]] behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yeoh|first1=O. H.|title=Analysis of deformation and fracture of 'pure shear'rubber testpiece|journal=Plastics, rubber and composites|date=2001|volume=30|issue=8|pages=389–397|doi=10.1179/146580101101541787}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure shear is differentiated from [[simple shear]] in that pure shear involves no rigid body rotation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endurica.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Pure-Shear-Nomenclature.pdf|title=Where do the Pure and Shear come from in the Pure Shear test?|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endurica.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Comparing-Pure-Shear-and-Simple-Shear.pdf|title=Comparing Simple Shear and Pure Shear|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

If &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the stretch ratio applied to the material, then the deformation gradient in pure shear can be expressed as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moreira|first1=D.C.|last2=Nunes|first2=L.C.S.|title=Comparison of simple and pure shear for an incompressible isotropic hyperelastic material under large deformation|journal=Polymer Testing|date=April 2013|volume=32|issue=2|pages=240-248|doi=10.1016/j.polymertesting.2012.11.005|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142941812002218}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{F} = \begin{bmatrix} \lambda &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1/\lambda \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

The linear elastic stress-strain law for the case of pure shear is:

:&lt;math&gt;
 \begin{bmatrix}\sigma_{11} \\ \sigma_{22} \\ \sigma_{12} \end{bmatrix}
 \,=\, \begin{bmatrix}\sigma \\ \nu \sigma \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
 \,=\, \frac{E}{1-\nu^2}
 \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; \nu &amp; 0 \\
 \nu &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1-\nu}{2} \end{bmatrix}
 \begin{bmatrix}\varepsilon_{11} \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}

A '''reactor protection system''' ('''RPS''') is a set of [[nuclear safety]] components in a [[nuclear power plant]] designed to safely shut down the [[nuclear reactor|reactor]] and prevent the release of [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] materials.  The system can "trip" automatically (initiating a [[scram]]), or it can be tripped by the operators.  Trips occurs when the parameters meet or exceed the limit setpoint. A trip of the RPS results in full insertion (by gravity in pressurized water reactors or high-speed injection in boiling water reactors) of all [[control rod]]s and shutdown of the reactor.

==Pressurized water reactors==
Some of the measured parameters for US pressurized water plants would include:

*"High power", auctioneered between high nuclear power and high differental temperature (delta T) between the inlet and outlet of the reactor vessel (a measure of the thermal power for a given RCS flowrate).
*"High startup rate" (active below 10-4 percent power) at low power levels.
*"High pressurizer pressure"
*"Low reactor coolant flow"
*"Thermal margin / low pressure" (reactor power versus RCS pressure)
*"High containment pressure"
*"Low steam generator level"
*"Low steam generator pressure"
*"Loss of load" (main turbine trip)

Each parameter is measured by independent channels such that actuation of any two channels would result in an automatic SCRAM or reactor shutdown. The system also allows manual actuation by the operator.

[[File:Shellac varities.png|right|thumb|upright=1.4|Some of the many different colors of shellac]]

'''Shellac''' is a [[resin]] secreted by the female [[Kerria lacca|lac bug]], on trees in the forests of India and Thailand. It is processed and sold as dry flakes (pictured) and dissolved in [[alcohol]] to make liquid shellac, which is used as a brush-on colorant, food [[glazing agent|glaze]] and [[wood finish]]. Shellac functions as a tough natural [[primer (paint)|primer]], [[sanding]] [[sealant]], [[tannin]]-blocker, [[odour]]-blocker, [[wood stain|stain]], and [[Gloss (material appearance)|high-gloss]] [[varnish]]. Shellac was once used in electrical applications as it possesses good [[electrical insulation|insulation]] qualities and it seals out moisture. [[Phonograph]] and 78&amp;nbsp;rpm [[gramophone record]]s were made of it until they were replaced by [[polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] [[LP record|long-playing record]]s from the 1950s onwards.

From the time it replaced oil and wax finishes in the 19th century, shellac was one of the dominant wood finishes in the western world until it was largely replaced by [[nitrocellulose lacquer]] in the 1920s and 1930s.

== Etymology ==
''Shellac'' comes from ''shell'' and ''[[lac]]'', a [[calque]] of [[French language|French]] ''laque en écailles'', "lac in thin pieces", later ''gomme-laque'', "gum lac".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=shellac |title=shellac |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most European languages (except [[Romance languages|Romance]] ones and Greek) have borrowed the word for the substance from English or from the [[German language|German]] equivalent ''Schellack''.

== Production ==
[[File:Kerria-lacca.jpg|thumb|Lac tubes created by ''Kerria lacca'']]
[[File:02-Indian-Insect-Life - Harold Maxwell-Lefroy - Kerria-Lacca.jpg|thumb|Drawing of the insect ''[[Kerria lacca]]'' and its shellac tubes, by [[Harold Maxwell-Lefroy]], 1909]]

Shellac is scraped from the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of the trees where the female lac bug, ''[[Kerria lacca]]'' (order Hemiptera, family [[Kerriidae]], also known as ''Laccifer lacca''), secretes it to form a tunnel-like tube as it traverses the branches of the tree. Though these tunnels are sometimes referred to as "[[Cocoon (silk)|cocoons]]", they are not cocoons in the entomological sense.&lt;ref name="WoodworkDetails.com"&gt;Shellac, [http://www.woodworkdetails.com/knowledge/finishing/shellac WoodworkDetails.com: Shellac as a Woodworking Finish]{{Circular-ref|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This insect is in the same [[Superfamily (zoology)|superfamily]] as the insect from which [[cochineal]] is obtained. The insects suck the sap of the tree and excrete "[[sticklac]]" almost constantly. The least coloured shellac is produced when the insects feed on the kusum tree (''[[Schleichera]]'').

The raw shellac, which contains bark shavings and lac bugs removed during scraping, is placed in canvas tubes (much like long socks) and heated over a fire. This causes the shellac to liquefy, and it seeps out of the canvas, leaving the bark and bugs behind. The thick, sticky shellac is then dried into a flat sheet and broken into flakes, or dried into "buttons" (pucks/cakes), then bagged and sold. The end-user then crushes it into a fine powder and mixes it with [[ethyl alcohol]] before use, to dissolve the flakes and make liquid shellac.

Liquid shellac has a limited shelf life (about 1 year), so is sold in dry form for dissolution before use. Liquid shellac sold in hardware stores is often marked with the production (mixing) date, so the consumer can know whether the shellac inside is still good. Some manufacturers (e.g., Zinsser) have ceased labeling shellac with the production date, but the production date may be discernible from the production lot code. Alternatively, old shellac may be tested to see if it is still usable: a few drops on glass should quickly dry to a hard surface. Shellac that remains tacky for a long time is no longer usable. Storage life depends on peak temperature, so refrigeration extends shelf life.

The thickness (concentration) of shellac is measured by the unit "pound cut", referring to the amount (in pounds) of shellac flakes dissolved in a gallon of denatured alcohol. For example: a 1-lb. cut of shellac is the strength obtained by dissolving one pound of shellac flakes in a gallon of alcohol. Most pre-mixed commercial preparations come at a 3-lb. cut. Multiple thin layers of shellac produce a significantly better end result than a few thick layers. Thick layers of shellac do not adhere to the substrate or to each other well, and thus can peel off with relative ease; in addition, thick shellac will obscure fine details in carved designs in wood and other substrates.

Shellac naturally dries to a high-gloss sheen. For applications where a flatter (less shiny) sheen is desired, products containing amorphous silica,&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanwoodworker.com/blogs/shop/archive/2009/07/02/shellac.aspx American Woodworker: Tips for Using Shellac]&lt;/ref&gt; such as "Shellac Flat", may be added to the dissolved shellac.

Shellac naturally contains a small amount of wax (3%–5% by volume), which comes from the lac bug. In some preparations, this wax is removed (the resulting product being called "dewaxed shellac"). This is done for applications where the shellac will be coated with something else (such as paint or varnish), so the topcoat will adhere. Waxy (non-dewaxed) shellac appears milky in liquid form, but dries clear.

== Colours and availability ==
Shellac comes in many warm colours, ranging from a very light blonde ("platina") to a very dark brown ("garnet"), with many varieties of brown, yellow, orange and red in between. The colour is influenced by the sap of the tree the lac bug is living on and by the time of harvest. Historically, the most commonly sold shellac is called "orange shellac", and was used extensively as a combination stain and protectant for wood panelling and [[cabinetry]] in the 20th century.

Shellac was once very common anywhere paints or varnishes were sold (such as hardware stores). However, cheaper and more abrasion- and chemical-resistant finishes, such as [[polyurethane]], have almost completely replaced it in decorative residential wood finishing such as hardwood floors, wooden [[wainscoting]] plank panelling, and kitchen cabinets.  These alternative products, however, must be applied over a stain if the user wants the wood to be coloured; clear or blonde shellac may be applied over a stain without affecting the colour of the finished piece, as a protective topcoat. "Wax over shellac" (an application of buffed-on paste wax over several coats of shellac) is often regarded as a beautiful, if fragile, finish for hardwood floors. [[Luthier]]s still use shellac to ''[[French polish]]'' fine acoustic stringed instruments, but it has been replaced by synthetic plastic lacquers and varnishes in many workshops, especially high-volume production environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milburnguitars.com/fpbannerframes.html French polishing tutorial for guitars]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
[[File:Haydn shellac.jpg|frame|right|A decorative medal made in France in the early 20th century moulded from shellac compound, the same used for [[phonograph record]]s of the period]]
Shellac is a natural [[bioadhesive]] [[polymer]] and is chemically similar to synthetic polymers, and thus can be considered a natural form of [[plastic]]. It can be turned into a moulding compound when mixed with [[wood flour]] and moulded under heat and pressure methods, so it can also be classified as [[thermoplastic]].

Shellac scratches more easily than most lacquers and varnishes, and application is more labour-intensive, which is why it has been replaced by plastic in most areas. But damaged shellac can easily be touched up with another coat of shellac (unlike polyurethane) because the new coat merges with and bonds to the existing coat(s). Shellac is much softer than [[Urushi]] lacquer, for instance, which is far superior with regard to both chemical and mechanical resistance.

Shellac is [[solubility|soluble]] in [[alkaline]] solutions such as [[ammonia]], [[sodium borate]], [[sodium carbonate]], and [[sodium hydroxide]], and also in various [[organic solvent]]s. When dissolved in de-natured alcohol or ethanol, shellac yields a coating of good durability and hardness.

Upon mild [[hydrolysis]] shellac gives a complex mix of [[aliphatic]] and [[alicyclic]] [[hydroxy acids]] and their polymers that varies in exact composition depending upon the source of the shellac and the season of collection. The major component of the aliphatic component is [[aleuritic acid]], whereas the main alicyclic component is [[shellolic acid]].&lt;ref name="Merck Index, 9th Ed. page 8224"&gt;Merck Index, 9th Ed. page 8224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shellac is UV-resistant, and does not darken as it ages (though the wood under it may do so, as in the case of pine).&lt;ref name="naturalhandyman.com" /&gt;

== History ==
The earliest written evidence of shellac goes back {{formatnum:3000}} years, but shellac is known to have been used earlier.&lt;ref name="naturalhandyman.com"&gt;[http://www.naturalhandyman.com/iip/author/zinsser/shellac.html Naturalhandyman.com : DEFEND, PRESERVE, AND PROTECT WITH SHELLAC : The story of shellac]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Mahabharata]], an entire palace was built out of dried shellac.&lt;ref name="naturalhandyman.com" /&gt;

Shellac was in rare use as a dyestuff for as long as there was a trade with the [[East Indies]]. Merrifield&lt;ref name="Merrifield"&gt;{{cite book
 |year=1849

}}&lt;/ref&gt; cites 1220 for the introduction of shellac as an artist's pigment in Spain. [[Lapis lazuli]], an [[ultramarine]] pigment from Afghanistan, was already being imported long before this.

The use of overall paint or varnish decoration on large pieces of furniture was first popularised in Venice (then later throughout Italy). There are a number of 13th-century references to painted or varnished [[cassone]], often [[dowry]] cassone that were made deliberately impressive as part of dynastic marriages. The definition of varnish is not always clear, but it seems to have been a [[Varnish#Shellac|spirit varnish]] based on [[Benzoin resin|gum benjamin]] or [[Mastic (plant resin)|mastic]], both traded around the Mediterranean. At some time, shellac began to be used as well. An article from the ''Journal of the American Institute of Conservation'' describes the use of [[infrared spectroscopy]] to identify a shellac coating on a 16th-century cassone.&lt;ref name="JAIC Cassone"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the period in history where "varnisher" was identified as a distinct trade, separate from both carpenter and artist.

Another use for shellac is [[sealing wax]]. Woods's ''The Nature and Treatment of Wax and Shellac Seals''&lt;ref name="Woods,1994"&gt;{{cite journal

 |journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists
}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the various formulations, and the period when shellac started to be added to the previous beeswax recipes.

The "period of widespread introduction" would seem to be around 1550 to 1650, when the substance moves from being a rarity on highly decorated pieces to being described in the standard texts of the day.

== Uses ==
=== Historical ===
In the early- and mid-twentieth century, orange shellac was used as a one-product finish (combination stain and varnish-like topcoat) on decorative wood panelling used on walls and ceilings in homes, particularly in the US. In the [[American South]], use of knotty [[pine]] plank [[panelling]] covered with orange shellac was once as common in new construction as [[drywall]] is today. It was also often used on kitchen cabinets and hardwood floors, prior to the advent of [[polyurethane]].

Until the advent of [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], most [[gramophone records]] were pressed from shellac compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rheding|first1=Alexander|title=On the Record|journal=Cambridge Opera Journal|date=2006|volume=18|issue=1|page=59-82|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-opera-journal/article/on-the-record/96FE4339825ABFA0B857CCAB492E5655}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melillo|first1=Edward|title=Global Entomologies: Insects, Empires, and the ‘Synthetic Age’ in World History|journal=Past &amp; Present|date=2014|volume=223|page=233-270|url=https://academic.oup.com/past/article-abstract/223/1/233/1426060}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1921 to 1928, {{formatnum:18000}} tons of shellac were used to create 260 million records for Europe.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum1993Page27 /&gt; In the 1930s, it was estimated that half of all shellac was used for gramophone records.&lt;ref name=HowManufactured1937&gt;{{cite news|title=How Shellac Is Manufactured|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55073762|accessdate=3 July 2014|publisher=The Mail (Adelaide, SA : 1912–1954)|date=18 December 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of shellac for records was common until the 1950s and continued into the 1970s in some non-Western countries.

Until recent advances in technology, shellac (French polish) was the only glue used in the making of ballet dancers' pointe shoes, to stiffen the box (toe area) to support the dancer en pointe. Many manufacturers of pointe shoes still use the traditional techniques, and many dancers use shellac to revive a softening pair of shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Shellac was historically used as a protective coating on paintings.

Sheets of [[Braille]] were coated with shellac to help protect them from [[wear]] due to being read by hand.

Shellac was used from the mid-nineteenth century to produce small moulded goods such as [[picture frame]]s, [[box]]es, toilet articles, [[jewelry]], [[inkwell]]s and even [[dentures]]. Advances in [[plastics]] have rendered shellac obsolete as a moulding compound.

Shellac (both orange and white varieties) was used both in the field and laboratory to glue and stabilise dinosaur bones until about the mid-1960s. While effective at the time, the long-term negative effects of shellac (being organic in nature) on dinosaur bones and other fossils is debated, and shellac is very rarely used by professional conservators and fossil preparators today.

Shellac was once used for fixing [[inductor]], [[Electric motor|motor]], [[Electrical generator|generator]] and [[transformer]] windings, where it was applied directly to single-layer windings in an alcohol solution. For multi-layer windings, the whole coil was submerged in shellac solution, then drained and placed in a warm place to allow the alcohol to evaporate. The shellac then locks the wire turns in place, provides extra insulation and prevents movement and vibration, reducing buzz and hum. In motors and generators it also helps transfer force generated by magnetic attraction and repulsion from the windings to the rotor or [[armature (electrical engineering)|armature]]. In more recent times, synthetic resins, such as glyptol, ([[Cross-linked polyester|Glyptal]]), have been substituted for the shellac. Some applications use shellac mixed with other natural or synthetic resins, such as [[pine resin]] or phenol-formaldehyde resin, of which [[Bakelite]] is the best known, for electrical use. Mixed with other resins, [[barium sulfate]], [[calcium carbonate]], [[zinc sulfide]], [[aluminium oxide]] and/or cuprous carbonate ([[malachite]]), shellac forms a component of heat-cured capping cement used to fasten the caps or bases to the bulbs of electric lamps.

=== Current ===
It is the central element of the traditional "[[French polish]]" method of [[wood finishing|finishing]] furniture, fine [[string instrument]]s, and [[piano]]s.

Shellac, edible, is used as a [[glazing agent]] on pills (see [[excipient]]) and sweets, in the form of ''[[pharmaceutical glaze]]'' (or, ''confectioner's glaze''). Because of its acidic properties (resisting stomach acids), shellac-coated pills may be used for a timed enteric or colonic release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6620431.html Shellac film coatings providing release at selected pH and method – US Patent 6620431] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083616/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6620431.html |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shellac is used as a 'wax' coating on citrus fruit to prolong its shelf/storage life. It is also used to replace the natural wax of the [[apple]], which is removed during the cleaning process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usapple.org/consumers/wax.cfm |title=US Apple: Consumers – FAQs: Apples and Wax |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203123752/http://usapple.org/consumers/wax.cfm |archivedate=3 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When used for this purpose, it has the [[food additive]] [[E number]] E904.

Shellac coating applied with either a standard or modified [[Huon-Stuehrer nozzle]], can be economically micro-sprayed onto various smooth sweets, such as chocolate coated peanuts. Irregularities on the surface of the product being sprayed typically result in the formation of unsightly aggregates ("lac-aggs") which precludes the use of this technique on foods such as walnuts or raisins (however, chocolate-coated raisins being smooth surfaced, are able to be sprayed successfully using a modified Huon-Stuehrer nozzle).

Because it is compatible with most other finishes, shellac is also used as a barrier or primer coat on [[wood]] to prevent the bleeding of [[resin]] or [[pigments]] into the final finish, or to prevent [[wood stain]] from blotching.&lt;ref name="WoodworkDetails.com" /&gt;

Shellac is an odour and stain blocker and so is often used as the base of "solves all problems" primers. Although its durability against abrasives and many common solvents is not very good, shellac provides an excellent barrier against water vapour penetration. Shellac-based primers are an effective sealant to control odours associated with fire damage.

Shellac has traditionally been used as a dye for cotton and, especially, silk cloth in Thailand, particularly in the north-eastern region.&lt;ref name="Suanmuang Tulaphan, Phunsap, Silk Dyeing With Natural Dyestuffs in Northeastern Thailand, 1999, p. 26-30 (in Thai)."&gt;Suanmuang Tulaphan, Phunsap, ''Silk Dyeing With Natural Dyestuffs in Northeastern Thailand'', 1999, p. 26-30 (in Thai)&lt;/ref&gt; It yields a range of warm colours from pale yellow through to dark orange-reds and dark ochre.&lt;ref name="Punyaprasop, Daranee (Ed.)Colour And Pattern On Native Cloth, 2001, p. 253, 256 (in Thai)."&gt;Punyaprasop, Daranee (Ed.)Colour ''And Pattern On Native Cloth'', 2001, p. 253, 256 (in Thai)&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally dyed silk cloth, including that using shellac, is widely available in the rural northeast, especially in [[Ban Khwao District]], [[Chaiyaphum province]]. The Thai name for the insect and the substance is "khrang" (Thai: ครั่ง).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4844">A '''smoke composition''' is a [[pyrotechnic composition]] designed primarily to generate [[smoke]]. Smoke compositions are used as obscurants or for generation of signaling smokes. Some are used as a payload of [[smoke bomb]]s and [[smoke grenade]]s.

==Obscurants==
{{main|Smoke screen}}
Smoke compositions used as obscurants generate large amount of thick, usually white, smoke. The most common smoke composition for pyrotechnic generation of [[smoke screen]]s is the '''zinc chloride smoke mixture''' ('''HC''').

===Zinc chloride smoke===
&lt;!-- taken from smoke screen --&gt;
Zinc chloride smoke is grey-white and consists of tiny particles of [[zinc chloride]]. The most common mixture for generating these is the '''zinc chloride smoke mixture''' ('''HC'''), consisting of [[hexachloroethane]], grained [[aluminium]] and [[zinc oxide]]. The smoke consists of zinc chloride, zinc oxychlorides, and [[hydrochloric acid]], which absorb the [[humidity|moisture]] in the air. The smoke also contains traces of organic chlorinated compounds, [[phosgene]], [[carbon monoxide]], and [[chlorine]].

Its toxicity is caused mainly by the content of strongly acidic hydrochloric acid, but also due to thermal effects of reaction of zinc chloride with water. These effects cause [[lesion]]s of the [[mucous membrane]]s of the upper airways. Damage of the lower airways can manifest itself later as well, due to fine particles of zinc chloride and traces of phosgene. In high concentrations the smoke can be very dangerous when inhaled. Symptoms include [[dyspnea]], retrosternal pain, [[hoarseness]], [[stridor]], [[lachrymation]], [[cough]], [[expectoration]], and in some cases [[haemoptysis]]. Delayed [[pulmonary edema]], [[cyanosis]] or [[bronchopneumonia]] may develop. The smoke and the spent canisters contain suspected [[carcinogen]]s.

The prognosis for the casualties depends on the degree of the pulmonary damage. All exposed individuals should be kept under observation for 8 hours. Most affected individuals recover within several days, with some symptoms persisting for up to 1-2 weeks. Severe cases can suffer of reduced pulmonary function for some months, the worst cases developing marked dyspnea and cyanosis leading to death.

Respirators are required for people coming into contact with the zinc chloride smoke.

===White phosphorus===
[[White phosphorus (weapon)|White phosphorus]] is a popular base for smoke production. It is used in artillery shells, bombs, and grenades.

==Signalling==
{{see also|Colored smoke}}
A [[colored smoke]] composition can be used for signalling. These are usually based on a low-temperature burning pyrotechnic composition, mixed with a [[dye]] that gets vaporized and creates large, colored smoke particles. The composition is often based on an oxidizer (e.g. [[potassium chlorate]], [[potassium nitrate]], or [[potassium perchlorate]]), a fuel (e.g. [[lactose]]), an optional coolant (e.g. [[sodium bicarbonate]]), and one or more dyes.

==Fire extinguishing==

Smoke with a suitable composition can be used as a [[fire suppression agent]]. A [[pyrotechnic composition]] similar to [[black powder]], composed of 15% [[charcoal]] and 85% [[potassium nitrate]], generates thick smoke composed of particles of mainly [[potassium carbonate]], which has fire extinguishing properties. Two-kilograms [[smoke grenade]]s, thrown into burning rooms through plate-glass windows, have been used by some European [[firefighter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=yxRyOf8jFeQC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=popcorning&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=22#v=onepage&amp;q=popcorning&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispersion of chemicals==
Smoke compositions can be used also for creating [[aerosol]] of other materials than dyes. Generally the same type of pyrotechnic composition as for colored smokes is used, with the dye being replaced by the desired chemical. The devices usually have the form of [[smoke bomb]]s.

The best known such application of smoke compositions is in [[riot control]], for dispersion of [[lachrymatory agent]]s. The agent used is most often [[CS gas]], with less used alternatives [[CR gas]], [[CN gas]] and [[Adamsite]].

In agriculture, smoke compositions are used to disperse [[insecticide]]s and [[fungicide]]s. Some agents used in this manner are [[permethrin]], [[cypermethrin]], [[chlorpyrifos]], [[imazalil]], etc.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060818151755/http://www.octaviushunt.co.uk/ProfessionalProducts/products.htm], and some [[fumigation]] agents.

Smoke compositions can be also used for [[weather modification]], namely [[cloud seeding]], to provide [[cloud condensation nuclei]] for the moisture to precipitate. &lt;!-- Some obscure patent lists this use. Can't remember where. --&gt;

The '''tablet of Akaptaḫa''', or '''Agaptaḫa''', is an ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n private commemorative inscription on stone of the donation of a 10 &lt;small&gt;GUR&lt;/small&gt; field (about 200 acres)&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Mathematics in Ancient Iraq: A Social History | author = Eleanor Robson | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2008 | page = 296 }} 1 ''kurru'' = 8.1 hectares.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Kassites|Kassite]] king [[Kashtiliash IV|Kaštiliašu IV]] (ca. 1232 BC – 1225 BC) to a fugitive  leatherworker from [[Assyria]]n-occupied Ḫanigalbat in grateful recognition of his services provisioning the [[Babylonia]]n army with bridles (''pagumu'', a loanword from [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] or perhaps [[Kassite language|Kassite]]) .

==The tablet==

The [[Mitanni]] kingdom of Ḫanigalbat, here given the Babylonian pronunciation ''Ḫaligalbatû'', had been annexed under the preceding reign of [[Adad-nirari I|Adad-nārārī I]] (1307–1275 BC) or [[Shalmaneser I|Salmānu-ašarēdu I]] (1274–1245 BC) and Akaptaḫa (a [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] name) seems to have been one of the political refugees (''munnabittu'', refugee, displaced persion, foreigner) who consequently sought asylum in the Kassite kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Mémoires de la Délégation en Perse, Tome II: Textes Élamites - Sémitiques | author = V. Scheil | location = Paris | year = 1900 | pages = 95–96 }} and pl. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He made his home in Padan (var. Padnu), one of the eastern provinces somewhere ([[Jebel Hamrin]], according to Jensen) in the upper [[Diyala Province|Diyala]] region which had been claimed by the Kassites since the time of [[Agum II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Babylonian Oracle Questions | author = W. G. Lambert | publisher = Eisenbrauns | year = 2007 | page = 151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The object was recovered during the French excavations at [[Susa]] at the end of the 19th century, where it had been taken as war booty during one of the [[Elam]]ite invasions following the overthrow of Kaštiliašu IV by [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]], those of Kidin-Hutran III (ca. 1224 BC and 1217 BC), [[Shutruk-Nakhunte]] (ca. 1158 BC) and Kutir-Nahhunte II (1155 BC). 

The tablet describes itself using the same term applied generally to [[kudurru]]s as a ''narû'', "stele", and falls into the same tradition of entitlement monuments, excepting the absence of religious iconography and the format of the granting and cursing formulae. The text invokes "the gods of the king", presumably the [[Kassite deities]] Šuqamuna and Šumalia.&lt;ref name=wohl&gt;{{ cite journal | title = The Tablet of Agaptaḫa | author = Howard Wohl | journal = JANES | number = 4 | year = 1972 | pages = 85–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription uses an informal mix of monumental and cursive [[cuneiform]], precedes the royal name with a masculine ('''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''' or '''&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''') rather than the divine (&lt;sup&gt;[[Dingir|DINGIR]]&lt;/sup&gt;) or ('''&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;''') [[determinative]] and spells his name with ''-ti-li-'' in place of the more usual ''–til-'', suggesting its provincial origin or perhaps its lack of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Materials and Studies for Kassite History, Volume 1 | author = J. A. Brinkman | publisher = The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago | year = 1976 | page = 177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Akaptaḫa appears on four accounts of salaries or ration lists from [[Nippur]] as the father of Ninurta-ašarēdu, dated to the sixteenth year of an unnamed king probably [[Nazi-Maruttash|Nazi-Maruttaš]] (1291 BC), the father of Izkur-Šuqamuna, in the twentieth year of an unnamed king, that of Arunayû the twenty-first year of [[Kurigalzu II]] and as &lt;small&gt;[[DUMU (son Sumerogram)|DUMU]]&lt;/small&gt;''-Akaptaḫa'' on an inventory of gardening implements from Nazi-Maruttaš’ second year but these incidents are probably for someone else as they appear too early.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Die Personennamen der kassitenzeitlichen Texte aus Nippur | author = Monika Hölscher | publisher = Rhema-Verlag | year = 1996 | page = 21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hydrology]], '''throughfall''' is the process which describes how wet leaves shed excess [[water]] onto the ground surface. These drops have erosive power because they are larger than [[rain]] drops, however, if they travel a shorter distance their erosive power is reduced. In the case of a high canopy, higher than what is required for the drops to reach [[terminal velocity]], about {{convert|8|m|ft}}, the erosive power is increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stuart | first = Gordon W. | last2 = Edwards | first2 = Pamela J. | title = Concepts about Forests and Water | journal = Northern Journal of Applied Forestry | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–19 | year = 2006 | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/ne/newtown_square/publications/other_publishers/OCR/ne_2006_stuart001.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rates of throughfall are higher in areas of [[forest]] where the leaves are broad-leaved. This is because the flat leaves allow water to collect. [[Drip-tip]]s also facilitate throughfall. Rates of throughfall are lower in [[coniferous]] forests as conifers can only hold individual droplets of water on their needles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1605">'''Toenailing''' or skew-nailing is a popular technique that [[carpenter]]s use regularly to fix two timbers together by slanted application. The fasteners (nails or screws), used in pairs, are driven in on opposing angles. This locks the timbers together, to create a stable framework, e.g. in stud walls (partitions) or roof framing. The angled nailing makes later dismantling difficult or destructive. One of the most common places to toenail a framing member is where a rafter meets the top plate of a wall at the [[birdsmouth]]. Alternatives to toenailing include the use of [[hurricane tie]]s, joist hangers, and other engineered steel connectors that permit nails to be attached perpendicular to a member's surface.

When toenailing, nails can be driven from the inside or outside of the joint, depending on access available to use the hammer. Skew nailing is also a technique used by other woodworkers, for example a drawer or box can be glued and skew-nailed with finer nails or panel pins. Skew nailing will fasten the joint, while the glue sets, avoiding the use of clamps. A variation of toenailing is to use screws for the same purpose, which might be called toenailing or ''toe-screwing''.

This page documents the '''[[tornado]]es and [[tornado outbreak]]s of 1969''', primarily in the United States. Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes.

'''[[Uranyl]] peroxide''' or '''uranium peroxide''' hydrate (UO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·nH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is a pale-yellow, soluble [[peroxide]] of [[uranium]]. It is found to be present at one stage of the [[enriched uranium]] fuel cycle and in [[yellowcake]] prepared via the ''in situ'' leaching and resin [[ion exchange]] system. This compound, also expressed as:
UO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)·(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), is very similar to [[uranium trioxide]] hydrate UO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·nH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The dissolution behaviour of both compounds are very sensitive to the hydration state (n can vary between 0 and 4). One main characteristic of uranium peroxide is that it consists of small needles with an average AMAD of about 1.1&amp;nbsp;µm.

The uranyl minerals [[studtite]], UO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and metastudtite, UO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, are the only minerals discovered to date found to contain peroxide.

'''[[Uranyl]] sulfate''' (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), a [[sulfate]] of [[uranium]], is an odorless lemon-yellow sand-like solid in its pure crystalline form. It is prepared by dissolving [[uranium trioxide|UO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] in [[sulfuric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]].

It has found use as a [[negative stain]] in [[microscopy]] and [[Radioactive tracer|tracer]] in [[biology]]. The [[Aqueous Homogeneous Reactor]] experiment, constructed in 1951, circulated a fuel composed of 565 grams of [[Uranium-235|U-235]] [[enriched uranium|enriched]] to 14.7% in the form of uranyl sulfate.

The [[acid]] process of milling uranium ores involves precipitating uranyl sulfate from the pregnant [[Leaching (chemical science)|leaching]] solution to produce the semi-refined product referred to as [[yellowcake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metallurgy|url=http://www.mqes-uranium.com/metallurgy.html|publisher=MQes Uranium Inc.|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radioactivity]] was discovered using potassium uranyl sulfate, K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The '''vanadium redox battery''' (VRB), also known as the '''vanadium flow battery''' (VFB) or '''vanadium redox flow battery''' (VRFB), is a type of rechargeable [[flow battery]] that employs [[vanadium]] ions in different oxidation states to store chemical potential energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-27829874|title=Vanadium: The metal that may soon be powering your neighbourhood|publisher=BBC|author=Laurence Knight|date=14 Jun 2014|accessdate=2 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vanadium redox battery exploits the ability of [[vanadium]] to exist in solution in four different [[oxidation state]]s, and uses this property to make a battery that has just one electroactive element instead of two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alotto|first=P.|last2=Guarnieri|first2=M.|last3=Moro|first3=F.|year=2014|title=Redox Flow Batteries for the storage of renewable energy: a review|journal=Renewable &amp; Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=29|pages=325–335|doi= 10.1016/j.rser.2013.08.001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several reasons, including their relative bulkiness, most vanadium batteries are currently used for [[grid energy storage]], i.e., attached to power plants or electrical grids.

The possibility of creating a vanadium flow battery was explored variously by Pissoort in the 1930s,&lt;ref name="Pissoort"&gt;P. A. Pissoort, in FR Patent 754065 (1933)&lt;/ref&gt; NASA researchers in the 1970s, and Pellegri and Spaziante in the 1970s,&lt;ref name="Pelligri"&gt;A. Pelligri and P. M. Spaziante, in GB Patent 2030349 (1978), to Oronzio de Nori Impianti Elettrochimici S.p.A.&lt;/ref&gt; but none of them were successful in demonstrating the technology.  The first successful demonstration of the all-vanadium redox flow battery which employed vanadium in a solution of sulfuric acid in each half was by Maria Skyllas-Kazacos at the [[University of New South Wales]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Rychik"&gt;M. Rychcik and M. Skyllas-Kazacos, J. Power Sources, 22 (1988) 59–67&lt;/ref&gt; Her design used sulfuric acid electrolytes, and was patented by the [[University of New South Wales]] in Australia in 1986.&lt;ref name="Skyllas"/&gt;

The main advantages of the vanadium redox battery are that it can offer almost unlimited energy capacity simply by using larger electrolyte storage tanks; it can be left completely discharged for long periods with no ill effects; if the electrolytes are accidentally mixed, the battery suffers no permanent damage; a single state of charge between the two electrolytes avoids the capacity degradation due to a single cell in non-flow batteries; the electrolyte is aqueous and inherently safe and non-flammable,;&lt;ref name="UETproducts"&gt;[http://uetechnologies.com/products.htm UniEnergy Technologies Products]{{dead link|date=March 2017}} Accessed 21 Jan 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and the generation 3 formulation using a mixed acid solution developed by the [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] operates over a wider temperature range&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/VRB.pdf |title=Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries |publisher=Pacific Northwest National Laboratory |date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for passive cooling.&lt;ref name="miller2"&gt;Miller, Kelsey. [http://uetechnologies.com/management.htm UniEnergy Technologies Goes from Molecules to Megawatts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131020936/http://uetechnologies.com/management.htm |date=31 January 2016 }}, Clean Tech Alliance, 7 July 2014.

The main disadvantages with vanadium redox technology are a relatively poor energy-to-volume ratio in comparison with standard [[storage battery|storage batteries]] (although the Generation 3 formulation has doubled the energy density &lt;ref name="miller2"/&gt; of the system), and the aqueous electrolyte makes the battery heavy and therefore only useful for stationary applications.

==Operation==
[[Image:Vanadium battery.svg|thumb|Diagram of a vanadium flow battery]]
A vanadium redox battery consists of an assembly of power [[electrochemical cell|cells]] in which the two electrolytes are separated by a [[proton exchange membrane]]. The electrodes in a VRB cell are carbon based; the most common types being carbon felt, carbon paper, carbon cloth, and graphite felt. Recently, [[carbon nanotube]] based electrodes have gained marked interest from the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mustafa|first=Ibrahim|last2=Lopez|first2=Ivan|last3=Younes|first3=Hammad|last4=Susantyoko|first4=Rahmat Agung|last5=Al-Rub|first5=Rashid Abu|last6=Almheiri|first6=Saif|date=2017-03|title=Fabrication of Freestanding Sheets of Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes (Buckypapers) for Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries and Effects of Fabrication Variables on Electrochemical Performance|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2017.01.186|journal=Electrochimica Acta|volume=230|pages=222–235|doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2017.01.186|issn=0013-4686}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mustafa|first=Ibrahim|last2=Bamgbopa|first2=Musbaudeen O.|last3=Alraeesi|first3=Eman|last4=Shao-Horn|first4=Yang|last5=Sun|first5=Hong|last6=Almheiri|first6=Saif|date=2017-01-01|title=Insights on the Electrochemical Activity of Porous Carbonaceous Electrodes in Non-Aqueous Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries|url=http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/164/14/A3673|journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|language=en|volume=164|issue=14|pages=A3673–A3683|doi=10.1149/2.0621714jes|issn=0013-4651}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mustafa|first=Ibrahim|last2=Al Shehhi|first2=Asma|last3=Al Hammadi|first3=Ayoob|last4=Susantyoko|first4=Rahmat|last5=Palmisano|first5=Giovanni|last6=Almheiri|first6=Saif|date=2018-05|title=Effects of carbonaceous impurities on the electrochemical activity of multiwalled carbon nanotube electrodes for vanadium redox flow batteries|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.01.069|journal=Carbon|volume=131|pages=47–59|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2018.01.069|issn=0008-6223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both electrolytes are [[vanadium]]-based, the electrolyte in the positive half-cells contains VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and VO&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, the electrolyte in the negative half-cells, V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and V&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. The electrolytes may be prepared by any of several processes, including electrolytically dissolving [[vanadium pentoxide]] (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) in [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The solution remains strongly acidic in use.

In vanadium flow batteries, both half-cells are additionally connected to storage tanks and pumps so that very large volumes of the electrolytes can be circulated through the cell. This circulation of liquid electrolytes is somewhat cumbersome and does restrict the use of vanadium flow batteries in mobile applications, effectively confining them to large fixed installations.

When the vanadium battery is being charged, the VO&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in the positive half-cell are converted to VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions when electrons are removed from the positive terminal of the battery. Similarly in the negative half-cell, electrons are introduced converting the V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions into V&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.  During discharge this process is reversed and results in a typical [[Open circuit voltage|open-circuit voltage]] of 1.41 V at 25&amp;nbsp;°C.

Other useful properties of vanadium flow batteries are their very fast response to changing loads and their extremely large overload capacities. Studies by the University of New South Wales have shown that they can achieve a response time of under half a millisecond for a 100% load change, and allowed overloads of as much as 400% for 10 seconds. The response time is mostly limited by the electrical equipment. Sulfuric acid-based vanadium batteries only work between about 10 and 40&amp;nbsp;°C. Below that temperature range, the ion-infused sulfuric acid crystallizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110317141418.htm | title = Electric Grid Reliability: Increasing Energy Storage in Vanadium Redox Batteries by 70 Percent|author=DOE/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory|publisher=Science Daily|date=17 Mar 2011|accessdate=2 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Round trip efficiency in practical applications is around 65–75 %.&lt;ref name="vrbpower"&gt;[http://pdenergy.com/en/technology/faq/faq_1.html VRB Power Systems FAQ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213233901/http://pdenergy.com/en/technology/faq/faq_1.html |date=13 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the traditional pumping requirements, [[nanoFlowcell]] AG has developed a proprietary system of energy storage for [[electric vehicle]] applications showcased through a number of Quant vehicle prototypes, using rapid replacement of electrolyte to refuel the battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electric Vehicle Refuelling System (EVRS) used in conjunction with Vanadium Redox Flow Technology|url=http://www.poweringnow.com/applications/electric-vehicles|work=REDT Energy Storage|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206170652/http://www.poweringnow.com/applications/electric-vehicles|archivedate=6 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific energy and energy density==
Current production vanadium redox batteries achieve a specific energy of about 20&amp;nbsp;Wh/kg (72 kJ/kg) of electrolyte. 
More recent research at UNSW indicates that the use of precipitation inhibitors can increase the density to about 35&amp;nbsp;Wh/kg (126 kJ/kg), with even higher densities made possible by controlling the electrolyte temperature. This [[specific energy]] is quite low compared to other [[rechargeable battery]] types (e.g., lead–acid, 30–40&amp;nbsp;Wh/kg (108–144 kJ/kg); and lithium ion, 80–200&amp;nbsp;Wh/kg (288–720 kJ/kg)).

==Mechanisms of Electrode Permeation by Electrolyte==
A number of research groups worldwide have reported capacity loss in VRFBs over prolonged periods of use. While several causes have been considered, the influence of electrode microstructure on cell electrochemistry within the electrode is poorly known. Electrolytic wetting of carbon electrodes in VRFBs is important for overcoming sources of degradation and applying appropriate operational procedures. Recently, it appears that electrolytic wetting behaviour within the electrode may be influenced by local concentration effects as well as capillary action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tariq|first=Farid|last2=Rubio-Garcia|first2=J.|last3=Yufit|first3=Vladimir|last4=Bertei|first4=Antonio|last5=Chakrabarti|first5=Barun K.|last6=Kucernak|first6=Anthony|last7=Brandon|first7=Nigel|date=2018|title=Uncovering the mechanisms of electrolyte permeation in porous electrodes for redox flow batteries through real time in situ 3D imaging|url=https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/se/c8se00174j#!divAbstract|journal=Sustainable Energy &amp; Fuels|language=en|volume=2|issue=9|pages=2068–2080|doi=10.1039/C8SE00174J|issn=2398-4902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid wetting or permeation may also leave behind undissolved gases which could cause electrode degradation.

==Applications==
The extremely large capacities possible from vanadium redox batteries make them well suited to use in large power storage applications such as helping to average out the production of highly variable generation sources such as wind or solar power, helping generators cope with large surges in demand or leveling out supply/demand at a transmission constrained region.

The limited self-discharge characteristics of vanadium redox batteries make them useful in applications where the batteries must be stored for long periods of time with little maintenance while maintaining a ready state. This has led to their adoption in some military electronics, such as the sensor components of the [[GATOR mine system]].  Their ability to fully cycle and stay at 0% state of charge makes them suitable for solar + storage applications where the battery must start each day empty and fill up depending upon the load and weather.  [[Lithium-ion battery|Lithium ion batteries]], for example, are typically damaged when they are allowed to discharge below 20% state of charge, so they typically only operate between about 20% and 100%, meaning they are only using 80% of their nameplate capacity.&lt;ref name="BattpowerOnline"&gt;Allbright, Greg, et. al. [http://www.batterypoweronline.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Lead-acid-white-paper.pdf A Comparison of Lead Acid to Lithium-ion in Stationary Storage Applications] All Cell, March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Their extremely rapid response times also make them superbly well suited to [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) type applications, where they can be used to replace [[lead–acid batteries]] and even diesel generators.  Also the fast response time makes them well-suited for frequency regulation.  Economically neither the UPS or frequency regulation applications of the battery are currently sustainable alone, but rather the battery is able to layer these applications with other uses to capitalize on various sources of revenue.  Also, these capabilities make vanadium redox batteries an effective "all-in-one" solution for microgrids that depend on reliable operations, frequency regulation and have a need for load shifting (from either high renewable penetration, a highly variable load or desire to optimize generator efficiency through time-shifting dispatch).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17449">[[image:Voltage Multiplier diagram.PNG|thumb|right|280px|Villard cascade voltage multiplier.]]

A '''voltage multiplier''' is an [[electrical circuit]] that converts AC electrical power from a lower [[voltage]] to a higher DC voltage, typically using a network of [[capacitor]]s and [[diode]]s.

Voltage multipliers can be used to generate a few volts for electronic appliances, to millions of volts for purposes such as high-energy physics experiments and lightning safety testing. The most common type of voltage multiplier is the half-wave series multiplier, also called the Villard cascade (but actually invented by [[Heinrich Greinacher]]).

==Operation==
Assuming that the peak voltage of the AC source is +U&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, and that the C values are sufficiently high to allow, when charged, that a current flows with no significant change in voltage, then the (simplified) working of the cascade is as follows:
[[Image:Voltage amplifier explain.png|right|thumb|400px|Illustration of the described operation, with +U&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 100V]]
# negative peak (−U&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;): The C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; capacitor is charged through diode D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to U&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[volt|V]] ([[potential difference]] between left and right plate of the capacitor is U&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;)
# positive peak (+U&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;): the potential of C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; adds with that of the source, thus charging C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to 2U&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; through D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
# negative peak: potential of C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has dropped to 0&amp;nbsp;V thus allowing C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to be charged through D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to 2U&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;.
# positive peak: potential of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rises to 2U&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (analogously to step 2), also charging C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to 2U&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. The output voltage (the sum of voltages under C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) rises until 4U&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is reached.

In reality more cycles are required for C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to reach the full voltage. Each additional stage of two diodes and two capacitors increases the output voltage by twice the peak AC supply voltage.

==Voltage doubler and tripler==
{{see also|Voltage doubler}}
[[File:Cockcroft Walton voltage multiplier circuit.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|A [[Cockcroft–Walton generator|Cockcroft-Walton]] voltage doubler circuit. It generates a DC output voltage '''''V''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''' of twice the peak-to-peak AC input voltage '''''V''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''']]
A ''voltage doubler'' uses two stages to approximately double the DC voltage that would have been obtained from a single-stage [[rectifier]]. An example of a voltage doubler is found in the input stage of [[switch mode power supply|switch mode power supplies]] containing a SPDT switch to select either 120 V or 240 V supply. In the 120 V position the input is typically configured as a full-wave voltage doubler by opening one AC connection point of a bridge rectifier, and connecting the input to the junction of two series-connected filter capacitors. For 240 V operation, the switch configures the system as a full-wave bridge, re-connecting the capacitor center-tap wire to the open AC terminal of a bridge rectifier system. This allows 120 or 240 V operation with the addition of a simple SPDT switch.

A ''voltage tripler'' is a three-stage voltage multiplier. A tripler is a popular type of voltage multiplier. The output voltage of a tripler is in practice below three times the peak input voltage due to their high [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], caused in part by the fact that as each [[capacitor]] in the chain supplies power to the next, it partially discharges, losing voltage doing so.

Triplers were commonly used in color television receivers to provide the high voltage for the [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT, picture tube). 

Triplers are still used in [[high voltage]] supplies such as [[copier]]s, [[laser printer]]s, [[bug zapper]]s and [[electroshock weapon]]s.

While the multiplier can be used to produce thousands of volts of output, the individual components do not need to be rated to withstand the entire voltage range. Each component only needs to be concerned with the relative voltage differences directly across its own terminals and of the components immediately adjacent to it.

Typically a voltage multiplier will be physically arranged like a ladder, so that the progressively increasing voltage potential is not given the opportunity to arc across to the much lower potential sections of the circuit.

Note that some safety margin is needed across the relative range of voltage differences in the multiplier, so that the ladder can survive the shorted failure of at least one diode or capacitor component. Otherwise a single-point shorting failure could successively over-voltage and destroy each next component in the multiplier, potentially destroying the entire multiplier chain.

An even number of diode-capacitor cells is used in any column so that the cascade ends on a smoothing cell.  If it were odd and ended on a clamping cell the [[Ripple (electrical)|ripple]] voltage would be very large.  Larger capacitors in the connecting column also reduce ripple but at the expense of charging time and increased diode current.

===Dickson charge pump===
[[File:Dickson voltage multiplier.svg|thumb|350px|Standard Dickson charge pump (4 stages : 5&amp;times; multiplier)]]
The '''Dickson charge pump''', or '''Dickson multiplier''', is a modification of the [[Cockcroft–Walton generator|Greinacher/Cockcroft–Walton multiplier]].  Unlike that circuit, however, the Dickson multiplier takes a DC supply as its input so is a form of [[DC-to-DC converter]].  Also, unlike Greinacher/Cockcroft–Walton which is used on high-voltage applications, the Dickson multiplier is intended for low-voltage purposes.  In addition to the DC input, the circuit requires a feed of two [[clock pulse]] trains with an amplitude swinging between the DC supply rails.  These pulse trains are in antiphase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liu|2006|p=226}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Yuan|2010|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To describe the ideal operation of the circuit, number the diodes D1, D2 etc. from left to right and the capacitors C1, C2 etc.  When the clock &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; is low, D1 will charge C1 to ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;.  When &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; goes high the top plate of C1 is pushed up to 2''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;.  D1 is then turned off and D2 turned on and C2 begins to charge to 2''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;.  On the next clock cycle &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; again goes low and now &lt;math&gt;\phi_2&lt;/math&gt; goes high pushing the top plate of C2 to 3''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;.  D2 switches off and D3 switches on, charging C3 to 3''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; and so on with charge passing up the chain, hence the name [[charge pump]].  The final diode-capacitor cell in the cascade is connected to ground rather than a clock phase and hence is not a multiplier; it is a [[envelope detector|peak detector]] which merely provides [[Rectifier#Rectifier output smoothing|smoothing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liu|2006|pp=226–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of factors which reduce the output from the ideal case of ''nV''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;.  One of these is the threshold voltage, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; of the switching device, that is, the voltage required to turn it on.  The output will be reduced by at least ''nV''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; due to the volt drops across the switches.  [[Schottky diode]]s are commonly used in Dickson multipliers for their low forward voltage drop, amongst other reasons.  Another difficulty is that there are [[parasitic capacitance]]s to ground at each node.  These parasitic capacitances act as voltage dividers with the circuit's storage capacitors reducing the output voltage still further.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yuan|2010|pp=13–14}}&lt;br/ &gt;{{Harvnb|Liu|2006|pp=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Up to a point, a higher clock frequency is beneficial: the ripple is reduced and the high frequency makes the remaining ripple easier to filter.  Also the size of capacitors needed is reduced since less charge needs to be stored per cycle.  However, losses through stray capacitance increase with increasing clock frequency and a practical limit is around a few hundred kilohertz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peluso|Steyaert|Sansen|1999|p=35}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Zumbahlen|2008|p=741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dickson MOSFET voltage multiplier.svg|thumb|350px|Dickson charge pump using diode-wired MOSFETs (4 stages : 5&amp;times; multiplier)]]

Dickson multipliers are frequently found in [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) where they are used to increase a low-voltage battery supply to the voltage needed by the IC.  It is advantageous to the IC designer and manufacturer to be able to use the same technology and the same basic device throughout the IC.  For this reason, in the popular [[CMOS]] technology ICs the transistor which forms the basic building block of circuits is the [[MOSFET]].  Consequently, the diodes in the Dickson multiplier are often replaced with MOSFETs wired to behave as diodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liu|2006|pp=226–228}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Yuan|2010|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Dickson variations}}

[[File:Dickson multiplier with 2nd transistor.svg|thumb|350px|Dickson charge pump with linear MOSFET in parallel with diode-wired MOSFET (4 stages : 5&amp;times; multiplier)]]

The diode-wired MOSFET version of the Dickson multiplier does not work very well at very low voltages because of the large drain-source volt drops of the MOSFETs.  Frequently, a more complex circuit is used to overcome this problem.  One solution is to connect in parallel with the switching MOSFET another MOSFET biased into its linear region.  This second MOSFET has a lower drain-source voltage than the switching MOSFET would have on its own (because the switching MOSFET is driven hard on) and consequently the output voltage is increased.  The gate of the linear biased MOSFET is connected to the output of the next stage so that it is turned off while the next stage is charging from the previous stage's capacitor.  That is, the linear-biased transistor is turned off at the same time as the switching transistor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liu|2006|pp=228–230}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Yuan|2010|pp=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ideal 4-stage Dickson multiplier (5&amp;times; multiplier) with an input of {{nowrap|1.5 V}} would have an output of {{nowrap|7.5 V}}.  However, a diode-wired MOSFET 4-stage multiplier might only have an output of {{nowrap|2 V}}.  Adding parallel MOSFETs in the linear region improves this to around {{nowrap|4 V}}.  More complex circuits still can achieve an output much closer to the ideal case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yuan|2010|pp=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other variations and improvements to the basic Dickson circuit exist.  Some attempt to reduce the switching threshold voltage such as the Mandal-Sarpeshkar multiplier&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yuan|2010|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Wu multiplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liu|2006|pp=230–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other circuits cancel out the threshold voltage: the Umeda multiplier does it with an externally provided voltage&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yuan|2010|pp=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Nakamoto multiplier does it with internally generated voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yuan|2010|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bergeret multiplier concentrates on maximising power efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yuan|2010|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modification for RF power====

[[File:Modified Dickson multiplier.svg|thumb|350px|Modified Dickson charge pump (2 stages : 3&amp;times; multiplier)]]

In CMOS integrated circuits clock signals are readily available, or else easily generated.  This is not always the case in [[radio frequency|RF]] integrated circuits, but often a source of RF power will be available.  The standard Dickson multiplier circuit can be modified to meet this requirement by simply grounding the normal input and one of the clock inputs.  RF power is injected into the other clock input, which then becomes the circuit input.  The RF signal is effectively the clock as well as the source of power.  However, since the clock is injected only into every other node the circuit only achieves a stage of multiplication for every second diode-capacitor cell.  The other diode-capacitor cells are merely acting as peak detectors and smoothing the ripple without increasing the multiplication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liu|2006|pp=228–230}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Yuan|2010|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-coupled switched capacitor===

[[File:Cross-coupled voltage multiplier.svg|thumb|350px|Cascade of cross-coupled MOSFET voltage doublers (3 stages : 4&amp;times; multiplier)]]

A voltage multiplier may be formed of a cascade of voltage doublers of the [[Voltage doubler#Cross-coupled switched capacitors|cross-coupled switched capacitor type]].  This type of circuit is typically used instead of a Dickson multiplier when the source voltage is {{nowrap|1.2 V}} or less.  Dickson multipliers have increasingly poor power conversion efficiency as the input voltage drops because the voltage drop across the diode-wired transistors becomes much more significant compared to the output voltage.  Since the transistors in the cross-coupled circuit are not diode-wired the volt-drop problem is not so serious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Campardo|Micheloni|Novosel|2005|pp=377–379}}&lt;br&gt;{{Harvnb|Liu|2006|pp=232–235}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Lin|2008|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circuit works by alternately switching the output of each stage between a voltage doubler driven by &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; and one driven by &lt;math&gt;\phi_2&lt;/math&gt;.  This behaviour leads to another advantage over the Dickson multiplier: reduced ripple voltage at double the frequency.  The increase in ripple frequency is advantageous because it is easier to remove by filtering.  Each stage (in an ideal circuit) raises the output voltage by the peak clock voltage.  Assuming that this is the same level as the DC input voltage then an ''n'' stage multiplier will (ideally) output ''nV''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;.  The chief cause of losses in the cross-coupled circuit is parasitic capacitance rather than switching threshold voltage.  The losses occur because some of the energy has to go into charging up the parasitic capacitances on each cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Campardo|Micheloni|Novosel|2005|p=379}}&lt;br&gt;{{Harvnb|Liu|2006|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

[[image:TV cascade and flyback.JPG|thumb|right|280px|TV cascade (green) and [[flyback transformer]] (blue).]]

The high-voltage supplies for CRTs often use voltage multipliers with the final-stage smoothing  capacitor formed by the interior and exterior [[aquadag]] coatings on the CRT itself.

A common type of voltage multiplier used in high-energy physics is the [[Cockcroft–Walton generator]] (which was designed by [[John Douglas Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton]] for a [[particle accelerator]] for use in research that won them the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1951).

'''Wilhelm Eduard Weber''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|eɪ|b|ər}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/weber "Weber"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-de|ˈveːbɐ|lang}}; 24 October 1804 – 23 June 1891) was a German [[physicist]] and, together with [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], inventor of the first electromagnetic [[telegraph]].

==Biography of Wilhelm==

===Early years===
Weber was born in [[Wittenberg]], where his father, Michael Weber, was professor of theology.  Wilhelm was the second of three brothers, all of whom were distinguished by an aptitude for science.  After the dissolution of the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg#History|University of Wittenberg]] his father was transferred to [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] in 1815. Wilhelm had received his first lessons from his father, but was now sent to the Orphan Asylum and Grammar School at Halle. After that he entered the University, and devoted himself to natural philosophy. He distinguished himself so much in his classes, and by original work, that after taking his degree of Doctor and becoming a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' he was appointed Professor Extraordinary of natural philosophy at Halle.
===Career===
In 1831, on the recommendation of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], he was hired by the [[University of Göttingen]] as professor of physics, at the age of twenty-seven. His lectures were interesting, instructive, and suggestive. Weber thought that, in order to thoroughly  understand physics and apply it to daily life, mere lectures, though illustrated by experiments, were insufficient, and he encouraged his students to experiment themselves, free of charge, in the college laboratory. As a student of twenty years he, with his brother, [[Ernst Heinrich Weber]], Professor of Anatomy at [[Leipzig]], had written a book on the ''Wave Theory and Fluidity,'' which brought its authors a considerable reputation. Acoustics was a favourite science of his, and he published numerous papers upon it in ''Poggendorffs Annalen,'' Schweigger's ''Jahrbücher für Chemie und Physik,'' and the musical journal ''Carcilia.'' The 'mechanism of walking in mankind' was another study, undertaken in conjunction with his younger brother, [[Eduard Weber]]. These important investigations were published between the years 1825 and 1838. Gauss and Weber constructed the first electromagnetic [[telegraph]] in 1833, which connected the observatory with the institute for physics in [[Göttingen]].

In December 1837, the Hannovarian government dismissed Weber, one of the [[Göttingen Seven]], from his post at the university for political reasons. Weber then travelled for a time, visiting England, among other countries, and became professor of physics in Leipzig from 1843 to 1849, when he was reinstated at Göttingen. One of his most important works, co-authored with [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Carl Wolfgang Benjamin Goldschmidt]], was ''Atlas des Erdmagnetismus: nach den Elementen der Theorie entworfen'' (''[[Atlas]] of [[Geomagnetism]]: Designed according to the elements of the theory''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/atlasdeserdmagn00gausgoog | title=Book Details Page: Atlas Des Erdmagnetismus: Nach Den Elementen Der Theorie Entworfen | publisher=World Ebook Fair | accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alibris.com/booksearch?qwork=-587234182 | title=Atlas Des Erdmagnetismus: Nach Den Elementen Der Theorie Entworfen | publisher=Alibris | accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; a series of magnetic maps, and it was chiefly through his efforts that magnetic observatories were instituted. He studied magnetism with Gauss, and during 1864 published his ''Electrodynamic Proportional Measures'' containing a system of absolute measurements for electric currents, which forms the basis of those in use. Weber died in [[Göttingen]], where he is buried in [[Stadtfriedhof (Göttingen)|the same cemetery]] as [[Max Planck]] and [[Max Born]].

[[File:Grave of Wilhelm Eduard Weber at Stadtfriedhof Göttingen 2017 01.jpg|thumb|Wilhelm Eduard Weber's grave in Göttingen]]
He was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1855.

In 1856 with [[Rudolf Kohlrausch]] (1809–1858) he demonstrated that the ratio of [[electrostatic]] to [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] units produced a number that matched the value of the then known speed of light. This finding led to [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's conjecture]] that [[light]] is an [[electromagnetic wave]]. This also led to Weber's development of his theory of [[Weber electrodynamics|electrodynamics]]. Also, the first usage of the letter "c" to denote the [[speed of light]] was in an 1856 paper by Kohlrausch and Weber.

The [[SI]] unit of [[magnetic flux]], the [[weber (unit)|weber]] (symbol: '''Wb''') is named after him.
