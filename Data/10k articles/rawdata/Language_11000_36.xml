'''Anti-[[Cyrillic]] protests in Croatia''' were a series of protests in late 2013 against the application of bilingualism in [[Vukovar]], whereby [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] were assigned co-official status due to the local minority population. The implementation of this decision became mandatory after the [[2011 Croatian census]], according to which Serbs in Vukovar comprise more than one-third (34.8%) of Vukovar's total population.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20899868|title=Croatia plans Cyrillic signs for Serbs in Vukovar|date=3 January 2013|accessdate=25 October 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs in the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] had been put up as the [[Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities in the Republic of Croatia|Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities]] mandates bilingual signs in any area where more than one-third of the population belongs to an ethnic minority.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23934098|title=Croatians tear down Serbian signs|date=2 September 2013|accessdate=25 October 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera English"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/04/201347172816369285.html|title=Croatians protest against Cyrillic signs|author=[[Al Jazeera English]]|date=7 April 2013|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision became subject of intense agitation by, among others, Croatian war veterans and many ordinary citizens who believe that due to events, particularly the [[Battle of Vukovar]], the city should have been excluded from the application of the law on minority rights, although protests and vandalism have occurred in other towns and cities (i.e. Split, Dubrovnik, etc).&lt;ref name="BBC 2"/&gt; The [[Serbs of Croatia]] are a minority group that have the narrowest usage of right to bilingualism among all national minorities in Croatia.&lt;ref name="Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/content/pravo-na-dvojezicnost-od-primjene-do-negiranja/24936733.html|title=Pravo na dvojezičnost: Od primjene do negiranja|author=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|date=23 March 2013|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 August 2014 [[Constitutional Court of Croatia]] decided that referendum proposal on the restriction of the use of minority languages in such a way to increase the required proportion of total population to 50%, is unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="Ustavni sud"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2014_08_104_2021.html|title=Odluka Ustavnog suda o referendumskom pitanju|work=[[Constitutional Court of Croatia]]|date=12 August 2014|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; City Council of Vukovar was required to regulate the use of minority language in its statute within a year after court decision.&lt;ref name="Ustavni sud" /&gt; [[Government of Croatia]] was required to define legal mechanism for cases when the representative bodies of local self-government does not implement the obligations under the Law regarding minority languages.&lt;ref name="Ustavni sud" /&gt; National authorities competent for implementation of laws on minority languages were instructed not to implement Law in the City of Vukovar by use of coercive measures until Government of Croatia fulfill its obligation.&lt;ref name="Ustavni sud" /&gt;

In April 2015 [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] urged Croatia to ensure the right of minorities to use their language and alphabet.&lt;ref name="B92-UN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=03&amp;nav_id=93697|title=UN calls on Croatia to ensure use of Serbian Cyrillic|work=B92.net|date=3 April 2015|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Committee report stated that particularly concerns the use of Serbian Cyrillic in the town of Vukovar and municipalities concerned.&lt;ref name="B92-UN" /&gt; Serbian Foreign Minister [[Ivica Dačić]] said that his country welcomes the UN Human Rights Committee's report.&lt;ref name="Tanjug-UN Serbia reaction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanjug.rs/news/172551/serbia-welcomes-un-stance-on-use-of-cyrillic-in-croatia.htm |title=Serbia welcomes UN stance on use of Cyrillic in Croatia |work=[[Tanjug]] |date=3 April 2015 |accessdate=11 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411211332/http://www.tanjug.rs/news/172551/serbia-welcomes-un-stance-on-use-of-cyrillic-in-croatia.htm |archivedate=11 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 August 2015, under requirement of [[Constitutional Court of Croatia]], the City Council of Vukovar decided to amend the city statute in such a way as not to provide bilingual signs in Latin and Cyrillic scripts at official town buildings, institutions, squares and streets. [[Council of Europe]] stated its regret about this decision.&lt;ref name="CoE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/home/-/asset_publisher/CWAECqDHgT3y/content/council-of-europe-supports-use-of-minority-languages-in-public-signs?inheritRedirect=false&amp;redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.coe.int%2Fen%2Fweb%2Fportal%2Fhome%3Fp_p_id%3D101_INSTANCE_CWAECqDHgT3y%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-2%26p_p_col_count%3D1|title=Council of Europe supports use of minority languages in public signs|work=[[Council of Europe]]|date=21 August 2015|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decision was taken by MP's from [[Croatian Democratic Union]] and [[Croatian Democratic Alliance of Slavonia and Baranja]] while MP's FROM [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]], [[Independent Democratic Serb Party]] and [[Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats]] left session at which the decision was taken.&lt;ref name="Telegram"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegram.hr/politika-kriminal/gradsko-vijece-nakon-burne-sjednice-odlucilo-ukinuti-table-na-cirilici-u-vukovaru/|title=Vijeće na burnoj sjednici izmijenilo statut, ukinulo ćirilicu u Vukovaru|work=[[Tanjug]]|date=3 April 2015|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ministry of Public Administration (Croatia)]] announced that it would overturn the decision if it is established to be contrary to the constitution.&lt;ref name="Index-MinUprave"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/ministarstvo-uprave-ukinut-cemo-odluku-ako-je-izbacivanje-cirilice-iz-vukovara-protivno-ustavu/836927.aspx|title=Ministarstvo uprave ukinut će odluku ako je izbacivanje ćirilice iz Vukovara protivno Ustavu|work=[[Index.hr]]|date=18 August 2015|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local civic society ''The city, that's us too'' suggested that the dispute could be resolved by putting on the right side of the entrance to local government buildings a sign in Croatian Latin script, and on the left side a sign in the languages and scripts of ethnic minorities living in Vukovar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dalje.com/en-croatia/civil-society-group-proposes-solution-to-bilingualism-dispute-in-vukovar/523185 Recommended solution to dispute],  dalje.com; accessed 2 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opposition====
*[[Croatian President]] [[Ivo Josipović]] joined in the condemnation of the events in Vukovar, saying that an added effort must be invested to prevent violence and tensions. “We have the law which goes toward full respect of the national minorities. All relevant political parties in Croatia took part in passing this law,” Josipovic said.&lt;ref name="Tanjug"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanjug.rs/news/98308/protest-in-vukovar-against-cyrillic-script.htm |title=Protests against Cyrillic in Vukovar, graffiti in Dubrovnik |author=[[Tanjug]] |date=3 September 2013 |accessdate=25 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190443/http://www.tanjug.rs/news/98308/protest-in-vukovar-against-cyrillic-script.htm |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Former Croatian President [[Stjepan Mesić]] claimed the protests in Zagreb were not ... a democratic expression of different opinions, but of intolerance... The appearance of people in military uniforms at such place ... clearly violate state law. If we consider publicly and unambiguously imposed threats that they will by using force prevent implementation of duties that every citizen and every institution is obligatory to do by Constitution, Sunday gathering at main square look like blow to the constitutional and [[Rule of law|legal order]] of our country.&lt;ref name="Novi List-Mesić 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novilist.hr/Vijesti/Hrvatska/Mesic-Poruke-sa-skupa-protiv-cirilice-udar-su-na-ustavni-poredak|title=Mesić: Poruke sa skupa protiv ćirilice udar su na ustavni poredak|language=Croatian|work=[[Novi List]]|date=8 April 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Dragan Crnogorac (politician)|Dragan Crnogorac]], president of [[Joint Council of Municipalities]], expressed concern and regret over events in Vukovar and rest of Croatia. He said that these events create a negative atmosphere directed towards the Serbian community and the Cyrillic alphabet. In this way, they undermines everything that has been achieved in previous years in building [[Toleration|tolerance]] and [[cohabitation]] among Serbs and Croats.&lt;ref name="Joint Council of Municipalities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zvo.hr/index.php?meni=888&amp;idt=21|script-title=sr:Ћирилица није ратни демон него средство комуникације|work=[[Joint Council of Municipalities]]|date=9 October 2013|language=Serbian|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bojan Glavašević, son of Croatian reporter [[Siniša Glavašević]], killed by Serb paramilitaries after the [[Battle of Vukovar]], said that use of his father's voice at the protest in Zagreb was inappropriate and that the name of his father was being used for political marketing. He said everyone has a right to peaceful protest, but condemned hate speech on the protests.&lt;ref name="SEEbiz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seebiz.eu/bojan-glavasevic-koristenje-snimaka-mog-oca-na-prosvjedu-nije-bilo-primjereno/ar-61257|title=Bojan Glavašević: Korištenje snimaka mog oca na prosvjedu nije bilo primjereno|work=SEEbiz/Media Servis|date=7 April 2013|language=Croatian|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*26 NGOs in Croatia sent a joint letter to [[Pope Francis]], voicing concern about the stance of Croatian Cardinal [[Josip Bozanić]] and several bishops who publicly demonstrated their opposition to bilingualism in Vukovar. The NGOs highlighted that the bishops' statements do not  contribute to peace and reconciliation, but rather lead to further deepening of conflicts.&lt;ref name="Pope Francis B92"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region.php?yyyy=2013&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=18&amp;nav_id=88366|title=Letter sent to pope over anti-Cyrillic sentiment in Croatia|work=B92.net|date=18 November 2013|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Križ života"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kriz-zivota.com/gradanske-inicijative-i-organizacije-poslale-pismo-papi-franji |title=Građanske inicijative i organizacije poslale pismo papi Franji |work=Križ života |language=Croatian |date=15 November 2013 |accessdate=30 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223100009/http://kriz-zivota.com/gradanske-inicijative-i-organizacije-poslale-pismo-papi-franji/ |archivedate=23 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The County Council of [[Vukovar-Srijem County]] gave support to protesters in their intent "to stop the violent introduction of bilingualism in Vukovar".

==Historical bans on usage of Cyrillic in Vukovar==
{{see also|Serbian language in Croatia}}
In 1861 General Assembly of [[Syrmia County]] unanimously adopted decision on introduction of the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] as official alphabet on the territory of county.&lt;ref name="ZVO-Franz Joseph I of Austria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zvo.hr/izvor/e9860c3c169d9c9.pdf|title=Царе Фрањо помози!|format=PDF|work=[[Joint Council of Municipalities]]|accessdate=10 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110172352/http://www.zvo.hr/izvor/e9860c3c169d9c9.pdf#|archive-date=10 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was reversed eight years later in 1869 when the Parliament of [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] adopted decision on exclusive usage of [[Gaj's Latin alphabet]] and repealed the county decision on usage of Cyrillic.&lt;ref name="ZVO-Franz Joseph I of Austria"/&gt; This caused dissatisfaction among the Serbs of Vukovar who sent a [[letter of protest]] to Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] since the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] was part of [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Citizens of Vukovar asked the emperor to protect his subjects from the parliament's decision, pointing out that the decision was unreasonable, especially since even the [[Diet of Hungary]] of the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen]] accepted their letters in Cyrillic.&lt;ref name="ZVO-Franz Joseph I of Austria"/&gt;

During [[World War II]], the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] was banned throughout the [[Independent State of Croatia]].&lt;ref name="NDH-Zabrana ćirilice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2013&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=25&amp;nav_id=769690|title=Ante Pavelić prvi zabranio ćirilicu|author=[[B92]]|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State sanctioned [[Bookocide in Croatia|Bookocide]] was carried out by the [[Government of the Republic of Croatia]] between 1990 and 2010. Books that were written in [[Serbian Cyrillic]] were burned with an estimated 2,8 million books destroyed in this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/knjigocid-u-hrvatskoj-hronika-sramnog-vremena/25129713.html |title=Knjigocid u Hrvatskoj: Hronika sramnog vremena |last=Jakšić |first=Božidar |date= 8 October 2013 |website=www.slobodnaevropa.org |publisher=Radio Free Europe |access-date= 9 May 2018 |quote=Dragoceno je svjedočanstvo, koje navodi autor, izjava ministra finansija Republike Hrvatske Borislava Škegra iz 1997. godine da će se sredstvima državnog proračuna finansirati biblioteke da iz knjižnih fondova izbace knjige na srpskom i sličnim jezicima“, objašnjava Jakšić.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 5 November 2013, the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] and [[Croatian Party of Rights dr. Ante Starčević]] adopted amendments to the city's statutes, declaring Vukovar to be a "place of special reverence" of the Serbian destruction of the town during the [[Battle of Vukovar]] and prohibited usage of [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]].&lt;ref name="Balkan Insight-Zabrana ćirilice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/zabranjena-%C4%87irilica-u-vukovaru|title=Zabranjena ćirilica u Vukovaru|work=[[Balkan Insight]]|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milorad Pupovac]], president of [[Serb National Council]], said he expects that the [[Croatian government]] or [[Constitutional Court of Croatia]] would annul this decision.&lt;ref name="Ćirilica pred Ustavnim sudom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glassrpske.com/novosti/region/Cirilica-pred-Ustavnim-sudom/lat/138525.html|title=Ćirilica pred Ustavnim sudom|work=Glas Srpske|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ANYONE KNOW WHAT IS THE FINAL RESULT OF THIS MATTER?? --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1772">In [[psychoanalysis]], '''anticathexis''', or countercathexis, is the energy used by the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] to bind the primitive impulses of the [[Ego, superego, and id|Id]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the ego follows the instructions of the [[superego]] in doing so; sometimes however it develops a double-countercathexis, so as to block feelings of guilt and anxiety deriving from the superego, as well as id impulses.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 132 and p. 479&lt;/ref&gt;

In a late work, Freud further distinguished between the external anticathexis of repression and what he called “internal anticathexis" (i.e. alteration of the ego through [[reaction formation]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Knudaheio.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sculpture in stone of Arne Garborg, located at his home in Knudaheio]]
'''Arne Garborg''', born Aadne Eivindsson Garborg (25 January 1851, [[Time, Norway|Time]] – 14 January 1924) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] writer.

Garborg championed the use of [[Landsmål]] (now known as [[Nynorsk]], or New Norwegian), as a literary language; he translated the [[Odyssey]] into it. He founded the weekly ''Fedraheim'' in 1877, in which he urged reforms in many spheres including political, social, religious, agrarian, and linguistic. He was married to [[Hulda Garborg]].

He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] six times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=3323 |title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Garborg grew up on a farm named Garborg, near [[Undheim]], in [[Time, Norway|Time]] municipality at [[Jæren]] in [[Rogaland]] county. He grew up together with eight siblings. Although he was to become known as an author, it was as a newspaperman that he got his start. In 1872 he established the newspaper [[Tvedestrandsposten]], and in 1877 the [[Fedraheimen]], which he served as managing editor until 1892.&lt;ref&gt;His friend [[Ivar Mortensson-Egnund]] edited the paper “Fedraheimen” from 1883 until 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1880s he was also a journalist for the [[Dagbladet]].  In 1894 he laid the ground, together with [[Rasmus Steinsvik]], for the paper ''Den 17de Mai'';&lt;ref name="independenceday"&gt;Norway's independence day.&lt;/ref&gt; which changed its name to [[Norsk Tidend]] in 1935.

His novels are profound and gripping while his essays are clear and insightful. He was never inclined to steer clear of controversy. His work tackled the issues of the day, including the relevance of religion in modern times, the conflicts between national and European identity, and the ability of the common people to actually participate in political processes and decisions.

In 2012 the [[Garborg Centre]] opened at [[Bryne]], Time. It is dedicated to the literature and philosophy of Arne and his wife, Hulda. Several of their homes are now turned into museums, like [[Garborgheimen]], [[Labråten]], [[Kolbotn]] and [[Knudaheio]].

&lt;!-- Garborg viklet seg en tid inn i [[sedelighetsdebatten]], blant annet gjennom sine mange skriverier i [[Dagbladet]], og hans roman ''Mannfolk'' (1886) som ble beslaglagt av myndighetene og gjorde at Garborg mistet sin jobb i [[Riksrevisjonen]].  Garborg var særs kritisk til de radikale beskrivelser i [[Henrik Ibsen]]s Gjengangere.  I [[målsaken]] var Garborg i opposisjon til [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]], og mistet antakeligvis muligheten for å bestige redaktørposten i avisa.          --&gt;

      <comment>I had to add the externally recognized name for the Rifi variant of Berber, which is Tarifit. This name is commonly used by all other berbers to design the Rifi variant, sometimes even used by locals themselves to distinguish their dialect from the Tamazight of Central Atlas. I am of Central Atlas Berber origins.</comment>

They comprise a group of closely related dialects spoken by the [[Berbers]], who are indigenous to [[North Africa]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hayward, Richard J., chapter ''Afroasiatic'' in Heine, Bernd &amp; Nurse, Derek, editors, ''African Languages: An Introduction'' Cambridge 2000. {{ISBN|0-521-66629-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The languages were traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script, which now exists in the form of [[Tifinagh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=L. Cabot|title=A Review of the Physical Anthropology of the Sahara and Its Prehistoric Implications|journal=Man|volume=56|pages=20–23|date=February 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berber is spoken by large populations of [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]] and [[Libya]], by smaller populations of [[Tunisia]], northern [[Mali]], western and northern [[Niger]], northern [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mauritania]] and in the [[Siwa Oasis]] of [[Egypt]]. Large Berber-speaking migrant communities, today numbering about 4 million, have been living in Western Europe, spanning over three generations, since the 1950s. The number of Berber people is much higher than the number of Berber speakers. The bulk of the populations of the [[Maghreb]] countries are considered to have Berber ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3509799.stm|title=BBC NEWS. Q&amp;A: The Berbers|date=2004-03-12|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 90% of the Berber-speaking population speak one of seven major varieties of Berber, each with at least 2 million speakers. They are, in order of number of speakers: [[Shilha language|Shilha]] (''Tacelḥit/Tasussit''), [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]] (''Taqbaylit''), [[Central Atlas Tamazight]] (''Tamaziɣt''), [[Riffian language|Riffian]] (internal:''Tmaziɣt, external:Tarifit''), [[Shawiya language|Shawiya]] (''Tacawit'') and [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]] (''Tamaceq/Tamajaq/Tamahaq''). The extinct [[Guanche language]] spoken on the [[Canary Islands]] by the [[Guanches]] as well as the languages of the ancient [[C-Group culture]] in present-day southern Egypt and northern [[Sudan]] are believed to have belonged to the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic family.

The Berber languages and dialects have had a written tradition, on and off, for about 2,500 years, although the tradition has been frequently disrupted by cultural shifts and invasions. They were first written in the Libyco-Berber [[abjad]], which is still used today by the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] in the form of Tifinagh. The oldest dated inscription is from 3rd century BCE. Later, between about 1000 CE and 1500 CE, they were written in the [[Arabic script]], and since the 20th century they have been written in the [[Berber Latin alphabet]], especially among the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] and [[Riffian people|Riffian]] communities of Morocco and Algeria. The Berber Latin alphabet was also used by most European and Berber linguists during the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrederechercheberbere.fr/la-langue-berbere.html|title=Centre de Recherche Berbère - La Langue Berbère|website=www.centrederechercheberbere.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modernised form of the Tifinagh alphabet, called [[Neo-Tifinagh]], was adopted in Morocco in 2003 for writing Berber, but many Moroccan Berber publications still use the Berber Latin alphabet. Algerians mostly use the Berber Latin alphabet in Berber-language education at public schools, while Tifinagh is mostly used for artistic symbolism. Mali and Niger recognise a Tuareg Berber Latin alphabet customised to the Tuareg phonological system. However, traditional Tifinagh is still used in those countries.

There is a cultural and political movement among speakers of the closely related varieties of Northern Berber to promote and unify them under a written [[standard language]] called ''Tamaziɣt'' (or ''Tamazight''). The name ''Tamaziɣt'' is the current native name of the Berber language in the Moroccan [[Middle Atlas]] and [[Rif]] regions and the Libyan [[Zuwarah]] region. In other Berber-speaking areas, this name was lost. There is historical evidence from medieval Berber manuscripts that all indigenous North Africans from Libya to Morocco have at some point called their language ''Tamaziɣt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/1268712/Some_grammatical_features_of_Ancient_Eastern_Berber_the_language_of_the_Mudawwana_|title=Some grammatical features of Ancient Eastern Berber (the language of the Mudawwana)|first=Vermondo|last=Brugnatelli|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemorocco.com/tamkardit-library/Grammatical_features_of_Eastern_Berber.pdf |format=PDF|title=Some grammatical features of ancient Eastern Berber |first= Vermondo |last=Brugnatelli|year= 2011|website=www.freemorocco.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Muhammad_Awzal_and_the_Berber_Literary_T.html?id=tsn7jwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Muhammad Awzal and the Berber Literary Tradition of the Sous|first=Nico Van den|last=Boogert|date=22 August 1995|publisher=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Tamaziɣt'' is currently being used increasingly by educated Berbers to refer to the written Berber language, and even to Berber as a whole, including Tuareg.

In 2001, Berber became a constitutional [[national language]] of Algeria, and in 2011 Berber became a constitutionally [[official language]] of Morocco. In 2016, Berber became a constitutionally official language of Algeria alongside [[Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-35515769|title=Algeria reinstates term limit and recognises Berber language|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Tamazightchelha.ogg|thumb|right|180x180px|Speech sample in [[Shilha language|Shilha]] (Chelha).]]
The term ''Berber'' has been used in Europe since at least the 17th century and is still used today. It was borrowed from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:barbari#Noun 3|barbari]]''. The Latin word is also found in the Arabic designation for these populations, البربر (''al-Barbar''); see [[Names of the Berber people]].

Etymologically, the Berber root ''M-Z-Ɣ'' (''Mazigh'') (singular noun: ''Amazigh'', feminine: ''Tamazight'') means "free man", "noble man", or "defender". The feminine ''Tamazight'' traditionally referred specifically to the [[Riffian language|Riffian]] and [[Central Atlas Tamazight]] languages. Many Berber linguists prefer to consider the term ''Tamazight'' as a pure Berber word to be used only in Berber text while using the European word "Berber/''Berbero''/''Berbère''" in European texts to follow the traditions of European writings about the Berbers. European languages distinguish between the words "Berber" and "[[Barbarian#Berber and North African cultures|barbarian]]", while Arabic has the same word ''al-Barbari'' for both meanings.

Some other Berber writers, especially in Morocco, prefer to refer to Berber with ''Amazigh'' when writing about it in French or English.

Traditionally, the term ''Tamazight'' (in various forms: ''Thamazighth'', ''Tamasheq'', ''Tamajaq'', ''Tamahaq'') was used by many Berber groups to refer to the language they spoke, including the [[Central Atlas Tamazight|Middle Atlas]], the [[Riffian people|Riffians]], the [[Sened language|Sened]] in Tunisia and the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]. However, other terms were used by other groups; for instance, some Berber populations of Algeria called their language ''Taznatit'' ([[Zenata|Zenati]]) or ''Shelha'', while the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]]s called theirs ''Taqbaylit'', and the inhabitants of the [[Siwa Oasis]] called their language ''Siwi''. In Tunisia, the local Amazigh language is usually referred to as ''Shelha'', a term which has been observed in Morocco as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosettaproject.org/live/search/showpages?ethnocode%3DZEN%26doctype%3Ddetail%26version%3D0%26scale%3Dsix |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 28, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927144458/http://www.rosettaproject.org/live/search/showpages?ethnocode=ZEN&amp;doctype=detail&amp;version=0&amp;scale=six |archivedate=September 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One group, the [[Linguasphere Observatory]], has attempted to introduce the [[neologism]] "Tamazic languages" to refer to the Berber languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linguasphere.info/lcontao/tl_files/pdf/master/OL-SITE%201999-2000%20MASTER%20ONE%20Sectors%201-Intro.pdf  ''Afro-Asian Phylosector''] linguasphere.info.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
{{main article|Proto-Berber language}}
Berber is a branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Christopher Ehret; Bernd Heine, Derek Nurse (ed.)|title=African Languages: An Introduction|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521666295|page=290|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=C7XhcYoFxaQC&amp;pg=PA290|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since modern Berber languages are relatively homogeneous, the date of the [[Proto-Berber language]] from which the modern group is derived was probably comparatively recent, comparable to the age of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] or [[Romance languages|Romance]] subfamilies. In contrast, the split of the group from the other Afroasiatic sub-phyla is much earlier, and is therefore sometimes associated with the local Mesolithic [[Capsian culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/equipes/index.asp?Action=Edit&amp;Langue=EN&amp;Equipe=3%20%20&amp;Page=Action&amp;ActionNum=26 |title=DDL : Evolution - Themes and actions |publisher=Ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr |date= |accessdate=2015-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of extinct populations are believed to have spoken Afroasiatic languages of the Berber branch. According to Peter Behrens (1981) and Marianne Bechaus-Gerst (2000), linguistic evidence suggests that the peoples of the [[C-Group culture]] in present-day southern [[Egypt]] and northern [[Sudan]] spoke Berber languages.&lt;ref name="Bechaus-Gerst"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marianne Bechaus-Gerst|first1=Roger Blench, Kevin MacDonald (ed.)|title=The Origins and Development of African Livestock: Archaeology, Genetics, Linguistics and Ethnography – "Linguistic evidence for the prehistory of livestock in Sudan" (2000)|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1135434166|pages=453–457|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=-t5QAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lbant"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Behrens|first1=Peter|title=Libya Antiqua: Report and Papers of the Symposium Organized by Unesco in Paris, 16 to 18 January 1984 – "Language and migrations of the early Saharan cattle herders: the formation of the Berber branch"|date=1986|publisher=Unesco|isbn=9231023764|page=30|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=p_hwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] [[Nobiin language]] today contains a number of key pastoralism related [[loanword]]s that are of Berber origin, including the terms for sheep and water/[[Nile]]. This in turn suggests that the C-Group population — which, along with the [[Kerma Culture|Kerma culture]], inhabited the Nile valley immediately before the arrival of the first [[Nubian languages|Nubian]] speakers — spoke Afro-Asiatic languages.&lt;ref name="Bechaus-Gerst"/&gt;

[[Roger Blench]] (2018)&lt;ref name="Blench2018"&gt;Blench, Roger. 2018. [https://www.academia.edu/36664366/Reconciling_archaeological_and_linguistic_evidence_for_Berber_prehistory Reconciling archaeological and linguistic evidence for Berber prehistory].&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that Proto-Berber speakers had spread from the Nile River valley to North Africa 4,000-5,000 years ago due to the spread of pastoralism, and experienced intense language leveling about 2,000 years ago as the [[Roman Empire]] was expanding in North Africa. Hence, although Berber had split off from Afroasiatic several thousand years ago, Proto-Berber itself can only be reconstructed to a period as late as 200 A.D. Blench (2018) notes that Berber is considerably different from other Afroasiatic branches, but modern-day Berber languages display low internal diversity. The presence of [[Punic language|Punic]] borrowings in Proto-Berber points to the diversification of modern Berber language varieties subsequent to the fall of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] in 146 B.C.; only [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] lacks Punic loanwords.&lt;ref name="Blench2018"/&gt; Additionally, [[Latin language|Latin]] loanwords in Proto-Berber point to the breakup of Proto-Berber between 0-200 A.D. During this time period, Roman innovations including the ox-plough, camel, and orchard management were adopted by Berber communities along the ''[[limes]]'', or borders of the Roman Empire. This resulted in a new trading culture involving the use of a [[lingua franca]] which became Proto-Berber.&lt;ref name="Blench2018"/&gt;

==Orthography==
{{Main article|Berber orthography}}
[[File:Prehistory-draa16.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[Tifinagh|Libyco-Berber]] inscriptions in [[Zagora, Morocco|Zagora]], Morocco]]
Various orthographies have been used to transcribe the Berber languages. In antiquity, the Libyco-Berber script ([[Tifinagh]]) was utilised to write Berber. Early uses of the script have been found on [[rock art]] and in various [[sepulchre]]s. Among these are the 1,500 year old [[Tin Hinan Tomb|monumental tomb]] of the Tuareg matriarch [[Tin Hinan]], where vestiges of a Tifinagh inscription have been found on one of its walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=L. Cabot|title=A Review of the Physical Anthropology of the Sahara and Its Prehistoric Implications|journal=Man|date=February 1957|volume=56|pages=20–23|jstor=2793877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the spread of [[Islam]], some Berber scholars also utilised the [[Arabic script]].&lt;ref name="sec14"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ben-Layashi|2007|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now three writing systems in use for Berber languages: Tifinagh, the Arabic script, and the [[Berber Latin alphabet]].&lt;ref name="choice"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Larbi| first = Hsen| title = Which Script for Tamazight, Whose Choice is it ?| journal = Amazigh Voice (Taghect Tamazight)| volume = 12| issue = 2| year = 2003| publisher = Amazigh Cultural Association in America (ACAA)| location = New Jersey| url = http://www.tamazgha.fr/Which-Script-for-Tamazight-Whose-Choice-is-it,359.html| accessdate = December 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
After independence, all the [[Maghreb]] countries to varying degrees pursued a policy of [[Arabization|Arabisation]], aimed partly at displacing French from its colonial position as the dominant language of education and literacy. Under this policy the use of the Amazigh/Berber languages was suppressed or even banned. This state of affairs has been contested by Berbers in Morocco and Algeria—especially [[Kabylie]]—and was addressed in both countries by affording the language official status and introducing it in some schools.

The 2011 constitution of Morocco makes "Amazigh" an official language alongside Arabic. Morocco is a country with several competing linguistically different languages, including French, [[Modern Standard Arabic]], [[Moroccan Darija|Moroccan Arabic]] and Amazigh. As the higher status of Modern Standard Arabic grew, so did the relation between the male population and the language, as well as the female population and the lower status language Amazigh. Women became the main carriers of the Amazigh language as the lower-status language in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Sadiqi, F. (2007). The Role of Moroccan Women in Preserving Amazigh Language and Culture. Museum International,59(4), 26-33. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-0033.2007.00620.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June 2011 King [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|Mohammed VI]] announced in a speech of new constitutional reform that "Tamazight" became an official language of Morocco alongside Arabic and will be used in all the administrations in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110617/wl_africa_afp/moroccopoliticsunrest |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622061307/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110617/wl_africa_afp/moroccopoliticsunrest |archivedate=June 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 April 2012 Fatima Chahou, alias ''Tabaamrant'', member of the [[House of Representatives (Morocco)|Moroccan House of Representatives]] and former singer became the first person to [[Question time|ask questions]] and discuss the minister's answer in Tamazight inside the [[Parliament of Morocco]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Algeria recognized Berber as a "[[national language]]" in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} – [http://www.apn-dz.org/apn/french/constitution96/loi02_03.htm « Loi n° 02-03 portent révision constitutionnelle »], adopted on April 10, 2002, allotting in particular to "Tamazight" the status of national language.&lt;/ref&gt; though not as an [[official language|official]] one. However, on 7 February 2016 the Algerian parliament recognised Berber languages as having official status along with Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aps.dz/images/doc/PROJET-DE%20REVISION-DE-LA-CONSTITUTION-28-DECEMBRE-2015.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522160159/http://www.aps.dz/images/doc/PROJET-DE%20REVISION-DE-LA-CONSTITUTION-28-DECEMBRE-2015.pdf |archivedate=2016-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-35515769|title=Algeria reinstates term limit and recognises Berber language|date=7 February 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although regional councils in Libya's [[Nafusa Mountains]] affiliated with the [[National Transitional Council]] reportedly use the Berber language of [[Nafusi language|Nafusi]] and have called for it to be granted co-official status with Arabic in a prospective new constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/26/libya-berber-idUKLDE74O19G20110526|agency=Reuters|date=26 May 2011|title=Libya's mountain Berber see opportunity in war|accessdate=5 July 2011|first=Matt|last=Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/world/africa/09berbers.html|date=8 August 2011|title=Amid a Berber Reawakening in Libya, Fears of Revenge|accessdate=10 August 2011|first=C.J.|last=Chivers|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not have official status in Libya as in Morocco and Algeria. As areas of Libya south and west of [[Tripoli]] such as the Nafusa Mountains were taken from the control of [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi]] government forces in early summer 2011, Berber workshops and exhibitions sprang up to share and spread the Tamazight culture and language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14026216 Waiting game for rebels in western Libya], BBC News, John Simpson, 5 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mali and Niger, there are a few schools that teach partially in [[Tuareg languages]].

== Population ==
&lt;!-- NOTE: this section is intended only for estimates backed up by a referenced academic or academic organization. Many sites (eg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyamazigh.org/|title=Libya Mazigh|website=Libya Mazigh}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Libya) make claims about population backed up neither by data nor by academic reputation. --&gt;

The exact population of Berber speakers is hard to ascertain, since most North African countries do not record language data in their censuses. [[Ethnologue]] provides a useful academic starting point; however, its bibliographic references are very inadequate, and it rates its own accuracy at only B-C for the area. Early colonial censuses may provide better documented figures for some countries; however, these are also very much out of date.

: ''Few census figures are available; all countries (Algeria and Morocco included) do not count Berber languages. The 1972 Niger census reported Tuareg, with other languages, at 127,000 speakers. Population shifts in location and number, effects of urbanization and education in other languages, etc., make estimates difficult. In 1952, André Basset (LLB.4) estimated the number of Berberophones at 5,500,000. Between 1968 and 1978 estimates ranged from eight to thirteen million (as reported by Galand, LELB 56, pp. 107, 123–25); Voegelin and Voegelin (1977, p. 297) call eight million a conservative estimate. In 2006, [[Salem Chaker]] estimated that the Berberophone populations of Kabylie and the three Moroccan groups numbered more than one million each; and that in Algeria, 9,650,000, or one out of five Algerians, speak a Berber language (Chaker 1984, pp. 8–9).''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isp.msu.edu/AfrLang/Berber-root.html |title=African Languages at Michigan State University (ASC) &amp;#124; Michigan State University |publisher=Isp.msu.edu |date=2010-10-08 |accessdate=2013-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420050102/http://www.isp.msu.edu/afrlang/Berber-root.html |archivedate=April 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berber dialects in Morocco.PNG|thumb|250px|right|Map of Berber-speaking areas in Morocco]]
* '''Morocco''': In 1952, André Basset ("La langue berbère", ''Handbook of African Languages'', Part I, Oxford) estimated that a "small majority" of Morocco's population spoke Berber. The 1960 census claimed that 34 percent of Moroccans spoke Berber, including bi-, tri- and quadrilingual people.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} In 2000, [[Karl Prasse]] cited "more than a third" in an interview conducted by Brahim Karada at Tawalt.com.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} A 2007 estimate put the number of Amazigh speakers in Morocco at 7.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Diversity Endangered|last=Brenzinger|first=Matthias|publisher=Walter de Gruyter.|year=2007|isbn=978-3-11-017049-8|location=Berlin, Germany|pages=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ethnologue]] (by deduction from its Moroccan Arabic figures), the Berber-speaking population should be estimated at 35 percent or around 10.5 million speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/14/show_country.asp?name%3DMorocco |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119004808/http://www.ethnologue.com/14/show_country.asp?name=Morocco |archivedate=November 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the figures it gives for individual languages only add up to 7.5 million, divided into three languages:
** [[Riffian language|Riffian]]: 3 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrederechercheberbere.fr/rifain.html |title=Inalco Crb |publisher=Centrederechercheberbere.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Shilha language|Shilha]]: 8 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrederechercheberbere.fr/chleuh.html |title=Inalco Crb |publisher=Centrederechercheberbere.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey included in the official [[2004 Moroccan census|Moroccan census of 2004]] and published by several Moroccan newspapers gave the following figures: 34 percent of people in rural regions spoke a Berber language and 21 percent in urban zones did; the national average would be 28.4 percent or 8.52 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bladi.net/marocain-berbere.html |title=Bladi.net |publisher=Bladi.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible, however, that the survey asked for the language "used in daily life",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfieljadida2009.blogvie.com/2008/12/11/les-derniers-chiffres-du-recensement-28-de-la-population-parlent-une-langue-amazighe/ |title=Al Bayane Newspaper, 10/07/2005 |publisher=Cfieljadida2009.blogvie.com |date=2005-10-07 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would result in figures lower than those of native speakers, as the language is not recognised for official purposes and many Berbers who live in an Arabic-speaking environment cannot use it in daily life; also, the use of Berber in public was frowned upon until the 1990s, which may have affected the result of the survey.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Adding up the population (according to the official census of 2004) of the Berber-speaking regions as shown on a 1973 map from the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] results in at least 10 million speakers, not counting the numerous Berber population which lives outside these regions in the bigger cities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Moroccan linguist [[Mohamed Chafik]] claims that 80 percent of [[Demographics of Morocco|Moroccans]] are Berbers. It is not clear, however, whether he means "speakers of Berber languages" or "people of Berber descent".

The division of Moroccan Berber languages into three groups, as used by Ethnologue, is common in linguistic publications, but is significantly complicated by the presence of local differences: Shilha is subdivided into Shilha of the [[Draa River]] valley, Tasusit (the language of the [[Sous]]s) and several other mountain languages. Moreover, linguistic boundaries are blurred, such that certain languages cannot accurately be described as either Central Morocco Tamazight (spoken in the central and eastern [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]] area) or Shilha.
* '''Algeria''': In 1906, the total population speaking Berber languages in Algeria (excluding the thinly populated Sahara region) was estimated at 1,305,730 out of 4,447,149, i.e. 29 percent. [[File:Aires linguistiques du nord-est algérien.svg|180px|thumb| [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]] and [[Shawiya language|Shawiya]] languages in the central-eastern part of Algeria]](Doutté &amp; Gautier, ''Enquête sur la dispersion de la langue berbère en Algérie, faite par l'ordre de M. le Gouverneur Général'', Alger 1913.) The 1911 census, however, found 1,084,702 speakers out of 4,740,526, i.e. 23 percent; Doutté &amp; Gautier suggest that this was the result of a serious undercounting of [[Shawiya language|Shawiya]] in areas of widespread [[bilingualism]]. A trend was noted for Berber groups surrounded by Arabic (as in the city of [[Blida]]) to adopt Arabic, while Arabic speakers surrounded by Berber (as in Sikh ou Meddour near the city of [[Tizi Ouzou]]) tended to adopt Berber. In 1952, André Basset estimated that about a third of Algeria's population spoke Berber. According to historian Charles-Robert Ageron in 1886, Algeria had around 1.2 million Berber speakers and 1.1 million Arab speakers. The Algerian census of 1966 found 2,297,997 out of 12,096,347 Algerians, or 19 percent, to speak "Berber". In 1980, Salem Chaker estimated that "in Algeria, 3,650,000, or one out of five Algerians, speak a Berber language" (Chaker 1984, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9). According to Ethnologue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ethnologue |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=DZ |title=Algeria |publisher=Ethnologue |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; more recent estimates include 14 percent (corresponding to the total figures it gives for each Berber language added together, 4 million) and (by deduction from its Algerian Arabic figures) 29 percent (Hunter 1996). Most of these are accounted for by three languages (percentages based on historical population data from appropriate dates):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populstat.info/Africa/algeriac.htm |title=ALGERIA: population growth of the whole country |publisher=Populstat.info |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Berbères en Algérie occidentale.svg|180px|thumb| [[Shenwa language]] in the central-western part of Algeria]]
:* [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]]: 2,540,000 or 9 percent (Ethnologue, 1995); 6,000,000 or 20 percent (Ethnologue, 1998). Mainly in [[Algiers]], [[Béjaïa]], [[Tizi Ouzou]], [[Bouïra]], [[Sétif]] and [[Boumerdès]].
:* [[Shawiya language|Shawiya]]: ~2 million or 8.5 percent of the population as of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrederechercheberbere.fr/chaouia.html |title=Centre de Recherche Berbère - Chaouia |publisher=Centrederechercheberbere.fr |date= |accessdate=2015-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainly in [[Batna, Algeria|Batna]], [[Khenchela]], Sétif, [[Souk Ahras]], [[Oum El Bouaghi]] and [[Tébessa]].
:* [[Shenwa language|Shenwa]]: 56,300 speakers according to an estimate, in the [[Dahra Range]] region, more precisely [[Mount Chenoua]], just west of Algiers in the [[Provinces of Algeria|provinces]] of [[Tipaza Province|Tipaza]], [[Chlef Province|Chlef]] and [[Aïn Defla Province|Aïn Defla]]. Two main languages: Beni Menacer, west and south of the Mount Chenoua area and in the Mount Chenoua area, with 55,250 speakers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

: A fourth group, despite a very small population, accounts for most of the land area where Berber is spoken:
:* [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]: 25,000 in Algeria (Ethnologue, 1987), mainly in the [[Hoggar Mountains]] of the Sahara. Most Tuareg live in Mali and Niger (see below). &lt;!-- It is however not clear if those numbers actually include the Berber speakers of [[Tlemcen]] and [[Blida]] provinces. --&gt;

Other Berber languages spoken in Algeria include: the Tamazight of [[Blida]], the languages of the [[Beni Snous]]s and [[Beni Boussaid]] villages in the province of [[Tlemcen Province|Tlemcen]], the [[Matmata Berber]] spoken in the [[Ouarsenis]] region, the [[Mozabite language]] spoken in the region of the province of Mzab and the language of the [[Ouargla]] oasis.
* '''Tunisia''': Basset (1952) estimated about 1 percent, as did Penchoen (1968). According to Ethnologue, there are only 26,000 speakers (1998) of a Berber language it calls "[[Jerba Berber|Djerbi]]", but which Tunisians call "Shelha", in Tunisia, all in the south around [[Djerba]] and [[Matmata, Tunisia|Matmata]]. The more northerly enclave of [[Sened (town)|Sened]] no longer speaks Berber. This would make 0.3 percent of the population.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Chenini is also one of the rare remaining berber-speaking villages in Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDq4YV0VT00C&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=Berber-speaking+migrant+communities&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j8wdG-qGd8&amp;sig=v7AtlO7tCrPlVVHE8UDqmJT2seI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwioueuvlffUAhXGVj4KHe7VDi84ChDoAQgsMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Berber-speaking%20migrant%20communities&amp;f=false|title=Change in Tunisia: Studies in the Social Sciences|last=Stone|first=Russell A.|last2=Simmons|first2=John|date=1976|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780873953115|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Libya''': According to Ethnologue (by deduction from its combined Libyan Arabic and Egyptian Arabic figures) the non-Arabic-speaking population, most of which would be Berber, is estimated at 4 percent (1991, 1996). However, the individual language figures it gives add up to 162,000, i.e. about 3 percent. This is mostly accounted for by the languages:
** [[Nafusi language|Nafusi]] in the [[Nafusa Mountains]] and [[Zuwara Berber]] in the city of [[Zuwarah]] in the [[Tripolitania]] region: 184,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

** [[Tamahaq language|Tahaggart (Tamahaq) language]] of the [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg branch]] of the town of [[Ghat, Libya|Ghat]]: 17,000 (Johnstone 1993).
* '''Egypt''': The oasis of [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] near the Libyan border speaks a Berber language; according to Ethnologue, there are 5,000 speakers there (1995). Its population in 1907 was 3,884 (according to the 1911 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'').
* '''Mauritania''': According to Ethnologue, only 200 to 300 speakers of [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] remain (1998). It also mentions [[Tamasheq]], but does not provide a population figure for it. Most non-Arabic speakers in Mauritania speak [[Niger–Congo languages]].
* '''Mali''': Ethnologue counts 440,000 [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] (1991) speaking:
:: [[Tamasheq]]: 250,000
:: [[Tawallammat Tamajaq language|Tamajaq]]: 190,000
* '''Niger''': Ethnologue counts 720,000 [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] (1998) speaking:
:: [[Tawallamat Tamajaq]]: 450,000
:: [[Tayart Tamajeq]]: 250,000
:: [[Tamahaq language|Tamahaq]]: 20,000
* '''Burkina Faso''': Ethnologue counts 20,000 to 30,000 [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] ([[SIL International]] 1991), speaking [[Kel Tamasheq]]. However Ethnologue is very inaccurate here, appearing to miss the largest group of Tamasheq in Burkina in the province of [[Oudalan Province|Oudalan]]. The Tamasheq-speaking population of Burkina is nearer to 100,000 (2005), with around 70,000 Tamasheq speakers in the province of Oudalan, the rest mainly in Seno, Soum, Yagha, Yatenga and Kadiogo provinces. About 10 percent of Burkina Tamasheq speak a version of the Tawallamat language.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}
* '''Nigeria''': Ethnologue notes the presence of a "few" [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], speaking [[Tawallamat Tamajaq]].
* '''France''': Ethnologue lists 860,000 speakers for Riffian and 537,000 speakers for Kabyle and 400,000 for [[Shilha language|Shilha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrederechercheberbere.fr/chleuh.html|title=Centre de Recherche Berbère - Chleuh|website=www.centrederechercheberbere.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 150,000 for [[Central Morocco Tamazight]] . For the rest of Europe, it has no figures.
* '''Spain''': Tamazight is spoken amongst [[Melilla]]'s 80,000 inhabitants, but there has been no census as to the percentage of its speakers. A minority of [[Ceuta]]'s inhabitants speak Berber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/document/berber/an/i1/i1.html#1 |title=Euromosaic -Berber (Tamazight) in Spain |publisher=Uoc.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Israel''': Around two thousand mostly elderly Moroccan-born Israelis of [[Berber Jews|Berber Jewish]] descent use [[Judeo-Berber]] languages (as opposed to [[Moroccan Jews]] who trace descent from Spanish-speaking [[Sephardi Jews]] [[Alhambra decree|expelled from Spain]], or Arabic-speaking Moroccan Jews).

Thus, the total number of speakers of Berber languages in the [[Maghreb]] proper appears to lie anywhere between 16 and 25 million, depending on which estimate is accepted; if we take Basset's estimate, it could be as high as 30 million. The vast majority are concentrated in Morocco and Algeria. The Tuareg of the [[Sahel]] adds another million or so to the total.

==Grammar==
[[File:Qanun At Ali u Herzun.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Kabylian]] manuscript from the 18th century]]

===Nouns===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
[[Noun]]s in the Berber languages vary in [[Grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine versus feminine), [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular versus plural) and [[Grammatical state|state]] (free state versus [[construct state]]). In the case of the masculine, nouns generally begin with one of the three vowels of Berber, ''a'', ''u'' or ''i'' (in standardised orthography, ''e'' represents a [[schwa]] {{IPA|[ə]}} inserted for reasons of pronunciation):
::afus "hand"
::argaz "man"
::udem "face"
::ul "heart"
::ixef "head"
::iles "tongue"

While the masculine is unmarked, the feminine (also used to form [[diminutive]]s and [[singulative]]s, like an ear of wheat) is marked with the [[circumfix]] ''t...t''. Feminine plural takes a prefix ''t...'':
::afus → tafust
::udem → tudemt
::ixef → tixeft
::ifassen → tifassin

Berber languages have two types of [[Grammatical number|number]]: singular and [[plural]], of which only the latter is marked. Plural has three forms according to the type of nouns. The first, "regular" type is known as the "external plural"; it consists in changing the initial vowel of the noun, and adding a [[suffix]] ''-n'':
::afus → ifassen "hands"
::argaz → irgazen "men"
::ixef → ixfawen "heads"
::ul → ulawen "hearts"
The second form of the plural is known as the "broken plural". It involves only a change in the vowels of the word:
::adrar → idurar "mountain"
::agadir → igudar "wall / castle"
::abaghus → ibughas "monkey"
The third type of plural is a mixed form: it combines a change of vowels with the suffix ''-n'':&lt;!--Sorry I can't see the difference with the first type! --&gt;
::izi → izan "(the) fly"
::azur → izuran "roof"
::iziker → izakaren "rope"

Berber languages also have two types of states or [[grammatical case|cases]] of the [[noun]], organized [[Ergative case|ergatively]]: one is unmarked, while the other serves for the subject of a transitive verb and the object of a preposition, among other contexts. The former is often called ''free state'', the latter ''construct state''. The construct state of the noun derives from the free state through one of the following rules:
The first involves a vowel alternation, whereby the vowel ''a'' becomes ''u'':
::argaz → urgaz
::amghar → umghar
::adrar → udrar
The second involves the loss of the initial vowel, in the case of some feminine nouns:
::tamghart → temghart "woman / mature woman"
::tamdint → temdint "town"
::tarbat → terbat "girl"
The third involves the addition of a semi-vowel (''w'' or ''y'') word-initially:
::asif → '''w'''asif "river"
::aḍu → '''w'''aḍu "wind"
::iles → '''y'''iles "tongue"
::uccen → '''w'''uccen "wolf"
Finally, some nouns do not change for free state:
::taddart → taddart "house / village"
::tuccent → tuccent "female wolf"

The following table gives the forms for the noun ''amghar'' "old man / leader":

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
| colspan="2" | masculine
| colspan="2" | feminine
|-
| || default || agent || default || agent
|-
| singular || ''amghar'' || ''umghar'' || ''tamghart'' || ''temghart''
|-
| plural || ''imgharen'' || ''yimgharen'' || ''timgharin'' || ''temgharin''
|}

===Pronouns===
Berber pronouns show gender distinction in the second- and third-persons, but in verbal agreement markers, the distinction is lost in the second-person.&lt;ref&gt;Bhat, D.N.S. 2004. ''Pronouns.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subclassification==
[[Image:Berber-map.png|450px|thumb|Modern Berber branches:{{col-begin|width=100%}}{{col-break|width=50%}}[[Western Berber languages|Western Berber]]:{{legend|#408E6E|[[Zenaga language]]}}[[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]]:{{legend|#35FE9C|[[Atlas languages]]}}

]]
A listing of the other Berber languages is complicated by their closeness; there is little distinction between language and dialect. The primary difficulty of subclassification, however, lies in the eastern Berber languages, where there is little agreement. Otherwise there is consensus on the outlines of the family:
* [[Eastern Berber languages|Eastern Berber]] (scope debated)
* [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]]
** [[Zenati languages|Zenati]] (incl. Riffian and Shawiya)
** [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]]
** [[Atlas languages|Atlas]] (incl. Shilha and Central Atlas Tamazight)
* [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]]
* [[Western Berber languages|Western Berber]] ([[Zenaga language|Zenaga]])

The various classifications differ primarily in what they consider to be Eastern Berber, and in how many varieties they recognise as distinct languages.

There is so little data available on [[Guanche language|Guanche]] that any classification is necessarily uncertain; however, it is almost universally acknowledged as Afro-Asiatic on the basis of the surviving glosses, and widely suspected to be Berber. Much the same can be said of the language, sometimes called "[[Numidian language|Numidian]]", used in the Libyan or Libyco-Berber inscriptions around the turn of the Common Era, whose alphabet is the ancestor of [[Tifinagh]].

===Kossmann (1999)===
[[Maarten Kossmann]] (1999) describes Berber as two [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]],
* [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]] and
* [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]]
plus a few peripheral languages, spoken in isolated pockets largely surrounded by Arabic, that fall outside these continua, namely
* [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] and
* [[Eastern Berber languages|the Libyan and Egyptian varieties]].
Within Northern Berber, however, he recognises a break in the continuum between [[Zenati languages|Zenati]] and their non-Zenati neighbours; and in the east, he recognises a division between [[Ghadamès language|Ghadamès]] and [[Awjila language|Awjila]] on the one hand and [[Sokna language|Sokna]] ([[Fuqaha, Libya]]), [[Siwa language|Siwa]] and [[Nafusi language|Djebel Nefusa]] on the other. The implied tree is:
* [[Nafusi language|Nafusi]]–[[Siwa language|Siwi]] (including Sokna)
* [[Ghadamès language|Ghadamès]]–[[Awjila language|Awjila]]
* [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]]
** [[Zenati languages|Zenati]]
** [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]] and [[Atlas languages|Atlas]]
* [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]]
* [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]]

===''Ethnologue''===
[[Ethnologue]], mostly following [[Alexandra Aikhenvald|Aikhenvald]] and [[Alexander Militarev|Militarev]] (1991), treats the eastern varieties differently:
* [[Guanche language|Guanche]]
* [[Eastern Berber languages|Eastern Berber]]
** [[Siwa language|Siwa]]
** [[Eastern Berber languages|Eastern Berber]] ("Awjila–Sokna")
* [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]] (including Nafusi and Ghadames within Zenati)
* [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]]
* [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]]

===Blench (2006)===
[[Roger Blench|Blench]] (ms, 2006) has the following classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerblench.info/Language/Afroasiatic/General/AALIST.pdf|format=PDF|title=AA list : Blench|date=2006|publisher=Rogerblench.info|accessdate=2015-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Guanche language|Guanche]]†
* [[East Numidian language|East Numidian]] (Old Libyan)† 
* '''Berber'''

and within Berber,
* [[Eastern Berber languages]]
** [[Siwa language|Siwa]]
** [[Awjila language|Awjila]]
** [[Sokna language|Sokna]]†
** [[Ghadamès language|Ghadames]]
* [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]] (including Nafusi within Zenati)
* [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]]
* [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]]

==Influence on other languages==
The Berber languages have influenced [[Maghrebi Arabic]] languages, such as Moroccan, Algerian and Tunisian Arabic. Their influence is also seen in some languages in West Africa. F. W. H. Migeod pointed to strong resemblances between Berber and [[Hausa language|Hausa]] in such words and phrases as these: Berber: '''obanis'''; Hausa ''obansa'' (his father); Berber: '''a bat'''; Hausa ''ya bata'' (he was lost); Berber: '''eghare'''; Hausa ''ya kirra'' (he called). In addition he notes that the genitive in both languages is formed with '''n''' = "of".&lt;ref&gt;Migeod, F. W. H., ''The Languages of West Africa''. Kegan, Paul, Trench &amp; Trübner, London 1913. pages 232, 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extinct languages==
A number of extinct populations are believed to have spoken Afro-Asiatic languages of the Berber branch. According to Peter Behrens (1981) and Marianne Bechaus-Gerst (2000), linguistic evidence suggests that the peoples of the [[C-Group culture]] in present-day southern [[Egypt]] and northern [[Sudan]] spoke Berber languages.&lt;ref name="Bechaus-Gerst"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lbant"/&gt; The [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] [[Nobiin language]] today contains a number of key pastoralism related [[loanword]]s that are of Berber origin, including the terms for sheep and water/[[Nile]]. This in turn suggests that the C-Group population — which, along with the [[Kerma Culture|Kerma culture]], inhabited the Nile valley immediately before the arrival of the first [[Nubian languages|Nubian]] speakers — spoke Afro-Asiatic languages.&lt;ref name="Bechaus-Gerst"/&gt;

Additionally, historical linguistics indicate that the [[Guanche language]], which was spoken on the [[Canary Islands]] by the ancient [[Guanches]], likely belonged to the Berber branch of the Afro-Asiatic family.&lt;ref name="Hawyard"&gt;Richard Hayward, 2000, "Afroasiatic", in Heine &amp; Nurse eds, ''African Languages,'' Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of basic Berber words==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
The Berber letter "'''c'''" is pronounced {{IPA|[ʃ]}} (like the English "'''sh'''").

The Berber letter "'''x'''" is pronounced {{IPA|[χ]}} (like the Spanish "'''j'''" or the German "'''ch'''" (A'''ch'''-Laut)).

The Berber letter "'''ɣ'''" is pronounced {{IPA|[ʁ]}} (like the French or German "'''r'''").

'''Birgid''' (also known as Birked, Birguid, Birkit, Birqed, Kajjara, Murgi, Murgi Birked) is an [[Extinct language|extinct]] [[Nubian language]] that was spoken in western [[Sudan]], north of the city of [[Nyala, Sudan|Nyala]] in [[Darfur]]. Canadian linguist Thelwall mentions his last contact with old speakers of Birgid in 1972.

By way of Early New Persian, Dari Persian, like [[Iranian Persian]] and [[Tajik language|Tajik]], is a continuation of [[Middle Persian]], the official religious and literary language of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian Empire]] (224–651 CE), itself a continuation of [[Old Persian]], the language of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] (550–330 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Lazard, Gilbert 1975, “The Rise of the New Persian Language”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;in Frye, R.&amp;nbsp;N., ''The Cambridge History of Iran'', Vol. 4, pp. 595–632, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In historical usage, ''Dari'' refers to the [[Middle Persian]] court language of the [[Sassanids]].&lt;ref name="EI"&gt;[[Frye, R.&amp;nbsp;N.]], "Darī", ''[[The Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', Brill Publications, CD version&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
Dari is a name given to the [[Persian language#New Persian|New Persian language]] since the 10th century, widely used in [[Arabic]] (compare [[Estakhri|Al-Estakhri]], [[Al-Muqaddasi]], and [[Ibn Hawqal]]) and Persian texts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dari&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1964, it has been the official name in Afghanistan for the Persian spoken there. In Afghanistan, Dari refers to a modern dialect form of Persian that is the ''standard language'' used in administration, government, radio, television, and print media. Because of a preponderance of Dari native speakers, who normally refer to the language as ''Fārsi'' ({{lang|fa|فارسی}}; "Persian"), it is also known as "Afghan Persian" in some Western sources.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www.sil.org"/&gt;

There are different opinions about the origin of the word ''Dari''. The majority of scholars believes that ''Dari'' refers to the Persian word ''dar'' or ''darbār'' ({{wikt-lang|fa|دربار}}), meaning ''"Court"'', as it was the formal language of the [[Sassanid Dynasty|Sassanids]].&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt; The original meaning of the word ''dari'' is given in a notice attributed to [[Abd-Allāh Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ|Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ]] (cited by [[Ibn al-Nadim]] in ''Al-Fehrest'').&lt;ref&gt;Ebn al-Nadim, ed. Tajaddod, p. 15; Khjwārazmī, ''Mafātīh al-olum'', pp. 116–17; Hamza Esfahānī, pp. 67–68; Yāqūt, Boldān IV, p. 846&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, "''Pārsī'' was the language spoken by priests, scholars, and the like; it is the language of [[Fars Province|Fars]]." This language refers to the [[Middle Persian]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; As for ''Dari'', he says, "it is the language of the cities of Madā'en; it is spoken by those who are at the king’s court. [Its name] is connected with presence at court. Among the languages of the people of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and the east, the language of the people of [[Balkh]] is predominant.”&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

The Dari language spoken in Afghanistan is not to be confused with the language of [[Iran]] called [[Dari (Zoroastrian)|Dari]] or Gabri, which is a language of the Central Iranian subgroup spoken in some [[Zoroastrian]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=prd |title="Parsi-Dari" Ethnologue |publisher=Ethnologue.org |date=19 February 1999 |accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=gbz |title="Dari, Zoroastrian" Ethnologue |publisher=Ethnologue.org |date=19 February 1999 |accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: according to the CIA Fact Book, the percentage of Persian/Dari speakers in Afghanistan is 80%. [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2098.html?countryName=Afghanistan&amp;countryCode=af&amp;regionCode=sas&amp;#af 1a]

==History==

Dari comes from [[Middle Persian]] which was spoken during the rule of the [[Sassanid dynasty]]. In general, Iranian languages are known from three periods, usually referred to as Old, Middle, and New (Modern) periods. These correspond to three eras in Iranian history, the old era being the period from some time before, during and after the [[Achaemenid]] period (that is, to 300 BC), the Middle Era being the next period, namely, the Sassanid period and part of the post-Sassanid period, and the New era being the period afterwards down to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farsinet.com/farsi/ |title=Farsi, the most widely spoken Persian Language, a Farsi Dictionary, Farsi English Dictionary, The spoken language in Iran, History of Farsi Language, Learn Farsi, Farsi Translation |publisher=Farsinet.com |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/persian.htm |title=Persian alphabet, pronunciation and language |publisher=Omniglot.com |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iranchamber.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=UCLA, Language Materials Projects |url=http://www.iranchamber.com/literature/articles/persian_language.php |title=Persian Language |publisher=Iranchamber.com |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But it is thought that the first person in Europe to use the term ''Deri'' for ''Dari'' was [[Thomas Hyde]], at Oxford, in his chief work, ''Historia religionis veterum Persarum'' (1700).&lt;ref name="Hyde1760"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Hyde|title=Veterum Persarum et Parthorum et Medorum Religionis Historia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qp5BAAAAcAAJ|accessdate=12 July 2013|year=1760|publisher=E Typographeo Clarendoniano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dari'' or ''Deri'' has two meanings:
* language of the court
: "the Zebani Deri(Zeban i Deri or Zaban i Dari = the language of Deri), or the language of the court, and the Zebani Farsi, the dialect of Persia at large (...)"&lt;ref&gt;John Richardson, London, 1777 pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7hZHFh_nVEMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A vocabulary, Persian, Arabic, and English: abridged from the quarto edition of Richardson's dictionary|author=John Richardson|editor=Sir Charles Wilkins, David Hopkins|year=1810|publisher=Printed for F. and C.

* ''Dari'', sometimes ''Araki''-Methods (Iraqi), is a form of poetry used from [[Rudaki]] to [[Jami]]. In 1500 AD it appeared in Herat in the Persian-speaking [[Timurid dynasty]], and the Persian poems of the Indian poets of the [[Mughal Empire]] who used the ''Indian verse methods'' or ''rhyme methods'' like [[Bedil]] and [[Muhammad Iqbal]], became familiar with the ''Araki'' methods. Iqbal loved both styles of literature and poetry, when he wrote:
{{blockquote|{{nastaliq| گرچہ هندی در عذوبت شکر است|prs}} &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=تمهید|url=http://ganjoor.net/iqbal/asrar-khodi/sh2/|work=Ganjoor|publisher=Ganjoor|accessdate=12 July 2013|language=Persian|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''garcheh [[Hindi]] dar uzūbat&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;u&gt;sh&lt;/u&gt;akkar ast''

{{nastaliq|طرز گفتار دری شیرین تر است|prs}}

''tarz e goftar e Dari &lt;u&gt;sh&lt;/u&gt;irin tar ast''}}

Translation according to literature and poetry:
''Even though in euphonious [[Hindi]]* is sugar''&amp;nbsp;–
''Rhyme method in Dari ([[Persian language|Persian]]) is sweeter *''

''Qandi Parsi'' or ''[Ghand e Parsi]'' ([[Rock candy]] of Parsi'') is a metaphor for the Persian language and poetry.
* Original ''bey Iqbal'': ''Hindi''; [[Hindi]] in [[Devanāgarī|Devanagariscript]]  =  [[Urdu]] in  [[Nastaʿlīq script|Persian-Arabic-script]]
* {{nastaliq|عذب|prs}} is an [[adjective]] of ''uzūbat'' or ''ozubat'' {{nastaliq|عذوبت|prs}} English: {{wikt-lang|en|bliss}} or {{wikt-lang|en|delight}}, {{wikt-lang|en|flavor}} or ''sweetness''; in language, literature and poetry ''uzubat'' means {{wikt-lang|en|euphonious}}, {{wikt-lang|en|melody}} or [[phonaesthetics]].

This poem is a poetic statement of the poet Iqbal with respect to the poetry of the 14th century Persian poet [[Hafez]]:

{{blockquote|{{nastaliq|شکرشکن شوند همه طوطیان هند|prs}}

''Shakkar shekan shavand hameh totiyāneh Hend''

Persian was a major language of government and diplomacy until the middle of the 1700s. Subsequently the strength of Persia declined relative to the industrializing states of Europe (many of whom pursued imperialist policies in the regions where Persian was spoken).

==Table of the important terms of the Persian poets ==
This table gives information how many times the poets of the Persian literature wrote the terms Iran, Turan, Parsi, Farsi, Dari, Khorassan and Pahlevi. It is worth mentioning that many of Nazm ( = Poem نظم) yi Dari or ''Dastan i Dari'' (tale of Dari), Tarz e Guftar e Dari (طرز گفتار دری style of Dari convers) have spoken. Nazm (verse form) and Nassir (نثر = novel, short story etc.) and درامه drama) - the three genres of literature. New Persian literature begins with Poems of [[Rudaki]].

==Geographical distribution==
Dari, which is sometimes called ''Farsi'' (Persian), is one of the two official languages of Afghanistan (the other being [[Pashto language|Pashto]]). In practice though, it serves as the de facto [[lingua franca]] among the various ethno-linguistic groups.

Dari is spoken natively by about twenty-five percent to about eighty percent [[demography of Afghanistan|population of Afghanistan]] as a primary language.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFGHANISTAN v. Languages quote"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/afghanistan-v-languages |title=AFGHANISTAN v.

Moreover, many [[Pashtuns]] living in Tajik and Hazara concentrated areas also use Dari as a first language. The [[World Factbook]] states that eighty percent of the Afghan population speaks the Dari language.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; About 2.5 million [[Afghans in Iran]] and [[Afghans in Pakistan]], part of the wider [[Afghan diaspora]], also speak Dari as one of their primary languages.&lt;ref name="Omniglot.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/dari.htm |title=Dari language, alphabet and pronunciation |publisher=Omniglot.com |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dari dominates the northern, western and central areas of Afghanistan, and is the common language spoken in cities such as [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], [[Herat]], [[Fayzabad, Badakhshan|Fayzabad]], [[Panjshir Province|Panjshir]], [[Bamiyan]], and the Afghan capital of [[Kabul]] where all ethnic groups are settled. Dari-speaking communities also exist in southwestern and eastern Pashtun-dominated areas such as in the cities of [[Ghazni]], [[Farah, Afghanistan|Farah]], [[Zaranj]], [[Lashkar Gah]], [[Kandahar]], and [[Gardez]].

== Cultural influence ==
Dari has contributed to the majority of Persian borrowings in other Asian languages, such as [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], etc., as it was the administrative, official, cultural language of the [[Indo-Persian culture|Persocentric]] [[Mughal Empire]] and served as the [[lingua franca]] throughout the [[South Asian subcontinent]] for centuries. Often based in [[Afghanistan]], Turkic [[Ghaznavids|Central Asian]] conquerors brought the language into South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQJHAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=ghaznavids+brought+persian+to+south+asia&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WSamVIHeGNLiavmygKAL&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ghaznavids%20brought%20persian%20to%20south%20asia&amp;f=false|title=South Asian Sufis: Devotion, Deviation, and Destiny|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basis in general for the introduction of Persian language into the subcontinent was set, from its earliest days, by various Persianized Central Asian Turkic and Afghan dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;Sigfried J. de Laet. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PvlthkbFU1UC&amp;pg=PA734&amp;dq=persian+language+in+anatolia&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMIs-fO2_aRxgIVygYsCh2NJgBM#v=onepage&amp;q=persian%20language%20in%20anatolia&amp;f=false ''History of Humanity: From the seventh to the sixteenth century''] UNESCO, 1994. {{ISBN|9231028138}} p 734&lt;/ref&gt; The sizable Persian component of the Anglo-Indian loan words in English and in [[Urdu]] therefore reflects the Dari pronunciation. For instance, the words [[dopiaza]] and [[pyjama]] come from the Dari pronunciation; in the Iranian Persian they are pronounced ''do-piyāzeh'' and ''pey-jāmeh''. Persian lexemes and certain morphological elements (e.g., the ''ezāfe'') have often been employed to coin words for political and cultural concepts, items, or ideas that were historically unknown outside the South Asian region, as is the case with the aforementioned "borrowings". The Dari language has a rich and colorful tradition of [[proverb]]s that deeply reflect Afghan culture and relationships, as demonstrated by U.S. Navy Captain [[Edward Zellem]] in his bilingual books on Afghan Dari proverbs collected in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Zellem, Edward. 2012. {{cite web|url=http://www.afghanproverbs.com|title=Zarbul Masalha: 151 Afghan Dari Proverbs|publisher=Charleston: CreateSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zellem, Edward. 2012. {{cite web|url=http://www.afghanproverbs.com|title=Afghan Proverbs Illustrated|publisher=Charleston: CreateSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between Iranian and Afghan Persian==
There are phonological, lexical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=prs |title=Ethnologue report for language code: prs |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and morphological&lt;ref name="iranchamber.com"/&gt; differences between Afghan Persian and Iranian Persian. There are no significant differences in the written forms, other than regional idiomatic phrases.

===Phonology===
The principal differences between standard Iranian Persian, based on the dialect of the capital Tehran, and Afghan Persian, as based on the Kabul dialect, are:

# The merging of ''majhul'' vowels {{IPA|/eː, iː/}} and {{IPA|/oː, uː/}} into {{IPA|/iː/}} and {{IPA|/uː/}} respectively in Iranian Persian, whereas in Afghan Persian, they are still kept separate. For instance, the identically written words شیر  'lion' and 'milk' are pronounced the same in Iranian Persian as {{IPA|/ʃiːr/}}, but {{IPA|/ʃeːr/}} for 'lion' and {{IPA|/ʃiːr/}} for 'milk' in Afghan Persian. The long vowel in زود "quick" and زور "strong" is realized as {{IPA|/uː/}} in Iranian Persian, in contrast, these words are pronounced {{IPA|/zuːd/}} and {{IPA|/zoːr/}} respectively by Persian speakers in Afghanistan.
# The treatment of the [[diphthong]]s of early Classical Persian "aw" (as "ow" in Engl. "cow") and "ay" (as "i" in English "ice"), which are pronounced {{IPA|[ow]}} (as in Engl. "low") and {{IPA|[ej]}} (as in English "day") in Iranian Persian. Dari, on the other hand, is more archaic, e.g. نوروز 'Persian New Year' is realized as {{IPA|/nowruːz/}} in Iranian and {{IPA|/nawroːz/}} in Afghan Persian, and نخیر 'no' is {{IPA|/naχejr/}} in Iranian and {{IPA|/naχajr/}} in Afghan Persian. Moreover, {{IPA|[ow]}} is simplified to {{IPA|[o]}} in normal Iranian speech, thereby merging with the short vowel {{IPA|/u/}} (see below). This does not occur in Afghan Persian.
# The high short vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} tend to be lowered in Iranian Persian to {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[o]}}.
# The pronunciation of the labial consonant (و), which is realized as a [[voiced labiodental fricative]] {{IPA|[v]}}, but Afghan Persian still retains the (classical) bilabial pronunciation {{IPA|[w]}}; {{IPA|[v]}} is found in Afghan Persian as an allophone of {{IPA|/f/}} before voiced consonants and as variation of {{IPA|/b/}} in some cases, along with {{IPAblink|β}}.
# The convergence of [[voiced uvular stop]] {{IPA|[ɢ]}} (ق) and [[voiced velar fricative]] {{IPA|[ɣ]}} (غ) in Iranian Persian (presumably under the influence of Turkic languages like [[Azeri language|Azeri]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]]),&lt;ref&gt;A. Pisowicz, ''Origins of the New and Middle Persian phonological systems'' (Cracow 1985), p. 112-114, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; is still kept separate in Dari.
# The realization of short final "a" (ه-) as {{IPA|[e]}} in Iranian Persian.
# The realization of short non-final "a" as {{IPA|[æ]}} in Iranian Persian.
# {{IPA|[a]}} and {{IPA|[e]}} in word-final positions are separate in Dari, {{IPA|[e]}} is a word-final allophone of {{IPA|/æ/}} in Iranian Persian.

===Dialect continuum===
The dialects of Dari spoken in Northern, Central and Eastern Afghanistan, for example in [[Kabul]], [[Mazar-i-Sharif|Mazar]], and [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]], have distinct features compared to [[Farsi|Iranian Persian]]. However, the dialect of Dari spoken in Western Afghanistan stands in between the Afghan and Iranian Persian. For instance, the [[Herat]]i dialect shares vocabulary and phonology with both Dari and Iranian Persian. Likewise, the dialect of Persian in Eastern Iran, for instance in [[Mashhad]], is quite similar to the Herati dialect of Afghanistan.

The Kabuli dialect has become the standard model of Dari in Afghanistan, as has the [[Tehrani accent|Tehrani dialect]] in relation to the Persian in Iran. Since the 1940s, [[Radio Afghanistan]] has broadcast its Dari programs in Kabuli Dari, which ensured the homogenization between the Kabuli version of the language and other dialects of Dari spoken throughout Afghanistan. Since 2003, the media, especially the [[List of television channels in Afghanistan|private radio and television broadcasters]], have carried out their Dari programs using the Kabuli variety.

==Political views on the language==
{{Contradicts other

}}

Successive governments of Afghanistan have promoted New Persian as an [[official language]] of government since the time of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] (1206–1526), even as those governments were dominated by Pashtun people. [[Sher Ali Khan]] of the [[Barakzai dynasty]] (1826–1973) first introduced the [[Pashto language]] as an additional language of administration.  The local name for the Persian variety spoken in Afghanistan was officially changed from Farsi to Dari, meaning "court language", in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[[Willem Vogelsang]], "The Afghans", Blackwell Publishing, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/pakistan/ashford23may1964.htm Declassified], Zaher said there would be, as there are now, two official languages, Pashto and Farsi, though the latter would henceforth be named Dari.&lt;/ref&gt; Within their respective linguistic boundaries, Dari and Pashto are the media of education.

Deeplearning4j is [[open-source software]] released under [[Apache License]] 2.0,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Github Repository|url=https://github.com/agibsonccc/java-deeplearning}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed mainly by a [[machine learning]] group headquartered in [[San Francisco]] and [[Tokyo]] and led by Adam Gibson.&lt;ref name="deeplearning4j.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deeplearning4j.org/|title=deeplearning4j.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crunchbase Profile|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/person/adam-gibson}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is supported commercially by the startup Skymind, which bundles DL4J, [[Tensorflow]], [[Keras]] and other deep learning libraries in an enterprise distribution called the Skymind Intelligence Layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skymind Intelligence Layer Community Edition|url=https://skymind.ai/quickstart}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deeplearning4j was contributed to the [[Eclipse Foundation]] in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eclipse Deeplearning4j Project Page|url=https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/deeplearning4j}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skymind’s Deeplearning4j, the Eclipse Foundation, and scientific computing in the JVM|url=https://jaxenter.com/skymind-deeplearning4j-eclipse-138872.html|work=Jaxenter|accessdate=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Deeplearning4j relies on the widely used programming language [[Java (programming language)|Java]], though it is compatible with [[Clojure]] and includes a [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] [[application programming interface]] (API). It is powered by its own open-source numerical computing library, [[ND4J (software)|ND4J]], and works with both [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs) and [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs).&lt;ref name="om"&gt;{{cite web|first=Derrick|last=Harris|title=A startup called Skymind launches, pushing open source deep learning|work=[[GigaOM.com]]|date=2014-06-02|url=http://gigaom.com/2014/06/02/a-startup-called-skymind-launches-pushing-open-source-deep-learning/|accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vb"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jordan|last=Novet|title=Skymind launches with open-source, plug-and-play deep learning features for your app|date=2014-06-02|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/06/02/skymind-launches-with-open-source-plug-and-play-deep-learning-features-for-your-app//|accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeplearning4j has been used in several commercial and academic applications. The code is hosted on [[GitHub]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j Deeplearning4j source code]&lt;/ref&gt; A support forum is maintained on [[Gitter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://gitter.im/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j Deeplearning4j Gitter Support Channel]&lt;/ref&gt;

The framework is composable, meaning shallow neural nets such as restricted Boltzmann machines, convolutional nets, autoencoders, and recurrent nets can be added to one another to create deep nets of varying types. It also has extensive visualization tools,&lt;ref&gt;[http://deeplearning4j.org/visualization Deeplearning4j Visualization Tools]&lt;/ref&gt; and a computation graph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deeplearning4j.org/compgraph Deeplearning4j Computation Graph]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distributed==
Training with Deeplearning4j occurs in a cluster. Neural nets are trained in parallel via iterative reduce, which works on [[Hadoop]]-YARN and on [[Apache Spark|Spark]].&lt;ref name="deeplearning4j.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/emsixteeen/IterativeReduce|title=Iterative reduce}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deeplearning4j also integrates with CUDA kernels to conduct pure GPU operations, and works with distributed GPUs.

==Scientific computing for the JVM==
Deeplearning4j includes an n-dimensional array class using [[ND4J (software)|ND4J]] that allows scientific computing in Java and Scala, similar to the functions that [[NumPy]] provides to [[Python (programming language)|Python]]. It's effectively based on a library for [[linear algebra]] and [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] manipulation in a production environment.

==DataVec vectorization library for machine-learning==
DataVec vectorizes various file formats and data types using an [[input/output]] format system similar to Hadoop's use of MapReduce; that is, it turns various data types into columns of scalars termed [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vectors]]. DataVec is designed to vectorize CSVs, images, sound, text, video, and time series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deeplearning4j.org/datavec DataVec ETL for Machine Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.infoq.com/articles/deep-learning-time-series-anomaly-detection Anomaly Detection for Time Series Data with Deep Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text and NLP==
Deeplearning4j includes a [[vector space model]]ing and [[topic model]]ing toolkit, implemented in Java and integrating with parallel GPUs for performance. It is designed to handle large text sets.

Deeplearning4j includes implementations of term frequency–inverse document frequency ([[tf–idf]]), [[deep learning]], and Mikolov's word2vec algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;[https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ word2vec]&lt;/ref&gt; doc2vec, and GloVe, reimplemented and optimized in Java. It relies on [[t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding]] (t-SNE) for word-cloud visualizations.

==Real-world use cases and integrations==
Real-world use cases for Deeplearning4j include network intrusion detection and cybersecurity, fraud detection for the financial sector,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skymind.io/finance/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://skymind.ai/bsa-aml{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; anomaly detection in industries such as manufacturing, recommender systems in e-commerce and advertising,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skymind.io/commerce/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310082156/http://www.skymind.io/commerce/ |archivedate=2016-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and image recognition.&lt;ref&gt;https://skymind.ai/image{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deeplearning4j has integrated with other machine-learning platforms such as RapidMiner, Prediction.io,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rapidminerchina.com/en/products/shop/product/deeplearning4j/{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Weka (machine learning)|Weka]].&lt;ref&gt;https://deeplearning.cms.waikato.ac.nz/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Machine Learning Model Server==

Deeplearning4j serves machine-learning models for inference in production using the free developer edition of SKIL, the Skymind Intelligence Layer.&lt;ref&gt;https://skymind.ai/products&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://deeplearning4j.org/modelserver&lt;/ref&gt; A model server serves the parametric machine-learning models that makes decisions about data. It is used for the inference stage of a machine-learning workflow, after data pipelines and model training. A model server is the tool that allows data science research to be deployed in a real-world production environment.

What a Web server is to the Internet, a model server is to AI. Where a Web server receives an HTTP request and returns data about a Web site, a model server receives data, and returns a decision or prediction about that data: e.g. sent an image, a model server might return a label for that image, identifying faces or animals in photographs.

The SKIL model server is able to import models from Python frameworks such as Tensorflow, Keras, Theano and CNTK, overcoming a major barrier in deploying deep learning models.

==Benchmarks==
Deeplearning4j is as fast as Caffe for non-trivial image recognition tasks using multiple GPUs.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-benchmark&lt;/ref&gt; For programmers unfamiliar with HPC on the JVM, there are several parameters that must be adjusted to optimize neural network training time. These include setting the heap space, the garbage collection algorithm, employing off-heap memory and pre-saving data (pickling) for faster ETL.&lt;ref&gt;https://deeplearning4j.org/benchmark&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these optimizations can lead to a 10x acceleration in performance with Deeplearning4j.

==API Languages: Java, Scala, Python &amp; Clojure==
Deeplearning4j can be used via multiple API languages including Java, Scala, Python and Clojure. Its Scala API is called ScalNet.&lt;ref&gt;https://deeplearning4j.org/scala&lt;/ref&gt;  Keras serves as its Python API.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://deeplearning4j.org/keras# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225133010/https://deeplearning4j.org/keras# |archive-date=2017-02-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  And its Clojure wrapper is known as DL4CLJ.&lt;ref&gt;https://deeplearning4j.org/clojure&lt;/ref&gt; The core languages performing the large-scale mathematical operations necessary for deep learning are C, C++ and CUDA C.

==Tensorflow, Keras &amp; Deeplearning4j==

Tensorflow, Keras and Deeplearning4j work together. Deeplearning4j can import models from Tensorflow and other Python frameworks if they have been created with Keras.&lt;ref&gt;https://deeplearning4j.org/tensorflow&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Efatese''' is an artificial [[mixed language]] of [[Efate Island]] in Vanuatu. There are half a dozen languages spoken on Efate, of which the languages of [[North Efate language|North Efate]] and [[South Efate language|South Efate]] are not particularly closely related, and when missionary activity began on the island, at [[Port Havannah]] in the northwest of the island, a mixture of the target languages was invented for evangelism and scripture, in preference to promoting one indigenous language over the others.

'''Everything''' (or '''every thing''') is all that [[existence|exists]]; the opposite of [[nothing]], or its [[Opposite (semantics)|complement]]. It is the totality of things relevant to some [[theory|subject matter]]. Without expressed or implied [[Maxima and minima|limits]], it may refer to [[universal quantifier|anything]]. The [[Universe]] is everything that exists theoretically, though a [[multiverse]] may exist according to theoretical cosmology predictions. It may refer to an [[anthropocentric]] [[worldview]],&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite web
| title = everything
| url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/everything
| publisher = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary
| accessdate = 2008-06-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the sum of human experience, history, and the [[human condition]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;"This is the excellent foppery of the world..." — [[Shakespeare]], ''[[King Lear]]'',&lt;/ref&gt;  Every [[object (philosophy)|object]] and [[entity]] is a part of everything, including all [[physical body|physical bodies]] and in some cases all [[abstract object]]s.

==Scope==
In ordinary conversation, ''everything'' usually refers only to the totality of things relevant to the subject matter.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; When there is no expressed limitation, ''everything'' may refer to the [[universe]], the [[world]].

The ''Universe'' is most commonly defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of [[time]], all forms of [[matter]], [[energy]] and [[momentum]], and the [[physical law]]s and [[physical constant|constants]] that govern them. However, the term "universe" may be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting such concepts as the ''[[cosmos]]'', the ''[[world (philosophy)|world]]''  or ''[[Nature]]''. According to some speculations, this universe may be one of many disconnected universes, which are collectively denoted as the [[multiverse]]. In the [[bubble universe theory]], there is an infinite variety of universes, each with different [[physical constant]]s. In the [[many-worlds hypothesis]], new universes are spawned with every [[quantum measurement]]. By definition, these speculations cannot currently be tested experimentally, yet, if they{{clarify|reason='they' refers to 'these speculations', which obviously exist. Probably the entities the speculations are about are meant.|date=August 2013}} exist, they would still be part of everything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Especially in a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] context, ''World'' may refer to everything that constitutes [[reality]] and the [[Universe]]: see [[World (philosophy)]]. However, world may "only" refer to ''[[Earth]]'' envisioned from an [[anthropocentric]] or [[human]] [[worldview]], as a place by [[human beings]].

==In theoretical physics==
{{Main article|Theory of everything}}
In [[theoretical physics]], a ''theory of everything'' (TOE) is a hypothetical [[theory]] that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena. Initially, the term was used with an ironic connotation to refer to various overgeneralized theories. For example, a great-grandfather of [[Ijon Tichy]]—a character from a cycle of [[Stanisław Lem]]'s [[science fiction]] stories of 1960s—was known to work on the "General Theory of Everything". Over time, the term stuck in popularizations of [[quantum physics]] to describe a theory that would unify or explain through a single model the theories of all [[fundamental interaction]]s of nature.

There have been many theories of everything proposed by [[theoretical physicists]] over the last century, but none have been confirmed experimentally. The primary problem in producing a TOE is that the accepted theories of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]] are hard to combine. Whereas theories exploring quantum mechanics and string theory are easier to combine{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. 

Based on theoretical [[holographic principle]] arguments from the 1990s, many physicists believe that 11-dimensional [[M-theory]], which is described in many sectors by [[matrix string theory]], and in many other sectors by [[dual resonance model|perturbative string theory]], is the complete theory of everything. Other physicists disagree.

==In philosophy==
{{Main article|Theory of everything (philosophy)}}
In philosophy, a ''theory of everything'' or ''TOE'' is an ultimate, all-encompassing explanation of [[nature]] or [[reality]].&lt;ref name=Rescher2006a&gt;Rescher, Nicholas (2006a). "Holistic Explanation and the Idea of a Grand Unified Theory". Collected Papers IX: Studies in Metaphilosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rescher2006b&gt;Rescher, Nicholas (2006b). "The Price of an Ultimate Theory". Collected Papers IX: Studies in Metaphilosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker2002&gt;Walker, Mark Alan (March 2002). [http://www.jetpress.org/volume10/prolegomena.html "Prolegomena to Any Future Philosophy"]. Journal of Evolution and Technology Vol. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Adopting the term from physics, where the search for a [[theory of everything]] is ongoing, [[philosophers]] have discussed the viability of the concept and analyzed its properties and implications.&lt;ref name=Rescher2006a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rescher2006b/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker2002/&gt;  Among the questions to be addressed by a [[philosophical theory]] of everything are: "Why is reality understandable?"  "Why are the laws of nature as they are?"  "Why is there anything at all?"&lt;ref name=Rescher2006a/&gt;

In [[medicine]], a '''family history''' ('''FH''' or '''FHx''') consists of information about disorders from which the direct blood relatives of the patient have suffered. [[Genealogy]] typically includes very little of the [[medical history]] of the [[family]], but the medical history could be considered a specific subset of the total history of a family.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Accurate knowledge of a patient's family history may identify a predisposition to developing certain illnesses, which can inform clinical decisions and allow effective management or even prevention of conditions.

==Uses==
Although sometimes neglected,&lt;ref&gt;Rich E. C., et al. (2004) "Reconsidering the family history in primary care" in: ''J Gen Intern Med'' 2004;19:273-80. {{PMID|15009784}}.&lt;/ref&gt; many healthcare professionals glean information on family morbidity of particular diseases (e.g. [[cardiovascular disease]]s, [[autoimmune disorder]]s, [[mental disorders]], [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[cancer]]) to assess whether a person is at risk of developing similar problems. 

Family histories may be imprecise because of various possible reasons:
* Adoption, fostering, illegitimacy and adultery
* Lack of contact between close relatives
* Uncertainty about the relative's exact diagnosis
* In complex situations, a [[family tree]] or [[genogram]] may be used to organize the resulting information.

Some medical conditions are carried only by the female line such as [[X-linked recessive inheritance| X-linked conditions]] and some [[Mitochondrial disease| Mitochondrial diseases]]. Tracing female ancestors can be difficult in societies that change the woman's family name when she marries.  Death records often give the maiden name of the deceased, and possibly also the deceased's mother’s maiden name. Some of the most useful records for tracing women are wills and probate records.  

Other medical conditions are carried only by the male line, though these [[Y linkage| Y-linked conditions]] are rare owing to the small size of the Y Chromosome. Tracing male ancestors may be impossible if the conception is due to rape or sexual activity outside of a marriage.

==Consequences==
Not all positive family histories imply a genetic cause. If various members of the same family have been exposed to the same [[toxin]], then they may develop similar symptoms without a genetic cause.

If a patient has a strong family history of a particular disorder (or group of disorders), this will generally lead to a lower threshold for investigating symptoms or initiating treatment. This is seen particularly in cardiac disease, where a strong family history is considered a significant cardiovascular risk factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pandey|first=Arvind K.|author2=Shivda Pandey |author3=Michael J. Blaha |author4=Arthur Agatston |author5=Theodore Feldman |author6=Michael Ozner |author7=Raul D. Santos |author8=Matthew J. Budoff |author9=Roger S. Blumenthal |author10=Khurram Nasir |title=Family history of coronary heart disease and markers of subclinical cardiovascular disease: Where do we stand?|journal=Atherosclerosis|date=April 10, 2013|doi=10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2013.02.016|pmid=23578356|url=http://www.atherosclerosis-journal.com/article/S0021-9150(13)00126-3/abstract|accessdate=29 May 2014 |volume=228 |issue=2 |pages=285–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In diseases with a known hereditary component, many otherwise healthy people with a positive family history are tested early, with the aim of an early diagnosis and intervention to prevent the symptoms from developing. This has become accepted in [[hemochromatosis]] and various other disorders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1037">The '''Fowkes hypothesis''' (after F. M. Fowkes) is a first order approximation for surface energy. It states the surface energy is the sum of each component's forces:
 
γ=γ&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;+γ&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;+γ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;+...
where γ&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; is the dispersion component, γ&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; is the polar, γ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; is the dipole and so on.

The Fowkes hypothesis goes further making the approximation that the interface between an apolar liquid and apolar solid where there are only dispersive interactions acting across the interface can be estimated using the [[geometric mean]] of the contributions from each surface i.e.

γ&lt;sub&gt;SL&lt;/sub&gt;=γ&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;+γ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;-2(γ&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; x γ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2427">A '''fumblerule''' is a rule of language or linguistic style, humorously written in such a way that it breaks this rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Mania for Sentences | author = Dennis Joseph Enright | year = 1983 | publisher = Chatto &amp; Windus/Hogarth Press | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PD0eAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Fumblerules+date:0-1990&amp;dq=Fumblerules+date:0-1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fumblerules are a form of [[self-reference]].

The [[science]] [[editing|editor]] [[George L.

"'''Goonda'''" is a term used in the [[Indian subcontinent]] for a hired [[Crime|thug]]. It is both a colloquial term and defined and used in laws, generally referred to as '''Goonda Acts'''.&lt;ref name="Murali"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2005/02/02/stories/2005020200272000.htm |periodical=Hindu Business Line|date=2005-02-02|accessdate=2011-07-04|title=Get to know the ''goonda'', here and now|author=D. Murali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word comes from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word ''goondan''/''goondar'' (குண்டன் / குண்டர்)&lt;ref&gt;TAMIL LEXICON; VOL II., PART I;, UNIVERSITY OF MADRAS, 1982, PAGE 978&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Telugu language|Telugu]] word ''goonda'' (గూండా) as well as the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word ''guṇḍā'' ({{lang-hi|गुंडा}}, {{lang-ur|گنڈا}}, "rascal").&lt;ref name="Murali"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;{{citation|last=Barrett|first=Grant|title=The official dictionary of unofficial English: a crunk omnibus for thrillionaires and bampots for the Ecozoic Age|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2006|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fn-Sh1nv7pQC&amp;pg=PA148 148]&amp;ndash;149|isbn=978-0-07-145804-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the identically-spelled [[Marathi language|Marathi]] word with a similar meaning, attested as early as the 17th century, and possibly ultimately having [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=English language teaching in India: problems and issues|author=Qaiser Zoha Alam|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wze__srECioC&amp;pg=PA120 120]|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|year=1998|isbn=978-81-7156-554-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory suggests that it originates from the English word "goon". However, the first English-language appearance of "goonda" (in British newspapers of the 1920s, with the spelling "goondah") predates the use of "goon" to mean criminal, a [[semantic change]] which seems to go back only as far as the 1930s comic strip character [[Alice the Goon]].&lt;ref name="Murali"/&gt; A related term is "goonda-gardi", roughly meaning "bully-boy tactics".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |periodical=Dawn |last=Cowasjee |first=Ardeshir |title=No 'goonda-gardi'|date=2008-05-11|accessdate=2011-07-04 |url=http://archives.dawn.com/dawnftp/72.249.57.55/dawnftp/weekly/cowas/20081105.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is "goonda tax", referring to bribes or money extorted in a [[protection racket]].&lt;ref name="Barrett"/&gt;

==Definitions==
Many legislative bodies have passed "Goonda Acts" (a colloquial name, due to the long titles) providing legal definitions of who constitutes a "goonda". Some of these laws permit harsh treatment such as giving the police the power to shoot them on sight.&lt;ref name="Murali"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/kerala-goonda-act-minus-shootatsight-clause/109024/0|date=2004-06-29|accessdate=2011-07-04 |title=Kerala Goonda Act Minus Shoot-at-sight Clause|periodical=Financial Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===
[[Bangladesh]]'s Control of Disorderly and Dangerous Persons (Goondas) Act (East Bengal Act IV of 1954), Section 13(1), gives seven grounds under which a tribunal may declare a person to be a goonda and place him on the prescribed list of goondas:&lt;ref name="BD"&gt;{{citation|url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/print_sections_all.php?id=261|title=The Control of Disorderly and Dangerous Persons (Goondas) Act, 1954 (East Bengal Act)|publisher=Ministry of Law|publication-place=Bangladesh|accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#frequents for immoral purposes houses or localities inhabited by prostitutes; or
#frequents resorts of vice such as drinking or gambling dens, or places where opium or other intoxicating drugs are smoked or otherwise consumed; or
#generally appears in public while drunk; or
#is addicted to smoking opium; or
#uses obscene or abusive language in public; or
#makes fraudulent collection in the name of charity;
#is involved in affray, rowdyism or acts of intimidation or violence in any place private or public so as to cause alarm to the people living or frequenting the neighbourhood

Section 13(2) additionally establishes the category of "dangerous goonda", giving more than twenty further grounds on which a tribunal may declare a person to be a dangerous goonda, mostly related to violence, prostitution, and forgery, or offences committed by a person previously declared a goonda under the Act. Per Section 14, goondas may be required to post a bond, and may be restricted from entering gambling houses; dangerous goondas may have much broader restrictions placed on their freedom of movement, and per Section 18 also may have enhanced punishment imposed on them for future offences.&lt;ref name="BD"/&gt;

===India===
Many states of India have enacted special laws to deal with goondas.

====Madhya Pradesh====
[[Madhya Pradesh]] once had a goonda act in force, known as the [[Central Provinces and Berar]] Goondas Act (Act X of 1946), amended by Act XLIX of 1950. However it was struck down in 1960 in the [[Supreme Court of India]] case ''State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Baldeo Prasad''. The court held that "the definition of a goonda laid down by the Act, which is of an inclusive character, indicated no tests for deciding whether the person fell within the first part of the definition".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/882909/ |accessdate=2011-07-04 |title=The State Of Madhya Pradesh And Anr. vs Baldeo Prasad, 1961 AIR 293, 1961 SCR (1) 970|publisher=IndianKanoon.org|date=1960-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Uttar Pradesh====
The [[Uttar Pradesh]] Control of Goondas Act (U.P. Act No. 8 of 1971, amended by U.P. Act No. 1 of 1985) Section 2(b) defines a goonda as a person who:
# either by himself or as a member or leader of a gang, habitually commits or attempts to commit, or abets the commission of an offence punishable under Section 153 or Section 153-B or Section 294 of the Indian Penal Code or Chapter XV, Chapter XVI, Chapter XVII or Chapter XXII of the said Code; or
# has been convicted for an offence punishable under the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act, 1956; or
# has been convicted not less than thrice for an offence punishable under the U.P. Excise Act, 1910 or the Public Gambling Act, 1867 or Section 25, Section 27 or Section 29 of the Arms Act, 1959; or
# is generally reputed to be a person who is desperate and dangerous to the community; or
# has been habitually passing indecent remarks or teasing women or girls; or
# is a tout; or
# is a house-grabber.
Section 3 gives the district magistrate the power to order a goonda in writing to remove himself from a jurisdiction, or to report his movements, for periods of up to six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/1614514/ |title=Brahma Prakash Singh Vs. State of U.P. &amp; Others|date=2010-07-29 |accessdate=2011-07-04 |publisher=IndiaKanoon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rajasthan====
The [[Rajasthan]] Control of Goondas Act (Act No. 14 of 1975), in Section 2(b) defines who is a "goonda" for purposes of the Act.&lt;ref name="Jain"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/1614514/|publisher=IndianKanoon.org|title=Devendra Jain vs State Of Rajasthan And Anr. on 6 December, 2001, 2002 CriLJ 1655, 2002 (1) WLC 540|accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the similar act in Uttar Pradesh, it provided that goondas may be ordered to leave the district ("externment") for up to six months.&lt;ref name="Jain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;{{citation|title=HC gives goons a reason to smile |last=Singh|first=Sukhmani|periodical=The Indian Express|date=2002-01-05 |accessdate=2011-07-04 |url=http://www.indiarightsonline.com/Sabrang/armed2.nsf/38b852a8345861dd65256a980059289d/3f8ea45251825142e5256b3e00473f70?OpenDocument}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Rajasthan High Court]] struck down the externment provisions as unconstitutional in 2001.&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt; In particular, the Court pointed out that a person imprisoned had to be provided with a residential accommodation and subsistence at the expense of the state government, whereas the Control of Goondas Act made no provision for a goonda under externment to be provided with residential accommodation, putting him in a comparatively worse situation than a prisoner; this was held to violate the [[right to life]] guaranteed under Article 21 of the [[Constitution of India]].&lt;ref name="Jain"/&gt;

====Tamil Nadu====
The [[Tamil Nadu]] Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Drug-offenders, Forest-offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders, Slum-grabbers and Video Pirates Act (Tamil Nadu Act 14 of 1982; "Video Pirates" was not added by Act 32 of 2004), Section 2(f) states "''goonda'' means a person, who either by himself or as a member of or leader of a gang habitually commits, or attempts to commit or abets the commission of offence, punishable under Chapter XVI or Chapter XVII or Chapter XXII of the Indian Penal Code (Central Act XLV of 1860)".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.lawsofindia.org/statelaw/5557/TheTamilNaduPreventionofDangerousActivitiesofBootleggersDrugOffendersGoondasImmoralTrafficOffendersandSlumGrabbersAct1982.html|title=The Tamil Nadu Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Drug-offenders, Forest-offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders and Slum-grabbers Act|publisher=LawsOfIndia.org|accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2011 ruling of the Madras High Court, even a single offense under the Act permits detention of a person as a goonda.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=The Hindu|author=K. T. Sangameswaran|title=Tamil Nadu: Single case enough to detain person under Goondas Act|date=2011-06-25 |accessdate=2011-07-05 |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2011/06/25/stories/2011062565470900.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Karnataka====
The [[Karnataka]] Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Drug-Offenders, Gamblers, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders and Slum-Grabbers Act (Act 12 of 1985), as amended by Act 16 of 2001, in Section 2(g) states "''goonda'' means a person who either by himself or as a member of or leader of a gang, habitually commits or attempts to commit or abets the commission of offences punishable under Chapter VIII, Chapter XV, Chapter XVI, Chapter XVII or Chapter XXII of the Indian Penal Code (Central Act XLV of 1860)".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://dpal.kar.nic.in/.%5C12%20of%201985%20(E).pdf |publisher=Department of Parliamentary Affairs and Legislation, Government of Karnataka|title=The Karnataka Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Drug-Offenders, Gamblers, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders and Slum-Grabbers Act|accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the Karnataka government brought most offences under the Information Technology Act, 2000, and Indian Copyright Act, 1957, under the ambit of the Goonda Act. Until now, people with a history of offences like bootlegging, drug offences and immoral trafficking could be taken into preventive custody. But the government, in its enthusiasm, while adding acid attackers and sexual predators to the law, has also added 'digital offenders', meaning "any person who knowingly or deliberately violates, for commercial purposes, any copyright law in relation to any book, music, film, software, artistic or scientific work and also includes any person who illegally enters through the identity of another user and illegally uses any computer or digital network for pecuniary gain for himself or any other person or commits any of the offences specified under sections 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74 and 75 of the Information Technology Act, 2000".&lt;ref&gt;http://cis-india.org/news/bangalore-mirror-shyam-prasad-august-4-2014-we-the-goondas&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kerala====
The [[Kerala]] Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act (Act 34 of 2007), Section 2(j), states "''goonda'' means a person who indulges in any anti-social activity or promotes or abets any illegal activity which are harmful for the maintenance of the public order directly or indirectly and includes a bootlegger, a counterfeiter, a depredator of environment, a digital data and copy right pirate, a drug offender, a hawala racketeer, a hired ruffian, rowdy, an immoral traffic offender, a loan shark or a property grabber".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.keralapolice.org/newsite/pdfs/kaapa/kaapa.pdf |title=Act 34 of 2007: The Kerala Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 2007 |publisher=Kerala Police|accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Punjab====
The [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] Control of Goondas Ordinance (W.P. Ordinance XXXV of 1959), Section 13, establishes a list of more than twenty offences (mostly related to violence, public drunkenness, sexual crimes, and habitual counterfeiting or smuggling) under which a tribunal may declare a person a "goonda" and place his name on the prescribed list of goondas, after which he may be subject to enhanced punishment for any future offenses. It overrode the earlier Punjab Control of Goondas Act (Act XIV of 1951).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://punjablaws.gov.pk/laws/112.html|title=The Punjab Control of Goondas Ordinance, 1959|publisher=Government of Pakistan |accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindi uses more words closer to Sanskrit while Urdu incorporates more Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]], and Turkish words. Most shairo shairy, ghazals, qawalis &amp; lyrics use Urdu words.

==History==
Before the [[partition of British India]], Hindi was spoken in the region forming Pakistan by the [[Hindus]] and [[Sikhs]] residing there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1159561|title=Century-old Golra Railway station now a site for museum goers|work=Dawn|date=10 April 2015|accessdate=22 September 2015|first=Shiraz|last=Hassan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sinha"/&gt; It was taught across school and university levels, mainly in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]].&lt;ref name="Sinha2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/learning-hindi-in-pakistan-165053.html|title=Learning Hindi in Pakistan|work=[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]|date=15 September 2016|accessdate=16 May 2017|first=R.K.|last=Sinha}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the partition, most of these communities left for [[India]]; prominent Hindi writers with origins in Pakistan include [[Bhisham Sahni]], [[Shailendra (lyricist)|Shailendra]], [[Hullad Moradabadi]], [[Uday Bhanu Hans]], [[Narendra Mohan (poet)|Narendra Mohan]] and others.&lt;ref name="Sinha2"/&gt; Conversely, some first-generation Pakistanis who [[Muhajir people|migrated from India]] during Pakistan's independence in 1947 were familiar with Hindi and the [[Devanagari script]].&lt;ref name="DNA2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1039277/language-has-no-religion-pakistani-lawyer-fuses-urdu-hindi-in-calligraphy/|title='Language has no religion': Pakistani lawyer fuses Urdu, Hindi in calligraphy|work=The Express Tribune|date=3 February 2016|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Urdu was long associated with the Muslims of [[South Asia]] by virtue of its historical development and the [[Urdu movement]]. During the [[Pakistan Movement]], it was given preference over Hindi as their [[lingua franca]] and thus achieved official status in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1243652|title=Is Pakistan’s problem Urdu?|work=Dawn|date=5 March 2016|accessdate=20 May 2017|first=Pervez|last=Hoodbhoy|authorlink=Pervez Hoodbhoy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic study==
Hindi has drawn increasing focus as an academic subject.&lt;ref name="DNA2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-hindi-finds-more-and-more-takers-in-pakistan-2125555|title=Hindi finds more and more takers in Pakistan|work=DNA India|date=16 September 2015|accessdate=22 September 2015|first=Rohinee|last=Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing trend of Hindi experts and the availability of texts in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="DNA2"/&gt; Many Hindi instructors migrated from India, or were educated at Indian universities.&lt;ref name="Sinha"/&gt;

The Department of Hindi at the [[National University of Modern Languages]] (NUML) in [[Islamabad]] was established in 1973. It became the first university department in Pakistan to provide certificates, diplomas, language courses, Masters and PhD degrees in Hindi,&lt;ref name="NUML"/&gt; including the country's first Hindi [[MPhil]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/islamabad/31-Aug-2015/numl-awards-country-s-first-ever-mphil-degree-in-hindi|title=NUML awards country’s first ever MPhil degree in Hindi|work=Daily Times|date=31 August 2015|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/in-a-first-pak-varsity-awards-mphil-in-hindi/127064.html|title=In a first, Pak varsity awards MPhil in Hindi|work=Tribune India|date=1 September 2015|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has provided instruction to Pakistani as well as foreign students.&lt;ref name="NUML"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.numl.info/hindi.aspx|title=Department of Hindi|work=National University of Modern Languages|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sinha"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/columnists/oped/the-charm-of-hindi-in-pakistan.html|title=The charm of Hindi in Pakistan|work=[[The Pioneer (newspaper)|The Pioneer]]|date=14 September 2016|accessdate=16 May 2017|first=R.K.|last=Sinha|authorlink=Ravindra Kishore Sinha|quote=...For the last many years, a large number of Chinese are taking lessons in Hindi in Pakistan. Not only the Chinese, many officials of Islamic countries, including the United Arab Emirates, too are learning Hindi in Pakistan. That Pakistan is emerging as a seat of Hindi learning and teaching is a revelation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Hindi Department at the [[University of the Punjab]] in Lahore has roots going back to the establishment of the [[Oriental College]]; however, it wasn't until 1983 that accredited courses were started. The department awards both undergraduate and postgraduate Hindi courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pu.edu.pk/home/department/28/Department-of-Hindi |title=Hindi Department |work=University of the Punjab |accessdate=21 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315213503/http://pu.edu.pk/home/department/28/Department-of-Hindi |archivedate=March 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the University of Punjab's Centre for South Asian Studies, Hindi is a mandatory subject for those pursuing an M.Phil in regional languages.&lt;ref name="DNA2"/&gt;

The [[University of Karachi]] also once had a Hindi department, which was later closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/902570/cross-border-relations-we-are-fighting-the-same-battle-for-human-rights/|title=Cross-border relations: ‘We are fighting the same battle for human rights’|work=The Express Tribune|date=12 June 2015|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural influence==
As a result of [[Bollywood]] films, [[Indian soap opera]] viewership and cable television in Pakistan, Hindi has had a notable cultural influence.&lt;ref name="DNA2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1175370|title=Did you know?

'''Christopher Murray Grieve''' (11 August 1892 – 9 September 1978), known by his pen name '''Hugh MacDiarmid''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|k|ˈ|d|ɜːr|m|ɪ|d|}}), was a Scottish poet, journalist, essayist and political figure. He is best known for his works written in 'synthetic Scots', a literary version of the [[Scots language]] that MacDiarmid himself developed. However, Grieve's earliest work -- such as ''[[Annals of the Five Senses]]'' was written in English, and from the early 1930s onwards much of the poetry published under MacDiarmid's name was written in an English that was supplemented to varying degrees by scientific and technical vocabularies.

The son of a postman, MacDiarmid was born in the Scottish border town of [[Langholm]], [[Dumfriesshire]]. He was educated at Langholm Academy before becoming a teacher for a brief time at Broughton Higher Grade School in [[Edinburgh]]. He began his writing career as a journalist in Wales,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hugh MacDiarmid {{!}} Poetry {{!}} Scottish Poetry Library|url = http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poetry/poets/hugh-macdiarmid|website = www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Selected Essays of Hugh MacDiarmid|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bfwpDnKJnagC|publisher = University of California Press|date = 1970-01-01|isbn = 9780520016187|language = en|first = Hugh|last = MacDiarmid}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Writing Scotland - Hugh MacDiarmid - BBC Two|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/60m5vt5DBNq4q02PQtpFqzq/hugh-macdiarmid|website = BBC|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributing to the socialist newspaper ''[[The Merthyr Pioneer]]'' run by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] founder [[Keir Hardie]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; before joining the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] on the outbreak of the First World War.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He served in Salonica, Greece and France before developing cerebral malaria and subsequently returning to Scotland in 1918. MacDiarmid's time in the army was influential in his political and artistic development.

After the war he continued to work as a journalist, living in Montrose where he became editor and reporter of the ''Montrose Review''&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Grieve, Christopher Murray (Hugh MacDiarmid) genealogy Scotland  - ScotlandsPeople|url = http://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/content/help/index.aspx?1115|website = www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a justice of the peace and a member of the county council. In 1923 his first book, ''Annals of the Five Senses,'' was published at his own expense, followed by 'Sangschaw' in 1925 and 'Penny Wheep' and 'A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle' in 1926. ''[[A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle]]'', is generally regarded as MacDiarmid's most famous and influential work.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Moving to the Shetland island of [[Whalsay]] in 1933 with his son Michael and second wife, Valda Trevlyn, MacDiarmid continued to write essays and poetry despite being cut off from mainland cultural developments for much of the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He died at his cottage Brownsbank, near [[Biggar, South Lanarkshire|Biggar]], in 1978 at the age of 86.

MacDiarmid was during his life a supporter of both [[communism]] and [[Scottish nationalism]], views that often put him at odds with his contemporaries. He was a founding member of the [[National Party of Scotland]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (forerunner of the modern [[Scottish National Party]]) and stood as a candidate for the Scottish National Party in 1945 and 1950, and for the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] in 1964.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A controversial figure whilst alive, MacDiarmid is now considered one of the principal forces behind the [[Scottish Renaissance]] and has had a lasting impact on Scottish culture and politics. Fellow poet [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]] said of him: 'Eccentric and often maddening genius he may be, but MacDiarmid has produced many works which, in the only test possible, go on haunting the mind and memory and casting [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridgean]] seeds of insight and surprise.’&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Christopher Grieve was born in Langholm in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Bold, Alan. "MacDiarmid". London: Paladin, 1190. p 35.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a postman; his family lived above the town library, giving MacDiarmid access to books from an early age. Grieve attended [[Langholm Academy]] and, from 1908, [[Broughton Junior Student Centre]] in [[Edinburgh]], where he studied under George Ogilvie who introduced him to the magazine [[The New Age]].  He left the school on 27 January 1911, following the theft of some books and postage stamps; his father died eight days later, on 3 February 1911.

Following Grieve's departure from Broughton, Ogilvie arranged for Grieve to be employed as a journalist with the ''[[Edinburgh Evening Dispatch]]''. Grieve was to lose this job later in 1911, but on 20 July of that year he had his first article, "The Young Astrology" published in ''The New Age''. Later in 1922{{clarify|date=July 2015}} Grieve moved to [[Ebbw Vale]] in [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]], where he worked as a newspaper reporter; by 1913 he had returned to Scotland and was working for the ''[[Clydebank and Renfrew Press]]'' in [[Clydebank]], near [[Glasgow]]. It was here that Grieve first encountered the work of [[John Maclean (Scottish socialist)|John Maclean]], [[Neil Malcolm Maclean]], and [[James Maxton]].

===First World War===
In July 1915 Grieve left the town of [[Forfar]] in eastern Scotland and travelled to the Hillsborough barracks in [[Sheffield]]. He went on to serve in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] in [[Salonica]], [[Greece]] and [[France]] during the [[World War I|First World War]]. After the war, he married and returned to journalism.

===Return to Scotland===
MacDiarmid's first book, ''Annals of the Five Senses'', was a mixture of prose and poetry written in English, and was published in 1923 while MacDiarmid was living in Montrose. At about this time MacDiarmid turned to Scots for a series of books, culminating in what is probably his best known work, the book-length ''[[A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle]]''. This poem is widely regarded as one of the most important long poems in 20th-century [[Scottish literature]]. After that, he published several books containing poems in both English and Scots.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Time in England===
From 1929 to 1930 MacDiarmid lived in London, and worked for [[Compton Mackenzie]]'s magazine, ''Vox''. MacDiarmid lived in Liverpool from 1930 to 1931, before returning to London; he left again in 1932, and lived in the village of [[Thakeham]] in West Sussex until he returned to Scotland in 1932.

===Shetland===
MacDiarmid lived in the island of [[Whalsay]], Shetland, from 1933 until 1942.

===Return to the Scottish Mainland===
In 1942 MacDiarmid was directed to war work and moved to Glasgow, where he lived until 1949. Between 1949 and 1951 he lived in a cottage on the grounds of [[Dungavel House]], [[Lanarkshire]], before moving to his final home: "Brownsbank", a cottage in [[Candymill]], near [[Biggar, South Lanarkshire|Biggar]] in the Scottish Borders. He died, aged 86, in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;Bold, Alan. "MacDiarmid". London: Paladin, 1190. p 493.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
In 1928, MacDiarmid helped found the [[National Party of Scotland]], but was expelled during the 1930s.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

MacDiarmid was at times a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], but he was expelled twice, and biographer John Baglow reports that "his comrades never really knew what to make of him". He joined the party in 1934, was expelled in 1937, rejoined later that same year, and was expelled seemingly for good in 1938, on the grounds of "national deviationism". He rejoined the party again much later, in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = John Baglow | title = Hugh MacDiarmid: The Poetry of Self | publisher = McGill-Queen's University Press | year = 1987 | page = 115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1931, whilst he was in London, until 1943, after he had left the Shetland island of [[Whalsay]], MacDiarmid was watched by the British Intelligence Services.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Lyall, '"The Man is a Menace": MacDiarmid and Military Intelligence', in ''Scottish Studies Review'' 8.1, Spring 2007, pp. 37-52.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, [[George Orwell]] compiled [[Orwell's list|a list of suspected communist sympathisers for British intelligence]]. He included MacDiarmid in this list.

He was a member of [[Clann Albain]], a secret Scottish nationalist society.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ie/books?id=kPljDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=clann+albain&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VekGaj8K0E&amp;sig=lPRACU2IGOO7SoFAuc17iAYXacM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidl8XU19jaAhVHKsAKHZAbCX8Q6AEIRTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=clann%20albain&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDiarmid stood in the [[Glasgow Kelvingrove (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Kelvingrove]] constituency in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950]] general elections. He stood against the Conservative Prime Minister [[Alec Douglas-Home]] in [[Kinross and Western Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Kinross and Western Perthshire]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 election]], taking only 127 votes.

MacDiarmid listed [[Anglophobia]] among his hobbies in his ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'' entry.

In 2010 letters were discovered showing that he believed a Nazi invasion of Britain would benefit Scotland. In a letter sent from Whalsay, Shetland, in April 1941, he wrote: “On balance I regard the Axis powers, tho’ more violently evil for the time being, less dangerous than our own government in the long run and indistinguishable in purpose." A year earlier, in June 1940, he wrote: “Although the Germans are appalling enough, they cannot win, but the British and French bourgeoisie can and they are a far greater enemy. If the Germans win they could not hold their gain for long, but if the French and British win it will be infinitely more difficult to get rid of them.” 

Marc Horne in the ''Daily Telegraph'' commented: "MacDiarmid flirted with fascism in his early thirties, when he believed it was a doctrine of the left. In two articles written in 1923, Plea for a Scottish Fascism and Programme for a Scottish Fascism, he appeared to support Mussolini’s regime. By the 1930s however, following Mussolini’s lurch to the right, his position had changed and he castigated [[Neville Chamberlain]] over his appeasement of Hitler’s expansionism."&lt;ref Name="Timesletter"/&gt; Deirdre Grieve, MacDiarmid’s daughter-in-law and literary executor, noted: “I think he entertained almost every ideal it was possible to entertain at one point or another."&lt;ref Name="Timesletter"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article7086809.ece  ''The Sunday Times'' 4 April 2010 "Hugh MacDiarmid: I’d prefer Nazi rule"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later writings==

[[Image:Macdiarmid memorial 1.jpg|thumb|right|MacDiarmid Memorial near Langholm]]
As his interest in science and linguistics increased, MacDiarmid found himself turning more and more to English as a means of expression so that most of his later poetry is written in that language. His ambition was to live up to [[Rilke]]'s dictum that 'the poet must know everything' and to write a poetry that contained all knowledge. As a result, many of the poems in ''Stony Limits'' (1934) and later volumes are a kind of [[found poetry]] reusing text from a range of sources. Just as he had used Jameson's dialect dictionary for his poems in 'synthetic Scots', so he used Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary for poems such as 'On a Raised Beach'.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Whitworth, ‘Hugh MacDiarmid and Chambers’s Twentieth Century Dictionary,’ Notes and Queries, 55 (2008), 78-80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other poems, including 'On a Raised Beach' and 'Etika Preobrazhennavo Erosa' used extensive passages of prose.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Whitworth, ‘Three Prose Sources for Hugh MacDiarmid’s “On a Raised Beach,”’ Notes and Queries, 54 (2007), 175-77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Whitworth, ‘Forms of Culture in Hugh MacDiarmid’s “Etika Preobrazhennavo Erosa,”’ International Journal of Scottish Literature, no.5 (Autumn/Winter 2009).  www.ijsl. stir.ac.uk.&lt;/ref&gt; This practice, particularly in the poem 'Perfect', led to accusations of [[plagiarism]]&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Gordon Porteus, letter, TLS (4 Feb. 1965), 87&lt;/ref&gt; from supporters of the Welsh poet [[Glyn Jones (Welsh writer)|Glyn Jones]], to which MacDiarmid's response was 'The greater the plagiarism the greater the work of art.' The great achievement of this late poetry is to attempt on an [[Epic poetry|epic]] scale to capture the idea of a world without God in which all the facts the poetry deals with are scientifically verifiable. In his critical work ''Lives of the Poets'', Michael Schmidt notes that Hugh MacDiarmid 'had redrawn the map of Scottish poetry and affected the whole configuration of English literature'.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Michael: ''Lives of the Poets'', page 643. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDiarmid wrote a number of non-fiction prose works, including ''Scottish Eccentrics'' and his autobiography ''Lucky Poet''. He also did a number of translations from [[Scottish Gaelic]], including [[Duncan Ban MacIntyre]]'s ''Praise of Ben Dorain'', which were well received by native speakers including [[Sorley MacLean]].

==Personal life==
He had a daughter, Christine, and a son, Walter, by his first wife Peggy Skinner. He had a son, [[Michael Grieve|James Michael Trevlyn]], known as Michael, by his second wife Valda Trevlyn (1906-1989); Michael was a [[conscientious objector]] to post-World War II National Service and became vice chair of the [[Scottish National Party]].

==Places of interest==
MacDiarmid grew up in the Scottish town of [[Langholm]] in [[Dumfriesshire]].

MacDiarmid lived in [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] for a time where he worked for the local newspaper the ''[[Montrose Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Lyall, '"Genius in a Provincial Town": MacDiarmid's Poetry and Politics in Montrose', in ''Scottish Studies Review'' 5.2, Autumn 2004, pp. 41-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDiarmid also lived on the isle of [[Whalsay]] in [[Shetland]], in [[Sodom, Shetland|Sodom]] (Sudheim). The house is now one of Shetland's 'Camping Bods', offering basic, bothy-style accommodation to visitors.

Brownsbank Cottage, near [[Biggar, South Lanarkshire]], the home of  MacDiarmid and his wife Valda from 1952 until their deaths, has been restored by the [[Biggar Museum Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biggarmuseumtrust.co.uk/home/brownsbank-cottage |title=Brownsbank cottage - Biggar Museum |work=biggarmuseumtrust.co.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015062014/http://www.biggarmuseumtrust.co.uk/home/brownsbank-cottage |archivedate=15 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3632">:''This article is about the tool for architectural spatial analysis called isovist theory. Isovist is also a brand name for the chemical [[iotrolan]].
{{no footnotes|date=November 2014}}
[[File:Isovist.svg|thumb|The pale blue area is the point isovist that can be seen from the centre of the circle]]
A single '''isovist''' is the volume of space visible from a given point in space, together with a specification of the location of that point.  Isovists are naturally three-dimensional, but they may also be studied in two dimensions: either in horizontal section ("plan") or in other vertical sections through the three-dimensional isovist. Every point in physical space has an isovist associated with it.

The boundary-shape of an isovist may or may not vary with location in, say, a room.  If the room is [[convex polygon|convex]] (for example, a rectangle or circle), then the boundary-shape of every isovist in that room is the same; and so is its volume (or area, if we are thinking in plan).  But the location of the viewpoint relative to the boundary would or could be different. However, if the room were non-convex (for example, an L-shaped or partitioned room), then there would be many isovists whose volume (area) would be less than that of the whole room, and perhaps some that were the whole room; and many would have different, perhaps unique shapes: large and small, narrow and wide, centric and eccentric, whole and shredded.

One can also think of the isovist as the volume of space illuminated by a point source of light.

It is used in the field of [[architecture]] for analysis of buildings and urban areas, typically as one of a series of methods used in [[space syntax]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5835">[[File:Ben avi.jpg|thumb|180px|Itamar Ben-Avi, 1912]]
'''Itamar Ben-Avi''' ({{Lang|he|איתמר בן-אב"י}}) (born 31 July 1882, died 8 April 1943) was the first native speaker of Hebrew in modern times. He was a journalist and Zionist activist.

==Biography==
[[File:Itamar Ben-Avi.jpg|thumb|150px|Itamar Ben-Avi as a child]]
Itamar Ben-Avi was born as '''Ben-Zion Ben-Yehuda''' ({{Lang|he|בן-ציון בן-יהודה}}) in [[Jerusalem]] on July 31, 1882, the son of Deborah and [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]].&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/this-day-in-jewish-history/.premium-1.650881 First Boy to Be Raised Speaking Modern Hebrew Dies]&lt;/ref&gt; Eliezer is credited with reviving the [[Hebrew language]]; Itamar was brought up to be the first native speaker of Hebrew in the modern era. At his father's insistence, Itamar was not permitted to hear any language other than Hebrew at home. When he was very young, Itamar always wanted someone to play with, but his parents did not want him to speak with the other children who spoke different languages. He made friends with a dog which he called Maher ([[Hebrew]]: מהר), meaning "fast" in Hebrew. His three siblings died in a [[diphtheria]] epidemic and his mother died of tuberculosis in 1891. He and his family were [[ostracized]] from the [[Haredi Judaism|ultra-orthodox]] community, due to their usage of Hebrew as a day-to-day language. The religious community saw this as [[sacrilege]] because they viewed it as the language of the [[Torah]] and prayers, and not for use in "idle chatter."

After his mother's death in 1891, his father married his late wife's younger sister, the writer [[Hemda Ben-Yehuda]] (née Beila Jonas), so Itamar's aunt became his stepmother. After his mother's death, he changed his name to Itamar, as that was the name his parents originally intended to give him. The name ''Itamar'' means "Island of [[Phoenix dactylifera|Date]]s" and derives from the [[Hebrew]] word ''tamar'' (date or palm tree), which is a symbol of Zionism. As his last name, he used Ben-Avi. ''Avi'' (אב"י) is an acronym for '''E'''liezer '''B'''en '''Y'''ehuda (as written in Hebrew) and also means "my father", so Ben-Avi means "my father's son".

At the age of 19, Ben-Avi sailed to [[Europe]] and studied at universities in [[Paris]] and [[Berlin]]. He returned to Palestine in 1908 as a [[journalist]], joining his father in editing and writing Hebrew newspapers.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

Ben-Avi married Leah Abushedid (1889-1982), born in Jerusalem to a wealthy [[Moroccan Jews|Moroccan-Jewish]] family. Ben-Avi met her when he was 26 and she was 16. Due to his poor financial situation, his [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] background, and their age difference, Abushedid's parents did not approve of their marriage. Hoping to convince her parents, he published poems proclaiming his love for her in [[HaZvi|HaOr]]. After three years, when he  published a poem about suicide, they relented and permitted the marriage. After two years of negotiating the marriage contract, the couple married in 1914.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; They had three daughters: Dror-Eilat (1917-1921), Drora (1922-1981), and Rina (1925-2016).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geni.com/people/Itamar-Ben-Avi/6000000020023212718&lt;/ref&gt; Drora and Rina became radio news broadcasters.

In 1919, he founded a Hebrew daily newspaper called ''Doar HaYom'' (The Daily Mail), and ran it until 1929. In addition, he was a Zionist activist and officer with [[Bnei Binyamin]] and the [[Jewish National Fund]].&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; He served as a Jewish National Fund emissary to various countries. He also had a role in the founding of [[Netanya]].  

In 1939, as his financial situation deteriorated and in need of a steady income, Ben-Avi left his family for the [[United States]] to take up a posting as the Jewish National Fund representative in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; He died there in 1943 at the age of 60, five years before the establishment of [[Israel]]. His body was brought back to Palestine for burial in 1947, and was buried on the [[Mount of Olives]] in [[Jerusalem]].

==Journalism and literary career==
[[File:Ha savuja ha palestini title.gif|thumb|Ha Savuja ha Palestini (11 January 1929).]]
He was the chief editor and journalist of ''[[Doar HaYom]]'', the then Hebrew style-twin of the British ''[[Daily Mail]]'', from 1920-1933. In his numerous opinion and commentary articles in ''Doar HaYom'' he also advocated the widespread use of the International language [[Esperanto]].

Ben-Avi was an advocate for the [[Romanization of Hebrew]]. He favored the [[Latin alphabet]], a full alphabet with vowel letters, rather than the traditional [[Hebrew alphabet]], a consonantal orthography of Hebrew (with limited [[matres lectionis]]) using "squared Assyrian letters". The Hebrew writing system dates back to the time of [[Ezra]] the scribe, 500 BCE.

He wrote a Hebrew biography of his father. This biography was titled ''Avi'' ("My Father") and was printed in his own made-up version of a Hebrew alphabet using Latin letters and some variations thereof. He pioneered and was chief editor of two short lived Hebrew weeklies in reformed Latin script. The first was ''Hashavua Hapalestini'' (The Palestinian Week, 1928) and the second was ''Dror'' (Liberty, 1934).

'''Joachim (Ḥayyim) Oppenheim''', also known as '''Joachim Heinrich Oppenheim''',&lt;ref name=kehila&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kehila-olomouc.cz/rs/1739/phdr-berthold-oppenheim/|title=PhDr. Berthold Oppenheim|date=Dec 4, 2008|language=cs|access-date=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (29 September 1832 – 27 April 1891) was a Czech [[rabbi]] and author.

He was born at [[Ivančice|Eibenschütz]], [[Moravia]]. After receiving his first instruction from his father, Bernhard Oppenheim, rabbi of Eibenschütz, he went to [[Brünn]], where he attended the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (1849-1853), and then entered the [[University of Vienna]], continuing his [[Talmudic]] studies under Rabbi [[Lazar Horowitz]].&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

Having graduated in 1857, he succeeded his brother David as rabbi of [[Jamnitz]] in 1858, and his father as rabbi of Eibenschütz in 1860. In 1868, he was called to serve as rabbi of [[Toruń|Thorn]].&lt;ref name=kehila/&gt;&lt;ref name=je/&gt; He held this last rabbinate until his death on 27 April 1891, in [[Berlin]], where he had undergone a surgical operation.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

Of Oppenheim's independent publications, only two [[Sermon#Jewish tradition|sermons]] are known, entitled "''Das Tal-Gebet''" (Vienna, 1862); but he was a frequent contributor to Jewish scientific magazines, writing by preference in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Oppenheim contributed to [[Zecharias Frankel]]'s "''[[Monatsschrift für die Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judenthums]]''", S. Sonneschein's "''Homiletische Monatsschrift''", Joseph Isaac Kobak's "''Jeschurun''", "''[[Hamagid|Ha-Maggid]]''", "''Ha-Karmel''", "''Ha-Shaḥar''", "''Bet Talmud''", and to various Hebrew year-books.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bechor-shor-gad.JPG|thumb|200px|Title page from the Bible commentary of '''Joseph ben Isaac Bekhor Shor'''.]] --&gt;'''Joseph ben Isaac Bekhor Shor''' of [[Orleans]] (12th century) ([[Hebrew]]: '''יוֹסֵף בֶּן־יִצחָק בְּכוֹר־שׁוֹר''') was a [[France|French]] [[tosafist]], exegete, and poet who flourished in the second half of the 12th century.

== Biography ==
Joseph was a pupil of [[Jacob Tam]], [[Joseph Kara]], and [[Samuel ben Meïr]] (Rashbam).  The identity of '''Joseph Bekor Shor''' and the tosafist '''Joseph ben Isaac of Orleans''' has been sufficiently demonstrated by Gross, who showed that the same explanations given in the [[Tosafot]] ([[Hullin|Ḥul.]] 112-b; [[Yebamoth|Yeb.]] 25-b, 36-b) in the name of "Joseph ben Isaac", are quoted in the ''Semak'' (No. 205) and in [[Meir of Rothenburg]]'s Responsa (ed. Prague, No. 863) as those of "Joseph Bekor Shor."

== Biblical commentaries ==
Joseph was on very friendly terms with his teacher [[Jacob Tam]], with whom he carried on a learned correspondence (''Sefer ha-Yashar'', p.&amp;nbsp;71a). Besides tosafot on the greater part of the [[Talmud]], he wrote a [[Biblical]] commentary marked by considerable acumen. Even more than [[Rashi]], to whose exegetical school he belonged, he confined himself to literal interpretations ([[peshat]]). Anticipating later [[Biblical criticism]], he assumed the presence of duplicate narratives in the Bible, and he strove to give rational explanations to the miraculous stories. Thus he interprets "[[tree of life]]" ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] ii. 9) as "tree of healing", explaining that the fruit of the tree possessed the virtue of healing the sick, without, however, bestowing eternal life. In regard to the transformation of [[Lot's wife]] into a pillar of salt (Gen. xix. 26) he explains that, disbelieving in the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], she lingered on the road, and was overtaken by the rain of brimstone and fire, which are usually mixed with salt.

Well acquainted with the [[Vulgate]] and [[Christian]] [[Biblical exegesis]], Joseph, in commenting on [[Psalm]] ii., cites [[Jerome]], whose explanation of the word he criticizes. His commentary on the [[Pentateuch]] is still extant in manuscript in the libraries of [[Leyden]] and [[Munich]]. Part of it, on [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], was published by [[Jellinek]] ([[Leipzig|Leipsic]], 1855). Extracts from the remaining books were published by [[Abraham Berliner|Berliner]] in ''Peleṭat Soferim'' (1872).

His commentary on the Pentateuch has been published in Hebrew by Mossad HaRav Kook.

Rabbi Bekhor Shore was explicitly anti-Christian, since he wrote commentaries on [[Genesis 1#Genesis 1:1–2:3|Genesis 1:26]] (against the belief in the [[Trinity]]), on [[Behaalotecha#Readings#Seventh reading — Numbers 11:30–12:16|Book of Numbers 12:8]] (against Christian allegorizing) and on [[Re'eh#Readings#Third reading — Deuteronomy 12:29–13:19|Deuteronomy 13]], tempting to connect the magical powers of [[false prophets]] with the [[miracles of Jesus]] in the New Testament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1 = Prof. Rabbi Martin Lockshin | url = https://thetorah.com/can-a-false-prophet-perform-miracles/ | title = Can a False Prophet Perform Miracles? | access-date = Oct 3, 2018 | website = thetorah.com | archive-url = | archive-date = | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Selichot ==
Joseph was the author also of a number of liturgical poems ([[piyyut]]im). Besides the short hymns in the style of [[Moses ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]] with which he concludes each section of the commentary, he wrote the following [[selihot]]:

* ד' אליך עיני ישברו, believed by Zunz to have been written on the martyrs of [[Blois]] and [[Bray-sur-Seine|Bray]]
* מועד אדון כתקח, fourteen strophes 
* אדון רב העלילה, with two refrains – והשב and ושוב
*  אין לבנון די בער, fifteen strophes, ending with לה' אלהינו הרחמים והסליחות
* אל אלהי האלהים ואדוני, fourteen strophes 
* ממכון שבתך אלהים, twenty-six strophes

The [[Israel]]i population is a linguistically and culturally diverse community. The 19th edition of [[Ethnologue]] lists 35 languages and dialects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=IL|title=Israel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoken in local communities. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is the country's official language, and almost the entire population speaks it either as native speakers or proficiently as a  [[second language]]. Its standard form, known as [[Modern Hebrew]], is the main medium of life in Israel. [[Arabic language|Arabic]], used mainly by Israel's Arab minority, which comprises about one-fifth of the population, has a special status under Israeli law. [[English language|English]], spoken as a second language by the majority of the Israeli population, is used widely in official logos, road signs and product labels. [[Russian language|Russian]], spoken by the large immigrant population from the former [[Soviet Union]], is also heavily used.

Modern Hebrew emerged as a result of the [[revival of the Hebrew language]] that began the late 19th century, and is based on different dialects of [[Biblical Hebrew|ancient Hebrew]] and somewhat influenced by many languages (English, [[Jewish languages]], [[Slavic languages]], [[Arabic]], [[Aramaic]], [[German language|German]] and others).

According to a 2011 [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics|Government]] Social Survey of Israelis over 20 years of age, 49% report Hebrew as their native language, Arabic 18%, [[Russian language|Russian]] 15%, [[Yiddish]] 2%, [[French language|French]] 2%, English 2%,&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/reader/newhodaot/hodaa_template.html?hodaa=201319017 |title=Selected Data from the 2011 Social Survey on Mastery of the Hebrew Language and Usage of Languages (Hebrew Only) |author=[[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] |accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1.6% [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and 10% other languages (including [[Romanian language|Romanian]], German and [[Amharic language|Amharic]], which were not offered as answers by the survey). This study also noted that 90% of [[Israeli Jews|Jews]] and over 60% of [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arabs]] have a good understanding of Hebrew.

==History==

[[File:Beit Hashita.jpg|thumb|An Israeli road sign in Hebrew, Arabic, and English. On some road signs (such as the ones above), the Arabic and English are [[transliteration]]s of the Hebrew place names. On others, the local Arabic or conventional English names are used.]]

Several laws determine the official status of languages and [[language policy]] in Israel. This confusing situation has led to several appeals to the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]], whose rulings have enforced the current policies of national and local authorities.

On 19 July 2018, the [[Knesset]] passed a [[Basic Laws of Israel|basic law]] under the title [[Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People|Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People]], which defines [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as "the State's language" and [[Arabic]] as a language with "a special status in the State" (article 4). The law further says that it should not be interpreted as compromising the status of the Arabic language in practice prior to the enactment of the basic law, namely, it preserves the status quo and changes the status of Hebrew and Arabic only nominally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/world/middleeast/israel-law-jews-arabic.html|title=Israeli Law Declares the Country the ‘Nation-State of the Jewish People’|last=Halbfinger|first=David M.|date=19 July 2018|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-07-24|last2=Kershner|first2=Isabel|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the enactment of the aforementioned basic law, the status of official language in Israel was determined by the 82nd paragraph of the "[[Order in Council]]" issued on [https://web.archive.org/web/20081221030238/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/c7aae196f41aa055052565f50054e656!OpenDocument 14 August 1922], for the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate]], as amended in 1939:&lt;ref&gt;''The Palestine Gazette'', No. 898 of 29 June 1939, Supplement 2, pp. 464–465.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"All Ordinances, official notices and official forms of the Government and all official notices of local authorities and municipalities in areas to be prescribed by order of the High Commissioner, shall be published in English, Arabic and Hebrew."
This law, like most other laws of the British Mandate, was adopted in the State of Israel, subject to certain amendments published by the provisional [[legislative branch]] on 19 May 1948. The amendment states that:
:"Any provision in the law requiring the use of the English language is repealed."&lt;ref name=IL1&gt;Law and Administration Ordinance No 1 of 5708—1948, clause 15(b). Official Gazette No. 1 of 5th Iyar, 5708; as per authorised translation in ''Laws of the State of Israel'', Vol. I (1948) p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official languages==
===Hebrew===
The [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] articles, issued by the Council of the [[League of Nations]] in 1922, and the 1922 Palestine Order in Council were the first in modern times to acknowledge [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as an official language of a political entity. This was a significant achievement for the [[Zionist movement]], which sought to establish [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as the national language of the Jewish people and discouraged the use of other [[Jewish languages]], particularly [[Yiddish]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/mar/05/yiddish-jewish-culture-zionism |title=Yiddish is no joke |author=[[Antony Lerman|Lerman, Anthony]] |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=12 July 2011 |date=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; just like [[Aramaic]] replaced Hebrew in ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Yiddish culture: the story of the Yiddish language movement|author=Goldsmith, Emanuel S.|isbn=0-8232-1695-0|publisher=[[Fordham University Press]]|year=1997|quote=The linguistic dualism between Hebrew and Yiddish was similar to that of Hebrew and Aramaic in former generations.|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQU6Rfv1iskC|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement for [[Revival of the Hebrew language|the revival of Hebrew as a spoken language]] was particularly popular among new Jewish Zionist immigrants who came to [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] ruled [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]] beginning in the 1880s. [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]] (born in the [[Russian Empire]]) and his followers created the first Hebrew-speaking schools, newspapers, and other Hebrew-language institutions. As [[Max Weinreich]] notes in his book, "History of the Yiddish Language, Volume 1", the "very making of Hebrew into a spoken language derives from the will to separate from the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]]".&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Yiddish Language, Volume 1|isbn=0-300-10960-1|year=2008|author=[[Max Weinreich|Weinreich, Max]]|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|page=311|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dodhJPwxg38C|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Ben Yehuda's immigration to Israel, and due to the impetus of the [[Second Aliyah]] (1905–1914), Hebrew prevailed as the single official and spoken language of the Jewish community of [[Mandatory Palestine]]. When the State of Israel was formed in 1948, the government viewed Hebrew as the ''de facto'' official language and initiated a [[melting pot]] policy, where every immigrant was required to study Hebrew and often to adopt a Hebrew surname. Use of Yiddish, which was the main competitor prior to [[World War II]], was discouraged,&lt;ref&gt;As described by the Yiddish-speaking actor Nathan Wolfowicz in the Israeli Yiddish newspaper ''Letzte Naies'' on 20 July 1951. [http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/pages/ShArtTower.jhtml?itemNo=410894&amp;contrassID=nl&amp;nl=31_03 A Hebrew translation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001144004/http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/pages/ShArtTower.jhtml?itemNo=410894&amp;contrassID=nl&amp;nl=31_03 |date=1 October 2007 }} of his article by Rachel Rozhenski appeared in ''[[Haaretz]]'' on 31 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and the number of Yiddish speakers declined as the older generations died out. However, Yiddish is still often used in Ashkenazi [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] communities worldwide, and is sometimes the first language for the members of the Hasidic branches of such communities.

Today, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is the official language used in government, commerce, court sessions, schools, and universities. It is the language most commonly used in everyday life in [[Israel]]. Native Hebrew speakers comprise about 53% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;''The Israeli Conflict System: Analytic Approaches''&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of the rest speak Hebrew fluently as a second language. Native-born Israeli Jews are typically native speakers of Hebrew, but a significant minority of Israelis are immigrants who learned Hebrew as a second language. Immigrants who come under the [[Law of Return]] are entitled to a free course in an [[ulpan]], or Hebrew language school. Most of them speak fluent Hebrew, but some do not. Most [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli-Arabs]], who comprise a large national minority, and members of other minorities are also fluent in Hebrew. Historically, Hebrew was taught in Arab schools from the third grade onward, but it has been gradually introduced from kindergarten onward starting in September 2015. A Hebrew exam is an essential part of the matriculation exams for students of Israeli schools. The state-affiliated [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]], established in 1953 by a Knesset law, is tasked with researching the Hebrew language and offering standardized rules for the use of the language by the state.

A survey by the Central Bureau of Statistics released in 2013 found that 90% of [[Israeli Jews]] were proficient in Hebrew and 70% were highly proficient. It also found that 60% of [[Israeli Arabs]] were proficient or highly proficient in Hebrew, while 17% could not read it and 12% could not speak it.&lt;ref name=ynet&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4335235,00.html |title=CBS: 27% of Israelis struggle with Hebrew |first=Yaron |last=Druckman |date=21 January 2013 |publisher=Ynet News |access-date=15 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic===
{{Main article|Arabic language in Israel}}
[[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]], along with Hebrew, has special status under [[Israeli law]], and was the country's second official language until 2018, when [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] was declared the sole official language. Various spoken dialects are used. Arabic is the native language among [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli-Arabs]]. In 1949, 156,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Sarah Ozacky-Lazar, Relations between Jews and Arabs during Israel&amp;rsquo;s first decade (in Hebrew)|url=http://lib.cet.ac.il/pages/item.asp?item=13336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinian Arabs were left inside Israel’s armistice line, most of whom did not speak Hebrew. Today, the figure stands at about 1.6 million, and although most are proficient in Hebrew, Arabic remains their primary native language.

In addition, a significant number of Israeli Jews know spoken Arabic, although only a very small number are fully literate in written Arabic. Arabic is the native language of older generations of [[Mizrahi Jews]] who immigrated from [[List of countries where Arabic is an official language|Arabic-speaking countries]]. Arabic lessons are widespread in Hebrew-speaking schools from the seventh through ninth grades. Those who wish to do so may opt to continue their Arabic studies through the twelfth grade and take an Arabic matriculation exam. A 2015 study found that 17% of [[Israeli Jews]] can understand Arabic and 10% can speak it fluently, but only 2.5% can read an article in the language, 1.5% can write a letter in it, and 1% can read a book in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.690377|title=Study: Only 1% of Israeli Jews Can Read a Book in Arabic|first=Or|last=Kashti|date=6 December 2015|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years the Israeli authorities were reluctant to use Arabic, except when explicitly ordered by law (for example, in warnings on dangerous chemicals), or when addressing the Arabic-speaking population. This has changed following a November 2000 supreme court ruling which ruled that although second to Hebrew, the use of Arabic should be much more extensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The official text of the Israeli supreme court ruling (in Hebrew)|url=http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/99/120/041/a10/99041120.a10.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, all road signs, food labels, and messages published or posted by the government must also be translated into Literary Arabic, unless being issued by the local authority of an exclusively Hebrew-speaking community. As of December 2017, 40% of digital panels on public buses list their routes in both [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic]] across the country, and, starting in 2015, Arabic has been increasingly featured in signs along highways and in railway stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The sudden, surprising rise of Arabic on Israeli street signs|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21732032-one-area-where-binyamin-netanyahus-government-not-so-hostile-arabs|website=The Economist|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic was always considered a legitimate language for use in the [[Knesset]] alongside Hebrew, but only rarely have Arabic-speaking Knesset members made use of this privilege as while all Arabic-speaking MKs are fluent in Hebrew, fewer Hebrew-speaking MKs can understand Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4226065,00.html|title=MK takes to Knesset podium for speech in Arabic|date=2012-07-05|work=Ynetnews|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/found-in-translation-arabic-language-wins-unexpected-approval-in-knesset/|title=Found in translation: Arabic language wins unexpected approval in Knesset|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, the Knesset approved a new law calling for the establishment of an [[Academy of the Arabic Language in Israel|Arabic Language Academy]] similar to the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]. This institute was established in 2008, its centre is in [[Haifa]] and it is currently headed by Prof. Mahmud Ghanayem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/Laws/Data/law/2092/2092.pdf The law in Hebrew] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223858/http://www.knesset.gov.il/Laws/Data/law/2092/2092.pdf |date=3 March 2016 }} in the Israeli official gazette (publication no. 2092 from 28 March 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arabic Language Academy - Haifa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabicac.com/shownews.php?ID=267 |title=Arabic Language Academy – Haifa |publisher=Arabicac.com |date=21 March 2007 |accessdate=4 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308190044/http://www.arabicac.com/shownews.php?ID=267 |archivedate= 8 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a group of Knesset members proposed a bill to remove Arabic's status as an official language, making it an "official secondary language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/13577/ |title=Knesset Hawks Move To Strip Arabic of Official Status in Israel |work=The Forward |accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.4981833 |title=MKs: Make Hebrew the only official language |last=Ilan |first=Shahar |date=19 May 2008 |website=Haaretz |location=Israel |access-date=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That bill did not pass.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

In 2009, [[Yisrael Katz (politician born 1955)|Israel Katz]], the transport minister, suggested that signs on all major roads in Israel, East Jerusalem and possibly parts of the West Bank would be amended, replacing English and Arabic place names with straight transliterations of the Hebrew name. Currently most road signs are in all three languages. [[Nazareth]], for example, would become "Natzeret".&lt;ref name=cp /&gt; The Transport Ministry said signs would be replaced gradually as necessary due to wear and tear. This has been criticized as an attempt to erase the Arabic language and Palestinian heritage in Israel.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;''[[CounterPunch]]'', 17 July 2009, [http://www.counterpunch.org/cook07172009.html Israeli Road Signs: Wiping Arabic Names Off the Map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613190501/http://counterpunch.org/cook07172009.html |date=13 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc130709&gt;[[BBC]], 13 July 2009, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8148089.stm Row over 'standard' Hebrew signs]&lt;/ref&gt; Israel's governmental names' committee unanimously rejected that suggestion in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politics/1.1179407|title=לשכת רה"מ: הצעת כץ למחוק שמות יישובים בלועזית - לא  ריאלית|last=חסון|first=ניר|date=6 July 2011|newspaper=הארץ|language=he|access-date=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other languages==
===Russian===

[[File:Israel Multilingual sign at beach.jpg|thumb|250px|A multilingual sign at a beach, in Hebrew, English, Arabic and Russian, stating "swimming forbidden".]]
[[Russian language|Russian]] is by far the most widely spoken non-official language in Israel. Over 20% of Israelis are fluent in Russian after mass Jewish immigration from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] ([[Russian Jews in Israel]]) and its [[Former Soviet Union|successor states]] in the 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s. The government and businesses often provide both written and verbal information in Russian. There is also an [[Israel Plus|Israeli television broadcast channel in Russian]]. In addition, some Israeli schools also offer Russian language courses.  The children of Russian immigrants to Israel generally pick up Hebrew as their dominant language, but most still speak Russian, and a majority still use Russian instead of Hebrew with family and Russian-speaking friends.&lt;ref name=spolsky&gt;Spolsky, Bernard: ''The Languages of the Jews: A Sociolinguistic History'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017 there are up to 1.5 million Russian-speaking Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.ru/finansy-i-investicii/340519-rossiysko-izrailskie-ekonomicheskie-svyazi-ne-tolko-neft-na К визиту Нетаньяху: что Россия может получить от экономики Израиля] Алексей Голубович, Forbes Russia, 9 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Jewish immigrants from the [[Soviet Union]] were highly educated{{sfn|Baker|Jones|1998|p=202}} with almost 45 percent of them having some kind of higher education.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=96}} Despite the fact that the native language of a significant part of the country's population is Russian, the language occupies a modest role in Israel's education system. [[Hebrew University]] started teaching Russian in 1962. In public schools, the first Russian-language classes were opened in the 1970s in large cities. The number of students enrolled in these programs dropped in the 1980s as immigration from the Soviet Union slowed down. In the 1990s, a Russian-language program carried out by local governments called ''Na'leh 16'' included some 1,500 students. In 1997, about 120 schools in Israel taught Russian in one way or another.{{sfn|Spolsky|Shohamy|1999|p=238}}

Traditionally, Russian speakers read newspapers and listen to radio more often than Hebrew speakers.{{sfn|Rebhun|Waxman|2004|p=106}} ''Nasha strana'' was the major Russian-newspaper in Israel during the 1970s, when it competed with ''Tribuna'' for the immigrant reader.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=99}} In 1989, there was only one daily in Russian, and 6 in 1996.{{sfn|Spolsky|Shohamy|1999|p=237}} Since the 2000s, the number of Russian-language newspapers started to decline due to the increasing number of television and online media.{{sfn|LeVineShafir|2012|p=317}} Israeli television provides daily translation in Hebrew, Arabic, and Russian.{{sfn|Pokorn|2010|p=117}} In 2002, the Israeli Russian-speaking commercial Channel 9 was launched. It is also known as [[Israel Plus]].{{sfn|LeVineShafir|2012|p=317}} In November 2007, a typical digital package included 45 channels in foreign languages, with 5 in Russian.{{sfn|Pokorn|2010|p=117}} At 2004 there were four dailies, 11 weeklies, five monthlies and over 50 local newspapers published in Russian in Israel, with a total circulation of about 250,000 during weekends.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=99}} Daily radio services in Russian are also available throughout Israel.{{sfn|Baker|Jones|1998|p=202}}

===English===
In 1999, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|High Court of Justice]] ruled that English, Arabic and Hebrew were inherited as official languages by Israel, but that English had been removed by the Law and Administration Ordinance of 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/Files/99/120/041/a10/99041120.a10.HTM High Court of Justice, case 4112/99, paragraphs 11–12]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ordinance said:
:"Any provision in the law requiring the use of the [[English language]] is repealed."&lt;ref name=IL1 /&gt;
In practice the use of English decreased dramatically during the state's early years. At first, [[French language|French]] was used as a diplomatic language, even though most state officials and civil servants were more fluent in English. During the late 1960s, the Israeli-French alliance was undermined, giving way to a stronger Israeli-United States alliance and paving the way for the English language to regain much of its lost status. Today, English is the primary language for international relations and foreign exchange, but it is not sanctioned for use in Knesset debates or in drafting legislation. Some British Mandate laws are still formulated in English, and the process of their translation into Hebrew has been gradual. [[English as a second or foreign language|English is required as a second language]] in schools and universities, for both Hebrew and Arabic-speaking students. Despite the country's history of British mandatory rule, written English in Israel today uses primarily American spelling and grammar.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The usage of the language is influenced by factors related to the birthplace of the speaker or the speaker's ancestors: those who are born to American-descended parentages are more likely to speak [[American English]] as their preferred dialect of the language, Western Continental European descendants are more likely to speak with accents heavily influenced by languages such as French, [[German language|German]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], and so on. A distinctively Israeli dialect of the language has been slow in development due to continued migration to Israel, large established communities of persistent speakers of languages and dialects from outside of Israel, and the state's focus upon education in Hebrew; the development of English in Israel may depend upon the future of assimilation and integration of generations of native-born Israeli citizens as well as the status of Israel's relations with [[English-speaking world|English-speaking countries]] including the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

Although English does not enjoy the same status as Hebrew and Arabic do, English proficiency is a core requirement in the public education system and road signs are generally written in English after Hebrew and Arabic. English is taught in public schools from the third grade to high school, and passing an English oral and written test is a prerequisite for receiving a ''[[Bagrut]]'' (matriculation certificate). Most universities also regard a high level of English as a prerequisite for admission. Exposure to [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] has been massive in Israel since the early 1990s, and in Israel, foreign language television shows are generally presented in the original language with Hebrew subtitles rather than dubbed, which means that there is a high level of exposure to English in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/study-finds-most-english-teachers-lacking-in-english/|title=Study finds most English teachers lacking in English|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-1.637346|title=You're in Israel – Speak English|first=Haim|last=Bior|date=11 February 2018|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/the-biggest-challenges-for-israeli-students-learning-english-how-to-overcome-them/|title=The Biggest Challenges for Israeli Students Learning English: How to Overcome Them?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Most Israelis can converse in and read English on at least a basic level, and secular Israelis who are of a high social and economic status usually possess greater capabilities in English than those who are of a lower social and economic status (this is mostly due to differing levels of state-sponsored education, as well as variation in cultural exposure to the language). Israelis born from the 1980s onward generally have better English language skills than their parents and grandparents due to growing up with a higher level of exposure to the language in the media. Proper usage of the English language is considered a mark of good education among Israelis. In the past, several politicians, including [[David Levy (Israeli politician)|David Levy]] and [[Amir Peretz]], were mocked openly in the media and in public for their poor English skills.

Due to immigration from English-speaking countries, a small but significant minority of Israeli Jews are native English speakers. One survey found that about 2% of Israelis spoke English as their native language.&lt;ref name=ynet/&gt;

[[French language|French]] is spoken by many [[Moroccan Jews in Israel|Moroccan]], Algerian, and Tunisian Jews, either as a native or second language of these [[Francization|francized]] [[Maghreb]]i Jews, French is also spoken by the increasing number of [[French Jews in Israel|new immigrants from France]] and other French-speaking countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.terredisrael.com/ISRAEL_ALYA1.php olim from french speaking countries]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by foreign workers from [[African French|French speaking Africa]].

In practice the use of French decreased dramatically after the state's early years. At first, [[French language|French]] was used as a diplomatic language and French was also used alongside Hebrew on official documents such as [[Israeli passport|passports]] until the 1990s, even though most state officials and civil servants were more fluent in English. Hoewer during the late 1960s, the Israeli-French alliance was undermined, giving way decreased use of French. Israeli passports switched from French to English during the 1990s.

Today, French is still taught in many Israeli schools and universities and due to immigration from France a small but significant 2% of [[Israeli Jews]] are native French speakers.&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt;. The French embassy's ''Institut Français'' supports French studies in Israeli schools. Israel has tried to join [[La Francophonie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ambafrance-uk.org/Israel-and-the-OIF-institutions.html |title=Israel and the OIF institutions |accessdate=6 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620133350/http://ambafrance-uk.org/Israel-and-the-OIF-institutions.html |archivedate=20 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but has been rebuffed by its Arab members. [[Tel Aviv University]] is a member of the [[Agence universitaire de la Francophonie]] (AUF).

===Policy towards immigrants' languages===
The [[melting pot]] policy, which governed the Israel language policy in its early days, was gradually neglected during the late 1970s.  While in the 1950s Israeli law banned Yiddish-language theaters and forced civil servants to adopt Hebrew surnames, the new policy allowed immigrants to communicate with the authorities in their language of origin and encouraged them to keep their original language and culture. This new practice has become evident since the early 1990s with [[Aliyah from the Soviet Union in the 1990s|massive immigration from the former Soviet Union]] and the additional [[Aliyah from Ethiopia|immigration from Ethiopia]] ([[Ethiopian Jews in Israel]]). Israeli authorities began to use Russian and [[Amharic]] extensively when communicating with these new immigrants. During the 1991 [[Gulf War]], warnings and instructions were issued in at least seven languages. In 1991, a new radio station was erected, called "REKA", which is a Hebrew acronym for "Aliyah Absorption Network". At first, it broadcast exclusively in Russian, also containing programming aimed at teaching Hebrew, which included veteran Israel radio broadcasters recapping news in "easy Hebrew"; some years later, Amharic and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]] time slots were introduced. Just as news in Arabic existed on [[Arutz 1]], news programmes appeared in Russian, Amharic and Tigrinya. Several newspapers and magazines were published in Russian and easy Hebrew with [[Niqqud]]. In the beginning of the twenty-first century, [[Channel 9 (Israel)|the first Russian-language TV channel]] was created.

===Other spoken languages===
After Hebrew and Arabic, many other languages are used by large sectors of the Israeli population such as English, Russian, French and many others, including:

* '''[[Romanian language|Romanian]]''': It is estimated that 82,300 first generation and at least&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The Israeli Census Bureau only counts as second generation Jews those persons whose father was born aboard, regardless of their mother's origin&lt;/ref&gt; 126,200 second generation Romanian Jews lived in Israel by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbs.gov.il/reader/shnaton/templ_shnaton_e.html?num_tab=st02_08x&amp;CYear=2013&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it is estimated that 14,700 Romanians nationals worked in Israel as of 2010 (with or without a work permit).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbs.gov.il/hodaot2011n/20_11_182e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These figures do not include Moldovan-born Jews and Moldovan migrants, which in turn are listed as former Soviet. However, these numbers do not account for actual language speakers but only nationality, as there is no recent data on the number of Roumanophones living in Israel.
* '''[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]''': The language of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in Eastern Europe and the second most widely spoken Jewish language, Yiddish is a Germanic language, but incorporates elements of Hebrew. Banned in theatres, movies and other cultural activities during Israel's early statehood, Yiddish has undergone a cultural revival in recent years. Yiddish is the primary language in some [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Ashkenazi communities in Israel. However, despite state-sponsored initiatives for preserving Yiddish culture, the number of Yiddish-speaking Israelis is in decline as older generations of Ashkenazi Jews pass away. In addition, due to greater integration of Haredim, many families in Yiddish-speaking Haredi communities have switched to using primarily Hebrew at home, which has led to these communities to launch preservation campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.813370|title=War on Hebrew - For Some ultra-Orthodox, There Can Be Only One Language|first=Aaron|last=Rabinowitz|date=23 September 2017|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 survey, about 2% of Israelis over the age of 20 recorded Yiddish as their native language.&lt;ref name=ynet/&gt;
* '''[[German language|German]]''' is spoken natively by around 100,000 Israelis. During Ottoman rule and the mandate period, as well as during the first decades of Israeli statehood, German was one of the primary languages of Jews living there. In 1979 a [[Goethe Institute]] branch opened in Tel Aviv. By 2006 increasing numbers of Israelis were studying German, and at the time four Israeli schools offered German as an elective course.&lt;ref&gt;Bartolmai, Evelyne.

''[[Deutsche Welle]]''. 18 June 2006. Retrieved on 11 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Amharic]]''':  Spoken by most of Israel's 130,000 [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]], most of whom arrived in two massive operations transporting tens of thousands of [[Ethiopian Jews in Israel|Ethiopian Jews]] from [[Ethiopia]] to [[Israel]] in [[Operation Moses|1984]] and [[Operation Solomon|1991]], Amharic is often used in government announcements and publications.
* '''[[Georgian language|Georgian]]/[[Judaeo-Georgian]]''': Although most [[Georgian Jews in Israel|Georgian Jewish]] immigrants speak Russian, they converse among themselves in Georgian.
* '''[[Ladino language|Ladino]]''': The [[Sephardi]] Jewish language and the third most widely spoken Jewish language, Ladino is a variant of medieval Spanish, intermixed with Hebrew and with vocabulary from various other languages where Jews emigrated after being expelled from Spain. It is spoken by many [[Sephardi]] Jews. Today there is a state-supported authority for preserving the Ladino culture.
* '''[[Polish language|Polish]]''': Polish was spoken by the large number of [[aliyah|immigrants]] from [[Poland]]. Today, it is somewhat common in Polish ''[[moshav]]ei ovdim'' (workers' settlements) created during the 1940s and 1950s. There are also several thousand Polish Jews living in Israel who immigrated after the [[1968 Polish political crisis]]; most were born and raised in Poland, speak the language fluently amongst themselves, and have made attempts to impart the language to their children.
* '''[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]''': While most Ukrainian Jews speak Russian, there is still a segment of Ukrainian speakers.
* '''[[Spanish language|Spanish]]''': Spanish is spoken by Jews from [[Argentina]] and other [[Olim (Judaism)|olim]] from other Spanish-speaking countries, as well as by some Sephardi groups. Spanish is not restricted to Sephardim, as most [[Argentine Jews in Israel|Argentine Jews]] are actually Ashkenazim. Spanish has never been part of the curriculum in Israel. Only English, French, Arabic, Russian and Italian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Growing Demand for Italian Language Courses in Israel |url=http://www.ambtelaviv.esteri.it/NR/rdonlyres/03680211-B985-457C-9613-19D58E5654C0/0/NI23maggio2003.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722032759/http://www.ambtelaviv.esteri.it/NR/rdonlyres/03680211-B985-457C-9613-19D58E5654C0/0/NI23maggio2003.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General information on courses at Technion (showing italian language courses)|url=http://humanities.technion.ac.il/general_info.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; are taught, in addition to Hebrew, and Spanish is only taught as a foreign language in universities and [[Instituto Cervantes]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} However, the popularity of [[telenovela|soap operas]] from Argentina and Venezuela, broadcast in Spanish with Hebrew subtitles by [[Viva (Israeli TV channel)|Viva]] in the 1990s, has extended a passive understanding of the language to some of the TV viewers.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;''[http://www.haaretz.com/life/arts-leisure/viva-la-telenova-1.66411 Viva la telenova!]'', [[Michal Palti]], [[Haaretz]]. 8 August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]''': Kurdish is spoken by some of the 150,000 [[Kurdish Jews in Israel|Kurdish Jews]], who immigrated from [[Kurdistan]] region. It was a second language of some Jews who lived in the mountains of the Kurdish region while most of them are speaking Jewish Neo-Aramaic.
* '''[[Turkish language|Turkish]]''': Turkish is spoken by some of the 77,000 [[Turkish Jews in Israel|Turkish Jews]] and their families, who immigrated from Turkey in the second half of the 20th century and also by foreign workers. Many of the Turkish speakers in Israel also speak Ladino.

* '''[[Kayla language|Kayla]]''' and '''[[Qwara language|Qwara]]''': These languages are spoken by [[Ethiopian Jews in Israel|Ethiopian Jews]] in addition to [[Amharic language|Amharic]]. Kayla appears to be extinct.
* '''[[Chinese language|Chinese]]''', '''[[Filipino language|Filipino]]''', and '''[[Thai language|Thai]]''':  While spoken by a negligible number of Israeli Jews, Chinese, Tagalog, and Thai have made inroads in Israeli society in recent years due to an influx of non-Jewish immigrants from China, the [[Philippines]], and [[Thailand]]. It is estimated that there are 180,000 such illegal immigrants.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}  Many (though mostly Vietnamese) legally entered the country when Israel opened their doors to "[[boat people]]" from war-torn Southeast Asia in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

'''Conjugation''' has two meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster online dictionary [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conjugation "Conjugation"].&lt;/ref&gt; One meaning is the creation of derived forms of a [[verb]] from basic forms, or [[principal parts]]. It may be affected by [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical gender|gender]], [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[Grammatical voice|voice]], or other language-specific factors. 

The second meaning of the word conjugation is a group of verbs which all have the same pattern of inflections. Thus all those Latin verbs which have 1st singular '''-ō''', 2nd singular '''-ās''', and infinitive '''-āre''' are said to belong to the 1st conjugation, those with 1st singular '''-eō''', 2nd singular '''-ēs''' and infinitive '''-ēre''' belong to the 2nd conjugation, and so on. The number of conjugations of regular verbs is usually said to be four.

The word "conjugation" comes from the Latin ''coniugātiō'', a [[calque]] of the Greek {{lang|grc|συζυγία}} {{grc-transl|συζυγία}}, literally "yoking together (horses into a team)".

For simple verb paradigms, see the appendix pages for [[wikt:Appendix:Latin first conjugation|first conjugation]], [[wikt:Appendix:Latin second conjugation|second conjugation]], [[wikt:Appendix:Latin third conjugation|third conjugation]], and [[wikt:Appendix:Latin fourth conjugation|fourth conjugation]].

==Number of conjugations==
The ancient Romans themselves, beginning with [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] (1st century BC), originally divided their verbs into three conjugations (''coniugationes verbis accidunt tres: prima, secunda, tertia'' "there are three different conjugations for verbs: the first, second, and third" ([[Aelius Donatus|Donatus]]), 4th century A.D.), according to whether the ending of the 2nd person singular had an ''a'', an ''e'' or an ''i'' in it.&lt;ref&gt;Donatus [''Ars Maior''], 10.16.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others, such as [[Marius Plotius Sacerdos|Sacerdos]] (3rd century AD), [[Dositheus Magister|Dositheus]] (4th century A.D.) and [[Priscian]]&lt;ref&gt;Priscian, [http://kaali.linguist.jussieu.fr/CGL/text.jsp?topic=de%20uerbo&amp;ref=2,369,1-547,14 "Liber octauus de uerbo"] (''Corpus Grammaticorum Latinorum'')&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 500 A.D.), recognised four different groups.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Taylor [http://www.persee.fr/doc/hel_0750-8069_1991_num_13_2_2334 "Latin declensions and conjugations: from Varro to Priscian"] ''Historie Épistémologie Langage'' 13.2 (1991), p. 85–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern grammarians&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Gildersleeve and Lodge, 3rd edition (1895), §120.&lt;/ref&gt; generally recognise four conjugations, according to whether their active present infinitive has the ending '''-āre''', '''-ēre''', '''-ere''', or '''-īre''' (or the passive equivalent of these), for example: '''(1) amō, amāre''' "to love", '''(2) videō, vidēre''' "to see", '''(3) regō, regere''' "to rule" and '''(4) audiō, audīre''' "to hear". There are also some verbs of mixed conjugation, having some endings like the 3rd and others like the 4th conjugation, for example, '''capiō, capere''' "to capture" and '''orior, orīrī''' "to arise".

In addition to regular verbs, which belong to one or other of the four conjugations, there are also a few irregular verbs, which have a different pattern of endings. The most important of these is the verb '''sum, esse''' "to be". There also exist [[deponent verb|deponent]] and semi-deponent Latin verbs (verbs with a passive form but active meaning), as well as [[defective verb]]s (verbs in which some of the tenses are missing).

==Principal parts==
The grouping in conjugations is based on the behaviour of the verb in the present system; the stems for other tenses cannot be inferred from the present stem, so several forms of the verb are necessary to be able to produce the full range of forms for any particular verb.

In a [[dictionary]], Latin verbs are therefore listed with four "principal parts" (or fewer for deponent and defective verbs) which allow the reader to deduce the other conjugated forms of the verbs. These are:
# the first person [[grammatical number|singular]] of the [[present tense|present]] indicative active
# the present [[infinitive]] active
# the first person singular of the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] indicative active
# the [[supine]] or, in some grammars, the perfect passive participle, which uses the same stem. (Texts that list the perfect passive participle use the future active participle for intransitive verbs.) Some verbs lack this principal part altogether.

The present infinitive active form tells you what conjugation the verb is in. 

=== First conjugation ===
The first conjugation is characterized by the [[vowel]] ''ā'' and can be recognized by the ''-āre'' ending of the present active infinitive form. The principal parts usually adhere to one of the following patterns:
* perfect has the suffix ''–āvī''. The majority of first-conjugation verbs adhere to this pattern, which is considered to be "regular", for example:
** ''portō'', ''portāre'', ''portāvī'', ''portātum'', "to carry, to bring";
** ''amō'', ''amāre'', ''amāvī'', ''amātum'', "to love, to be fond of";
* perfect has the suffix ''–uī'', for example:
** ''secō'', ''secāre'', ''secuī'', ''sectum'', "to cut, to divide";
** ''fricō'', ''fricāre'', ''fricuī'', ''frictum'', "to rub";
** ''vetō'', ''vetāre'', ''vetuī'', ''vetitum'', "to forbid, to prohibit";
* perfect has the suffix ''–ī'' and vowel lengthening in the stem, for example:
** ''lavō'', ''lavāre'', ''lāvī'', ''lautum'', "to wash, to bathe";
** ''iuvō'', ''iuvāre'', ''iūvī'', ''iūtum'', "to help, to assist";
* perfect is reduplicated, for example:
** ''stō'', ''stāre'', ''stetī'', ''statum'', "to stand";
** ''dō'', ''dare'', ''dedī'', ''datum'', "to give"; this verb is [[#Irregular verbs|irregular]], since except in the 2nd singular (''dā'', ''dās'') the ''a'' is short (''dăre, dătum, dăbō'' etc.)

Deponent verbs in this conjugation all follow the pattern below, which is the passive of the first type above:&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge, ''Latin Grammar'' (1895), §163.&lt;/ref&gt;
:*''arbitror, arbitrārī, arbitrātus sum'' (to think)
:*''cōnor'', ''cōnārī'', ''cōnātus sum'' (to try)
:*''cūnctor, cūnctāri, cūnctātus sum'' (to hesitate)

=== Second conjugation ===
The second conjugation is characterized by the vowel ''ē'', and can be recognized by the ''-eō'' ending of the first person present indicative and the ''-ēre'' ending of the present active infinitive form. The principal parts usually adhere to one of the following patterns:
* perfect has the suffix ''–uī''. Verbs which adhere to this pattern are considered to be "regular". Examples:
** ''terreō, terrēre, terruī, territum'' (to frighten, to deter)
** ''doceō, docēre, docuī, doctum'' (to teach, to instruct)
** ''teneō, tenēre, tenuī, tentum'' (to hold, to keep)
* perfect has the suffix ''–ēvī''. Examples:
** ''dēleō, dēlēre, dēlēvī, dēlētum'' (to destroy, to efface)
** ''cieō, ciēre, cīvī, citum'' (to arouse, to stir)
* perfect has the suffix ''–sī'' (which combines with a preceding ''c'' or ''g'' to ''–xī''). Examples:
** ''augeō, augēre, auxī, auctum'' (to increase, to enlarge)
** ''iubeō, iubēre, iussī, iussum'' (to order, to bid)
* perfect is reduplicated with ''–ī''. Examples:
** ''mordeō, mordēre, momordī, morsum'' (to bite, to nip)
** ''spondeō, spondēre, spopondī, spōnsum'' (to vow, to promise)
* perfect has suffix ''–ī'' and vowel lengthening in the stem. Examples:
** ''videō, vidēre, vīdī, vīsum'' (to see, to notice)
** ''foveō, fovēre, fōvī, fōtum'' (to caress, to cherish)
* perfect has suffix ''–ī'' and no perfect passive participle. Examples:
** ''strīdeō, strīdēre, strīdī'' (to hiss, to creak)
** ''ferveō, fervēre, fervī'' (sometimes ''fervuī'' or ''ferbuī'') (to boil, to seethe)

Deponent verbs in this conjugation are few. They mostly go like the passive of ''terreō'', but ''fateor'' and ''confiteor'' have a perfect participle with ''ss'':&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge, ''Latin Grammar'' (1895), §164.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* ''mereor, merērī, meritus sum'' (to deserve)
:* ''polliceor, pollicērī, pollicitus sum'' (to promise)
:* ''fateor, fatērī, fassus sum'' (to confess)

=== Third conjugation ===
The third conjugation is characterized by a short thematic vowel, which alternates between ''e'', ''i'', and ''u'' in different environments. Verbs of this conjugation end in ''–ere'' in the present active infinitive. There is no regular rule for constructing the perfect stem of third-conjugation verbs, but the following patterns are used:
* perfect has suffix ''–sī'' (''–xī'' when ''c'' or ''h'' comes at the end of the root). Examples:
** ''carpō, carpere, carpsī, carptum'' (to pluck, to select)
** ''trahō, trahere, trāxī, trāctum'' (to drag, to draw)
** ''gerō, gerere, gessī, gestum'' (to wear, to bear)
** ''flectō, flectere, flexī, flexum'' (to bend, to twist)
* perfect is reduplicated with suffix ''–ī''. Examples:
** ''currō, currere, cucurrī, cursum'' (to run, to race)
** ''caedō, caedere, cecīdī, caesum'' (to kill, to slay)
** ''tangō, tangere, tetigī, tāctum'' (to touch, to hit)
** ''pellō, pellere, pepulī, pulsum'' (to beat, to drive away)
* perfect has suffix ''-vī''. Examples:
** ''petō, petere, petīvī, petītum'' (to seek, to attack)
** ''linō, linere, līvī, lītum'' (to smear, to befoul)
** ''serō, serere, sēvī, satum'' (to sow, to plant)
** ''terō, terere, trīvī, trītum'' (to rub, to wear out)
** ''sternō, sternere, strāvī, strātus'' (to spread, to stretch out)
* perfect has suffix ''–ī'' and vowel lengthening in the stem. Examples:
** ''agō, agere, ēgī, āctum'' (to do, to drive)
** ''legō, legere, lēgī, lēctum'' (to collect, to read)
** ''emō, emere, ēmī, ēmptum'' (to buy, to purchase)
** ''vincō, vincere, vīcī, victum'' (to conquer, to master)
** ''fundō, fundere, fūdī, fūsum'' (to pour, to utter)
* perfect has suffix ''–ī'' only. Examples:
** ''īcō, īcere, īcī, īctum'' (to strike, to smite)
** ''vertō, vertere, vertī, versum'' (to turn, to alter)
** ''vīsō, vīsere, vīsī, vīsum'' (to visit)
* perfect has suffix ''–uī''. Examples:
** ''metō, metere, messuī, messum'' (to reap, to harvest)
** ''vomō, vomere, vomuī, vomitum'' (to vomit)
** ''colō, colere, coluī, cultum'' (to cultivate, to till)
** ''texō, texere, texuī, textum'' (to weave, to plait)
** ''gignō, gignere, genuī, genitum'' (to beget, to cause)
* Present tense indicative first person singular form has suffix with ''–scō''. Examples:
** ''nōscō, nōscere, nōvī, nōtum'' (to get to know, to learn)
** ''adolēscō, adolēscere, adolēvī'' (to grow up, to mature)
** ''flōrēscō, flōrēscere, flōruī'' (to begin to flourish, to blossom)
** ''haerēscō, haerēscere, haesī, haesum'' (to adhere, to stick)
** ''pāscō, pāscere, pāvī, pāstum'' (to feed upon, to feed (an animal))

Deponent verbs in the 3rd conjugation include the following:
:*''lābor, lābī, lāpsus sum'' (to glide)
:*''loquor, loquī, locūtus sum'' (to speak)
:*''oblīvīscor, oblīvīscī, oblītus sum'' (to forget)
:*''sequor, sequī, secūtus sum'' (to follow)
:*''ūtor, ūtī, ūsus sum'' (to use)

===Third conjugation –iō verbs===
Intermediate between the third and fourth conjugation are the [[#Third conjugation –iō verbs|third-conjugation verbs with suffix ''–iō'']]. These resemble the fourth conjugation in some forms. Some examples are:
:*''capiō, capere, cēpī, captum'' (to take, capture)
:*''faciō, facere, fēcī, factum'' (to do, to make)
:*''rapiō, rapere, rapuī, raptum'' (to plunder, seize)
:*''cupiō, cupere, cupīvī, cupītum'' (to desire, long for)

Deponent verbs in this group include:
:*''morior, morī, mortuus sum'' (to die)
:*''patior, patī, passus sum'' (to suffer, to allow)
:*''aggredior, aggredī, aggressus sum'' (to attack)

They resemble the fourth conjugation in the following parts of the verb:

:Present indicative (first person singular, third person plural): ''capiō, capiunt''.
:Indicative imperfect: ''capiēbam, capiēbāmus''.
:Indicative future: ''capiam, capiēmus''.
:Subjunctive present: ''capiam, capiāmus''
:Imperative future (third person plural): ''capiuntō''
:Present Active Participle: ''capiēns, -entis''
:Gerund: ''capiendī, capiendum'' (also ''capiundī'')
:Gerundive: ''capiendus, –a, –um'' (also ''capiundus'')

=== Fourth conjugation ===
The fourth conjugation is characterized by the vowel ''ī'' and can be recognized by the ''–īre'' ending of the present active infinitive. Principal parts of verbs in the fourth conjugation generally adhere to the following patterns:
* perfect has suffix ''–vī''. Verbs which adhere to this pattern are considered to be "regular". Examples:
** ''audiō, audīre, audīvī, audītum'' (to hear, listen (to))
** ''mūniō, mūnīre, mūnīvī, mūnītum'' (to fortify, to build)
* perfect has suffix ''–uī''. Examples:
** ''aperiō, aperīre, aperuī, apertum'' (to open, to uncover)
* perfect has suffix ''–sī'' (''-xī'' when ''c'' comes at the end of the root). Examples:
** ''saepiō, saepīre, saepsī, saeptum'' (to surround, to enclose)
** ''sanciō, sancīre, sānxī, sānctum'' (to confirm, to ratify)
** ''sentiō, sentīre, sēnsī, sēnsum'' (to feel, to perceive)
* perfect has suffix ''–ī'' and vowel lengthening in the stem. Examples:
** ''veniō, venīre, vēnī, ventum'' (to come, to arrive)

Deponent verbs in the 4th conjugation include the following:&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge ''Latin Grammar'' (1985), §166.&lt;/ref&gt;
:*''assentior, assentīrī, assēnsus sum'' (to assent)
:*''largior, largīrī, largītus sum'' (to bestow)
:*''mentior, mentīrī, mentītus sum'' (to tell a lie)
:*''mētior, mētīrī, mēnsus sum'' (to measure)
:*''sortior, sortīrī, sortītus sum'' (to cast lots)

The verb ''orior, orīrī, ortus sum'' (to arise) is also regarded as 4th conjugation, although some parts, such as the 3rd singular present tense ''oritur'' and imperfect subjunctive ''orerer'', have a short vowel like the 3rd conjugation. But its compound ''adorior'' (to rise up, attack) is entirely 4th conjugation.

== Personal endings ==
Personal endings are used in all tenses. The present, imperfect, future, pluperfect and future perfect use the same personal endings in the active voice. The perfect has its own endings. In the perfect, future perfect, and pluperfect passive, the tenses are formed from a perfect participle and the appropriate part of ''sum'', e.g. ''portātus sum'' 'I was carried'.

The third person plural alternative ending ''-ēre'' is common in poetry, but not often used in prose.

The 2nd person singular passive alternative ending ''-re'' can be used in the future and imperfect, but not usually in the present, where there might be confusion with the infinitive (''portāre''). In early Latin ''-re'' was the most usual form.&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1903), ''Gildersleeve's Latin Grammar'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present-tense system ==
The tenses of the present-tense system are the present, imperfect, and future tenses. As examples, the following verbs will be used here:
* the first conjugation verb ''portō, portāre, portāvī, portātum'' (to carry, to bring)
* the second conjugation verb ''terreō, terrēre, terruī, territum'' (to frighten, to deter)
* the third conjugation verb ''petō, petere, petīvī, petītum'' (to seek, to attack)
* the fourth conjugation verb ''audiō, audīre, audīvī, audītum'' (to hear, to listen (to))

In all the conjugations except for the third conjugation, the ''–re'' is removed from the second principal part (for example, ''portāre'' without the suffix ''–re'' becomes ''portā–'') to form the present stem, which is used for all of the tenses in the imperfective aspect. In the third conjugation, the ''–ō'' ending of the present indicative is dropped in order to form the present stem (for example, the present indicative form of ''petere'' is ''petō'', and without the ''-ō'' it is the present stem, ''pet–'').&lt;ref name="jenney_firstyear"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenney|first=Charles |author2=Roger Scudder |author3=Eric C. Baade|title=First Year Latin|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|year=1979|pages=123|isbn=0-205-07859-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, the terminating vowel of the stem is lengthened and/or shortened, and sometimes completely changed. This is often true both in the third conjugation and in the subjunctive mood of all conjugations.

=== Present tense ===
The present tense (Latin ''tempus praesēns'') is used to show an uncompleted action that happens in the current time. The present tense does not have a tense sign. Instead, the personal endings are added to the bare present stem. However, in this tense the thematic vowel, most notably the ''ě'' in the third conjugation, changes the most frequently.

==== Present indicative ====
A present tense like ''portō'' can be translated as "I carry," "I do carry," or "I am carrying". In all but the third conjugation, the thematic vowel of the stem is used. In the third conjugation, the linking vowel varies between ''e'', ''i'' and ''u''. The first person singular of the indicative active present is the first principal part of the verb.

|}

==== Present subjunctive ====
The present subjunctive ''portem'' can be translated as "I may carry", "I would carry", "I should carry", "May I carry", "Let me carry", or in subordinate clauses simply as "I carry". ''Portēmus'' can be "Let us carry".

The vowels of the verb endings in the present subjunctive differ from the indicative:
*The first conjugation uses ''e'' or ''ē'' instead of ''ā''.
*The second conjugation uses ''ea'' and ''eā''.
*The third conjugation uses ''a'' or ''ā''.
*The fourth conjugation uses ''ia'' or ''iā''.

The passive subjunctive ''porter'' can be translated as "I may be carried", "I would be carried", "I should be carried", "Let me be carried", "May I be carried" or in subordinate clauses simply as "I am carried". ''Portēmur'' can be "Let us be carried".

|}

==== Present imperative ====
The present imperative conveys commands, pleas and recommendations. ''Portā'' can be translated as "(You) Carry" or simply, "Carry". The imperative present occurs only in the second person.
*The second person singular in the active voice uses only the bare stem, and does not add an imperative ending.

|}

The imperative present of the passive voice is rarely used, except in the case of deponent verbs, whose passive forms carry active meaning. ''Portāminī'' can be translated as "(You) Be carried".  The deponent ''sequiminī'', on the other hand, means "(You) Follow!".
*The singular uses the alternate form of the present passive indicative (which looks like the present active infinitive) and the plural uses the present passive indicative form of the second person plural.

=== Imperfect ===
The imperfect (Latin ''tempus praeteritum imperfectum'') indicates a perpetual, but incomplete action in the past. It is recognized by the tense signs ''bă'' and ''bā'' in the indicative, and ''re'' and ''rē'' in the subjunctive.

==== Imperfect indicative ====
The imperfect indicative simply expresses an action in the past that was not completed. ''Portābam'' can be translated to mean, "I was carrying," "I carried," or "I used to carry".
*In the indicative, the imperfect employs its tense signs ''ba'' and ''bā'' before personal endings are added.

|}

As with the present tense, active personal endings are taken off, and passive personal endings are put in their place. ''Portābar'' can be translated as "I was being carried," "I kept being carried," or "I used to be carried".

|}

==== Imperfect subjunctive ====
In the subjunctive, the imperfect is quite important, especially in subordinate clauses. Independently, it is largely translated conditionally. ''Portārem'' can mean, "I should carry," or "I would carry".
*Unlike the indicative, the subjunctive does not modify the thematic vowel. The third conjugation's thematical remains short as an ''e'', and the fourth conjugation does not use an ''iē'' before the imperfect signs. It keeps its ''ī''.
*In the subjunctive, the imperfect employs its tense signs ''re'' and ''rē'' before personal endings.
*The verb ''esse'' (to be) has two imperfect subjunctives: one using the present infinitive (''essem, esses, esset, essemus, essetis, essent'') and one using the future infinitive (''forem, fores, foret, foremus, foretis, forent'').

As with the indicative subjunctive, active endings are removed, and passive endings are added. ''Portārer'' may be translated as "I should be carried," or "I would be carried."

|}

=== Future tense ===
The future tense (Latin ''tempus futūrum simplex'') expresses an uncompleted action in the future. It is recognized by its tense signs ''bō'', ''bi'', ''bu'', ''a'' and ''ē'' in the indicative and the vowel ''ō'' in the imperative mood.

==== Future indicative ====
The future tense always refers to an incomplete action. In addition, the future tense is stricter in usage temporally in Latin than it is in English. Standing alone, ''portābō'' can mean, "I shall carry," or "I will carry."
*The first and second conjugations append ''-b-'' and then add ''third'' conjugation present endings.
*The third and fourth conjugations replace their thematic vowels with ''a'', ''ě'' and ''ē''. The fourth conjugation inserts an ''ǐ'' before the ''a'', ''e'' and ''ē''.

|}

==== Future imperative ====
The future imperative is used to instruct someone to do something at a later time, or if something else happens first (e.g. "write (''scrībitō'') to me if anything happens"). It can also be used in recipes. The 3rd person is mainly used in laws (e.g. "censors shall hold (''habentō'') office for five years").&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1903), ''Gildersleeve's Latin Grammar'' p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; A few verbs, such as ''mementō'' "remember" and ''scītō'' "know", use this form as their only imperative.

''Portātō'' can be translated as "carry" or "you should carry".

The ending ''-or'' marks the passive voice in the future imperative. ''Portātor'' translates as "You shall be carried." The second person plural is exceptionally rare and only occurs in Plautus with select deponent verbs: ''arbitrāminō'', ''opperīminō'', and not attested with any second conjugation verbs at all.

== Perfect-tense system ==
The tenses of the perfect system, which are the '''perfect''', '''pluperfect''' and '''future perfect''' tenses, are used to express actions that have been, had been, or will have been completed. The verbs used for explanation are:

:'''1st conjugation:''' ''portō, portāre, portāvī, portātum'' – to carry, bring
:'''2nd conjugation:''' ''terreō, terrēre, terruī, territum'' – to frighten, deter
:'''3rd conjugation:''' ''petō, petere, petīvī, petītum'' – to seek, attack
:'''4th conjugation:''' ''audiō, audīre, audīvī, audītum'' – to hear, listen (to)

To find the stem for the three perfect tenses active in all of the conjugations, the ''–ī'' is removed from the 3rd principal part. For example, from ''portāvī'', ''portāv-'' is formed.  

Deponent and passive verbs, however, use the perfect passive participle together with part of the verb ''esse'' "to be" to make the perfect tenses. The participle is formed by taking the 4th principal part and changing the ending to the appropriate gender and number, e.g. ''audītus est'' "he was heard", ''audītī sunt'' "they were heard". 

Unlike the present-system tenses, inflection is the same in every conjugation.

=== Perfect ===
The perfect (Latin ''tempus praeteritum perfectum'') refers to an action completed in the past. Tense signs are only used in this tense with the indicative. The tense signs of the subjunctive are ''eri'' and ''erī''.

==== Perfect indicative ====
The indicative perfect expresses a finished action in the past. ''Portāvī'' is translated as "I carried," "I did carry," or "I have carried."
*The perfect indicative perfect in the active voice has its special personal endings which are not used with any other tense.

|}
Note the participle changes from singular to plural when the subject changes respectively. The participle must also be declined for gender in the same way as an adjective.

==== Perfect subjunctive ====
Like the imperfect subjunctive, the perfect subjunctive is largely used in subordinate clauses. Independently, it is usually translated as the potential subjunctive (''quis crediderit?'' 'who would have believed it?/who would believe it?') With ''nē'' it makes a negative command: ''nē timuerītis'' "do not fear". In subordinate clauses such as indirect questions, ''portāverim'' usually means "I carried" or "I have carried". &lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve &amp; Lodge (1903), ''Gildersleeve's Latin Grammar'', pp. 173, 318–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pluperfect ===
The pluperfect (Latin ''tempus praeteritum plūsquamperfectum'') expresses an action which was completed before another completed action. It is recognized by the tense signs ''era'' and ''erā'' in the indicative and ''isse'' and ''issē'' in the subjunctive.

==== Pluperfect indicative ====
As with English, in Latin, the pluperfect indicative is used to assert an action that was completed before another (perfect). ''Portāveram'' translates as "I had carried."
*The tense sign ''erā'' is employed before adding the personal endings, with the long ā following the usual rules for shortening before final -m, -t, and -nt.

|}

In the passive voice, the perfect passive participle is used with ''esse'' in the imperfect indicative. ''Portātus eram'' is translated as "I had been carried."

|}

==== Pluperfect subjunctive ====
The pluperfect subjunctive is to the perfect subjunctive as the imperfect subjunctive is to the present subjunctive. Simply put, it is used with the perfect subjunctive in subordinate clauses. Like the imperfect subjunctive, it is translated conditionally independently. ''Portāvissem'' is translated as "I should have carried," or "I would have carried."
*The tense signs ''isse'' and ''issē'' are used before the personal endings.

|}

As always, the passive voice uses the perfect passive participle. The imperfect subjunctive of ''esse'' is used here. ''Portātus essem'' may mean "I should have been carried," or "I could have been carried," in the conditional sense.

=== Future perfect ===
Probably the least used of all the tenses, the future perfect (Latin ''tempus futūrum exāctum'') conveys an action that will have been completed before another action. It is signified by the tense signs ''erō'' and ''eri''. The future perfect is the only tense that occurs in a single mood.

==== Future perfect indicative ====
As said, the future perfect is used to mention an action that will have been completed in futurity before another action. It is often used with the future tense. In simple translation, ''portāverō'' means, "I will have carried," or "I shall have carried."

*The tense signs ''erō'' and ''eri'' or ''erī'' are used before the personal endings.

Endings with short -i- (e.g. ''portāveris, portāverimus, portāveritis'') are found in the 2nd singular and 1st and 2nd person plural in some authors, e.g. Terence, ''Eunuchus'' 592, but Cicero and Catullus preferred the form with long -i-, e.g. Catullus 5.10 (with Fordyce's note).

As with all perfective aspect tenses, the perfect passive participle is used in the passive voice. However, the future perfect uses the future indicative of ''esse'' as the auxiliary verb. ''Portātus erō'' is "I will have been carried," or "I shall have been carried."

== Non-finite forms ==
The non-finite forms of verbs are participles, infinitives, supines, gerunds and gerundives. The verbs used are:

:'''1st conjugation:''' ''portō, portāre, portāvī, portātum'' – to carry, bring
:'''2nd conjugation:''' ''terreō, terrēre, terruī, territum'' – to frighten, deter
:'''3rd conjugation:''' ''petō, petere, petīvī, petītum'' – to seek, attack
:'''4th conjugation:''' ''audiō, audīre, audīvī, audītum'' – to hear, listen (to)

=== Participles {{anchor|The participles}} ===
{{See also|Participle|Latin syntax#Participles}}

There are four participles: present active, perfect passive, future passive, and future active.
*The '''present active participle''' is declined like a [[Latin declension#Third declension adjectives with one ending|third declension adjective with one ending]].
**In the first and second conjugations, the present active is formed by taking the present stem and adding an ''–ns''. The genitive singular form adds an ''–ntis'', and the thematicals ''ā'' and ''ē'' are shortened.
**In the third conjugation, the ''e'' of the present stem is lengthened. In the genitive, the ''ē'' is short again.
**In the fourth conjugation, the ''ī'' is shortened, and an ''ē'' is placed. Of course, this ''ē'' is short in the genitive.
**''Puer portāns'' translates into "carrying boy."
*The '''perfect passive participle''' is declined like a [[Latin declension#First and second declension adjectives|first and second declension adjective]].
**In all conjugations, the perfect participle is formed by removing the ''–um'' from the supine, and adding a ''–us'' (masculine nominative singular).
**''Puer portātus'' translates into "carried boy."
*The '''future active participle''' is declined like a [[Latin declension#First and second declension adjectives|first and second declension adjective]].
**In all conjugations the ''–um'' is removed from the supine, and an ''–ūrus'' (masculine nominative singular) is added.
**''Puer portātūrus'' translates into "boy going to carry," or "boy who is going to carry."
*The '''future passive participle''' is formed by taking the present stem, adding "-nd-", and then the adjective ending "-us, -a, -um".  Thus "laudare" forms "laudandus".
**The literal translation is "about to be praised", but this often extends a sense of obligation, thus "must be praised".  Thus the "future passive participle" is often cross-listed as the "gerundive" (see below).

=== Infinitives {{anchor|The infinitives}} ===
{{See also|Infinitive|Latin syntax#The infinitive}}

There are six infinitives. They are in the present active, present passive, perfect active, perfect passive, future active and future passive.
*The '''present active infinitive''' is the second principal part (in regular verbs). It plays an important role in the syntactic construction of [[Accusative and infinitive|''Accusativus cum infinitivo'']], for instance.
**''Portāre'' means, "to carry."
*The '''present passive infinitive''' is formed by adding a ''–rī'' to the present stem. This is only so for the first, second and fourth conjugations. In the third conjugation, the thematical vowel, ''e'', is taken from the present stem, and an ''–ī'' is added.
**''Portārī'' translates into "to be carried."
*The '''perfect active infinitive''' is formed by adding an ''–isse'' onto the perfect stem.
**''Portāvisse'' translates into "to have carried."
*The '''perfect passive infinitive''' uses the perfect passive participle along with the auxiliary verb ''esse''. The perfect passive infinitive must agree with what it is describing in number and gender.
**''Portātus esse'' means, "to have been carried."
*The '''future active infinitive''' uses the future active participle with the auxiliary verb ''esse.''
**''Portātūrus esse'' means, "to be going to carry." The future active infinitive must agree with what it is describing in number and gender.
**''Esse'' has two future infinitives: ''futurus esse'' and ''fore'' (''fore'' is mostly used in a substitute expression for the Future Passive Infinitive)
*The '''future passive infinitive''' uses the supine with the auxiliary verb ''īrī''.
**''Portātum īrī'' is translated as "to be going to be carried." This is normally used in indirect speech. For example: ''Omnēs senātōres dīxērunt templum conditum īrī.'' "All of the senators said that a temple would be built."

|}

The Future Passive Infinitive was actually not very commonly used ([[Wheelock's Latin]] mentions it exists but makes it a point to avoid using it in any practice examples).  In practice, the Romans themselves often used an alternate expression, "''fore ut''" followed by a subjunctive clause.

=== Supine {{anchor|The supine}} ===
{{See also|Supine|Latin syntax#The supine}}

The supine is the fourth principal part of the verb, as given in Latin dictionaries. It resembles a masculine noun of the [[Latin declension#Fourth declension (u)|fourth declension]]. Supines only occur in the accusative and ablative cases.
*The accusative form ends in a ''–um'', and is used with a verb of motion in order to show purpose. Thus it is only used with verbs like ''īre'' "to go", ''venīre'' "to come", etc. The accusative form of a supine can also take an object if needed.
**''Pater vēnit '''portātum''' līberōs suōs.'' – The father came to carry his children.
*The ablative, which ends in a ''–ū'', is used with the Ablative of Specification.
**''Arma haec facillima '''portātū''' erant.'' – These arms were the easiest to carry.

=== Gerund {{anchor|The gerund}} ===
{{See also|Gerund|Latin syntax#The gerund}}

The gerund is formed similarly to the present active participle. However, the ''–ns'' becomes an ''–ndus'', and the preceding ''ā'' or ''ē'' is shortened. Gerunds are neuter nouns of the [[Latin declension#Second declension (o)|second declension]], but the nominative case is not present. The gerund is a noun, meaning "the act of doing (the verb)", and forms a suppletive paradigm to the infinitive, which cannot be declined. For example, the genitive form ''portandī'' can mean "of carrying", the dative form ''portandō'' can mean "to carrying", the accusative form ''portandum'' can mean "carrying", and the ablative form ''portandō'' can mean "by carrying", "in respect to carrying", etc.

|-

|}

One common use of the gerund is with the preposition ''ad'' to indicate purpose. For example, ''paratus ad oppugnandum'' could be translated as "ready to attack". However the gerund was avoided when an object was introduced, and a passive construction with the gerundive was preferred. For example, for "ready to attack the enemy" the construction ''paratus ad hostes oppugnandos'' is preferred over ''paratus ad hostes oppugnandum''.&lt;ref name="eitrem"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eitrem|first=S.|title=Latinsk grammatikk|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|year=2006|edition=3|pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gerundive &lt;span id="The gerundive"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ===
{{see|Latin syntax#The gerundive}}

The [[gerundive]] has a form similar to that of the gerund, but it is a [[Latin declension|first and second declension adjective]], and functions as a future passive participle (see {{slink||Participles}} above). It means "(which is) to be ...ed". Often, the gerundive is used with an implicit ''esse'', to show obligation.

*''Puer portandus'' "The boy to be carried"
*''Oratio laudanda est'' means "The speech is to be praised". In such constructions a substantive in dative may be used to identify the agent of the obligation (''dativus auctoris''), as in ''Oratio '''nobis''' laudanda est'' meaning "The speech is to be praised '''by us'''" or "'''We''' must praise the speech".

== Periphrastic conjugations ==
There are two [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] conjugations. One is active, and the other is passive.

=== Active ===
The first periphrastic conjugation uses the future participle. It is combined with the forms of ''esse''. It is translated as "I am going to carry," "I was going to carry", etc.

== Peculiarities ==
===Irregular verbs===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Latin conjugation]] --&gt;
There are a few irregular verbs in Latin that are not grouped into a particular conjugation (such as ''esse'' and ''posse''), or deviate slightly from a conjugation (such as ''ferre, īre,'' and ''dare''). It consists of the following list and their compounds (such as ''conferre''). Many irregular verbs lack a fourth principal part.

:''sum, [[wikt:sum#Latin|esse]], fuī, futūrum{{ref|fore}}'' – to be, exist
:''possum, [[wikt:possum#Latin|posse]]{{ref|potesse}}, potuī'' – to be able, can
:''eō, [[wikt:eo#Latin|īre]], īvī / īī, ītum'' – to go
:''volō, [[wikt:volo#Latin|velle]], voluī'' – to wish, want
:''nōlō, [[wikt:nolo#Latin|nōlle]], nōluī'' – not to want, refuse
:''mālō, [[wikt:malo#Latin|mālle]], māluī'' – to prefer
:''ferō, [[wikt:fero#Latin|ferre]], tulī, lātum'' – to bear, endure, carry, bring
:''fīō, [[wikt:fio#Latin|fierī]], factus sum'' – to become, happen, be made
:''edō, [[wikt:edo#Latin|ēsse]], ēdī, ēsum'' – to eat, waste
:''dō, [[wikt:do#Latin|dare]], dedī, datum'' – to give, bestow

Of these, ''esse'', ''ferre'', and ''fierī'' are [[suppletive]], that is, their deviating third and fourth principal parts reflect what was an entirely different verb historically (in [[Proto-Indo-European]]).

The various parts of these verbs go as follows:

*The verb ''sum'' "I am":
::Present: '''sum, es, est, sumus, estis, sunt''' "I am"
::Future: '''erō, eris, erit, erimus, eritis, erunt''' "I will be"
::Imperfect: '''eram, erās, erat, erāmus, erātis, erant''' "I was"
::Present subjunctive: '''sim, sīs, sit, sīmus, sītis, sint''' "I may be, I would be, I am"
::Imperfect subjunctive: '''essem, essēs, esset, essēmus, essētis, essent''' "I would be, I should be, I was"
::Perfect: '''fuī, -istī, -it...''' "I was", "I have been"
::Infinitive '''esse''' "to be"

*''Possum'' "I am able":
::Present: '''possum, potes, potest, possumus, potestis, possunt''' "I am able"

::Imperfect subjunctive: '''possem, possēs, posset, possēmus, possētis, possent'''
::Perfect: '''potuī, -istī, -it...'''
::Infinitive: '''posse''' "to be able"

*''Eō'' "I go" goes as follows:
::Present: '''eō, īs, it, īmus, ītis, eunt''' "I go"
::Future: '''ībō, ībis, ībit...'''
::Imperfect: '''ībam, ībās, ībat...'''

::Present participle: '''iēns''' (pl. '''euntēs''')

''Abeō'' "I go away", ''adeō'' "I go up to", ''redeō'' "I go back" etc. have similar endings.

*''Volō'' "I want" is an irregular 3rd conjugation verb:
::Present: '''volō, vīs, vult, volumus, vultis, volunt''' "I want"
::Future: '''volam, -ēs, -et...'''
::Imperfect: '''volēbam...'''
::Present subjunctive: '''velim, -īs, -it...'''

::Other forms are similar to ''volō'' above.

*''Mālō'' "I prefer"
::Present: '''mālō, māvīs, māvult, mālumus, māvultis, mālunt''' "I prefer"
::Infinitive: '''mālle''' "to prefer"

::Future: '''dabō...'''
::Imperfect: '''dabam...'''
::Present subjunctive: '''dem, dēs, det...'''

*''Ferō'' "I bring" or "I bear" is like 3rd conjugation verbs, but has certain forms where the short "i" or "e" is omitted. The Perfect ''tulī'' "I brought", and the Perfect passive ''latus sum'' "I was brought" are also irregular:
::Present: '''ferō, fers, fert, ferimus, fertis, ferunt''' "I bring"
::Imperfect subjunctive: '''ferrem...''' "I would bring, I should bring, I was bringing"
::Perfect: '''tulī''' "I brought"

::Imperative: '''fer!''' (pl. '''ferte!''') "bring!"
::Present participle: '''ferēns''' (pl. '''ferentēs''') "bringing"

*''Fīō'' "I happen," "I am done," or "I become," is used instead of the passive form of ''faciō'' "I make."

::Future: '''fīam, fīēs, fīet...'''
::Imperfect: '''fiēbam...'''

::Imperfect Subjunctive: '''fierem, fierēs, fieret...'''
::Infinitive: '''fierī''' "to happen"
::Imperative: '''fī''' (pl. '''fīte''')
::The perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect forms use ''facts sum'' and conjugate regularly, e.g. ''factus erat'' "it has become" and ''factī erimus'' "we will have become."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wheelock |first=Frederic |year=2011 |title=Wheelock's Latin |publisher=HarperCollins |publication-place=New York |page=304 |isbn=978-0-06-199722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deponent and semi-deponent verbs ===
[[Deponent verb]]s are verbs that are passive in form (that is, conjugated as though in the [[passive voice]]) but active in meaning.  These verbs have only three principal parts, since the perfect of ordinary passives is formed [[periphrasis|periphrastically]] with the perfect participle, which is formed on the same stem as the supine. Some examples coming from all conjugations are:

:'''1st conjugation:''' ''mīror, [[wikt: mirari|mīrārī]], mīrātus sum'' – to admire, wonder
:'''2nd conjugation:''' ''polliceor, [[wikt: polliceri|pollicērī]], pollicitus sum'' – to promise, offer
:'''3rd conjugation:''' ''loquor, [[wikt: loqui|loquī]], locūtus sum'' – to speak, say
:'''4th conjugation:''' ''[[wikt: mentior| mentior]], mentīrī, mentītus sum'' – to tell a lie

Deponent verbs use active conjugations for tenses that do not exist in the passive: the [[gerund]], the [[supine]], the present and [[future participle]]s and the future infinitive. They cannot be used in the passive themselves (except the gerundive), and their analogues with "active" form do not in fact exist: one cannot directly translate "The word is said" with any form of ''loquī'', and there are no forms like ''loquō'', ''loquis'', ''loquit'', etc.

Semi-deponent verbs form their imperfective aspect tenses in the manner of ordinary active verbs; but their perfect tenses are built periphrastically like deponents and ordinary passives; thus, semi-deponent verbs have a perfect active participle instead of a perfect passive participle. An example:

:''audeō, audēre, ausus sum'' – to dare, venture

Unlike the proper passive of active verbs, which is always intransitive, some deponent verbs are [[transitive verb|transitive]], which means that they can take an [[object (grammar)|object]]. For example:

:''Eo die quo consueverat intervallo hostes sequitur.'' – That day he follows the enemy at his usual distance.

Note: In the [[Romance languages]], which lack deponent or passive verb forms, the Classical Latin deponent verbs either disappeared (being replaced with non-deponent verbs of a similar meaning) or changed to a non-deponent form. For example, in Spanish and Italian, ''mīrārī'' changed to ''mirar(e)'' by changing all the verb forms to the previously nonexistent "active form", and ''audeō'' changed to ''osar(e)'' by taking the participle ''ausus'' and making an ''-ar(e)'' verb out of it (note that ''au'' went to ''o'').

=== Defective verbs ===
[[Defective verbs]] are verbs that are conjugated in only some instances.
*Some verbs are conjugated only in the perfective aspect's tenses, yet have the imperfective aspect's tenses' meanings. As such, the perfect becomes the present, the pluperfect becomes the imperfect, and the future perfect becomes the future. Therefore, the defective verb ''ōdī'' means, "I hate." These defective verbs' principal parts are given in vocabulary with the indicative perfect in the first person and the perfect active infinitive. Some examples are:

::''ōdī, ōdisse'' – to hate
::''meminī, meminisse'' – to remember
::''coepī, coepisse'' – to have begun
*A few verbs, the meanings of which usually have to do with speech, appear only in certain occurrences.

::''Cedo'' (plur. ''cette''), which means "Hand it over" or "Out with it" is only in the imperative mood, and only is used in the second person.

The following are conjugated irregularly:

:'''Present Active Participle''' – ''fāns, fantis''
:'''Present Active Infinitive''' – ''fārī'' (variant: ''fārier'')
:'''Supine''' – (acc.) ''fātum'', (abl.) ''fātū''
:'''Gerund''' – (gen.) ''fandī,'' (dat. and abl.) ''fandō,'' no accusative
:'''Gerundive''' – ''fandus, –a, –um''

The Romance languages lost many of these verbs, but others (such as ''ōdī'') survived but became regular fully conjugated verbs (in Italian, ''odiare'').

=== Impersonal verbs ===
Impersonal verbs are those lacking a person. In English impersonal verbs are usually used with the neuter pronoun "it" (as in "It seems," or "It storms"). Latin uses the third person singular. These verbs lack a fourth principal part. A few examples are:

:''pluit, pluere, pluvit'' – to rain (it rains)
:''ningit, ningere, ninxit''{{ref|ningunt}} – to snow (it snows)
:''oportet, oportēre, oportuit'' – to be proper (it is proper, one should/ought to)
:''licet, licēre, licuit'' – to be permitted [to] (it is allowed [to])

The third person forms of ''esse'' may also be seen as impersonal when seen from the perspective of English:

:''Nox aestīva calida fuit.'' – It was a hot, summer night.
:''Est eī quī terram colunt.'' – It is they who till the land.

=== Irregular future active participles ===
As stated, the future active participle is normally formed by removing the ''–um'' from the supine, and adding a ''–ūrus.'' However, some deviations occur.

{| class="wikitable"
! Present&lt;br /&gt;active&lt;br /&gt;infinitive || Supine || Future&lt;br /&gt;active&lt;br /&gt;participle
|-
| ''iuvāre'' || ''iūtum ''|| ''iuvātūrus''
|-
| ''lavāre/lavere'' || ''lavātum'' (but PPP lautus) || ''lavātūrus''
|-
| ''parere'' || ''partum'' || ''paritūrus''
|-
| ''ruere'' || ''rutum'' || ''ruitūrus''
|-
| ''secāre'' || ''sectum'' || ''secātūrus''
|-
| ''fruī'' || ''frūctum/fruitum'' || ''fruitūrus''
|-
| ''nascī'' || ''nātum'' || ''nātūrus/nascitūrus''
|-
| ''morī''{{ref|moriri}} || ''mortuum'' || ''moritūrus''
|-
| ''orīrī'' || ''ortum'' || ''oritūrus''
|}

=== Alternative verb forms ===
Several verb forms may occur in alternative forms (in some authors these forms are fairly common, if not more common than the canonical ones):
*The ending ''–ris'' in the passive voice may be ''–re'' as in:
::''portābāris'' → ''portābāre''
*The ending ''–ērunt'' in the perfect may be ''–ēre'' (primarily in poetry) as in:
::''portāvērunt'' → ''portāvēre''
*The ending ''–ī'' in the passive infinitive may be ''–ier'' as in:
::''portārī'' → ''portārier'', ''dicī'' → ''dicier''

=== Syncopated verb forms ===
Like in most Romance languages, syncopated forms and [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]] are present in Latin. They may occur in the following instances:
*Perfect stems that end in a ''–v'' may be contracted when inflected.
::''portāvisse'' → ''portāsse''
::''portāvistī'' → ''portāstī''
::''portāverant'' → ''portārant''
::''portāvisset'' → ''portāsset''
*The compounds of ''noscere'' (to learn) and ''movēre'' (to move, dislodge) can also be contracted.
::''nōvistī'' → ''nōstī''
::''nōvistis'' → ''nōstis''
::''commōveram'' → ''commōram''
::''commōverās'' → ''commōrās''

This is a list of [[singer]]s who have performed in the [[Afrikaans]] language. Solo artists are alphabetised by their [[stage name]] or [[surname]]—whichever is more common. [[Choir]]s that sing in Afrikaans are also included in the list, but other [[music group]]s are listed in the "[[#Music groups|Music groups]]" section below.

The first major South African singers to record in Afrikaans were [[Ada Forrest]] and Annie Visser, in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= |encyclopedia=[[Standard Encyclopedia of Southern Africa]] |volume=5 |edition=1st |page=303 |year=1972 |publisher=Nasou |location=Cape Town |isbn=0625003217 |oclc=174335956 |quote=Apparently Annie Visser and Ada Forrest were the first major South African musicians whose work included recordings in 'the Taal' (early Afrikaans), both in 1908 in London.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some small sub communities or villages for instance Loming, Ahado, Oriaju, Hidonge and may also involved Atarangi who speak Lotuko because of their proximity to the neighboring Lotuko community

'''Lowland Peruvian Quechua''', or '''Chachapoyas–Lamas Quechua''', are [[Quechuan languages]] spoken in the lowlands of northern [[Peru]]. The two principal varieties are, 
*[[Lamas Quechua]], or San Martín Quechua (''Lamista, Llakwash Runashimi''), spoken in [[Lamas Province]] in [[San Martín Region]] and in some villages on the [[Huallaga River]] in the [[Ucayali Region]] by some 15,000 people
*[[Chachapoyas Quechua]] or Amazonas Quechua, spoken in [[Chachapoyas Province]] and [[Luya Province]] in the [[Amazonas Region]] by some 7000 people
*[[Southern Pastaza Quechua]], or ''Inga'', spoken in the province of [[Datem del Marañón Province|Datem del Marañón]] in the [[Loreto Region]] along the [[Huasaga River|Huasaga]], [[Manchari River|Manchari]], and [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]] rivers by approximately 3500 people.

Few children are learning Chachapoyas Quechua. [[Conila District|Conila]] is said to be the last village where children are able to speak it.

Lowland Peruvian Quechua is quite similar in pronunciation to the Ecuadorian [[Kichwa language]]. However, it has not been grammatically simplified (creolized?) to the same extent. For example, Lowland Peruvian maintains the [[clusivity|inclusive/exclusive]] distinction for "we".

Despite this, the language has never fallen completely out of use, with a minority having some knowledge of it; in addition, Manx still has a role as an important part of the island's culture and heritage. Manx has been the subject of [[language revival]] efforts with estimates, in 2015, of around 1,800 people with varying levels of [[second language]] conversational ability. Since the late 20th century, Manx has become more visible on the island, with increased signage, radio broadcasts and a bilingual primary school. The revival of Manx has been made easier because the language was well-recorded; for example, the Bible had been translated into Manx, and audio recordings had been made of native speakers.

==Names of the language==

===In Manx===
In Manx, the language is called ''Gaelg'' or ''Gailck'' (pronounced "gilk" or "gilg" or "gelg" with hard Gs), a word which shares the same etymology as the word "Gaelic", borrowed from Northern Irish. The sister languages of [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]] use ''Gaeilge'' (dialect variants Gaoluinn, Gaedhlag, Gaelge and Gaelic) and ''Gàidhlig'', respectively, for their languages. As with Irish and Scottish, the form with the [[definite article]] is frequently used in Manx, e.g. ''y Ghaelg'' or ''y Ghailck'' (Irish ''an Ghaeilge'', Scottish ''a' Ghàidhlig'').

To distinguish it from the two other forms of Gaelic, the phrases ''Gaelg''/''Gailck Vannin'' (Gaelic of [[Isle of Man|Mann]]) and ''Gaelg''/''Gailck Vanninnagh'' (Manx Gaelic) also are used. In addition, the nickname "Çhengey ny Mayrey" (the mother tongue/tongue of the mother, lit. the mother's tongue) is occasionally used.

===In English===
The language is usually referred to in English as "Manx". The term "Manx Gaelic" is often used, for example when discussing the relationship between the three Goidelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx) or to avoid confusion with [[Manx English|Anglo-Manx]], the form of English spoken on the island. Scottish Gaelic is often referred to in English as simply "Gaelic", but this is less common with Manx and Irish.

A feature of Anglo-Manx deriving from Gaelic&lt;!--- not really a calque---&gt; is the use of the definite article, e.g. "the Manx", "the Gaelic", in ways not generally seen in standard English.

The word "Manx" is frequently spelled "Manks" in historical sources, particularly those written by natives of the island; the word means "Mannish", and originates from the [[Old Norse]] ''Mannisk''. The name of the island, Man, is frequently spelled "Mann". It is sometimes accompanied by a footnote explaining that it is a two-syllable word, with the stress on the first syllable, "MAN-en". The island is named after the Irish god [[Manannán mac Lir]], thus ''Ellan Vannin'' (Irish ''Oileán Mhannanáin'') 'Mannanán's Island'.

The Manx language has had a substantial influence on the island's [[toponymy]] and nomenclature.]]

Manx is a [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] language, closely related to [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]]. On the whole it is partially mutually intelligible with these, and native speakers of one find it easy to gain passive, and even spoken, competency in the other two.

The earliest known language of the Isle of Man was a form of [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] (the language which developed into Welsh, Cornish and Breton); however, like [[Scottish Gaelic]] and modern Irish, Manx is descended from [[Primitive Irish]], which is first attested in [[Ogham]] inscriptions from the 4th century AD. These writings have been found throughout Ireland and the west coast of [[Great Britain]]. Primitive Irish transitioned into [[Old Irish]] through the 5th century. Old Irish, dating from the 6th century, used the [[Latin script]] and is attested primarily in [[marginalia]] to Latin manuscripts, but there are no extant examples from the Isle of Man. By the 10th century Old Irish had evolved into [[Middle Irish]], which was spoken throughout Ireland, in Scotland and in the Isle of Man. Like the coastal areas of Scotland and Ireland, the Isle of Man was colonised by the Norse, who left their legacy in certain loanwords, personal names, and place names such as [[Laxey]] (Laksaa) and [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]] (Rhumsaa). However, they made very little impact on the language overall.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/300505991|title=Language death in the Isle of Man : an investigation into the decline and extinction of Manx Gaelic as a community language in the Isle of Man|last=George.|first=Broderick,|date=1999|publisher=Niemeyer|isbn=9783110911411|oclc=300505991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the later Middle Ages, the Isle of Man fell increasingly under the influence of England, and from then on the [[English language]] has been the chief external factor in the development of Manx. Beginning in 1405, Manx experienced even more English influence under the rule of Sir John Stanley. As contact between Manx speakers and Gaelic speakers from Scotland and Ireland declined, the language diverged further from its related neighbours.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the 17th century, some university students left the Isle of Man to attend school in England. At the same time, teaching in English was required in schools founded by governor Isaac Barrow. Barrow also promoted the use of English in churches; he considered that it was a superior language for reading the Bible; however, because the majority of ministers were monolingual Manx speakers, his views had little practical impact.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Thomas Wilson began his tenure as Bishop of Mann in 1698 and was succeeded by Mark Hildesley. Both men held positive views of Manx; Wilson was the first person to publish a book in Manx, a translation of ''The Principles and Duties of Christianity'' (''Coyrie Sodjey''), and Hildesley successfully promoted the use of Manx as the language of instruction in schools. The New Testament was first published in Manx in 1767.  In the late 18th century, nearly every school was teaching in English. This decline continued into the 19th century, as English gradually became the primary language spoken on the Isle of Man.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1848, J.&amp;nbsp;G. Cumming wrote, "there are ... few persons (perhaps none of the young) who speak no English." [[Henry Jenner]] estimated in 1874 that about 30% of the population habitually spoke Manx (12,340 out of a population of 41,084). According to official census figures, 9.1% of the population claimed to speak Manx in 1901; in 1921 the percentage was only 1.1%.&lt;ref&gt;Gunther 1990, 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; Since the language was used by so few people, it had low linguistic "[[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]]", and parents tended to not teach Manx to their children, thinking it would be useless to them compared with English.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Revival==
Following the decline in the use of Manx during the 19th century, {{lang|gv|[[Manx Gaelic Society|Yn Çheshaght Ghailckagh]]}} (The Manx Language Society) was founded in 1899. By the middle of the 20th century, only a few elderly [[native speaker]]s remained (the last of them, [[Ned Maddrell]], died on December 27, 1974), but by then a scholarly revival had begun and a few individuals had started teaching it in schools. The Manx Language Unit was formed in 1992, consisting of three members and headed by Manx Language Officer [[Brian Stowell]], "which was put in charge of all aspects of Manx language teaching and accreditation in schools."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ager, Simon. "A Study of Language Death and Revival with a Particular Focus on Manx Gaelic." Master's Dissertation University of Wales, Lampeter, 2009. PDF.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to an increased interest in studying the Manx language and encouraged a renewed sense of ethnic identity. The revival of Manx has been aided by the recording work done in the 20th century by researchers. Most notably, the [[Irish Folklore Commission]] was sent in with recording equipment in 1948 by [[Éamon de Valera]]. Also important in preserving the Manx language was work conducted by language enthusiast and fluent speaker [[Brian Stowell]], who is considered personally responsible for the current revival of the Manx language.&lt;ref name=graun /&gt; The Manx Language Strategy was released in 2017, outlining a five-year plan for the language's continued revitalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.im/news/2017/dec/01/five-year-strategy-salutes-and-celebrates-manx-language/|title=Isle of Man Government - Five year strategy salutes and celebrates Manx language|website=www.gov.im|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theworldweekly.com/reader/view/magazine/2018-01-04/lifelines-for-indigenous-languages/10437|title=Lifelines for indigenous languages {{!}} The World Weekly|website=www.theworldweekly.com|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Unesco]]'s [[Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]] declared Manx as an [[extinct language]], despite the presence of hundreds of speakers on the Isle of Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/isle_of_man/7901763.stm |title=UN declares Manx Gaelic 'extinct' |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=20 February 2009 |website=[[bbc.co.uk]] |access-date=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Unesco's classification of the language has changed to "critically endangered".&lt;ref name=graun&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/apr/02/how-manx-language-came-back-from-dead-isle-of-man |title=How the Manx language came back from the dead |last1=Whitehead |first1=Sarah |date=2 April 2015 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2011 census, 1,823 out of 80,398 Isle of Man residents, or 2.27% of the population, claimed to have knowledge of Manx,&lt;ref name=Gov.im&gt;[http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/treasury/economic/census/census2011reportfinalresized.pdf Isle of Man Census Report 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108113021/http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/treasury/economic/census/census2011reportfinalresized.pdf |date=8 November 2012 }}. Retrieved 2012-10-19.&lt;/ref&gt; an increase of 134 people from the 2001 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manx Gaelic Revival 'Impressive'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/isle_of_man/4271840.stm|work=BBC News|date=22 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were spread roughly uniformly over the island: in [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] 566 people professed an ability to speak, read or write Manx; 179 in [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]], 146 in [[Onchan]], and 149 in Ramsey.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Traditional Manx given names are once again becoming common on the Isle of Man, especially ''Moirrey'' and ''Voirrey'' (Mary, properly pronounced similarly to the Scottish ''Moira'', but often mispronounced as ''Moiree/Voiree'' when used as a given name by non-Manx speakers), ''Illiam'' ([[William (name)|William]]), ''Orry'' (from the Manx King of Norse origin), ''Breeshey'' (also ''Breesha'') ([[Bridget (given name)|Bridget]]), ''Aalish'' (also ''Ealish'') ([[Alice (given name)|Alice]]), ''Juan'' ([[Jack (name)|Jack]]), ''Ean'' (Ian), ''Joney'' ([[John (name)|John]]), ''Fenella'' ([[Fionnuala]]), ''Pherick'' ([[Patrick (given name)|Patrick]]) and ''Freya'' (from the [[Freyja|Norse Goddess]]) remain popular.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Those who have learned Manx as a [[second language]] as part of the Manx language revival speak what has been called "Neo-Manx".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ie/books?id=5UEcAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=neomanx&amp;dq=neomanx&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-mMa2kcTaAhXiAsAKHabmDaYQ6AEIQjAF ''Writing the wind: a Celtic resurgence : the new Celtic poetry''], Thomas Rain Crowe, New Native Press, 1997, page 317&lt;/ref&gt; In Neo-Manx the grammar is different to the Manx spoken to by native speakers like Ned Maddrell and English words have been resubstituted by Gaelic words, leading some to say the new speakers of the language are not speaking "true Manx".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ie/books?id=wm5iAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=neomanx&amp;dq=neomanx&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAt4rMksTaAhUCI8AKHXDMCB04ChDoAQgyMAM Gaelic Identities], Gordon McCoy, Maolcholaim Scott, Institute of Irish Studies, Queen's University Belfast, 2000, page 141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ie/books?id=-YxnAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=neomanx&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=manx The Irish Review], Issues 28-29, Cork University Press, 2001, page 151&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{Main|Manx literature|Gaelic literature}}
{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}
Because Manx has never had a large number of speakers, it has never been practical to produce large amounts of written literature. However, a body of oral literature did exist. The "[[Fianna]]" tales and others like them are known, including the Manx ballad ''Fin as Oshin'', commemorating [[Finn MacCool]] and [[Ossian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/mb1896/p002.htm |title=pp2/5 Manx Ballads - Fin as Oshin |publisher=Isle-of-man.com |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the coming of Protestantism, Manx spoken tales slowly disappeared, while a tradition of ''carvals'' - religious songs or carols - developed with religious sanction.{{When|date=February 2009}}

As far as is known, there was no distinctively Manx written literature before the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. By that time, any presumed literary link with Ireland and Scotland, such as through Irish-trained priests, had been lost. The first published literature in Manx was ''The Principles and Duties of Christianity (Coyrie Sodjey)'', translated by Bishop of Man Thomas Wilson.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[Book of Common Prayer]] was translated by [[John Philips (bishop)|John Phillips]], the Welsh-born [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]] (1605–33). The early Manx script has some similarities with orthographical systems found occasionally in Scotland and in Ireland for the transliteration of Gaelic, such as the [[Book of the Dean of Lismore]], as well as some extensive texts based on English and Scottish English orthographical practices of the time. Little secular [[Manx literature]] has been preserved.

The New Testament was first published in 1767. When the [[Anglican church]] authorities started to produce written literature in the Manx language in the 18th century, the system developed by John Philips was further "anglicised"; the one feature retained from Welsh orthography was the use of {{angle bracket|y}} to represent [[schwa]] (e.g. {{lang|gv|cabbyl}} {{IPA|[kaːβəl]}} "horse" and {{lang|gv|cooney}} {{IPA|[kuːnə]}} "help" as well as {{IPA|/ɪ/}} (e.g. {{lang|gv|fys}} {{IPA|[fɪz]}} "knowledge"), though it is also used to represent {{IPA|[j]}}, as in English (e.g. {{lang|gv|y Yuan}} {{IPA|[ə juːan]}} "John" (vocative), {{lang|gv|yeeast}} {{IPA|[jiːəst]}} "fish").

Other works produced in the 18th and 19th century include catechisms, hymn books and religious tracts. A translation of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' was made in 1796.

A considerable amount of secular literature has been produced in the 20th and 21st centuries as part of the language revival. In 2006, the first full-length novel in Manx, ''Dunveryssyn yn Tooder-Folley'' (''The Vampire Murders'') was published by Brian Stowell, after being serialised in the press. There is an increasing amount of literature available in the language, and recent publications include Manx versions of the ''Gruffalo'' and ''Gruffalo's Child''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturevannin.im/cms/publication_type_index_1475.html |title=Books - Lioaryn &amp;#124; Culture Vannin &amp;#124; Isle of Man |website=Culturevannin.im |date= |accessdate=2017-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official recognition==

Manx is not officially recognised by any national or regional government, although its contribution to Manx culture and tradition is acknowledged by some governmental and non-governmental bodies. For example: 

The Standing Orders of the House of Keys provide that: "The proceedings of the House shall be in English; but if a Member at any point pronounces a customary term or sentence in Manx Gaelic or any other language, the Speaker may call upon the Member for a translation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tynwald.org.im/business/sto/Documents/20180604_PP2018-0067_KSO.pdf |title=Standing Orders of the House of Keys |accessdate=15 June 2018 |pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manx is used in the annual [[Tynwald]] ceremony and Manx words are used in official [[Tynwald]] publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tynwald - the Parliament of the Isle of Man |url=http://www.tynwald.org.im/Pages/default.aspx |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purpose of strengthening its contribution to local culture and community, Manx is recognised under the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] and in the framework of the [[British-Irish Council]].

[[File:BunscoillSignageOct2017.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sign at the Bunscoill Ghaelgagh at St John's]]
Manx is taught as a second language at all of the island's primary and secondary schools. The lessons are optional and instruction is provided by the [[Isle of Man Department of Education|Department of Education]]'s Manx Language Team which teach up to [[A Level]] standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Isle of Man Department of Education, Sport and Culture Report AbuseHelp |url=https://www.sch.im/ |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Bunscoill Ghaelgagh]], a primary school at [[St John's, Isle of Man|St John's]], has 67 children, as of September 2016, who receive nearly all of their education through the medium of the language. Children who have attended the school have the opportunity to receive some of their secondary education through the language at Queen Elizabeth II High School in [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]].

The playgroup organisation [[Mooinjer Veggey]], which operates the {{lang|gv|Bunscoill Ghaelgagh}}, runs a series of preschool groups that introduce the language.

== Learning the language ==

There are an increasing number of resources available for those wanting to learn the language. The Manx Language Development Officer for [[Culture Vannin]] manages the [http://www.learnmanx.com/ Learnmanx.com] website which has a wide variety of resources. These include [http://www.culturevannin.im/cms/page_288619.html mobile apps] a [http://greinneyder.podomatic.com/ new podcast] in Manx, the 1000 [http://www.learnmanx.com/cms/1000words.html words-in-Manx] challenge and the [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY5y-gRhKs8jPbIKdBEogUP_TXuqcPQfN Video-a-day] in Manx series.
The most recent development on the adult language front is the creation of a new on-line course, Say Something in Manx [https://www.saysomethingin.com/manx] which has been created in conjunction with the Say Something in Welsh [https://www.saysomethingin.com/welsh] 
It is hoped that this will be the main way on-line learners will access the language from now on.
2016 also saw the launch of a new dictionary for learners published by Culture Vannin &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learnmanx.com/cms/featured_article_451805.html |title=Manx Words |publisher=Learn Manx |date= |accessdate=2017-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Manx Bible===
:''In the time of Bishop Wilson it had been a constant source of complaint among the Manx clergy that they were the only church in Christendom that had no version of the Bible in the vulgar tongue. Wilson set to work to remedy the defect, and, with the assistance of some of his clergy, managed to get some of the Bible translated, and the Gospel of St. Matthew printed. Bishop Hildesley, his successor, with the help of the whole body of Manx clergy, completed the work, and in 1775 the whole Bible was printed.''&lt;ref name="isle-of-man.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/history/manks/jenner.htm |title=Henry Jenner - The Manx Language, 1875 |publisher=Isle-of-man.com |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible was first produced in Manx by a group of Anglican clergymen on the island. The Gospel of Matthew was printed in 1748. The four Gospels were produced in 1763 and Conaant Noa nyn Jiarn as Saualtagh Yeesey Creest (the [[New Testament]] of our Lord &amp; Saviour Jesus Christ) in 1767 by the [[Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge]] (SPCK). In 1772 the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew and printed, together with the Books of [[Wisdom of Solomon]] and [[Ecclesiasticus]] (Sirach) from the [[Apocrypha]]. Yn Vible Casherick (The Holy Bible) of the Old and New Testaments was published as one book by the SPCK in 1775. The bicentenary was celebrated on the Isle of Man in 1975 and included a set of stamps from the Isle of Man Post Office.

This 1775 edition effectively fixed the modern orthography of Manx Gaelic, which has changed little since. Jenner claims that some [[bowdlerisation]] had occurred in the translation, e.g. the occupation of [[Rahab]] the prostitute is rendered as ''ben-oast'',{{ref|http://www.mannin.info/MHF/test.php?book=6&amp;chap=2}} a hostess or female inn-keeper.&lt;ref name="isle-of-man.com"/&gt;

There was a translation of the Psalmyn Ghavid (Psalms of David) in metre in Manx by the Rev John Clague, vicar of Rushen, which was printed with the [[Book of Common Prayer]] of 1768. Bishop Hildesley required that these [[Metrical Psalms]] were to be sung in churches. These were reprinted by the [[Manx Language Society]] in 1905.

The [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] (BFBS) published the Conaant Noa (New Testament) in 1810 and reprinted it in 1824. Yn Vible Casherick (the Holy Bible) of the Old Testament and New Testament (without the two books of the Apocrypha) was first printed as a whole in 1819. BFBS last printed anything on paper in Manx in 1936 when it reprinted Noo Ean (the Gospel of St John); this was reprinted by [[Manx Gaelic Society|Yn Çheshaght Ghailckagh]] (The Manx Gaelic Society) in 1968. The Manx Bible was republished by Shearwater Press in July 1979 as Bible Chasherick yn Lught Thie (Manx Family Bible), which was a reproduction of the BFBS 1819 Bible.

Since 2014 the BFBS 1936 Manx Gospel of John has been available online on YouVersion and Bibles.org.

===Church===
Manx was used in some churches into the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="isle-of-man.com"/&gt; Although church services in Manx were once fairly common, they occur infrequently now. Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh, the Manx Language Society, hold an annual [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY9VF_bkZsw Christmas Service] at locations around the island.

==Classification and dialects==
Manx is one of the three descendants of [[Old Irish]] (via [[Middle Irish]] and early Modern Gaelic), and is closely related to [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]]. It shares a number of developments in phonology, vocabulary and grammar with Irish and Scottish Gaelic (in some cases only with dialects of these) and shows a number of unique changes. There are two attested dialects of Manx, Northern Manx and Southern Manx.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1984–86, 1:xxvii–xxviii, 160&lt;/ref&gt; A third dialect may have existed in-between, around Douglas.

Manx shares with Scottish Gaelic the partial loss of contrastive [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalisation]] of [[labial consonant]]s; thus while in Irish the velarised consonants {{IPA|/pˠ bˠ fˠ w mˠ/}} contrast [[phonemic]]ally with palatalised {{IPA|/pʲ bʲ fʲ vʲ mʲ/}}, in Scottish Gaelic and Manx, the phonemic contrast has been lost to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1955, 66. Jackson claims that northern Irish has also lost the contrast between velarised and palatalised labials, but this seems to be a mistake on his part, as both [[County Mayo|Mayo]] Irish and Ulster Irish are consistently described as having the contrast (cf. Mhac an Fhailigh 1968, 27; Hughes 1994, 621; see also Ó Baoill 1978, 87)&lt;/ref&gt; A consequence of this [[phonemic merger]] is that Middle Irish unstressed word-final {{IPA|[əβʲ]}} (spelled ''-(a)ibh'', ''-(a)imh'' in Irish and Gaelic) has merged with {{IPA|[əβ]}} (''-(e)abh'', ''-(e)amh'') in Manx; both have become {{IPA|[u]}}, spelled ''-oo'' or ''-u(e)''. Examples include {{lang|gv|shassoo}} ("to stand"; Irish {{lang|ga|seasamh}}), {{lang|gv|credjue}} ("religion"; Irish {{lang|ga|creideamh}}), {{lang|gv|nealloo}} ("fainting"; Early Modern Irish {{lang|ga|(i) néalaibh}}, lit. ''in clouds''), and {{lang|gv|erriu}} ("on you (plural)"; Irish {{lang|ga|oraibh}}).&lt;ref&gt;O'Rahilly 1932, 77–82; Broderick 1984–86, 2:152&lt;/ref&gt; 

Medial and final *bh and *mh have become {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} in general in Manx, thus ''shiu'' 'you PL', Scottish and Irish Gaelic ''sibh'' (''siph'' in Northern Irish, ''sib'' in South Connacht Irish; Lewis Gàidhlig has the variant ''siù'', besides the more general ''sibh''), -bh in final consonant clusters, e.g. Manx ''sharroo'' 'bitter', Scottish ''searbh'' {{IPA|/ʃærav/}}, Northern and Western Irish ''searbh'' {{IPA|/ʃæru/}}, Southern Irish ''searbh'' {{IPA|/ʃærəβ/}}, between vowels, e.g. Manx ''awin'' 'river' , Scottish ''abhainn'' {{IPA|/aviɲ/}}, Irish ''abhainn'' {{IPA|/aunʲ/}}, word-finally in monosyllables, e.g. Manx ''laaue'' 'hand', Scottish ''làmh'' {{IPA|/la:v/}}, Northern Irish {{IPA|/læ:w/}}, Western Irish ''lámh'' {{IPA|/lɑ:w/}}, Southern Irish {{IPA|/lɑ:β/}}, at the end of stressed syllables (see further below), as in ''sourey'' 'summer', Scotland and Ireland ''samhradh'', Scottish {{IPA|/saurəɣ/}}, Northern Irish {{IPA|/sauru/}}, Western and Southern Irish {{IPA|/saurə/}}. In all this Manx is virtually identical to Northern Irish. Rare retentions of the older pronunciation of "bh" include ''Divlyn'', ''Divlin'', Middle Irish ''Duibhlinn'' {{IPA|/d̪uβʲlʲinʲ:/}}, also written ''Duibhlinn'' in Modern Irish and Scots Gaelic.

Moreover, similarly to [[Munster Irish]], historical ''bh'' {{IPA|[βʲ]}} and ''mh'' (nasalised {{IPA|[βʲ]}}) tend to be lost in the middle or at the end of a word in Manx, either with [[compensatory lengthening]] or vocalisation as '''u''' resulting in [[diphthong]]isation with the preceding vowel. For example, Manx {{lang|gv|geurey}} ("winter") {{IPA|[ˈɡʲeurə], [ˈɡʲuːrə]}} and {{lang|gv|sleityn}} ("mountains") {{IPA|[ˈsleːdʒən]}} correspond to Irish {{lang|ga|geimhreadh}} and {{lang|ga|sléibhte}} (Southern Irish dialect spelling and pronunciation ''gíre'' ({{IPA|[ˈɟiːɾʲə]}}) and ''sléte'' ({{IPA|[ˈʃlʲeːtʲə]}})).&lt;ref&gt;O'Rahilly 1932, 24; Broderick 1984–86 3:80–83; Ó Sé 2000:15, 120&lt;/ref&gt; Another similarity to Munster Irish is the development of the Old Irish diphthongs {{IPA|[oi ai]}} before [[velarised]] consonants (spelled ''ao'' in Irish and Scottish Gaelic) to {{IPA|[eː]}} in many words, as in {{lang|gv|seyr}} ("carpenter") {{IPA|[seːr]}} and {{lang|gv|keyl}} ("narrow") {{IPA|[keːl]}} (spelled {{lang|ga|saor}} and {{lang|ga|caol}} in Irish and Scottish, and pronounced virtually the same in Munster).&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1955, 47–50; Ó Cuív 1944, 38, 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Like western and northern dialects of Irish (cf. [[Irish phonology#Word-initial consonant clusters|Irish phonology]]) and most dialects of Scottish Gaelic, Manx has changed the historical [[consonant cluster]]s {{IPA|/kn ɡn mn tn/}} to {{IPA|/kr ɡr mr tr/}}. For example, Middle Irish {{lang|mga|cnáid}} ("mockery") and {{lang|mga|mná}} ("women") have become {{lang|gv|craid}} and {{lang|gv|mraane}} respectively in Manx.&lt;ref&gt;O'Rahilly 1932, 22&lt;/ref&gt; The [[affrication]] of {{IPA|[t̪ʲ d̪ʲ]}} to {{IPA|[tʃ dʒ]}} is also common to Manx, northern Irish, and Scottish Gaelic.&lt;ref&gt;O'Rahilly 1932, 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Also like northern and western dialects of Irish, as well as like southern dialects of Scottish Gaelic (e.g. [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], [[Kintyre]]), the unstressed word-final syllable {{IPA|[iʝ]}} of Middle Irish (spelled ''-(a)idh'' and ''-(a)igh'') has developed to {{IPA|[iː]}} in Manx, where it is spelled ''-ee'', as in {{lang|gv|kionnee}} ("buy"; cf. Irish {{lang|ga|ceannaigh}}) and {{lang|gv|cullee}} ("apparatus"; cf. Gaelic {{lang|gd|culaidh}}).&lt;ref&gt;O'Rahilly 1932, 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Another property Manx shares with Ulster Irish and some dialects of Scottish Gaelic is that {{IPA|/a/}} rather than {{IPA|/ə/}} appears in unstressed syllables before {{IPA|/x/}} (in Manx spelling, ''agh''), for example {{lang|gv|jeeragh}} ("straight") {{IPA|[ˈdʒiːrax]}} (Irish {{lang|ga|díreach}}), {{lang|gv|cooinaghtyn}} ("to remember") {{IPA|[ˈkuːnʲaxt̪ən]}} (Gaelic {{lang|gd|cuimhneachd}}).&lt;ref&gt;O'Rahilly 1932, 110; Jackson 1955, 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Like southern and western varieties of Irish and northern varieties of Scottish Gaelic, but unlike the geographically closer varieties of [[Ulster Irish]] and Arran and Kintyre Gaelic, Manx shows vowel lengthening or diphthongisation before the Old Irish [[Irish phonology#Fortis and lenis sonorants|fortis and lenis sonorants]]. For example, {{lang|gv|cloan}} ("children") {{IPA|[klɔːn]}}, {{lang|gv|dhone}} ("brown") {{IPA|[d̪oːn]}}, {{lang|gv|eeym}} ("butter") {{IPA|[iːᵇm]}} correspond to Irish/Scottish Gaelic {{lang|ga|clann}}, {{lang|ga|donn}}, and {{lang|ga|im}} respectively, which have long vowels or diphthongs in western and southern Irish and in the Scottish Gaelic dialects of the [[Outer Hebrides]] and [[Skye]], thus western Irish {{IPA|[klˠɑːn̪ˠ]}}, Southern Irish/Northern Scottish {{IPA|[kl̪ˠaun̪ˠ]}}, {{IPA|[d̪ˠaun̪ˠ]/[d̪ˠoun̪ˠ]}}, {{IPA|[iːm]/[ɤim]}}), but short vowels and 'long' consonants in northern Irish, Arran, and Kintyre, {{IPA|[kl̪ˠan̪ːˠ]}}, {{IPA|[d̪ˠon̪ːˠ]}} and {{IPA|[imʲː]}}.&lt;ref&gt;O'Rahilly 1932, 51; Jackson 1955, 57–58; Holmer 1957, 87, 88, 106; 1962, 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Another similarity with southern Irish is the treatment of Middle Irish word-final unstressed {{IPA|[əð]}}, spelled ''-(e)adh'' in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. In nouns (including [[verbal noun]]s), this became {{IPA|[ə]}} in Manx, as it did in southern Irish, e.g. {{lang|gv|caggey}} ("war") {{IPA|[ˈkaːɣə]}}, {{lang|gv|moylley}} ("to praise") {{IPA|[ˈmɔlə]}}; cf. Irish {{lang|ga|cogadh}} and {{lang|ga|moladh}}, pronounced {{IPA|[ˈkˠɔɡˠə]}} and {{IPA|[ˈmˠɔl̪ˠə]}} in southern Irish.&lt;ref&gt;O'Rahilly 1932, 68; Broderick 1984–86, 2:56, 308&lt;/ref&gt; In [[finite verb]] forms before full nouns (as opposed to pronouns) {{IPA|[əð]}} became {{IPA|[ax]}} in Manx, as in southern Irish, e.g. {{lang|gv|voyllagh}} {{IPA|[ˈvɔlax]}} ("would praise"), cf. Irish {{lang|ga|mholfadh}}, pronounced {{IPA|[ˈβˠɔl̪ˠhəx]}} in southern Irish.&lt;ref&gt;O'Rahilly 1932, 75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manx dialects.png|thumb|left|Dialect map of Manx (boundaries are approximate)]]
Linguistic analysis of the last few dozen native speakers reveals a number of dialectal differences between the northern and the southern parts of the island. Northern Manx is reflected by speakers from towns and villages from [[Maughold]] in the northeast of the island to [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]] on the west coast. Southern Manx is used by speakers from the [[Sheading]] of [[Rushen]]. It is possible that written Manx represents a 'midlands' dialect of Douglas and surrounding areas.

In Southern Manx, older ''á'' and in some cases ''ó'' have become {{IPA|[æː]}}. In Northern Manx the same happens, but ''á'' sometimes remains {{IPA|[aː]}} as well. For example, {{lang|gv|laa}} ("day", cf. Irish {{lang|ga|lá}}) is {{IPA|[læː]}} in the south but {{IPA|[læː]}} or {{IPA|[laː]}} in the north. Old ''ó'' is always {{IPA|[æː]}} in both dialects, e.g. {{lang|gv|aeg}} ("young", cf. Irish {{lang|ga|óg}}) is {{IPA|[æːɡ]}} in both dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1984–8,6 1:160&lt;/ref&gt; In many words before ''rt'', ''rd'' and ''rg'', and in one or two other words ''á'', lengthened ''a'' and ''ó'' have become /œ:/, as in ''paayrt'' 'part' /pœ:rt/, ''ard'' 'high' /œ:rd/, ''jiarg'' 'red' /dʒœ:rg/, ''argid'' 'money, silver' /œ:rgid/ and ''aarey'' 'gold GEN' /œ:rə/.

In Northern Manx, older ''(e)a'' before ''nn'' in the same syllable is diphthongised, while in Southern Manx it is lengthened but remains a [[monophthong]]. For example, {{lang|gv|kione}} ("head", cf. Irish {{lang|ga|ceann}}) is {{IPA|[kʲaun]}} in the north but {{IPA|[kʲoːn]}} in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1984–86, 1:161&lt;/ref&gt;

Words with ''ua'' and in some cases ''ao'' in Irish and Scottish are spelled with ''eay'' in Manx. In Northern Manx, this sound is {{IPA|[iː]}}, while in Southern Manx it is {{IPA|[ɯː]}}, {{IPA|[uː]}}, or {{IPA|[yː]}}. For example, {{lang|gv|geay}} ("wind", cf. Irish {{lang|ga|gaoth}}) is {{IPA|[ɡiː]}} in the north and {{IPA|[ɡɯː]}} in the south, while {{lang|gv|geayl}} ("coal", cf. Irish {{lang|ga|gual}}) is {{IPA|[ɡiːl]}} in the north and {{IPA|[ɡyːl]}}, {{IPA|[ɡɯːl]}}, or {{IPA|[ɡuːl]}} in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1984–86, 1:161–62&lt;/ref&gt;

In both the north and the south, there is a tendency to insert a short {{IPA|[d]}} sound before a word-final {{IPA|[n]}} in monosyllabic words, as in {{IPA|[sleᵈn]}} for {{lang|gv|slane}} ("whole") and {{IPA|[beᵈn]}} for {{lang|gv|ben}} ("woman"). This phenomenon is known as [[pre-occlusion]]. In Southern Manx, however, there is pre-occlusion of {{IPA|[d]}} before {{IPA|[l]}} and of {{IPA|[ɡ]}} before {{IPA|[ŋ]}}, as in {{IPA|[ʃuːᵈl]}} for {{lang|gv|shooyl}} ("walking") and {{IPA|[lɔᶢŋ]}} for {{lang|gv|lhong}} ("ship"). These forms are generally pronounced without pre-occlusion in the north. Preocclusion of {{IPA|[b]}} before {{IPA|[m]}}, on the other hand, is more common in the north, as in {{lang|gv|trome}} ("heavy"), which is {{IPA|[t̪roᵇm]}} in the north but {{IPA|[t̪roːm]}} or {{IPA|[t̪roːᵇm]}} in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1984–86, 1:162–63&lt;/ref&gt; This feature is also found in [[Cornish language|Cornish]].

Southern Manx tends to lose word-initial {{IPA|[ɡ]}} before {{IPA|[lʲ]}}, while Northern Manx usually preserves it, e.g. {{lang|gv|glion}} ("glen") is {{IPA|[ɡlʲɔᵈn]}} in the north and {{IPA|[lʲɔᵈn]}} in the south, and {{lang|gv|glioon}} ("knee") is {{IPA|[ɡlʲuːn]}} in the north and {{IPA|[lʲuːᵈn]}} in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1984–86, 1:164–65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography==
The Manx [[orthography]] is unlike that of Irish and Scottish Gaelic, both of which use similar spelling systems derived from written [[Early Modern Irish]], which was language of the educated Gaelic elite of both Ireland and Scotland (where it was called [[Classical Gaelic]]) until the mid-19th century. In general, these orthographies retain spelling and derivation from older Gaelic, which means that there is not in a one-to-one system. Both systems use only 18 letters to represent around 50 phonemes. While Manx in effect uses the English spelling system, except for {{angle bracket|x}} and {{angle bracket|z}}, the 24 letters used in its orthography likewise do not cover a similar range of phonemes, and therefore many digraphs and trigraphs are used.

The Manx orthography was developed by people who were unaware of traditional Gaelic orthography, as they had learned literacy in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and English (the initial development in the 16th century), then only English (later developments). Therefore, the orthography is based of early Modern English pronunciation, and to a small extent Welsh, rather than from a pan-Gaelic point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Kelly|1870|p=xiii}} footnote in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NZENAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR13 Spoken Sound as a Rule for Orthography]'', credited to W. Mackenzie.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is an inconsistent and only partially phonemic spelling system, in a similar way as spelling in English. [[T.&amp;nbsp;F. O'Rahilly]] expressed the opinion that Gaelic in the Isle of Man was saddled with an inadaquate spelling which is neither traditional nor phonetic; if the traditional Gaelic orthography had been preserved, the close kinship that exists between Manx Gaelic and Scottish Gaelic would be obvious to all at first sight.&lt;ref&gt;O'Rahilly 1932, 128&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no evidence of [[Gaelic type|Gaelic script]] having been used on the island.

===Cedilla===
Manx uses relatively few [[diacritic]]s, but a [[cedilla]] is often (but not exclusively) used to differentiate between the two pronunciations of ''ch'':
* ''Çhiarn'' ({{IPA|/ˈt͡ʃaːrn/}}), meaning ''lord'', is pronounced with the [[voiceless palato-alveolar affricate|palato-alveolar affricate]] {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}}, as in the English "'''ch'''urch"
* ''Chamoo'' ({{IPA|/xaˈmu/}}), meaning ''nor'' or ''neither'', is pronounced with the [[voiceless velar fricative|velar fricative]] {{IPA|/x/}}, as in the [[Standard Scottish English|Scottish]] pronunciation of the word "lo'''ch'''" ({{IPA|/ˈlɒx/}}), a sound which is commonly represented by ''gh'' at the ends of words in Manx (as it often is in the English of Ireland).

===Examples===
The following examples are taken from Broderick 1984–86, 1:178–79 and 1:350–53. The first example is from a speaker of Northern Manx, the second from [[Ned Maddrell]], a speaker of Southern Manx.

The voiceless plosives are pronounced with [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]]. The dental, postalveolar and palato-velar plosives {{IPA|/t̪ d̪ tʲ dʲ kʲ/}} are [[affrication|affricated]] to {{IPA|[t̪͡θ d̪͡ð t͡ʃ d͡ʒ k͡xʲ]}} in many contexts.

Manx has an optional process of [[lenition]] of plosives between vowels, whereby voiced plosives and voiceless fricatives become voiced fricatives and voiceless plosives become either voiced plosives or voiced fricatives. This process introduces the [[allophone]]s {{IPA|[β ð z ʒ]}} to the series of voiced fricatives in Manx. The voiced fricative {{IPA|[ʒ]}} may be further lenited to {{IPA|[j]}}, and {{IPA|[ɣ]}} may disappear altogether. Examples include:&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1984–86, 3:3–13; Thomson 1992, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Another optional process of Manx phonology is [[pre-occlusion]], the insertion of a very short [[plosive consonant]] before a [[sonorant consonant]]. In Manx, this applies to stressed monosyllabic words (i.e. words one syllable long). The inserted consonant is homorganic with the following sonorant, which means it has the same [[place of articulation]]. Long vowels are often shortened before pre-occluded sounds. Examples include:&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1984–86, 3:28–34; 1993, 236&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/m/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ᵇm]}}: {{lang|gv|trome}} {{IPA|/t̪roːm/}} &gt; {{IPA|[t̪roᵇm]}} "heavy"
* {{IPA|/n/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ᵈn]}}: {{lang|gv|kione}} {{IPA|/kʲoːn/}} &gt; {{IPA|[kʲoᵈn]}} "head"

* {{IPA|/l/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ᵈl]}}: {{lang|gv|shooyll}} {{IPA|/ʃuːl/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ʃuːᵈl]}} "walking"

The trill {{IPA|/r/}} is realised as a one- or two-contact flap {{IPA|[ɾ]}} at the beginning of syllable, and as a stronger trill {{IPA|[r]}} when preceded by another consonant in the same syllable. At the end of a syllable, {{IPA|/r/}} can be pronounced either as a strong trill {{IPA|[r]}} or, more frequently, as a weak fricative {{IPA|[ɹ̝]}}, which may vocalise to a nonsyllabic {{IPA|[ə̯]}} or disappear altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1984–86; 3:17–18&lt;/ref&gt; This vocalisation may be due to the influence of [[Manx English]], which is itself a [[non-rhotic accent]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1955, 118; Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language, 1998, [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O29-ISLEOFMAN.html Isle of Man], retrieved 2008-09-28&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the pronunciation of {{IPA|/r/}} include:
* {{lang|gv|ribbey}} "snare" {{IPA|[ˈɾibə]}}
* {{lang|gv|arran}} "bread" {{IPA|[ˈaɾan]}}
* {{lang|gv|mooar}} "big" {{IPA|[muːr], [muːɹ̝], [muːə̯], [muː]}}

===Vowels===
The vowel phonemes of Manx are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1993, 230–33&lt;/ref&gt;

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|+ Manx vowel phonemes

The status of {{IPA|[æ]}} and {{IPA|[æː]}} as separate phonemes is debatable, but is suggested by the allophony of certain words such as {{lang|gv|ta}} "is", {{lang|gv|mraane}} "women", and so on. An alternative analysis is that Manx has the following system, where the vowels {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}} have allophones ranging from {{IPA|[ɛ]/[ɛː]}} through {{IPA|[æ]/[æː]}} to {{IPA|[a]/[aː]}}. As with Irish and Scottish Gaelic, there is a large amount of vowel allophony, such as that of {{IPA|/a/, /aː/}}. This depends mainly on the 'broad' and 'slender' status of the neighbouring consonants:

Manx has a relatively large number of [[diphthong]]s, all of them [[Height-harmonic|falling]]:

===Stress===
Stress generally falls on the first syllable of a word in Manx, but in many cases, stress is attracted to a long vowel in the second syllable.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1993, 236&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include:
* {{lang|gv|buggane}} {{IPA|/bəˈɣeːn/}} "sprite"
* {{lang|gv|tarroogh}} {{IPA|/t̪aˈruːx/}} "busy"
* {{lang|gv|reeoil}} {{IPA|/riːˈoːl/}} "royal"
* {{lang|gv|vondeish}} {{IPA|/vonˈd̪eːʃ/}} "advantage"

==Morphology==

=== Initial consonant mutations ===
Like all modern Celtic languages, Manx shows [[consonant mutation#Celtic languages|initial consonant mutation]]s, which are processes by which the initial consonant of a word is altered according to its [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and/or [[syntax|syntactic]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1984–86, 1:7–21; 1993, 236–39; Thomson 1992, 132–35&lt;/ref&gt; Manx has two mutations: '''[[lenition]]''' and '''[[eclipsis]]''', found on nouns and verbs in a variety of environments; adjectives can undergo lenition but not eclipsis. In the late spoken language of the 20th century the system was breaking down, with speakers frequently failing to use mutation in environments where it was called for, and occasionally using it in environments where it was not called for.

&lt;references group="*" /&gt;
In the corpus of the late spoken language, there is also one example of the elipisis (nasalisation) of {{IPA|/ɡ/}}: the sentence {{lang|gv|Ta mee er '''ng'''eddyn yn eayn}} ("I have found the lamb"), where ''ng'' is pronounced {{IPA|/n/}}. However, probably this was a mis-transcription; the verbal noun in this case is not {{lang|gv|geddyn}} "get, fetch", but rather {{lang|gv|feddyn}} "find".&lt;ref&gt;(Broderick 1984–86 2:190, 3:66).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nouns ===
Manx nouns fall into one of two [[grammatical gender|genders]], masculine or feminine. Nouns are inflected for [[grammatical number|number]]. The [[plural]] is formed in a variety of ways, most commonly by addition of the suffix {{lang|gv|-yn}} {{IPA|[ən]}}, but also by vowel change, changing {{lang|gv|-agh}} {{IPA|[ax]}} to {{lang|gv|-ee}} {{IPA|[iː]}} or {{lang|gv|-eeghyn}} {{IPA|[iːən]}} or by adding other endings. There is usually no inflection for [[grammatical case|case]], except in a minority of nouns that have a distinct genitive singular form, which is formed in various ways. (Most common is the addition of the suffix ''-ey'' {{IPA|[ə]}} to feminine nouns.) Historical genitive singulars are often encountered in [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] even when they are no longer [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]] forms; for example {{lang|gv|thie-ollee}} "cowhouse" uses the old genitive of {{lang|gv|ollagh}} "cattle".&lt;ref&gt;Thomson 1992, 118–19; Broderick 1993, 239–40&lt;/ref&gt; There are also traces of a dative singular in set phrases such as {{lang|gv|ry-chosh}} "on foot", contrasting with nominative {{lang|gv|cass}} and genitive {{lang|gv|coshey}} (cf. {{lang|gv|cullee choshey}} "footwear", {{lang|gv|bluckan coshey}} "football, soccer, rugby").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=First Lessons in Manx|last=Goodwin|first=Edmund|last2=Thomson|first2=Robert|publisher=Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh|year=1966|isbn=|location=|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adjectives ===
Certain adjectives have plural as well as singular forms (through the addition ''-ey'' {{IPA|[ə]}}), although the use of the singular adjective with a plural noun is usual. Most adjectives end in ''-agh'' {{IPA|[ax]}} and form their [[comparative]]/[[superlative]] form by replacing this with ''-ee'' {{IPA|[iː]}}, e.g. ''atçhimagh'' "terrible" becomes ''atçhimee'', giving ''ny s'atçhimee'' "more terrible" and ''s'atçhimee'' "most terrible". As in Irish and Scottish Gaelic, the comparative-superlative is commonly marked by the copula verb ''s'' (''is'') in the present, and ''by'' in the past; the superlative is often shown by the word "nys" /nis/, from Middle Irish ''ní as'' "thing that is" (cf. Irish ''níos'', past ''ní ba''). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conversational Manx|last=Gell|first=John|publisher=Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh|year=1989|isbn=1870029100|location=St. Judes|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of adjectives form their comparative/superlative irregularly:

|}
The comparative/superlative can also be formed using {{lang|gv|smoo}} "more" with the positive form e.g. {{lang|gv|s'thrimmey}} = {{lang|gv|smoo trome}}.

=== Pronouns ===
In common with Irish and Scottish Gaelic, in addition to its regular personal pronouns, Manx has also a series used for emphasis. Under certain phonological circumstances, these can be used as unemphatic pronouns, e.g. "you were not" is {{lang|gv|cha row uss}} {{IPA|[xa ˈrau ʊs]}} as {{lang|gv|cha row oo}} {{IPA|[xa ˈrau u(ː)]}} sounds too similar to {{lang|gv|cha row}} {{IPA|[xa ˈrau]}} "they/he/she was not".

Notice the only difference between the masculine and feminine third person singular possessive pronouns is the [[Consonant mutation|initial sound change]], namely lenition and h-prefixing,  they cause, e.g. {{lang|gv|e glioonag}} "her laptop", {{lang|gv|e ghlioonag}} "his laptop", ''e ooh'' "his egg", ''e hooh'' "her egg".

An alternative to using the possessive pronouns is to precede a noun with the definite article and follow it with the inflected form of {{lang|gv|ec}} "at" to show the person, e.g. {{lang|gv|yn thie aym}} "my house" (literally "the house at me") instead of {{lang|gv|my hie}} "my house". This is especially useful in the plural, where all persons share one possessive pronoun, e.g. {{lang|gv|yn thie oc}} "their house", as opposed to {{lang|gv|nyn dhie}} "our/your/their house".

=== Verbs ===
Manx verbs generally form their [[finite verb|finite]] forms by means of [[periphrasis]]: inflected forms of the [[auxiliary verb]]s {{lang|gv|ve}} "to be" or {{lang|gv|jannoo}} "to do" are combined with the [[verbal noun]] of the main verb. Only the [[future tense|future]], [[conditional tense|conditional]], [[preterite]], and [[imperative mood|imperative]] can be formed directly by inflecting the main verb, but even in these tenses, the periphrastic formation is more common in Late Spoken Manx.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1984–86, 75–82; 1993, 250, 271; Thomson 1992, 122&lt;/ref&gt; Examples:

The future and conditional tenses (and in some [[irregular verb]]s, the preterite) make a distinction between [[Dependent and independent verb forms|"independent" and "dependent" forms]]. Independent forms are used when the verb is not preceded by any particle; dependent forms are used when a particle (e.g. {{lang|gv|cha}} "not") does precede the verb. For example, "you will lose" is {{lang|gv|caillee oo}} with the independent form {{lang|gv|caillee}} ("will lose"), while "you will not lose" is {{lang|gv|cha gaill oo}} with the dependent form {{lang|gv|caill}} (which has undergone [[#Initial consonant mutations|eclipsis]] to {{lang|gv|gaill}} after {{lang|gv|cha}}). Similarly "they went" is {{lang|gv|hie ad}} with the independent form {{lang|gv|hie}} ("went"), while "they did not go" is {{lang|gv|cha jagh ad}} with the dependent form {{lang|gv|jagh}}.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1984–86, 1:92; 1992, 250; Thomson 1992, 122&lt;/ref&gt; This contrast is inherited from Old Irish, which shows such pairs as {{lang|sga|beirid}} ("(s)he carries") vs. {{lang|sga|ní beir}} ("(s)he does not carry"), and is found in Scottish Gaelic as well, e.g. {{lang|gd|gabhaidh}} ("will take") vs. {{lang|gd|cha ghabh}} ("will not take"). In Modern Irish, the distinction is found only in irregular verbs (e.g. {{lang|ga|chonaic}} ("saw") vs. {{lang|ga|ní fhaca}} ("did not see").

The fully inflected forms of the regular verb {{lang|gv|tilgey}} "to throw" are as follows. In addition to the forms below, a past participle may be formed using {{lang|gv|-it}}: {{lang|gv|tilgit}} "thrown".

=== Adverbs ===
Manx adverbs can be formed from adjectives by means of the word {{lang|gv|dy}}, e.g. {{lang|gv|mie}} "good", {{lang|gv|dy mie}} "well";  {{lang|gv|gennal}} "cheerful", {{lang|gv|dy gennal}} "cheerfully". This {{lang|gv|dy}} is omitted when preceded by such words as {{lang|gv|ro}} "too" and {{lang|gv|feer}} "very" or followed by {{lang|gv|dy liooar}} "enough", e.g. {{lang|gv|feer vie}} "very good, very well", {{lang|gv|gennal dy liooar}} "cheerful(ly) enough". The adverb for "home(wards)" is formed with {{lang|gv|dy}} and the noun {{lang|gv|balley}} "place, town, homestead" to give {{lang|gv|dy valley}}, whereas the noun {{lang|gv|thie}} "house, home" can be used unchanged to convey the same meaning.

The language has a number of adverbs corresponding to English "up" and "down", the meaning of which depend upon such things as motion or lack thereof and starting point in relation to the speaker.
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Manx adverbs expressing "up" and "down"

|-

|{{lang|gv|sheese}} {{IPA|/ʃiːs/}}

Examples of practical usage are {{lang|gv|Ta dooinney heese y traid}} "There's a man down the street" and {{lang|gv|Ta mee goll sheese y traid}} "I'm going down the street", {{lang|gv|Jean drappal neese}} "Climb up (towards me)" and {{lang|gv|Jean drappal seose}} "Climb up (away from me)".

=== Prepositions ===
Like the other [[Insular Celtic languages]], Manx has so-called [[inflected preposition]]s, contractions of a [[preposition]] with a [[pronoun|pronominal]] direct object, as the following common prepositions show. Note the sometimes identical form of the uninflected preposition and its third person singular masculine inflected form.

In addition to the above "simple" prepositions, Manx has a number of prepositional phrases based on a noun; being based on nouns, the possessive personal pronouns are used to refer to what would in English be pronominal prepositional objects. This also happens in English phrases such as "for my sake".

==Syntax==
Like most Insular Celtic languages, Manx uses [[verb–subject–object]] word order: the inflected verb of a sentence precedes the [[subject (grammar)|subject]], which itself precedes the [[direct object]].&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1993, 276&lt;/ref&gt; However, as noted above, most finite verbs are formed periphrastically, using an auxiliary verb in conjunction with the verbal noun. In this case, only the auxiliary verb precedes the subject, while the verbal noun comes after the subject. The auxiliary verb may be a [[modal verb]] rather than a form of {{lang|gv|bee}} ("be") or {{lang|gv|jannoo}} ("do"). Particles like the negative {{lang|gv|cha}} ("not") precede the inflected verb. Examples:

|}
&lt;/div&gt;

When the auxiliary verb is a form of {{lang|gv|jannoo}} ("do"), the direct object precedes the verbal noun and is connected to it with the particle {{lang|gv|y}}:

&lt;div style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
{|
| {{sm|aux.&lt;br /&gt;verb}} || {{sm|subject}}
| colspan=2 | {{sm|direct&lt;br /&gt;object}}
|  || {{sm|main&lt;br /&gt;verb}}
|-

|-
| did || they || my || voice || {{sc|particle}} || hear-{{sc|v.n.}}
|-
| colspan=6 | "They heard my voice."&lt;ref name="Thoms105"/&gt;
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

As in Irish (cf. [[Irish syntax#The forms meaning "to be"]]), there are two ways of expressing "to be" in Manx: with the substantive verb {{lang|gv|bee}}, and with the copula. The substantive verb is used when the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] is an adjective, adverb, or [[prepositional phrase]].&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1993, 276–77&lt;/ref&gt; Examples:

&lt;div style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
{|
| {{lang|gv|t'}} || {{lang|gv|eh}} || {{lang|gv|agglagh}}
|-
| is || it || awful/frightening
|-
| colspan=3 | "It is awful/frightening."
|}
&amp;nbsp;
{|
| {{lang|gv|t'}} || {{lang|gv|eh}} || {{lang|gv|dy mie}}
|-
| is || he || well
|-
| colspan=3 | "He is well"
|}
&amp;nbsp;
{|
| {{lang|gv|t'}} || {{lang|gv|eh}} || {{lang|gv|ayns}} || {{lang|gv|y}} || {{lang|gv|thie-oast}}
|-
| is || he || in || the || house-ale ([[pub]])
|-
| colspan=5 | "He is in the ale-house ([[pub]])."
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

Where the predicate is a noun, it must be converted to a prepositional phrase headed by the preposition {{lang|gv|in}} ("in") + possessive pronoun (agreeing with the subject) in order for the substantive verb to be grammatical:

&lt;div style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
{|
| {{lang|gv|t'}} || {{lang|gv|eh}} || {{lang|gv|ny}} || {{lang|gv|wooinney}} || {{lang|gv|mie}}
|-
| is || he || in-his || man || good
|-
| colspan=5 | "He is a good man" (lit. "He is in his good man")&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1993, 277&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

Otherwise, the copula is used when the predicate is a noun. The copula itself takes the form {{lang|gv|is}} or {{lang|gv|she}} in the present tense, but it is often omitted in affirmative statements:

&lt;div style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
{|
| {{lang|gv|She}} || {{lang|gv|Manninagh}} || {{lang|gv|mish}}
|-
| {{sc|copula}} || Manxman || me
|-
| colspan=3 | "I am a Manxman."&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1993, 278&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
&amp;nbsp;
{|
| {{lang|gv|Shoh}} || {{lang|gv|'n}} || {{lang|gv|dooinney}}
|-
| this || the || man
| colspan=3 | "This is the man."&lt;ref name=Thoms105&gt;Thomson 1992, 105&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

In questions and negative sentences, the present tense of the copula is {{lang|gv|nee}}:

&lt;div style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
{|
| {{lang|gv|Cha}} || {{lang|gv|nee}} || {{lang|gv|mish}} || {{lang|gv|eh}}
|-
| not || {{sc|copula}} || me || him
|-
| colspan=4 | "I am not him."&lt;ref name=Thoms105 /&gt;
|}
&amp;nbsp;
{|
| {{lang|gv|Nee}} || {{lang|gv|shoh}} || {{lang|gv|'n}} || {{lang|gv|lioar?}}
|-
| {{sc|copula}} || this || the || book
|-
| colspan=4 | "Is this the book?"&lt;ref name=Thoms105 /&gt;
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

==Vocabulary==
Manx vocabulary is predominantly of Goidelic origin, derived from Old Irish and closely related to words in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. However, Manx itself, as well as the languages from which it is derived, borrowed words from other languages as well, especially [[Latin]], [[Old Norse]], [[French language|French]] (particularly [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]), and English (both [[Middle English]] and Modern English).&lt;ref&gt;Broderick 1993, 282–83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loanwords===
[[File:Manx loaghtan.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Manx Loaghtan|Loaghtan]], a Manx breed of primitive sheep. The name means "mousy grey" in Manx.]]
Foreign loanwords are primarily [[Norse language|Norse]] and [[English language|English]], with a smaller number coming from French. Some examples of Norse loanwords are ''garey'' ("[[garden]]", from ''[[wikt:garðr|garðr]]'', "enclosure") and ''sker'' meaning a sea rock (from ''[[wikt:sker|sker]]'', compare with ''[[wikt:skjær#Etymology 2|skjær]]'' and ''[[wikt:sker#Icelandic|sker]]''). Examples of French loanwords are ''danjeyr'' ("danger", from ''[[wikt:danger#French|danger]]'') and ''vondeish'' ("advantage", from ''[[wikt:avantage|avantage]]'').

English loanwords were common in late (pre-revival) Manx, e.g. ''boy'' ("boy"), ''badjer'' ("[[badger]]"), rather than the more usual Gaelic ''guilley'' and ''brock''. [[Henry Jenner]], on asking someone what he was doing, was told ''Ta mee smokal pipe'' ("I am smoking a pipe"), and that "[he] certainly considered that he was talking Manx, and not English, in saying it." In more recent years, there has been a reaction against such borrowing, resulting in coinages for technical vocabulary. Despite this, [[calque]]s exist in Manx, not necessarily obvious to its speakers.

Some religious terms come ultimately from Latin, Greek and Hebrew, e.g. ''casherick'' (holy), from the Latin ''consecrātus''; ''mooinjer'' (people) from the Latin ''monasterium'' (originally a [[monastery]]; ''agglish'' (church) from the Greek ''ἐκκλησία'' (''ekklesia'', literally meaning assembly) and ''abb'' ([[abbot]]) from the Hebrew "אבא" (''abba'', meaning "father"). These did not necessarily come directly into Manx, but via Old Irish. In more recent times, ''ulpan'' has been borrowed from [[modern Hebrew]]. Many Irish and English loanwords also have a classical origin, e.g. ''çhellveeish'' (Irish ''teilefís'') and ''çhellvane'' meaning [[television]] and [[telephone]] respectively. Foreign language words (usually known via English) are used occasionally especially for ethnic food, e.g. chorizo, spaghetti.

To fill gaps in recorded Manx vocabulary, revivalists have referred to modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic for words and inspiration.

Going in the other direction, Manx Gaelic has influenced [[Manx English]] (Anglo-Manx). Common words and phrases in Anglo-Manx originating in the language include ''tholtan'' (the "th" is pronounced as a "t") meaning a ruined farmhouse, ''quaaltagh'' meaning a [[first-foot]], ''keeill'' meaning a church (especially an old one), ''[[cammag]]'', ''traa-dy-liooar'' meaning "time enough", and [[Tynwald]] (''tinvaal''), which is ultimately of Norse origin, but comes via Manx. It is suggested that the [[House of Keys]] takes its name from ''Kiare as Feed'' (four and twenty), which is the number of its sitting members.

==Works==
''Hagahot Maimuniot'', authored by Meir HaCohen, is one of the most important sources for the halachic rulings of medieval Ashkenazi rabbis. It takes the form of a running commentary on the [[Mishneh Torah]] by [[Maimonides]], and nowadays commonly appears at the bottom of the page in many printed editions of Mishneh Torah. There is also a section entitled ''Teshuvot Maimuniot'' which appears at the end of each book of Mishneh Torah.&lt;ref name=jvl/&gt;

The [[Paper Mate]] PhD Multi is a [[pen]]/[[pencil]]/[[stylus]] combination. The PhD series of pens and pencils have been specifically designed for durability and comfort, notably with a unique ergonomic, cushioned triangular grip that is endorsed by the [[American Physical Therapy Association]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apta.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Endorsed_Products&amp;Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=79608{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PhD series of pens also distinguishes itself from most other Paper mate products by having a sturdier, higher-quality design.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.papermate.com/Pages/products.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanics and Design==
The modes of the pen (black ink), pencil (0.5mm [[Pencil lead|lead]]), stylus for a [[Resistive touchscreen|touchscreen]] device (orange blunt plastic tip), and retracting the pen are engaged by turning the barrel. A button at the top releases the lead when pressed, and the button's cap can be removed to reveal an [[eraser]].  The PhD is also available with a red ink cartridge in place of the PDA stylus.

== Replacement and Maintenance ==
Since [[Paper Mate]] has no signification on replacement parts and model numbers, there have been owners who have done modifications with other pen ink cartridges. These owners would take other [[Paper Mate]] ballpoint stick pens and trim their cartridges with the original cartridges. In addition, you can use [[Paper Mate]]'s Inkjoy 100 RT substitute refills with the same process of trimming.

The '''Parachi language''' is an [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] language. Parachi is spoken by some 600 individuals of the Parachi ethnic group in eastern [[Afghanistan]], mainly in the upper part of [[Nijrab District]], northeast of [[Kabul province|Kabul]], out of a total ethnic Parachi population of some 5,000. 

It is closely related to the [[Ormuri language]] of [[Kaniguram]] in [[South Waziristan]], [[Pakistan]]. Parachi is usually classified as a member of the Southeastern group of the [[Eastern Iranian languages]],&lt;ref name = "Iranica"&gt;Nicholas Sims-Williams, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eastern-iranian-languages Eastern Iranian languages], in Encyclopaedia Iranica, Online Edition, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; although this is an [[Sprachbund|areal]] group rather than a genetical one.

'''Paul Maas''' (18 November 1880, in [[Frankfurt am Main]]{{spaced ndash}}15 July 1964, in [[Oxford]]) was a [[Germany|German]] scholar who, along with [[Karl Lachmann]]  founded the field of [[textual criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.uib.no/stemmatology/index.php/Paul_Maas&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.textualscholarship.org/stemmatics/&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied [[classical philology]] at the universities of [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[University of Munich|Munich]], receiving his doctorate in 1903. In 1910 he obtained his [[habilitation]] and in 1920 became a full professor at Berlin. In 1930 he was appointed chair of classical philology at the [[University of Königsberg]]. In 1934 he was forced into retirement by the Nazi government, and in 1939 emigrated to Great Britain, where he taught classes at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2Ytpiq7Oy7gC&amp;pg=PA648&amp;lpg=PA648&amp;dq=%22Maas,+Paul%22+1880+Frankfurt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9ZWay8SsZk&amp;sig=zBuqJkSArzRXBcRVURa3mLLy_5c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3-ZaI3NHRAhVr1oMKHdYHBlE4ChDoAQgZMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Maas%2C%20Paul%22%201880%20Frankfurt&amp;f=false Kraatz - Menges / edited by Rudolf Vierhaus] Deutsche Biographische Enzyklopaedie&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BR&gt;[https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/gnd11888185X.html#ndbcontent Maas, Paul] In: [[Neue Deutsche Biographie]] (NDB).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10218">{{Unreferenced|date=May 2018}}The '''portrait''' is a literary [[genre]] derived from pictorial portraiture.

The imitation of [[painting]] is apparent in the name of the genre itself, which is a painting term. Historians of [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] recognised the task of the portrait as representation; we find the beginnings of the narrative portrait in [[Livy]] and [[Tacitus]]. However, the portrait began to emerge from the need to describe oneself (self-portrait) or one's contemporaries, as in the ''Essays'' of [[Montaigne]]. This latter work develops a line of questioning around the movement of the representation of the individual (or of a society) from the pictorial mode to the discursive mode.

The portrait can be realised in [[prose]] or in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]. Its objectives vary according to context: sociocultural, sociopolitical, historical, or again according to the subjectivity of the portraitist (the writer). Thus one can speak of a fictional portrait (corresponding to the characters who populate the fictional universe of each [[author]]) as much as a realist one (representing real-life people).

The portrait oscillates between [[reality]] and [[fiction]], between [[eulogy]] and [[satire]], between one portrait which imitates its original and another which moves away from it (such as the [[caricatures]] found in newspapers or in [[Molière]]). Nevertheless, the objective portrait which describes the flaws and qualities of the individual represented (or equally the object or the idea) is quite widespread. The literary portrait evolved through the centuries and its development has been shaped by writers as well as literary critics and theorists.

== The portrait in the seventeenth century ==
It is from the 1650s that the portrait began to be defined as a literary genre. It is through the social innovations of the ''précieuses'' - such as [[La Grande Mademoiselle]] who, influenced by the portrait-laden works of [[Madeleine de Scudéry]], gathered around her (as a ''salonnière'' or ‘salon hostess’) men of letters - that the portrait was transformed into a ‘diversion of society’.

The literary portrait held to the essential aesthetic rules of the pictorial mode - that is, it had to describe the individual (model) faithfully in order to disguinguish it as a type apart. Nevertheless, it was not to be inferred from the recognition of the individual represented, but rather from the portraitist's style. This narrative representation had the function of highlighting fixed and timeless physical and mental features, as one sees in the works of Molière or in the ''Caractères'' by [[Jean de La Bruyère]]. It had to be achieved through layers of successive description - as in painting - which were only distinct phrases describing the real model's features.

== The portrait in the eighteenth century ==
The Age of Enlightenment heralded a new phase in the development of the literary portrait. It invaded literature and even contaminated music. [[Mozart]] and [[Beethoven]] excelled in this genre. Nevertheless, the portrait carried more of the psychology of the model represented than his or her physical appearance.

In [[Denis Diderot]], it is precisely the pictorial portrait that is the occasion of a narrative self-portrait effected in the form of an artistic critique of the paintings and statues which were made of him. Thus he did not like the painting by [[Louis Michel van Loo]] portraying him:

{{Quote
|''Quite alive; it’s his gentleness, with his vivacity; but too young, head too small, pretty like a woman, ogling, smiling, cute, giving a small kiss, affected mouth […] Sparkling close up, vigorous from afar, especially the skin. Besides, well-modelled beautiful hands, except the left, which is not drawn. We see it from the front; his head is bare; his grey tufts, with his preciousness, gives him the appearance of an old coquette who is still loveable; the position of a secretary of state and not a philosopher. The falsity of the first moment influenced everything else.''
}}
The philosopher blamed the painter's wife for having prevented him from being himself: “It is this madwoman, madame Van Loo, who had come to gossip with him while he was being painted, who gave him that air, and who spoiled everything.” Diderot took to imagining what his portrait would have been like: 
{{Quote
|''If she had taken to her [[harpsichord]] and improvised, or sung''

Non ha ragione, ingrate,
Un core abbandonato

''or some other piece of the same genre, the sensitive philosopher would have taken an altogether different character; and the portrait would have been effective. Or better still he had been left alone and abandoned to his reverie. So would the mouth have been ajar, his distracted looks would have been carried away, the inner workings of his head would have been painted on his face, and Michel would have done a beautiful thing.''
}}
After criticizing the portrait that portrays him, he writes:
{{Quote
|''But what will my little children say when they come to compare my sad works with that laughing, cute, effeminate old flirt there?'' 
}}
He informs them, “My children, I tell you that it is not me,” and undertakes to trace in writing the real portrait of himself:
{{Quote
|''I had in one day a hundred different physiognomies, according to the thing by which I was affected. I was serene, sad, dreamy, tender, violent, passionate, enthusiastic; but I was never such as you see me there. I had a large forehead, very lively eyes, broad features, a head quite like an ancient orator, a ''bonhomie'' that touched very closely the stupidity and rustic character of former times. Without the exaggeration of all the features in the engraving made from Greuze’s pencil, I would have been infinitely better. I have a mask that deceives the artist; either there is too much melted together or the impressions of my soul succeed each other very quickly and paint themselves all over my face: the eye of the painter does not find me the same from one moment to the other; his task becomes much more difficult than he had believed it to be.'' 
}}
According to Diderot, only one painter managed to make a pictorial portrait of him in which he recognizes himself and that is [[Jean-Baptiste Garand]]: by an apparent irony of fate, this success was the result of chance: 
{{Quote
|''It never was done well save by a poor devil named Garand, who caught me, as happens to a fool who says a good word. Whoever sees my portrait by Garand, sees me.'' Ecco il vero Pulcinella.
}}
Moreover, the semi-private sphere of correspondence also allowed the sketching of portraits in principle intended solely for the use of the recipient of the letter. Thus, [[Marie Du Deffand]], taking the thermal waters at [[Forges-les-Eaux]], was able to draw a sharp and cheerful portrait of [[Madame de Pecquigny]], the companion that fate had assigned her during her treatment: 
{{Quote
|''La Pecquigny is no resource, and her spirit is like space; there is no extension, depth, and perhaps all the other dimensions that I can not say, because I do not know them; but this is only empty for use. She has felt everything, judged everything, tested everything, chosen everything, rejected everything; she is, she says, a singular difficulty in company, and yet all day long she jabbers with our little ladies like a magpie.''
}}
However, it is not so much her spirit - or the way she uses it - that irritates Marie Du Deffand as the woman's quirks:
{{Quote
|''But that’s not what I do not like about her. It’s convenient for me today and it will be very pleasant for me as soon as Forment arrives. What is unbearable to me is dinner. She looks crazy while eating; she breaks up a chicken in the dish where it is served, then she puts it in another, has brought broth to put on it, just like the one she makes, and then she takes a wing, then the body, of which she only eats half, and then she does not want us to turn the calf to cut a bone, lest we soften the skin; she cuts a bone with all possible pain, she gnaws half of it, then returns to her hen; it lasts two hours. She has on her plate heaps of gnawed bones, of sucked skins, and, during that time, either I am bored to death or I eat more than I should. It is a curious thing to see her eat a biscuit; it lasts half an hour and the fact of the matter is that she eats like a wolf. It truly is an enraging exercise.''
}}
Marie Du Deffand completes this portrait of an eccentric by linking her to her interlocutor: “I am sorry that you have in common with her the impossibility of staying a minute at rest.” After which she concludes, in accordance with the philosophy of resignation and disinterest she defends, the temporary nature of that which she will have to endure on this “holiday meeting”: 
{{Quote
|''Finally - do you want me to tell you? She is no less amiable. She has no doubt of her wit. But all this is poorly digested, and I do not think it is worth more. She lives comfortably, but I would challenge her to be difficult with me. I submit to all her whims because she does nothing to me. Our present union will be of no consequence for the future.''
}}

== The portrait of the nineteenth century ==
The evolution of the narrative portrait did not stop at the nineteenth century but, on the contrary, it became more refined and took on nuances through the intervention of [[Sainte-Beuve]] in the works or the critiques of such literary portraits.

In fact, the portrait found a true place in the novel where it represented not only real-life individuals but also fictional individuals (who could also be symbolic). It is in this way that the portrait became a predominant and recurring theme in the work of [[Balzac]].

== The portrait of the twentieth century ==
The portrait continued its journey throughout the twentieth century with the modern novel. In [[Nathalie Sarraute]] (in the Portrait d'un inconnu) the features are not fixed, the temporality plays its role in the genre of the moving portrait, progressive, fragmented, as in the life of a human.

'''Punalur Balan''' (1927–1987) was an [[India]]n writer and a poet in [[Malayalam]]. He was born on 3 January 1927 in [[Punalur]], [[Kollam district]], [[Kerala]]. From his student days he was associated with the [[Communist]] movement and shot to fame during  the '[[Pink Decade]]' in [[Malayalam]] poetry.

Balan wrote lyrics and songs profusely for the cultural forums of the Communist Party and when the [[Kerala People's Arts Club]] (KPAC) staged its first play ''Ente Makananu Sari'' Balan penned the lyrics. After taking his B.A and B.Ed. he became a school teacher. He took his M.A in Malayalam and turned a journalist. Later he joined the State Institute of Languages as a Research Officer. [[Kerala Sahitya Academy]] award  was given to his collection ''Kottayile Pattu'' in 1975.

His poems are marked by a unique force which stems from the use of condensed language aimed at expressing the subtle human experiences of the modern man viewed through  the [[Marxist]] angle tinged with piercing social satire.

He died on 19 March 1987.

The '''Romanian Wikipedia''' (abr. ''ro.wiki'' or ''ro.wp'';&lt;ref&gt;[[:ro:Ajutor:Ro.wp|The article on this matter]] on the Romanian Wikipedia {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Romanian: ''{{#property:P1448}}'') is the [[Romanian language]] edition of [[Wikipedia]], the free [[encyclopedia]]. Started in July 2003, as of {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAMEGEN}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} this edition has about [[:ro:Special:Statistics|{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|ro|N}} articles]] and is the 25th largest Wikipedia edition.&lt;ref&gt;[[:meta:List of Wikipedias|List of Wikipedias]]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2004, users on the Romanian Wikipedia started to talk about founding a local chapter of Wikimedia, ''[[:meta:Wikimedia România|Asociaţia Wikimedia România]]''.

==History==

The first articles in the Romanian Wikipedia were written in July 2003, with the first version of the main page being drafted on 12 July. The user interface, initially in English, started being translated into Romanian by Bogdan Stăncescu (registered with the username Gutza) as soon as he was given sysop rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marc.info/?l=intlwiki-l&amp;m=105827975414697&amp;w=2 International Wiki mailing list]&lt;/ref&gt; The same user subsequently contacted several [[List of universities in Romania|Romanian universities]] that were available on the internet, as well as the [[Romanian Academy]], in order to attract new contributors. His efforts were soon remarked by the Romanian media, who invited him on several occasions to introduce the project to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Acasă.ro, 16 December 2004: [http://stiri.acasa.ro/stiri/Enciclopedie-gratis-pe-Internet-in-romana_--s9291.html Enciclopedie gratis pe Internet, în română]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} ''Bănăţeanul'', 24 July 2004: [http://www.banateanul.ro/articol/ziar/timisoara/informatie-la-click/2694/ Informaţie la click]&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2003, the Romanian Wikipedia had exceeded 3,000 articles, ranking 16th among all Wikipedias. The 10,000th article was written on 13 December 2004, and the 50,000th on 5 January 2007.

In April 2004, the Romanian Wikipedia supported the launch of the [[:roa-rup:|Aromanian Wikipedia]]  (see [[Aromanian language]]).

In June 2004, the Romanian Wikipedia encountered problems concerning its division and the creation of a separate [[:mo:|Moldovan Wikipedia]] (see [[Moldovan language]]). A Moldovan language version of Wikipedia exists as it was created automatically together with a larger number of other Wikipedias, because the language had been assigned a separate [[ISO 639]] code (''mo/mol''&amp;mdash;which were deprecated in November 2008 by the ISO authorities&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_changes.php&lt;/ref&gt;). At its beginnings, it worked as a portal redirecting to the Romanian Wikipedia, but in March 2005, it eventually began allowing content (although only intended for Cyrillic Moldovan/Romanian as it was used before 1989 in the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian SSR]] and remains in use only in [[Transnistria]]), starting big editing wars and endless discussion. Starting from December 2006 it is frozen and editing is no longer permitted. This question is still raised from time to time, although users on Wikipedia voted on its closure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects/Closure_of_Moldovan_Wikipedia Vote and discussion on the closure of Moldovan Wikipedia] on Meta-Wiki&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanian Wikipedia reached the 100,000 article milestone on 11 January 2008. As of April 2015, it has 300,000 articles and 330,000 registered users, of which 21 are administrators.

==Peculiarities==

The logo of the Romanian Wikipedia was slightly different from the logos of other Wikipedias. The letter ''[[И]]'' in the logo was replaced with the Romanian letter ''[[Ă]]'' (A-breve), further adapting this Wikipedia to the local readership.&lt;ref&gt;[[:m:Ştiri#3 aprilie 2004|2004 news report]] on [[Meta-Wiki]] {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles can contain small spelling variations, mostly regarding the use of the letters ''â'' and ''î'', both used for the [[close central unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/ɨ/}} (cf. [[Romanian alphabet]]). According to the 1993 spelling rules promoted by the [[Romanian Academy]], {{IPA|/ɨ/}} is transcribed as either ''î'', when used as the first or last letter of words, or ''â'', when it occurs in the middle of the word (with some exceptions). Still, between 1953 and 1993, the Romanian language only used ''î'' - after 1964 an exception was made for derivations of the words ''România'' ("Romania"), ''român'' ("Romanian") and related words. The Academy rules are mandatory in government organisations and in state schools in [[Romania]]. [[Moldova]] adopted the Latin alphabet for the Romanian language before the spelling reform in 1993, and it didn't switch to the new spelling up until 2001, using the letter ''î'' before exclusively (exceptions were made for ''România'' and the other related words, spelled with ''â''). In practice, either usage is acceptable in both countries, and indeed there are publishing houses and printed magazines that use either or both of the two rules. [[Vojvodina]] uses the new Romanian spelling. Other spelling differences include ''sunt''/''sînt'' or ''niciun''/''nici un''. The Romanian Wikipedia community adopted a language policy stating that both pre-1993 and post-1993 spelling norms are permitted, and editing an article just to switch it from one norm to the other is not acceptable; switching is allowed if the article is significantly expanded or rewritten.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ro:Wikipedia:Versiuni de ortografie română|Versions of Romanian spelling]] (official policy) on the Romanian Wikipedia {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the addressing policy, Romanian Wikipedia uses the polite forms of the personal pronouns and verbs. A policy on this was discussed in early 2006, and consensus was reached for the use of ''dumneavoastră'' (polite "you") instead of ''tu'' (familiar "you") on its pages.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ro:Discuţie Wikipedia:Sondaje/Politica de adresare|Addressing policy]] (discussion and policy) on the Romanian Wikipedia {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sila''' (also called '''Sida''') is a [[Loloish language]] spoken by 2,000 people in Laos and Vietnam (Bradley 1997). Sila speakers are an officially recognized group in Vietnam, where they are known as the [[Si La people|Si La]].

==Distribution==
According to Edmondson (2002), the Sila number about 700 people in Vietnam and live in the following 3 villages.

*Seo Hay, Can Hồ Commune, [[Lai Châu Province]], Vietnam
*Xì Theo Chai, Can Hồ Commune, [[Lai Châu Province]], Vietnam
*Nậm Sín, Mường Nhé Commune, [[Điện Biên Province]], Vietnam

According to the elderly Sila, seven Sila families had emigrated from Mường U and Mường Lá of [[Phongsaly Province]], Laos 175 years ago. They initially arrived at a location called Mường Tùng, and relocated several times before arriving at their present locations.

In Laos, Sila is spoken in:&lt;ref&gt;https://mpi-lingweb.shh.mpg.de/numeral/Sila.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surface feet per minute''' ('''SFPM''' or '''SFM''') is the combination of a [[physical quantity]] (''surface speed'') and an [[imperial units|imperial]] and [[United States customary units|American customary]] unit (''feet per minute''). It is defined as the number of [[linear feet]] that a location on a rotating component travels in one minute. Its most common use is in the measurement of [[speeds and feeds#Cutting speed|cutting speed (surface speed)]] in [[machining]]. It is a [[unit of measurement|unit]] of [[velocity]] that describes how fast the cutting edge of the [[cutting tool (machining)|cutting tool]] travels. It correlates directly to the [[machinability]] of the workpiece material and the [[hardness]] of the cutting tool material. It relates to [[spindle (tool)|spindle]] speed via variables such as cutter diameter (for rotating cutters) or workpiece diameter (for [[metal lathe|lathe]] work).

SFM is a combination of ''diameter'' and the ''velocity'' ([[revolutions per minute|RPM]]) of the material measured in feet-per-minute as the [[spindle (tool)|spindle]] of a [[milling machine]] or [[lathe]]. 1 SFM equals 0.00508&amp;nbsp;m/s  (meter per second, the [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of speed). The faster the spindle turns, and/or the larger the diameter, the higher the SFM. The goal is to tool a job to run the SFM as high as possible to increase hourly part production. However some materials will run better at specific SFMs. When the SFM is known for a specific material (''ex 303 annealed stainless steel = 120 SFM for high speed steel tooling''), a formula can be used to determine spindle speed for live tools or spindle speeds for turning materials.

In a milling machine, the ''tool'' diameter is substituted for ''stock'' diameter in the following formulas when the cutter is revolving and the stock is stationary.

Spindle Speed can be calculated using the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Spindle speed (RPM)} = \frac{SFM}{\pi \times \frac{1}{12} \times \text{stock diameter (in)}} \approx \frac{SFM}{0.2618 \times \text{stock diameter (in)}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;Brown &amp; Sharpe; Brown &amp; Sharpe Automatic Screw Machine Handbook'', Publisher B&amp;S&lt;/ref&gt;

SFM can be calculated using the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;SFM = \text{stock diameter (in)} \times \pi \times \frac{1 (ft)}{12 (in)} \times \text{RPM} \approx \text{stock diameter (in)} \times 0.2618 \times \text{RPM}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;

The '''Ten Commandments of Free Men''' was a proclamation published by Dr. [[Ramón Emeterio Betances]] in November 1867 in order to encourage [[Puerto Ricans]] to aspire to independence from [[Spanish colonial]] rule.

"''Puerto Ricans''

''The government of Mme. [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] throws upon us a terrible accusation.''

''It states that we are bad Spaniards. The government defames us.''

''We don't want separation, we want peace, the union to Spain; however, it is fair that we also add conditions to the contract. They are rather easy, here they are:''

''The abolition of slavery''

''The right to vote on all impositions''

''Freedom of religion''

''Freedom of speech''

''Freedom of the press''

''Freedom of trade''

''The right to assembly''

''Right to bear arms''

''Inviolability of the citizen''

''The right to choose our own authorities''

''These are the Ten Commandments of Free Men.''

''If Spain feels capable of granting us, and gives us, those rights and liberties, they may then send us a General Captain, a governor... made of straw, that we will burn in effigy come [[Carnival]] time, as to remember all the [[Judas Iscariot|Judases]] that they have sold us until now.''

''That way we will be Spanish, and not otherwise.''

''If not, Puerto Ricans - HAVE PATIENCE!, for I swear that you will be free.''"

&lt;ref&gt;Ojeda Reyes, ''El Desterrado de París'', p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciudadseva.com/textos/otros/10manda.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tiruvalla copper plates''' are the inscriptions found at the [[Sreevallabha Temple]], [[Tiruvalla]], South India, dating back to twelfth century, although it is also said that certain sections were written during the tenth century&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Perumāḷs of Kerala: Brahmin Oligarchy and Ritual Monarchy : Political and Social Conditions of Kerala Under the Cēra Perumāḷs of Makōtai|last=Narayanan|first=M. G. S.|publisher=CosmoBooks|year=2013|isbn=9788188765072|location=|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They are often  regarded as a classic specimen of medieval documentation in [[Kerala]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

The central theme of the writings on these copper plates are concerned with the management of resources for specific rituals in the temple&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. It was first published in Travancore Archeological Series by [[T. A. Gopinatha Rao|T A Gopinatha Rao]], under the tite ''The Huzur Treasury Plates Belonging to the Visnu Temple At Tiruvalla''. The Tiruvalla copper plates consist of forty four plates, but at least seven plates are missing&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

The Moozhikkulam Kacham is mentioned in the Tiruvalla copper plates which points to the fact that the Moozhikulam Kacham was not restricted to checking the corruption of Ooralanmar. A condition in the inscription is that Idangazhi (a measuring vessel) of [[ghee]] should be provided for the thiruvamrithu (special savouring) to the God. The karalan who defaults it should pay 50 kazhanju gold to the king, 25 kazhanju gold to the Oorala sabha and 12.50 kazhanju gold to the ruler.

It can be learned from the inscriptions that the karalan paid paattam (rent) to the owners in the rates 2/5, 1/5 and 1/3. The wordings "kadappanangadu bhoomiyum aalum" and "kuzhikkaattu bhoomiyum aalum" point to the fact that there were permanent workers for each farmland.

The inscription says that 27,105 paras (a measuring vessel) of paddy were required for the kedavilakku and naivedyam rituals of the temple. Free education, food and accommodation were given to over 100 chithiranmar (meaning Brahmin students) at the Tiruvalla Salai.

The inscription says that 350 nazhi (a measuring vessel) of rice was spent a day for the meals of around 175 chithiranmar during Onam. The temple had [[paddy field]] where 12,634 kalam (one kalam = 10 para) paddy was sown for feeding the [[Brahmin|Brahmins]]. The inscription also has indications on a hospital which functioned along with the temple.

'''Uday Bhembre''' is an Indian lawyer, Konkani writer and a former member of the [[Goa Legislative Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-04-01/goa/28017649_1_north-goa-south-goa-ramakant-angle LS polls: Parties play the usual faith cards]&lt;/ref&gt; He is noted for his role as the editor of the [[Konkani language|Konkani]] daily, ''[[Sunaparant]]'', and as a Konkani language activist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-11-21/goa/28087596_1_roman-script-n-shivdas-devnagari Panel suggests notifications, FIRs in Konkani]&lt;/ref&gt; Bhembre is also widely known as the lyricist of the famed [[Goan]] [[Konkani language]] song [[Channeache Rati]].

==Early life==
Uday Bhembre was born in [[Zambaulim]], a village in South Goa. He is the son of eminent freedom fighter Laxmikant Bhembre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldgoa.in/Edit/Opinions/The-Brahmin-double-in-Goan-history/93127.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
After his early education in Goa, Bhembre went to Bombay (now [[Mumbai]]) in 1957 for pursuing higher education. Bhembre is an alumnus of Mumbai's Siddharth College. He joined Mumbai's [[Akashvani (radio broadcaster)]] centre and became a lyricist. Bhembre is a lawyer by profession.

==Activism==
Bhembre has been a vociferous advocate for the cause of Konkani language. He played a great role in various movements related to the language.

In the [[Goa Opinion Poll]], Bhembre campaigned against Goa's merger with [[Maharashtra]]. At that time, Bhembre authored a column in the popular anti-merger Marathi newspaper ''Rashtramat''. In his column entitled ''Bhahmastra'', Uday Bhembre campaigned for the anti-merger camp and his column played a great role in influencing the Goans in supporting the anti-merger camp.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goanews.com/news_disp.php?newsid=5597&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhembre was also a leader of the [[Konkani language agitation]], and he played a great role in the movement which led to the enactment of the Goa, Daman and Diu Official Language Act, 1987. This Act made Konkani as Goa's official language.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goanews.com/news_disp.php?newsid=5597&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhembre also played a role in Konkani's inclusion to the Eight Schedule of the Indian Constitution and in granting [[Sahitya Akademi]]'s recognition to Konkani as an independent language.

Uday Bhembre is a leader of the ''Bharatiya Bhasha Suraksha Manch'' (Indian Languages' Protection Organisation- BBSM). This ''Manch'' has been set up in Goa to oppose the state government's decision to grant aid to primary schools imparting education in English. Bhembre and the BBSM demand that government grants be allotted to only those educational institutions which provide primary education in the students' mother tongue, i.e., Konkani and Marathi.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldgoa.in/Goa/English-will-suffocate-and-stunt-growth-of-children-Bhembre/91710.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldgoa.in/Edit/People-Edit/Medium-of-Instruction-issue/92053.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navhindtimes.in/moi-issue-bbsm-describes-bjp-govt-as-gang-of-liars/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navhindtimes.in/stop-grants-to-english-schools-from-next-year-bbsm/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navhindtimes.in/bbsm-to-stage-dharna-over-grant-in-aid-on-december-19/&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhembre was also the President of the ''Konkani Bhasha Mandal''.&lt;ref&gt;http://konkanibhashamandal.com/?page_id=61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books authored==
Bhembre neglected creative writing in order to take ahead the Konkani movement at social and organisational level. Bhembre's articles in ''Rashtramat'' have been composed into a book entitled ''Brahmastra'' (his column in ''Rashtramat'' bore the same title). '''', a collection of his select poems and songs, has also been published.

Bhembre's ''Karna Parv'' (कर्णपर्व) was awarded the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]]. He also served as the editor of the now defunct Konkani language newspaper, ''[[Sunaparant]]''.

==Member of Legislative Assembly==
In the 1984 elections to the Goa, Daman and Diu Legislative Assembly, Uday Bhembre was pitched as an independent candidate by the united opposition in [[Margao]], against [[Indian National Congress]] party's Anant Narcinva ''Babu'' Nayak.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldgoa.in/Goa/The-story-teller-of-Mathgram-to-Margao/87498.html&lt;/ref&gt; Bhembre defeated Nayak and became a member of the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elections.in/goa/assembly-constituencies/1984-election-results.html&lt;/ref&gt; Bhembre played a great role in the framing of the Goa, Daman and Diu Official Language Act, 1987.

[[File:Vin jaune 13.jpg|right|thumb|Ullage is the headspace of air between the wine and the top of the container (such as this barrel).]]
'''Ullage'''  (from the [[French (language)|French]] ''ouillage'') is a [[winemaking term]] that has several meanings but most commonly refers to the headspace of air between [[wine]] and the top of the container holding the wine. It can also refer to the process of [[evaporation]] that creates the headspace itself or it can be used as a [[past tense]] [[verb]] to describe a wine barrel or bottle that has gone through the evaporation process (''to be ullaged'', etc.). The headspace of air is a mixture mostly of [[alcohol]] and [[water vapor]]s with [[carbon dioxide]] that is a by-product of the [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] process. In containers that are not completely [[Hermetic seal|air-tight]] (such as an [[oak (wine)|oak wine barrel]] or a [[cork (material)|cork]]-stoppered [[wine bottle]]), [[oxygen]] can also seep into this space. While some oxygen is beneficial to the [[aging (wine)|aging process of wine]], excessive amounts can lead to [[oxidation]] and other various [[wine fault]]s. This is why wine in the barrels is regularly "topped up" and refilled to the top with wine in order to minimize the head space. In the bottle, the ullage or "fill level" of the wine can be an important indicator of the kind of care and [[storage conditions (wine)|storage conditions]] that the wine was kept in. After-market resellers and [[wine auction]] houses will often inspect the ullage levels of older [[vintage]]s to determine the potential quality and value of wine.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 270, 702 &amp; 718"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 270, 702 &amp; 718 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the barrel==
[[File:Col Solare red band barrels.JPG|left|thumb|The "red band" seen on many wine barrels is from wine spill. Some of this spillage comes from the topping off process when the bung is reinserted into the barrel.]]
At the winery, the natural process of evaporation creates ullage in the barrel by causing some of the alcohol and water particles to escape as [[vapor]]s, a loss sometimes referred to as the "[[angel's share]]". If the wine is in a container that is not completely air-tight, these vapor molecules (along with carbon dioxide) will [[Molecular diffusion|diffuse]] out of the container through openings in the wood and around the [[bung]] and be replaced with oxygen molecules. While some oxygen is beneficial in the maturation and break-down of some [[phenolic compounds (wine)|phenolic compounds]] such as [[tannins (wine)|tannin]], excessive amounts of oxygen can interact with ''[[Acetobacter]]'' present in the wine and start the process of turning the wine into [[vinegar]]. To prevent this possible oxidation and spoilage wineries will regularly "top up" the barrels by replacing the lost liquid with new wine.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 270, 702 &amp; 718"/&gt;

The exact method and timing of topping up a wine barrel is determined by the individual wineries and can depend on the type of wine or [[grape variety]] that is being produced. A barrel can be topped off anywhere from once a week to every month and a half. The position of the barrel can affect the speed and degree of evaporation and the need for topping up. If the barrel is sitting with its bung hole on top, [[aeration]] and evaporation occurs more quickly. If the barrel is turned to the side in the ''bung over'' position, the bung is kept moist with the wine and aeration occurs at a slower pace. The wine that is replaced during the topping up is usually the same wine taken from another smaller container (such as a [[carboy]]) with the barrel filled to the very top to where the reinsertion of the bung causes some spillage.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 270, 702 &amp; 718"/&gt;

==In the bottle==
[[File:Margaux bottles.JPG|right|thumb|An assortment of aged Bordeaux wine with various ullage levels.]]
The ullage level of a wine bottle is sometimes described as the "fill level". This describes the space between the wine and the bottom of the [[bung|cork]]. During the [[bottling]] process, most wineries strive to have an initial ullage level of between 0.2–0.4&amp;nbsp;inches (5–10mm). As a cork is not a completely airtight sealant, some wine is lost through the process of evaporation and diffusion. As a wine ages in the bottle, the amount of ullage will continue to increase unless a wine is opened, topped up and [[recorked]]. If the wine is stored on its side, in contact with the cork, some wine will also be lost by [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] into the cork with longer corks having the potential to absorb more wine (and thus create more ullage) than shorter corks.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 270, 702 &amp; 718"/&gt;

Generally the greater the amount of ullage, the more potential that the wine has been exposed to harmful levels of oxidation. This is why auction houses and retailers of mature wines pay close attention to the ullage levels in determining the resale value of the wine. The ullage level can also give insight as to the type of care and storage condition that the wine was kept in. Wines that have been kept at ambient [[humidity]] levels and in temperatures between 50–59°F (10–15°C) will experience evaporation and diffusion at a slower rate than wine kept in lesser conditions and will thus have a lower ullage levels. Ullage levels are generally important to the likelihood of almost any wine being in good shape.  Vintage Port might be slightly less prone to damage since it is fortified, but the only wines that can not be damaged by oxidation are Madeira wines, which are already oxidized.

There are standard descriptions used by wine merchants and auction houses for the fill levels (ullage levels) of wine. The fill levels descriptions are different for Bordeaux and Burgundy wines due to the different shape of the bottles from those two regions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wine-Searcher]] "Bottle Fill Level Abbreviations - http://www.wine-searcher.com/fill-level.lml"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadbent's ullage guide===
[[File:Bordeaux Fill Levels.svg |thumb|Commonly used terms for ullage of Bordeaux bottles.  (Capsule line appears to indicate depth of cork.)]]
In the late 1980s, [[Master of Wine]] and senior consultant of [[Christie's]] auction [[Michael Broadbent]] developed a guide for evaluating the ullage levels of matured wines. While the focus of his guide was primarily on Bordeaux, it has been generally accepted and widely used in the wine market as an evaluation tool for all sorts of wine. The terms are used to describe the levels of wine in a wine bottle.  They are commonly used to describe old wine bottles offered for sale in [[wine auction]]s and by dealers in rare wine. Despite the guide's popularity, Broadbent has been quoted as regretting his decision not to [[copyright]] it.&lt;ref name="Miscellany"&gt;G. Harding ''"A Wine Miscellany"'' pg 33, Clarkson Potter Publishing, New York 2005 {{ISBN|0-307-34635-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uropi''' is a [[constructed language]]  which was created by Joël Landais, a French English teacher. Uropi is a synthesis of European languages, explicitly based on the common [[Proto-Indo-European roots|Indo-European roots]] and aims at being used as an [[international auxiliary language]] for Europe and thus contributing to building a European identity. Besides, given the spread of [[Indo-European languages]] outside Europe (today half the world population speaks an I-E language).

Uropi was begun in 1986; since then, it has undergone certain modifications; its vocabulary keeps growing (the French-Uropi dictionary has over 10,000 words).

Uropi became known in Europe in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Ducos, Étienne, «''Joël Landais invente la 251e langue''», in ''Libération'', October 16, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bremer, Hans-Hagen, «''Vok vu Uropi: Ein Lehrer träumt nachts auf europäisch''» in ''Frankfurter Rundschau'', November 24, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Долгополов, Николай, «''Уроки Уропи''» in ''Комсомольская Правда'', November 21, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Étienne Ducos, «''Des lettres russes arrivent par centaines chez Joël Landais''», in ''L'Écho républicain'', December 15, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Paul, «''Uropi, the new lingua franca''», in ''The Guardian Weekly'', week of January 15, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Enrico, «''Uropi, una nuova lingua per l'Europa''», in ''La Stampa'', February 24, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tabone, Bénédicte, «''L'Uropi n'est pas une utopie''», in ''La Nouvelle République du Centre Ouest'',  July 2, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Author not mentioned,  «''Uropi, mehr als eine private Geheimsprache - Ein Chance in Europa''» in ''Tagespost'', October 28–29, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Долгополов, Николай, «''Мы снова говорим на разных языках''» in ''Комсомольская Правда'', April 29, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hrabovský, Jiří, «''Vok vu Uròpi?

==Creator==
[[File:UK2.jpg|thumb|Joël Landais, ''Uropi Kreator'', creator of the auxlang Uropi.]]
After studying languages at the [[University of Orléans]], then at the [[Sorbonne]] and at the ''École Normale Supérieure'' in Paris, Joël Landais obtained the [[Agrégation]] diploma in English. He speaks French, English, Italian, Spanish, German and has a working knowledge of modern Greek and Russian. Today, he teaches English in a [[Chartres]] college. Parallel to his training as a linguist, his travels throughout Europe, Senegal, the Maghreb, Egypt, Mexico, former USSR, Vietnam and the West Indies, together with a passion for languages, led him to create Uropi.

The Uropi alphabet has 26 letters, the 26 letters of the [[ISO Basic Latin alphabet]] minus q, plus the  letter ʒ, which comes from the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]. Each letter corresponds to a sound and each sound to a letter.

All consonants are pronounced as in English except
* c = {{IPAlink|ʃ|[}}, which is always pronounced as ''sh''
* g = {{IPAlink|g|[}}, which is always pronounced as in "give"
* j = {{IPAlink|j|[}}, which is pronounced as y in "you" or "boy"
* [[ʒ]] = {{IPAlink|ʒ|[}} which is pronounced as ''s'' in "pleasure, measure, leisure"
* r = {{IPAlink|r|[}}, which is rolled as in Italian, Spanish or [[Scottish English|Scottish]]
* s = {{IPAlink|s|[}}, which is always pronounced as ''s'' in "this" or ''ss'' in "boss'", and never as ''z''.
* x = {{IPAlink|x|[}}, used in foreign names, [https://www.facebook.com/groups/uropi/permalink/1536687813017246/?comment_id=1537560332929994&amp;reply_comment_id=1537581006261260]
* y = {{IPAlink|y|[}}, used in foreign names, [https://www.facebook.com/groups/uropi/permalink/1536687813017246/?comment_id=1537560332929994&amp;reply_comment_id=1537581006261260]

The [[vowels]] ''a, e, i, o, u'' are pronounced as in Italian or Spanish: ''casa, solo, vino, luna, pepe''. [[stress (linguistics)|Stress]] normally falls on the [[Root (linguistics)|main root]]. For example, in ''apkebo'' = to behead, the stress falls on ''keb'' = head. However some suffixes (such as ''-èl'' indicating an instrument) and the ending ''-ì'' for the past are always stressed; when two or more suffixes are combined, the stress always falls on the penultimate suffix (the last but one). The stress is marked with a written accent (à è ì ò ù) on the stressed vowel when it falls on the last syllable. For example: ''kotèl, perì, fotò, menù'' = "knife, carried, photo, menu".

==Vocabulary==

===Roots===
Uropi [[Root (linguistics)|roots]] can be divided into three categories:

====Indo-European roots====
First and foremost Uropi claims to be a way to recreate a unity between [[Indo-European languages]]. With this aim, a great many Uropi roots correspond to common Indo-European roots which have been simplified, in their pronunciation and length (very often Uropi roots have one or two syllables). Thus, mother is ''mata'' (from Indo-European: ''mātēr*''); sun is ''sol'' (from Indo-European: ''sāwel*''). This simplification corresponds to the natural evolution of Indo-European roots which have given birth to the words which are used today in modern I-E languages. Thus ''mata'' corresponds to Hindi ''mata, sol'' to Spanish and Scandinavian ''sol''.

===="Hybrid" roots====
When there is no common Indo-European root or when there are several roots to express the same reality in various languages, Uropi may use "hybrid" words, crossing two different roots taken from different languages so as to create the most easily recognizable term for speakers of the greatest number of Indo-European languages. Thus, in ''liamo'', to love, the ''li-'' comes from [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] languages (cf [[German language|German]] ''lieben'' and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''liubit''), and the ''-am'', from [[Romance language|Latin languages]] (''amo, amare, amar''); or in ''mand'', hand, the ma- comes from [[Romance language|Latin languages]] and the -and, from [[Germanic language]]s. This process is not so artificial as it seems at first sight: It has been observed in natural languages, for example, the [[French language|French]] ''haut'' (high) comes from the crossing between old Fr. ''aut'' (from Latin ''altus'') and [[Old Frankish|Frankish]] ''hōh''. It has also been deliberately used in languages like English to form new words: "[[portmanteau]]-words", for instance, the famous London "smog" comes from the crossing of '"smoke" and "fog". Let us also mention the words '''franglais'' (Fr = ''français'' + ''anglais''), ''denglisch'' (Ger. = ''deutsch'' + English), ''spanglish'' (US = Spanish + English). These "hybrid" words only account for 3% of Uropi vocabulary.

====International words====
Uropi also uses many words which are already "international", like ''taksì, skol'' (school), ''bus, art, matc'' (match), ''polìz'' (police), ''simfonij'' (symphony), and ''tabàk'' (tobacco).

===Compounds===
As many other [[conlangs]], Uropi uses many [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]], either combining two roots, or using [[prefixes]] and [[suffixes]].
Among the former, there are the following examples: ''lucitòr'', "lighthouse", from ''luc'', "light" and ''tor'', "tower"; or, with ''sopo'', "to sleep", ''sopisàk'', "sleeping-bag", or ''sopivagòn'', "sleeper" (train).

There are also numerous examples of compounds built with prefixes or suffixes: for example with ''davo'', "to give", ''disdavo'', "to distribute", can be formed; with ''tel'', "goal, purpose", ''atelo'', "end up in, come to", can be formed; with ''breko'', "to break", and ''us'', "out", ''usbreko'', "to break out", can be formed; with ''apel'', "apple", ''aplar'', "apple tree", and ''aplaria'', "apple orchard", can be formed.

In most cases, those compounds reveal the roots and thus the meaning of the compound. However, some of those compounds, even if they follow the [[etymology]] of equivalent words in living European languages, have a more obscure, rather metaphorical meaning. Thus, ''ruspeko'', literally "to look back", means "to respect"; or ''incepo'', literally "to seize, to grasp inside, means "to understand".

==Grammar ==

===Substantives ===
Like some modern [[Indo-European languages]], Uropi has a very limited [[declension]] with only two [[Grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative]] and [[genitive]] in the [[Grammatical number|singular]] and the [[plural]].
Uropi [[noun|substantives]] are divided into three groups: those ending in a [[consonant]], those ending in ''-a''  and those ending in another [[vowel]].

Among those ending in a consonant are all [[Masculine (grammar)|masculine]] [[nouns]], ''i.e.,'' nouns denoting men or male animals: ''man'': "man"; ''kat'': "(tom)cat".  

Those nouns take an -e in the plural; the genitive singular is marked with an ''-i'', and the genitive plural with ''-is'': ''man, mane, mani, manis'' = "man, men, man's, men's".

All [[Feminine (grammar)|feminine]] nouns, ''i.e.,'' nouns denoting women or female animals end in ''-a'': ''ʒina'': "woman"; ''kata'': "(she)cat". These nouns take an '''-s''' in the plural. The ''-a'' becomes ''-u'' in the genitive singular, ''-us'' in the genitive plural: ''gala, galas, galu, galus'' = "hen, hens, hen's, hens'".

All the other substantives are neuter: they can equally end with a consonant or with an ''-a'': for example, ''tab'': "table", ''ment'': "mind", or ''teatra'': "theatre", ''centra'': "centre". They correspond to the neuter personal pronoun ''je'' = "it".

The nouns ending with another vowel are essentially "international" words like ''taksì, eurò, menù''. They take an ''-s'' in the plural, but no specific mark in the genitive.

===Adjectives===
As in English, qualifying [[adjectives]] are invariable. They are placed before the noun they qualify. Some are "pure" adjectives: ''bun'': "good"; ''glen'': "green", ''kurti'': "short", others are derived from nouns. In this case, their form is identical to that of the genitive singular: ''mani'': "manly, man's"; ''ʒinu'': feminine, "woman's".

A few quantitative [[Quantifier (linguistics)|indefinite adjectives]] which are also [[pronouns]] take an ''-e'' in the plural: ''mol, mole'' = "much, many", ''poj, poje'' = "little, few", ''tal, tale'' = "every, all", ''ek, eke'' = "some, a few".

===Pronouns===
[[Personal pronouns]] have three [[Grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative]], [[accusative]] (also used with all [[prepositions]]) and [[Dative case|dative]]. [[Possessive determiner|Possessive adjectives]] are used for the [[genitive]]. As in English, there are three pronouns in the third person singular (masculine: ''he''; feminine: ''ce''; [[Grammatical gender|neuter]]: ''je'') as well as a [[reflexive pronoun]]. For example: ''i'' = "I" (nominative), ''ma'' = "me" (accusative), ''mo'' = "to me" (dative), ''tu, ta, to'' = "you", etc.

List of personal pronouns: ''i, tu, he, ce, je, nu, vu, lu'' = "I, you ''(singular)'', he, she, it, we, you ''(plural &amp; polite form)'', they". Reflexive pronoun: ''sia'' = "oneself".

===Verbs===
Uropi [[verbs]] have [[indicative]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]] and [[conditional mood|conditional]] moods, as well as a simple form, a [[progressive aspect|durative]] (continuous) form and a [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] form.
* Except in the [[Imperative mood|imperative]], the verbal form remains the same whatever the person.
* The [[infinitive]] ending is ''-o'': ''jedo'': "to eat", ''sopo'': "to sleep", ''avo'': "to have".
* The form of the [[present tense|simple present]] is that of the radical: ''i jed'': "I eat", ''tu sop'': "you sleep".

At seven, when I go to bed,

I  find such pictures in my head :

Castles with dragons prowling round,

Gardens where magic fruits are found ;

Fair ladies prisoned in a tower,

Or lost in an enchanted bower ;

While gallant horsemen ride by streams

That border all this land of dreams

I find, so clearly in my head

At seven, when I go to bed.

At seven, when I wake again,

The magic land I seek in vain ;

A chair stands where the castle frowned,

The carpet hides the garden ground,

No fairies trip across the floor,

Boots, and not horsemen, flank the door,

And where the blue streams rippling ran

Is now a bath and water-can ;

I seek the magic land in vain

At seven, when I wake again.

'''Wallisian''', or '''{{okina}}Uvean''' ({{lang-wls|Faka{{okina}}uvea|links=no}}), is the [[Polynesian language]] spoken on [[Wallis (island)|Wallis]] (also known as {{okina}}Uvea). The language is also known as '''East Uvean''' to distinguish it from the related [[West Uvean language]] spoken on the outlier island of [[Ouvéa]] near [[New Caledonia]]. The latter island was colonised from Wallis Island in the 18th century.

Wallisian may be most closely related to [[Rennellese language|Rennellese]]. It is also closely related to [[Tongan language|Tongan]], though part of the [[Samoic languages|Samoic]] branch, and has borrowed extensively from Tongan due to the Tongan invasion of the island in the 15th and 16th centuries. Uvea was settled about 3,000 years ago. &lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Nancy J. Rethinking Western Polynesia, 'Uvea in the Early Tongan Empire. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
==Alphabet==
The standard 5 vowels: a, e, i, o, u, with their lengthened variants: ā, ē, ī, ō, ū.

The consonants: f, g (always pronounced as ŋ (ng)), h, k, l, m, n, p, s (rare, usually from foreign words), t, v, '.

The ''{{okina}}'', representing the [[glottal stop]] (see also [[ʻOkina|okina]]), is known in Wallisian as ''fakamoga'' (belonging to the throat). The fakamoga is nowadays taught at schools, and can be written with straight, curly or inverted curly apostrophes. Similarly the [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] (Wallisian: ''fakaloa'', 'to lengthen') is now taught in schools to mark long vowels, even though the older generation has never marked the glottal stop or vowel length.

For example: ''Mālō te ma'uli'' (hello)

=== Registers ===
In Wallisian, there are three registers: the honorific language is used by both commoners and royals themselves. The royalty use it as it is the chiefly language and the commoners use it when talking to either a royal or when talking to God. The honorific language is also used by commoners when talking about God or about a royal figure regardless of their presence. The second language is the commoner language which is what is considered “ordinary” Wallisian, and finally there is vulgar or derogatory language. For example, the word for “to remain” in honorific, commoner, and vulgar registers are respectively {{Lang|wls|‘afio}}, {{Lang|wls|nofo}}, &amp; {{Lang|wls|tagutu}}. Each of the three are used in their respective circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Blixen, Olaf. El Lenguaje HonoríFico En Uvea (Wallis) y Sus Conexiones En Polinesia Occidental. Moana, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and classification ==
[[File:Wallis, Futuna, Samoa, Tonga, Niue, Fidji (Polynésie ancestrale) multilingue.svg|thumb|Wallisian comes from [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] and belongs to the Nuclear Polynesian subgroup (''map''). However, due to its massive [[Tongan language|Tongan]] influence, its has been sometimes classified as a Tongic language.]]
Wallisian is a [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian language]] that comes from [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hawaiki, Ancestral Polynesia: An Essay in Historical Anthropology|last=Kirch|first=Patrick Vinton|author2=Roger Green|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-521-78309-5|pages=99–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its classification has been a subject of debate among scholars. Due to its proximity with [[Tongan language]], Wallisian has sometimes been classified within the tongic subgroup (Elbert, 1953)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|lang=de|author=Akihisa Tsukamoto|title=Forschungen über die Sprachen der Inseln zwischen Tonga und Saamoa|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|year=1994|pages=109|isbn=3825820157|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=ZQVriuXhE8AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=fr&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|passage=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but later linguists stated it belonged to the Nuclear Polynesian group: Pawley and Green (1966), Bruce Biggs (1978) and Jeffrey Marck (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|lang=en|author1=Jeffrey Marck|title=Topics in Polynesian languages and culture history|place=Canberra|publisher=Pacific Linguistics|year=2000|url=http://www.jeffmarck.net/publications/Marck-2000-PolynesianLanguageCultureHistory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closest langage to Wallisian is the [[Niuafoʻou language|Niuafo'ou language]], spoken on the island of [[Niuafoʻou|Niuafo'ou]] (Northern Tonga, Niuas group). Intercomprehension is very high between those two languages, due to intense contacts between both islands until the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/10027|title=The language of Niuafo'ou Island|last=Tsukamoto|first=Akihisa|publisher=Australian National University|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=2, 8|type=Doctoral Thesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence from other languages==

=== Influence from Tongan ===
Wallisian is related to [[Rennellese language|Rennellese]]. It is also closely related to [[Tongan language|Tongan]], because of former Tonga invasions in Wallis. For instance, the past form "ne'e" comes from Tongan{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}. Wallisian is very closely related to Tongan, while Futunan is more closely related to [[Samoan language|Samoan]]. 

=== Influence from English ===
During the 19th century, a form of [[pidgin]] English was used by Wallisians to communicate with traders, mainly due to the fact that the natives of Wallis and Futuna had a lot of contact with [[New England (New South Wales)|New England]] whaling ships as they frequently stopped at Wallis and Futuna. Currently, there are about 70 pidgin words that are still in use on Wallis island. In 1937 however an infestation of coconut beetles on Wallis island scared many of the trade partners of Wallis island whom happened to have been mainly English. Trade to Fiji for example was halted because of the infestation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Loanwords included european foods (''laisi'' : rice, ''suka'': sugar) and objects (''pepa'': paper), but also some animals (''hosi'': horse)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Raymond|date=1973|title=Un millier de légendes aux îles Wallis et Futuna et divers centres d'intérêt de la tradition orale|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/jso_0300-953x_1973_num_29_38_2413|journal=Journal de la Société des océanistes|language=fr-FR|volume=29|issue=38|pages=69–100|doi=10.3406/jso.1973.2413|issn=0300-953X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influence from English grew stronger after the American army set a military base on the island in 1942. Loanwords such as ''puna'' (spoon), ''motoka'' (car, from ''motor car''), ''famili'' (family), ''suka'' (sugar), ''peni'' (pen), ''tini'' (tin),  etc. have integrated the Wallisian language.

=== Influence from Latin ===
When the missionaries came, they also introduced many [[Latin]] words, mainly for religious purposes. Jesus Christ was rendered into ''Sesu Kilisito'', words like ''komunio'' (communion), ''kofesio'' (confession), ''temonio'' (devil, from ''demonio'', fr ''démon''), but also some non religious vocabulary : ''hola'' (time, hour (lat. ''hora'')) ; ''hisitolia'' (history (lat. ''historia'')) were introduced and are now part of the everyday Wallisian language. Not all religious words have been borrowed, though. Missionaries also tried to use existing concepts in Wallisians and give them a new Christian meaning. Thus ''Tohi tapu'' ("sacred book") refers to the Bible, while ''aho tapu'' ("holy day") means Sunday and ''Po Tapu'' ("sacred night") is Christmas; the concept of Trinity was translated into ''Tahitolu tapu'' which literally translates to "one-three holy". Missionaries also introduced the days of the week into the language, using the [[Names of the days of the week#Numbered days of the week|Latin ecclesiastical style of naming weekdays]] with ''feria'' (translitterated into ''felia''), much like in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

Claire Moyse-Faurie explains that in Wallisian, "loanwords conform to the syllabic structure by inserting an epenthetic vowel into the cluster and by either adding a final vowel or eliminating the final consonant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?hl=fr&amp;lr=&amp;id=bIC9ubBxYtQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA325&amp;dq=east+uvean&amp;ots=G-hNaNMcB0&amp;sig=SPTqqmwjv1qPt9BbXBCvw7_MHCk#v=onepage&amp;q=east%20uvean&amp;f=false|title=Aspects of Language Contact: New Theoretical, Methodological and Empirical Findings with Special Focus on Romancisation Processes|last=Stolz|first=Thomas|last2=Bakker|first2=Dik|last3=Palomo|first3=Rosa Salas|date=2008-08-27|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=|isbn=9783110206043|location=|pages=328|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence from French ===
Wallisian has been heavily influenced by [[French language|French]]. French missionaries arrived at the end of the 19th century; in 1961, [[Wallis and Futuna]] became a [[Overseas territory (France)|French oversea territory]] and French is now the [[official language]]. According to many linguists such as  Dr Karl Rensch,  French did not affect much the language in the beginning but is now profoundly transforming Wallisian{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}. Many [[neologisms]] have been created by transliterating French words into Wallisian, as in the vocabulary of politics. Words such as ''Falanise'' (France), ''Telituale'' (Territory), ''politike'', (politics), ''Lepupilika'' (Republic)..., many technical words (''telefoni'', ''televisio''...), food that was brought in Wallis by the Europeans (''tomato'', ''tapaka'' (tobacco, from fr ''tabac'', ), ''alikole'' (alcohol), ''kafe'' (coffee, from fr ''café'')), etc. are borrowings from French.

In 1984, Karl Rensch stated that more and more French loanwords were entering the Wallisian language&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=French, Wallisian|author1=Karl H. Rensch|title=Tikisionalio Fakauvea-Fakafalani - Dictionnaire wallisien-français|publisher=Archipelago Press|year=1984|isbn=|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Karl_Rensch,_Dictionnaire_wallisien-fran%C3%A7ais_(1984).pdf?uselang=fr|pages=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; . In the 2000s, young people have started mixing both languages in their speech&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://la1ere.francetvinfo.fr/wallisfutuna/langues-maternelles-qu-pensent-jeunes-wallis-futuna-561495.html|title=Langues maternelles : qu'en pensent les jeunes de Wallis et Futuna? - Wallis et Futuna la 1ère|last=|first=|date=|work=Wallis et Futuna la 1ère|access-date=2018-10-12|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

-French influence in Uvea can be seen through media and in schools. French was even implemented as a primary and secondary school language since 1961, reinforcing the French governmental dominance over the island. During the year 1968-1969 when a Wallisian was caught speaking in his native language in school they would be forced to wear a tin corned beef lid as a necklace and then write an hour long French composition during the weekend marked by the French teacher. When the next student were to be caught speaking Wallisian then necklace would be passed on to them but whoever holds the necklace will have to wear it until someone else is caught speaking their suppressed native language. &lt;ref&gt;Talatini, Filihau Asi., et al. Uvea / Uvea / Written by Filihau Asi Talatini ... [and Others] ; Edited by Elise Huffer and Mikaele Tui ; Translation from French to English by Neil Carruthers. Institute of Pacific Studies, University of the South Pacific], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the French influence on Wallis island about half of the media is in French and constantly available while for example some news stations and television programs in Wallisian are only available once a week and are usually at the and of week which discourages people from watching them since they would have already seen the news earlier in the week. This only leads to people interacting more with the French language and feeling more discouraged to learn Wallisian. Some parents even discourage the learning of Wallisian in nursery and primary schools calling the language a waste of time to learn. &lt;ref&gt;Talatini, Filihau Asi., et al. Uvea / Uvea / Written by Filihau Asi Talatini ... [and Others] ; Edited by Elise Huffer and Mikaele Tui ; Translation from French to English by Neil Carruthers. Institute of Pacific Studies, University of the South Pacific], 2004.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationships between Wallisian and Futunan ===
Despite being two different polynesian languages, Wallisian and Futunan are similar enough to one another that knowing one language makes it much easier to learn the other as well.

Many Wallisians see themselves as superior to Futunans, such as reinforcing stereotypes claiming that Wallisian is easy while Futunan is a difficult language to pronounce. These stereotypes arise from the fact that since Wallis island was chosen as the administrative center for the French and as the seat of the Catholic bishop. Wallis island enjoyed more benefits from France and hence Wallisian became dominant to Futunan, especially since Futuna island lacked the educational resources that Wallis island could provide in the 1990s&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rensch|first=Karl|date=1990|title=The Delayed Impact: Postcolonial Language Problems in the French Overseas Territory Wallis and Futuna (Central Polynesia)|url=|journal=Language Problems and Language Plan|volume=14|pages=224-236|doi=10.1075/lplp.14.3.03ren|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A highly educated Futunan is typically expected to be trilingual is French, Futunan, &amp; Wallisian. Only by being trilingual in all three can a Futunan retain the pride of Futuna island while being able to have the opportunity to advance economically and educationally on Wallis island.

=== The language debate: the Church and the French administration ===
The natives of Wallis islands and Futuna were able to get very close to the Catholic missionaries as the missionaries stayed, learned the native languages Wallisian and Futunan, and the missionaries created schools in order to educate the young and encourage young men to join the priesthood. The natives of the islands had a poor relationship with administrative officials since administrators only stay for two to three years before being moved elsewhere, this causes administrators to typically not learn local languages as they had very little use for it being exposed for such a relatively short period of time compared to the missionaries. The natives being close to the Catholics however caused the locals to begin learning Latin words which they began to incorporate into their own language, especially in religious settings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

This rift between the clergy and the administration was seen all the way in France where anticlericalism was widespread. French politicians and church officials had been having difficulties agreeing with one another. The clergy for example found very little to no reason to impose the French language of the natives of Wallis and Futuna, however Paris demanded that the islands learn the language and an agreement between French politicians and the Catholic church was made. French would be taught two hours a day, four times a week, and as long as French classes did not interfere with Catholic studies. In 1959 when the islands of Wallis and Futuna joined the French republic as an overseas territory the educational system changed dramatically. The Catholic church lost control of the educational system to the French politicians who ordered teachers of the French language from France to teach French on the islands. Most of these teachers had very little experience teaching French as a second language and the change in the educational system led to a sociolinguistic split, younger generations became more or less bilingual while the older generations had a very little grasp of the French language. French teachers on the Wallis and Futuna islands were in a similar position as the French administrators. French teachers only taught for two to three years before their teaching contract ended and they are moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Having similar opinions to the priests the French teachers were asked about their experience when returning to France and they usually said that teaching French on the islands was a waste of time as only few people saw the need for the locals to become fluent in French. As the debates over how the people should be educated continued, Wallisians realized the cultural importance of their language and found a new desire to protect it by attempting to standardize the language, creating social media/entertainment in Wallisian rather than in French (despite the fact that most media comes from France anyways), and by making Wallisian a school subject.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As the French missionaries arrived in 1837 spreading Latin language, the natives became weary of a loss of Wallisian culture. The natives of Wallis islands began to have Wallisian classes for middle school children, and when the community obtained F.M. &amp; A.M. transmitters the community began operating radio channels specifically in Wallisian.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''ǁXegwi''', also known as ''Batwa,'' is an [[List of extinct languages|extinct]] [[Tuu languages|ǃKwi language]] spoken at [[Lake Chrissie]] in [[South Africa]], near the [[Swaziland|Swazi]] border. The last known speaker, Jopi Mabinda, was murdered in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Traill, A. "The Khoesan languages", in Mesthrie, Rajend ''Language in South Africa'', Cambridge U.P., 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, a reporter for the South African newspaper [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] reports that ǁXegwi may still be spoken in the [[Chrissiesmeer]] district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-06-24-the-secret-pool-of-surviving-bushmen-at-chrissiesmeer|title=The secret pool of surviving Bushmen at Chrissiesmeer|last=Davie|first=Kevin|work=The M&amp;G Online|access-date=2018-03-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ǁXegwi name for their language has been spelled ''giǁkwi:gwi'' or ''kiǁkwi:gwi.''  Their name for themselves has been transcribed ''tlou tle'' or ''kxlou-kxle'', presumably {{PUA|{{IPA|[k&amp;#xf268;ouk&amp;#xf268;e]}}}}.  The Nguni (Zulu and Swazi) called them ''(a)batwa, amaNkqeshe, amaNgqwigqwi''; the Sotho called them ''Baroa/Barwa''.&lt;ref&gt;Yvonne Treis, 1998, "Names of Khoisan Languages and their Variants"&lt;/ref&gt;

ǁXegwi lost the abrupt clicks (the various manners of [[palatal click|{{IPA|ǂ}}]] and [[alveolar click|{{IPA|ǃ}}]]) found in its relatives. It reacquired {{IPA|ǃ}} from [[Nguni languages|Nguni]] [[Bantu languages]], but clicks remained relatively infrequent, compared to other Tuu languages. It also had a series of [[uvular consonant|uvular]] [[plosives]] not found in other Tuu languages.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Traill, 1999. ''Extinct South African Khoisan Languages''.&lt;/ref&gt;
