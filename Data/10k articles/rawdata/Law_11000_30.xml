      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10888">'''African Consensus''' is an [[Economics|economic]] [[paradigm]] proposed in 2011 for [[sustainable development]] in [[Africa]]. It is built on practical experiences across the African continent together with shared experiences from other regions facing similar challenges. It merges existing efforts of [[civil society]] in such areas as [[renewable energy]], community finance and empowerment, [[Organic farming|organic agriculture]] and [[water resource management]], [[Environmental protection|environmental]] and [[endangered species]] protection. It couples these with the [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] experiences of business and finance in an attempt to scale these efforts into viable [[economic model]]s. Seeking a pragmatic path for development, it emphasizes the importance of heritage, cultural and identity protection with the need for economic advancement.&lt;ref name="Rio20"&gt;{{cite web|title=AFRICA CONSENSUS STATEMENT TO RIO+20 |url=http://www.nepad.org/system/files/COncensus-english.pdf |website=The Africa Regional Preparatory Conference for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) |publisher=The New Partnership For Africa's Development |accessdate=15 November 2014 |location=Addis Ababa, Ethiopia |date=25 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127144827/http://www.nepad.org/system/files/COncensus-english.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--the misspelling is embedded in the document filename only--&gt;

==African Consensus Forum==
The African Consensus Forum is proposed as an annual event, chaired by [[Tanzania]]'s president [[Jakaya Kikwete]], to convene stakeholders from civil society, government, business and finance. It is intended to address major challenges of development and present a range of concrete experiences, as well as to outline practical solutions that are economically viable and scalable. The annual meeting will initially be held in [[Dar Es Salaam]] with plans for breakout meetings alternating in the five regional zones during the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forum Charter|url=http://africanconsensus.org/foundation-documents/forum-charter/|website=African Consensus|publisher=African Consensus Forum|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==African Consensus Crisis Prevention Center==
The African Consensus Crisis Prevention Center is an anticipated outcome of the Africa Consensus Forum to address crises of violence, which may arise over allocation of resources and resource benefits. African Consensus Forum will seek to anticipate crisis situations and offer a [[Track II diplomacy|second track dialogue process]] toward economic solutions to prevent crisis. The center's work will be hosted by the secretariat. It should coordinate efforts with those initiatives ongoing in the [[African Union]], and other initiatives active on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Onuoha|first1=B|title=Power, conflict and consensus building in Africa: Ideology revisited|journal=African Journal on Conflict Resolution|date=2011|volume=11|issue=2|url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajcr/article/view/69829|accessdate=15 November 2014|issn=1562-6997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The African Consensus concept emerged during the 2011 [[World Social Forum]] held in [[Dakar]], Senegal. Drafting of the African Consensus Resolution was undertaken by [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] leaders working throughout the event (late January and throughout February 2011). Key spokespersons of the process were West African celebrity rapper [[Didier Awadi]] who is known for his outspoken activism, and Alioune Tine who has been a peace mediator in both [[Darfur]] and [[Ivory Coast]]. Leaders of the African branch of the World Social Forum were also deeply involved in the process.&lt;ref name="himalayanconsensus"&gt;{{cite web|title=African Consensus Resolution|url=http://www.himalayanconsensus.org/african+resolution|website=Action for Ethnic Diversity and Cultural Sustainable Development|publisher=Himalayan Consensus|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laurence Brahm]] was invited by these activists to help articulate the concepts and draft the original African Consensus Declaration that was tabled before the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (ACHPR) NGO Forum two months later. The African Consensus Declaration was adopted by the ACHPR Forum in [[Gambia]], in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights|url=http://www.achpr.org|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2014}}

The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]] picked up on the ideas in the declaration and held a drafting session in October 2011 to draft a document called "African Consensus Statement to Rio+20". It was presented at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (Rio+20) during the conference summer 2012, incorporating the vision into the ideas of inclusive sustainability promoted by the UN system. The two documents – ''African Consensus Declaration'' and the ''African Consensus Statement to Rio+20''&lt;ref name="Rio20"/&gt; – underpin the economic paradigm by building a body of internationally recognized documentation.

In summer 2014, Tanzania's president Jakaya Kikwete summoned Laurence Brahm (the original drafter of the African Consensus Declaration) together with John Masuka (Tanzania's "father of inclusive finance") to the northern State House in [[Dodoma]]. There President Kikwete explained his own intention to convene the African Consensus Forum as a multi-stakeholder process between civil society, business-finance and government. Kikwete was one of the original conveners of the Helsinki Process, in his previous role as Tanzania's foreign minister. The [[Helsinki Process on Globalisation and Democracy]] calls for multi-stakeholder participation in resolving political and leadership challenges. By convening the African Consensus Forum as an extension of the Helsinki Process, Kikwete extended that process from the realm of governance to economics. The Uongozi Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UONGOZI Institute|url=http://www.uongozi.or.tz/|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a leadership organization that is an outcome of the original Helsinki Process, is the body where the African Consensus Institute is to be located. Expectations are for the African Consensus to convene each year in early December.

There is increasing recognition of the notion that Africa must have its own unique economic development paradigm created by Africans themselves. The view has increasingly shifted from the NGO and civil society networks to the mainstream. Books such as ''African Consensus'' by [[Ludger Kühnhardt]], published in 2014, and articles by Kwame Marfo in ''Neo-African Consensus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MARFO|first1=KWAME|title=DEAR GOD: Why are we so poor?|url=http://neoafricanconsensus.wordpress.com/2012/04/01/dear-god-why-are-we-so-poor/|website=Neo-African Consensus|publisher=Neo-African Consensus|accessdate=15 November 2014|date=April 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Towards a just and sustainable world'' by CIDSE further attest to a global paradigm shift in the development narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nnaemeka|first1=Abonyi Nichodemus|title=Towards an Alternative Development Paradigm for Africa|journal=J Soc Sci|date=2009|volume=21|issue=1|pages=39–48|url=http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/JSS/JSS-21-0-000-09-Web/JSS-21-1-000-09-Abst-PDF/JSS-21-1-039-09-707-Nnaemeka-A-N/JSS-21-1-039-09-707-Nnaemeka-A-N-Tt.pdf|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core principles and rights==
The African Consensus economic paradigm is based on three core principles:&lt;ref name="himalayanconsensus"/&gt;
#Protect [[Multiculturalism|ethnic diversity]], [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous identity]], endangered species and environment; 
#Through community empowerment involving local financing for sustainable and [[socially responsible business]]es; 
#Prioritizing environmental protection and community advancement.

African Consensus seeks to protect three core [[rights]]:&lt;ref name="himalayanconsensus"/&gt;
#The right to ethnic diversity 
#The right to culturally sustainable development 
#The right to water, food security and the protection of our natural environment.

African Consensus can be a framework for preventing [[violence]] and [[terrorism]], which are often rooted in both economic and social marginalization of people from different identity groups.&lt;ref name="himalayanconsensus"/&gt;

==Core theme==
It is proposed that African Consensus will be built upon the pan-African visions articulated by Mwalimu [[Julius Nyerere]] and [[Kwame Nkrumah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shivji|first1=Issa G|title=Nyerere, nationalism and Pan-Africanism|url=http://www.pambazuka.net/en/category/features/71793|website=Pambazuka News|publisher=Fahamu|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with regard to the global context the challenges of [[global warming|climate change]] and [[Resource depletion|diminishing resources]] as they relate to [[Developing country|developing countries]]. It is intended that it will adopt the multi-stakeholder approach of the Helsinki Process, and hopefully extending that process from politics and governance into the realms of economics, business and finance.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Foundation documents==
African Consensus is established as an economic paradigm based on two documents:
#''The African Consensus Declaration'' adopted by the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights NGO Forum convened in Banjul, Gambia, April 2011{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
#''The African Consensus Statement to Rio+20'' submitted by the Economic Commission on Africa jointly with the African Union, African Development Bank, UN ECOSOC, UNDEP and UNEP to the Rio+20 conference in Brazil, July 2012.&lt;ref name="Rio20"/&gt;

On the basis of these two documents African Consensus is intended to evolve during future African Consensus Forum meetings where stakeholders in the African continent – from civil society, business, finance, and government – will convene each year, with regional break-out meetings throughout the year, to define and articulate the aspirations and pathways to African development based on pragmatism, and experiences shared between stakeholders.

The African Consensus Forum "Green-print" will be the annual outcome document of each African Consensus Forum to serve as a [[green growth]] blueprint of development and a continuing reference of best practices articulated by the stakeholders each year.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1388">The '''Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act''' ('''ABLA''') of the [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988]], {{USStatute|100|690|102|4181|1988|11|18}}, {{USBill|100|HR|5210}}, is a [[United States federal law]] requiring that (among other provisions) the labels of alcoholic beverages carry a government warning.

The warning reads:

{{quote|GOVERNMENT WARNING:

(1) According to the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]], women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects.

(2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate {{sic|hide=y|machinery, and}} may cause health problems.}}

The ABLA also contains a declaration of policy and purpose, which states that the [[United States Congress]] finds that

{{quote|the American public should be informed about the health hazards that may result from the consumption or abuse of alcoholic beverages, and has determined that it would be beneficial to provide a clear, nonconfusing reminder of such hazards, and that there is a need for national uniformity in such reminders in order to avoid the promulgation of incorrect or misleading information and to minimize burdens on interstate commerce.}}

The '''Atomium''' ( {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|t|oʊ|m|iː|ə|m}} {{respell|ə|TOH|mee-əm}}) is a landmark building in [[Brussels]], originally constructed for the 1958 Brussels [[World's fair|World's Fair]] ([[Expo 58]]). It is located on the [[Heysel Plateau]], where the exhibition took place. It is now a museum.&lt;ref name="Official website"/&gt;

Designed by the engineer [[André Waterkeyn]] and architects André and Jean Polak,&lt;ref name="Official website"&gt;[http://www.atomium.be/#/History.aspx Official website]&lt;/ref&gt; it stands {{convert|102|m|abbr=on}} tall. Its nine {{convert|18|m|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} diameter [[stainless steel|stainless-steel]]-clad [[sphere]]s are connected, so that the whole forms the shape of a [[crystal structure#Unit cell|unit cell]] of an [[iron]] [[crystal]] magnified 165 billion times. Tubes of {{convert|3|m|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} diameter connect the spheres along the 12 edges of the cube and all eight vertices to the centre. They enclose stairs, escalators and a lift (in the central, vertical tube) to allow access to the five habitable spheres, which contain exhibit halls and other public spaces. The top sphere includes a restaurant which has a [[panorama|panoramic]] view of Brussels.

==Subject==
[[File:Cubique centre atomes par maille.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|An equivalent depiction of the [[Crystal structure#Unit cell|body-centred cubic unit cell]] of an [[iron]] [[crystal]]. If this unit is repeated millions of times in every direction, the structure of the entire iron crystal is shown.]]
In the 1950s, faith in scientific progress was great, and a structure depicting [[Atom|atoms]] was chosen to embody this. The Atomium depicts nine [[iron]] atoms in the shape of the body-centred cubic [[Crystal structure#Unit cell|unit cell]] of an iron [[crystal]], magnified 165 billion times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://atomium.be/History.aspx|publisher=Atomium Foundation|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Atomium depicts an iron unit cell, the balls were originally clad with [[aluminium]]. Following the 2004–2007 renovations, however, the aluminium was replaced with [[stainless steel]], which is primarily iron. Likewise, while the subject of Atomium was chosen to depict the enthusiasm of the [[Atomic Age]], iron is not and cannot be used as fuel in [[Nuclear reaction|nuclear reactions]].

== Construction and exhibition ==
The Atomium was built as the main pavilion and icon of the [[Expo 58|1958 World's Fair of Brussels]]. The construction of the Atomium was a technical feat. Of the nine spheres, six are accessible to the public, each with two main floors and a lower floor reserved for service. The central tube contains the fastest [[elevator]] of the time at {{convert|5|m/s||abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, installed by the Belgian branch of the Swiss firm Schlieren (subsequently taken over by [[Schindler Group|Schindler]]). It allows 22 people to reach the summit in 23 seconds. The [[Escalator|escalators]] installed in the oblique tubes are among the longest in Europe. The biggest is {{convert|35|m||abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long. 

Three of the four top spheres lack vertical support and hence are not open to the public for safety reasons, although the sphere at the pinnacle is open to the public. The original design called for no supports; the structure was simply to rest on the spheres. [[Wind tunnel]] tests proved that the structure would have toppled in an {{convert|80|km/h||abbr=on|sigfig=1}} wind ({{convert|140|km/h||abbr=on|sigfig=1}} winds have been recorded in Belgium). Support columns were added to achieve enough resistance against overturning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0000887|title=Atomium (1958) &amp;#124; Structurae|date=24 February 2006|publisher=En.structurae.de|language=de|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Atomium, designed to last six months, was not destined to survive the 1958 World's Fair, but its popularity and success made it a major element of the Brussels landscape. Its destruction was therefore postponed year after year, until the city's authorities decided to keep it. However, for thirty years, little maintenance work was done.&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Renovation==
By the turn of the [[3rd millennium|millennium]], the state of the building had become quite deteriorated and a comprehensive renovation was sorely needed. Renovation of the Atomium began in March 2004; it was closed to the public in October, and remained closed until 18 February 2006. The renovations included replacing the faded [[aluminium]] sheets on the spheres with [[stainless steel]]. On 21 December 2005, the new Atomium outdoor lighting was tested. The meridians of each sphere were covered with rectangular steel plates, in which [[LED lamp|LED lighting]] was integrated. The LED application illuminates the bulbs at night. The lights can also flash simultaneously or in turns at each meridian, symbolising the range of an electron around its core. 

On 14 February 2006, the Atomium was officially reopened by then [[Philippe of Belgium|Prince Philippe]], and on 18 February 2006, it opened again to the public. The renovation cost €26 million. Brussels and the Atomium Association paid one-third of the costs, the [[Federal Government of Belgium|Belgian government]] financed two thirds. To help pay for renovations, pieces of the old aluminium plates were sold to the public as souvenirs. One triangular piece about {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long sold for €1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://veerle-v2.duoh.com/blog/comments/the_atomium_restored/ |title=The Atomium restored |date=16 February 2006 |publisher=Veerle Pieters |accessdate=20 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923194316/http://veerle-v2.duoh.com/blog/comments/the_atomium_restored/ |archive-date=23 September 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the occasion of the reopening, a [[2 euro commemorative coins#2006 coinage|2 euro commemorative coin]] depicting the building was issued, in March 2006, to celebrate the renovation.&lt;gallery&gt;

* the third and central spheres have a versatile vocation and allow the organisation of various events, films, concerts, parties or conferences;
* the top sphere, in addition to the panorama, holds a restaurant;
* the sixth sphere is the children's ball, intended for the organisation of workshops of urban pedagogy, allowing the children from six to twelve years to spend the night there.

== Worldwide copyright claims ==

On 23 February 2009, Axel Addington, web content manager for Atomium, emailed a clarification to the Glass Steel and Stone website, which some years earlier redacted its photographs of the Atomium after being threatened. He stated:

{{Quote|The royalties are perceived {{sic}} by the descendants of André Waterkeyn, the engineer who conceived Atomium in 1955, and not by the A.S.B.L Atomium. So, you've probably been sued by the SABAM (Belgian Copyright Company) because of the Waterkeyn Family.}}

From the Atomium's website, the current copyright restrictions exempt private individuals under the following conditions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atomium.be/Search.aspx?search=photo#/AuthorsRights.aspx Atomium.be copyright], retrieved 26 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|This is the case where photographs are taken by private individuals and shown on private websites for no commercial purpose (the current trend for photo albums).&lt;br /&gt;In accordance with legislation, usage rights for the image of the Atomium would naturally extend to 1st January 2076, in other words, the seventieth anniversary of André Waterkeyn's death.}}

In the summer of 2015, Belgian political party [[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|Open Vld]], proposed a bill to enable [[Freedom of Panorama]] in Belgium. The bill was enacted into law in June 2016, allowing pictures of the Atomium, and other public buildings under copyright, to be legally distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demorgen.be/binnenland/selfies-aan-atomium-weldra-helemaal-legaal-b7cd1c16/|title=Selfies aan Atomium weldra helemaal legaal|publisher=demorgen.be|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi/article_body.pl?language=nl&amp;caller=summary&amp;pub_date=2016-07-05&amp;numac=2016011277|title=Moniteur Belge - Belgisch Staatsblad|publisher=ejustice.just.fgov.be|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bobdownsite''' is the [[fluorine]] bearing mineral of the [[whitlockite]] group of [[phosphate minerals]] whose formula is Ca&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;(Mg)(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F). It is isotypic with whitlockite and was misidentified as such until proper chemical analysis. Whitlockites structure and relationships with other phosphate compounds has been extensively studied. Bobdownsite was first recovered from Big Fish River, Yukon, Canada from a Lower [[Cretaceous]] outcrop of bedded ironstones and shales. Bobdownsite is named after Robert Terrace Downs a professor of mineralogy in the Department of Geosciences at the University of Arizona, who lived and worked in the Yukon Territory in the 1970s.  Bobdownsite is unique because it is the first known naturally forming phosphate to contain a P-F bond.

Bobdownsite is closely related to whitlockite and [[merrillite]].

== Relationship of bobdownsite to other species ==

Member of the whitlockite group:&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

Other members of group:
*[[Ferromerrillite]]: Ca&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;NaFe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
*[[Hedegaardite]]:  (Ca,Na)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;(Ca,Na)Mg(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH)
*[[Merrillite]]: Ca&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;NaMg(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
*[[Strontiowhitlockite]]: Sr&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Mg(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)
*[[Tuite]]: Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
*[[Whitlockite]]: Ca&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Mg(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)

==Geological occurrences== 
Bobdownsite is originally found from Big Fish River, Yukon, Canada (about Latitude 68°28'N, Longitude 136°30'W). Bobdownsite occurs in a [[Vein (geology)|vein]] from an east- west- trending faulted vein. Samples recovered from this exposure are found with [[Lower Cretaceous]] bedded [[ironstone]]s and [[shale]]s. Bobdownsite is a phosphate mineral with its exposure downstream from  [[phosphate nodule]] slopes. The vein at the exposure is composed of anhedral and euhedral crystals and is 0 to 4&amp;nbsp;cm wide. It occurs associated with [[siderite]], [[lazulite]], [[kulanite]], [[gormanite]], [[quartz]] and [[collinsite]]. Bobdownsite has also been reported from the Tip Top mine of [[Custer County, South Dakota]]. Furthermore, it has been found with other witlockite group minerals in [[Martian meteorites]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tait, Kimberly T.,Madison C. Barkley, Richard M. Thompson, Marcus J. Origlieri, Stanley H. Evans, Charles T. Prewitt, and Hexiong Yang, "Bobdownsite, A New Mineral Species From Big FIsh River, Yukon, Canada, and Its Structural Relationship With Whitlockite-Type Compounds", The Canadian Mineralogist, 49.4 (2011): (1065-1078). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meteorites ===
Bobdownsite, whitlockite, and merrillite are all important phosphate minerals found closely related in lunar rocks. Merrillite crystals with considerable amounts of fluorine and traces of chlorine were found in several Martian meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;Gnos, E., et al. (2002): Sayh al Uhaymir 094: a new martian meteorite from the Oman desert: Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science 37, 835-854.&lt;/ref&gt; But more research conducted on bobdownsite suggests that an F content of greater that about 0.9 wt%, including F- bearing merrillite, is bobdownsite.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Physical properties==
In Yukon, Canada bobdownsite is found composed of anhedral and euhedral crystals, tabular, colorless in transmitted light, transparent, with a white streak and a vitreous luster. The Tip Top mine sample has [[Druse (geology)|druses]] of pale purple, yellow, or transparent colorless rhombohedral crystals, brittle, with a hardness about 5, no cleavage, parting or twinning, and an uneven and subconchoidal fracture. Bobdownsite has a density of 3.14 and 3.16 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and is insoluble in water, acetone, or hydrochloric acid.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Crystallography ===
Bobdownsite is isostructural with whitlockite having a trigonal crystal system and R3c space group. The point group is 3m with unit cell parameters ''ɑ'' 1.3224(3) Å, c 37.70(2) Å, ''V'' 3420.7(6) Å&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Bobdownsite has trigonal - ditrigonal pyramid&lt;ref name=Webmin/&gt; tabular, euhedral crystals. The mineral is characterized by [M(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt; ligands held together by intralayer Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations to form layers parallel to (001). The layers parallel to (001) are further linked by intralayer Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations along [001]. These ligands can be referred to as the "Mg pinwheel". The pinwheels are formed in closest packed planar arrangement using the term cubic eutaxy. For this arrangement to happen there are tetrahedral and octahedral sites. The octahedral sites contain PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F tetrahedral groups which are approximately in the midplane between the two pinwheel layers and are each coordinated to the closest two interlayer Ca cations by the oxygen. The P position in the PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F is located either just above or just below the midplane between the two pinwheel layers, leading to the F to point either along +c or -c. The metal of the whitlockite- type compounds is slightly offset from the origin along c and is octahedrally coordinated residing at the center of the M pinwheel. The layers stack in an ABAB fashion along the c, there is no obvious eutaxy, they can be described as chains of corner-sharing LiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra cross connected by PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F tetrahedra.

'''''Certiorari''''',{{efn|Pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɜːr|ʃ|ə|ˈ|r|ɛər|aɪ}}, {{IPAc-en|-|ˈ|r|ɛər|i}}, or {{IPAc-en|-|ˈ|r|ɑː|r|i}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/certiorari?r=66|title=Certiorari ! Define Certiorari at Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oxf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/certiorari|title=Definition of certiorari in Oxford dictionary (British &amp; World English)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} often abbreviated '''''cert.''''' in the United States, is a process for seeking [[judicial review]] and a [[writ]] issued by a court that agrees to review. A ''certiorari'' is issued by a [[superior court]], directing an inferior court, tribunal, or other public authority to send the record of a proceeding for review.

==Etymology==
The term comes from the words used at the beginning of these writs when they were written in Latin: ''certiorārī (volumus)'' "[we wish] to be made certain". ''Certiorari'' is the [[present tense|present]] [[passive voice|passive]] [[infinitive]] of the [[Latin]] verb ''certioro, certiorare'' ("to inform, apprise, show").&lt;ref name="oxf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dcertioro|title=Definition at Lewis and Short Latin Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical and modern jurisdictions==
Historical usage dates back to [[Roman Law]]. In modern law, ''certiorari'' is recognized in many jurisdictions, including [[Law of the United States|the United States]], [[English law|the United Kingdom]], [[Law of Canada|Canada]], India, and [[Philippine legal codes|the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/supremecourtcircular2-90.htm|title=Philippine Supreme Court Circulars|publisher=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library|accessdate=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}

In Roman law, ''certiorari'' was suggested in terms of reviewing a case—much as the term is applied today—although the term was also used in writing to indicate the need or duty to inform other parties of a court's ruling. It was a highly technical term appearing only in jurisprudential Latin, most frequently in the works of [[Ulpian]].

The term ''certiorari'' is often found in Roman literature on law but applied in a philosophical rather than tangible manner when concerning the action of review of a case or aspects of a case. Essentially, it states that the case will be heard.

===Common law and Commonwealth===
At [[common law]], ''certiorari'' was a supervisory writ, serving to keep "all inferior jurisdictions within the bounds of their authority ... [protecting] the liberty of the subject, by speedy and summary interposition".&lt;ref&gt;3 Wm. Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'' 42 (1765).&lt;/ref&gt; In England and Wales, and separately in Northern Ireland, the Court of [[King's Bench]] was tasked with the duty of supervising all lower courts, and had power to issue all writs necessary for the discharge of that duty; the justices of that Court appeared to have no discretion as to whether it was heard, as long as an application for a bill of ''certiorari'' met established criteria, as it arose from their duty of supervision.

{{quote|The underlying policy is that all inferior courts and authorities have only limited jurisdiction or powers and must be kept within their legal bounds. This is the concern of the Crown, for the sake of orderly administration of justice, but it is a private complaint which sets the Crown in motion.&lt;ref&gt;''Surya Dev Rai v. Ram Chander Rai'', (2003) 6 SCC 675 (India)(internal quotation omitted) [http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/1016548/ indiankanoon.org]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Associate Justice [[James Wilson]], the person primarily responsible for the drafting of [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;The Oyez Project, Justice James Wilson [http://oyez.org/justices/james_wilson] (last visited April 4, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; explains:

{{quote|In every judicial department, well arranged and well organized, there should be a regular, progressive, gradation of jurisdiction; and one supreme tribunal should superintend and govern all the others.

An arrangement in this manner is proper for two reasons:

# The supreme tribunal produces and preserves a uniformity of decision through the whole judicial system.
# It confines and supports every inferior court within the limits of its just jurisdiction.

If no superintending tribunal of this nature were established, different courts might adopt different and even contradictory rules of decision; and the distractions, springing from these different and contradictory rules, would be without remedy and without end. Opposite determinations of the same question, in different courts, would be equally final and irreversible.&lt;ref&gt;2 ''The Works of James Wilson'' 149–50 (J. D. Andrews ed., 1896).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Consistent with Justice Wilson's explanation, the power to issue writs of ''certiorari'' is invested in the highest court of every Commonwealth jurisdiction, in some way, shape, or manner. While some incorporate this remedy into their constitutions, e.g., India,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf India Const. art. 32, cl. 2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909000000/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |date=September 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; others treat it as an implied power of [[superior court]]s, e.g., Australia,&lt;ref&gt;''Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission'' {{Cite AustLII|HCA|1|2010}}; ''Klewer v Dutch'' {{Cite AustLII|FCA|509|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in all Commonwealth jurisdictions—as distinguished from their American counterpart—it has evolved into a general remedy for the correction of plain error, to bring decisions of an inferior court or tribunal or public authority before the superior court for review so that the court can determine whether to quash such decisions.&lt;ref&gt;''Anisminic Ltd v Foreign Compensation Comm'n'' [1969] 2 AC 147; [1969] 2 WLR 163 (Court may correct any lower court decision "depart[ing] from the rules of natural justice," per Lord Pierce) [https://web.archive.org/web/20010710163040/http://www.hku.hk/law/conlawhk/sourcebook/admlawcases/ANISMINIC.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|United States law}}

===United States===

====Federal courts====
In the [[Law of the United States|United States]], ''certiorari'' is most often seen as the writ that the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] issues to a lower court to review the lower court's judgment for legal error (reversible error) and review where no [[appeal]] is available as a matter of right. Before the [[Judiciary Act of 1891]],&lt;ref&gt;Ch. 517, 26 Stat. 826 (1891).&lt;/ref&gt; the cases that could reach the Supreme Court were heard as a matter of right, meaning that the Court was required to issue a decision in each of those cases.&lt;ref&gt;Russel R. Wheeler &amp; Cynthia Harrison, Fed. Judicial Ctr., Creating the Federal Judicial System 17–18 (3d ed. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the Court had to review all properly presented appeals on the merits, hear oral argument, and issue decisions. As the United States expanded in the nineteenth century, the federal judicial system became increasingly strained, and the Supreme Court, which routinely took three months off every year, not surprisingly had a backlog of cases several years long.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler &amp; Harrison, ''supra'', at 12, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act solved these problems by transferring most of the court's direct appeals to the newly created [[United States courts of appeals|circuit courts of appeals]], whose decisions in those cases would normally be final.&lt;ref&gt;Judiciary Act of 1891 §&amp;nbsp;6., 26 Stat. at 828.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court did not completely give up its judiciary authority, however, because it gained the ability to review the decisions of the courts of appeals at its discretion through writ of ''certiorari''.&lt;ref&gt;§&amp;nbsp;6, 26 Stat. at 828.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Judiciary Act of 1925]] and the [[Supreme Court Case Selections Act]] of 1988,&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court Case Selections Act, Pub.L. 100-352, 102 Stat. 662 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; most cases cannot be appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States as a matter of right. A party who wants the Supreme Court to review a decision of a federal or state court files a "petition for writ of certiorari" in the Supreme Court. A "petition" is printed in booklet format and 40 copies are filed with the Court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/ctrules/rulesofthecourt.pdf United States Supreme Court Rule] 33&lt;/ref&gt; If the Court [[Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States#Selection of cases|grants]] the petition, the case is scheduled for the filing of briefs and for oral argument. A minimum of four of the nine justices is required to grant a writ of ''certiorari'', referred to as the "[[rule of four]]". The court denies the vast majority of petitions and thus leaves the decision of the lower court to stand without review; it takes roughly 80 to 150 cases each term. In the term that concluded in June 2009, for example, 8,241 petitions were filed, with a grant rate of approximately 1.1 percent.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.]]'', 556 U.S. 868, __ (2009) ([[John G. Roberts|Roberts]], C.J., dissenting) (slip op. at 11). See also {{SCOTUS URL|about/justicecaseload.pdf}} (10,000 cases in the mid-2000s); Melanie Wachtell &amp; David Thompson, ''An Empirical Analysis of Supreme Court Certiorari Petition Procedures'' [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1377522 16 Geo. Mason U. L. Rev. 237], 241 (2009) (7500 cases per term); [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William H. Rehnquist]], [https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/speeches/sp_09-27-01.html Remarks at University of Guanajuato], Mexico, 9/27/01 (same).&lt;/ref&gt; Cases on the paid certiorari docket are substantially more likely to be granted than those on the ''[[in forma pauperis]]'' docket.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|ssrn=1377522|title=An Empirical Analysis of Supreme Court Certiorari Petition Procedures|year=2009|journal=George Mason University Law Review|pages=237, 249|volume=16|issue=2|last1=Thompson|first1=David C.|last2=Wachtell|first2=Melanie F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court is generally careful to choose only cases over which the Court has [[jurisdiction]] and which the Court considers sufficiently important, such as cases involving deep constitutional questions, to merit the use of its limited resources. See also [[Cert pool]]. While both appeals of right and cert petitions often present several alleged errors of the lower courts for appellate review, the court normally grants review only of one or two questions presented in a ''certiorari'' petition.

The Supreme Court sometimes grants a writ of ''certiorari'' to resolve a "[[circuit split]]", when the [[United States court of appeals|federal appeals courts]] in two (or more) [[United States federal judicial circuit|federal judicial circuits]] have ruled differently in similar situations. These are often called "percolating issues."

''Certiorari'' is sometimes informally referred to as ''cert.'', and cases warranting the Supreme Court's attention as "''cert.'' worthy".&lt;ref&gt;TIPTON V. SOCONY MOBIL OIL CO., INC., 375 U. S. 34 (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; The granting of a writ does not necessarily mean that the Supreme Court disagrees with the decision of the lower court. Granting a writ of ''certiorari'' means merely that at least four of the justices have determined that the circumstances described in the petition are sufficient to warrant review by the Court. 

Conversely, the Supreme Court's denial of a petition for a writ of ''certiorari'' is sometimes misunderstood as implying that the Supreme Court approves the decision of the lower court. However, as the Court explained in ''[[Missouri v. Jenkins]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-1823.ZS.html 515 U.S. 70] (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; such a denial "imports no expression of opinion upon the merits of the case[.]" In particular, a denial of a writ of ''certiorari'' means that no [[binding precedent]] is created by the denial itself, and the lower court's decision is treated as mandatory authority only within the geographical (or in the case of the Federal Circuit, subject-specific) jurisdiction of that court. The reasons for why a denial of ''certiorari'' cannot be treated as implicit approval were set forth in ''[[Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show, Inc.]]'' (1950), in which the Court explained the many rationales which could underlie the denial of a writ which have nothing to do with the merits of the case.

Since the vast majority of petitions for ''certiorari'' are routinely denied without comment, it is normally unnecessary to indicate that fact in citations to decisions of lower federal courts, unless it happened within the last two years or was otherwise particularly relevant (e.g., to support an inference that a particular appellant is a [[vexatious litigation|vexatious litigant]]).

In legal citations, "cert. granted ''sub nom''" is an abbreviation of the legal phrase "certiorari granted ''sub nomine''", meaning "judicial review granted, under name", indicating that a petition for ''certiorari'' of a case has been granted, but that the court granting ''certiorari'' is hearing the case under a different name than the name under which the subordinate courts heard the case. For example, the case of ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'' was known as ''Parker v. District of Columbia'' in the court below.

====State courts====
Some [[U.S. state|United States state]] court systems use the same terminology, but in others, ''writ of review'', ''leave to appeal'', or ''certification for appeal'' is used in place of ''writ of certiorari'' as the name for [[discretionary review]] of a lower court's judgment. A handful of states lack intermediate appellate courts; in most of these, their supreme courts operate under a mandatory review regime, in which the supreme court must take all appeals in order to preserve the loser's traditional right to one appeal (except in criminal cases where the defendant was acquitted). Virginia has an intermediate appeals court, but operates under discretionary review except in family law and administrative cases. Mandatory review remains in place in all states where the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]] exists; in those states, a sentence of death is automatically appealed to the state's highest court.

In two states without an intermediate appeals court—New Hampshire and West Virginia—the supreme court used to operate under discretionary review in all cases, whether civil or criminal. This meant that there was no right of appeal in either state, with the only exception being death penalty cases in New Hampshire. (West Virginia abolished its death penalty in 1965.) However, New Hampshire transitioned to mandatory review for the vast majority of cases beginning in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supreme Court - Judicial Duties|url=http://www.courts.state.nh.us/supreme/|website=New Hampshire Judicial Branch|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while West Virginia transitioned to mandatory review for all cases beginning in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stoneking|first1=Jay|title=State of West Virginia v. McKinley|url=http://www.wvscblog.com/opinion-analysis/state-west-virginia-v-mckinley/|website=West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals Blog|accessdate=16 November 2014|date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules of Appellate Procedure - Part III|url=http://www.courtswv.gov/legal-community/court-rules/appellate-procedure/Part-III.html|website=West Virginia Judiciary|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Texas is an unusual exception to the rule that denial of ''certiorari'' by the state supreme court normally does not imply approval or disapproval of the merits of the lower court's decision. In March 1927, the Texas Legislature enacted a law directing the [[Texas Supreme Court]] to summarily ''refuse'' to hear applications for writs of error when it believed the Court of Appeals opinion correctly stated the law.&lt;ref name="Steiner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steiner|first1=Mark E.|title=Not Fade Away: The Continuing Relevance of 'Writ Refused' Opinions|journal=The Appellate Advocate|date=February 1999|volume=12|pages=3-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, since June 1927, over 4,100 decisions of the [[Texas Courts of Appeals]] have become valid binding precedent of the Texas Supreme Court itself because the high court refused applications for writ of error rather than denying them and thereby signaled that it approved of their holdings as the law of the state.&lt;ref name="Steiner" /&gt; 

While Texas' unique practice saved the state supreme court from having to hear relatively minor cases just to create uniform statewide precedents on those issues, it also makes for lengthy citations to the opinions of the Courts of Appeals, since the subsequent writ history of the case must always be noted (e.g., no writ, writ refused, writ denied, etc.) in order for the reader to determine at a glance whether the cited opinion is binding precedent only in the district of the Court of Appeals in which it was decided, or binding precedent for the entire state.&lt;ref name="Steiner" /&gt; In contrast, California&lt;ref&gt;''Sarti v. Salt Creek Ltd.'', 167 Cal. App. 4th 1187, 85 Cal. Rptr. 3d 506 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; and New York&lt;ref&gt;''Mountain View Coach Lines, Inc. v. Storms'', 102 A.D.2d 663, 476 N.Y.S.2d 918 (2d Dept. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; solved the problem of creating uniform precedent by simply holding that the first intermediate appellate court to reach a novel question of law always sets binding precedent for the entire state, unless and until another intermediate appellate court expressly disagrees with the first one.

====Administrative law====
In the [[administrative law]] context, the [[common law|common-law]] writ of ''certiorari'' was historically used by lower courts in the United States for [[judicial review]] of decisions made by an [[administrative agency]] after an adversarial hearing. Some states have retained this use of the writ of ''certiorari'' in state courts, while others have replaced it with statutory procedures. In the federal courts, this use of ''certiorari'' has been abolished and replaced by a [[civil action]] under the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] in a [[United States district court]] or in some circumstances a petition for review in a United States court of appeals.

===Philippines===
The Philippines has adapted the extraordinary writ of ''certiorari'' in civil actions under its Rules of Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/courts/rules/rc_1-71_civil.html#r45|title=Rules of Court|website=www.lawphil.net|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13927">A '''changes clause''', in [[government contracting]], is a required clause in United States government construction contracts.{{definition needed|date=December 2017}}

==Background==
Cardinal Changes (Significant Changes) clauses are the source of a significant number of disputes arising from government contracts. The clause, which has appeared in nearly every U.S. government contract for over 100 years, gives the government the power unilaterally to order contractual modifications.&lt;ref&gt;4-15 Construction Law P 15.03&lt;/ref&gt;  If the parties are unable to agree on compensation to be received by the contractor for the modified work, the contractor shall be entitled to an [[equitable adjustment]]. ''''''The goal of an equitable adjustment is to place the contractor in the position he would have been in had the change not been encountered''''''. The adjustment should not alter the contractor's profit or loss position from what it was before the change occurred.&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Shea Co. v. United States, 10 Cl. Ct. 620 (1986). Where a contract was bid in a lump sum, the equitable adjustment for substitution of work is computed by the following formula: (1) Adjusted contract price; (2) Less projected cost without changed conditions; (3) Plus actual cost under changed conditions; (4) Plus reasonable profit/overhead computed in accordance with governing regulations on difference between 2 and 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Changes clause was first used in defense contracts where it was taken to be essential in time of war for the government to include new technologies without halting work to renegotiate the contract. Changes clauses are in almost all categories of government contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Vom Baur, The Origin of the Changes Clause in Naval Procurement,  8 Pub. Cont. L.J. 175 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;  If the Changes Clause is not incorporated in writing it is incorporated implicitly under the [[G.L. Christian and associates v. US|Christian Doctrine]] in almost&lt;ref&gt;See 4 No. 2 Nash &amp; Cibinic Rep. ¶ 13 ("In Aero Corp., ASBCA 8178, 1963 BCA ¶3665, the board refused to use the doctrine to insert the Changes clause in a purchase order.  In Jamsar, Inc., GSBCA 4396, 76-2 BCA ¶12053, the board refused to insert the Changes clause in a building services contract. Under the FAR, the Changes clause is a mandatory clause for almost all types of contracts.")&lt;/ref&gt; all U.S. government contracts, including FAR Part 12 contracts.

==Changes clauses for construction contracts in the Federal Acquisition Regulations==
There are three Changes clauses for construction contracts contained in the [[Federal Acquisition Regulations]]. One applies to fixed-price contracts, another to cost reimbursement contracts, and the third to time and materials or labor hours.&lt;ref&gt;48 C.F.R. § 52.243-1 (Fixed Price), 52.243-2 (Cost Reimbursement), 52.243-3 (Time and Materials).&lt;/ref&gt;

All three of these clauses give the government the right, at any time and without notice to the [[sureties]], to make changes in the work within the general scope of the contract. The clause for fixed-price contracts specifies that changes may be made to the specifications (including drawings and designs), the method or manner of performance, government-furnished facilities, equipment, materials, services, or site, or acceleration of the work. The clause for cost reimbursement contracts specifies that changes may be made to the "plans and specifications or instructions incorporated in the contract."

==Purposes==

The Changes clause accommodate several purposes. Either party may want to incorporate a technological advance. The Changes clause allows the contractor to propose changes to the work. This can result in more efficient contract performance. The Changes clause permits the government to ask for something new without the overhead of conducting a new [[procurement]].

The limitation of the government's right to make changes to those changes deemed to be "within the general scope of the contract" was for many years of great procedural significance in government contract litigation because, prior to the [[Contract Disputes Act of 1978]], a claim arising from such a change could not be brought to the various boards of contract appeals.&lt;ref&gt;41 U.S.C. § 601 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; This was because claims involving changes outside the general scope of the contract, sometimes called cardinal changes, were deemed to be breach of contract cases and had to be taken to the Court of Claims. The distinction between cardinal and other changes is no longer jurisdictionally significant because the Contract Disputes Act gives boards of contract appeals concurrent jurisdiction with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (formerly named the U.S. Claims Court&lt;ref&gt;Pursuant to the [[Court of Federal Claims Technical and Procedural Improvements Act]] of 1992, the name of the United States Claims Court was changed to the United States Court of Federal Claims. Pub. L. No. 102-572, § 902, 106 Stat. 4516 (effective Oct. 29, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;) over breach of contract cases.&lt;ref&gt;41 U.S.C. §§ 607(d), 609(a)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Whether a change is a cardinal change may, however, still be relevant to whether the contractor can unilaterally stop work pending resolution of a dispute,&lt;ref&gt;Edward R. Marden Corp. v. United States, 442 F.2d 364, 194 Ct. Cl. 799 (1971) ;  Gregory Lumber Co. v. United States, 9 Cl. Ct. 503, 518 (1986) ;  Gevyn Constr. Corp. v. United States, 11 Cl. Ct. 203 , aff'd, 827 F.2d 752 (Fed. Cir. 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; and the measure of damages that may be recovered.

As a quid pro quo for the government's unilateral right to order changes, the Changes clause gives the contractor a right to compensation.&lt;ref&gt;48 C.F.R. § 52.243-4(d).&lt;/ref&gt; If the parties are able to agree on the amount of the cost adjustment, they can execute a contract modification. If they are unable to agree, the contractor is entitled to an equitable adjustment in accordance with the cost principles contained in Part 31 of the FAR.&lt;ref&gt;See  C.B.C. Enters., Inc. v. United States, 24 Cl. Ct. 187 (1991) , aff'd, 978 F.2d 669 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (contractor cannot use the Eichleay formula when the government orders additional work and extends the performance period; home office overhead costs are covered by the mark-up on the direct cost of the extra work);  Appeal of A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., ENG BCA No. 5103, 91-3 B.C.A. (CCH) P 24,149 (1991) (subcontractor entitled to adjustment for extended home office overhead under Eichleay because it incurred delays caused by government-requested changes). See also  Satellite Elec. Co. v. Dalton, 105 F.3d 1418 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (evidence of a contractor's ability to take on other work during government-caused delay barred Eichleay damages). Note that the government was not required to prove that the contractor actually took on work during the suspension period, or to prove by a preponderance of the evidence his ability to do so. Cf. Appeal of Interstate Gen. Govt. Contractors v. West, 12 F.3d 1053, 1058 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (timely completion precludes recovery of unabsorbed overhead even where the government caused a suspension of performance, because the anticipated time of performance was not actually extended by the suspension).  Aircraft Gear Corp. v. Kaman Aero Corp., 875 F. Supp. 485, 496 (N.D. Ill. 1995) (damages must be unavoidable if the Eichleay formula is to employed).

In the case Togo D. West Jr. v. All State Boiler, Inc., 146 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1998), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit clarified the test for resolving unabsorbed overhead claims. All State distinguished Satellite, above, which many practitioners believed had ended Eichleay's vitality. Under All State, to avoid Eichleay, the government must show not only that a contractor sought additional work during a suspension and that the additional work was not part of the contractor's planned/normal stream of work, but was intended to replace the government-delayed project. In shifting the burden of proof, All State may have effectively overruled Satellite. See also Am. Renovation and Constr. Co., Inc. v. United States, 45 Fed. Cl. 44 (1999) (for a contractor to recover unabsorbed overhead, it must demonstrate that the government put the contractor on standby, required it to resume work at a moment's notice, and consequently precluded the contractor from taking on other work).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost reimbursement vs. fixed cost contracts==
The nature of the Changes clause for cost reimbursement contracts is somewhat different from that for fixed-price contracts because in the case of a cost reimbursement contract the contractor is already entitled to reimbursement for all of its reasonable costs and only needs an adjustment in the target price or the amount of its fee. The clause provides for such an adjustment to be made in the estimated cost, delivery or completion schedule, and the amount of any fixed fee.&lt;ref&gt;48 C.F.R. § 52.243-2(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of basic rules regarding the Changes clause that have been developed by the courts and boards of contract appeals over the years. One of the fundamental tenets is that a contractor cannot claim an equitable adjustment where it incurs additional costs or performance delays voluntarily, rather than as a result of government action.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g.,  Appeal of R-E, Inc., ASBCA No. 20891, 77-2 B.C.A. (CCH) P 12,670 (1977). In R-E, Inc., the contractor was to build a foundation for a utility pole installation in accordance with plans and specifications furnished by the government and had no obligation to pass upon the adequacy of such a foundation to accomplish the purpose in view. The contractor, nonetheless, insisted on installation of a more expensive foundation, allegedly on the basis that the government's foundation was not adequate. Held, that this was a design specification and not a performance specification; and that by prescribing the character and dimensions of the foundation, the government implicitly warranted that if the design was followed, the foundation would be adequate. Thus, the use of a steel-reinforced foundation, exceeding both the government's specifications and trade practice, did not entitle the contractor to additional compensation for the extra cost thus incurred.

See also  Calfon Constr., Inc. v. United States, 18 Cl. Ct. 426 (1989) , aff'd, 923 F.2d 872 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (listing elements to establish a constructive change);  Appeal of Essential Constr. Co., ASBCA No. 18706, 89-2 B.C.A. (CCH) P 21,632 (1989) (the board rejected contractor's claim because there was no support for the proposition that the government caused the delays);  Appeal of Berkeley Constr. Co., PSBCA No. 1153, 85-3 B.C.A. (CCH) P 18,254 (1985);  Appeal of Accent General, ASBCA No. 29796, 86-3 B.C.A. (CCH) P 19,237 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Another tenet is that a contractor cannot prevail on its claim for equitable adjustment unless it shows that its interpretation of the contract is reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Mortenson Co. v. United States, 843 F.2d 1360 (Fed. Cir. 1988) ;  P.J. Maffei Bldg. Wrecking Corp. v. United States, 732 F.2d 913 (Fed. Cir. 1984) ; Appeal of Moulder Bros., ASBCA Nos. 33389, 33714,  89-2 B.C.A. (CCH) P 21,639 (1989); Appeal of Santa Fe Eng'rs, Inc., ASBCA No. 32448, 89-3 B.C.A. (CCH) P 22,024 (1989). See also  T.L. James &amp; Co., Inc. v. Traylor Bros., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4378 (E.D. La. Mar. 23, 2000) (noting that the contractor must show that it reasonably relied upon its interpretation of the contract and that it incurred damage as a result of the material difference between the expected and actual conditions);  Johnny F. Smith Truck and Dragline Serv. v. United States, 49 Fed. Cl. 443 (2001) (if there is a conflict between the contractor's view of the government's obligations and the actual language of the contract provisions, this should trigger the contractor's duty to inquire; the contractor cannot protest the term unless the contractor inquired or sought clarification of the contract's language).&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the government is responsible only for changes ordered, approved, or adopted by the contracting officer or an authorized representative of the contracting officer.

==Causation==
To recover for a change, the contractor must show that the change caused the increased costs or delays for which it is seeking compensation.&lt;ref&gt;See  Massman Constr. Co. v. Tenn. Valley Auth., 769 F.2d 1114 (6th Cir. 1985) ;  Wunderlich Contracting Co. v. United States, 351 F.2d 956 (Ct. Cl. 1965) ;  Appeal of Batteast Constr. Co., Inc., ASBCA No. 35818, 92-1 B.C.A. (CCH) P 24,697 (1991) (based on on-site observations by project superintendent, the board ruled that the contractor was entitled to an adjustment for lost labor productivity attributable to government directed change); Appeal of Frontier Constr. Co., ASBCA No. 33658, 89-2 B.C.A. (CCH) P 21,595 (1989) (the board held that where the delay is the result of government fault, as with defective specifications, all of the delay is per se unreasonable).&lt;/ref&gt; A contractor ordinarily will not be entitled to recover for a constructive change in the work required by the government where the government's actions were not the direct cause of the contractor's increased costs. An example of such a situation is where government-furnished property is not at the work site on schedule, but does not cause any delay to the contractor because, for other reasons, the contractor was not ready to proceed with the installation of that property. Where, however, a contractor and the government are both responsible, through their unreasonable acts, for failure to discover a differing site condition, the costs of the delay have been ordered shared.&lt;ref&gt;T. Brown Constructors, Inc. v. Federico Pena, 132 F.3d 724 (Fed. Cir. 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6715">The '''Constitutional Council''' (French: ''Conseil constitutionnel'') is a judicial body in the [[government of Ivory Coast|government]] of [[Ivory Coast]] that is patterned after the [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council of France]]. The Council was created by law in 1994 and began its operations in 1995. The seat of the Council is in [[Abidjan]].

==Jurisdiction and powers==
The Constitutional Council exercises the following powers:
#determining the eligibility of candidates to run in [[President of Ivory Coast|presidential]] or [[National Assembly of Ivory Coast|legislative]] elections;
#certification and announcement of final election results;
#conducting referendums;
#determining the constitutionality of legislation and treaties.

Proposed legislation and treaties may be submitted by the government to the Council for a determination of constitutionality prior to the enactment of the law. They may also be submitted for scrutiny after they have been enacted.

If the constitutionality of a law is challenged in a judicial proceeding, the court may make a ruling on the issue and appeals on constitutionality issues are heard by the Constitutional Council. If a legal provision is declared to be unconstitutional, it cannot be enforced or applied.

No decision of the Constitutional Council may be appealed to any body. The Council is therefore the [[supreme court]] for matters within its jurisdiction.

==Composition==
The Constitutional Council may be composed of a President, two Vice-Presidents, former Presidents of Ivory Coast, and six councillors, or advisers. Decisions are made by majority vote. The President and Vice-Presidents serve six-year non-renewable terms and are appointed by the President of Ivory Coast. The six advisors are also appointed by the President of Ivory Coast to six-year non-renewable terms; three of the advisors are nominated by the President of Ivory Coast, and three are nominated by the President of the [[National Assembly of Ivory Coast|National Assembly]].

Former Presidents of Ivory Coast are entitled to lifetime membership on the Council. However, no former president has yet become a member of the Council.&lt;ref&gt;Ivory Coast has had only two presidents that have survived their presidency: [[Laurent Gbagbo]] and [[Henri Konan Bédié]]. Gbagbo is in custody of the [[International Criminal Court]], and Neither he nor Bédié have claimed their right to be on the Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Constitutional Council hold the rank of [[government minister|minister of the government]]. The President of the Constitutional Council administers the oath of office to the newly elected President of Ivory Coast.

==Role in 2010–11 crisis==
A decision of the Constitutional Council played a role in the [[2010–11 Ivorian crisis]]. In the [[Ivorian presidential election, 2010|Ivorian presidential election of 2010]], incumbent [[Laurent Gbagbo]] faced opposition leader [[Alassane Ouattara]]. On 2 December 2010, the Independent Electoral Commission released provisional results showing that Ouattara had won the election in the second round with 54 percent of the vote. However, the Constitutional Council refused to certify these results, and on 3 December, it declared that Gbangbo was the winner after taking just over 51 percent of the vote.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11913832|title=Ivory Coast poll overturned: Gbagbo declared winner|publisher=BBC news|date=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's decision was based on its refusal to certify the results from seven [[regions of Ivory Coast|regions]] in the north of the country, where it identified irregularities.&lt;ref name = bbc/&gt; Supporters of Ouattara argued that this was a pretext created by [[Paul Yao N'Dré]], the President of the Council and a Gbangbo loyalist.

As a result, both Gbagbo and Ouattara claimed victory and took the presidential [[oath of office]]. The ensuing events led [[Second Ivorian Civil War]], which resulted in the overthrow and arrest of Gbangbo and the installation of Ouattara as President in 2011. Ouattara's right to become president was affirmed by the Council after Ouattara and N'Dré met for negotiations.

After Ouattara became president, [[Francis Wodié]] was appointed to replace N'Dré as president of the Council.

{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2017}}
{{more citations needed|date=September 2017}}
Now repealed, '''Country of origin labeling''' (COOL) (or mCOOL [''m'' for mandatory]) was a requirement signed into American law under Title X of the [[Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002]] (also known as the 2002 Farm Bill), codified at {{USC|7|1638a}} as '''Notice of country of origin'''. This law had required retailers to provide [[Country of origin|country-of-origin]] labeling for fresh beef, pork, and lamb. The program exempted processed meats. The [[United States Congress]] passed an expansion of the COOL requirements on September 29, 2008, to include more food items such as fresh fruits, nuts and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/09/29/food.origin.labels.ap/|title=Associated Press|publisher=CNN News|accessdate=2008-09-30}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29717711/ ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulations were implemented on August 1, 2008 ({{USFR|73|45106}}), August 31, 2008 ({{USFR|73|50701}}), and May 24, 2013 ({{USFR|78|31367}}).

On December 18, 2015 Congress repealed the COOL law, as a part of the omnibus budget bill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2029/text|title = Found in Section 759 of US Bill 2029}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of a series of [[WTO]] rulings that prohibited labels based on country of origin.

== Background ==

"Under §304 of the [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act|Tariff Act of 1930]] as amended ({{usc|19|1304}}), every imported item must be conspicuously and indelibly marked in English to indicate to the "ultimate purchaser" its country of origin." According to the [[United States Customs Service|U.S. Customs]], generally defined the "ultimate purchaser" is the last U.S. person who will receive the goods in the form in which it was imported.

However, if the goods are destined for a U.S. based processor where they will undergo "substantial transformation", then that processor or manufacturer is considered the ultimate purchaser. The law authorizes exceptions to labeling requirements, such as for articles incapable of being marked or where the cost would be "economically prohibitive."

Exceptions to this are codified into law and known as the "[[J List]]", so named for §1304(a)(3)(J) of the statute, which empowered the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] to exempt classes of items that were "imported in substantial quantities during the five-year period immediately preceding January 1, 1937, and were not required during such period to be marked to indicate their origin."
 
This does not apply to food 'processed' in the US with ingredients from other countries. Processed food includes milk, juice, dry foods and dietary supplements/vitamins. A guidance document of the FDA states:&lt;ref name=FDACPG&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-afda-ice/documents/webcontent/ucm074567.pdf "CPG Sec. 560.200 Country of Origin Labeling"], Issued: 10/1/80, Revised: 6/30/89, 5/2005, Updated: 11/29/0]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# An imported product, such as shrimp, is peeled, deveined and incorporated into a shrimp dish, such as "shrimp quiche." The product is no longer identifiable as shrimp but as "quiche." The quiche is a product of the US. So labeling it as "product of the USA" would not be a violation of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|FFD&amp;C Act]]. (Whether or not it violates *[[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|CBP]]'s* requirements would need to be asked.) 
# An imported product, such as shrimp, is peeled and deveined. It is labeled as "Imported by" or "Distributed by" a firm in the USA. Such labeling would not violate the FFD&amp;C Act, but it would not meet the *CBP's* requirement for country of origin labeling. The product would also have to be clearly identified as to country of origin.

==Analysis==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}
The contrasting intents of these bills reflected the continuing divergence of opinion among lawmakers over whether a federally mandated labeling program is needed. Some contend that mandatory COOL will provide U.S. products with a competitive advantage over foreign products because US consumers, if offered a clear choice, prefer fresh foods of domestic origin, thereby strengthening demand and prices for them. Moreover, proponents argue that US consumers have a right to know the origin of their food, particularly at a time when US food imports are increasing, and whenever particular health and safety problems arise. They cite as one prominent example concerns about the safety of some foreign beef arising from the discoveries of [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE, or mad cow disease) in a number of Canadian-born cows (and two US cows) since 2003. Supporters of the COOL law argue that it is unfair to exempt meats and produce from the longstanding country labeling already required of almost all other imported consumer products, from automobiles to most other foods. They also note that many foreign countries already impose their own country-of-origin labeling.

Opponents of mandatory COOL counter that studies do not provide evidence that consumers want such labeling. They believe COOL is a thinly disguised trade barrier intended to increase importers' costs and to foster the unfounded perception that imports may be inherently less safe (or of lower quality) than US products. Food safety problems can as likely originate in domestic supplies as in imports, as evidenced by the more than 30 recalls of US meat and poultry products announced by USDA in 2006 alone, these opponents point out. Opponents argue that all food imports already must meet equivalent US safety standards, which are enforced by US officials at the border and overseas; scientific principles, not geography, must be the arbiter of safety. Industry implementation and record-keeping costs, estimated by USDA to be as high as $3.9&amp;nbsp;billion in the first year and $458&amp;nbsp;million per year after that, would far outweigh any economic benefits, critics add. (COOL proponents assert that these cost estimates were grossly exaggerated while some in industry claim they were too low).

== Canada kills COOL at the WTO ==
In 2009, the Canadian government launched a challenge to mCOOL at the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/media_commerce/comm/news-communiques/2009/350.aspx?view=d |title=WTO to Hear Canada's Challenge to U.S. Mandatory Country-of-Origin Labelling |publisher=[[Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development|Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada]] |date=November 19, 2009 |accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian federal government argued before the WTO that American "country of origin" labelling rules (COOL) actually worked to the detriment of the meat industry on both sides of the border by increasing costs, lowering processing efficiency and otherwise distorting trade across the Canada-U.S. border. Mexico made similar claims.

In 2011, Canada said the WTO ruled in Canada's favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/media_commerce/comm/news-communiques/2011/349.aspx?lang=eng&amp;view=d |title=Canada Wins World Trade Organization Case on U.S. Country-of-Origin Labelling |publisher=[[Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development|Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada]] |date=November 18, 2011 |accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US said the panel affirmed the right of the United States to require country of origin labeling for meat products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in Response to WTO Panel Decision on Country of Origin Labeling|date=November 2011|publisher=[[Office of the United States Trade Representative]]|url=http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2011/november/statement-office-us-trade-representative-response|accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada and Mexico asked the WTO for another review and permission to impose more than $2&amp;nbsp;billion a year in retaliatory tariffs, and the ruling was made public in summer 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meat Industry Loses Attempt to Block Country-of-Origin Labeling|date=March 28, 2014|work=[[Food Safety News]]|url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2014/03/meat-industry-fails-at-attempt-to-block-country-of-origin-labeling/|accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=May 2016}}

In May 2015, the WTO upheld its previous ruling that the U.S. COOL requirements discriminated against Canadian and Mexican livestock.&lt;ref name="WSJ: Retaliatory tariffs"/&gt; The two countries asked the WTO to authorize US$3&amp;nbsp;billion in retaliatory tariffs against U.S. imports.&lt;ref name="WSJ: Retaliatory tariffs"/&gt; In early December 2015, the WTO determined the impact of the COOL requirements on the Canadian and Mexican economies at $1.1&amp;nbsp;billion and authorized Canada and Mexico to impose $781&amp;nbsp;million and $228&amp;nbsp;million, respectively, in retaliatory tariffs against U.S. imports.&lt;ref name="WSJ: Retaliatory tariffs"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gee|first1=Kelsey|last2=Vieira|first2=Paul|title=WTO Says Canada, Mexico Can Slap $1 Billion in Tariffs on U.S. Over Meat Labels|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/wto-says-canada-mexico-can-slap-1-billion-in-tariffs-on-u-s-over-meat-labels-1449508424|accessdate=May 18, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=December 7, 2015|quote=Canada can slap about $781&amp;nbsp;million in tariffs on U.S. products and Mexico can apply about $228&amp;nbsp;million, the WTO ruled on Monday.

==COO marketing==
Some companies seek to communicate the COO and thereby to increase their customer's COO awareness with a number of different strategies:&lt;ref&gt;Aichner, T. 2014. Country-of-origin marketing: A list of typical strategies with examples. Journal of Brand Management, 21(1): 81–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legally regulated COO strategies:
* Use of the phrase "Made in..."
* Use of quality and origin labels

Unregulated COO strategies:
* COO embedded in the company name
* Typical COO words embedded in the company name
* Use of the COO language
* Use of famous or stereotypical people from the COO
* Use of COO flags and symbols
* Use of typical landscapes or famous buildings from the COO

{{cleanup|reason = after split-off from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill article, it still consists of an amount of repeated and out of the date information|date = January 2013}}
{{Deepwater Horizon oil spill series}}
The '''''Deepwater Horizon'' Oil Spill Trust''' is the $20 billion trust fund established by [[BP]] to settle claims arising from the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill]].  The fund was established to be used for natural resource damages, state and local response costs and individual compensation.&lt;ref name=upstream170610/&gt;  It was established as '''Gulf Coast Claims Facility''' (GCCF), announced on 16 June 2010 after meeting of BP executives with U.S. President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name=upstream170610/&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonell"/&gt;  In June 2012, the settlement of claims through the GCCF was replaced by the court supervised settlement program.&lt;ref name=ap100113/&gt;

==Background==
After the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill]] started, BP promised to compensate all those affected. Then CEO Tony Hayward stated, "We are taking full responsibility for the spill and we will clean it up and where people can present legitimate claims for damages we will honor them. We are going to be very, very aggressive in all of that."&lt;ref name="AutoBB-249"/&gt;  Prior to establishing the GCCF, emergency compensation was paid by BP from an initial facility.&lt;ref name=bdo/&gt;

==Gulf Coast Claims Facility==

===Establishment===
On 16 June, after meeting with President Obama, BP executives agreed to create a $20&amp;nbsp;billion spill response fund.&lt;ref name=upstream170610/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr160610"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"/&gt; BP said it would pay $3&amp;nbsp;billion in third quarter of 2010 and $2&amp;nbsp;billion in fourth quarter into the fund followed by a payment of $1.25&amp;nbsp;billion per quarter until it reaches $20&amp;nbsp;billion. In the interim, BP posted its US assets worth $20&amp;nbsp;billion as bond. The amount of the fund was not a cap on BP's liabilities. For the fund's payments, BP said it would cut its capital spending budget, sell $10&amp;nbsp;billion in assets, and drop its dividend.&lt;ref name=upstream170610/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-250"/&gt; After provisions of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Trust were released 11 August 2010, it was revealed that the BP Spill Fund may be backed by future drilling revenue, using BP's production as collateral.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-252"/&gt;  BP pledged as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] all [[royalties]] from the [[Thunder Horse Oil Field|Thunder Horse]], [[Atlantis Oil Field|Atlantis]], [[Mad Dog (oil platform)|Mad Dog]], Great White, [[Mars (oil platform)|Mars]], [[Ursa tension leg platform|Ursa]], and Na Kika fields in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref name=abc011010/&gt;

One aim of the fund was said to be  minimizing lawsuits against the company.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-251"/&gt; According to BP officials, the fund could be used for natural resource damages, state and local response costs and individual compensation but could not be used for fines or penalties.&lt;ref name=upstream170610/&gt;

===Operations===
The Gulf Coast Claims Facility began accepting claims on 23 August 2010. At the time it was handed over to Kenneth Feinberg, BP had already paid out $375 million.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-253"/&gt;  Almost 19,000 claims were submitted in the first week. Of those, roughly 1,200 claims were compensated, totaling about $6 million, the remaining applicants "lacked proper paperwork".&lt;ref name="AutoBB-257"/&gt; Feinberg pointed out that those closest to the spill area were the most likely to receive compensation. Claimants could receive between one and six months' compensation without waiving their right to sue; only those who file for and receive a lump-sum payment later in the year will waive their right to litigate.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-258"/&gt;

By November, BP said it had sent $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion in checks.&lt;ref name="newsobserver.com"/&gt; About 92,000 claimants had been paid or approved for payment {{as of|lc=on|2010|10|30}}. The claims facility declined to reveal the total amount requested by the nearly 315,000 people who have now filed. Denied claims rose dramatically in October; some 20,000 people had been told they have no right to emergency compensation, compared to about 125 denials at the end of September. Others say they are getting mere fractions of what they've lost, while still others received large checks and full payments.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-267"/&gt;

{{As of|2010|09|08}}, 50,000 claims, 44,000 of those for lost income, had been filed. Over 10,000 claims had been paid, totaling nearly $80 million.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-260"/&gt; By 17 September, about 15,000 claims remained unpaid. The claims were from individuals and businesses that had been fully documented and had already received loss payments from BP. Feinberg acknowledged that he had no excuse for the delay.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-261"/&gt; By early October, denied claims dropped from 528 to 116, as checks were cut and mailed to businesses that were initially told they would get no help. Along with those still waiting for money, dozens of people say they have received small fractions of the compensation they requested.&lt;ref name="businessweek.com"/&gt;  To July 2011, the fund has paid $4.7 billion to 198,475 claimants. The total number who have filed claims stands at 522,506, many with multiple claims. In all, the fund had nearly 1 million claims.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-275"/&gt;

Over its existence More than one million claims of 220,000 individual and business claimants were processed and more than $6.2 billion was paid out from the fund. 97% of payments were made to claimants in the [[States of the Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf States]].&lt;ref name=bdo/&gt;   During the transition period before the settlement of claims through the GCCF was replaced by the court supervised settlement program additional $404 million in claims were paid.&lt;ref name=ap100113/&gt;

===Feinberg's controversies===
Feinberg confirmed that BP is paying his salary, but questioned who else should pay it. Feinberg has been asked repeatedly to reveal his salary. In late July 2010, he stated that he would disclose the salary BP is paying him, after initially declining to do so.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-254"/&gt; In mid-August, he said that he would disclose the amount "probably next month" but insisted he is not beholden to BP.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-255"/&gt; However, in early October, he had not yet divulged the information as promised and when asked, declined to say how much he was compensated, only that it is a flat fee "totally unrelated" to the size of the fund and amounts paid.&lt;ref name="businessweek.com"/&gt; On 8 October 2010, it was revealed that Feinberg and his law firm have been paid more than $2.5 million from mid-June to 1 October.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-256"/&gt;

Feinberg stated, "If I haven't found you eligible, no court will find you eligible." [[Florida Attorney General]] [[Bill McCollum]] disputed Feinberg's statement in a letter.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-259"/&gt;  By late September 2010, Floridians and businesses criticized the claims process, claiming it has gotten worse under Feinberg's leadership, some saying the president and BP "should dump Feinberg if he doesn't get his act together soon".&lt;ref name="AutoBB-262"/&gt; The Obama Administration responded to criticism from Florida officials, including Gov. Charlie Crist and CFO Alex Sink, with a stern letter to Feinberg, saying the present pace of claims is "unacceptable" and directing his office to make whatever changes necessary to move things along. "The ''Deepwater Horizon'' Oil Spill has disrupted the lives of thousands upon thousands of individuals, often cutting off the income on which they depend. Many of these individuals and businesses simply do not have the resources to get by while they await processing by the GCCF" associate U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perrelli wrote.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-263"/&gt; One family in Louisiana has been waiting for a month on emergency funds from Feinberg's Gulf Coast Claims Fund, and says for them it is urgent. "Bills aren't paid, they take my car, they take my insurance, they take my house, and then I can't get him back and forth to dialysis," claims the wife of the former owner of "Lafourche Seafood".&lt;ref name="AutoBB-264"/&gt;

On 25 September, Feinberg responded to the complaints in a news release. "Over the past few weeks, I have heard from the people of the Gulf, elected officials, and others that payments remain too slow and not generous enough," Feinberg said. "I am implementing new procedures that will make this program more efficient, more accelerated and more generous." In less than five weeks, the dedicated $20 billion fund that BP set up has paid out over $400 million to more than 30,000 claimants. Funds allocated so far equal 2% of the total amount that BP agreed to set aside.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-265"/&gt; Feinberg has denied about 2,000 claims, another 20,000 applications were returned for more financial documentation, and about 15,000 more claims await review. Feinberg has said he's processing claims at a rate of 1,500 a day.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-266"/&gt;

In a letter sent 20 November by the Department of Justice (DOJ), Associate Attorney General Thomas Perrelli told Kenneth Feinberg that transparency is needed in the claims process so victims can see they're being treated fairly. The DOJ also expressed concerns about the pace of the pay-out process as the interim and final claims begin.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-268"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-269"/&gt;

Feinberg had said claimants would have to surrender their right to sue BP to receive payments beyond emergency disbursements. The deadline to apply for emergency payments expired 23 November. But after Gulf residents complained that the emergency payments were so small that they felt pushed into a hurried settlement to get more money, Feinberg made a concession. Under the new rules (beginning 24 November and lasting until 23 August 2013), businesses and individuals may request compensation once a quarter while they decide whether to permanently settle their claim. Still, the claims process has its critics. Alabama Rep. Jo Bonner asked the Justice Department to investigate the claims facility and to assume direct oversight of the process, saying he had no more trust in the new process than he had in the emergency-payment program. Feinberg had said he would hire his own adjusters, but according to Rep. Bonner, he is still using the same ones as when BP administered the fund. A spokeswoman for Feinberg said the hiring process of new adjusters was under way.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-270"/&gt;

According to BP's law firm, Feinberg's law firm received a total of $3.3 million from BP as of early November. The law firm was paid $850,000 a month since June 2010, and payment of this fee will continue until the end of the year; afterwards, the contract will be reviewed.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-271"/&gt;

In March 2011, Feinberg's law firm received an increase in the monthly wage from BP. Compensation rose from $850,000 to $1.25 million.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-272"/&gt;

In July 2011, Mississippi's attorney general  [[Jim Hood]] announced he is suing Feinberg to get access to claims filed by coastal residents, saying he's "seeking to make the process more transparent so people will know if Feinberg is looking out for the best interests of oil spill victims or BP". Hood has stated he believes Feinberg's operation is "intentionally delaying and denying legitimate claims".  Feinberg has been criticized by others about the amount and speed of payments as well as a lack of transparency.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-274"/&gt;

===Closure===
In July 2011, Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] announced that an independent audit will be performed on the GCCF.&lt;ref name="ksdk.com"/&gt;  The audit was approved by Senate on 21 October 2011.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-275"/&gt;  In December 2011 [[BDO Consulting]] was selected as the auditor.&lt;ref name=bdo/&gt;  In early 2012, auditor found that 7,300 claimants were wrongly denied or underpaid. As a result, about $64 million of additional payments were made.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-277"/&gt;  2,600 claimants were incorrectly rejected but "can't get their money now because their files didn't include information needed to calculate their proper payment amount".&lt;ref name="AutoBB-276"/&gt;

On 8 March 2012, after BP and a team of plaintiffs' attorneys agreed to a class-action settlement, a court-supervised administrator Patrick Juneau took over administration.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-277"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap250412/&gt; In June 2012, the settlement of claims through the GCCF was replaced by the court supervised settlement program.&lt;ref name=ap100113/&gt;

==Court supervised settlement program==
The court supervised settlement program began on 4 June 2012. It covers $9.6 billion of the total $20&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=rigzone300713/&gt;  It is administrated by the court appointed settlement administrator Patrick Juneau.&lt;ref name=ap100113/&gt;  Claims through the program will be accepted until April 2014.&lt;ref name=bloomberg220213/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MySettlementClaims.com|url=http://mysettlementclaims.com/questionaire.php?ids=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, BP sued Patrick Juneau over his interpretation of the settlement agreement conditions and damage claims arguing that Juneau has compensated certain business economic-loss claims which were not seen in the agreement.&lt;ref name=bloomberg160313/&gt;  In April 2013, BP requested to halt claims payouts from the fund due to a number of fraudulent damages.&lt;ref name=upstream190713/&gt;  According to BP, more than 7000&amp;nbsp;claims were "scams".&lt;ref name=upstream190713/&gt;  According to BP's CEO [[Bob Dudley]], disputed claims accounts more than a billion dollars.&lt;ref name=echo300713/&gt;  The request was rejected by the district judge of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana]] [[Carl Barbier]]. Barbier reasoned his decision saying that "BP has not produced any evidence that would warrant the court taking the drastic step of shutting down the entire claims program."&lt;ref name=upstream190713/&gt;

As of 30 June 2013, the total payments made from the fund amounted to $19.7&amp;nbsp;billion. After paying out remaining $300&amp;nbsp;million, the remaining claims will be compensated from the company's future profits.&lt;ref name=upstream300713/&gt;

The '''Drug Resistance Strategies Project''' (DRS), a program funded by the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] (NIDA), teaches [[adolescent]]s and pre-adolescents how to make decisions and resist [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], and other [[drug]]s (ATOD).

The DRS project was one of the first programs to examine how [[adolescents]] refused offers of substances. Adolescent narratives revealed for resistance strategies—Refuse, Explain, Avoid, and Leave that became known as the REAL strategies. These narratives became the basis for a multicultural school-based substance use [[Abuse prevention program|prevention program]], keepin’ it REAL (kiR). To reduce the likelihood that [[youth]] will engage in ATOD, the kiR lessons include personal stories and language that [[youth]] find familiar, along with teaching effective [[risk assessment]], decision making, [[communication]], and life skills including the REAL strategies. [[Middle School|Middle]] and [[elementary school]]s are currently implementing kiR in the following states: [[Arizona]], [[Delaware]], [[Indiana]], [[Maryland]], [[Michigan]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Tennessee]]. In 2006, the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]]'s National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices selected kiR as a “Model Program” for its culturally grounded substance use [[Abuse prevention program|prevention]] curriculum.

==History==
In the 1980s, Drs. Michelle Miller-Day and Michael Hecht’s research in interpersonal and interethnic communication at [[Arizona State University]] led them to use narrative and performance theories to study how people's personal stories promote [[reading (process)|reading]], prevent [[date rape]], and develop positive familial attitudes. They first obtained funding from NIDA and launched the Project (DRS1) in 1989. Initial research  was conducted in two [[high school]]s in [[Arizona]]. With this work, Miller-Day and Hecht identified the four resistance strategies (Refuse, Avoid, Explain, and Leave) that are the core of the DRS Project. Since then the project expanded to include [[middle school|middle]] and [[elementary school]] students and to address [[ethnicity]] and [[gender]].

In 1997, Hecht moved to the [[Pennsylvania State University]] where he continued the Drug Resistance Strategies Project in collaboration with colleagues from [[Arizona]]. The project developed, implemented, and evaluated a [[middle school]] [[Abuse prevention program|prevention]] curriculum. More specifically, Hecht and his colleagues created keepin’ it REAL and field tested the curriculum, which they later implemented in thirty five middle schools in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. KiR was successful in limiting use of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], and [[marijuana]] between 7th and 8th grades.

Starting in 2003, they have been working under a new [[Grant (money)|grant]] from the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]]. The current research concentrates on determining the best grade level to introduce the [[Abuse prevention program|prevention program]] (5th vs. 7th grade), including [[elementary school]] implementation in addition to [[middle school]]. In addition, work on DRS4 continues the long-term study examining the relationships among [[acculturation]], decision-making, different types of [[Informal social control|norms]], [[Identity (social science)|identity]], family structure, parent-child communication, and [[Recreational drug use|drug use]].

In 2012, Dr. Michelle Miller-Day moved to [[Chapman University]] where she continues to work closely with [[Pennsylvania State University]] on the Drug Resistance Strategies Project.

==Results==
The findings from this project are in numerous journals of [[health]], [[prevention science]], [[communication]], and [[social work]]. The publications contain all aspects covered by the project; some of them being the principle of [[culture|cultural]] grounding in school-based substance use prevention seen in the [[Journal of Language and Social Psychology]] and promoting reduced and discontinued substances among [[adolescent]] substance users, seen in the [[Prevention Science]]. Some of the work done on culture can be seen through the publication on [[ethnicity]] vs. [[ethnic identity]] in assessing what predicts substance use, norms, and [[behavior]]s, and a study of and acculturation status substance use prevention with [[Mexican people|Mexican]] and [[Mexican American]] youth, both seen in the [[Journal of Social Work Practice]] in the Addictions.

The use of [[tobacco]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and [[marijuana]] was compared using a self-reported [[quantity]] of frequency of use before the program and at two, eight, and fourteen months after students completed the [[curriculum]]. Participants in the program reported a lower use of the three substances than the students who did not receive the program. Effects lasted for up to 14 months for [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[marijuana]] use and up to 8 months for [[cigarette]]s. Other [[analysis]] show that the program works on [[adolescent]]s who have started using substances before keepin’ it REAL as well as those who have not.

Anti-substance attitudes were also found to be effected by the program.  At the 8 and 14-month follow-ups, the program participants reported lower expectations of positive consequences of substance use compared with students who did not receive the [[Abuse prevention program|intervention]]. Although the intervention had no effect on [[perception]]s of parental or [[Informal social control|peer norms]], students who received the program curriculum reported lower personal acceptance of [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] for up to eight months after the [[Abuse prevention program|intervention]]. When compared to the control students, students who received the [[Mexican American]] version of the curriculum reported smaller increases in estimates of the number of their friends who used drugs.

{{Politics of the European Union}}

The '''Commissioner for Competition''' is the member of the [[European Commission]] responsible for competition. The current commissioner is [[Margrethe Vestager]] ([[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|ALDE]]).

==Responsibilities==
The portfolio has responsibility for such matters as [[Competition regulator|commercial competition]], [[Mergers and acquisitions|company mergers]], [[cartel]]s, [[state aid]], and [[anti-trust]] law. The position became the sole merger authority for the [[European Economic Area]] in September 1990.

The Competition Commissioner is one of the most powerful positions in the Commission and is notable in affecting global companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Lungescu|first=Oana|publisher=BBC News |title =Examining the EU executive|date=23 July 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/3921303.stm|accessdate = 18 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, notably preventing the merge of two US companies, [[General Electric]] and [[Honeywell]], in 2001.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/01/939 The Commission prohibits GE's acquisition of Honeywell] europa.eu&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Neelie Kroes (then-Competition Commissioner) was the only Commissioner to make [[Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women]]; she held position 59.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/11/biz-07women_The-100-Most-Powerful-Women_Rank_3.html 100 Most Powerful Women] Forbes&lt;/ref&gt;

== Past commissioners ==
{{sect-stub|date=August 2017}}
=== Mario Monti (1999–2004) ===
[[File:Mario Monti.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Mario Monti]]
[[Mario Monti]] is particularly notable for his ruling during the [[Honeywell#GE-Honeywell merger attempt|GE-Honeywell merger attempt]] in 2001. [[General Electric]], a US company, sought to acquire another US company, [[Honeywell]]. This merger had been approved by US authorities, however Monti, with the backing of the rest of the Commission, rejected the merger;&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt;

{{cquote|The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines. However, there were ways of eliminating these concerns and allowing the merger to proceed. I regret that the companies were not able to agree on a solution that would have met the Commission's competition concerns.}}

Rather than be blocked from the European market, the merger was abandoned. This was the first time that a merger between two US companies had been blocked solely by European authorities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2001/07/03/europe/ge_eu/ Honeywell CEO's job reported on line after takeover is rejected] money.cnn.com&lt;/ref&gt; only the second time it had blocked just two US companies and only the 15th merger it had blocked ever since it started work.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt; On 1 May 2004 Monti oversaw a radical change in the Competition powers of the Commission concerning anti-trust regulation, merger controls, licensing agreements and air transport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/publications/special/interview_monti.pdf The EU gets new competition powers for the 21st century] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228033025/http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/publications/special/interview_monti.pdf |date=28 February 2008 }} ec.europa.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neelie Kroes (2004–2010) ===
During [[Neelie Kroes]]' hearing at the [[European Parliament]], [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s expressed concern about whether Ms Kroes had a sufficiently detailed grasp of certain specific subjects, but was approved as part of the Commission in 2004.

Since then she states that she promotes a fair and free business environment, achieving sustainable economic growth and higher employment. The Commission has been involved in a number of high-profile cases fighting anticompetitive behaviour; such as the case against the merger of [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]] – [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], against [[Apple Inc.]] regarding [[iTunes]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,475398,00.html Brussels Accuses iTunes of Violating Competition Rules] spiegel.de&lt;/ref&gt; and the ongoing [[European Union v. Microsoft|case against Microsoft]].

[[File:Neelie kroes.jpg|thumb|Neelie Kroes]]

The latter has been an ongoing dispute on a number of issues, in April 2007 Microsoft became the first company to refuse to comply with the Commissions rulings, in response Commissioner Kroes is looking at more harsher methods to gain the co-operation of companies; "We have never, ever before encountered a company that has refused to comply with commission decisions ... We learned we may have to look for a more effective remedy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003675344_microsofteu21.html?syndication=rss Microsoft dispute a lesson, EU says] seattletimes.nwsource.com&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, the [[Court of First Instance]] (EU's second highest court) upheld the Commission's decision to fine Microsoft 497&amp;nbsp;million euro and its order for to Microsoft for it to share its information setting what the Commission described as an "important precedent". Kroes stated that "Today's court ruling…shows that the Commission was right to take its decision, and right to take firm action to enforce that decision". Either party may appeal to the [[European Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/9/24771 Microsoft case sets precedent, says Brussels] EU observer&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the ruling the US Justice Departments top antitrust official, Thomas Barnett, criticised the ruling which sparked a response from Kroes stating that "It is totally unacceptable that a representative of the US administration criticises an independent court of law outside its jurisdiction ... It is absolutely not on. The European Commission does not pass judgement on rulings by US courts and we expect the same degree of respect from US authorities for rulings by EU courts."&lt;ref&gt;Spongenberg, Helena (20 September 2007) [http://euobserver.com/9/24803 US remarks on Microsoft ruling 'unacceptable', says Kroes], EU Observer&lt;/ref&gt;

Kroes holds a strong belief in free market principles and was tough with offenders. By the time her term as Competition Commissioner ended, she had completed most major cases.&lt;ref name="FT Who"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c980127c-d841-11de-8b04-00144feabdc0.html Who’s who in the new Commission], Financial Times November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Joaquín Almunia (2010–2014) ===
[[Joaquín Almunia]], previously the [[European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs|Finance Commissioner]], took on the competition portfolio under the second [[Barroso Commission]] in 2010 and was expected to have a tenure similar to Kroes' stringent run.&lt;ref name="FT Who"/&gt; His appointment was welcomed by competition lawyers as someone well qualified and experienced.&lt;ref name="FT Who"/&gt; He also impressed Parliament at his hearing and early on in his work has had to deal with whether or not to pursue action against [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/bfa5fb66-2177-11df-830e-00144feab49a.html Accusations will test new commissioner], ''Financial Times''&lt;/ref&gt; He has also come out in favour of the idea of a [[Eurozone|European Monetary Fund]] to deal with defaulting member states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-15/eu-s-almunia-says-emf-would-be-a-long-term-solution-update1-.html EU’s Almunia Says EMF Would Be a Long-Term Solution (Update1)] Business Week&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2523">The '''Hungarian National Council''' ({{lang-hu|Magyar Nemzeti Tanács}}) was an institution from the time of transition from the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (part of [[Austria-Hungary]]) to the [[Hungarian Democratic Republic|People's Republic]] in 1918. At the congress of the [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party]] (MSZDP) in October 1918 called for the Socialist Left [[József Pogány]] minority to its own policy, which should be based on the emerging workers 'and soldiers' councils. In contrast prevailed [[Zsigmond Kunfi]] in the MSZDP that the [[Left-libertarianism|liberal left]] "48" party of Count [[Mihály Károlyi]] and the bourgeois radical party of [[Oszkár Jászi]] was entered into an alliance. These three parties formed on 25 October, the Hungarian National Council (see also [[Aster Revolution]]).

The National Council called for a 12-point program, especially the immediate termination of the [[World War I|war]], the [[sovereignty|Independence]] from [[Vienna]], the recognition of minority rights in the "[[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen]]" a comprehensive agrarian reform, assembly, association and freedom of expression and universal, equal, and that the [[Women's Suffrage|Women's full suffrage]].

Emperor and King [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]] (IV) dismissed the previous prime minister, [[Sándor Wekerle]] in late October and temporarily appointed Count [[János Hadik]] to finally the ''red Count'' Mihály Károlyi to appoint as premier. On 16 November 1918 were the deputies of the Hungarian Parliament, which dated from before the war, the supreme power in the Károlyi government, which then proclaimed the [[Hungarian Democratic Republic]].

It was replaced by the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] led by [[Béla Kun]], from 21 March to 6 August 1919 had stock, and on 1 March 1920, the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was re-established, that under [[Miklós Horthy]].

In some countries and cases, a person who has been [[asylum seeker]] but has received negative decision, may still be entitled to reside in the country where the person has applied for a [[residence permit]] due to such impediments, and may get a temporary or permanent residence permit. In other countries and cases, the person would be considered an [[undocumented immigration|undocumented]] (also known as illegal or irregular) immigrant, or may be in an undefined legal state. 

Examples of impediments to expulsion in certain countries are:
* The home country refuses to receive the person.
* The  foreigner's identity was not established. 
* Transport is not possible.
* Serious difficulties would arise due to the foreigner's health condition 
* New [[Right of asylum|asylum reasons]] occur after the deportation decision, with reference to the principle of [[non-refoulement]] in the international [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|Refugee Convention]]. The [[European Court of Human Rights]], referring to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], has shown in a number of indicative judgments that there are enforcement barriers to expulsion to certain countries, for example due to the risk of torture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{"fulltext":["impediment to expulsion"],"kpthesaurus":["350"]} Search results on "Impediment to expulsion" in the European Court of Human Rights archive&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Criminal Court Moot Court Competition''' or '''ICCMCC''' is an annual international [[moot court]] competition on [[international criminal law]] that is held at [[The Hague]] and organised by the Grotius Centre for International Legal Studies of [[Leiden University]], The Hague Campus, with the institutional support of the [[International Criminal Court]]. The first edition of the competition was in 2005, but it only became an international competition in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://iccmoot.com/organization/&lt;/ref&gt; With more than a hundred teams from 50 countries taking part annually, the ICCMCC is the world's largest competition on international criminal law and is considered one of the grand slam or major moots.&lt;ref&gt;https://lawgazette.com.sg/news/events/another-season-record-breaking-international-moot-court-achievements-smu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.legallyindia.com/the-bench-and-the-bar/mooting-premier-league-is-back-mpl-7-sees-nliu-nalsar-uils-nls-lead-after-strong-start-in-2016-00011130-8208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sja.nujs.edu/newsroom/2018/06/01/nujs-emerges-runner-up-the-icc-moot-court-competition-2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/smu-team-wins-moot-contest-in-the-hague&lt;/ref&gt;

Judges of the competition include ICC judges and officers, and teams have to present arguments based on a fictitious problem via the roles of prosecution counsel, defence counsel, government counsel, or victim's representative. The arguments made usually relate to pre-trial or appeal proceedings. Each team is given 20 minutes for the main submissions and 10 minutes for rebuttal/surebuttal. For the English edition of the moot, each country can only send two to three teams to participate; where necessary, regional rounds are organised to select the teams that will compete in the international rounds. As of 2017/18, regional rounds have been held for the Americas and Caribbean, Brazil, China, Germany, India, and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;http://iccmoot.com/winners-regionalnational-rounds-2018/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, semi-final rounds were introduced for the top nine teams, with the top three teams proceeding to the championship final. In 2015, the number of preliminary rounds were increased from three to six, and in 2016 quarter-final rounds were introduced for the top 27 teams.

[[Singapore Management University School of Law|Singapore Management University]], which debuted in 2015, has the best track record in this competition, having reached the international championship final four times and winning it thrice.

==About==
Founded in 1971 and formally incorporated as a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] association in 1973, the International Technology Law Association (ITechLaw) is a worldwide organization representing [[lawyers]] and other professionals in the technology sector. The organization’s global membership spans six continents and embodies a broad spectrum of expertise.

In addition to serving as a forum for members to discuss a wide range of legal issues, the association regularly organizes conferences that explore cutting-edge issues and trends in both [[information technology]] and [[intellectual property law]]. ITechLaw is a non-profit organization partly supported by annual membership dues.

== History ==
ITechLaw was founded as the Computer Law Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itechlaw.org/about.htm About ITechLaw]&lt;/ref&gt;  ITechLaw assumed its current name in 2006 to reflect its international membership and the convergence of computing technologies with other technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itechlaw.org/itechlaw_pressrelease_jan_26_2006.pdf Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, ITechLaw opened its membership beyond legal professionals to other professionals with an interest in technology law issues.  A detailed history of the association can be found at the ITechLaw Web site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itechlaw.org/history_project.htm ITechLaw History Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

ITechLaw’s activities include hosting national and international conferences, workshops known as CyberspaceCamp and Webinars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itechlaw.org/conferences.htm ITechLaw Conference Details]&lt;/ref&gt; The organization typically holds three conferences each year to accommodate attendance by members worldwide.  In recent years, ITechLaw has held annual meetings in North America, Europe and Asia. Conferences are open to members and non-members.

ITechLaw also organizes periodic [[Webinar]]s to discuss issues of interest to its membership. Recent Webinars have discussed topics including [[data security]], the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act|Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)]], the [[Communications Decency Act|Communications Decency Act (CDA)]] and the [[Gpl#Version_3|GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3]].  Attendance of Webinars is open to members and non-members.

== Publications ==
ITechLaw publishes a quarterly journal, the ''eBulletin'', which discusses technology-related legal issues and recent [[court]] cases of interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itechlaw.org/publications.htm ITechLaw Publications]&lt;/ref&gt;   The ''eBulletin'' includes scholarly articles on timely issues relevant to technology lawyers, analyses of recent case law and with news and updates on the ITechLaw organization. An online archive is provided for members.

ITechLaw also publishes ''eNews'', a monthly newsfeed about its members through which members also receive daily notices regarding updates about IT law.

'''[[Sexual violence]]''' includes, but is not limited to [[rape]]. Although there is no agreed upon definition of sexual violence, commonly applied ones encompass any act of a sexual nature or attempt to obtain a sexual act carried out through coercion. Sexual violence also includes physical and psychological violence directed at a person's sexuality, including unwanted comments or advances, or acts of traffic such as forced [[prostitution]] or [[sexual slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;[WHO (2002), 'Sexual violence', in World Report in violence and health, Chapter 6, pp. 149]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Elements of Crimes, Article 7(1)(g)-6 Crimes against humanity of sexual violence, elements 1.

Sexual violence, in times of peace and armed conflict situations, is widespread and considered to be one of the most traumatic, pervasive, and most common violations human beings suffer.&lt;ref name="Lindsey2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindsey|first=Charlotte|title=Women facing war|year=2001|publisher=ICRC|location=Geneva|pages=57–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icrc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Advancement of women: ICRC statement to the United Nations, 2013|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/statement/2013/united-nations-women-statement-2013-10-16.htm|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a serious public health and human rights problem and has profound short- and long- term impacts on physical and mental health. Though women and girls suffer disproportionately from this kind of violence, it can occur to anybody at any age. It is also an act of violence that can be perpetrated by parents, caregivers, acquaintances, and strangers, as well as intimate partners. Sexual violence is rarely a crime of passion; it is an aggressive act that frequently aims to express power and dominance over the victim.

Sexual violence remains highly stigmatized in all settings; thus, levels of disclosure of the assault vary between regions. In general, it is widely under-reported; thus, available data tend to underestimate the true scale of the problem. In addition, sexual violence is also a neglected area of research; thus, deeper understanding of the issue is needed to promote a coordinated movement against it. It is important to distinguish between domestic sexual violence and conflict-related sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;[Human Security Report (2012), Sexual Violence, Education and War: Beyond the mainstream narrative, Human Security Research Group, Simon Fraser University, Canada, Human Security Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Often, people who coerce their spouses into sexual acts believe their actions are legitimate because they are married. In times of conflict, sexual violence tends to be an inevitable repercussion of warfare trapped in an ongoing cycle of impunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=International Committee of the Red Cross|title=Women and War|year=2008|publisher=ICRC|location=Geneva|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|title=The shame of war: sexual violence against women and girls in conflict|year=2007|publisher=OCHA/IRIN Publication|pages=57–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rape is often used as a weapon of war, as a form of attack on the enemy, typifying the conquest and degradation of its women or men or captured fighters of any gender.&lt;ref&gt;Swiss S et al. Violence against women during the Liberian civil conflict. Journal of the American Medical Association, 1998, 279:625–629.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though [[international humanitarian law]] (IHL) strongly prohibits sexual violence in all armed conflicts and [[international human rights law]] (IHRL) and [[international customary law]] strongly prohibit it at all times, enforcement mechanisms are fragile or do not exist in many parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Lindsey2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="icrc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Physicians2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Physicians for Human Rights|title=War-related sexual violence in Sierra Leone : a population-based assessment : a report|year=2002|publisher=Physicians for Human Rights|location=Boston, MA|isbn=1-879707-37-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="United2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|title=The shame of war: sexual violence against women and girls in conflict|year=2007|publisher=OCHA/IRIN Publication}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acts of sexual violence can be charged as a [[crime against humanity]], [[genocide]], [[war crime]], or grave breach of the [[Geneva Conventions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bassiouni|first=M.

References to sexual offences and violence provided in IHL instruments are only partially expressed in the [[1949 Geneva Conventions]], and even more vaguely considered in the 1977 Additional Protocols.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/additional-protocols-1977.htm%20 1977 Additional Protocols].

The first time the [[Security Council]] addressed the impacts of armed conflict on women was in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325|Resolution 1325 (2000)]]. The document focuses on the need for specific protections for women and girls in conflict and expresses the need to consider gender perspectives in mission, UN peace support operations, and post-conflict processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peace Women.

[[Resolution 1820|Resolution 1820 (2008)]] of the [[UN Security Council]] declares that [[rape]] and other forms of sexual violence "can constitute [[war crimes]], [[crimes against humanity]] or a constitutive act with respect to [[genocide]]".

[[File:Zainab Bangura giving a radio interview in Kinshasa (8654821769).jpg|thumb|Zainab Bangura, the United Nations Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict since September 2012]]
[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888|Resolution 1888 (2009)]] is perceived as an advancement in international law as it created the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Sexual Violence in Conflict (SRSG-SVC).&lt;ref name="un" /&gt; The first Special Representative, [[Margot Wallström]], was appointed in April 2010. The current Special Representative [[Zainab Hawa Bangura]] took office in September 2012. The Office identified eight priority countries: [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]; [[Central African Republic]] (CAR); [[Colombia]]; [[Cote d’Ivoire]]; [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC); [[Liberia]]; [[South Sudan]] and [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name="un"&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Sexual Violence in Conflict|url=https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/about-us/about-the-office/|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; SRSG-SVC is also engaged in the Middle East ([[Syria]]) and in Asia and the Pacific ([[Cambodia]]).&lt;ref name="un" /&gt;

The six priorities of the Office are:

'''''Justice K. S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs Union Of India And Ors''' .''is a landmark judgment of the [[Supreme Court of India]], which holds that the right to privacy is protected as a fundamental constitutional right under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the [[Constitution of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhandari|first=Vrinda|last2=Kak|first2=Amba|last3=Parsheera|first3=Smriti|last4=Rahman|first4=Faiza|date=|title=An Analysis of Puttaswamy: The Supreme Court's Privacy Verdict|url=http://www.indrastra.com/2017/11/An-Analysis-of-Puttaswamy-Supreme-Court-s-Privacy-Verdict-003-11-2017-0004.html|journal=IndraStra Global|volume=003|pages=004|issn=2381-3652|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judgement of the nine-judge [[Constitution bench (India)|constitution bench]] contains six concurring opinions affirming the right to privacy of Indian citizens. It explicitly overrules previous judgements of the Supreme Court in ''Kharak Singh vs. State of UP'' and ''M.P Sharma v Union of India'', which had held that there is no fundamental right to privacy under the Indian Constitution.

The judgment was interpreted as paving the way for the eventual decriminalisation of homosexuality in India in ''[[Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India]]'' (2018).

{{ElectionsME}}
'''Maine Question 5''', formally '''An Act to Establish Ranked-Choice Voting''',&lt;ref&gt;https://www1.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/citizensguide2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a citizen-initiated referendum question that qualified for the [[Maine]] November 8, 2016 statewide ballot and was approved by a margin of 52% to 48%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/maine-ballot-measure-5-allow-ranked-choice-voting |title=Maine Question 5 — Allow Ranked-Choice Voting — Results: Approved – Election Results 2016 |publisher=New York Times |date=2017-08-01 |accessdate=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would change how most Maine elections will be conducted from a [[plurality voting system]] to a [[Instant-runoff voting|ranked choice voting]] system (RCV, also known as instant runoff voting). It appeared on the ballot along with elections for [[United States presidential election, 2016|President of the United States]], [[United States House of Representatives elections in Maine, 2016|Maine's two U.S. House seats]], the Legislature, [[Maine referendums, 2016|five other ballot questions]], and various local elections. Maine would be the first state to use such a system for its statewide elections for governor and U.S. Senate if implemented.

An [[advisory opinion]] by the [[Maine Supreme Judicial Court]], issued on May 23, 2017, stated that the Court would rule ranked choice voting unconstitutional if it came before them, with respect to elections for state offices.  This led the [[Maine Legislature]] to vote to delay its implementation until 2021 to allow time for a Constitutional amendment to be passed to permit it.  Supporters gathered signatures to force a successful [[people's veto]] [[Maine Question 1, June 2018|referendum]] on the matter in order to prevent the delay.

==Background==
In the 11 Maine gubernatorial elections prior to 2016, only incumbent Governors [[Joseph E. Brennan|Joe Brennan]] in [[Maine gubernatorial election, 1982|1982]] and [[Angus King]] in [[Maine gubernatorial election, 1998|1998]] won more than 50% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2015/10/12/politics/maine-group-launching-campaign-for-ranked-choice-voting/?ref=relatedBox|title=Maine group launching campaign for ranked-choice voting|publisher=Bangor Daily News/Lewiston SunJournal |date=October 12, 2015 |accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically gubernatorial elections have more than two candidates; the [[Maine gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 election]] had five candidates, with [[Paul LePage]] emerging as the winner with 37.6% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/results/2010-11/gen2010gov.html|title=2010 Governor General Election Tabulations|publisher=Office of the Maine Secretary of State |accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some public opinion felt that his victory was due to opponents of LePage dividing their votes between Democratic candidate [[Libby Mitchell]] and independent candidate [[Eliot Cutler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2014/10/27/politics/elections/maine-lawmakers-seek-to-end-strategic-voting-spoilers-with-petition-for-ranked-choice-voting/?ref=relatedBox|title=Maine lawmakers seek to end strategic voting, ‘spoilers’ with petition for ranked-choice voting|publisher=Bangor Daily News |date=October 27, 2015 |accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals to enact ranked choice voting have been introduced in the Legislature as early as 2003, but were rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.bangordailynews.com/2003/02/20/bill-seeks-to-assure-majority-vote-wins|title=Bill seeks to assure majority vote wins|publisher=Bangor Daily News |date=February 20, 2003 |accessdate=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2011/03/14/opinion/a-better-way-to-vote-2/?ref=relatedBox|title=A Better Way to Vote|publisher=Bangor Daily News |date=March 14, 2011 |accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a 2010 charter change, the city of [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] began electing its mayor using ranked choice voting in [[Portland, Maine mayoral election, 2011|2011]]. There were new legislative proposals in 2011, though they were rejected as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2013/05/06/politics/state-house/bill-to-create-maine-presidential-primary-adopt-ranked-choice-voting-comes-with-hefty-price-tag/?ref=relatedBox|title=Bill to create Maine presidential primary, adopt ranked-choice voting comes with hefty price tag|publisher=Bangor Daily News |date=May 6, 2013 |accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, upon releasing his supporters to vote for someone else in the [[Maine gubernatorial election, 2014|2014 election]], Eliot Cutler encouraged his supporters to support ranked choice voting.&lt;ref name=cutler&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2014/10/29/politics/cutler-to-make-election-announcement-at-impromptu-news-conference-wednesday-morning/|title=Cutler says victory is ‘long shot,’ tells supporters to vote accordingly|publisher=Bangor Daily News |date=October 29, 2014 |accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Led by former independent [[Maine Senate|State Senator]] [[Richard Woodbury|Dick Woodbury]], Ranked Choice Voting collected more than the 61,123 valid signatures necessary to put a proposal to voters, collecting some 40,000 on Election Day 2014. The group collected 75,369 signatures and delivered them to [[Maine Secretary of State]] [[Matthew Dunlap]] by October 19, 2015. Dunlap ultimately certified 64,687 signatures by November 18, 2015, which put the proposal on the November 2016 ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/sos/news/2015/rankedchoiceinitiative.html|title=Citizens’ initiative for ranked-choice voting found valid with 64,687 signatures|publisher=Office of the Maine Secretary of State |date=November 18, 2015 |accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per the Maine Constitution, the proposal went to the Legislature in its 2016 session, but it did not act on the measure. On January 20, 2016, the [[Maine House of Representatives]] voted to place the proposal on the ballot without holding a public hearing, over the objections of Republicans, led by Rep. Heather Sirocki, expressing concern about the constitutionality of the proposal.&lt;ref name=constitution /&gt; Secretary of State Dunlap released the final wording of the question on June 23 as it will appear on the ballot: "Do you want to allow voters to rank their choices of candidates in elections for U.S. Senate, Congress, Governor, State Senate, and State Representative, and to have ballots counted at the state level in multiple rounds in which last-place candidates are eliminated until a candidate wins by majority?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stateandcapitol.bangordailynews.com/2016/06/23/maine-secretary-of-state-revises-wording-of-all-five-november-ballot-questions/|title=Maine secretary of state revises wording of all five November ballot questions|publisher=Bangor Daily News |date=June 23, 2016 |accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutionality===
Some, including a Deputy Secretary of State and a state legislator, expressed concern about the constitutionality of the proposal. Deputy Secretary of State Julie Flynn said that the Maine Constitution requires that the Governor and state legislators be elected with a plurality of votes and that a system based on ranked choice voting could be challenged in court. (The state constitution was amended in 1847, 1875, and 1880 to choose winners by [[Plurality voting|plurality]] for House, Senate, and Governor, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rcvmaine.com/history|title=Maine's History of Majority Rule and the Adoption of Plurality Provisions|work=The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, an election with no [[majority]] winner would be decided by multiple election rounds or by the state legislature.)  

Flynn also expressed concern that the proposal inserts the Secretary of State into the process, while the Constitution states that votes shall be tabulated by municipal officials.&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centralmaine.com/2016/01/20/maine-election-official-lawmakers-question-legality-of-ranked-choice-voting-proposal/|title=Maine officials, legislators question legality of ranked-choice voting|publisher=Kennebec Journal |date=January 21, 2016 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maine Attorney General]] [[Janet T. Mills|Janet Mills]] issued an opinion at the request of [[Maine Senate]] President [[Michael Thibodeau]] stating that while the referendum must appear on the ballot, it will likely require amending the Maine Constitution to implement it, in order to satisfy the concerns given by the Secretary of State's office. 

She added that the manner in which the proposal addresses how a tie in the voting should be addressed, drawing lots, directly conflicted with Article V of the Maine Constitution, which states that a tie in the vote for Governor would be settled by the Maine Legislature meeting in joint session to choose a winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2016/03/05/maine-attorney-general-says-ranked-choice-voting-may-require-amending-constitution/|title=Maine attorney general says ranked-choice voting may require amending constitution|publisher=Portland Press Herald |date=March 5, 2016 |accessdate=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting Maine dismissed such concerns, noting that a majority vote is always a plurality vote and that such a system has survived legal challenges in several other states. Its website statement also linked to statements by several Maine law professors supporting its arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcvmaine.com/does_ranked_choice_voting_raise_any_constitutional_questions|title=Does ranked choice voting raise any constitutional questions?|publisher=Committee for Ranked Choice Voting|accessdate=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the question was approved by voters, the Maine Senate submitted questions to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, which issued an advisory opinion on May 23, 2017. They unanimously ruled that ranked choice voting was unconstitutional in state, but not federal, general elections. In response, the legislature passed a law on November 4, 2017 that amended the ranked-choice voting law to apply only to primary elections for Congress, Governor, State Senator, and State Representative; and for general elections for Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ranked Choice Voting in Maine |url=http://legislature.maine.gov/lawlibrary/ranked-choice-voting-in-maine/9509 |accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
Supporters of the proposal, led by Ranked Choice Voting Maine, contend that it will lead to people voting for the candidate that they support and end strategic voting to vote merely for the candidate that they think will win, and that the ranked choice system will result in a candidate that has some level of support from a majority of voters. They further contend that ranked choice voting will result in less negative campaigning, as candidates will need to appeal to a broad coalition of voters beyond their base of supporters to gain support as a second or third choice, if needed.

==Maine Supreme Court ruling==
On February 3, 2017, the [[Maine Senate]] voted 24-10 to ask the [[Maine Supreme Judicial Court]] for an [[advisory opinion]] as to the constitutionality of the approved proposal, after concerns about its constitutionality were expressed by [[Maine Attorney General]] [[Janet T. Mills|Janet Mills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mainepublic.org/post/maine-senate-asks-high-court-opinion-voter-approved-ranked-choice-initiative#stream/0|title=Maine Senate Asks High Court for Opinion on Voter-Approved Ranked-Choice Initiative |publisher=[[MPBN]]|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2017, the Court issued its opinion that the law would be unconstitutional if it came before them, stating it would violate the provision of the Maine Constitution requiring elections to be decided by a plurality of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3728801-Maine-Supreme-Judicial-Court-ruling-on-Ranked.html |title=Opinion of the Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court |date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; State legislators had mixed reactions to the ruling, with Senate President [[Michael Thibodeau]] calling for the law to be repealed and Democratic State Sen. Catherine Breen stating she would propose a Constitutional amendment to permit the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2017/05/23/politics/maine-supreme-judicial-court-rules-ranked-choice-voting-unconstitutional/|title=Maine Supreme Judicial Court rules ranked-choice voting unconstitutional|last=|first=|date=May 23, 2017|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|accessdate=May 23, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislature’s Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee on June 8 reported out to the floor five bills in reaction to the ruling, including one that would implement ranked choice voting in 2018 for uses unaffected by the Court's opinion - that is, congressional elections and primaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ranked-choice voting bills go to full Legislature for debate|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2017/06/08/rank-choiced-voting-bills-head-to-full-legislature-for-debate/|accessdate=June 9, 2017|newspaper=Portland Press Herald|date=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 23, 2017, the Legislature voted to delay implementation of the RCV law for all races until 2021, to allow for time to pass a state constitutional amendment to allow it. This repeal affects even those races not affected by the Court’s opinion, with the argument that Maine voters would be confused by a mix of RCV and non-RCV choices on a ballot. However, if such an amendment is not passed, the law would be repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcsh6.com/news/politics/loose-ends-bring-legislature-back-for-special-session/485282422 |title=Ranked choice voting delayed until 2021 |publisher=WCSH6.com |date=2017-10-23 |accessdate=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's veto===
{{also|Maine Question 1, June 2018}}

Supporters, angered by the delay, launched a [[people's veto]] signature-gathering effort to prevent it, pointing to its successful use in mixed-race ballots in Portland.  The veto passed as [[Maine Question 1, June 2018]], restoring ranked-choice voting for primary and federal elections.

Monack began as a tagger targeting the [[South Side (Pittsburgh)|South Side]] and [[Shadyside (Pittsburgh)|Shadyside]] neighborhoods, but after his tags were abated, he began placing his tags in hard to reach places, including tall bridges and highway overpasses.&lt;ref name=mcnulty&gt;{{cite news | last =McNulty | first =Timothy | title = Police anger reaches new heights over Mook's daredevil graffiti  | newspaper =[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date =October 5, 2001 | url =http://old.post-gazette.com/regionstate/20011005graffiti1005p3.asp | archiveurl= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iOhRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fnADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1587%2C1492297 | archivedate=October 5, 2001| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He drew the ire of the then-[[Pittsburgh Mayor]] [[Thomas J.

He tagged "So you want to get tough?" on the [[Birmingham Bridge]].&lt;ref name=mcnulty /&gt; in response.

He became known around the community for vandalizing previously unheard of places.&lt;ref name=mcnulty /&gt;  According to Pittsburgh officials, "He's going into areas no one's gone before."&lt;ref name=mcnulty /&gt; He became known among law enforcement across [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =White | first =Bill | title =Graffiti punks in high places spur curiosity | newspaper =[[The Morning Call]] | date =Aug 7, 2004 | url =https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/mcall/doc/393118774.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the media coverage of Monack's "Mook" tagging in the Pittsburgh area, it is possible that multiple copycats have applied graffiti using the moniker "Mook".&lt;ref name=mcnulty /&gt;

[[Oregon Department of Transportation]] and the [[Portland Police Bureau]] began investigating after graffiti appeared on two sets of brand new electronic signs hanging over I-84 freeway in [[Portland, Oregon]] before they have even been commissioned.

On September 13th, 2018, a Portland man Marcus E Gunther was arrested and charged with a felony criminal mischief and three counts of misdemeanor criminal mischief.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8628">The '''Nakdi Report''', also known as the '''Nakdi Document''' ({{lang-he|מסמך נקדי}}, ''{{lang|he-Latn|Mismach Nakdi}}'' )  or as the '''Nakdi guidelines''' is the document that provides ethical guidelines for use in Israel's broadcasting industry. Published as the '''''Guidelines for Coverage of News and Current Affairs''''' in 1995, the doctrine was first introduced in 1972 by the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]]. It is named for its original author, [[Nakdimon Rogel]].&lt;ref name=jp&gt;{{cite news|first=Greer Fay|last=Cashman |title=Veteran journalist and broadcaster Nakdimon Rogel dies |url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=248645&amp;R=R101|work=[[Jerusalem Post]] |publisher= |date=2011-12-08 |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patterned after the [[BBC]]’s Editorial Guidelines (previously, the Producer Guidelines), the Document currently consists of 161 clauses and contains a comprehensive code of ethics and practice for journalists working within the IBA. It is also applied to journalists in private broadcasting, though it is not legally binding.&lt;ref&gt;[[Second Authority for Television and Radio]] uses a stripped-down, less detailed version of the code of conduct, which does indeed have the force of law.&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was drawn up in 1972, the document has been revised four times - in 1979, 1985, 1995 and 1998 - and expanded to four times its original size.&lt;ref name=Limor2002&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fairness and legal challenges==
It is one of the few national ethics codes to retain a version of the [[Fairness Doctrine]]. This is in addition to notions of impartiality drawn from similar European codes, which require the Authority itself to refrain from broadcasting editorials.&lt;ref&gt;According to Amit M. Schejter, the crucial clause is clause 22: "Beyond the word of the law the Authority has no voice, policy or point of view of its own. The Authority does not broadcast 'editorials'. The role of the Authority and its employees is to let different voices speak for themselves."&lt;/ref&gt; Fairness, however, goes beyond mere impartiality: in order to "ensure the public’s right to receive full and reliable information alongside balanced and
varied opinions", journalists are required to "solicit opposing opinion, fairly notify the public if comment was refused, and avoid becoming 'tools of response' for 'professional reaction teams.'"&lt;ref&gt;Rogel, Nakdimon and Schejer, Amit. ''The Nakdi Document: Guidelines for Covering News and Current Affairs'', Jerusalem: Israel Broadcasting Authority, 1998; Clauses 30-31.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements to ensure varied opinion - repeated elsewhere in the document&lt;ref&gt;Rogel, Nakdimon and Schejer, Amit. ''The Nakdi Document: Guidelines for Covering News and Current Affairs'', Jerusalem: Israel Broadcasting Authority, 1998; Clause 24.&lt;/ref&gt; as an enjoinder "that the pool of commentators must be varied", has caused several notable lawsuits to be filed against the IBA. Three in the 1980s were particularly notable: the first was against the landmark 1981 television miniseries ''The Pillar of Fire''. Brought by a group of Israelis of [[Sephardic]] descent who felt that the dramatised history of [[Zionism]] unfairly minimised their communities' contribution to the movement, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] indicated that in this case fairness was "irrelevant"; broadcast could not be censored, but "another aspect of the issue should be presented".&lt;ref name=Schejter1999&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, a decision by the IBA to ban interviews with any supporters of the [[Palestinian Liberation Organisation]] in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|West Bank and Gaza]] was struck down; this case was the making of the now-legendary [[civil rights]] lawyer Amnon Zichroni. And in 1984, Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]] submitted that a similar ban on broadcasting his political statements be struck down. In a much-studied ruling that recognised racist speech was also [[free speech|protected speech]], the [[Supreme Court of Israel|High Court of Justice]] attempted to curtail the ''Zichroni vs IBA'' somewhat: [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]] was permitted a "right of reply" if its positions were misrepresented, but it could not demand that its platform be broadcast, and nor could it demand the right of reply to criticism.&lt;ref name=Schejter1999/&gt;

==Recent concerns==
More recently, the guidelines have faced a sustained barrage of criticism. After the 1996 revision appeared, a study by Yitzhak Roeh, a media studies academic at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|HUJI]] called it an "anachronism" and "irrelevant"&lt;ref&gt;Roeh, Yitzhak. "The Nakdi Document: Guidelines for Covering News and Current Affairs: A Review'', [[Ha'aretz]], 28 July 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, right-wing groups have frequently used the Nakdi Document as a basis for documentation of what they see as [[media bias]]; the two most high-profile incidents have been litigation surrounding the broadcast of [[Avishai Raviv]]'s "swearing-in ceremony" with [[Eyal]] at [[Baruch Goldstein]]'s grave, and the campaign to get rid of [[Gabi Gazit]], whom they saw as serially breaking "the policies of public radio".&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, Greer. "[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1178431585287&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull The Gift of the Gab, sure, but no more Gabi]", [[Jerusalem Post]], 7 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although at least one study has concluded that rather than being responses to political stimuli, the various revisions of the Document have resulted in a "crystallization and implementation of normative ethical guidelines for Israeli public broadcasting",&lt;ref name=Limor2002/&gt; criticism that the Document contains at least some inherent bias continues to be leveled. Recently, concern that the language expected of the Israeli media was not sufficiently neutral included the complaint that the phrase "[[East Jerusalem]]" were prohibited by the guidelines.&lt;ref name="titleLRB � Yonatan Mendel: Diary"&gt;{{cite web

The Online Centres Network is a UK-based network which helps communities tackle social and digital exclusion.

[[Good Things Foundation]] coordinates the Online Centres Network of 5,000 community partners,  who provide free or low-cost access to computers and the internet. The organisation also provide training and support to hundreds of volunteers, centre staff  and community leaders, helping them to work within their own communities.

Over 2 million people have been helped to improve their skills through the Online Centres Network to date, with many learners also going on to further learning and increased employment opportunities.

In 2011 the management of the Online Centres Network (then known as UK online centres) was taken over by [[Good Things Foundation]] (formerly known as Tinder Foundation), a staff-owned mutual and social enterprise formed by the [[Sheffield]]-based team previously managing the UK online centres contract on behalf of Ufi Ltd. In July 2013, Online Centres Foundation became known as Tinder Foundation. Tinder Foundation officially received charity status in early 2016. In November 2016 Tinder Foundation [https://www.goodthingsfoundation.org/news-and-blogs/news/tinder-foundation-becomes-good-things-foundation rebranded as Good Things Foundation].

Good Things Foundation Chief Executive, Helen Milner, was inducted into the BIMA Digital Hall of Fame in 2012 alongside Sir Tim Berners Lee, Stephen Fry, and others noted for their work in the digital arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhalloffame.com/halloffamers |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915011727/http://www.digitalhalloffame.com/halloffamers |archivedate=15 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online learning==
In April 2011, [[Good Things Foundation]] (then known as Online Centres Foundation) launched a brand new learning platform Go ON, which was renamed Learn My Way in 2012 ([http://www.learnmyway.com/ http://www.learnmyway.com/]). The website was developed by Good Things Foundation with the aim of bringing together all of the resources on the market for internet beginners, including those developed specifically by Good Things Foundation, and from other providers including the [[BBC]] and Digital Unite. 
 
The new website contains four main sections:

'''Get ready,''' to tackle those basic literacy and numeracy skills before tackling any online skills.

'''Get started,''' which includes fun engagement resources to help get first time learners started.

'''Online basics,''' the course that was developed in conjunction with [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills|BIS]] and [[Becta]] to provide learners with all of the skills they need to get started with computers and the internet.

'''Learn more,''' which includes a number of popular courses including Facebook and socialising online, Shopping online and Using a computer.

'''What next,''' which contains resources to help learners progress, including details on volunteering opportunities.

myguide, the original learning platform which was developed by Online Centres Foundation ceased to exist in September 2011. The most popular courses that existed on myguide have been moved across to the new learning platform.

==Get Online Week==
[[Get online week|Get Online Week]] is an annual national campaign run by Good Things Foundation throughout the Online Centres Network, which helps tens of thousands of people to improve their computer and internet skills each year.

Get Online Week has been going since 2007, when the organisation then known as UK online centres first marked out a date in October to bring digital inclusion to national attention. Since then the campaign has grown into a week-long annual celebration, with thousands of events taking place each year in centres and more unusual locations, bringing digital skills and know-how to everyone.

Past Get Online Week partners and sponsors have included, Lloyds Banking Group, the [[BBC]], Go ON UK, Post Offices, [[BT Group|BT]], Three Mobile, Google, Sky, and Facebook.

==Digital Inclusion Statistics==
There are currently 12.6 million people who lack basic digital skills &lt;ref&gt;https://goon-uk-prod.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Basic%20Digital%20Skills_UK%20Report%202015_131015_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and 5.9 million who have never used the internet before.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/rdit2/internet-users/2015/stb-ia-2015.html&lt;/ref&gt; These people are likely to be socially excluded as well as lacking in online skills. Good Things Foundation and the Online Centres Network, along with their partners, are aiming to combat this digital and social exclusion.

The '''Open Content License''' is a [[share-alike]] [[public copyright license]] by [[Open Content Project]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt; The license can be applied to a work to make it [[open content]]. It is one of the earliest non-software free content licenses.

== History and reception ==
The Open Content License, dated July 14, 1998, predates the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL) and other non-software public licenses. Though discussions were held between [[David A. Wiley]], creator of the Open Content License, and [[Richard Stallman]], leader of the [[Free Software Foundation]], who created the [[GNU General Public License]] for software and would create the GFDL.&lt;ref name="grossman"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Grossman| first = Lev| title = New Free License to Cover Content Online| work = Netly News| accessdate = 2010-12-27| date = 1998-07-18| url = http://www.time.com/time/digital/daily/0,2822,621,00.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000619122406/http://www.time.com/time/digital/daily/0,2822,621,00.html |archivedate = 2000-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The license text is titled "OpenContent License (OPL)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opencontent.org/opl.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981206111937/http://www.opencontent.org/opl.shtml|archivedate=1998-12-06 |title=OpenContent License (OPL)}}&lt;/ref&gt; "OPL" stood for OpenContent Principles and License.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000816071511/http://www.opencontent.org/announce.shtml Updating the OpenContent License and Clarifying a Few Things]&lt;/ref&gt;

This license is not [[License compatibility|compatible]] with most other license (beside [[permissive license]]s) in that it requires derivative works to be licensed under the Open Content License ([[Viral license]]). With the exception of media and handling costs, it forbids charging for copies of a licensed work, but does not otherwise forbid commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19981206111937/http://www.opencontent.org/opl.shtml OpenContent License (OPL)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another license released a year later, also by the [[Open Content Project]], is called the [[Open Publication License]]. The OpenContent as well as the Open Publication license were succeeded by the [[Creative Commons license]]s in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030802222546/http://opencontent.org/ OpenContent is officially closed. And that's just fine. ] on opencontent.org (30 June 2003, archived)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt;

The OCL predates the GFDL (Nov 2002) and Creative Commons (Dec 2002) by over four years, while the improved OPL predates both by over three years. The OCL was developed primarily by me... The improved OPL was written primarily by Eric Raymond after discussions with me, Tim O’Reilly, and others... The OPL was truly innovative in that, in addition to requiring citation of the original author as source, it contained two license options which authors could choose to invoke: one restricts users’ abilities to creative derivative works, while the second restricts users’ abilities to make certain commercial uses of the material. The student of open content licensing will recognize that these are exactly the options that Creative Commons now employs. What may be forgotten is that in version 1.0 of the Creative Commons licenses, Attribution was actually included in the licenses only as an option. In version 2.0 of the CC licenses (May 24, 2004) attribution was standard on every license, and there were two licenses options: one regarding derivative works, and one regarding commercial use. So in terms of high level structure, the OPL was here about five years before CC. ... Actually, the [OCL and OPL] licenses weren’t that great, seeing as I am not a lawyer, and neither was anyone else involved in the creation of the license. The concept was right, and the execution was “good enough,” but Creative Commons (with its excellent lawyers and law school students) created a better legal instrument. As I said on the opencontent.org homepage on Monday June 30, 2003: 'My main goal in beginning OpenContent back in the Spring of 1998 was to evangelize a way of thinking about sharing materials, especially those that are useful for supporting education. ... I’m closing OpenContent because I think Creative Commons is doing a better job of providing licensing options which will stand up in court [and I'm joining] Creative Commons as Director of Educational Licenses. Now I can focus in on facilitating the kind of sharing most interesting to me ... with the pro bono support of really good IP lawyers... The OpenContent License and Open Publication License will remain online for archival purposes in their current locations. However, no future development will occur on the licenses themselves.' ... Anyone interested in a license like this is far better off using a Creative Commons license.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pathetic dot theory.png|thumb|right|The basic illustration of the pathetic dot theory]]
The '''pathetic dot theory''' or the '''New Chicago School theory''' was introduced by [[Lawrence Lessig]] in a 1998 article and popularized in his 1999 book, ''[[Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace]]''. It is a [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] theory of [[regulation]]. It discusses how lives of individuals (the pathetic dots in questions) are regulated by four forces: the [[law]], [[Norm (social)|social norms]], the [[Market (economics)|market]], and architecture (technical infrastructure).

==Theory==
Lessig identifies four forces that constrain our actions: the law, social norms, the market, and architecture.&lt;ref name="Levi-Faur2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Andrew D.|last=Murray|chapter=Internet regulation|editor=David Levi-Faur|title=Handbook on the Politics of Regulation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOKtKzEyQlYC&amp;pg=PA272|accessdate=March 19, 2013|date=January 1, 2011|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-0-85793-611-0|pages=272–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law threatens sanction if it is not obeyed. Social norms are enforced by the community.&lt;ref name="Levi-Faur2011"/&gt; Markets through [[supply and demand]] set a price on various items or behaviors.&lt;ref name="Levi-Faur2011"/&gt; The final force is the (social) architecture.&lt;ref name="Levi-Faur2011"/&gt; By that Lessig means "features of the world, whether made, or found"; noting that facts like biology, geography, technology and others constrain our actions.&lt;ref name=lessig1998&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lessig|first=Lawrence|title=The New Chicago School|journal=The Journal of Legal Studies|date=June 1, 1998|volume=27|issue=S2|pages=661–691|doi=10.1086/468039|jstor=10.1086/468039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, those four forces are the totality of what constrains our action, in fashion both direct and indirect, ''[[ex post]]'' and ''[[ex ante]]''.&lt;ref name="Levi-Faur2011"/&gt;

The theory has been formally called by Lessig in 1998 "The New Chicago School", and can be seen as a theory of regulation.&lt;ref name="Levi-Faur2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=lessig1998/&gt;

The theory can be applied to many aspects of life (such as how [[smoking]] is regulated), but it has been popularized by Lessig's subsequent usage of it in the context of the [[Internet regulation|regulation of the Internet]].&lt;ref name="Levi-Faur2011"/&gt; Lessig noted that the key difference in regulation of the Internet ([[cyberspace]]), compared to regulation of the "real world" ("realspace"), is the fact that the architecture of the internet&amp;nbsp;– the [[computer code]] that underlies all [[software]]&amp;nbsp;– is created by humans, whereas in the real world much of the architecture, based on laws of physics, biology, and major social and cultural forces, is beyond our control.&lt;ref name="Levi-Faur2011"/&gt; Lessig sees code as an important force that should be of interest to the wider public, and not only to the programmers.&lt;ref name="Marsden2000"&gt;{{cite book|first=Christopher T.|last=Marsden|title=Regulating the Global Information Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2qj3ZWI4VPEC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=March 19, 2013|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-24217-2|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes the importance of how technology-mediated architecture, such as coded software, can affect and regulate our behavior.&lt;ref name="KorpelaMontealegre2003"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Mikko|last1=Korpela|first2=Ramiro|last2=Montealegre|first3=Angeliki|last3=Poulymenakou|title=Organizational Information Systems in the Context of Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I9TpR5A188oC&amp;pg=PA360|accessdate=March 19, 2013|date=May 31, 2003|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-7488-2|page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessig wrote:

{{quote|[The code] will present the greatest threat to both liberal and libertarian ideals, as well as their greatest promise. We can build, or architect, or code cyberspace to protect values that we believe are fundamental. Or we can build, or architect, or code cyberspace to allow those values to disappear. There is no middle ground. There is no choice that does not include some kind of building. Code is never found; it is only ever made, and only ever made by us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Lawrence|last=Lessig|url=https://www.socialtext.net/codev2/code_is_law |title=Code Is Law / Code 2.0 |publisher=Socialtext.net |date=December 11, 2006 |accessdate=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Portal|Radio}}
[[Pirate radio]] exists in most countries in [[Europe]].

== Belgium (from international waters) ==
(See also Netherlands; many [[Dutch language]] stations were aimed at both countries)

*'''1962'''
::'''Radio Antwerpen''' broadcast from the concrete vessel ''Uilenspiegel''. Owner Georges De Caluwé died in December that year, and three days later the ship broke its anchor and ran aground across the border in the Netherlands.

*'''1973'''
::'''Radio Atlantis''' broadcast in Dutch from the [[Merchant vessel]] ''Mi Amigo''. When its contract was taken over by Radio Mi Amigo, Radio Atlantis transferred to the MV ''Jeanine'' in 1974 and added an English service, but its signal was poor and it closed on August 31, the day before the passage of the Dutch MOA, one hour after Radio Veronica and one hour before RNI.

*'''1974'''
::'''Radio Mi Amigo''' broadcast in Dutch from the MV ''Mi Amigo'' ([[Radio Caroline]]'s ship) 1974–1978, and from the MV ''Magdalena'' (1979).

== Denmark ==
*'''1958'''
::'''[[Radio Mercur]]''' begins transmissions from the '''MV Cheeta''' on August 2.

*'''1961'''
::'''DCR (Danmarks Commercielle Radio)''' begins transmissions from the '''MV Lucky Star''' on September 15. DCR later united with Radio Mercur.

*'''1962'''
::Radio Mercur ends transmissions due to a Danish law that prohibits assistance to illegal broadcasting directed to a Danish audience.

*'''2006'''
::Pirat radio 69 was located in the activist house "Ungdomshuset" in Copenhagen from December 14, 2006 to March 1, 2007.

*'''2012'''
::Byens Radio 89,7fm started broadcasting in central, Northern and Southern Copenhagen with micro powered radio equipment, inspired by Mbanna Kantako and his family from humanrightsradio.net (Springfield, Illinois, USA). It went on a week-long break starting mid-February 2012 after a detection van was spotted near the broadcasting site. As of May 15, 2012, Byens Radio has been broadcasting for the second longest period of time, for a pirate radio station in Denmark. The longest being '''[[Radio Mercur]]'''. Though it is the longest lasting non-commercial pirate radio station in the history of Denmark.
::The leftwing activist website Modkraft.dk &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ny piratradio hejser antennen over København|url=http://modkraft.dk/node/17171|publisher=Modkraft.dk|accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; has evidence that Byens Radio broadcast from December 31. The police's detection van never got close enough to stop the actual broadcasting but only encouraged the activist group behind the radio to move the broadcasting site elsewhere in order to avoid getting evicted. By moving from one base to another several times, the broadcasters were never found.

== Finland ==
In Finland, most pirate radio stations operated in the 1970s and the early half of the 1980s, because [[Yleisradio]] was the only legitimate broadcaster. In 1985, licenses were granted for local FM radio stations, which were able to offer a much wider variety of music, thus lessening the need for pirate radio stations. Since the end of the 1990s, FM piracy in Finland has all but died out.

== France (history of pirate radio) ==
The first wave was a political movement based mainly within French territory.  Most of these stations were short-lived. The first wave included Radio Verte, Radio Ivre, Radio Active and Radio Lorraine Coeur d'Acier. A few, such as [[Radio Verte Fessenheim]] became licensed stations.&lt;ref name=ecoutez&gt;''Écoutez la vraie différence ! radio verte Fessenheim, radio S.O.S. emploi-Longwy et les autres'', published 1997 by ''la Pensée sauvage'', editor Claude Collin, {{ISBN|978-2-85919-021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Italy ==
In early 70's some pirate radio started to broadcast using FM.
They were illegal till a decision of the supreme court in 1976 decided that every citizen has a right to broadcast on radio (and the government was supposed to be in charge of a new plan of frequency).

== Netherlands==
(See also Belgium)

*'''1960'''–'''1974'''
::'''[[Radio Veronica]]''' transmitted in Dutch on AM mediumwave (192 meter, 1562 kHz; later 538 meter, 557 kHz) from the [[MV Borkum Riff]] and after 1965 from the [[MV Norderney]] in international waters off the coast of [[Scheveningen]], and soon became the most popular radio station in the Netherlands. Broadcasts were targeted to the Netherlands only, transmitting power was deliberately kept moderate to avoid interference with international radio stations. Most broadcasts were recorded on shore in [[Hilversum]]. The station operated from April 1960 until August 1974, when the Dutch ratification of the Strassbourg treaty came into effect, after which Radio Veronica—then called VOO—became part of the regular Dutch broadcasting system, but was unable to retain its popularity. Radio Veronica is now an independent radio station

*'''1964'''
::'''Radio Noordzee''' and '''TV Noordzee''' transmitted in Dutch from [[REM Island]], an artificial construction resembling an early offshore oil platform. It was built in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and towed into a position off the coast of the Netherlands where it was assembled on site. The two stations were short lived and were forcibly closed by an air and sea attack by the [[Netherlands|Dutch Armed Forces]]. However, the funds solicited from the project by the REM island project were later used to launch a legitimate and fully licensed station in the Netherlands.

*'''1970'''
::'''[[Radio North Sea International|Radio Noordzee Internationaal]]''' ('''RNI''') broadcasting on AM, FM and international shortwave from the MV ''Mebo II'' which was originally anchored off the Netherlands. The ship moved for a time off the coast of south-eastern England where it was [[Radio jamming|jammed]] by a [[Royal Navy]] transmitter. The vessel then returned to the Netherlands. The owners of this station were involved in the [[Nigerian Civil War]]: ([[Biafra]]) and a complicated involvement with the sale of electronic equipment that featured in the trial of the men responsible for the [[Mebo Telecommunications#Lockerbie trial|Pan Am Flight 103 Lockerbie bombing]]. The end came for the MV ''Mebo II'' when the owners sold their offshore station to [[Libya]] as a revolutionary radio station. In the end Libya blew the vessel up and sank it for target practice.

*'''1970'''
::'''Capital Radio''' aboard the MV ''King David''. No connection to the legal British commercial radio group of [[Capital Radio|the same name]].

*'''1978'''
::'''[[Radio Delmare]]''' aboard the MV ''Martina". This vessel also took a generator to "Radio Caroline" then using the MV "Mi Amigo".

*'''1981'''
::'''Radio Paradijs''' made test broadcasts only from the MV ''Magda Maria (Lieve)'' which was anchored off the Netherlands before the station was forcibly closed.

*'''1984-1987'''
::'''[[Radio Monique]]''' aboard Radio Caroline's [[MV Ross Revenge]].

*'''1988-1989'''
::'''Radio 819''' (originally '''Radio 558''' prior to a frequency change) from the [[MV Ross Revenge]].

*'''1980–present'''
::There are still many Dutch pirate radio stations, mostly located in rural areas. It has been claimed{{where|date=October 2013}} that in 2011 approx 50% of all European Pirate Stations are located in the East-Netherlands. Especially the provinces of Twente, Friesland and Drenthe have a lot of pirate stations. Most of the pirate radio stations air the so called "pirate music", traditional Dutch folk music combined with classic English, German and Polka. These can be found particularly 1611 to 1700 kHz (This is called the X-Band.) Like many other European countries another hotspot is the 48 meter-band on [[Shortwave radio]]. The frequency is 6200-6500 kHz. Some can be found in the American part of the band (6900-7000) but is rare. There are about ~40 [[Pirate radio]] stations based in the Netherlands alone.

== Poland ==
In the 1980s, there were hundreds of short broadcasts of pre-recorded programs prepared and aired by a clandestine network of activists who called themselves Solidarity Radio ([[Radio Solidarność]]). Those programs, sometimes preceded by a leaflet campaign announcing an up-coming broadcast, were part of the broad-based Solidarity ([[Solidarność]]) workers, pro-democracy movement, which eventually succeeded in overcoming communism in Poland. Many Solidarity Radio organizers served time in prison for their activities.

== Sweden ==
*'''Early 1950s to May 31, 1952'''; '''Black Peter''' was run by the brothers John and Gunnar Figaro from their home in Lomsjö, a small village in southern [[Lapland, Sweden|Lappland]]. The transmission was suspected to transmit information from espionage resulting in a major hunt. [http://www.audiolabstockholm.com/blackpeter.pdf]
*'''1958'''
::'''Radio Mercur'''; '''Skånes Radio Mercur''', '''Radio Syd''' (at various times) from the MV ''Cheeta'' and later the MV ''Cheeta II'' which was also used at various times by '''TV Syd''' and for a time '''Radio Caroline South''' while the ship was anchored off South-east England. See: [http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/RP2/Syd01.shtml Radio Syd webpages] Radio Syd was shut down in January 1966 and the owner, Britt Wadner, moved to Gambia where she started a land based Radio Syd in May 1970 using the antenna from ''Cheeta II''.[http://home.swipnet.se/offshoreradio/radiosyd/]

*'''1961'''
::'''[[Radio Nord]]''' broadcasting in Swedish from the MV ''Bon Jour'' (later renamed ''Magda Maria'' and ''Mi Amigo''). This station was the behind-the-scenes creation of American [[Top 40]] broadcasting pioneer [[Gordon McLendon]] and [[Clint Murchison]], owner of the [[Dallas Cowboys]] [[American football|football]] team, both from [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. See: [http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/RP2/Nord01.shtml Pictures of the ship, transmitter &amp; personnel] and [http://www.ungermark.se/mediaradionordeng.html "The true Pirate Story"]

::As the MV ''Mi Amigo'', this radio ship would later be used to transmit under the names of: '''Radio 199'''; '''Radio Veronica'''; '''Radio Atlantis'''; '''Radio Seagull''', '''Radio Mi Amigo''' and '''Radio Caroline'''.

=== From international waters ===
*'''1928'''
::'''Ceto'''—The ''Ceto'' was a steam yacht reportedly renamed "Broadcasting Yacht" and fitted out for radio broadcasting purposes in 1928. Starting from off the coast of Dundee, Scotland, 'Daily Mail Radio/Radio Daily Mail' (reports vary) broadcast easy listening music to various points around the British coast as it cruised around the nation's coastline.  The sole sponsors of this voyage were Britain's ''[[Daily Mail]]'', ''Evening News'', and ''Sunday Dispatch'' newspapers, and the intent was not so much to set up an offshore station but rather to publicise the papers. The brain behind this publicity stunt was Valentine Smith, the Daily Mail's publicity officer.

*'''1960'''
::'''CNBC'''—([[Commercial Neutral Broadcasting Company]]) made test broadcasts in English from the MV ''Borkum Riff'' anchored off the Netherlands and also the home of the Dutch station [[Radio Veronica]]. The target audience was in south-eastern England, but due to the low power and distance the programs were not successful and they were terminated after a short period of time. However, the experiment gave rise to two other ventures which were planned for vessels anchored off the coast of south-eastern England.

::The first was '''GBLN''' which was also known as the '''Voice of Slough''' and the primary geographical target area of the transmissions. This vessel was to be based aboard the MV ''Ellen''. What made this station notable was the fact that U.S. [[Evangelism|evangelist]] [[Herbert W. Armstrong]], who financed by his daily paid broadcasts many of the successful offshore stations which followed, believed in the project to the extent that his broadcast called ''[[The World Tomorrow (1934)|The World Tomorrow]]'' was listed in the radio log of his worldwide magazine (''[[The Plain Truth]]''), as being heard at 8 p.m. daily at 306 metres in the [[medium wave]]: ([[Amplitude modulation|AM]]).
::Almost at the same time a spin-off venture from GBLN was created by '''GBOK''' which intended to broadcast from a former lightship known as the ''Lady Dixon''. Although the mainstream press reported on both stations at the time, neither venture came on the air.

*'''1964'''
::'''[[Radio Caroline]]''' began broadcasting on March 28 from aboard the MV ''Caroline'' (formerly MV ''Fredericia'') anchored off south-eastern England, later moved to anchorage off [[Isle of Man]]. The first voices from Radio Caroline included [[Simon Dee]], [[Carl Conway]], [[John Junkin]] and [[Christopher Moore (DJ)|Chris Moore]]. Some of the first programmes were recorded on land and taken out to the ship to be played as live.

::'''Radio Atlanta''' began broadcasting on May 12 from aboard the MV ''Mi Amigo'' from an anchorage close to Radio Caroline. The Mi Amigo had been previously used by '''[[Radio Nord]]''' to broadcast to Sweden. On July 2, 1964, Radio Caroline and Radio Atlanta agreed upon forming the [[Caroline Network]] while retaining independent owners of each station. As a result of this agreement Radio Caroline on board the MV ''Caroline'' sailed north, while the MV ''Mi Amigo'' remained at her original anchorage off south-eastern England using the callsign '''Radio Caroline South'''. Upon its arrival the now renamed '''Radio Caroline North''' broadcast to the north of England, the [[Isle of Man]], Ireland and a large part of Scotland.

::'''[[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]]''' began broadcasting from a former US minesweeper renamed MV ''[[MV Galaxy (radio ship)|Galaxy]]'' anchored in British territorial waters off South-east England. Following a warning from Radio Caroline, the station moved to a new location almost alongside Radio Caroline. "Big L", as it was known, was the most successful UK commercial radio station from within months of its start right up to its closedown in 1967, although by this time Radio Caroline was regaining lost ground.

::The station gained its 'Wonderful' appendage because it used a set of custom-recorded [[PAMS|PAMS jingles]] made in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. The Radio London format was later copied by the BBC to create '''Radio One''' and [[The Who]] incorporated the jingles into their album ''[[The Who Sell Out]]''. '''Big L''', as the station was fondly called, followed a similar format to [[KLIF (AM)|KLIF]] in [[Dallas]] where the station had been financed by car dealers and oil men who were friends and [[business]] associates of [[Don Pierson]] of [[Eastland, Texas|Eastland]], [[Texas]].

::'''Radio Invicta''' broadcasting from [[Maunsell Forts|Red Sands Fort]], an abandoned [[World War II|WWII]] British Army fortress on a sandbar in the [[Thames Estuary]]. The station did not last and it returned to the air as '''KING Radio''', which in turn gave way to '''Radio 390''' after a considerable financial investment had been made in the company and broadcasting site.

::Radio 390 was unique in that it had a good quality signal and transmitted a wide variety of programs from easy music to serials, children's programs, business programs, religious programs, plus news and weather bulletins. An episode of Patrick McGoohan's "Danger Man" (known in the U.S. as "Secret Agent Man") called "The Not-So-Jolly Roger" was filmed on Red Sands Fort in early 1966 when "Radio 390" was broadcasting (shut down a year later). The episode was broadcast 04 July of the same year.

::'''Radio Sutch''' broadcasting from Shivering Sands in 1964, a sandbar which was the location of another complex of towers (originally seven, though only five remained connected and one had capsized) off South-east England, which had also been a WWII British Army Fort left unstaffed after the war. Radio Sutch was named after its founder, the British [[rock music|rock artist]] [[Screaming Lord Sutch]] who took his style and a part of his name from the American artist [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]]. In September of that year Sutch sold the station to his musical manager Reg Calvert, who renamed it '''Radio City''' and set about upgrading its equipment.

*'''1965'''
::'''Radio Essex''' broadcast from a [[World War II]] [[Royal Navy]] barge which had been originally fitted with a sea fort and then towed to and sunk upon Knock John sandbar. This station was created by [[Roy Bates]], who later made claims that he had created the [[Principality of Sealand]] on yet another disused Royal Navy sunken barge. '''Radio Essex''' discovered that its location was within British territorial waters and following a court summons the station attempted to reinvent itself in 1966 as '''BBMS'''—'''Britain's Better Music Station'''. This low-power station mainly covered parts of the counties of [[Essex]], [[Kent]] and [[East Anglia]].

::'''[[Radio Scotland]]''' (also known as '''[[Radio Scotland and Ireland]]''') at various locations along the coast of Scotland and Northern Ireland from the former lightship ''Comet''. The station was the creation of [[Tommy Shields]].

*'''1966'''
::The '''Radio City Death:''' [[Reginald Calvert]], the manager of [[Screaming Lord Sutch]] and the owner of [[Radio City (pirate radio station)|Radio City]], was shot dead at the home of [[Oliver Smedley|Major Oliver Smedley]] in 1966 following falling out over a joint venture financing arrangement between Radio City and [[Radio Caroline]]. Calvert's former business associates had boarded his station, removed the transmitter crystals and put the station off the air.

::Due in part to the sensational death of Reg Calvert and lurid tales depicting real [[swashbuckler|swashbuckling piracy]], the British government were finally able to bring in legislation to make offshore broadcasting a part of British criminal law in the United Kingdom. Radio City stopped broadcasting after Mrs Calvert appeared in court charged under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1947. The station was said to be broadcasting within the 3-mile (6 km) limit. Radio City closed down shortly after Mrs Calvert lost the case.

::'''SRE'''—[[Swinging Radio England]] aboard the MV '''Laissez Faire''' anchored off south-eastern England. This station was also created and financed by Don Pierson and his business associates in [[Texas]].

::SRE followed a fast-paced "All-[[United States|American]]" [[top 40]] [[radio format]] similar to KBOX in Dallas, Texas, but the American [[disc jockey]]s had also grafted on a hybrid '[[Boss Radio|boss jocks]]' formula which had been employed by [[RKO Radio|RKO]] stations in the USA, although the hybrid was far more forceful and pounding than the original. The PAMS jingles used by SRE were the resung versions of those first used by [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] in [[New York City]]. SRE arrived around the time of the death of Reg Calvert, owner of '''Radio City''' and the political drive to bring in legislation to shut the offshore stations down. These and other unfortunate development brought about the rapid demise of SRE.

::At first the Texas owners wanted to rename the station ''Radio Holland'' and broadcast in Dutch to the Netherlands. Their plans went ahead after the name '''Radio Dolfijn''' had been selected instead. However, it was not long before the station changed its name yet again to '''Radio 227''' as a hybrid of a hybrid SRE in Dutch. This station closed in 1967 just prior to the [[Marine Broadcasting Offences Act]] becoming law.

::'''Britain Radio''' which called itself the ''Hallmark of Quality'', was a [[beautiful music]] format station in 1966. Its jingles also came from PAMS in Dallas and it shared something in common with '''SRE'''. Both stations were located in studios built in a container which had been lowered into the hold of the MV ''Laissez Faire''. This station was also created and originally financed by friends and associates of Don Pierson. However, '''Britain Radio''' did not last and it was replaced by '''Radio 355''' managed by [[Ted Allbeury]] who had successfully created '''Radio 390'''. Broadcasting two stations from the same ship created technical problems that the stations never managed to resolve, so their coverage was always less than they hoped for.

::'''Radio Tower''' and '''TV Tower''' attempted broadcasting in 1966 from another [[World War II]] [[Royal Navy]] barge which had also been fitted with a sea fort and then towed to and sunk upon Sunk Head sandbar. Only the radio station made test broadcasts and the TV station is alleged to have made a single, but unconfirmed test transmission.

::'''[[Radio 270]]''' aboard the MV ''Oceaan VII'' anchored off the [[Yorkshire]] coast of Northeast England in 1966.

::The comedy film ''[[The Boat That Rocked]]'' is a fictionalised and unrealistic view of offshore pirate radio, set in 1966.

*'''1967'''
::Following the introduction of the [[Marine Broadcasting Offences Act]] (Marine &amp; Etc. Broadcasting Offences Act) on August 14, 1967 at midnight, the only two offshore radio stations left on the British airwaves were broadcasting from the two Caroline Network stations which had enjoyed a semi-legal status with offices located in London and Liverpool. After the passage of the MBOA, the two stations soon began announcing themselves individually as '''Radio Caroline International'''.

*'''1970'''
::The two ship stations of '''Radio Caroline International''' eventually ran out of money in early 1968 and a salvage company towed them away for unpaid bills. But when a new and very powerful offshore radio station aboard the MV ''Mebo II'' anchored off the coast of South-east England in time for the British [[General Election]], it suddenly switched its name from '''Radio Northsea International'''—('''RNI'''), to '''Radio Caroline''' and began to lobby for the introduction of licensed commercial radio in the United Kingdom. As a result of this development the British Government resorted to [[Radio jamming|Jamming]] the station with a succession of increasingly powerful transmitters on the same frequency. After the election '''Radio Caroline''' fell silent once more and the radio ship moved back to the Netherlands where it became '''Radio Northsea International''' once again. Radio Caroline returned in Autumn 1972 originally off Holland, but 'came home' when it dropped anchor again off England in August 1974, from the MV Mi Amigo. In 1973 Caroline had solved the problem of broadcasting two frequencies simultaneously, although it was not until 1976-8 that this was done for any length time.

*'''1983'''
::In 1980, the MV ''Mi Amigo'' sank in a storm. The MV ''Caroline'' had been previously scrapped. In 1983 '''Radio Caroline''' returned to the airwaves from a larger ship called the MV '''[[Ross Revenge]]''', a super-trawler used by Ross Fisheries until the [[Cod Wars]] with [[Iceland]].

::The radio ship anchored off South-east England and became home to: '''Radio Caroline''' in English with part time services known as '''Caroline Overdrive''' playing album music programs and '''Caroline Viewpoint''' airing sponsored religious programs. Also on board was a Dutch service on another AM frequency (using the same technique as had been used on the ''Mi Amigo''), which was managed under contract to Dutch organizations and known variously as: '''Radio Monique''', '''Radio 558''' and '''Radio 819'''.

::On shortwave a third station operated a sponsored religious broadcasting station under the name of '''WMR'''—World Mission Radio with an over the air mailing address in [[California]], United States. Because of its American address, this station triggered international complaints to the US [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] during 1988 and 1989. The FCC was at that time engaged in legal casework over '''Radio Newyork International''', whose founder had previously been aboard the MV ''Ross Revenge'' helping to set up an earlier shortwave radio channel. In defence of its case for ''Radio Newyork International'' lawyers had submitted briefs to the US District Court citing the examples of '''Radio Caroline''' and the '''Voice of Peace''' as offshore broadcasting stations that had been left alone unchallenged by governmental interference. On August 19, 1989, Dutch authorities with British assistance, raided the MV ''Ross Revenge'' and shut down all transmissions.

*'''1984'''
::'''[[Laser 558]]''' broadcast from the MV ''Communicator'' and within a matter of months it gained an audience of millions. Lack of advertising due to UK laws starved the station off the air. However, it did return briefly in 1986 as '''Laser Hot Hits''' but the station did not last for the same reasons as before. The legacy of the original '''Laser 558''' was in its impact upon British broadcasting at the time, because it forced licensed stations to take note of the success of this short-lived offshore station and to attempt to incorporate its ideas and some of its personnel into their own programming.

*'''1990'''
::On November 5, 1990, the last "pirate" broadcast was made from the MV ''[[Ross Revenge]]'' and [[Radio Caroline]] in international waters; bringing to a close the story of Offshore Radio for the United Kingdom. After remaining silent for over a year, the vessel ran aground on the [[Goodwin Sands]] during a storm. Shortly after, the "Ross" was towed into port at [[Dover]], England on November 22, 1991. Details of subsequent, legal, operations of '''Radio Caroline''' can be found under its own [[Radio Caroline|article]].

Many household names that later broadcast from the BBC started their careers with the offshore broadcasters, including : [[Tony Blackburn]], [[Dave Cash (disc jockey)|Dave Cash]], [[Kenny Everett]], [[John Peel]] (briefly), [[Emperor Rosko]], [[Keith Skues]], [[Ed Stewart]], [[Dave Lee Travis]] and [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]].

The '''Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition''' (Firearms Protocol) is a [[treaty]] on anti-[[arms trafficking]] including [[Small Arms and Light Weapons]] that is supplemental to the [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]]. It is one of the so-called [[Palermo protocols]].

The Protocol was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] as Resolution 55/255 on 31 May 2001; the treaty entered into force on 3 July 2005. It was signed by 52 parties and as of October 2018 it has 116 parties, including 115 states and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name = ratifications&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XVIII-12-c&amp;chapter=18&amp;lang=en Signatures and ratifications].&lt;/ref&gt;

The states that have signed the protocol but have not yet ratified it are [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Germany]], [[Iceland]], [[Japan]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Monaco]], [[Seychelles]], and [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name = ratifications/&gt; Three of the top four arms manufacturers in the world—the [[United States]], [[Russia]], and [[France]]—did not sign the protocol.

A '''putative father''', with some variations in specific language, generally means a man whose legal relationship to a child has not been established but who is alleged to be or claims that he may be the [[biological father]] of a child who is born to a woman to whom he is not married at the time of the child's birth.&lt;ref name=CWIG&gt;{{cite news | author=Child Welfare Information Gateway | title=The Rights of Unmarried Fathers | url=http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/putative.cfm | work=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | date=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Putative+father | location=The Free Dictionary | title=Constitution and Laws of the United States | date=1856 |last=Bouvier | first=John | work=Law Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/putative-father/ | work= U.S. Legal .com | location= | title= Putative Father Law &amp; Legal Definition | date= | first= | last= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url= http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/P/Putativefather.aspx | work= | location= | title= Putative Father Definition | date= | first= Durhaime | last= Legal Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
There is no standard definition for the word "father" in statutes across the United States. Five States (as of 2010, Arizona, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, and Virginia{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}) as well as the [[District of Columbia]], [[American Samoa]], and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], provide no legal definition for the term at all.&lt;ref name=CWIG/&gt; Many states, however, have definitions for various categories of unwed fathers, with the term "putative father" being defined by statute in 13 States (as of 2017, these being Alabama&lt;ref&gt;http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/alison/codeofalabama/1975/26-10A-2.htm, &lt;/ref&gt;Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}).

The '''RECLAIM Act''' (Revitalizing the Economy of Coal Communities by Leveraging Local Activities and Investing More Act) was simultaneously introduced in the [[U.S. Senate]] and [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on March 27, 2017 by Senator [[Mitch McConnell]] (R-KY) and Representative [[Hal Rogers]] (R-KY-5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/728/text |title=Text - S.728 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): RECLAIM Act of 2017|first=McConnell,|last=Mitch|date=27 March 2017|website=www.congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill authorizes the use of funds generated by [[Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977]] (SMCRA) to be invested in communities adversely affected by the cessation of mining operations in the area.
[[File:PEABODY COAL COMPANY STRIP MINE, SOUTH OF COLSTRIP - NARA - 549167.jpg|thumb|PEABODY COAL COMPANY STRIP MINE, SOUTH OF COLSTRIP - NARA - 549167]]
==Background==
The RECLAIM Act's stated goal is to help communities across the United States, but much of the targeted area of support lies in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] region (such as the U.S. states of [[Kentucky]], [[Virginia]], and [[Tennessee]]). The RECLAIM Act was preceded by and amends the SMCRA, which was enacted in 1977 to decrease the amount of coal dust in downstream water resources and other mining operations that are harmful to wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act|url=https://www.nps.gov/subjects/energyminerals/smcra.htm|website=NPS.gov|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after SMCRA was established, the United States Department of Interior created the [[Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement]] (OSMRE) agency to enforce the law. OSMRE's purview includes protecting wildlife, restoring abandoned mines, and making sure the regulations for surface coal mining are complied with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Do|url=https://www.osmre.gov/|website=Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement|publisher=U.S. Department of Interior|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the agency has been charged with the administration of [[Abandoned mine|Abandoned Mine Land]] (AML) Reclamation Fund. Under the RECLAIM Act, AML funds will be disbursed over the next five years, giving up to $1 billion to help clean up and restore abandoned mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McConnell|first1=Mitch|last2=Rogers|first2=Hal|title=Reclaim Act represents massive environmental and economic revitalization of Appalachia|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/energy-environment/327179-reclaim-act-represents-massive-environmental-and|website=The Hill|publisher=The Hill|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
Section 416 amends the SMCRA by adding a section at the end of the bill that appropriates $200,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2017 to 2021. This money is to be used by U.S. states and [[Indian tribe]]s to "promote economic revitalization, diversification, and development in economically distressed mining communities through the reclamation and restoration of land and water resources adversely affected by coal mining carried out before August 3, 1977." The appropriated funds can only be used for certain priority projects. The project must meet the requirements of sections 403(a)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=91&amp;page=458#|title=Public Law 95-87|last=|first=|date=August 3, 1977 |website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (of 30 USC 1233&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:30%20section:1233%20edition:prelim)|title=30 USC 1233|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and 416(c) of the RECLAIM Act. Section 416(c) states that upon completion of the project, the reclamation should have created conditions for favorable development or conditions for the general welfare through development of communities. This section of the bill, the appropriations section, states that 30 percent of funds can be used for acid mine drainage treatment, 10 percent for project planning and administration and no more than 50 percent can be used for abandoned mine lands reclamation and restoration.

==Reactions==
The bill has generated support from a broad coalition of interests groups, such as Appalachian grassroots organizations&lt;ref name=":0", local officials, religious organizations&lt;ref name=":1", and environmental groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kftc.org/blog/kftc-members-travel-dc-lobby-reclaim-act|title=KFTC members travel to D.C. to lobby for the RECLAIM Act|last=Perumal|first=Nikita and Jacob Mack-Boll|date=October 24, 2017|work=Kentuckians For The Commonwealth|access-date=2018-03-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.powerplusplan.org/reclaim-act/|title=RECLAIM Act|website=POWER+ For The People|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;, religious organizations&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fcnl.org/documents/494|title=RECLAIM Act Letter From Faith-Based Groups to Congressional Leadership|last=Catholic Committee of Appalachia|first=et al.|date=December 8, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and environmentalist groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://content.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2016/12/sierra-club-applauds-senate-introduction-reclaim-act|title=SIERRA CLUB APPLAUDS SENATE INTRODUCTION OF RECLAIM ACT|last=|first=|date=2016-09-26|work=Sierra Club National|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worc.org/reclaim-act-advocates/|title=RECLAIM Act advocates meet with Congressional offices - WORC|date=2017-11-16|work=WORC|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The organizations argue that the bill will revitalize the economies of communities that were traditionally reliant upon coal mining. Polling in Eastern Kentucky suggests that Appalachian support for the bill is not limited to lobbying groups, approximately 89% of voters support this bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ieefa.org/strong-public-support-reclaim-act-eastern-kentucky/|title=Strong Public Support for RECLAIM Act in Eastern Kentucky - Institute for Energy Economics &amp; Financial Analysis|date=2016-09-27|work=Institute for Energy Economics &amp; Financial Analysis|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Riot dog''' is a term used by English-speaking media denoting any of the [[Free-ranging dog|stray dogs]] that, in recent years, accompany [[street protester]]s in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].&lt;ref name=news&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/technology/theres-only-one-kanellos-riot-dog-fans/story-e6frfro0-1225865078493 "Riot Dog fans"], [[News Corporation|News.com]], Australia, 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed that a number of these dogs remain among the protesters even when violent [[rioting]] breaks out.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13802940 "Greece's front-line riot dog"], BBC News, 17 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/further/2010/05/07-1 "With Dog on Your Side"] by Jon Queally, [[Common Dreams]], 5 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the dogs have been prominently featured in  media reportage on the protests.&lt;ref name=sun&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2964101/Demo-dog-loves-street-protests.html "Demo dog loves street protests"], ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', 7 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Greece's Riot Dogs have acquired, through the years, a large following of fans around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/grekisk-rebellhund-hyllas-pa-natet# "Grekisk rebellhund hyllas på nätet"] ("Greek rebel dog is hailed on the web"), ''Dagliga Nyheter'', 5 August 2010 (in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kampflieder.de/blogg/index.php/loukanikos-ein-griechischer-held/ "Ein griechischer Held"] ("A Greek Hero"), ''KampfLieder'', 11 October 2011 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;"Amid the turmoil of the Greece financial crisis, photos and videos of street protests have turned up a kind of canine "[[Where's Waldo]]" figure: a mutt that....clearly has a strong interest in civic disorder": From [https://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews/20100507/ts_ynews/ynews_ts1963 "Mysterious 'Rebel Dog' of Greek riots becoming latest Web icon"] by Brett Dykes, ''Yahoo News'', 7 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==The dogs==
'''Kanellos''' ({{Lang-gr|Κανέλλος}}: cinnamon), a distinct blonde, male, mixed-breed canine,&lt;ref name=wink&gt;[http://www.winknews.com/National-World/2010-05-07/Kanellos-the-Greek-protest-dog-makes-another-appearance "Kanellos the Greek protest dog makes another appearance"] ''[[WINK-TV]]'', [[CBS]] affiliate, 7 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; was arguably the first incarnation of the Greek Riot Dog. His maiden appearance was in photographs taken at a general assembly of students in the occupied [[National Technical University of Athens]]. Kanellos became famous in the [[2008 Greek riots]], when Greek photographers and cameramen started to notice a dog that kept appearing in their  footage.&lt;ref name=news /&gt;&lt;ref name=sun /&gt; The stray seemed to always walk amongst and side with the protesters.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;"The hound always seems to side with the protesters, whatever the dispute." From [https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2010/may/06/greece-protest?picture=362290833 "Kanellos the Greek protest dog"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 6 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to reports by witnesses, Kanellos, in his final years, suffered from [[arthritis]], which motivated a group of college students to collect money and purchase him a dog's [[wheelchair]]. This allowed him to live indoors, among the students, until he died.&lt;ref name=OK&gt;[http://rebeldog.tumblr.com/post/579120890/ok-lets-clear-this-out-rebel-dog-is-not "OK! let’s clear this out"] RebelDog website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thodoris''' ({{Lang|el|Θοδωρής}}) is a Kanellos look-alike, believed to be one of Kanellos' pups. Thodoris is a light golden-colored, mixed breed dog, who, despite being a stray, has seemingly been provided with all the necessary medical shots, as evidenced by his blue collar.&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;[http://photo.newsweek.com/2010/5/greek-protest-dogs.html "Mange Against the Machine"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620104951/http://photo.newsweek.com/2010/5/greek-protest-dogs.html |date=20 June 2010 }}, by Paul Katie, ''[[Newsweek]]'', May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Loukanikos''' ({{Lang|el|Λουκάνικος}}: the sausage [[loukaniko]]) or more commonly '''Louk''' ({{Lang|el|Λουκ}}), sometimes confused by the media for Kanellos,&lt;ref name=lib&gt;[http://libcom.org/gallery/loukanikos-greek-anarchist-dog "Loukanikos, the Greek anarchist dog"] LibCom, 8 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; has been present at nearly every recent protest in [[Athens]] in the past few years.&lt;ref name=lib /&gt; This stray has ostensibly become the symbol of [[Economy of Greece#2010-2011 debt crisis|Greek protests]] against the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]- and [[European Central Bank|ECB]]-prompted [[austerity]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/activist-hounding-greek-cabinet/story-e6frg6so-1226078057707 "Activist hounding Greek cabinet"], ''[[The Australian]]'', 20 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; There's uncertainty about the claim that Loukanikos and Thodoris may, in fact, be the same dog.&lt;ref name=black&gt;[http://capinero.blogspot.com/2012/01/blog-post_06.html "Kanellos and Thodoris Loukanikos"] by 'Karlo Krystaller', ''Black Capitalism'', 25 December 2011 (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2011, on the occasion of a striking policemen's union marching in the centre of Athens,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_27/09/2011_408306 "Police protest low salaries"], ''[[Kathimerini]]'', 27 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Loukanikos, according to eyewitnesses,&lt;ref name=black /&gt; was "initially confused" between two opposite sides both of uniformed policemen but, when the riot police contingent attacked their striking colleagues, the dog sided with "those who were being attacked."

Loukanikos' health was "severely burdened" by the inhaling of [[tear gas]] and other chemicals  during the many riots in which he participated&lt;ref name=avgi&gt;[http://www.avgi.gr/article/4346127/ena-antio-ston-loukaniko "Ena Adio Ston Loukaniko"] ("A Goodbye to Loukanikos"), ''[[I Avgi|Avgi]]'', 9 October 2014 (in [[Greek language|Greek]])&lt;/ref&gt; but lived until approximately ten years of age, dying peacefully on 9 October 2014 at the home of a person who cared for him.&lt;ref name=avgi/&gt;

==Other dogs==

In Chile, in the 2010s, a stray dog has been seen accompanying student protests. Reportedly, protesters nicknamed him "Negro Matapaco" or "Matapaco" (from Spanish ''matar'', to kill, and ''paco'', which is [[List_of_police-related_slang_terms#P|Chilean slang for "policeman"]]; his full nickname therefore translates to "black cop-killer"), or refer to him simply as "El Negro".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiEFhAAWCiw Documental Matapaco (2013)] (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]])&lt;/ref&gt;

==In culture==

In 2011, American singer/songwriter [[David Rovics]] released a song entitled "The Riot Dog".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dimokratianews.gr/content/751/%CE%B7-%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%AE-%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-lucky-%C2%AB%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BA%C2%BB "Η μικρή ιστορία του 'Lucky Λουκ'"] ("The short story of Lucky 'Louk' "), in ''Dimokratia'',  24 June 2011 (in [[Greek language|Greek]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Road Traffic Act 1930''' was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] introduced by the [[Secretary of State for Transport|Minister of Transport]] [[Herbert Morrison]].

==Context==
The last major legislation on road traffic was the [[Motor Car Act 1903]]. Amendments had been discussed in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1905/jun/28/motor-car-act-1903-amendment#S4V0148P0_19050628_HOC_159 1911|title=MOTOR CAR ACT (1903) AMENDMENT BILL|work=Hansard}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1913&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1913/jun/06/motor-car-act-1903-amendment-bill#S5CV0053P0_19130606_HOC_121|title=MOTOR CAR ACT (1903) AMENDMENT BILL|work=Hansard}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1914/apr/15/motor-car-act-1903-amendment-no-2-bill#S5CV0061P0_19140415_HOC_129|title=MOTOR CAR ACT (1903) AMENDMENT (No. 2) BILL.|work=Hansard}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the Motor Car Act (1903) Amendment Bill and Motor Car Act (1903) Amendment (No 2) Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/acts/motor-car-act-1903|title=Motor Car Act 1903|work=Hansard|accessdate=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1926 in which there were 4,886 fatalities in some 124,000 crashes a detailed set of national statistics (now known as [[Road Casualties Great Britain]]) has been collected.&lt;ref name=main2006&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/adobepdf/162469/221412/221549/227755/rcgb2006v1.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100209123301/http://www.dft.gov.uk/adobepdf/162469/221412/221549/227755/rcgb2006v1.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-02-09|title=Road Casualties Great Britain: 2006 - Annual Report|publisher=Department for Transport|page=92|quote=Road accident and casualty data was first collected on a national level in 1926. That year there were 4,886 recorded deaths in some 124,000 accidents."|accessdate=2010-01-09 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1929 that a new Road Traffic Bill was discussed in detail following a [[Royal Commission]] report on Transport, "The control of traffic on roads,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1929/jul/16/road-traffic-bill|title=ROAD TRAFFIC BILL|work=Hansard|date=1929-07-16|accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was adopted almost in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATID=9865&amp;CATLN=3&amp;Highlight=&amp;FullDetails=True&amp;j=1|title=Road Traffic and Safety Correspondence and Papers|publisher=National Archives|quote=The Royal Commission on Transport issued in 1929 a report entitled "The Control of Traffic on Roads" which was adopted almost in its entirety and as a result the Road Traffic Act 1930 was enacted which among other provisions gave the Minister power to make Regulations about the construction and use of mechanically propelled vehicles and provided for the installation of traffic signs and signals by highway authorities subject to the approval of the Minister.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a parliamentary debate on making speedometers compulsory in 1932 it was suggested that speed limits for cars were removed by this Act because "the existing speed limit was so universally disobeyed that its maintenance brought the law into contempt" rather that for considerations of safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1932/dec/01/motor-vehicles-and-speedometers#S5LV0086P0_19321201_HOL_3|title=Motor Vehicles and Speedmeters |work=Hansard|accessdate=2010-05-02|quote=It is sufficient to say that the reason why the speed limit was abolished was not that anybody thought the abolition would tend to the greater security of foot passengers, but that the existing speed limit was so universally disobeyed that its maintenance brought the law into contempt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clauses==
The Act repealed the [[Locomotive Acts|Locomotive Act]] of 1865, the [[Locomotives on Highways Act 1896]] and the [[Motor Car Act 1903]] and introduced many new regulations which controversially included the removal of all [[Road speed limits in the United Kingdom|speed limits on UK roads]] for motor cars.

The '''Rudd Concession''', a written [[concession (contract)|concession]] for exclusive mining rights in [[Matabeleland]], [[Mashonaland]] and other adjoining territories in what is today Zimbabwe, was granted by [[Lobengula|King Lobengula]] of Matabeleland to [[Charles Rudd]], [[James Rochfort Maguire]] and Francis Thompson, three agents acting on behalf of the South African-based politician and businessman [[Cecil Rhodes]], on 30 October 1888. Despite Lobengula's retrospective attempts to disavow it, it proved the foundation for the [[royal charter]] granted by the United Kingdom to Rhodes's [[British South Africa Company]] in October 1889, and thereafter for the [[Pioneer Column]]'s occupation of Mashonaland in 1890, which marked the beginning of white settlement, [[company rule in Rhodesia|administration]] and development in the country that eventually became [[Rhodesia (name)|Rhodesia]], named after Rhodes, in 1895.

Rhodes's pursuit of the exclusive mining rights in Matabeleland, Mashonaland and the surrounding areas was motivated by his wish to annex them into the [[British Empire]] as part of his personal ambition for a [[Cape to Cairo Railway]]—winning the concession would enable him to gain a royal charter from the British government for a [[chartered company]], empowered to annex and thereafter govern the [[Zambezi]]–[[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] watershed on Britain's behalf. He laid the groundwork for concession negotiations during early 1888 by arranging a treaty of friendship between the British and [[Northern Ndebele people|Matabele]] peoples{{refn|group=n|name=matabele1|}} and then sent Rudd's team from South Africa to obtain the rights. Rudd succeeded following a race to the Matabele capital [[Bulawayo]] against [[Edward Arthur Maund]], a bidding-rival employed by a London-based syndicate, and after long negotiations with the king and his council of ''[[inDuna|izinDuna]]'' (tribal leaders).

The concession conferred on the grantees the sole rights to mine throughout Lobengula's country, as well as the power to defend this exclusivity by force, in return for weapons and a regular monetary stipend. Starting in early 1889, the king repeatedly tried to disavow the document on the grounds of alleged deceit by the concessionaires regarding the settled terms; he insisted that restrictions on the grantees' activities had been agreed orally, and apparently considered these part of the contract even though the written text had been translated and repeatedly explained to him just before he signed it. He attempted to persuade the British government to deem the concession invalid, among other things sending emissaries to meet [[Queen Victoria]] at [[Windsor Castle]], but these efforts proved unsuccessful.

After Rhodes and the London consortium agreed to pool their interests, Rhodes travelled to London, arriving in March 1889. His amalgamated charter bid gathered great political and popular support over the next few months, prompting the Prime Minister, [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], to approve the royal charter, which was formally granted in October 1889. The Company occupied and annexed Mashonaland about a year later. Attempting to set up a rival to the Rudd Concession, Lobengula granted similar rights to the German businessman Eduard Lippert in 1891, but Rhodes promptly acquired this concession as well. Company troops conquered Matabeleland during the [[First Matabele War]] of {{nobreak|1893–1894}}, and Lobengula died from [[smallpox]] in exile soon after.

==Background==
[[File:Mzilikazi's migration from Zululand to Matabeleland, 1823 to 1838.png|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Mzilikazi]] led his [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] followers on two northerly migrations during the 1820s and 1830s. They became the [[Northern Ndebele people|Matabele]], and the area they settled in 1838 became [[Matabeleland]].|alt=A map. See description]]
During the 1810s, the [[Zulu Kingdom]] was established in southern Africa by the warrior king [[Shaka]], who united a number of rival clans into a centralised monarchy. Among the Zulu Kingdom's main leaders and military commanders was [[Mzilikazi]], who enjoyed high royal favour for a time, but ultimately provoked the king's wrath by repeatedly offending him. When Shaka forced Mzilikazi and his followers to leave the country in 1823, they moved north-west to the Transvaal, where they became known as the Ndebele or "[[Northern Ndebele people|Matabele]]"{{refn|group=n|name=matabele1|Their term for themselves in their own language is ''amaNdebele'' (the prefix ''ama-'' indicating the plural form of the singular ''Ndebele''), whence comes a term commonly used in other languages, including English: "Matabele". Their language is called ''[[Northern Ndebele language|isiNdebele]]'', generally rendered "Sindebele" in English, and the country they have inhabited since 1838 is called [[Matabeleland]]. In historiographical terms, "Matabele" is retained in the names of the [[First Matabele War|First]] and [[Second Matabele War]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb

|Sibanda

|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid the period of war and chaos locally called ''[[mfecane]]'' ("the crushing"), the Matabele quickly became the region's dominant tribe.&lt;ref name=davidson112113/&gt; In 1836, they negotiated a peace treaty with [[Benjamin d'Urban|Sir Benjamin d'Urban]], Governor of the [[British Cape Colony]],&lt;ref name=chanaiwa204&gt;{{Harvnb
|Chanaiwa
|2000
|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the same year [[Boer]] [[Voortrekkers]] moved to the area, during their [[Great Trek]] away from British rule in the Cape. These new arrivals soon toppled Mzilikazi's domination of the Transvaal, compelling him to lead another migration north in 1838. Crossing the [[Limpopo River]], the Matabele settled in the [[Zambezi]]–Limpopo watershed's south-west; this area has since been called [[Matabeleland]].&lt;ref name=davidson112113&gt;{{Harvnb
|Davidson
|1988
|pp=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matabele culture mirrored that of the Zulus in many aspects. The Matabele language, [[Northern Ndebele language|Sindebele]], was largely based on [[Zulu language|Zulu]]—and just like Zululand, Matabeleland had a strong martial tradition. Matabele men went through a Spartan upbringing, designed to produce disciplined warriors, and military organisation largely dictated the distribution of administrative responsibilities. The ''inkosi'' (king) appointed a number of ''[[inDuna|izinDuna]]'' (or indunas), who acted as tribal leaders in both military and civilian matters. Like the Zulus, the Matabele referred to a regiment of warriors as an ''[[impi]]''. The [[Shona people|Mashona people]], who had inhabited the north-east of the region for centuries, greatly outnumbered the Matabele, but were weaker militarily, and so to a large degree entered a state of tributary submission to them.&lt;ref name=davidson113115&gt;{{Harvnb
|Davidson
|1988
|pp=113–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mzilikazi agreed to two treaties with the Transvaal Boers in 1853, first with [[Hendrik Potgieter]] (who died shortly before negotiations ended), then with [[Andries Pretorius]]; the first of these, which did not bear Mzilikazi's own mark, purported to make Matabeleland a virtual Transvaal protectorate, while the second, which was more properly enacted, comprised a more equal peace agreement.&lt;ref name=keppeljones10&gt;{{Harvnb

After Mzilikazi died in 1868, his son [[Lobengula]] replaced him in 1870, following a brief succession struggle.&lt;ref name=davidson101&gt;{{Harvnb
|Davidson
|1988
|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tall and well built, Lobengula was generally considered thoughtful and sensible, even by contemporary Western accounts; according to the South African [[big-game hunting|big-game hunter]] Frederick Hugh Barber, who met him in 1875, he was witty, mentally sharp and authoritative—"every inch a king".&lt;ref name=davidson97&gt;{{Harvnb
|Davidson
|1988
|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based at his royal [[kraal]] at [[Bulawayo]],{{refn|group=n|name=bulawayo|"[[Bulawayo]]" was not one place. Like the Zulus, the Matabele did not have a permanent "capital" in the Western sense; instead, they had a royal [[kraal]], which relocated whenever a king died, or as soon as local sources of water and food ran out. Whenever a move took place, the old kraal was burned. The name "Bulawayo", applied to every Matabele royal town, dated back to the 1820s, when it was used by [[Shaka]] to refer to [[Bulawayo (Zulu empire)|his own]] royal town in Zululand. Lobengula's first Bulawayo was founded in 1870, and lasted until 1881, when he moved to the site of the modern city of the same name.&lt;ref name=ranger1417&gt;{{Harvnb
|Ranger
|2010
|pp=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Lobengula was at first open to Western enterprises in his country, adopting Western-style clothing and granting mining [[concession (contract)|concessions]] and hunting licences to white visitors in return for [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]], weapons and ammunition. Because of the king's illiteracy, these documents were prepared in English or Dutch by whites who took up residence at his kraal; to ascertain that what was written genuinely reflected what he had said, Lobengula would have his words translated and transcribed by one of the whites, then later translated back by another. Once the king was satisfied of the written translation's veracity, he would sign his mark, affix the royal seal (which depicted an elephant), and then have the document signed and witnessed by a number of white men, at least one of whom would also write an endorsement of the proclamation.&lt;ref name=davidson102&gt;{{Harvnb
|Davidson
|1988
|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For unclear reasons, Lobengula's attitude towards foreigners reversed sharply during the late 1870s. He discarded his Western clothes in favour of more traditional animal-skin garments, stopped supporting trading enterprises,&lt;ref name=davidson102/&gt; and began to restrict the movement of whites into and around his country. However, the whites kept coming, particularly after the discovery in 1886 of gold deposits in the [[South African Republic]] (or Transvaal), which prompted the [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]] and the founding of [[Johannesburg]]. After rumours spread among the Witwatersrand (or Rand) prospectors of even richer tracts, "a second Rand", north of the Limpopo, the miners began to trek north to seek concessions from Lobengula that would allow them to search for gold in Matabeleland and [[Mashonaland]].&lt;ref name=davidson107108&gt;{{Harvnb
|Davidson
|1988
|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts were mostly in vain. Apart from the [[Tati Concessions Land|Tati Concession]], which covered a small strip of land on the border with the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] where miners had operated since 1868,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Galbraith
|1974
|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; mining operations in the watershed remained few and far between.&lt;ref name=davidson107108/&gt;

The foremost business and political figure in southern Africa at this time was [[Cecil Rhodes]], a vicar's son who had arrived from England in 1870, aged 17.&lt;ref name=davidson37&gt;{{Harvnb
|Davidson
|1988
|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since entering the diamond trade at [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] in 1871, Rhodes had gained near-complete domination of the world diamond market with the help of [[Charles Rudd]], [[Alfred Beit]] and other business associates, as well as the generous financial backing of [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Rotberg
|1988
|pp=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodes was also a member of the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Parliament]], having been elected in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Rotberg
|1988
|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid the European [[Scramble for Africa]], he envisioned the annexation to the [[British Empire]] of territories that would connect the Cape, at Africa's southern tip, with [[Cairo]], the Egyptian city at the northern end of the continent, and allow for the construction of a [[Cape to Cairo Railway|railway linking the two]]. This ambition was directly challenged in the south by the presence of the [[Boer republics]] and, just to the north of them, Lobengula's domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Berlyn
|1978
|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the Zambezi–Limpopo region did not fall into any of the "[[sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]" defined at the {{nobreak|1884–85}} [[Berlin Conference]] further complicated matters; the Transvaalers, Germans and Portuguese were all also showing interest in the area, much to the annoyance of both Lobengula and Rhodes.&lt;ref name=davidson120124/&gt;

Rhodes began advocating the annexation by Britain of Matabeleland and Mashonaland in 1887 by applying pressure to a number of senior colonial officials, most prominently the [[High Commissioner for Southern Africa]], [[Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead|Sir Hercules Robinson]], and [[Sidney Godolphin Alexander Shippard|Sidney Shippard]], Britain's administrator in the [[British Bechuanaland|Bechuanaland Crown colony]] (comprising that country's southern part).

In September 1887, Robinson wrote to Lobengula, through Moffat, urging the king not to grant concessions of any kind to Transvaal, German or Portuguese agents without first consulting the missionary.&lt;ref name="keppeljones41"/&gt; Moffat reached Bulawayo on 29 November to find Grobler still there. Because the exact text of the Grobler treaty had not been released publicly, it was unclear to outside observers precisely what had been agreed with Lobengula in July; in the uncertainty, newspapers in South Africa were reporting that the treaty had made Matabeleland a protectorate of the South African Republic. Moffat made enquiries in Bulawayo. Grobler denied the newspaper reports of a Transvaal protectorate over Lobengula's country, while the king said that an agreement did exist, but that it was a renewal of the Pretorius peace treaty and nothing more.&lt;ref name=keppeljones41/&gt;

In [[Pretoria]], in early December, another British agent met [[Paul Kruger]], the President of the South African Republic, who reportedly said that his government now regarded Matabeleland as under Transvaal "protection and sovereignty", and that one of the clauses of the Grobler treaty had been that Lobengula could not "grant any concessions or make any contact with anybody whatsoever" without Pretoria's approval.&lt;ref name=keppeljones4243/&gt; Meeting at [[Grahamstown]] on Christmas Day, Rhodes, Shippard and Robinson agreed to instruct Moffat to investigate the matter with Lobengula and to secure a copy of the Grobler treaty for further clarification, as well as to arrange a formal Anglo-Matabele treaty, which would have provisions included to prevent Lobengula from making any more agreements with foreign powers other than Britain.&lt;ref name=keppeljones4243&gt;{{Harvnb

Lobengula was alarmed by how some were perceiving his dealings with Grobler, and so was reluctant to sign any more agreements with foreigners. Despite his familiarity with Moffat, the king did not consider him above suspicion, and he was dubious about placing himself firmly in the British camp; as Moffat said of the Matabele leadership in general, "they may like us better, but they fear the Boers more".&lt;ref name=keppeljones4243/&gt; Moffat's negotiations with the king and ''izinDuna'' were therefore very long and uneasy. The missionary presented the proposed British treaty as an offer to renew that enacted by d'Urban and Mzilikazi in 1836.&lt;ref name=chanaiwa204/&gt; He told the Matabele that the Boers were misleading them, that Pretoria's interpretation of the Grobler treaty differed greatly from their own, and that the British proposal served Matabele interests better in any case.&lt;ref name=davidson125127/&gt; On 11 February 1888, Lobengula agreed and placed his mark and seal at the foot of the agreement.&lt;ref name=davidson125127&gt;{{Harvnb

The document was unilateral in form, describing only what Lobengula would do to prevent any of these conditions being broken. Shippard was dubious about this and the fact that none of the ''izinDuna'' had signed the proclamation, and asked Robinson if it would be advisable to negotiate another treaty. Robinson replied in the negative, reasoning that reopening talks with Lobengula so soon would only make him suspicious. Britain's ministers at [[Government of the United Kingdom|Whitehall]] perceived the unilateral character of the treaty as advantageous for Britain, as it did not commit Her Majesty's Government to any particular course of action. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], the British Prime Minister, ruled that Moffat's treaty trumped Grobler's, despite being signed at a later date, because the [[London Convention (1884)|London Convention of 1884]] precluded the South African Republic from making treaties with any state apart from the [[Orange Free State]]; treaties with "native tribes" north of the Limpopo were permitted, but the Prime Minister claimed that Matabeleland was too cohesively organised to be regarded as a mere tribe, and should instead be considered a nation. He concluded from this reasoning that the Grobler treaty was ''[[ultra vires]]'' and legally meaningless. Whitehall soon gave Robinson permission to ratify the Moffat agreement, which was announced to the public in [[Cape Town]] on 25 April 1888.&lt;ref name=keppeljones4445/&gt;

For Rhodes, the agreement Moffat had made with Lobengula was crucial as it bought time that allowed him to devote the necessary attention to the final amalgamation of the South African diamond interests. A possible way out of the situation for Lobengula was to lead another Matabele migration across the Zambezi, but Rhodes hoped to keep the king where he was for the moment as a buffer against Boer expansion.&lt;ref name=rotberg251&gt;{{Harvnb

===Race to Bulawayo===

Rhodes faced competition for the Matabeleland mining concession from George Cawston and [[Edric Gifford, 3rd Baron Gifford|Lord Gifford]], two London financiers. They appointed as their agent [[Edward Arthur Maund]], who had served with [[Charles Warren|Sir Charles Warren]] in Bechuanaland between 1884 and 1885, towards the end of this time visiting Lobengula as an official British envoy. Cawston and Gifford's base in England gave them the advantage of better connections with Whitehall, while Rhodes's location in the Cape allowed him to see the situation with his own eyes. He also possessed formidable financial capital and closer links with the relevant colonial administrators. In May 1888, Cawston and Gifford wrote to [[Henry Holland, 1st Viscount Knutsford|Lord Knutsford]], the British [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]], seeking his approval for their designs.&lt;ref name=davidson128129&gt;{{Harvnb

The urgency of negotiating a concession was made clear to Rhodes during a visit to London in June 1888, when he learned of the London syndicate's letter to Knutsford, and of their appointment of Maund. Rhodes now understood that the Matabeleland concession could still go elsewhere if he did not secure the document quickly.&lt;ref name=rotberg252&gt;{{Harvnb

He is the only block to central Africa, as, once we have his territory, the rest is easy&amp;nbsp;... the rest is simply a village system with separate headmen&amp;nbsp;... I have faith in the country, and Africa is on the move. I think it is a second Cinderella."&lt;ref name=rotberg257258/&gt;

[[File:Charles Rudd.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Rudd]] was chosen to lead Rhodes's negotiators because of his prior bargaining experience with Boer farmers.|alt=A portrait photograph of a bearded man in a plain hat and jacket]]
Rhodes and Beit put Rudd at the head of their new negotiating team because of his extensive experience negotiating the purchase of Boers' farms for gold prospecting. Because Rudd knew little of indigenous African customs and languages, Rhodes added Francis "Matabele" Thompson, an employee of his who had for years run the reserves and compounds that housed the black labourers at the diamond fields. Thompson was fluent in [[Tswana language|Setswana]], the language of the [[Tswana people]] to Lobengula's south-west, and therefore could communicate directly and articulately with the king, who also knew the language. [[James Rochfort Maguire]], an Irish barrister Rhodes had known at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], was recruited as a third member.&lt;ref name=galbraith6162&gt;{{Harvnb

Many analysts find the inclusion of the cultured, metropolitan Maguire puzzling—it is often suggested that he was brought along so he could couch the document in the elaborate legal language of the English bar, and thus make it unchallengeable,&lt;ref name=rotberg257258&gt;{{Harvnb
|Rotberg
|1988
|pp=257–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as the historian John Galbraith comments, the kind of agreement that was required was hardly complicated enough to merit the considerable expense and inconvenience of bringing Maguire along.&lt;ref name=galbraith6162/&gt; In his biography of Rhodes, [[Robert I. Rotberg|Robert I Rotberg]] suggests that he may have intended Maguire to lend Rudd's expedition "a touch of culture and class",&lt;ref name=rotberg257258/&gt; in the hope that this might impress Lobengula and rival would-be concessionaires. One of the advantages held by the London syndicate was the societal prestige of Gifford in particular, and Rhodes hoped to counter this through Maguire.&lt;ref name=rotberg257258/&gt; Rudd's party ultimately comprised himself, Thompson, Maguire, J&amp;nbsp;G Dreyer (their Dutch wagon driver), a fifth white man, a [[Cape Coloured]], an African American and two black servants.&lt;ref name=keppeljones63&gt;{{Harvnb

Maund arrived in Cape Town in late June 1888 and attempted to gain Robinson's approval for the Cawston–Gifford bid. Robinson was reserved in his answers, saying that he supported the development of Matabeleland by a company with this kind of backing, but did not feel he could commit to endorsing Cawston and Gifford exclusively while there remained other potential concessionaires, most prominently Rhodes—certainly not without unequivocal instructions from Whitehall. While Rudd's party gathered and prepared in Kimberley, Maund travelled north, and reached the diamond mines at the start of July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Galbraith
|1974
|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July, in Bulawayo, agents representing a consortium headed by the South African-based entrepreneur Thomas Leask received a mining concession from Lobengula,&lt;ref name=keppeljones5657&gt;{{Harvnb
|Keppel-Jones
|1983
|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; covering all of his country, and pledging half of the proceeds to the king. When he learned of this latter condition Leask was distraught, saying the concession was "commercially valueless".&lt;ref name=keppeljones71&gt;{{Harvnb
|Keppel-Jones
|1983
|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moffat pointed out to Leask that his group did not have the resources to act on the concession anyway, and that both Rhodes and the London syndicate did; at Moffat's suggestion, Leask decided to wait and sell his concession to whichever big business group gained a new agreement from Lobengula. Neither Rhodes's group, the Cawston–Gifford consortium nor the British colonial officials immediately learned of the Leask concession.&lt;ref name=keppeljones71/&gt;

In early July 1888, Rhodes returned from London and met with Robinson, proposing the establishment of a [[chartered company]] to govern and develop south-central Africa, with himself at its head, and similar powers to the [[North Borneo Chartered Company|British North Borneo]], [[Imperial British East Africa Company|Imperial British East Africa]] and [[Royal Niger Company|Royal Niger Companies]]. Rhodes said that this company would take control of those parts of Matabeleland and Mashonaland "not in use" by the local people, demarcate reserved areas for the indigenous population, and thereafter defend both, while developing the lands not reserved for natives. In this way, he concluded, Matabele and Mashona interests would be protected, and south-central Africa would be developed, all without a penny from [[HM Treasury|Her Majesty's Treasury]]. Robinson wrote to Knutsford on 21 July that he thought Whitehall should back this idea; he surmised that the Boers would receive British expansion into the Zambezi–Limpopo watershed better if it came in the form of a chartered company than if it occurred with the creation of a new Crown colony.&lt;ref name=galbraith6364/&gt; He furthermore wrote a letter for Rudd's party to carry to Bulawayo, recommending Rudd and his companions to Lobengula.&lt;ref name=keppeljones64&gt;{{Harvnb

Between Kimberley and [[Mahikeng|Mafeking]], Maund learned from Shippard that Grobler had been killed by a group of [[Mangwato tribe|Ngwato]] warriors while returning to the Transvaal, and that the Boers were threatening to attack the British-protected Ngwato chief, [[Khama III]], in response. Maund volunteered to help defend Khama, writing a letter to his employers explaining that doing so might lay the foundations for a concession from Khama covering territory that the Matabele and Ngwato disputed. Cawston tersely wrote back with orders to make for Bulawayo without delay, but over a month had passed in the time this written exchange required, and Maund had squandered his head start on Rudd.&lt;ref name=galbraith6465&gt;{{Harvnb

===Negotiations===
Rudd, Thompson and Maguire immediately went to present themselves to Lobengula, who came out from his private quarters without hesitation and politely greeted the visitors.&lt;ref name=davidson132133&gt;{{Harvnb
|Rotberg
|1988
|pp=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a Sindebele interpreter, Rudd introduced himself and the others, explained on whose behalf they acted, said they had come for an amiable sojourn, and presented the king with a gift of [[Pound sterling|£]]100.&lt;ref name=rotberg259&gt;{{Harvnb

After the subject of business was eschewed for a few days, Thompson explained to the king in Setswana what he and his confederates had come to talk about. He said that his backers, unlike the Transvaalers, were not seeking land, but only wanted to mine gold in the Zambezi–Limpopo watershed.&lt;ref name=rotberg259/&gt; During the following weeks, talks took place sporadically. Moffat, who had remained in Bulawayo, was occasionally called upon by the king for advice, prompting the missionary to subtly assist Rudd's team through his counsel. He urged Lobengula to work alongside one large entity rather than many small concerns, telling him that this would make the issue easier for him to manage.&lt;ref name=rotberg260&gt;{{Harvnb
|Rotberg
|1988
|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then informed the king that Shippard was going to pay an official visit during October, and advised him not to make a decision until after this was over.&lt;ref name=rotberg260/&gt;

Accompanied by [[Hamilton Goold-Adams|Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams]] and 16 policemen, Shippard arrived in mid-October 1888. The king suspended concession negotiations in favour of meetings with him.{{#tag:ref|Shippard's visit was designed to help advance Rhodes's interests, but Rudd, who was unaware of Shippard's support, actually received his intervention with annoyance, complaining that it might delay the concession.&lt;ref name=rotberg260/&gt;|group="n"|name="delay"}} The colonial official told the king that the Boers were hungry for more land and intended to overrun his country before too long; he also championed Rudd's cause, telling Lobengula that Rudd's team acted on behalf of a powerful, financially formidable organisation supported by [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref name=rotberg260/&gt; Meanwhile, Rhodes sent a number of letters to Rudd, warning him that Maund was his main rival, and that because the London syndicate's goals overlapped so closely with their own, it was essential that Cawston and Gifford be defeated or else brought into the Rhodes camp.&lt;ref name=rotberg261/&gt; Regarding Lobengula, Rhodes advised Rudd to make the king think that the concession would work for him. "Offer a steamboat on the Zambezi same as [Henry Morton] [[Henry Morton Stanley|Stanley]] put on the [[Lualaba River|Upper Congo]]&amp;nbsp;... Stick to [[Home rule|Home Rule]] and Matabeleland for the Matabele[,] I am sure it is the ticket."&lt;ref name=rotberg261&gt;{{Harvnb
|Rotberg
|1988
|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As October passed without major headway, Rudd grew anxious to return to the Witswatersrand gold mines, but Rhodes insisted that he could not leave Bulawayo without the concession. "You must not leave a vacuum," Rhodes instructed. "Leave Thompson and Maguire if necessary or wait until I can join&amp;nbsp;... if we get anything we must always have someone resident".&lt;ref name=rotberg261/&gt; Thus prevented from leaving, Rudd vigorously tried to persuade Lobengula to enter direct negotiations with him over a concession, but was repeatedly rebuffed. The king only agreed to look at the draft document, mostly written by Rudd, just before Shippard was due to leave in late October. At this meeting, Lobengula discussed the terms with Rudd for over an hour.&lt;ref name=rotberg262&gt;{{Harvnb
|Rotberg
|1988
|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Helm]], a missionary based in the vicinity, was summoned by the king to act as an interpreter. According to Helm, Rudd made a number of oral promises to Lobengula that were not in the written document, including "that they would not bring more than 10 white men to work in his country, that they would not dig anywhere near towns, etc., and that they and their people would abide by the laws of his country and in fact be his people."&lt;ref name=keppeljones77&gt;{{Harvnb
|Keppel-Jones
|1983
|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After these talks with Rudd, Lobengula called an ''[[indaba]]'' (conference) of over 100 ''izinDuna'' to present the proposed concession terms to them and gauge their sympathies. It soon became clear that opinion was split: most of the younger ''izinDuna'' were opposed to the idea of any concession whatsoever, while the king himself and many of his older ''izinDuna'' were open to considering Rudd's bid. The idea of a mining monopoly in the hands of Rudd's powerful backers was attractive to the Matabele in some ways, as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small-time prospectors, but there was also a case for allowing competition to continue, so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula's favour.&lt;ref name=keppeljones76/&gt;

[[File:Martini-Henry m1871 - England - AM.032017.jpg|thumb|[[Martini–Henry]] rifles. Rudd's offer of 1,000 of these weapons, along with appropriate ammunition, proved key in persuading Lobengula to grant the concession.&lt;ref name=rotberg262/&gt;|alt=Two breech-loading rifles of late 19th-century vintage]]
For many at the ''indaba'', the most pressing motivator was Matabeleland's security. While Lobengula considered the Transvaalers more formidable battlefield adversaries than the British, he understood that Britain was more prominent on the world stage, and while the Boers wanted land, Rudd's party claimed to be interested only in mining and trading. Lobengula reasoned that if he accepted Rudd's proposals, he would keep his land, and the British would be obliged to protect him from incursions by the Boers.&lt;ref name=keppeljones76/&gt;

Rudd was offering generous terms that few competitors could hope to even come close to. If Lobengula agreed, Rudd's backers would furnish the king with 1,000 [[Martini–Henry]] breech-loading rifles, 100,000 rounds of matching ammunition, a steamboat on the Zambezi (or, if Lobengula preferred, a lump sum of £500), and £100 a month in perpetuity. More impressive to the king than the financial aspects of this offer were the weapons: he had at the time between 600 and 800 rifles and carbines, but almost no ammunition for them. The proposed arrangement would lavishly stock his arsenal with both firearms and bullets, which might prove decisive in the event of conflict with the South African Republic.&lt;ref name=keppeljones76&gt;{{Harvnb
|Keppel-Jones
|1983
|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weapons might also help him keep control of the more rambunctious factions amid his own ''impis''.&lt;ref name=rotberg262/&gt; Lobengula had Helm go over the document with him several times, in great detail, to ensure that he properly understood what was written.&lt;ref name=keppeljones77/&gt; None of Rudd's alleged oral conditions were in the concession document, making them legally unenforceable (presuming they indeed existed), but the king apparently regarded them as part of the proposed agreement nonetheless.&lt;ref name=chanaiwa206&gt;{{Harvnb

The final round of negotiations started at the royal kraal on the morning of 30 October. The talks took place at an ''indaba'' between the ''izinDuna'' and Rudd's party; the king himself did not attend, but was nearby. The ''izinDuna'' pressed Rudd and his companions as to where exactly they planned to mine, to which they replied that they wanted rights covering "the whole country".&lt;ref name=keppeljones77/&gt; When the ''izinDuna'' demurred, Thompson insisted, "No, we must have Mashonaland, and right up to the Zambezi as well—in fact, the whole country".&lt;ref name=keppeljones77/&gt; According to Thompson's account, this provoked confusion among the ''izinDuna'', who did not seem to know where these places were. "The Zambezi must be there", said one, incorrectly pointing south (rather than north).&lt;ref name=keppeljones77/&gt; The Matabele representatives then prolonged the talks through "procrastination and displays of geographical ignorance", in the phrase of the historian Arthur Keppel-Jones,&lt;ref name=keppeljones77/&gt; until Rudd and Thompson announced that they were done talking and rose to leave. The ''izinDuna'' were somewhat alarmed by this and asked the visitors to please stay and continue, which they did. It was then agreed that ''inDuna'' Lotshe and Thompson would together report the day's progress to the king.&lt;ref name=keppeljones77/&gt;

===Agreement===

After speaking with Lotshe and Thompson, the king was still hesitant to make a decision. Thompson appealed to Lobengula with a rhetorical question: "Who gives a man an ''[[assegai]]'' [spear] if he expects to be attacked by him afterwards?"&lt;ref name=keppeljones78/&gt; Seeing the allusion to the offered Martini–Henry rifles, Lobengula was swayed by this logic, and made up his mind to grant the concession. "Bring me the fly-blown paper and I will sign it," he said.&lt;ref name=keppeljones78/&gt; Thompson briefly left the room to call Rudd, Maguire, Helm and Dreyer in,&lt;ref name=keppeljones78/&gt; and they sat in a semi-circle around the king.&lt;ref name=rotberg262/&gt; Lobengula then put his mark to the concession,&lt;ref name=keppeljones78/&gt; which read:&lt;ref name=worgerclarkalpers241&gt;{{Harvnb

On the execution of these presents, I, Lobengula, King of Matabeleland, Mashonaland, and other adjoining territories, in exercise of my sovereign powers, and in the presence and with the consent of my council of ''indunas'', do hereby grant and assign unto the said grantees, their heirs, representatives, and assigns, jointly and severally, the complete and exclusive charge over all metals and minerals situated and contained in my kingdoms, principalities, and dominions, together with full power to do all things that they may deem necessary to win and procure the same, and to hold, collect, and enjoy the profits and revenues, if any, derivable from the said metals and minerals, subject to the aforesaid payment; and whereas I have been much molested of late by divers persons seeking and desiring to obtain grants and concessions of land and mining rights in my territories, I do hereby authorise the said grantees, their heirs, representatives and assigns, to take all necessary and lawful steps to exclude from my kingdom, principalities, and dominions all persons seeking land, metals, minerals, or mining rights therein, and I do hereby undertake to render them all such needful assistance as they may from time to time require for the exclusion of such persons, and to grant no concessions of land or mining rights from and after this date without their consent and concurrence; provided that, if at any time the said monthly payment of one hundred pounds shall be in arrear for a period of three months, then this grant shall cease and determine from the date of the last-made payment; and further provided that nothing contained in these presents shall extend to or affect a grant made by me of certain mining rights in a portion of my territory south of the Ramaquaban River, which grant is commonly known as the Tati Concession.|}}

As Lobengula inscribed his mark at the foot of the paper, Maguire turned to Thompson and said "Thompson, this is the epoch of our lives."&lt;ref name=keppeljones78/&gt; Once Rudd, Maguire and Thompson had signed the concession, Helm and Dreyer added their signatures as witnesses, and Helm wrote an endorsement beside the terms:&lt;ref name=keppeljones78&gt;{{Harvnb

{{Quote box|quote=I hereby certify that the accompanying document has been fully interpreted and explained by me to the Chief Lobengula and his full Council of Indunas and that all the Constitutional usages of the Matabele Nation had been complied with prior to his executing the same.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Charles Daniel Helm|align=center|width=60%}}

Lobengula refused to allow any of the ''izinDuna'' to sign the document. Exactly why he did this is not clear. Rudd's interpretation was that the king considered them to have already been consulted at the day's ''indaba'', and so did not think it necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might have felt that it would be harder to repudiate the document later if it bore the marks of his ''izinDuna'' alongside his own.&lt;ref name=keppeljones78/&gt;

===Announcement and reception===

Within hours, Rudd and Dreyer were hurrying south to present the document to Rhodes, travelling by mule cart, the fastest mode of transport available.{{#tag:ref|They nearly died on the road from [[dehydration]], but a group of Tswana rescued and briefly nursed them before sending them on their way. They switched to horses at Mafeking on 17 November.&lt;ref name=keppeljones7980/&gt;|group="n"|name="transport"}} Thompson and Maguire stayed in Bulawayo to defend the concession against potential challenges. Rudd reached Kimberley and Rhodes on 19 November 1888, a mere 20 days after the document's signing, and commented with great satisfaction that this marked a record that would surely not be broken until the railway was laid into the interior.&lt;ref name=keppeljones7980/&gt; Rhodes was elated by Rudd's results, describing the concession as "so gigantic it is like giving a man the whole of Australia".&lt;ref name=rotberg264&gt;{{Harvnb

|Keppel-Jones
|1983
|pp=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson was pleased to learn of Rudd's success. The High Commissioner wanted to [[public journal|gazette]] the concession immediately, but Rhodes knew that the promise to arm Lobengula with 1,000 Martini–Henrys would be received with apprehension elsewhere in South Africa, especially among Boers; he suggested that this aspect of the concession should be kept quiet until the guns were already in Bechuanaland. Rudd therefore prepared a version of the document omitting mention of the Martini–Henrys, which was approved by Rhodes and Robinson, and published in the ''[[Cape Times]]'' and ''[[Cape Argus]]'' newspapers on 24 November 1888. The altered version described the agreed price for the Zambezi–Limpopo mining monopoly as "the valuable consideration of a large monthly payment in cash, a gunboat for defensive purposes on the Zambesi, and other services."&lt;ref name=keppeljones7980/&gt; Two days later, the ''Cape Times'' printed a notice from Lobengula:&lt;ref name=keppeljones81&gt;{{Harvnb

{{Quote box|quote=All the mining rights in Matabeleland, Mashonaland and adjoining territories of the Matabele Chief have been already disposed of, and all concession-seekers and speculators are hereby warned that their presence in Matabeleland is obnoxious to the chief and people.

But the king was already beginning to receive reports telling him that he had been hoodwinked into "selling his country".&lt;ref name=galbraith7276/&gt; Word abounded in Bulawayo that with the Rudd Concession (as the document became called), Lobengula had signed away far more impressive rights than he had thought. Some of the Matabele began to question the king's judgement. While the ''izinDuna'' looked on anxiously, Moffat questioned whether Lobengula would be able to keep control.&lt;ref name=galbraith7276/&gt; Thompson was summoned by the ''izinDuna'' and interrogated for over 10 hours before being released; according to Thompson, they were "prepared to suspect even the king himself".&lt;ref name=davidson140&gt;{{Harvnb

===Lobengula's embassy===
[[File:Queen Victoria 1887.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Queen Victoria]] was referred to by the Matabele as the "White Queen".&lt;ref name=davidson145146/&gt; Lobengula sent emissaries to meet her with the hope of, among other things, ascertaining her existence.|alt=Queen Victoria in characteristic regalia.]]

While reassuring Thompson and Maguire that he was only repudiating the idea that he had given his country away, and not the concession itself (which he told them would be respected), Lobengula asked Maund to accompany two of his ''izinDuna'', Babayane and Mshete, to England, so they could meet Queen Victoria herself, officially to present to her a letter bemoaning Portuguese incursions on eastern Mashonaland, but also unofficially to seek counsel regarding the crisis at Bulawayo.&lt;ref name=galbraith7276/&gt; The mission was furthermore motivated by the simple desire of Lobengula and his ''izinDuna'' to see if this white queen, whose name the British swore by, really existed. The king's letter concluded with a request for the Queen to send a representative of her own to Bulawayo.&lt;ref name=davidson145146&gt;{{Harvnb
|Davidson
|1988
|pp=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maund, who saw a second chance to secure his own concession, perhaps even at Rudd's expense, said he was more than happy to assist, but Lobengula remained cautious with him: when Maund raised the subject of a new concession covering the [[Mazowe River|Mazoe]] valley, the king replied "Take my men to England for me; and when you return, then I will talk about that."&lt;ref name=galbraith7276&gt;{{Harvnb
|Galbraith
|1974
|pp=72–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johannes Colenbrander, a frontiersman from [[Colony of Natal|Natal]], was recruited to accompany the Matabele emissaries as an interpreter. They left in mid-December 1888.&lt;ref name=keppeljones85&gt;{{Harvnb
|Keppel-Jones
|1983
|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, a group of Austral Africa Company prospectors, led by Alfred Haggard, approached Lobengula's south-western border, hoping to gain their own Matabeleland mining concession; on learning of this, the king honoured one of the terms of the Rudd Concession by allowing Maguire to go at the head of a Matabele ''impi'' to turn Haggard away.&lt;ref name=keppeljones8688/&gt; While Robinson's letter to Knutsford made its way to England by sea, the Colonial Secretary learned of the Rudd Concession from Cawston and Gifford. Knutsford wired Robinson on 17 December to ask if there was any truth in what the London syndicate had told him about the agreed transfer of 1,000 Martini–Henrys: "If rifles part of consideration, as reported, do you think there will be danger of complications arising from this?"&lt;ref name=keppeljones81/&gt; Robinson replied, again in writing; he enclosed a minute from Shippard in which the Bechuanaland official explained how the concession had come about, and expressed the view that the Matabele were less experienced with rifles than with ''assegais'', so their receipt of such weapons did not in itself make them lethally dangerous.{{#tag:ref|He did not explore the possibility that their musketry might improve with practice, or that they might carry both ''assegais'' and rifles.&lt;ref name=keppeljones8182/&gt;|group="n"|name="musketry"}} He then argued that it would not be diplomatic to give Khama and other chiefs firearms while withholding them from Lobengula, and that a suitably armed Matabeleland might act as a deterrent against Boer interference.&lt;ref name=keppeljones8182&gt;{{Harvnb
|Keppel-Jones
|1983
|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surprised by the news of a Matabele mission to London, Rhodes attempted to publicly downplay the credentials of the ''izinDuna'' and to stop them from leaving Africa. When the envoys reached Kimberley Rhodes told his close friend, associate and housemate Dr [[Leander Starr Jameson]]—who himself held the rank of ''inDuna'', having been so honoured by Lobengula years before as thanks for medical treatment—to invite Maund to their cottage. Maund was suspicious, but came anyway. At the cottage, Rhodes offered Maund financial and professional incentives to defect from the London syndicate. Maund refused, prompting Rhodes to declare furiously that he would have Robinson stop his progress at Cape Town. The ''izinDuna'' reached Cape Town in mid-January 1889 to find that it was as Rhodes had said; to delay their departure, Robinson discredited them, Maund and Colenbrander in cables to the Colonial Office in London, saying that Shippard had described Maund as "mendacious" and "dangerous", Colenbrander as "hopelessly unreliable", and Babayane and Mshete as not actually ''izinDuna'' or even headmen.&lt;ref name=galbraith7778/&gt; Cawston forlornly telegraphed Maund that it was pointless to try to go on while Robinson continued in this vein.&lt;ref name=galbraith7778&gt;{{Harvnb
|Galbraith
|1974
|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhodes and the London syndicate join forces===

Rhodes then arrived in Cape Town to talk again with Maund. His mood was markedly different: after looking over Lobengula's message to Queen Victoria, he said that he believed the Matabele expedition to England could actually buttress the concession and associated development plans if the London syndicate would agree to merge its interests with his own and form an amalgamated company alongside him. He told Maund to wire this pitch to his employers. Maund presumed that Rhodes's shift in attitude had come about because of his own influence, coupled with the threat to Rhodes's concession posed by the Matabele mission, but in fact the idea for uniting the two rival bids had come from Knutsford, who the previous month had suggested to Cawston and Gifford that they were likelier to gain a royal charter covering south-central Africa if they joined forces with Rhodes. They had wired Rhodes, who had in turn come back to Maund. The unification, which extricated Rhodes and his London rivals from their long-standing stalemate, was happily received by both sides; Cawston and Gifford could now tap Rhodes's considerable financial and political resources, and Rhodes's Rudd Concession had greater value now the London consortium no longer challenged it.&lt;ref name=galbraith7880&gt;{{Harvnb
|Galbraith

There still remained the question of Leask's concession, the existence of which Rudd's negotiating team had learned in Bulawayo towards the end of October.&lt;ref name=keppeljones71/&gt; Rhodes resolved that it must be acquired: "I quite see that worthless as [Leask's] concession is, it logically destroys yours," he told Rudd.&lt;ref name=rotberg267&gt;{{Harvnb
|Rotberg
|1988
|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; This loose end was tied up in late January 1889, when Rhodes met and settled with Leask and his associates, James Fairbairn and George Phillips, in Johannesburg. Leask was given £2,000 in cash and a 10% interest in the Rudd Concession, and allowed to retain a 10% share in his own agreement with Lobengula. Fairbairn and Phillips were granted an annual allowance of £300 each.&lt;ref name=keppeljones91&gt;{{Harvnb
|Keppel-Jones
|1983
|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cape Town, with Rhodes's opposition removed, Robinson altered his stance regarding the Matabele mission, cabling Whitehall that further investigation had shown Babayane and Mshete to be headmen after all, so they should be allowed to board ship for England.&lt;ref name=galbraith79&gt;{{Harvnb
|Galbraith
|1974
|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobengula's enquiry===

Meanwhile, in Bulawayo, South African newspaper reports of the concession started to arrive in the middle of January 1889. William Tainton, one of the local white residents, translated a press cutting for Lobengula, adding a few embellishments of his own: he told the king that he had sold his country, that the grantees could dig for minerals anywhere they liked, including in and around kraals, and that they could bring an army into Matabeleland to depose Lobengula in favour of a new chief. The king told Helm to read back and translate the copy of the concession that had remained in Bulawayo; Helm did so, and pointed out that none of the allegations Tainton had made were actually reflected in the text. Lobengula then said he wished to dictate an announcement. After Helm refused, Tainton translated and transcribed the king's words:&lt;ref name=keppeljones8586&gt;{{Harvnb
|Keppel-Jones
|1983
|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|quote=I hear it is published in all the newspapers that I have granted a Concession of the Minerals in ''all'' my country to CHARLES DUNELL RUDD, ROCHFORD MAGUIRE [''[[sic]]''], and FRANCIS ROBERT THOMPSON.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
As there is a great misunderstanding about this, all action in respect of said Concession is hereby suspended pending an investigation to be made by me in my country.
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Lobengula|align=center|width=60%}}

This notice was published in the ''Bechuanaland News and Malmani Chronicle'' on 2 February 1889.&lt;ref name=keppeljones86/&gt; A grand ''indaba'' of the ''izinDuna'' and the whites of Bulawayo was soon convened, but because Helm and Thompson were not present, the start of the investigation was delayed until 11 March. As in the negotiations with Rudd and Thompson in October, Lobengula did not himself attend, remaining close by but not interfering. The ''izinDuna'' questioned Helm and Thompson at great length, and various white men gave their opinions on the concession. A group of missionaries acted as mediators. Condemnation of the concession was led not by the ''izinDuna'', but by the other whites, particularly Tainton.&lt;ref name=keppeljones86&gt;{{Harvnb
|Keppel-Jones
|1983
|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tainton and the other white opponents of the concession contended that the document conferred upon the grantees all of the watershed's minerals, lands, wood and water, and was therefore tantamount to a purchase receipt for the whole country. Thompson, backed by the missionaries, insisted that the agreement only involved the extraction of metals and minerals, and that anything else the concessionaires might do was covered by the concession's granting of "full power to do all things that they may deem necessary to win and procure" the mining yield. William Mzisi, a [[Fengu people|Fengu]] from the Cape, who had been to the diamond fields at Kimberley, pointed out that the mining would take thousands of men rather than the handful Lobengula had imagined, and argued that digging into the land amounted to taking possession of it: "You say you do not want any land, how can you dig for gold without it, is it not in the land?"&lt;ref name=keppeljones8688&gt;{{Harvnb
|Keppel-Jones
|1983
|pp=86–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson was then questioned as to where exactly it had been agreed that the concessionaires could mine; he affirmed that the document licensed them to prospect and dig anywhere in the country.&lt;ref name=keppeljones8688/&gt;

Helm was painted as a suspicious figure by some of the ''izinDuna'' because all white visitors to Bulawayo met with him before seeing the king. This feeling was compounded by the fact that Helm had for some time acted as Lobengula's postmaster, and so handled all mail coming into Bulawayo. He was accused of having hidden the concession's true meaning from the king and of having knowingly sabotaged the prices being paid by traders for cattle, but neither of these charges could be proven either way. On the fourth day of the enquiry, Elliot and Rees, two missionaries based at [[Inyati]], were asked if exclusive mining rights in other countries could be bought for similar sums, as Helm was claiming; they replied in the negative. The ''izinDuna'' concluded that either Helm or the missionaries must be lying. Elliot and Rees attempted to convince Lobengula that honest men did not necessarily always hold the same opinions, but had little success.&lt;ref name=keppeljones8688/&gt;

Amid the enquiry, Thompson and Maguire received a number of threats and had to tolerate other more minor vexations. Maguire, unaccustomed to the African bush as he was, brought a number of accusations on himself through his personal habits. One day he happened to clean his false teeth in what the Matabele considered a sacred spring and accidentally dropped some [[eau de Cologne]] into it; the angry locals interpreted this as him deliberately poisoning the spring. They also alleged that Maguire partook of witchcraft and spent his nights riding around the bush on a hyena.&lt;ref name=keppeljones8688/&gt;

Rhodes sent the first shipments of rifles up to Bechuanaland in January and February 1889, sending 250 each month, and instructed Jameson, Dr [[Frederick Rutherfoord Harris]] and a Shoshong trader, George Musson, to convey them to Bulawayo.&lt;ref name=rotberg266&gt;{{Harvnb
|Rotberg
|1988
|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobengula had so far accepted the financial payments described in the Rudd Concession (and continued to do so for years afterwards), but when the guns arrived in early April, he refused to take them. Jameson placed the weapons under a canvas cover in Maguire's camp, stayed at the kraal for ten days, and then went back south with Maguire in tow, leaving the rifles behind. A few weeks later, Lobengula dictated a letter for Fairbairn to write to the Queen—he said he had never intended to sign away mineral rights and that he and his ''izinDuna'' revoked their recognition of the document.&lt;ref name=rotberg269&gt;{{Harvnb

===Babayane and Mshete in England===

Following their long delay, Babayane, Mshete, Maund and Colenbrander journeyed to England aboard the ''Moor''. They disembarked at [[Southampton]] in early March 1889, and travelled by train to London, where they checked into the Berners Hotel on [[Oxford Street]]. They were invited to [[Windsor Castle]] after two days in the capital.&lt;ref name=davidson150152/&gt; The audience was originally meant only for the two ''izinDuna'' and their interpreter—Maund could not attend such a meeting as he was a British subject—but Knutsford arranged an exception for Maund when Babayane and Mshete refused to go without him; the Colonial Secretary said that it would be regrettable for all concerned if the embassy were derailed by such a technicality.&lt;ref name="galbraith79"/&gt; The emissaries duly met the Queen and delivered the letter from Lobengula, as well as an oral message they had been told to pass on.&lt;ref name=davidson150152&gt;{{Harvnb

The ''izinDuna'' stayed in London throughout the month of March, attending a number of dinners in their honour,&lt;ref name=davidson150152/&gt; including one hosted by the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]]. The Society sent a letter to Lobengula, advising him to be "wary and firm in resisting proposals that will not bring good to you and your people".&lt;ref name=rotberg271&gt;{{Harvnb
|Rotberg
|1988
|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diplomats saw many of the British capital's sights, including [[London Zoo]], the [[Alhambra Theatre]] and the [[Bank of England]]. Their hosts showed them the spear of the Zulu king [[Cetshwayo kaMpande|Cetshwayo]], which now hung on a wall at Windsor Castle, and took them to [[Aldershot]] to observe military manoeuvres conducted by Major-General [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]], the man who had given this spear to the Queen after routing the Zulus in [[Anglo-Zulu War|1879]]. Knutsford held two more meetings with the ''izinDuna'', and during the second of these gave them the Queen's reply to Lobengula's letter, which mostly comprised vague assurances of goodwill. Satisfied with this, the emissaries sailed for home.&lt;ref name=davidson150152/&gt;

}}

In late March 1889, just as the ''izinDuna'' were about to leave London, Rhodes arrived to make the amalgamation with Cawston and Gifford official. To the amalgamators' dismay, the Colonial Office had received protests against the Rudd Concession from a number of London businessmen and humanitarian societies, and had resolved that it could not sanction the concession because of its equivocal nature, as well as the fact that Lobengula had announced its suspension. Rhodes was originally angry with Maund, accusing him of responsibility for this, but eventually accepted that it was not Maund's fault. Rhodes told Maund to go back to Bulawayo, to pose as an impartial adviser, and to try to sway the king back in favour of the concession; as an added contingency, he told Maund to secure as many new subconcessions as he could.&lt;ref name=galbraith8384/&gt;

In London, as the amalgamation was formalised, Rhodes and Cawston sought public members to sit on the board of their prospective chartered company. They recruited the [[James Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Abercorn|Duke of Abercorn]], an affluent Irish peer and landowner with estates in [[County Donegal|Donegal]] and Scotland, to chair the firm, and the [[Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife|Earl of Fife]]—soon to become the Duke of Fife, following his marriage to the daughter of the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]]—to act as his deputy. The third and final public member added to the board was the nephew and heir apparent of the erstwhile Cabinet minister [[Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]], [[Albert Grey]], who was a staunch imperialist, already associated with southern Africa. Attempting to ingratiate himself with Lord Salisbury, Rhodes then gave the position of standing counsel in the proposed company to the Prime Minister's son, [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]].&lt;ref name=rotberg279&gt;{{Harvnb

|Galbraith

|pp=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhodes spent the next few months in London, seeking out supporters for his cause in the [[West End of London|West End]], the [[City of London|City]] and, occasionally, the rural estates of the landed gentry. These efforts yielded the public backing of the prominent imperialist [[Harry Johnston]], Alexander Livingstone Bruce (who sat on the board of the East Africa Company), and [[Alexander Bruce, 6th Lord Balfour of Burleigh|Lord Balfour of Burleigh]], among others. Along with Grey's active involvement and Lord Salisbury's continuing favour, the weight of this opinion seemed to be reaping dividends for Rhodes by June 1889.&lt;ref name=rotberg283/&gt; The amalgamation with the London syndicate was complete, and Whitehall appeared to have dropped its reservations regarding the Rudd Concession's validity.&lt;ref name=galbraith8384/&gt; Opposition to the charter in parliament and elsewhere had been for the most part silenced, and, with the help of Rhodes's press contacts, prominently [[William Thomas Stead]], editor of the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', opinion in the media was starting to back the idea of a chartered company for south-central Africa. But in June 1889, just as the Colonial Office looked poised to grant the royal charter, Lobengula's letter repudiating the Rudd Concession, written two months previously, arrived in London.&lt;ref name=rotberg283&gt;{{Harvnb
|Rotberg
|1988
|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maguire, in London, promptly wrote to the Colonial Office, casting doubt on the letter's character on the grounds that it lacked the witnessing signature of an unbiased missionary. He concurrently wrote to Thompson, who was still in Bulawayo, to ask if there was any sign that the king had been misled during the repudiation letter's drafting. Around the same time, Robinson's strident attacks on parliamentary opponents of the Rudd Concession led to Lord Salisbury replacing him with [[Henry Loch, 1st Baron Loch|Sir Henry Brougham Loch]]. Rhodes claimed not to be worried, telling Shippard in a letter that "the policy will not be altered".&lt;ref name=rotberg284285&gt;{{Harvnb
|Rotberg
|1988
|pp=284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, by the end of June 1889, despite the removal of Robinson and the sensation caused by Lobengula's letter rejecting the concession, Rhodes had got his way: Lord Salisbury's concerns of Portuguese and German expansionism in Africa, coupled with Rhodes's personal exertions in London, prompted the Prime Minister to approve the granting of a royal charter. Rhodes returned victorious to the Cape in August 1889, while back in London Cawston oversaw the final preparations for the chartered company's establishment.&lt;ref name=rotberg284285/&gt;

The charter incorporating the British South Africa Company committed it to remaining "British in character and domicile",&lt;ref name=rotberg285286/&gt; and defined its area of operations extremely vaguely, mentioning only that it was empowered to operate north of Bechuanaland and the Transvaal, and west of Mozambique. Northern and western bounds were not indicated. This was done deliberately to allow Rhodes to acquire as much land as he could without interference. The Company was made responsible for the safeguarding of peace and law in its territory, and licensed to do so "in such ways and manners as it shall consider necessary". It was vested with the power to raise its own police force, and charged with, among other things, abolishing slavery in all of its territories and restricting the sale of liquor to indigenous Africans. Local traditions were to be respected. The Company's charter was otherwise made extremely equivocal with the intention that this would allow it to operate freely and independently, and to [[Company rule in Rhodesia|govern and develop]] its acquired territories while also turning a profit.&lt;ref name=rotberg285286&gt;{{Harvnb

Rhodes capitalised the Company at £1,000,000, split into £1 shares, and used his other business interests to pump capital into it. Rhodes's diamond concern, De Beers, invested more than £200,000, while his gold firm, Gold Fields, put in nearly £100,000. He himself put in £45,000, along with another £11,000 jointly with Beit. Overall, about half of the Chartered Company's capital was held by its main actors, particularly Rhodes, Beit, Rudd and their confederates.&lt;ref name=rotberg285286/&gt; During the Company's early days, Rhodes and his associates set themselves up to make millions over the coming years through what [[Robert Blake, Baron Blake|Robert Blake]] describes as a "''[[:wiktionary:suppressio veri|suppressio veri]]''&amp;nbsp;... which must be regarded as one of Rhodes's least creditable actions".&lt;ref name=blake55&gt;{{Harvnb

This entity renamed itself the United Concessions Company in 1890, and soon after sold the Rudd Concession to the Chartered Company for 1,000,000 shares. When Colonial Office functionaries discovered this chicanery in 1891, they advised Knutsford to consider revoking the concession, but no action was taken.&lt;ref name=blake55/&gt;

Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony in July 1890 on the back of widespread support among Cape [[Afrikaners]]. He announced that his first objective as premier was the occupation of the Zambezi–Limpopo watershed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Davidson
|1988
|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Chartered Company had by this time raised the [[Pioneer Column]], a few hundred volunteers referred to as "pioneers" whose lot was to both occupy Mashonaland and begin its development. To this end its ranks were filled with men from all corners of southern African society, including, at Rhodes's insistence, several sons of the Cape's leading families. Each pioneer was promised {{convert|3000|acre|km2}} of land and 15 mining claims in return for his service.&lt;ref name=galbraith143153/&gt;

Lobengula impassively acquiesced to the expedition at the behest of his friend Jameson, much to the fury of many of the ''izinDuna'', who saw the column's march to Mashonaland as an appropriation of Matabele territory. Led by Major Frank Johnson and the famed hunter [[Frederick Selous|Frederick Courteney Selous]], and escorted by 500 [[British South Africa Police|British South Africa Company's Police]] under Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Pennefather,&lt;ref name=galbraith143153&gt;{{Harvnb
|Galbraith
|1974
|pp=143–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; the pioneers skirted their way around Lobengula's heartlands, heading north-east from Bechuanaland and then north, and founded [[Tuli, Zimbabwe|Fort Tuli]], [[Masvingo|Fort Victoria]] and Fort Charter along the way. They stopped at the site of the future capital, [[Harare|Fort Salisbury]] (named after the Prime Minister), on 12 September 1890, and ceremonially raised the [[Union Jack]] the next morning.&lt;ref name=keppeljones163172&gt;{{Harvnb

|pp=163–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration of Mashonaland did not immediately prove profitable for the Company or its investors, partly because of the costly police force, which Rhodes dramatically downsized in 1891 to save money. There also existed the problem of land ownership; Britain recognised the Company's subsoil rights in Mashonaland, but not its possession of the land itself, and the Company therefore could not grant titles to land or accept rents and other payments from farmers.&lt;ref name=rotberg336&gt;{{Harvnb

===Lippert concession===

Edward Renny-Tailyour, representing the [[Hamburg]] businessman Eduard Lippert—an estranged cousin of Beit—had been attempting to gain a concession from Lobengula since early 1888. Rhodes saw Lippert's activities as unwelcome meddling and so repeatedly tried (and failed) to settle with him. In April 1891, Renny-Tailyour grandly announced that he and Lobengula had made an agreement: in return for £1,000 up front and £500 annually, the king would bestow on Lippert the exclusive rights to manage lands, establish banks, mint money, and conduct trade in the territory of the Chartered Company. The authenticity of this document was disputed, largely because the only witnesses to have signed it, apart from ''inDuna'' Mshete, were Renny-Tailyour's associates, one of whom soon attested that Lobengula had believed himself to be granting a concession to [[Theophilus Shepstone]]'s son, "Offy" Shepstone, with Lippert merely acting as an agent. The Lippert concession therefore had a number of potential defects, but Lippert was still confident he could extract a princely fee for it from the Chartered Company; he named his price as £250,000 in cash or shares at par.&lt;ref name=galbraith273&gt;{{Harvnb
|Galbraith
|1974
|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhodes, backed by Loch, initially condemned the Lippert concession as a fraud and branded Lippert's locally based agents enemies of the peace. Loch assured Rhodes that if Lippert tried to gazette his agreement, he would issue a proclamation warning of its infringement on the Rudd Concession and the Company's charter, and threaten Lippert's associates with legal action. The Colonial Office agreed with Loch. Rhodes initially said that he would not pay Lippert's price, which he described as blackmail,&lt;ref name=galbraith273/&gt; but after conferring with Beit decided that refusing to buy out Lippert might lead to drawn-out and similarly expensive court proceedings, which they could not be sure of winning. Rhodes told Beit to start bargaining.&lt;ref name=galbraith274276/&gt; Lippert's agreement turned out to be an unexpected blessing for Rhodes in that it included a concession on land rights from Lobengula, which the Chartered Company itself lacked, and needed if it were to be recognised by Whitehall as legally owning the occupied territory in Mashonaland. After two months and a number of breakdowns in talks, Rudd took over the negotiations. He and Lippert agreed on 12 September 1891 that the Company would take over the concession from Lippert on the condition that he returned to Bulawayo and had it more properly formalised by Lobengula; in return the Company would grant the German {{convert|75|sqmi}} of his choice in Matabeleland (with full land and mineral rights), 30,000 shares in the Chartered Company and other financial incentives.&lt;ref name=galbraith274276&gt;{{Harvnb
|Galbraith
|1974
|pp=274–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of this plan hinged on Lobengula continuing to believe that Lippert was acting against Rhodes rather than on his behalf. The religious Moffat was deeply troubled by what he called the "palpable immorality" of this deceit,&lt;ref name=galbraith274276/&gt; but agreed not to interfere, deciding that Lobengula was just as untrustworthy as Lippert. With Moffat looking on as a witness, Lippert delivered his side of the deal in November 1891, extracting from the Matabele king the exclusive land rights for a century in the Chartered Company's operative territories, including permission to lay out farms and towns and to levy rents, in place of what had been agreed in April. As arranged, Lippert sold these rights to the Company, whereupon Loch approved the concession, expressing contentment at the solving of the Company's land rights problem; in an internal Whitehall memorandum, the Colonial Office affably remarked how expediently that administrative obstacle had been removed.&lt;ref name=galbraith274276/&gt; The Matabele remained unaware of this subterfuge until May 1892.&lt;ref name=davidson212214&gt;{{Harvnb

===Conquest of Matabeleland: the end of Lobengula===
[[File:Battle of the Shangani.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|At the [[Battle of the Shangani]] on 25 October 1893, during the [[First Matabele War]], 700 Company troops defeated over 3,000 Matabele warriors, killing about 1,500, while losing only four of their own number.

Lobengula's weakened Matabele kingdom uneasily coexisted with Rhodes's Company settlements in Mashonaland and north of the Zambezi for about another year. The king was angered by the lack of respect he perceived Company officials to have towards his authority, their insistence that his kingdom was separated from Company territory by a line between the [[Shashe River|Shashe]] and [[Manyame River|Hunyani Rivers]], and their demands that he stop the traditional raids on Mashona villages by Matabele ''impis''.&lt;ref name=farwell539&gt;{{Harvnb

Since the publication of ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'' in 1908, all [[Scouting|Scouts]] and [[Girl Guides]] around the world have taken a Scout (or Guide) promise or oath to live up to ideals of the movement, and subscribed to a [[Scout Law]]. The wording of the '''Scout Promise''' (or Oath) and Scout Law have varied slightly over time and from country to country. Some national organization promises are given below. Although most Scouting and Guiding organizations use the word "promise", a few such as the [[Boy Scouts of America]] tend to use "oath" instead. Typically, Scouts and Guides will make the [[Three-finger salute (Scouts)|three-fingered Scout Sign]] when reciting the promise.

==Original 1908 text==
In his original book on Boy Scouting, Baden-Powell introduced the Scout Promise, as follows:&lt;ref name="SfB"&gt;{{cite book | first = Lieut.-General R. S. S. | last = Baden-Powell, C.B., F.R.G.S. |authorlink = Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell | title = [[Scouting for Boys]] | edition = Part I | year = 1908 | publisher = Horace Cox | location = Windsor House, Bream's Buildings, London E.C. | page = 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;Before he becomes a scout, a boy must take the scout's oath, thus:
On my honour I promise that---
# I will do my duty to God and my king.
# to help others people, at all times.
# I know the scout law, and will obey it.
While taking this oath the scout will stand, holding his right hand raised level with his shoulder, palm to the front, thumb resting on the nail of the digitus minimus (little finger) and the other three fingers upright, pointing upwards:---
This is the scout's salute.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==World Organization of the Scout Movement requirements==
The form of the promise has varied slightly from country to country and over time, but must fulfill the requirements of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] (WOSM) to qualify a National Scout Organization for membership. Together with clarifying its [[Scout Law]], the Constitution of WOSM states:&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.scout.org/en/content/download/13661/118988/file/WOSMconstitutionE.pdf |title = WOSM Constitution and By-Laws |publisher = World Scout Bureau |accessdate = 10 March 2007 |date =  |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081116001638/http://www.scout.org/en/content/download/13661/118988/file/WOSMconstitutionE.pdf |archivedate = 16 November 2008 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Article II, paragraph 2: "Adherence to a Promise and Law"
All members of the Scout Movement are required to adhere to a Scout Promise and Law reflecting, in language appropriate to the culture and civilization of each National Scout Organization and approved by the World Organization, the principles of Duty to God, Duty to others and Duty to self, and inspired by the Promise and Law conceived by the Founder of the Scout Movement in the following terms:

The Scout Promise
&lt;poem&gt;On my honour I promise that I will do my best—
To do my duty to God and the King (or to God and my Country)
To help other people at all times and
To obey the Scout Law. &lt;/poem&gt;}}

In order to accommodate many different religions within Scouting, "God" may refer to a higher power, and is not specifically restricted to the God of the monotheistic religions. The WOSM Constitution explains "Duty to God" as "Adherence to spiritual principles, loyalty to the religion that expresses them and acceptance of the duties resulting therefrom."

The [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] (WAGGGS), which is a sister organization to WOSM, has the very same wording in their constitution (Part I, Article 2: Original Promise),&lt;ref name="constitution-wagggs"&gt;{{cite web

 |format=PDF|title = WAGGGS Constitution and Bye-Laws
 |publisher = WAGGGS World Bureau
 |accessdate = 10 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and follows similar policies.

===Alternative promises===
Although the Constitution of WOSM states that the Promise should include a reference to Duty to ''God'',&lt;ref name="constitution"/&gt; Scouting founder [[Lord Baden-Powell]] approved the use of promises with reference to a ''higher ideal'', ''higher truth'', an optional reference to God, or without a reference to God, for Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Finland.&lt;ref name="FundPrinc"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=6 August 2009
|url=http://www.ppoe.at/scoutdocs/relationships/wagggs_wosm_rel.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of these countries still offer this alternative promise (France, the Netherlands and Czech Republic). WOSM stated in 1932 that no new exceptions would be made and expressed the hope that the few remaining countries would stop using a promise without any reference to Duty to God.&lt;ref name="FundPrinc"/&gt;

The [[Scouting in Israel|Israeli Scouts]], though founded in 1919/1920, and joining WOSM in 1951 and WAGGGS in 1963, also have no "duty to God" or apparent equivalent in their promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;!-- Looking at their promise shows they don't have it. Someone who knows Hebrew may want to look at http://www.zofim.org.il/ and check. It is also possible that some of the subgroups have different promises. --&gt;

In 1969, the [[Eclaireuses et Eclaireurs israélites de France]] decided to discontinue using the reference to ''God'' due to its inconsistency with religious beliefs and practices from a [[Names of God in Judaism|Jewish perspective]]. Use of the word God (Dieu), derived from Zeus, can be seen as an inappropriate pagan reference in Jewish texts or education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Retrieved 1 September 2017. &lt;/ref&gt; [[Scouts Australia]] provides the option to use one of two different versions of the Scout Promise, one which allows scouts to promise "To be true to my spiritual beliefs [,] To contribute to my community and our world." The other option is to promise "To do my duty to my God, and To the Queen of Australia." &lt;ref&gt; YPR Team.

Retrieved 1 September 2017. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-WOSM Scouting==
Scout sections that follow [[traditional Scouting]], such as [[Baden-Powell Scouts]] within the [[World Federation of Independent Scouts]], use several promises including the original Scout promise above that includes the reference to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Self-defense''' ('''self-defence''' in some varieties of English) is a [[countermeasure]] that involves defending the [[health]] and well-being of oneself from [[harm]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/self-defense Dictionary.com's Definition of "Self-Defense"].

==Physical==

Physical self-defense is the use of physical force to counter an immediate threat of violence. Such force can be either armed or unarmed. In either case, the chances of success depend on a large number of parameters, related to the severity of the threat on one hand, but also on the mental and physical preparedness of the defender.

===Unarmed===
Many styles of [[martial arts]] are practiced for self-defense or include self-defense techniques. Some styles train primarily for self-defense, while other martial or [[combat sport]]s can be effectively applied for self-defense. Some martial arts train how to escape from a knife or gun situation, or how to break away from a punch, while others train how to attack. To provide more practical self-defense, many modern martial arts schools now use a combination of martial arts styles and techniques, and will often customize self-defense training to suit individual participants.

===Armed===
{{further|Non-lethal weapon|Melee weapon}}

A wide variety of [[weapons]] can be used for self-defense. The most suitable depends on the threat presented, the victim or victims, and the experience of the defender. Legal restrictions also greatly influence self-defence options.

In many cases there are also legal restrictions. While in some jurisdictions [[firearms]] may be carried [[Open carry in the United States|openly]] or [[Concealed carry|concealed]] expressly for this purpose, many jurisdictions have tight restrictions on who can own firearms, and what types they can own. [[knife|Knives]], especially those categorized as [[switchblade]]s may also be [[Knife legislation|controlled]], as may [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], [[pepper spray]] and personal [[Electroshock weapon|stun guns]] and [[Tasers]] - although some may be legal to carry with a license or for certain professions.

Non-injurious water-based self-defense indelible dye-marker sprays, or [[SmartWater (forensic)|ID-marker]] or [[SelectaDNA|DNA-marker]] sprays linking a suspect to a crime scene, would in most places be legal to own and carry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kentonline/news/2010/may/14/thugs_and_drunks_branded.aspx Branded a criminal - Red Offender spray is rolled out at Canterbury's nightspots (KentOnLine.co.uk, 13 May 2010)]. Retrieved on 2012-08-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Everyday objects, such as [[Maglite|flashlights]], [[baseball bat]]s, [[Millwall brick|newspapers]], [[Keychain|keyrings]] with keys, [[kitchen utensil]]s and other [[tool]]s, and [[aerosol can|hair spray aerosol cans]] in combination with a [[lighter]], can also be used as [[improvised weapon]]s for self-defense. [[Cable ties|Tie-wraps]] double as an effective restraint. Weapons such as the [[Kubotan]] (pocket stick) have been built for ease of carry and to resemble everyday objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://themartialist.net/pocket-sticks-for-self-defense/ Kubotans offering multiple uses].

==Mental==
{{Editorial|section|date=August 2017}}
Mental self-defense is the ability to get into the proper mindset for executing a physical self-defense technique. Many martial arts schools and self-defense classes focus primarily on the physical nature of self-defense and often neglect the mental aspect. If you are skilled in the physical aspects of a defensive technique, but lack the mental toughness and tenacity to execute it, you will not be able to perform - especially under duress. Controlled environments cannot easily mimic the stress and adrenaline dump which occurs during an attack. There is a very real need to be able to enter the proper "warrior mindset" if one is to have a realistic chance of surviving a potentially deadly encounter. This warrior mindset is the ability to focus purely on the successful outcome of a situation without becoming concerned with the consequences, even if they prove fatal in the dedicated pursuit of your desired outcome. The ability to go over, under, around or through any obstacle is the essence of this "never quit" mindset - similar to that of the [[Samurai]] of Japan. Self-preservation is a very powerful motivator and it is essential for ensuring that one has the mental toughness and proper mindset to emerge the victor in an encounter with one or more attackers/aggressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Survival-Self-Defense-Hand-Combat-Depends-ebook/dp/B00OU58CJ2/ref=sr_1_46?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415127395&amp;sr=1-46&amp;keywords=self%20defense|title=SELF-DEFENSE SURVIVAL GUIDE: Master Pete Canavan - How To Survive When Fighting For Your Life|author=Master Pete Canavan|publisher=PJC Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other forms==

===Avoidance===
Being aware of and avoiding potentially dangerous situations is one useful technique of self-defense. Attackers will typically select victims they feel they have an advantage against, such as greater physical size, numerical superiority or sobriety versus intoxication. Additionally, any [[ambush]] situation inherently puts the defender at a large initiative disadvantage. These factors make fighting to defeat an attacker unlikely to succeed. When avoidance is impossible, one often has a better chance at fighting to escape, such methods have been referred to as 'break away' techniques. Understanding the 'mindset' of a potential attacker is essential if we are to avoid or escape a potentially life-threatening situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stickgrappler.net/2012/10/self-defense-handling-stranger.html|title=SELF-DEFENSE: Lee Aldridge - Handling "Stranger" Confrontations: A 12Step Plan to Success ~ Stickgrappler's Sojourn of Septillion Steps|author=Stickgrappler|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===De-escalation===
[[Verbal Self Defense]], also known as Verbal Judo or Verbal Aikido,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Discover Verbal Aikido |url=http://www.verbal-aikido.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as using one's words to prevent, [[De-escalation|de-escalate]], or end an attempted assault.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{Cite book |title= Self-defense: steps to survival By Katy Mattingly |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dwOxP18guFgC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=%22Verbal+Self+Defense%22+define#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-07-28 |isbn= 978-0-7360-6689-1 |author1= Mattingly, Katy |date= July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a way of using words as weapons or as a shield. This kind of 'conflict management' is the use of voice, tone, and body language to calm a potentially violent situation before violence actually ensues. This often involves techniques such as taking a [[Child time-out|time-out]], and deflecting the conversation to individuals in the group who are less passionately involved, or simply entering into protected empathic position to understand the attacker better. Lowering an attacker's defence and raising their ego is one way to de-escalate a potential violent situation.

===Personal alarms===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Personal safety alarm.jpg|thumb|A personal safety alarm starts sounding once the emergency button is pressed.]] --&gt;
[[Personal alarm]]s are a way to practice passive self-defense. A personal alarm is a small, hand-held device that emits strong, loud, high-pitched sounds to deter attackers because the noise will sometimes draw the attention of passersby. Child alarms can function as locators or device alarms such as for triggering an alert when a [[swimming pool]] is in use to help prevent dangerous situations in addition to being a deterrent against would-be aggressors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://safety.lovetoknow.com/Child_Safety_Alarm Child Safety Alarms at LoveToKnow Safety].

==Self-defense education==
&lt;!--[[Women's self-defense]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
Self-defense techniques and recommended behavior under the threat of violence is systematically taught in self-defense classes. Commercial self-defense education is part of the [[martial arts industry]] in the wider sense, and many martial arts instructors also give self-defense classes.
While all martial arts training can be argued to have some self-defense applications, self-defense courses are marketed explicitly as being oriented towards effectiveness and optimized towards situations as they occur in the real world. It should not be presumed however that sport based systems are inadequate, as the training methods employed regularly produce well conditioned fighters experienced in full contact fighting. However, there is a difference between Martial Arts, and Self-Defense, and therefore as a general principle, Martial Arts is unsuited for Self-Defense application.
There are a large number of systems taught commercially, many tailored to the needs of specific target audiences (e.g. defense against attempted rape for women, self-defense for children and teens).
Notable systems taught commercially include:
* civilian versions of modern military [[combative]]s, such as [[Krav-Maga]], [[Defendo]], [[SPEAR System|Spear]], and [[Systema]]
*[[Jujutsu]] and arts derived from it, such as [[Aikijujutsu]], [[Aikido]], [[Bartitsu]], [[German ju-jutsu]], [[Kodokan Goshin Jutsu]].
* [[Model Mugging]]
* Traditional unarmed fighting styles like [[Karate]], [[Taekwondo]], [[Kung fu]], [[Hapkido]], [[Pencak Silat]], etc. These styles can also include competing.
* Traditional armed fighting styles like  [[Kali]] [[Eskrima]] and [[Arnis]]. These include competing, as well as armed and unarmed combat.
* Street Fighting oriented, unarmed systems, such as; [[Jeet Kune Do]], [[Kajukenbo]], [[Won Sung Do]], and [[Keysi Fighting Method]]

Sport based systems, such as [[boxing]], [[kickboxing]], [[Muay Thai]], [[savate]], [[shoot boxing]], [[Sanshou]], [[grappling]], [[judo]], [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]], [[mixed martial arts]], and [[wrestling]] are sport oriented, therefore are limited by their individual ruleset however they are often practiced in full contact and could be adapted for self-defense .{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Legal aspects==
{{main|Right of self-defense|Self-defence in international law}}

The self-defense laws of modern legislation build on the [[Roman law|Roman Law]] principle of ''dominium'' where any attack on the members of the family or the property it owned was a personal attack on the ''[[pater familias]]''.  In ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651), [[Hobbes]] argues that although some may be stronger or more intelligent than others in their natural state, none are so strong as to be beyond a fear of violent death, which justifies self-defense as the highest necessity.
In his 1918 speech ''Politik als Beruf'' ([[Politics as a Vocation]]), [[Max Weber]] defined a [[State (polity)|state]] as an authority claiming the [[monopoly on the legitimate use of force]] within defined territorial boundaries. Modern [[libertarianism]] characterizes the majority of laws as intrusive to personal autonomy and, in particular, argues that the right of self-defense from [[coercion]] (including [[violence]]) is a fundamental [[human right]]. In this context, note that Article 12 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states:
:No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.

Combined with the principle of the state's monopoly of legitimate force, this means that those authorized by the state to defend the law (in practice, the [[police]]) are charged with the use of necessary force to protect such rights. The right to self-defense is limited to situations where the immediate threat of violence cannot be prevented by those authorized to do so (in practice, because no police force is present at the moment of the threat). The right to self-defense granted by law to the private citizen is strictly limited. Use of force that goes beyond what is necessary to dispel the immediate threat of violence is known as excessive self-defense (also self-defense with excessive force).
The [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems have a theory of "abuse of right" to explain denial of justification in such cases.
Thus, [[Self-defence in English law|in English law]], the general [[common law]] principle is stated in ''Beckford v R'' (1988) 1 AD 130:
:"A defendant is entitled to use reasonable force to protect himself, others for whom he is responsible and his property. It must be [[Reasonable person|reasonable]]."
Similar clauses are found in the legislation throughout the [[western world]]. They derive historically from article 6 of the [[French Penal Code of 1791]], which ruled that "manslaughter is legitimate if it is indispensably dictated by the present necessity of legitimate defense of oneself or others".&lt;ref&gt;''L'homicide est commis légitimement, lorsqu'il est indispensablement commandé par la nécessité actuelle de la légitime défense de soi-même et d'autrui. ''&lt;/ref&gt; The modern French penal code further specifies that excessive self-defense is punishable due to "disproportion between the means of defense used and the gravity of the attack" defended against.&lt;ref&gt;''disproportion entre les moyens de défense employés et la gravité de l'atteinte'', [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=A0A14E45898737DC7438C9BD8BF07DBE.tpdjo08v_2?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006417218&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;dateTexte=20090602 Article 122-5].&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Law Commission Report on ''Partial Defenses to Murder'' (2004) Part 4 (pp78/86) recommends a redefinition of [[provocation (legal)|provocation]] to cover situations where a person acts lethally out of fear.

The present view of psychiatrists is that most people act in violent situations with a combination of fear and anger and that separating these two types of [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] is not legally constructive. In practice, however, self-defense laws still do make this distinction. [[German criminal law]] (§ 33) distinguishes "asthenic affect" (fear) from "sthenic affect" (anger). Excessive self-defense out of asthenic affect is not punishable.

===Application of the law===

In any given case, it can be difficult to evaluate whether force was excessive. Allowances for great force may be hard to reconcile with human rights.

The Intermediate People's Court of [[Foshan]], [[People's Republic of China]] in a 2009 case ruled the killing of a robber during his escape attempt to be justifiable self-defense because "the robbery was still in progress" at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjreview.com.cn/forum/txt/2009-04/28/content_193066.htm Are There Limits to Self-Defense?] Beijing Review, 28 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States between 2008 and 2012, approximately 1 out of every 38 gun-related deaths (which includes murders, suicides, and accidental deaths) was a justifiable killing, according to the [[Violence Policy Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martelle|first1=Scott|title=Gun and self-defense statistics that might surprise you -- and the NRA|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-guns-self-defense-charleston-20150619-story.html|accessdate=16 February 2018|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{lang|he-Latn|Smicha}}''' or '''{{lang|he-Latn|semikhah}}''' ({{lang-he-n|סמיכה}}, "leaning [of the hands]"), also {{lang|he-Latn|smichut}} ({{Hebrew|סמיכות}}, "[[ordination]]"), {{lang|he-Latn|smicha lerabbanut}} ({{Hebrew|סמיכה לרבנות}}, "rabbinical ordination"), or {{lang|he-Latn|smicha lehazzanut}} ({{Hebrew|סמיכה לחזנות}}, "cantorial ordination"), is derived from a Hebrew word which means to "rely on" or "to be authorized". 

Prevailing {{lang|he-Latn|smicha}} generally refers to the [[ordination]] of a [[rabbi]] or [[Hazzan|cantor]] within post-[[talmud]]ic [[Rabbinic Judaism]], and within all modern [[Jewish religious movements]] from [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]].&lt;ref name="jta.org"&gt;http://www.jta.org/2012/05/01/life-religion/whats-in-a-word-for-ordained-rather-than-invested-cantors-a-lot&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|he-Latn|Smicha lerabbanut}} signifies the transmission of rabbinic authority to give advice or judgment in [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. {{lang|he-Latn|Smicha lehazzanut}} signifies the transmission of authoritative knowledge about Jewish musical and liturgical traditions. Although presently most functioning [[synagogue]] rabbis hold {{lang|he-Latn|smicha lerabbanut}} by some rabbinical institution or academy, this was until quite recently not always required, and in fact many [[Haredi]] rabbis may not be required to hold a "formal" {{lang|he-Latn|smicha lerabbanut}} even though they may occupy important rabbinical and leadership positions. Some cantorial institutions in the US currently grant {{lang|he-Latn|smicha lehazzanut}} to their students, while others use the term "investiture" to describe the conferral of cantorial authority onto their graduates.&lt;ref name="jta.org" /&gt;

Classical {{lang|he-Latn|semikhah}} refers to a specific type of ordination that, according to traditional Jewish teaching, traces a line of authority back to [[Moses|Moshe ben Amram]], [[The Men of the Great Assembly]], and the [[Great Sanhedrin]]. The line of classical {{lang|he-Latn|semikhah}} died out in the 4th or 5th century A.D. but it is widely held that a line of Torah conferment remains unbroken. Some believe evidence existed that classical {{lang|he-Latn|semikhah}} was existent during the 12th century when {{lang|he-Latn|semuchim}} from Lebanon and Syria were traveling to Israel in order to pass on Torah conferment to their students.&lt;ref name="daat.ac.il"&gt;http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/hatkufa/mishpat-4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as Rav [[Yisroel of Shklov]] (1770–1839), believed {{lang|he-Latn|semikhah}} may not have been broken at all but that it continued outside of the land of Israel. Today many believe in the existence of an unbroken chain of rabbinical tradition dating back to the time of [[Moses|Moshe ben Amram]] ("Moses") and [[Joshua|Yehoshua ben Nun]] ("Joshua")&lt;ref name="pidyon.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pidyon.org/docs/shalshelet.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004013857/http://www.pidyon.org/docs/shalshelet.php |archivedate=2009-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="simpletoremember.com"&gt;http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/mesora/&lt;/ref&gt;  (See "[[#The unbroken chain of Torah|The Unbroken Chain of Torah]]" below).

A third and distinct meaning of {{lang|he-Latn|semikhah}} ("leaning") is the laying of hands upon an offering of a ''[[korban]]'' ("sacrifice") in the times of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], see [[Semicha in sacrifices|Semikhah in sacrifices]].

==Hebrew Bible==
According to the [[Tanakh]], the [[Hebrew Bible]], [[Moses]] ordained [[Joshua]] through ''semikhah''. ({{Bibleverse|Num||27:15–23|HE}}, {{Bibleverse|Deut||34:9|HE}}). Moses also ordained the 70 elders ({{Bibleverse|Num||11:16–25|HE}}). The elders later ordained their successors in this way. Their successors in turn ordained others. This chain of hands-on ''semikhah'' continued through the time of the [[Second Temple]], to an undetermined time.{{Or|date=September 2011}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Traditionally Moses is also assumed to be the "first rabbi" of the [[Israelites]]. He is still known to most Jews as ''Moshe Rabbeinu'' ("Moses our Teacher"). Moses was also a [[Nevi'im|prophet]], and it is a [[Jewish principles of faith#Moses and the Torah|fundamental Jewish belief]] that he was the greatest of all the Torah's prophets. Moses passed his leadership on to Joshua as commanded by God in the [[Book of Numbers]] where the subject of ''semikhah'' ("laying [of hands]" or "ordination") is first mentioned in the Torah:

*Book of Numbers: "Moses spoke to God, saying, 'Let the Omnipotent God of all living souls appoint a man over the community. Let him come and go before them, and let him bring them forth and lead them. Let God's community not be like sheep that have no shepherd.' God said to Moses, 'Take Joshua son of Nun, a man of spirit, and '''lay your hands on him'''{{'}}. Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and before the entire community, and let them see you commission him. Invest him with some of your splendor so that the entire Israelite community will obey him. Let him stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall seek the decision of the Urim before God on his behalf. By this word, along with all the Israelites and the entire community shall he come and go.' Moses did as God had ordered him. He took Joshua and had him stand before Eleazar the priest and before the entire community. '''He then laid his hands on him and commissioned him as God had commanded Moses'''." ({{Bibleverse|Num||27:15–23|HE}})
*[[Book of Deuteronomy]]: "Joshua son of Nun was filled with a spirit of wisdom, because '''Moses had laid his hands on him'''. The Israelites therefore listened to him, doing as God had commanded Moses." (Deuteronomy 34:9)

==Mishnah and Talmud==
Despite the name, the classical semikhah did not actually require a literal laying on of hands; the operative part of the ceremony consisted of a court of three, at least one of whom himself had semikhah, conferring the authority on the recipient.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud,[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Sanhedrin13b.jpg Sanhedrin 13b]&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the givers and the recipient had to be in the Land of Israel, but they did not have to be in the same place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mechon-mamre.org/i/e104.htm Maimonides, Sanhedrin  ch 4]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Mishnaic era it became the law that only someone who had ''semikhah'' could give religious and legal decisions.&lt;ref name=sanh5a&gt;[http://images.e-daf.com/DafImg.asp?ID=3620&amp;size=1 Talmud Sanhedrin 5b]&lt;/ref&gt;

The title ''ribbi'' (or "rabbi") was reserved for those with semikhah. The sages of the Babylonian Jewish community had a similar religious education, but without the semikhah ceremony they were called ''rav.'' The Talmud also relates that one can obtain the title of Rabbi by those to whom he teaches or counsels.

After the failed [[Bar Kochba's revolt|revolution]] by [[Simon bar Kokhba|Bar Kokhba]] in 132–135 CE, the Romans put down the revolt, and the emperor [[Hadrian]] tried to put a permanent end to the [[Sanhedrin]], the supreme legislative and religious body of the Jewish people. According to the Talmud, Hadrian decreed that anyone who gave or accepted semikhah would be killed, any city in which the ceremony took place would be razed, and all crops within a mile of the ceremony's site would be destroyed. The line of succession was saved by Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava's martyrdom: he took no other rabbis with him, and five students of the recently martyred Rabbi Akiva, to a mountain pass far from any settlement or farm, and this one Rabbi ordained all five students. These new Rabbis were: Rabbi Meir, Rabbi Shimon, Rabbi Yehudah (ben Ila’i), Rabbi Yosi and Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua – an entire generation of Torah leadership.  When the Romans attacked them, Rabbi Yehuda blocked the pass with his body allowing the others to escape and became one of Judaism's ten Rabbinic Martyrs himself by being speared 300 times. Hence, semikhah is also granted from one Rabbi to a new Rabbi, without the need of two witnesses, and the above five Rabbis carried on this tradition. The footnote gives a page of Talmud in Aramaic. See Sanhedrin 14a.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Sanhedrin13b.jpg Talmud, Sanhedrin 14a]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact date that the original ''semikhah'' succession ended is not certain.  Many medieval authorities believed that this occurred during the reign of Hillel II, around the year 360 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Nachmanides, ''Sefer Hazekhut'', Gittin ch 4; Rabbenu Nissim, ibid; ''Sefer Haterumot'', Gate 45; R Levi ibn Haviv, ''Kuntras Hasemikhah''.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Theodosius I]] forbade the Sanhedrin to assemble and declared [[Semicha|ordination]] illegal. (Roman law prescribed capital punishment for any Rabbi who received ordination and complete destruction of the town where the ordination occurred).&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the Jewish People'', by Hayim Ben-Sasson, Harvard University Press (October 15, 1985), {{ISBN|978-0-674-39731-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems to have continued until at least 425, when [[Theodosius II]] executed [[Gamaliel VI]] and suppressed the [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Patriarchate]] and Sanhedrin.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===The formula===

The ancient formula for Semikhah was ‘Yoreh Yoreh. Yaddin Yaddin’ (‘May he decide? He may decide! May he judge? He may judge!’); and in the early days of rabbinical Judaism any ordained teacher could ordain his students.

===The unbroken chain of Torah===
Classical semikhah was granted by a court of three judges (Mishnah Sanhedrin 2a), and it later required the participation of at least one who had attained this status, himself. According to Rambam (hil. Sanherin 4:3) the other two need not be semukhim. Semikhah represents an unbroken chain of tradition and authority dating back to the time of Moshe and Yehoshua.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ou.org/public_affairs/article/diaspora_israel_relationsa_study_in_halakha_and_contemporary_issues/&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Hashem taught the [[Torah]] to [[Moshe Rabbeinu]] on Mt. Sinai in 1312 BCE and that since that time, the knowledge of Torah has been passed from generation to generation by the conferment of semikhah, rabbinic ordination, or the unbroken transmission of authority dating back to the time of Moshe. This unbroken chain of tradition is believed by many to have continued for over 3,300 years and continues to this day.&lt;ref name="pidyon.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="simpletoremember.com" /&gt;

===Types===

The Talmud lists three classes of ''semikhah'' issued:&lt;ref name=sanh5a /&gt;
;''Yoreh Yoreh'':The recipient of this ''semikhah'' demonstrated sufficient education and proper judgment to be able to render ''[[halakha|halakhic]]'' judgments on matters of religious law as it pertains to daily life such as ''[[kosher|kashrut]]'', ''[[niddah|nidda]]'', and permissible or forbidden activities on [[Shabbat|Shabbos]] or [[Jewish holiday|Yom Tov]].
;''Yadin Yadin'':The recipient of this ''semikhah'' demonstrated sufficient education and proper judgment to be able to render ''[[halakha|halakhic]]'' judgments on matters of religious law as it pertains to monetary and property disputes.
;''Yatir Bechorot Yatir'':The recipient of this ''semikhah'' demonstrated sufficient education and proper judgment to determine the ritual status of firstborn animals that have developed a blemish.  This degree required extensive veterinary knowledge.

While the first two classes are still issued today, the last one is not.

==Post-Talmudic==

===The decline of classical ''semikhah''===

The original line of succession seems to have died out in the 4th or 5th centuries.  The [[Geonim]], early medieval Jewish sages of Babylon, did not possess semikhah, and did not use the title "rabbi". They were formally known as "rav" and were entrusted with authority to make legal and religious decisions.

Some believe that classical semikhah may have even survived until the 12th century when semuchim from Lebanon and Syria were traveling to Israel in order to pass on semicha to their students.&lt;ref name="daat.ac.il"/&gt;

Sometime after the [[Black Death]] struck Europe, the Jewish community was influenced by the formal issuing of diplomas conferred by European Christian universities. In the areas today known as [[France]] and [[Germany]], [[Ashkenazi Jews]] began using the term ''semikhah'' again, this time using it to refer to a formal "diploma" conferred by a teacher on his pupil, entitling the pupil to be called ''Mori'' (my teacher). This practice was at first frowned upon by [[Sephardi Jews]],{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} who viewed the practice as "presumptuous and arrogant",{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} and an imitation of [[gentile]] customs (in this case, the university doctorate); eventually however this practice was adopted by the Sephardic Jewish community as well.

===Attempts to revive classical semikhah===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Sanhedrin]] --&gt;

[[Maimonides]], in his [[Mishneh Torah]], rules that "if all the sages In Israel would unanimously agree to appoint and ordain judges, then these new ordinants would possess the full authority of the original ordained judges" (Hilchoth Sanhedrin 4:11). His code of law was accepted as normative by the majority of Jewish scholars since that time, though this section was mainly viewed as theoretical, especially because he concludes that "the matter needs deciding". The Sanhedrin of Rabbi Jacob Berab purported to enact this into practical [[halakha|law]], changing minor details. However, since the legal existence of this Sanhedrin depends on the validity of Maimonides' view, the question is circular.

====Attempt by Rabbi Jacob Berab, 1538====

In 1538 Rabbi [[Jacob Berab]] of [[Safed]], [[Land of Israel]], attempted to restore the traditional form of Semikhah. His goal was to unify the scattered Jewish communities through the re-establishment of the [[Sanhedrin]]. At his prompting, 25 rabbis from the land of Israel convened; they ordained Jacob Berab as their "[[chief rabbi]]". Berab then conferred semikhah through a laying on of hands to four rabbis, including [[Joseph Karo]], who was later to become the author of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'', widely viewed as the most important code of Jewish law from the 17th century onwards.

In 1541, Karo succeeded Berab and he perpetuated the tradition by ordaining [[Moshe Alshich]], [[Elisha Gallico]] and [[Jacob Berab II]]. In the 1590s, Alshich ordained [[Hayyim Vital]], and between the years 1594 and 1599, [[Jacob Berab II]] ordained seven more scholars: [[Moses Galante]], [[Elazar ben Moshe Azikri|Elazar Azikri]], [[Moses Berab]] (Jacob's brother), [[Abraham Gabriel]], [[Yom Tov Tzahalon]], [[Hiyya Rofe]] and [[Jacob Abulafia]].&lt;ref name="Fine2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence Fine|title=Physician of the soul, healer of the cosmos: Isaac Luria and his kabbalistic fellowship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B2o8vqvrQOcC&amp;pg=PA52|accessdate=19 September 2011|year=2003|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4826-1|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berab made an error in not first obtaining the approval of the chief rabbis in [[Jerusalem]], which led to an objection to having a Sanhedrin at that time. This was not an objection to the semikhah, but to reinstituting a Sanhedrin. [[Levi Ibn Chaviv|Levi ibn Habib]], the chief rabbi in Jerusalem, wrote that when the nascent Sanhedrin took the authority of a Sanhedrin upon itself, it had to fix the calendar immediately. However, by delaying in this matter, it invalidated itself. Rabbi [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra|David ibn abi Zimra]] (''Radvaz'') of [[Egypt]] was consulted, but when Berab died in 1542 the renewed form of semikhah gradually ground to a halt.

====Attempt by Rabbi Yisroel Shklover, 1830====

In the 1830s, Rav [[Yisroel of Shklov]], one of the leading disciples of the [[Vilna Gaon]] who had settled in Jerusalem, made another attempt to restart semikhah. Rav Yisroel was interested in organizing a [[Sanhedrin]], but he accepted the ruling of [[Levi Ibn Chaviv|Levi ibn Habib]] and [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra|David ibn abi Zimra]] that we cannot create semikhah by ourselves.

At the time the Turkish Empire was crumbling, and losing wars against Russia, Prussia, Austria and others.  In attempt to modernize, the Turkish Empire opened itself up to more and more Western "advisors".  For the first time the Arabian Peninsula and the Yemen was opened up to westerners.  Scientists and Sociologists were convinced that in the Yemen lay communities that had been cut off and isolated from the western world for centuries.  At the time, leading European scientific journals seriously considered that the remnants of the "[[Ten Tribes]]" would actually be found in the Yemen.

Rav Yisroel of Shklov, influenced both by this rush of scientific thought and interested in utilizing a suggestion of the Radvaz of receiving semikhah from one of the "[[Ten Tribes]]", specifically Reuven and Gad. Rav Yisroel charted out where he thought the Bnei Reuven were probably located, and sent an emissary, Rav Pinchas Baruch, to locate them (Sefer Halikutim to the Shabsei Frankel edition of Rambam, Hilchos Sanhedrin 4:11). Unfortunately, Rav Baruch did not succeed in locating the shevet of Reuven and he was either killed or died while attending to the medical needs of poor Yemenite villagers.

An interesting point of Jewish Law arises in that Rav Yisroel raised the question how could the Tribe of Reuven have kept the semikhah alive, since they were outside the Land of Israel and the semikhah can be granted only in Land of Israel. He answered that since the Bnei Reuven had been distant from the rest of Klal Yisroel before this ruling had been accepted, there is no reason to assume that they accepted this ruling, and there was a chance that they were still keeping the institution of semikhah alive.

====Attempt by Rabbi Aharon Mendel haCohen, 1901====

Rabbi Mendel collected the approval of approximately 500 leading Rabbis in favor of the renewal of Semikhah according to the view of [[Maimonides]].  His involvement in the founding of [[World Agudath Israel|Agudath Israel]] and the intervening of [[World War I]] distracted him from implementing this plan.

====Attempt by Rabbi Zvi Kovsker, 1940====
Rabbi [[Zvi Kovsker]] came to the Holy Land from Soviet Russia.  Seeing the condition of Jews in the years leading up to [[World War II]], he undertook an effort to contact and work with many Rabbinic leaders in the Holy Land towards getting their approval for the renewal of Semikhah, and the reestablishment of a Sanhedrin, as an authentic government for the Jewish people (this was before the establishment of the State of Israel).

====Attempt by Rabbi Yehudah Leib Maimon, 1949====

In 1948, with the establishment of the modern [[State of Israel]], the idea of  restoring the traditional form of ''semikhah'' and reestablishing a new "[[Sanhedrin]]" became popular among some within the [[Religious Zionism|religious Zionist]] community. Rabbi [[Yehuda Leib Maimon]], Israel's first minister of religious affairs, promoted this idea in a series of articles in the Religious Zionist periodicals "Sinai" and "Hatzofeh," later gathered together in monograph form as "Renewing the Sanhedrin in our New State." A small number of religious Zionist rabbis of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]'s [[Rabbinical Council of America]] voiced support for this idea; some rabbis within [[Conservative Judaism]] entertained the idea as a potentially positive development. However, most secular Jews, most [[Haredi]]m, and most non-Orthodox Jews did not approve of this goal. Israel's Chief Ashkenazic rabbi at the time, [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]], was hesitant to support this goal, and the idea eventually died away.

====Attempt in Israel in 2004====
{{Main| Modern attempts to revive the Sanhedrin}}
On October 13, 2004, orthodox rabbis of various streams met as a group in [[Tiberias]] and declared themselves to be a re-established Sanhedrin.  The basis for re-establishing semikhah had been made by Rabbi [[Jacob Berab]]'s Sanhedrin, as recorded by Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]] (author of [[Shulchan Aruch]]). An election was held, as required by halakha. Seven hundred rabbis were reached either in person or by writing, and Rabbi [[Moshe Halberstam]] of the [[Edah Charedis]] was the first to receive semikhah after Rabbis [[Ovadiah Yosef]] and [[Yosef Shalom Eliashiv]] found him fit, although he was too old to actually serve as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|judge]].  He then ordained Rabbi [[Dov Levanoni]], who ordained more rabbis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=102678 |title=Rav Moshe Halberstam, First to Renew Semikha, Dies at 74 |publisher=Israel National News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This attempt was intended to improve upon Rabbi [[Jacob Berab]]'s attempt by contacting seven hundred rabbis across Israel, as opposed to [[Jacob Berab]]'s election by twenty-five rabbis of [[Safed]].  The current members mostly behave as place holders and have publicly expressed their intention to step aside when more worthy candidates join.  Rabbi [[Adin Steinsaltz]] the [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]] of the Sanhedrin said, &lt;cite&gt;I'd be happy if in another few years these chairs are filled by scholars who are greater than us [sic] and we can say: `I kept the chairs warm for you.'&lt;cite&gt; [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/objects/pages/PrintArticleEn.jhtml?itemNo=641039]

The current attempt to re-establish the Sanhedrin is the sixth in recent history.

==Status of current rabbis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
Although presently most functioning [[synagogue]] (i.e. "[[pulpit]]") rabbis hold ''semikhah'', this was until quite recently not always required, and in fact many [[Haredi]] rabbis may possibly not be required to hold a "formal" ''semikhah'' even though they may occupy important rabbinical and leadership positions. The reasons being that what is prized in the communities they serve and lead is most of all a supreme mastery of the [[Talmud]] with a vast knowledge of the commentaries of the [[Rishonim]] and [[Acharonim]] and [[Responsa]], added to knowledge of the [[Shulchan Aruch]] and [[Halakha]] ("Jewish Law"). Many [[Hasidic]] [[rebbe]]s and [[Rosh yeshiva]]s of major Orthodox [[yeshivas]] are not required to "prove" to their flocks that they do or do not hold formal ''semikhah'' because their reputations as Torah-scholars and sages is unquestioned and esteemed based on the recommendations of trusted sages, and the experiences and interactions that many knowledgeable Torah-observant Jews have with them, which thus gives practical testimony based on experience that these great rabbis are indeed worthy to be called as such. For example, Rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]], also known as the ''Chafetz Chayim'', probably one of the most famous rabbis of the early 20th century, was trained and recognized as a rabbi, but did not hold ''semikhah'' until he had to apply for a [[passport]]. He realized that unless he obtained a written document of ''semikhah'', he could not technically enter "rabbi" as an [[profession|occupation]] without lying. He then received his ''semikhah'' by [[telegraph]] from Rabbi [[Chaim Ozer Grodzinski]] of [[Wilna]], an unusual arrangement - especially in the early 20th century.

Most current [[posek|poskim]], however, do have semikhah. Just as a debate exists about who is a Jew, there is little consensus as to who is a rabbi. The Reform movement in a Responsa states that for their Temples, pulpit rabbis need to attend and complete their academic program at the Reform movement's Rabbinic schools. But they further state that this does not negate other sects of Judaism from accepting the time-honored semikhah of one-on-one. Nor do they deal with the issue of rabbis who are not pulpit rabbis but teach, study, and do research. They do say that the need for three rabbis is unneeded as the two additional rabbis are just witnesses and cannot attest to the new rabbi's knowledge.

In the UK, a communal minister who does not have semikhah has the title "Reverend" rather than "Rabbi".

== Rav Muvhak ==
The term Rav Muvhak (Hebrew: רב מובהק, alternative pronunciation: Rebbe Muvhak, Movhok, Movhak) refers to the person who taught a student rabbi "most of his knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dafyomi.co.il/bmetzia/halachah/bm-hl-033.htm - Bava Metzia, daf 33, sourced to R'Meir&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''Muvhak'' could be understood as "principal", or "primary". Typical usage is to state that a particular student-Rabbi's ''Rav Muvhak'' is ''Rabbi A'' but the student-Rabbi ''also'' studied (or received ''Semikhah'') from ''Rabbi B''. Rabo (Hebrew: רבו, alternative pronunciation: Ravo) means ''his'' Rav/Rebbe/Rabbi, hence the term Rabo Muvhak, i.e. "his Principal Rabbi".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ateret.org.il/uploads/filebank/pdfeng_0224_OntheAir78.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Special honour must be given to a Rav Muvhak.&lt;ref name="daat.co.il"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://daat.co.il/daat/english/ten-daat/bleich2-1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918133426/http://www.daat.co.il/daat/english/ten-daat/bleich2-1.htm |archivedate=2008-09-18 |df= }} ''Rav Muvhak'' - Rabbi Moshe Bleich, Journal of Jewish Education, Sivan 5758&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times most student rabbis are educated by a number of different rabbis. Therefore the term ''Rav Muvhak'' is now uncommon.&lt;ref name="daat.co.il"/&gt;

==Ordination of cantors==
In the US, some institutions "ordain" cantors (i.e. grant them {{lang|he-Latn|semikhah}}), while others "invest" them. The term "investiture" was originally intended to make a distinction between the ordination of rabbis and that of cantors. However, in response to the increased responsibility of the cantor in contemporary American synagogues, some institutions such as [[Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion|Hebrew Union College]] ([[Reform Judaism|Reform]]) have recently begun to use the term "ordination" instead of "investiture."&lt;ref name="jta.org" /&gt; Other institutions that ordain cantors include [[Hebrew College]] (pluralistic), the [[Academy for Jewish Religion (New York)|Academy for Jewish Religion]] (pluralistic), and [[Jewish Renewal#Post-1993: ALEPH|Aleph]] ([[Jewish Renewal|Renewal]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://hebrewcollege.edu/cantorial&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ajrsem.org/programs/cantreqmnts/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://aleph.org/cantorial-program&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] ([[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]]) currently invests its cantors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jtsa.edu/H_L_Miller_Cantorial_School_and_College_of_Jewish_Music/The_Cantorial_Program.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507164019/http://www.jtsa.edu/H_L_Miller_Cantorial_School_and_College_of_Jewish_Music/The_Cantorial_Program.xml |archivedate=2015-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Summers v. Tice''''', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/33C2d80.htm 33 Cal.2d 80, 199 P.2d 1] (1948), is a seminal [[California Supreme Court]] [[tort]] [[law]] decision relating to the issue of liability where a [[plaintiff]] cannot identify with specificity which among multiple [[defendant]]s caused his harm.  The case established the doctrine of [[alternative liability]] and has had its greatest influence in the area of [[product liability]] in [[United States|American]] jurisprudence.

==Background==
In ''Summers'' the plaintiff, Charles A. Summers, accompanied defendants Tice and Simonson as a guide on a [[quail]] [[Hunting|hunt]] on November 20, 1945. Each of the defendants was armed with a [[Gauge (bore diameter)|12 gauge]] [[shotgun]] loaded with [[Shotgun shell|shells]] containing 7{{frac|1|2}} size shot. Prior to going [[hunting]] plaintiff discussed the hunting procedure with defendants, indicating that they were to exercise care when shooting and to "keep in line." Plaintiff advanced ahead of the defendants up a [[hill]], creating a [[triangle]] among the three men, with plaintiff front and center.  The view of both defendants with respect to Summers was unobstructed, and both defendants knew his location, 75 yards from each of them.  A quail flew to a 10-foot elevation above the plaintiff's head (approximately four feet higher than the plaintiff's head), both defendants shot at the quail, and [[Shotgun shell#Birdshot|bird shot]] struck plaintiff in his right [[human eye|eye]] and another in his upper [[lip]].

Plaintiff sued both defendants for personal injuries. At trial it was established that each of two pellets had caused the injuries to plaintiff's lip and eye, respectively, and both might have been discharged from a single weapon (defendant) or each defendant may have contributed one of the injuring pellets.  The trial court found that the defendants were [[negligent]]  (i.e., that when they discharged their weapons they did not do so with ordinary prudence), and that the plaintiff was not contributorily negligent. The defendants appealed.

==California Supreme Court ruling==
On appeal the defendants argued that they were not joint tortfeasors because they were not acting in concert.   On the subject of negligence, defendant Simonson contended that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the finding on that score. The court ruled that Simonson did not however point out wherein the plaintiff's evidence was lacking.   Defendant Tice on the other hand stated in his opening brief that  "we have decided not to argue the insufficiency of negligence on the part of defendant Tice."  The court noted that Tice neither conceded the point nor argued it in his petition for a hearing before the court and the court therefore did not address that issue further.   Accordingly,  in their view,  neither was liable,  and they could not be held jointly and severally liable  (i.e.,  each defendant was liable for the full amount of damages).

The court affirmed the lower court ruling that each defendant’s behavior fell below the standard of care  (i.e., they were both negligent)  and that the plaintiff's conduct did not contribute to his injury.  Laying out the groundbreaking doctrine of [[alternative liability]], because both defendants had been negligent, the court then decided that justice required that the burden of proving which of the defendants had caused either or both of plaintiff’s injuries be shifted to the defendants,  so that either could absolve himself of liability if possible.  This is because it would have been impossible for the plaintiff to show which of the two negligent actors had caused his harm.  ''Summers v. Tice'' has had enormous precedential impact within the  [[U.S. state|state]]  of California and persuasive authority in other jurisdictions in the area of product liability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5119">'''Supposititious children''' are fraudulent offspring. These arose when an [[heir]] was required and so a suitable baby might be procured and passed off as genuine. This practice seemed to be a common occurrence in [[Ancient Rome]] was used to claim birthright status to a Roman father's wealth and prestige, as rules were instituted to ensure that the children claimed by the wife were the legitimate children of the husband, or ex-husband, in some cases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Treggiari|first1=Susan|title=Roman Marriage: Iusti Coniuges from the Time of Cicero to the Time of Ulpian|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-814939-5|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This was a common concern in the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]] as there were dealers in supposititious children who would provide them for a fee. Laws were passed to counter this and those found to be illegitimate might be sold into [[slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hSluXBs5_AkC&amp;pg=PA109 |title=Greek bastardy in the classical and Hellenistic periods |author=Daniel Ogden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman inheritance laws==
While Roman wives could own property of their own via the dowry system or inheritance, women had no legal standing to participate in public or political life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Jane F.|title=Being a Roman Citizen|date=1993|publisher=Rutledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-00154-4|pages=82-86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper class of Roman citizen was the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]], and the right to participate in the Roman republic at the highest level was passed down from father to son, making paternity in the upper classes a state matter. Because of this, wealthy Roman families often employed a number of midwives to ensure that no sleight-of-hand occurred during the birthing period, and for a set period of time immediately after the woman gave birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rawson|first1=Beryl|title=Children and Childhood in Roman Italy|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-924034-5|pages=99-100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because a Roman woman could file for a divorce after the edict of [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] and a man could do so much earlier, a divorced woman or a widow had to announce her pregnancy and allow observers if she was to claim the child as an heir of her previous husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grubbs|first1=Judith Evans|title=Women and the Law in the Roman Empire: a Sourcebook on Marriage, Divorce, and Widowhood|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-15240-2|pages=200-204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Western society==
Supposititious children were a concern in [[Western society]] for thousands of years and were different from illegitimate children, who were designated by their paternity. Supposititious children were never the offspring of the father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=H.G.|title=Social Forces in England and America|date=1914|publisher=Harper|location=New York|isbn=978-1-77653-322-0|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is because societies were almost uniformly [[patrilineal]] societies, and the blood link to the father had to be established for the child to lay claim to the inheritance or, at the very least, the paternity could not be in doubt. That fear led to the coining of the term [[cuckold]], borrowing the name of a bird notorious for tricking other birds into raising its chicks as their own.

==In folklore==
Supposititious children appear in myths and legends across many Western countries. In some medieval European countries, fairies were believed to sometimes swap out human children with fairy children so that the human parents unsuspectingly raise the [[fairy]] child as their own. In these legends, there must be a legitimate child present for the fairies to work their tricks on the human parents. These legends played upon the fear medieval men had concerning raising offspring that may not be their own. This was particularly a problem among the upper classes, as older men would marry younger women more frequently in the upper classes.

==In popular culture==
The fear of supposititious children also appears in media in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. With the introduction of DNA tests, men can request a medical procedure to gain incontrovertible truth about a child’s paternity. Due to court-ordered child support payments being levied on biological fathers in the event of separation, the fear of supposititious children has been extended from merely raising the child into the fear of having to financially support a child that does not share a biological link. Some entertainers have capitalized on this phenomenon by televising the results of disputed paternity suits. [[Maury Povich]] made the phrase “You are not the father!” famous on the show which shares his name.

The '''Treaties of Velasco''' were two documents signed at [[Velasco, Texas]] (now [[Surfside Beach, Texas]]) on May 14, 1836, between [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]] of [[Mexico]] and the [[Republic of Texas]], in the aftermath of the [[Battle of San Jacinto]] on April 21, 1836. The signatories were [[List of Presidents of the Republic of Texas|Interim President]] [[David G. Burnet]] for Texas and Santa Anna for Mexico. The treaties were intended, on the part of Texas, to provide a conclusion of hostilities between the two enemies and to offer the first steps toward the official recognition of the breakaway republic's independence. 

Santa Anna signed both a public treaty and a secret treaty, but neither treaty was ratified by the Mexican government because he had signed the documents under coercion, as a prisoner. Mexico claimed Texas was a breakaway province, but it was too weak to attempt another invasion. The documents were not even called "treaties" until so characterized by US President [[James K. Polk]] in his justifications for war some ten years later, as Representative [[Abraham Lincoln]] pointed out in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=020/llcg020.db&amp;recNum=102 A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public treaty==
===Article 1===
General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna agrees that he will not take up arms, nor will he exercise his influence to cause them to be taken up against the people of Texas, during the present war of Independence.

===Article 2===
All hostilities between the Mexican and Texan troops will cease immediately both on land and water.

===Article 3===
The Mexican troops will evacuate the Territory of Texas, passing to the other side of the Rio Grande del Norte.

===Article 4===
The Mexican Army in its retreat shall not take the property of any person without his consent and just indemnification, using only such articles as may be necessary for its subsistence, in cases when the owner may not be present, and remitting to the commander of the army of Texas or to the commissioner to be appointed for the 
adjustment of such matters, an account of the value of the property consumed--the place where taken, and the name of the owner, if it can be ascertained.

===Article 5===
That all private property including cattle, horses, negro slaves or indentured persons of whatever denomination, that may have been captured by any portion of the Mexican army or may have taken refuge in the said army since the commencement of the late invasion, shall be restored to the Commander of the Texian army, or to such other persons as may be appointed by the Government of Texas to receive them.

===Article 6===
The troops of both armies will refrain from coming into contact with each other, and to this end the Commander of the army of Texas will be careful not to approach within a shorter distance of the Mexican army than five leagues.

===Article 7===
The Mexican army shall not make any other delay on its march, than that which is necessary to take up their hospitals, baggage [---] and to cross the rivers--any delay not necessary to these purposes to be considered an infraction of this agreement.

===Article 8===
By express to be immediately dispatched, this agreement shall be sent to General Filisola and to General T. J. Rusk, commander of the texian Army, in order that they may be apprised of its stipulations, and to this and they will exchange engagements to comply with the same.

===Article 9===
That all Texan prisoners now in possession of the Mexican Army or its authorities be forthwith released and furnished with free passports to return to their homes, in consideration of which a corresponding number of Mexican prisoners, rank, and file, now in possession of the Government of Texas shall be immediately released. The remainder of the mexican prisoners that continue in possession of the Government of Texas to be treated with due humanity -- any extraordinary comforts that may be furnished them to be at the charge of the Government of Mexico.

===Article 10===
General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna will be sent to Veracruz as soon as it shall be deemed proper.

==Nonratification by Mexico==
Although Gen. [[Vicente Filisola]] began troop withdrawals on May 26, the government of [[President of Mexico|President]] [[José Justo Corro]] in Mexico City resolved, on May 20, to disassociate itself from all undertakings entered into by Santa Anna while he was held captive. Mexico's position was that Santa Anna had no legal standing in the Mexican government to agree to those terms or negotiate a treaty;

Santa Anna's position was that he had signed the documents under coercion as a prisoner, not as a surrendering general in accordance with the laws of war. In fact, he had no authority under the Mexican Constitution to make a treaty, and in any case, the treaties were never ratified by the Mexican government.

==Noncompliance by Texas==
Santa Anna was not given passage to Veracruz. He was kept as a prisoner of war ("clapped in irons for six months", he later claimed) in [[Velasco, Texas|Velasco]] and, later, in the [[Brazoria County, Texas|Orozimbo plantation]], before being taken to [[Washington, D.C.]], in the [[United States]] to meet with President [[Andrew Jackson]] (ostensibly to negotiate a lasting peace between Mexico and Texas, with the USA acting as mediator). Sailing on the frigate [[USS Pioneer (1836)|USS ''Pioneer'']], the guest of the [[U.S. Navy]], he did not arrive in Veracruz until February 23, 1837.

==Outcome==
Because the provisions of the public treaty were not met, the terms of the secret agreement were not released until much later. Although a ''[[fait accompli]]'' since mid-1836, neither the independence of Texas nor its later [[Texas Annexation|annexation by the U.S.]] was formally recognized by Mexico until the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which ended the [[Mexican–American War]] that resulted from the annexation and recognized the [[Rio Grande]] (Río Bravo del Norte) as the [[Mexico–United States border]].

The '''Treaty of London''' ({{lang-fr|Traité de Londres}}), often called the '''Second Treaty of [[London]]''' after the [[Treaty of London (1839)|1839 Treaty]], was an international [[treaty]] signed on 11 May 1867. Agreed to in the aftermath of the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and the [[Luxembourg Crisis]], it had wide-reaching consequences for [[Luxembourg]] and for relations between [[Europe]]'s [[Great Powers]].

==Effects==
The immediate effect of the treaty, established in Article I, was the reaffirmation of the [[personal union]] between the [[Netherlands]] and Luxembourg under the [[House of Orange-Nassau]].&lt;ref&gt;Treaty of London, Article I&lt;/ref&gt;  It lasted until 1890, when a woman (Queen Wilhelmina) ascended to the Dutch throne. As at that time the [[Salic law]] was still in effect in Luxembourg, she could not become Grand Duchess of Luxembourg.

It was the older branch of the House of Nassau (Nassau-Weilburg, now called Luxembourg-Nassau) that inherited that dignity, giving Luxembourg its own exclusive dynasty.  

The Luxembourg Crisis had erupted after [[France|French]] [[Napoleon III of France|Emperor Napoleon III]] attempted to buy Luxembourg from the Dutch [[William III of the Netherlands|King William III]].  Consequently, maintaining Dutch dominance over the [[de jure]] independent Luxembourg, free from French interference, was of paramount importance to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]].

The [[neutral country|neutrality]] of Luxembourg, established by the [[Treaty of London (1839)|First Treaty of London]], was also reaffirmed. The parties that did not sign the earlier treaty were to become [[Guarantee (international law)|guarantors]] of Luxembourg's neutrality (an exception was [[Belgium]], which was, itself, bound to neutrality).&lt;ref&gt;Treaty of London, Article II&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure Luxembourg's neutrality, the (westward) fortifications of [[Luxembourg City]], known as the "[[Gibraltar of the North]]", were to be demolished and never to be rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;Treaty of London, Article V&lt;/ref&gt; To the east, the city was protected by a deep river valley and medieval fortifications that still exist. Dismantling the westward and underground fortifications took sixteen years at a cost of 1.5 million gold [[French franc|francs]] and required the destruction of over {{convert|24|km|mi|abbr=on}} of underground defences and {{convert|4|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of [[casemate]]s, [[Artillery battery|batteries]], [[barracks]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/699.pdf World Heritage List - Luxembourg]. UNESCO, 1 October 1993.  Retrieved on 2 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The still very large residual fortifications of Luxembourg City are now part of the World Heritage List of the UNESCO.

Furthermore, the Prussian [[garrison]], which had been sited in Luxembourg since 1815 in accordance with the decisions of the [[Congress of Vienna]], was to be withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;Treaty of London, Article IV&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Austro-Prussian War]] had led to the collapse of the [[German Confederation]].  Two former members, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the [[Duchy of Limburg (1839-1867)|Duchy of Limburg]], had the Dutch king as their head of state (as ''Grand Duke of Luxembourg'' and ''Duke of Limburg''). To clarify the position in the wake of the death of the Confederation further, the Treaty of London affirmed the end of the Confederation and stated that Limburg was henceforth to be considered with all its "territories" an "integral part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands".&lt;ref&gt;Treaty of London, Article VI&lt;/ref&gt;  

The independent Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, still linked to the Netherlands by a [[personal union]], would rejoin the newly re-established German [[customs union]], the ''[[Zollverein]]'', in which it would remain until 1 January 1919, long after the personal union had ended (1890).

==Signatories==
The treaty was signed by representatives of all of the Great Powers of Europe:
* The [[Austrian Empire]], represented by the [[Rudolf Apponyi|Count Rudolf Apponyi]]
* The [[Belgium|Kingdom of Belgium]], represented by [[Sylvain Van de Weyer]]
* The [[Second French Empire|French Empire]], represented by the [[Henri, prince de La Tour d'Auvergne|Prince de La Tour d'Auvergne-Lauraguais]]
* The [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], represented by the [[Vittorio Emanuelle Taparelli|Marquis d'Azeglio]]
* The [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]], represented by [[Victor de Tornaco|Baron de Tornaco]] and [[Emmanuel Servais]]
* The [[Netherlands|Kingdom of the Netherlands]], represented by the [[Bentinck family|Baron Bentinck]]
* The [[Kingdom of Prussia]], represented by the  [[Albert, Count of Bernstorff-Stintenburg|Count Bernstorff-Stintenburg]]
* The [[Russian Empire]], represented by [[Philipp von Brunnow|Baron Brunnow]]
* The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], represented by [[Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby]]

[[Italy]] was originally not invited, but [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel II]] persuaded the other kings and emperors to invite his representative.  Italy had little relation to Luxembourg, and the treaty did not directly affect Italy in any appreciable manner.  However, it marked the first occasion on which Italy was invited to partake in an international conference on the basis of being a [[Great Power]], and, therefore, was of symbolic value to the fledgling Italian kingdom.

==Cases==
Attorney Suzanne S. Dickey has explained that TELC student attorneys have "handled cases involving all aspects of environmental law, including air pollution, conservation of natural resources, urban land use and siting of waste facilities."&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne S. Dickey, The Tulane Environmental Law Clinic: A Voice for Louisiana Citizens, La. B.J., Aug./Sept. 2001, http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/articles/Voice%20for%20La%20Citizens.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples appear below.

*'''[[Air pollution]]''': TELC student-attorneys filed a Clean Air Act citizen suit in which the court ruled that a [[St. Bernard Parish]] oil refinery violated the Clean Air Act more than 2600 times.&lt;ref&gt;St. Bernard Citizens for Environmental Quality, Inc. v.

EPA, 472 F.3d 882 (D.C. Cir. 2006), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/Court%20Orders/12-22-06%20South%20Coast%20-%20DC%20Cir.pdf; see also July 8, 2008 Notice of Intent of  the Louisiana Environmental Action Network to file Clean Air Act Citizen Suit Against EPA and the LDEQ Secretary, http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/Notice%20Letters/7-8-08%20Ozone%20FIP%20NOV.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this effort, TELC obtained court orders that 1) vacated an EPA attempt to extend Louisiana's deadline for achieving health protection standards for ozone air pollution in the Baton Rouge Area, and 2) vacated EPA's approval of an inter-pollutant trading plan that would have allowed Louisiana to increase emissions of [[volatile organic compounds]] in return for reductions in oxides of nitrogen ([[NOx]]).&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Environmental Action Network v. EPA, No. 02-60991 (5th Cir. 2004) (noting the Court's earlier remand of an EPA attempt to extend the five parish Baton Rouge nonattainment area's deadline for meeting the health protection standard for ozone air pollution, and noting the Court's earlier vacatur of an EPA attempt to approve a trade-off of increased emissions of volatile organic compounds for decreased emissions of nitrogen oxides in the same area, and vacating EPA's approval of a contingency plan for the area based on historical emission reductions from a facility located outside of the area), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/pdfs/9-08-04%20EPA_extend_5.pdf  For an analysis of the EPA/Louisiana interpollutant trading scheme, see The Sting, How Louisiana's Emission Credit Trading System Dirties the Air, Second Generation Issues ABA Committee Newsletter (May, 2003), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/articles/05-03%20The%20Sting%20-%20La%20Emission%20Trading.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; TELC and LEAN also obtained a court order that required EPA to make a determination that increased the stringency of emission controls in the Baton Rouge area,&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Environmental Action Network v. Whitman, No. 00-879-A (M.D. La., Feb. 27, 2002), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/pdfs/02-27-02_SJ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and obtained statements from EPA and LDEQ admitting that Louisiana was operating a "bank" for [[emissions trading]] that failed to meet minimum Clean Air Act requirements.&lt;ref&gt;See LDEQ acknowledgment of illegalities in emission credit reduction "bank" (Oct. 5, 2000), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/agency/10-5-00_epa_illegal_bank.pdf, EPA response to petition to object to a Borden permit (regarding emission credit trading issues) (Dec. 12, 2000), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/agency/12-22-00_borden.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Water pollution]]''': TELC student attorneys engage in administrative actions to convince LDEQ to implement the Clean Water Act's anti-degradation provisions, including rules to protect streams designated as "outstanding natural resource waters."&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Comments on behalf of the GreenZone Task Force, Louisiana Environmental Action Network, and O'Neil Couvillion to the LDEQ (Feb. 15, 2007), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/Comments/2-15-07_landfill.pdf; LDEQ letter summarizing changes made to a Clean Water Act permit in response to comments (Feb. 26, 2007), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/agency/2-26-07_deq.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; TELC settled a case on behalf of coalition of environmental organizations to require cleanup of mercury leaked from meters used to monitor gas wells near [[Monroe, Louisiana]], where many streams are under mercury advisories.&lt;ref&gt;See Stipulated Judgment, Gulf Restoration Network v.

==Funding==
In addition to funding from [[Tulane University Law School|Tulane Law School]], TELC relies on donations by individuals, families and corporations, foundation grants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/pdfs/acknowl.pdf]{{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attorney-fee recoveries.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Court Order, Holy Cross Neighborhood Association v.

==Controversy==
Many of TELC's cases involve large corporations or issues of community, statewide, or national concern.&lt;ref&gt;TELC publishes its docket at http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/docket.htm&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, TELC's work on behalf of its clients can be controversial.&lt;ref&gt;See Cases and Controversy, Envtl.F., Oct. 6, 2006, at 38, http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/articles/controversy.pdf; see also David Jacobs, Chemical Reaction, Baton Rouge Business Report, (Dec. 15, 2009) http://www.businessreport.com/news/2009/dec/15/chemical-reaction-indt1/&lt;/ref&gt; [[John R.

*'''Shintech &amp; Rule XX Revisions''': Tensions became especially pronounced in the late 1990s when TELC represented St. James Citizens for Jobs and the Environment, Louisiana Environmental Action Network, and others in opposing Shintech, Inc.'s proposal for a [[polyvinyl chloride]] plant in a predominantly African-American and lower income community in [[St. James Parish, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Coyle, Governor v. Students in $700M Plant Case, National Law Journal, Sept.  8, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a petition that TELC and [[Greenpeace]] filed on May 22, 1997, EPA formally objected to a state-issued Clean Air Act permit for that plant on September 10, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Order Partially Granting and Partially Denying Petitions for Objections to Permits, In the Matter of Shintech Inc. and its Affiliates' Polyvinyl Chloride Production Facility, Permit Nos. 2466-VO, 2467-VO, 2468-VO (Sept. 10, 1997), at http://www.epa.gov/region07/programs/artd/air/title5/petitiondb/petitions/shintech_decision1997.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Shintech abandoned its plans for a facility in St. James Parish and built a smaller plant elsewhere in Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E.

[[File:VLC Icon.svg|thumb|Common logo for all VideoLAN projects]]

'''VideoLAN''' is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] (just a project name until 1999) which [[software development|develops software]] for playing video and other media formats. It originally developed two [[computer program|programs]] for media [[streaming media|streaming]], VideoLAN Client (VLC) and VideoLAN Server (VLS), but most of the features of VLS have been incorporated into VLC, with the result renamed [[VLC media player]].

The said VideoLAN project began as a student endeavor at [[École Centrale Paris]] (France), but after releasing the software under the [[free software license|free software]]/[[open source license|open source]] [[GNU General Public License]], the project is now multinational with a development team spanning 40 nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videolan.org/videolan/team/index.html VideoLAN team contact list]&lt;/ref&gt; The project has been completely separated from École Centrale Paris since 2009 when it was constituted as a non-profit organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Free Software and Open Source video streaming solution for every OS! |url=https://www.videolan.org/videolan/ |website=videolan.org |accessdate=12 June 2018 |language=en |quote=Since 2009, the project is completely separated from École Centrale Paris, and is driven by an autonomous non-profit organization.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="open corp"/&gt;

The current President of the VideoLAN non-profit organization is Jean-Baptiste Kempf, who is also one of the project's developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unixmen.com/vlc-player-rocks-and-jean-kempf-talks-about-it/ |title=VLC player rocks, and Jean-Baptiste Kempf talks about it! |work=Unixmen |date=2012-05-14 |accessdate=2015-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==

===VLC===
{{Main|VLC media player}}
'''VLC''' (standing for '''VideoLAN Client''') is a [[porting|portable]] multimedia player, encoder, and streamer supporting many audio and video [[codec]]s and [[file format]]s as well as [[DVD]]s, [[video CD|VCDs]], and various [[streaming media|streaming]] [[communications protocol|protocols]]. It is able to stream over [[computer network|networks]] and to transcode multimedia files and save them into various formats. It is one of the most platform-independent players available, with versions for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Windows Phone]], [[Linux]], [[BeOS]], [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Chrome OS]], and is widely used with over 2.1 billion downloads as of September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.videolan.org/stats/downloads.html | title=Download Statistics | work=VideoLAN Project | accessdate=2017-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===VLMC===
'''[http://www.videolan.org/vlmc/ VLMC]''' (standing for '''VideoLAN Movie Creator''') is a cross-platform, [[non-linear editing system|non-linear]], video editing [[application software|software application]] based on the [[VLC Media Player]]. The software is still in early development.
The latest version is 0.2.0 (released 2014-10-30), released under the GPLv2 license.

===VLS===
The '''VLS''' (standing for '''VideoLAN Server''') project was originally intended to be used as a server for streaming videos. But now, it has been merged with the VLC project and use of VLS is not encouraged.

===Codecs===
The VideoLAN project also hosts several audio/video [[codec|decoding]] and [[encryption|decryption]] [[library (computer science)|libraries]], such as [[libdvdcss]] which allows the content of [[content Scramble System|CSS]] protected [[DVD]]s to be unscrambled, [[x264]] which can encode [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] video, [[x265]] which can encode [[HEVC]] video, [[x262]] which can encode [[MPEG-2]] video, [[libdca]] which can decode [[DTS Coherent Acoustics|DTS]] audio and the [[Git (software)|git]] [[Repository (version control)|repository]] of the [[multimedia framework]] [[FFmpeg]].

===VLMa===
A new project has been developed, called '''[http://www.videolan.org/projects/vlma/ VLMa]''' (standing for '''VideoLAN Manager''').
VLMa is an application to manage broadcasts of TV channels, received through digital terrestrial or satellite ways. Its interface is provided as a web-site written in Java. It is also capable of streaming audio and video files. VLMa consists of a daemon (called VLMad) and a web interface (called VLMaw). VLMa is released under the GNU General Public License like [[VLC media player]].

===VLC media player Skin Editor===
The VLC Skin Editor is a simple program developed by VideoLAN. The simple interface allows users to create new skins for the [[VLC media player]] without knowledge of the VLC Skins2 XML System. The program lets users change features on the main window, playlist window, and equalizer window. The current version is 2.0.8 and can be downloaded on the videolan.org website.

==Commercial use==
In May 2008, [[Neuros Technology]] and [[Texas Instruments]] began work on a port of VideoLAN to their next generation open set-top box.&lt;ref&gt;[http://open.neurostechnology.com/content/vlc-porting-neuros-open-internet-television-hdplatform VLC Port to Neuros Linux] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530234746/http://open.neurostechnology.com/content/vlc-porting-neuros-open-internet-television-hdplatform |date=May 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

VLC is currently used in products through the use of libVLC and also as raw or customized VLC for Android versions on devices.
Some features have been publicly merged such as 360° support &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realite-virtuelle.com/vlc-media-player-videos-360-2911#ftoc-heading] vlc media player videos 360&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to software-bundling==
VideoLAN developers have expressed dismay at how users searching for their products see search advertising from websites that use [[unwanted software bundling]] to modify official download files with wrappers that include [[Malware#Grayware|unwanted programs]].  VideoLAN doesn't have the money to sue the many companies abusing their trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.l0cal.com/2011/07/07/these-companies-that-mislead-our-users/|title=These companies that mislead our users|date=7 Jul 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/news/vlc-media-player-suffering-in-face-of-crapware-and-uncaring-google-1400411/|title=VLC media player suffering in face of crapware and uncaring Google|work=Geek.com|date=7 Jul 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/VideoLAN-Calls-Out-for-Help-to-Protect-Users-from-VLC-Scams-211896.shtml|title=VideoLAN Calls Out for Help to Protect Users from VLC Scams|date=16 Jul 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=86774|title=Adware in new installer|work=The VideoLAN forums}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yes, Every Freeware Download Site is Serving Crapware (Here’s the Proof)|url=http://www.howtogeek.com/207692/yes-every-freeware-download-site-is-serving-crapware-heres-the-proof/|quote=Sadly, even on Google all the top results for most open source and freeware are just ads for really terrible sites that are bundling crapware, adware, and malware on top of the installer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39542">The winner of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] is selected by a [[positional voting system]]. Each country awards two sets of 12, 10, 8–1 points to their 10 favourite songs: one from their professional jury and the other from televoting.&lt;ref name="biggest_change"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jordan|first=Paul|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=biggest_change_to_eurovision_song_contest_voting_since_1975|title=Biggest change to Eurovision Song Contest voting since 1975|publisher=eurovision.tv|accessdate=18 February 2016|date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current system has been in place since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]].

==Overview==
Small, demographically-balanced juries made up of ordinary people had been used to rank the entries, but after the widespread use of telephone voting in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]] the contest organizers resorted to juries only in the event of a televoting malfunctions. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]], [[Eircom]]'s telephone polling system malfunctioned. Irish broadcaster [[RTÉ]] did not receive the polling results from [[Eir (telecommunications)|Eircom]] in time, and substituted votes by a panel of judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/30/russia.arts|title=Vote switch 'stole Tatu's Eurovision win'|last=Nick|first=Paton Walsh|date=2003-05-30|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1997 and 2003 (the first years of televoting), lines were opened to the public for only five minutes after the performance and recap of the final song. Between 2004 and 2006 the lines were opened for 10 minutes, and from 2007 to 2009 they were opened for 15 minutes. In 2010 viewers were allowed to vote during the performances, but this was rescinded for the 2012 contest.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The [[BBC]] contacted regional juries by telephone to choose the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1956|1956]] winners, and the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (producers of the contest) later began contacting international juries by telephone. This method continued to be used until 1993. The following year saw the first satellite linkup to juries.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

To announce the votes, the contest's [[List of Eurovision Song Contest presenters|presenters]] connect by satellite to each country in turn and inviting a spokesperson to read the country's votes in [[French language|French]] or [[English language|English]]. The presenters originally repeated the votes in both languages, but since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]] the votes have been translated due to time constraints. To offset increased voting time required by a larger number of participating countries, since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]] only countries' eight-, 10-, and 12-point scores are read aloud; one- to seven-point votes are added automatically to the scoreboard while each country's spokesperson is introduced. The scoreboard displays the number of points each country has received and, since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]], a progress bar indicating the number of countries which have voted. Since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]], only the 12-point score is read aloud due to the new voting system, meaning that the nine scoring countries were added automatically to the scoreboard (1-8 and 10 points). In addition, the televoting points are combined together and the presenters announce them in order, starting from the country with the lowest score and ending with the country with the highest score from the televoting.

;Note:{{reflist|group=note}}

The most-used voting system (other than the current one) was last used for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1969|1969]] contest. This system was used from 1957 to 1961 and from 1967 to 1969. Ten jurors in each country each cast one vote for their favourite song. In 1969 this resulted in a four-way tie for first place (between the UK, the Netherlands, France, and Spain), with no tie-breaking procedure. A second round of voting in the event of a tie was introduced to this system the following year.

From 1962 to 1966, a voting system similar to the current one was used. In 1962, each country awarded its top three one, two and three points; in 1963 the top five were awarded one, two, three, four and five points, and from 1964 to 1966, each country usually awarded its top three one, three and five points. With the latter system, a country could choose to give points to two countries instead of three (giving three to one and six to the other); in 1965, Belgium awarded the United Kingdom six points and Italy three. Although it was possible to give one country nine points, this never occurred.

The [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971|1971]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972]], and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] contests saw the jurors "in vision" for the first time. Each country was represented by two jurors: one older than 25 and one younger, with at least ten years' difference in their ages. Each juror gave a minimum of one point and a maximum of five points to each song. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974]] the previous system of ten jurors was used, and the following year the current system was introduced. Spokespeople were next seen on screen in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994]] with a satellite link to the venue.

The [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]] contest had its first semifinal, with a slight change in voting: countries which did not qualify from the semifinal would be allowed to cast votes in the final. This resulted in Ukraine's [[Ruslana]] finishing first, with a record 280 points. If the voting had been conducted as it had been from 1956 to 2003 (when only finalist countries could vote), [[Serbia and Montenegro]]'s [[Željko Joksimović]] would have won the contest with 190 points: a 15-point lead over Ruslana, who would have scored 175 points. To date, non-qualifying countries are still allowed to vote in the final. In 2006, Serbia and Montenegro were able to vote in the semifinal and the final despite their non-participation due to a [[Evropesma#2006 event and controversy|scandal in the selection process]].

With the introduction of two semifinals in 2008, a new method of selecting finalists was created. The top nine songs (ranked by televote) qualified, along with one song selected by the back-up juries. This method, in most cases, meant that the tenth song in the televoting failed to qualify; this attracted some criticism, especially from [[Republic of Macedonia|Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]] (who had placed 10th in the televote in both years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14111|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521220118/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14111|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-05-21|title=FYR Macedonia threatens Eurovision withdrawal|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2009-05-20|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=24 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the 2009 final system was used, with a combination of televoting and jury votes from each country also used to select the semi-finalists.&lt;ref name="2010 voting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=4533&amp;_t=Exclusive%3A+Juries+also+get+50%25+stake+in+Semi-Final+result!|title=Exclusive: Juries also get 50% stake in Semi-Final result!|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=2009-10-11|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]''|accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each participating country had a national jury, consisting of five music-industry professionals&lt;ref name=VotingWindow&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Sietse Bakker|Bakker]]|first=[[Sietse Bakker|Sietse]]|title=EBU restores televoting window as from 2012|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=37013&amp;_t=ebu_restores_televoting_window_as_from_2012|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=4 July 2011|date=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; appointed by national broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430201605/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-30 |df= }} read 2015-05-20&lt;/ref&gt;

== Highest scores ==
"[[A Million Voices (song)|A Million Voices]]" sung by Russian artist [[Polina Gagarina]], became the first song to get over 300 points without winning the contest (and the only one during the era when each country delivered only one set of points); with a new voting system introduced in 2016, Australia became the first country to get over 500 points without winning the contest. In 2017, Bulgaria became the first non-winning entry to score above 600 points, as well as Portugal becoming the first country to get over 750 points - winning the contest as a result of this. As the number of voting countries and the voting systems have varied, it may be more relevant to compare what percentage of all points awarded in the competition that each song received (computed from the published scoreboards [http://www.eurovision.tv/page/results] [http://eurovisionworld.com/?eurovision=2017].

==Tie-breakers==
A [[tie-break]] procedure was implemented after the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1969|1969 contest]], in which [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|France]], the [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest|Netherlands]], [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|United Kingdom]] tied for first place. With no tie-breaking system in place at the time, it was determined that all four countries would be awarded the title; in protest, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Portugal did not participate the following year.

In the procedure, sometimes known as a [[Issues affecting the single transferable vote#Countback|countback]], if two (or more) countries tie, the song receiving points from the greater number of countries is the winner. If there is still a tie, a second tie-breaker counts the number of countries who assigned twelve points to each entry in the tie. Tie-breaks continue with ten points, eight points, and so on until the tie is resolved. If the tie cannot be resolved after the number of countries which assigned one point to the song is equal, the song performed earlier in the running order is declared the winner unless the host country performed earlier (in which case the song performed later would be the winner). This rule originally applied only to first place ties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf|title=Public rules of the 60th Eurovision Song Contest|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=1 June 2015|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430201605/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf|archivedate=30 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but since 2008 has been applied to all places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=1469 |work=Eurovision.tv |title=Eurovision 2008 Final |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]], the tie-break procedure was implemented when [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Sweden]] and France both had 146 points at the end of the voting. At the time, the tie-break rule was slightly different; the first tie-break rule was not yet in use, and the current rule of first determining the country with the votes from the most countries was not added until [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myledbury.co.uk/eurovision/pdf/esc2002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myledbury.co.uk/eurovision/pdf/esc2003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Both Sweden and France had received the maximum twelve points four times; when the number of ten-point scores was counted Sweden, represented by [[Carola Häggkvist|Carola]] and "[[Fångad av en stormvind]]", claimed its third victory since it received five ten-point scores against France's two. The French song "[[Le Dernier qui a parlé...]]", performed by [[Amina Annabi|Amina]], finished second with the smallest-ever losing margin.

==Scoring no points==
[[File:Eurovision nul points map.svg|thumb|right|400px|alt=Colour-coded map|Countries with no points, and the number of times for each]]
As each participating country casts a series of preference votes, under the current scoring system it is rare that a song fails to receive any votes at all; such a result means that the song failed to make the top ten most popular songs in any country.

The first zero points in Eurovision were scored in 1962, under a new voting system. When a country finishes with a score of zero, it is often referred to in English-language media as ''nul points'' or ''nil points'', albeit incorrectly. Grammatical French for "no points" is ''pas de points'' or ''zéro point'', but none of these phrases are used in the contest; before 2016's voting overhaul, no-point scores were not announced by the presenters. Following the change in the voting system, a country receiving no points from the public voting is announced as receiving "zero points". {{citation needed|August=2016|date=August 2016}}

The first time a host nation ever finished with ''nul points'' was in the 2015 final, when Austria's "I Am Yours" by The Makemakes scored zero. In 2003, following the UK's first zero score,&lt;ref name="uk2003"/&gt; an online poll was held to determine public opinion about each zero-point entry's worthiness of the score. Spain's "¿Quién maneja mi barca?" (1983) won the poll as the song that least deserved a zero, and Austria's "Lisa Mona Lisa" (1988) was the song most deserving of a zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sechuk.com/TheBigZeroResult.htm|title=The BIG Zero|work=sechuk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, although it scored in the combined voting, [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|France]]'s "[[Echo (You and I)]]" by [[Anggun]] would have received no points if televoting alone had been used. In that year's first semi-final, although [[Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest|Belgium]]'s "[[Would You?

===2016 onwards: One section of voting===
With the new televoting system being introduced in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]] contest, scoring no points in either the jury voting or televoting phase is possible. An overall "nul points" is possible, but much less likely, and has not yet happened.

In 2016, the Czech Republic's entry "[[I Stand (song)|I Stand]]" received no points from the televote. They did get 41 points from juries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/voting/ESC-2016-grand_final-full_results.xls |title=ESC 2016 grand final full results |accessdate=15 May 2016 |publisher=Eurovision |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515141453/https://www.eurovision.tv/upload/voting/ESC-2016-grand_final-full_results.xls |archivedate=15 May 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2017, Spain's entry "[[Do It for Your Lover]]" received no points from the juries. They did get 5 points from the televote. Also in 2017, Austria's entry "[[Running on Air (song)|Running on Air]]" received no points from the televote but they did get 93 points from juries.

No entry in the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest]] has ever received ''nul points''; between 2005 and 2015, each contestant begins with 12 points to prevent such a result.&lt;ref name="12p"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=''ESC Today'' |date=26 November 2005 |url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/5208 |title='Your votes please: the spokespersons' |accessdate=10 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601191146/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/5208 |archivedate=1 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has not been a situation that the 12 points received in the beginning would have remained as the sole points.{{citation needed|August=2016|date=August 2016}} On 15 October 2012, it was announced by the EBU, that for the first time in the contest's history a new ''"{{Esccnty|Kids Jury|Junior}}"'' was being introduced into the voting system. The jury consists of members aged between 10 and 15, and representing each of the participating countries. A spokesperson from the jury would then announce the points 1-8, 10 and the maximum 12 as decided upon by the jury members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siim|first1=Jarmo|title=Extra 'country' to give points in 2012|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=extra_country_to_give_points_in_2012|website=junioreurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=25 August 2016|date=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2016 Junior Eurovision Song Contest|2016]] the Kids Jury was removed and instead, each country awarded 1-8, 10 and 12 points from both adult and kid's juries, also eliminating televoting from the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jordan|first1=Paul|title=Format changes for the Junior Eurovision 2016|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=format_changes_for_the_junior_eurovision_2016|website=junioreurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=17 May 2016|date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An expert panel were also present at the 2016 contest, with each of the panelists being able to award 1-8, 10 and 12 points themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jordan|first1=Paul|title=Jedward to appear at Junior Eurovision 2016!|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=jedward_to_appear_at_junior_eurovision_2016|website=junioreurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=17 May 2016|date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional bloc voting==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]] --&gt;
Although statistical analysis of the results from 2001 to 2005 suggests regional bloc voting;&lt;ref name="Derek"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Derek Gatherer|title=Comparison of Eurovision Song Contest Simulation with Actual Results Reveals Shifting Patterns of Collusive Voting Alliances.|date=2005-09-20|url=http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/9/2/1.html|accessdate=2007-05-14
}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is debatable whether this is due to political alliances or a tendency for culturally-close countries to have similar musical tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Victor Ginsburgh, Abdul Noury|date=October 2006|title=The Eurovision Song Contest:: Is Voting Political or Cultural?|url=http://164.15.69.62/ecare/personal/ginsburgh/papers/153.eurovision.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom and France would historically exchange points (an average of 6.5 points per contest), and the UK has also had such a relationship with Ireland. Several countries can be categorised as voting blocs, which regularly award one another high points:&lt;ref name="Derek" /&gt;

*Greece and Cyprus
*Turkey and Azerbaijan
*English-speaking countries or countries of the Commonwealth: Australia, Malta, Ireland and United Kingdom
*The former Czechoslovakian countries: Czech Republic and Slovakia
*Austria, Germany and Switzerland
*The Netherlands and Belgium
*Andorra, Portugal and Spain
*The Nordic states: Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland
*The Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania
*Romania and Moldova, acting as a bridge between the Balkan and Warsaw Pact states
*The Balkan countries:
*:Macedonia and Albania
*:The former Yugoslav countries: Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Croatia
*The former [[USSR]] countries of Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia and Moldova
*Hungary and Serbia

It is still common for countries to award points to their neighbours regularly, even if they are not part of a voting bloc (for example, [[Finland]] and [[Estonia]], [[Germany]] and [[Denmark]], the Baltic states and [[Russia]] or [[Albania]] and [[Greece]]). Votes may also be based on a diaspora. [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]] and the former Yugoslav countries normally get high scores from [[Germany]] or the United Kingdom, [[Armenia]] gets votes from [[France]] and [[Belgium]], [[Poland]] from [[Ireland]], [[Romania]] from [[Spain]] and [[Italy]] and [[Albania]] from [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]] and [[San Marino]]. 
Former Eurovision TV director Bjørn Erichsen disagreed with the assertion that regional bloc voting significantly affects the contest's outcome, saying that Russia's first victory in 2008 was only possible with votes from thirty-eight of the participating countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news/belgrade-2008?id=1135|first = Sietse|last = Bakker|title = Eurovision TV Director responds to allegations on voting|accessdate = 23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent study, &lt;ref name="Mantzaris et al"&gt;Mantzaris, Alexander V., Rein, Samuel R. and Hopkins, Alexander D. "[http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/21/1/1.html Examining  Collusion and Voting Biases Between Countries During the Eurovision Song Contest Since 1957.]", ''Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation''  vol. 21, no. 1. 31 Jan 2018. Retrieved 16 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;, a new methodology is presented which allows a complete analysis of the competition from 1957 until 2017. The voting patterns change and the previous studies restrained their analysis to a particular time window where the voting scheme is homogeneous and this approach allows the sampling comparison over arbitrary periods consistent with the unbiased assumption of voting patterns. This methodology also allows for a sliding time window to accumulate a degree of collusion over the years producing a weighted network. The previous results are supported and the changes over time provide insight into the collusive behaviours given more or less choice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2483">The '''Wanfried Agreement''' (German: ''Wanfrieder Abkommen'') concerned a transfer of territory between the U.S. and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|occupation zones]] after [[World War II]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], which took place after the determination of the main [[inner German border]] at the end of July 1945.

In the U.S. zone the [[Bebra–Göttingen railway]] line, which linked with lines to the cities of [[Bremen]], [[Hannover]] and [[Bebra]] cut across a small (~ 3&amp;nbsp;km / 2&amp;nbsp;mi) portion of the Soviet zone near [[Neuseesen]] and [[Werleshausen]] ([[Thuringia]]).  This situation caused disruptions of traffic on the line, which was important to the U.S. as a link between its occupation zone in southern Germany and a small U.S.-controlled [[exclave]] at the port of [[Bremerhaven]] on the [[North Sea]].

On September 17, 1945, an agreement was signed in the town of [[Wanfried]] between the American and Soviet authorities moving the border to resolve the problem.  After the agreement was concluded, the participating officers exchanged flasks of [[whisky]] and [[vodka]], and from then on the railway line was known jokingly in [[German language|German]] as the ''Whisky-Wodka-Linie''.  

[[Brigadier General]] [[William Thaddeus Sexton]], [[U.S. Army]], signed the Wanfried agreement for the United States, while [[Red Army]] [[Major General]] [[Vasili S. Askalepov]] signed for the Soviet Union.

The Hessian villages of [[Asbach-Sickenberg]], [[Vatterode]], and [[Weidenbach, Eichsfeld|Weidenbach]]/[[Hennigerode]] (Kreis Witzenhausen) with 429 inhabitants and 7.61 square kilometres of land fell in Soviet territory.  The [[Eichsfeld]] villages of Neuseesen and Werleshausen with 560 people and 8.45 square kilometres were transferred to the U.S. zone.  

Although other such small exchanges took place afterwards on the inner-German border, only the Wanfried Agreement had the status of a [[treaty]] between the occupying Powers, and is considered to have been on an equal footing with the [[Potsdam Agreement]].
