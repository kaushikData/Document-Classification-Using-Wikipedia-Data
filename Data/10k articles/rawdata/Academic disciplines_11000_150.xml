      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9038">'''5D BIM''', an acronym for 5D [[Building Information Modeling]], is a term used in the [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] and [[construction]] industries, and refers to the intelligent linking of individual [[3D CAD]] components or assemblies with schedule (time - [[4D BIM]]) constraints
&lt;ref name=5DBIM-R-04&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/4D/ |title=Introduction to 4D Research by Martin Fischer |publisher=stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then with cost-related information.&lt;ref name=5DBIM-R-02/&gt;

'''5D =  3D + SCHEDULE + COST'''&lt;ref&gt;THIS IS A BASIC DEFINITION&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of 5D models enables the various participants (from architects, designers, contractors to owners) of a construction project to visualize the progress of construction activities and its related costs over time.&lt;ref name=5DBIM-R-03/&gt;&lt;ref name=5DBIM-R-05/&gt; This BIM-centric project management technique has potential to improve management and delivery of projects of any size or complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Fred. "[http://www.theb1m.com/video/what-is-5d-bim What is 5D BIM?]". www.TheB1M.com. The B1M Limited. Retrieved 8 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, McKinsey, a consultancy, identified 5D BIM technology as one of five big ideas poised to disrupt construction.It defined 5D BIM as "a five-dimensional representation of the physical and functional characteristics of any project. It considers a project’s cost and schedule in addition to the standard spatial design parameters in 3-D." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/capital-projects-and-infrastructure/our-insights/imagining-constructions-digital-future|title=Imagining construction’s digital future|website=McKinsey &amp; Company|language=en|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Usage ==

In Germany and Europe at large, 5D BIM technology is prevalent among large general contractors.

*Assessment - This step involves collecting data pertinent to the patient, including nutrition-related History, anthropometric Measurements, biochemical data, nutrition-focused physical findings, client history and comparative standards.
*Diagnosis - Based on the assessment data collected, a nutrition problem may be diagnosed. Causes and contributing factors are identified. 
*Intervention - Based on the nutrition diagnosis, problems are addressed that aid in alleviation of the diagnosis’ signs and symptoms. Activities are constructed to enable the patient to work towards objectives set for them by themselves and their nutrition professional. 
*Monitoring/Evaluation - Progress made on goals and/or expected outcomes is tracked to ensure that nutrition problems are being addressed; adjustments in the Intervention step are made according to progress.&lt;ref name="Boyle2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marie A.

The '''Amerind Foundation''' is a [[museum]] and research facility dedicated to the preservation and interpretation of [[Amerindian|Native American]] cultures and their histories. Its facilities are located near the village of [[Dragoon, Arizona|Dragoon]] in [[Cochise County, Arizona]], about 65 miles east of [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in [[Texas Canyon]].

[[William Shirley Fulton]] (1880–1964), an archaeologist, established the Amerind Foundation in 1937.

The Amerind Foundation's building was designed by Tucson architect [[Merritt Starkweather]] and contains one of the finest collections of [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[ethnology|ethnological]] artifacts in the country as well as a sizable research library. 

According to the Foundation's literature, "Amerind" is a contraction of the words "[[Native American name controversy|American]]" and "Indian".

==Museum exhibits==
The museum's permanent exhibits include archaeological artifacts from the Amerind property by founder [[William Shirley Fulton]] and later by director [[Charles C. Di Peso]], as well as items found at Di Peso at [[Casas Grandes, Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]] and other excavations.  The objects include weapons, tools, baskets, sandals, cordage of human hair, and cloth.

There are ethnographic items from different indigenous peoples ranging from Alaska to South America. Items on display include jewelry, baskets, weapons, cradle boards, religious artifacts, figurative items, ceramics and pottery, and art.

===Art Gallery===
The Fulton-Hayden Memorial Art Gallery features paintings by 20th century [[Anglo]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] artists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1421">In [[mycology]] a [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] or feature is said to be '''amyloid''' if it has a positive '''amyloid reaction''' when subjected to a crude chemical test using [[iodine]] in either [[Melzer's reagent]] or [[Lugol's solution]], producing a black to blue-black staining. The term "amyloid" is derived from the [[Latin]] ''amyloideus'' ("starch-like").&lt;ref name="Ulloa 2014"/&gt; It refers to the fact that [[starch]] gives a similar reaction, also called an amyloid reaction. The test can either be on microscopic features, such as spore walls or [[hyphae|hyphal]] walls, or the apical apparatus on an [[ascus]], or be a macroscopic reaction on tissue where a drop of the reagent is applied. Negative reactions, called '''inamyloid''' or '''nonamyloid''' reactions are for structures that remain pale brown or clear. A reaction producing a deep reddish to reddish-brown staining is termed either a '''pseudoamyloid''' reaction or a '''dextrinoid''' reaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8297">In [[computer science]], an '''anytime algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] that can return a valid solution to a [[Problem#Problem solving|problem]] even if it is interrupted before it ends. The algorithm is expected to find better and better solutions the longer it keeps running.

Most algorithms run to completion: they provide a single answer after performing some fixed amount of computation. In some cases, however, the user may wish to terminate the algorithm prior to completion. The amount of computation required may be substantial, for example, and computational resources might need to be reallocated. Most algorithms either run to completion or they provide no useful solution information. Anytime algorithms, however, are able to return a partial answer, whose quality depends on the amount of computation they were able to perform. The answer generated by anytime algorithms is an approximation of the correct answer.

==Names==
An anytime algorithm may be also called an "interruptible algorithm". They are different from contract algorithms, which must declare a time in advance; in an anytime algorithm, a process can just announce that it is terminating.&lt;ref name="Hendler"&gt;Hendler, James A., ''Artificial Intelligence Planning Systems'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals ==
The goal of anytime algorithms are to give [[Hybrid intelligent system|intelligent systems]] the ability to make results of better quality in return for turn-around time.&lt;ref name="Zilberstein"&gt;Zilberstein, Shlomo. "Using Anytime Algorithms in Intelligent Systems". http://rbr.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/papers/Zaimag96.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They are also supposed to be flexible in time and resources.&lt;ref name="Grass"&gt;Grass, Joshua.  "Reasoning about [[Computational resource|Computational Resource]] Allocation." http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds3-1/racra.html&lt;/ref&gt; They are important because [[artificial intelligence]] or AI algorithms can take a long time to complete results. This algorithm is designed to complete in a shorter amount of time.&lt;ref name="Grass"/&gt; Also, these are intended to have a better understanding that the system is dependent and restricted to its agents and how they work cooperatively.&lt;ref name="Grass"/&gt; An example is the [[Newton-Raphson]] iteration applied to finding the square root of a number.&lt;ref name="FOLDOC"&gt;[http://foldoc.org/anytime+algorithm anytime algorithm from Free Online Dictionary of Computing (FOLDOC)]&lt;/ref&gt; Another example that uses anytime algorithms is trajectory problems when you're aiming for a target; the object is moving through space while waiting for the algorithm to finish and even an approximate answer can significantly improve its accuracy if given early.&lt;ref name="Grass"/&gt;

What makes anytime algorithms unique is their ability to return many possible outcomes for any given input.&lt;ref name="Zilberstein"/&gt; An anytime algorithm uses many well defined quality measures to monitor progress in [[problem solving]] and [[distributed computing]] resources.&lt;ref name="Zilberstein"/&gt; It keeps searching for the best possible answer with the amount of time that it is given.&lt;ref name="umich"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anytime algorithms|url=http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/cogarch2/index.html|website=Cognitive architectures|publisher=University of Michigan Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213011435/http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/cogarch2/cap/anytime.plan|archivedate=13 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may not run until completion and may improve the answer if it is allowed to run longer.&lt;ref name="elook"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anytime algorithm - Computing Reference|url=http://www.elook.org/computing/anytime-algorithm.htm|website=eLook.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212094200/http://www.elook.org/computing/anytime-algorithm.htm|archivedate=12 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is often used for large decision set problems.&lt;ref name="Horsch"/&gt; This would generally not provide useful information unless it is allowed to finish.&lt;ref name="Bender"&gt;Bender, Edward A. ''Mathematical Methods In Artificial Intelligence'', [[IEEE Computer Society]] Pres, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; While this may sound similar to [[dynamic programming]], the difference is that it is fine-tuned through random adjustments, rather than sequential.

Anytime algorithms are designed so that it can be told to stop at any time and would return the best result it has found so far.&lt;ref name="Grass"/&gt; This is why it is called an interruptible algorithm. Anytime algorithms also maintain the last result, so that if they are given more time, they can continue from where they left off to obtain an even better result.&lt;ref name="Grass"/&gt;

== Decision trees ==
When the decider has to act, there must be some ambiguity. Also, there must be some idea about how to solve this ambiguity. This idea must be translatable to a state to action diagram.&lt;ref name="Horsch"&gt;Horsch, Michael C., Poole, David "An Anytime Algorithm for Decision Making under Uncertainty" http://www.cs.ubc.ca/spider/poole/papers/randaccref.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance profile ==
The performance profile estimates the quality of the results based on the input and the amount of time that is allotted to the algorithm.&lt;ref name="Grass"/&gt; The better the estimate, the sooner the result would be found.&lt;ref name="Grass"/&gt; Some systems have a larger database that gives the probability that the output is the expected output.&lt;ref name="Grass"/&gt; It is important to note that one algorithm can have several performance profiles.&lt;ref name="Teije"&gt;Teije, Annette ten, Harmelen, Frank. "Describing Problem Solving Methods using Anytime Performance Profiles".&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the time performance profiles are constructed using [[mathematical statistics]] using representative cases. For example, in the [[Travelling salesman problem|traveling salesman]] problem, the performance profile was generated using a user-defined special program to generate the necessary statistics.&lt;ref name="Hendler"/&gt; In this example, the performance profile is the mapping of time to the expected results.&lt;ref name="Hendler"/&gt; This quality can be measured in several ways:

*certainty: where probability of correctness determines quality&lt;ref name="Hendler"/&gt;
*accuracy: where error bound determines quality&lt;ref name="Hendler"/&gt;
*specificity: where the amount of particulars determine quality&lt;ref name="Hendler"/&gt;

==Algorithm prerequisites==
Initial behavior: While some algorithms start with immediate guesses, others take a more calculated approach and have a start up period before making any guesses.&lt;ref name="Teije"/&gt;

*Growth direction: How the quality of the program's "output" or result, varies as a function of the amount of time ("run time")&lt;ref name="Teije"/&gt;
*Growth rate: Amount of increase with each step. Does it change constantly, such as in a [[bubble sort]] or does it change unpredictably?
*End condition: The amount of runtime needed&lt;ref name="Teije"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8300">[[File:Arch Sculpt - CA 09.jpg|thumb|350px|right|sculpted [[pediment]]]]'''Architectural sculpture''' is the use of [[sculpture|sculptural]] techniques by an [[architect]] and/or [[sculptor]] in the design of a building, [[bridge]], [[mausoleum]] or other such project. The sculpture is usually integrated with the structure, but freestanding works that are part of the original design are also considered to be architectural sculpture.

It has also been defined as, ''an integral part of a building or sculpture created especially to decorate or embellish an architectural structure.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selectartusa.com/gloss.htm|title=Select Art Sculpture: Glossary|work=selectartusa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architectural sculpture has been employed by builders throughout history, and in virtually every continent on earth save pre-colonial Australia.

==Egyptian==
{{main article|Ancient Egyptian architecture}}
[[File:LuxTempleObelisk.JPG|left|200px|thumb|[[Luxor Obelisk]]]]
Modern understanding of ancient Egyptian architecture is based mainly on the religious monuments that have survived since antiquity, which are carved stone with post-and-lintel construction. These religious monuments dedicated to the gods or [[pharaoh]]s were designed with a great deal of architectural sculpture inside and out:  engaged statues, carved columns and pillars, and wall surfaces carved with bas-reliefs. The classic examples of Egyptian colossal monuments (the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], the [[Abu Simbel temples]], the [[Karnak]] Temple Complex, etc.) represent thoroughly integrated combinations of architecture and sculpture.

Obelisks, elaborately carved from a single block of stone, were usually placed in pairs to flank the entrances to temples and pyramids. Reliefs are also common in Egyptian building, depicting scenes of everyday life and often accompanied by [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]].

==Assyro-Babylonian==
[[File:Ashurnasipal with official.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Ashurnasipal with officials]]
The [[Fertile Crescent]] architectural sculptural tradition began when [[Ashurnasirpal II]] moved his capitol to the city of [[Nimrud]] around 879 BCE.  This site was located near a major deposit of gypsum ([[alabaster]]).  This fairly easy to cut stone could be quarried in large blocks that allowed them to be easily carved for the palaces that were built there.  The early style developed out of an already flourishing mural tradition by creating drawings that were then carved in low relief.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, Julian, ''Assyrian Sculpture'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts,  1983 pp. 17-21&lt;/ref&gt;  Another contributing factor in the development of architectural sculpture were the small carved seals that had been made in the area for centuries.

Classical Greek architecture, like the prototypical [[Parthenon]], incorporate architectural sculpture in a fairly narrow set of standard, formal building elements.  The names of these elements still comprise the usual vocabulary for discussion:  the [[pediment]], the [[Metope (architecture)|metope]], the [[frieze]], the [[caryatid]], the [[quadriga]], [[acroteria]], etc.

Greek examples of architectural sculpture are distinguished not only by their age but their very high quality and skillful technique, with rhythmic and dynamic modeling, figural compositions in friezes that continue seamlessly over vertical joints from one block of stone to the next, and mastery of depth and legibility.

The known Greek and Roman examples have been exhaustively studied, and frequently copied or adapted into subsequent neo-classical styles:  [[Greek Revival architecture]], usually the most strict; [[Neoclassical architecture]]; [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] with its exaggerated and romantic free interpretations of the vocabulary, and even Stalinist neo-classical architecture like the [[Central Moscow Hippodrome]] adapted to a totalitarian aesthetic.  These re-interpretations are sometimes dubious, for instance, there are many modern copies of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], like the [[National Diet Building]] in Tokyo, despite the fact that all classical descriptions of the Mausoleum are vague.

[[File:Pediment, Philly Art Museum (3).jpg|right|250px|thumb|pediment sculpture detail, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], sculptor [[C. Paul Jennewein]], 1933]]

Not until about 1870 did the U.S. develop the talent, the economic power, and the taste for buildings grand enough to need architectural sculpture.  The [[Philadelphia City Hall]], constructed 1871 through 1901, is recognized as the turning point,&lt;ref&gt;Gurney, George, Sculpture of a City—Philadelphia's Treasures in Bronze and Stone, Fairmount Park Association, Walker Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; because of the approximately 250 sculptures planned for the building, the large [[finial]] of [[William Penn]], and the practical effect of [[Alexander Milne Calder]] training many assistants there.

In the same years, [[H.H. Richardson]] began to develop his influential signature genre, which included romantic, medieval, and Romanesque stone carving.  [[Richard Morris Hunt]] became the first to bring the Parisian neo-classical [[École des Beaux-Arts]] style back to the United States, a style that depended on integrated figural sculpture and a highly ornamented building fabric for its aesthetic effect.  The Beaux-Arts style dominated for major public buildings between the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, through about 1912, the year of the [[San Francisco City Hall]].  The need for sculptors saw the emergence of a small industry of carvers and modelers, and a professional organization, the [[National Sculpture Society]].

The advent of steel frames and reinforced concrete encouraged, at first, more diverse building styles into the 1910s and 1920s.  The diversity of skyscraper Gothic, exotic "revivals" of Mayan and Egyptian, [[Stripped Classicism]], [[Art Deco]], etc. called for a similar diversity of sculptural approaches.  The use of sculpture was still expected, particularly for public buildings such as war memorials and museums.  In 1926 the pre-eminent American architectural sculptor, [[Lee Lawrie]], with his longtime friend and collaborator architect [[Bertram Goodhue]], developed perhaps the most sophisticated American examples at the [[Nebraska State Capitol]] and the [[Los Angeles Public Library]].

Goodhue's premature death ended that collaboration.  The [[Great Depression|Depression]], and the onset of World War II, decimated building activity.  The old building trades disbanded.  By the postwar years the aesthetic of architectural modernism had taken hold.  Except for a few diehards and regional sculptors, the profession was not only dead but discredited.  As of 2010 there are isolated signs of a revival of interest, for instance in the career of [[Raymond Kaskey]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4089">The '''chain-linked model''' or '''Kline model''' of innovation was introduced by mechanical engineer Stephen J. Kline in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;Kline (1985). Research, Invention, Innovation and Production: Models and Reality, Report INN-1, March 1985, Mechanical Engineering Department, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; and further described by Kline and economist [[Nathan Rosenberg]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, S.J. &amp; N. Rosenberg (1986). “An overview of innovation.” In R. Landau &amp; N. Rosenberg (eds.), The Positive Sum Strategy: Harnessing Technology for Economic Growth. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, pp. 275–305.&lt;/ref&gt; The chain-linked model is an attempt to describe complexities in the  [[innovation]] process. The model is regarded as Kline's most significant contribution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.stanford.edu/pr/97/971028kline.html Salisbury, David F., "Memorial for Stephen Kline; engineer, interdisciplinary thinker," news release, Stanford University, October 27, 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In the chain-linked model, new knowledge is not necessarily the driver for innovation.  Instead, the process begins with the identification of an unfilled market need.  This drives research and design, then redesign and production, and finally marketing, with complex [[feedback]] loops between all the stages.  There are also important feedback loops with the organization's and the world's stored base of knowledge, with new basic research conducted or commissioned as necessary, to fill in gaps. 

It is often contrasted with the so-called [[linear model of innovation]],&lt;ref&gt;Caraça, João,  Bengt-Åke Lundvall, and Sandro Mendonça (2009).  “The changing role of science in the innovation process: From Queen to Cinderella?” Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change 76, 861–867.&lt;/ref&gt; in which basic research leads to applied development, then engineering, then manufacturing, and finally marketing and distribution.

==Applications==
The Kline model was conceived primarily with commercial industrial settings in mind, but has found broad applicability in other settings, for example in military technology development.&lt;ref&gt;Marius Vassiliou, Stan Davis, and Jonathan Agre (2011).  Innovation Patterns in Some Successful C2 Technologies." Proc. 16th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium, Quebec, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;  Variations and extensions of the model have been described by a number of investigators.&lt;ref&gt;Kameoka, A., D. Ito, and K.

[[Image:AKMuseum5.JPG|right|thumb|165px|Crown glass]]

'''Crown glass''' was an early type of window glass. In this process, glass was [[glassblowing|blown]] into a "crown" or hollow globe. This was then transferred from the [[Blowpipe (tool)|blowpipe]] to a [[punty]] and then flattened by reheating and spinning out the bowl-shaped piece of glass (bullion) into a flat disk by [[centrifugal force]], up to 5 or 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8 metres) in diameter. The glass was then cut to the size required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Glassblowing Process | work=Sugar Hollow Glass | url=http://www.sugarhollowglass.com/process.html | accessdate=June 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thinnest glass was in a band at the edge of the disk, with the glass becoming thicker and more opaque toward the center. Known as a '''bullseye''', the thicker center area around the [[pontil mark]] was used for less expensive windows. In order to fill large window spaces with the best glass, many small diamond shapes would be cut from the edge of the disk and these would be mounted in a [[Leadlight|lead lattice work]] and fitted into the window frame. 

Crown glass was one of the two most common processes for making window glass until the 19th century. The other was [[blown plate]]. The process was first perfected by French glassmakers in the 1320s, notably around [[Rouen]], and was a trade secret. As a result, crown glass was not made in London until 1678.

Crown glass is one of many types of hand-blown glass. Other methods include: [[broad sheet]], [[blown plate]], [[polished plate]] and [[cylinder blown sheet]]. These methods of manufacture lasted at least until the end of the 19th century. The early 20th century marks the move away from hand-blown to machine manufactured glass such as [[rolled plate]], [[machine drawn cylinder sheet]], [[flat drawn sheet]], [[single and twin ground polished plate]] and [[float glass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Hand-blown glass: manufacturing process | work=London Crown Glass Company | url=http://londoncrownglass.com/Manufacturing.html | accessdate=May 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cryptography''' or '''cryptology''' (from {{lang-grc|{{wikt-lang|grc|κρυπτός}}|translit=kryptós}} "hidden, secret"; and {{wikt-lang|grc|γράφειν}} ''graphein'', "to write", or {{wikt-lang|grc|-λογία}} ''[[-logy|-logia]]'', "study", respectively&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Liddell|first=Henry George|authorlink=Henry George Liddell|last2=Scott|first2=Robert|last3=Jones|first3=Henry Stuart|authorlink3=Henry Stuart Jones|last4=McKenzie|first4=Roderick|title=A Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1984|title-link=A Greek-English Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the practice and study of techniques for [[secure communication]] in the presence of third parties called [[adversary (cryptography)|adversaries]].&lt;ref name="rivest90"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ronald L.|last=Rivest|authorlink=Ron Rivest|editor=J. Van Leeuwen|title=Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science|chapter=Cryptography|volume=1|publisher=Elsevier|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing [[communications protocol|protocols]] that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages;&lt;ref name="modern-crypto"&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Mihir|last1=Bellare|first2=Phillip|last2=Rogaway|title=Introduction to Modern Cryptography|chapter=Introduction|page=10|date=21 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; various aspects in [[information security]] such as data [[confidentiality]], [[data integrity]], [[authentication]], and [[non-repudiation]]&lt;ref name="hac"/&gt; are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[electrical engineering]], [[communication science]], and [[physics]]. Applications of cryptography include [[electronic commerce]], [[Credit card chip|chip-based payment cards]], [[digital currencies]], [[password|computer passwords]], and [[military communications]].

Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with ''[[encryption]]'', the conversion of information from a readable state to apparent [[nonsense]]. The originator of an encrypted message shares the decoding technique only with intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries. The cryptography literature often uses the name Alice ("A") for the sender, Bob ("B") for the intended recipient, and Eve ("[[eavesdropper]]") for the adversary.&lt;ref name="codesintro"&gt;{{cite book|first=Norman|last=Biggs|title=Codes: An introduction to Information Communication and Cryptography|publisher=Springer|year=2008|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the development of [[Rotor machine|rotor cipher machines]] in [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] and the advent of [[computer]]s in [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], the methods used to carry out cryptology have become increasingly complex and its application more widespread.

{{Anchor|infeasible}}Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around [[computational hardness assumption]]s, making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary. It is theoretically possible to break such a system, but it is infeasible to do so by any known practical means. These schemes are therefore termed computationally secure; theoretical advances, e.g., improvements in [[integer factorization]] algorithms, and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted. There exist [[Information theoretic security|information-theoretically secure]] schemes that {{not a typo|probably}} cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power—an example is the [[one-time pad]]—but these schemes are more difficult to implement than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms.

The growth of cryptographic technology has raised a number of legal issues in the information age. Cryptography's potential for use as a tool for [[espionage]] and [[sedition]] has led many governments to classify it as a weapon and to limit or even prohibit its use and export.&lt;ref name="cryptolaw"/&gt; In some jurisdictions where the use of cryptography is legal, laws permit investigators to [[Key disclosure law|compel the disclosure]] of encryption keys for documents relevant to an investigation.&lt;ref name="UK law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RangerSteve1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-undercover-war-on-your-internet-secrets-how-online-surveillance-cracked-our-trust-in-the-web/ | title=The undercover war on your internet secrets: How online surveillance cracked our trust in the web | last=Ranger | first=Steve | website= | publisher=TechRepublic  | date=24 March 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612190952/http://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-undercover-war-on-your-internet-secrets-how-online-surveillance-cracked-our-trust-in-the-web/ | archive-date=2016-06-12| access-date=2016-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryptography also plays a major role in [[digital rights management]] and [[copyright infringement]] of digital media.&lt;ref name="AACS"/&gt;

==Terminology==

[[File:Caesar cipher left shift of 3.svg|Caesar cipher left shift of 3|thumb|alt=diagram showing shift three alphabetic cypher D becomes A and E becomes B|Alphabet shift ciphers are believed to have been used by [[Julius Caesar]] over 2,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="codesintro" /&gt; This is an example with k=3. In other words, the letters in the alphabet are shifted three in one direction to encrypt and three in the other direction to decrypt.]]
The first use of the term ''cryptograph'' (as opposed to ''cryptogram'') dates back to the 19th century—it originated in ''[[The Gold-Bug]]'', a novel by [[Edgar Allan Poe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenheim|1997|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until modern times, cryptography referred almost exclusively to ''encryption'', which is the process of converting ordinary information (called [[plaintext]]) into unintelligible form (called [[ciphertext]]).&lt;ref name="kahnbook" /&gt; Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext. A ''[[cipher]]'' (or ''cypher'') is a pair of [[algorithm]]s that create the encryption and the reversing decryption. The detailed operation of a cipher is controlled both by the algorithm and in each instance by a "[[key (cryptography)|key]]". The key is a secret (ideally known only to the communicants), usually a short string of characters, which is needed to decrypt the ciphertext.  Formally, a "[[cryptosystem]]" is the ordered list of elements of finite possible plaintexts, finite possible cyphertexts, finite possible keys, and the encryption and decryption algorithms which correspond to each key.  Keys are important both formally and in actual practice, as ciphers without variable keys can be trivially broken with only the knowledge of the cipher used and are therefore useless (or even counter-productive) for most purposes.

Historically, ciphers were often used directly for encryption or decryption without additional procedures such as [[authentication]] or integrity checks. There are two kinds of cryptosystems: [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric]] and [[Public-key cryptography|asymmetric]]. In symmetric systems the same key (the secret key) is used to encrypt and decrypt a message. Data manipulation in symmetric systems is faster than asymmetric systems as they generally use shorter key lengths. Asymmetric systems use a public key to encrypt a message and a private key to decrypt it. Use of asymmetric systems enhances the security of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.giac.org/paper/gsec/2604/introduction-modern-cryptosystems/104482|title = An Introduction to Modern Cryptosystems|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of asymmetric systems include RSA ([[Rivest-Shamir-Adleman]]), and ECC ([[Elliptic Curve Cryptography]]). Symmetric models include the commonly used AES ([[Advanced Encryption Standard]]) which replaced the older DES ([[Data Encryption Standard]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Quantum cryptography: An emerging technology in network security|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6107841&amp;isnumber=6107829|journal = 2011 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)|date = 2011-11-01|pages = 13–19|doi = 10.1109/THS.2011.6107841|first = M.S.|last = Sharbaf|isbn = 978-1457713767}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[colloquial]] use, the term "[[code (cryptography)|code]]" is often used to mean any method of encryption or concealment of meaning. However, in cryptography, ''code'' has a more specific meaning. It means the replacement of a unit of plaintext (i.e., a meaningful word or phrase) with a [[code word]] (for example, "wallaby" replaces "attack at dawn").

[[Cryptanalysis]] is the term used for the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information without access to the key normally required to do so; i.e., it is the study of how to crack encryption algorithms or their implementations.

Some use the terms ''cryptography'' and ''cryptology'' interchangeably in English, while others (including US military practice generally) use ''cryptography'' to refer specifically to the use and practice of cryptographic techniques and ''cryptology'' to refer to the combined study of cryptography and cryptanalysis.&lt;ref name="goldreichbook"&gt;[[Oded Goldreich]], ''Foundations of Cryptography, Volume 1: Basic Tools'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0521791723}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="websters"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]] |title=Cryptology (definition) |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cryptology |accessdate=26 March 2015 |edition=11th |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; English is more flexible than several other languages in which ''cryptology'' (done by cryptologists) is always used in the second sense above. {{IETF RFC|2828}} advises that [[steganography]] is sometimes included in cryptology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|rfc=2828|title=Internet Security Glossary|website=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]]|date=May 2000|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2828|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of characteristics of languages that have some application in cryptography or cryptology (e.g. frequency data, letter combinations, universal patterns, etc.) is called cryptolinguistics.

==History of cryptography and cryptanalysis==
{{Main|History of cryptography}}
Before the modern era, cryptography focused on message confidentiality (i.e., encryption)—conversion of [[information|messages]] from a comprehensible form into an incomprehensible one and back again at the other end, rendering it unreadable by interceptors or eavesdroppers without secret knowledge (namely the key needed for decryption of that message). Encryption attempted to ensure [[secrecy]] in [[communications]], such as those of [[spy|spies]], military leaders, and [[diplomat]]s. In recent decades, the field has expanded beyond confidentiality concerns to include techniques for message integrity checking, sender/receiver identity [[authentication]], [[digital signature]]s, [[Interactive proof system|interactive proofs]] and [[secure multiparty computation|secure computation]], among others.

===Classic cryptography===
[[File:Skytala&amp;EmptyStrip-Shaded.png|thumb|alt=Skytala stick with strip of paper wound around in spiral|Reconstructed [[ancient Greek]] ''[[scytale]]'', an early cipher device]]
The main classical cipher types are [[transposition cipher]]s, which rearrange the order of letters in a message (e.g., 'hello world' becomes 'ehlol owrdl' in a trivially simple rearrangement scheme), and [[substitution cipher]]s, which systematically replace letters or groups of letters with other letters or groups of letters (e.g., 'fly at once' becomes 'gmz bu podf' by replacing each letter with the one following it in the [[Latin alphabet]]). Simple versions of either have never offered much confidentiality from enterprising opponents. An early substitution cipher was the [[Caesar cipher]], in which each letter in the plaintext was replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions further down the alphabet. [[Suetonius]] reports that [[Julius Caesar]] used it with a shift of three to communicate with his generals. [[Atbash]] is an example of an early Hebrew cipher. The earliest known use of cryptography is some carved ciphertext on stone in [[Egypt]] (ca 1900 BCE), but this may have been done for the amusement of literate observers rather than as a way of concealing information.

The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks of Classical times]] are said to have known of ciphers (e.g., the scytale transposition cipher claimed to have been used by the [[Sparta]]n military).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=V.V.|last=I︠A︡shchenko|title=Cryptography: an introduction|year=2002|url={{Google books|cH-NGrpcIMcC|page=6|plainurl=yes}}|publisher=AMS Bookstore|page=6|isbn=978-0821829868}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steganography]] (i.e., hiding even the existence of a message so as to keep it confidential) was also first developed in ancient times. An early example, from [[Herodotus]], was a message tattooed on a slave's shaved head and concealed under the regrown hair.&lt;ref name="kahnbook"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kahn|first=David|authorlink=David Kahn (writer)|title=The Codebreakers|year=1967|isbn=978-0684831305|title-link=The Codebreakers}}&lt;/ref&gt; More modern examples of steganography include the use of [[invisible ink]], [[microdot]]s, and [[digital watermark]]s to conceal information.

In India, the 2000-year-old [[Kamasutra]] of [[Vātsyāyana]] speaks of two different kinds of ciphers called Kautiliyam and Mulavediya. In the Kautiliyam, the cipher letter substitutions are based on phonetic relations, such as vowels becoming consonants. In the Mulavediya, the cipher alphabet consists of pairing letters and using the reciprocal ones.&lt;ref name="kahnbook" /&gt;

In [[Sassanid Persia]], there were two secret scripts, according to the Muslim author [[Ibn al-Nadim]]: the ''šāh-dabīrīya'' (literally "King's script") which was used for official correspondence, and the ''rāz-saharīya'' which was used to communicate secret messages with other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/codes-romuz-sg|title=CODES – Encyclopaedia Iranica|last=electricpulp.com|date=|website=www.iranicaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Al-kindi cryptographic.png|thumb|alt=Arabic text of a book by Al-Kindi|First page of a book by [[Al-Kindi]] which discusses encryption of messages]]

Ciphertexts produced by a [[classical cipher]] (and some modern ciphers) will reveal statistical information about the plaintext, and that information can often be used to break the cipher. After the discovery of [[frequency analysis]], perhaps by the [[mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematician]] and [[polymath]] [[Al-Kindi]] (also known as ''Alkindus'') in the 9th century,&lt;ref name="Singh14-20"&gt;{{cite book |first=Simon |last=Singh |authorlink=Simon Singh |title=The Code Book |pages=14–20 |location=New York |publisher=[[Anchor Books]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0385495325|title-link=The Code Book }}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly all such ciphers could be broken by an informed attacker. Such classical ciphers still enjoy popularity today, though mostly as [[puzzle]]s (see [[cryptogram]]). Al-Kindi wrote a book on cryptography entitled ''Risalah fi Istikhraj al-Mu'amma'' (''Manuscript for the Deciphering Cryptographic Messages''), which described the first known use of frequency analysis [[cryptanalysis]] techniques.&lt;ref name="Singh14-20"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kadi&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Ibrahim A.|last=Al-Kadi|date=April 1992|title=The origins of cryptology: The Arab contributions|journal=[[Cryptologia]]|volume=16|number=2|pages=97–126|doi=10.1080/0161-119291866801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:16th century French cypher machine in the shape of a book with arms of Henri II.jpg|thumb|alt=book sized metal machine with large dial left page and nineteen small dials right page|16th-century book-shaped [[France|French]] cipher machine, with arms of [[Henri II of France]]]]

Language letter frequencies may offer little help for some extended historical encryption techniques such as [[Substitution cipher#Homophonic substitution|homophonic cipher]] that tend to flatten the frequency distribution. For those ciphers, language letter group (or n-gram) frequencies may provide an attack.

Essentially all ciphers remained vulnerable to cryptanalysis using the frequency analysis technique until the development of the polyalphabetic cipher, most clearly by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] around the year 1467, though there is some indication that it was already known to Al-Kindi.&lt;ref name=Kadi/&gt; Alberti's innovation was to use different ciphers (i.e., substitution alphabets) for various parts of a message (perhaps for each successive plaintext letter at the limit). He also invented what was probably the first automatic [[Alberti Cipher Disk|cipher device]], a wheel which implemented a partial realization of his invention. In the [[Vigenère cipher]], a [[polyalphabetic cipher]], encryption uses a ''key word'', which controls letter substitution depending on which letter of the key word is used. In the mid-19th century [[Charles Babbage]] showed that the Vigenère cipher was vulnerable to [[Kasiski examination]], but this was first published about ten years later by [[Friedrich Kasiski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrödel |first=Tobias|date=October 2008|title=Breaking Short Vigenère Ciphers |journal=[[Cryptologia]]|volume=32|issue=4|pages=334–337|doi=10.1080/01611190802336097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although frequency analysis can be a powerful and general technique against many ciphers, encryption has still often been effective in practice, as many a would-be cryptanalyst was unaware of the technique. Breaking a message without using frequency analysis essentially required knowledge of the cipher used and perhaps of the key involved, thus making espionage, bribery, burglary, defection, etc., more attractive approaches to the cryptanalytically uninformed. It was finally explicitly recognized in the 19th century that secrecy of a cipher's algorithm is not a sensible nor practical safeguard of message security; in fact, it was further realized that any adequate cryptographic scheme (including ciphers) should remain secure even if the adversary fully understands the cipher algorithm itself. Security of the key used should alone be sufficient for a good cipher to maintain confidentiality under an attack. This fundamental principle was first explicitly stated in 1883 by [[Auguste Kerckhoffs]] and is generally called [[Kerckhoffs's Principle]]; alternatively and more bluntly, it was restated by [[Claude Shannon]], the inventor of [[information theory]] and the fundamentals of theoretical cryptography, as ''Shannon's Maxim''—'the enemy knows the system'.

Different physical devices and aids have been used to assist with ciphers. One of the earliest may have been the scytale of [[ancient Greece]], a rod supposedly used by the Spartans as an aid for a transposition cipher (see image above). In medieval times, other aids were invented such as the [[grille (cryptography)|cipher grille]], which was also used for a kind of steganography. With the invention of polyalphabetic ciphers came more sophisticated aids such as Alberti's own [[cipher disk]], [[Johannes Trithemius]]' [[tabula recta]] scheme, and [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Jefferson disk|wheel cypher]] (not publicly known, and reinvented independently by [[Bazeries]] around 1900). Many mechanical encryption/decryption devices were invented early in the 20th century, and several patented, among them [[rotor machine]]s—famously including the [[Enigma machine]] used by the German government and military from the late 1920s and during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hakim | first = Joy | authorlink = Joy Hakim | title = A History of US: War, Peace and all that Jazz | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 1995 | location = New York | isbn = 978-0195095142 | title-link = A History of US }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ciphers implemented by better quality examples of these machine designs brought about a substantial increase in cryptanalytic difficulty after WWI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gannon|first=James|authorlink=James Gannon|title=Stealing Secrets, Telling Lies: How Spies and Codebreakers Helped Shape the Twentieth Century|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Brassey's|year=2001|isbn=978-1574883671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer era===
[[Cryptanalysis]] of the new mechanical devices proved to be both difficult and laborious. In the United Kingdom, cryptanalytic efforts at [[Bletchley Park]] during WWII spurred the development of more efficient means for carrying out repetitious tasks. This culminated in the development of the [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first fully electronic, digital, [[computer programming|programmable]] computer, which assisted in the decryption of ciphers generated by the German Army's [[Lorenz SZ40/42]] machine.

Just as the development of digital computers and electronics helped in cryptanalysis, it made possible much more complex ciphers. Furthermore, computers allowed for the encryption of any kind of data representable in any binary format, unlike classical ciphers which only encrypted written language texts; this was new and significant. Computer use has thus supplanted linguistic cryptography, both for cipher design and cryptanalysis. Many computer ciphers can be characterized by their operation on [[binary numeral system|binary]] [[bit]] sequences (sometimes in groups or blocks), unlike classical and mechanical schemes, which generally manipulate traditional characters (i.e., letters and digits) directly. However, computers have also assisted cryptanalysis, which has compensated to some extent for increased cipher complexity. Nonetheless, good modern ciphers have stayed ahead of cryptanalysis; it is typically the case that use of a quality cipher is very efficient (i.e., fast and requiring few resources, such as memory or CPU capability), while breaking it requires an effort many orders of magnitude larger, and vastly larger than that required for any classical cipher, making cryptanalysis so inefficient and impractical as to be effectively impossible.

Extensive open academic research into cryptography is relatively recent; it began only in the mid-1970s. In recent times, IBM personnel designed the algorithm that became the Federal (i.e., US) [[Data Encryption Standard]]; [[Whitfield Diffie]] and [[Martin Hellman]] published [[Diffie-Hellman|their key agreement algorithm]];&lt;ref name="dh2"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Whitfield|last=Diffie|authorlink=Whitfield Diffie|first2=Martin|last2=Hellman|authorlink2=Martin Hellman|title=New Directions in Cryptography|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|volume=IT-22|issue=6|date=November 1976|pages=644–654|url=http://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf|doi=10.1109/tit.1976.1055638|citeseerx=10.1.1.37.9720}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] algorithm was published in [[Martin Gardner]]'s ''[[Scientific American]]'' column. Following their work in 1976, it became popular to consider cryptography systems based on mathematical problems that are easy to state but have been found difficult to solve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1089|isbn=978-1579550080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, cryptography has become a widely used tool in communications, [[computer network]]s, and [[computer security]] generally. Some modern cryptographic techniques can only keep their keys secret if certain mathematical problems are [[Computational complexity theory#Intractability|intractable]], such as the [[integer factorization]] or the [[discrete logarithm]] problems, so there are deep connections with [[abstract mathematics]]. There are very few cryptosystems that are proven to be unconditionally secure. The [[one-time pad]] is one, and was proven to be so by Claude Shannon. There are a few important algorithms that have been proven secure under certain assumptions. For example, the infeasibility of factoring extremely large integers is the basis for believing that [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] is secure, and some other systems, but even so proof of unbreakability is unavailable since the underlying mathematical problem remains open. In practice, these are widely used, and are believed unbreakable in practice by most competent observers.  There are systems similar to RSA, such as one by [[Michael O. Rabin]] that are provably secure provided factoring  ''n = pq'' is impossible;  it is quite unusable in practice. The [[discrete logarithm problem]] is the basis for believing some other cryptosystems are secure, and again, there are related, less practical systems that are provably secure relative to the solvability or insolvability discrete log problem.&lt;ref&gt;''Cryptography: Theory and Practice'', Third Edition (Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications), 2005, by Douglas R. Stinson, Chapman and Hall/CRC&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as being aware of cryptographic history, cryptographic algorithm and system designers must also sensibly consider probable future developments while working on their designs. For instance, continuous improvements in computer processing power have increased the scope of [[brute-force attack]]s, so when specifying [[key length]]s, the required key lengths are similarly advancing.&lt;ref name="fortify"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortify.net/related/cryptographers.html|title=Minimal key lengths for symmetric ciphers to provide adequate commercial security|first1=Matt|last1=Blaze|authorlink1=Matt Blaze|first2=Whitefield|last2=Diffie|authorlink2=Whitfield Diffie|first3=Ronald L.|last3=Rivest|authorlink3=Ron Rivest|first4=Bruce|last4=Schneier|authorlink4=Bruce Schneier|first5=Tsutomu|last5=Shimomura|authorlink5=Tsutomu Shimomura|first6=Eric|last6=Thompson|first7=Michael|last7=Wiener| date=January 1996 |publisher=[[Fortify (Netscape)|Fortify]]|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The potential effects of [[quantum computing]] are already being considered by some cryptographic system designers developing [[post-quantum cryptography]]; the announced imminence of small implementations of these machines may be making the need for preemptive caution rather more than merely speculative.&lt;ref name="hac"&gt;{{cite book|first=A.J. |last=Menezes |first2=P.C. |last2=van Oorschot |first3=S.A. |last3=Vanstone |url=http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/ |title=Handbook of Applied Cryptography |publisher= |isbn=978-0849385230 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307081354/http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/ |archivedate=7 March 2005 |year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, prior to the early 20th century, cryptography was chiefly concerned with [[language|linguistic]] and [[lexicographic code|lexicographic]] patterns. Since then the emphasis has shifted, and cryptography now makes extensive use of mathematics, including aspects of [[information theory]], [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]], [[statistics]], [[combinatorics]], [[abstract algebra]], [[number theory]], and finite mathematics generally. Cryptography is also a branch of [[engineering]], but an unusual one since it deals with active, intelligent, and malevolent opposition (see [[cryptographic engineering]] and [[security engineering]]); other kinds of engineering (e.g., civil or chemical engineering) need deal only with neutral natural forces. There is also active research examining the relationship between cryptographic problems and [[quantum physics]] (see [[quantum cryptography]] and [[quantum computer]]).

==Modern cryptography==
The modern field of cryptography can be divided into several areas of study. The chief ones are discussed here; see [[Topics in Cryptography]] for more.

===Symmetric-key cryptography===
{{Main|Symmetric-key algorithm}}
[[File:Symmetric key encryption.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=diagram showing encrypt with a key and decrypt process|Symmetric-key cryptography, where a single key is used for encryption and decryption]]
Symmetric-key cryptography refers to encryption methods in which both the sender and receiver share the same key (or, less commonly, in which their keys are different, but related in an easily computable way). This was the only kind of encryption publicly known until June 1976.&lt;ref name="dh2"/&gt;
[[File:International Data Encryption Algorithm InfoBox Diagram.svg|thumb|alt=logic diagram showing International Data Encryption Algorithm cypher process|One round (out of 8.5) of the [[International Data Encryption Algorithm|IDEA]] cipher, used in some versions of [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] for high-speed encryption of, for instance, [[electronic mail|e-mail]]]]
Symmetric key ciphers are implemented as either [[block ciphers]] or [[stream ciphers]]. A block cipher enciphers input in blocks of plaintext as opposed to individual characters, the input form used by a stream cipher.

The [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES) and the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) are block cipher designs that have been designated [[cryptography standards]] by the US government (though DES's designation was finally withdrawn after the AES was adopted).&lt;ref name="aes"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf|title=FIPS PUB 197: The official Advanced Encryption Standard|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]|website=Computer Security Resource Center|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its deprecation as an official standard, DES (especially its still-approved and much more secure [[triple-DES]] variant) remains quite popular; it is used across a wide range of applications, from ATM encryption&lt;ref name="atm"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncua.gov/Resources/Documents/LCU2004-09.pdf|title=NCUA letter to credit unions|website=[[National Credit Union Administration]]|format=PDF|date=July 2004|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[e-mail privacy]]&lt;ref name="opgp"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Open PGP Message Format|rfc=2440|website=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]]|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2440|date=November 1998|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Secure Shell|secure remote access]].&lt;ref name="ssh"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.windowsecurity.com/articles/SSH.html|title=SSH|website=WindowSecurity|first=Pawel|last=Golen|date=19 July 2002|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other block ciphers have been designed and released, with considerable variation in quality. Many, even some designed by capable practitioners, have been thoroughly broken, such as [[FEAL]].&lt;ref name="hac" /&gt;&lt;ref name="schneierbook"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Bruce|last=Schneier|authorlink=Bruce Schneier|title=Applied Cryptography|edition=2nd|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]]|year=1996|isbn=978-0471117094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stream ciphers, in contrast to the 'block' type, create an arbitrarily long stream of key material, which is combined with the plaintext bit-by-bit or character-by-character, somewhat like the [[one-time pad]]. In a stream cipher, the output stream is created based on a hidden internal state that changes as the cipher operates. That internal state is initially set up using the secret key material. [[RC4]] is a widely used stream cipher; see [[:Category:Stream ciphers]].&lt;ref name="hac" /&gt; Block ciphers can be used as stream ciphers; see [[Block cipher modes of operation]].

[[Cryptographic hash functions]] are a third type of cryptographic algorithm. They take a message of any length as input, and output a short, fixed length [[hash function|hash]], which can be used in (for example) a digital signature. For good hash functions, an attacker cannot find two messages that produce the same hash. [[MD4]] is a long-used hash function that is now broken; [[MD5]], a strengthened variant of MD4, is also widely used but broken in practice. The US [[National Security Agency]] developed the Secure Hash Algorithm series of MD5-like hash functions: SHA-0 was a flawed algorithm that the agency withdrew; [[SHA-1]] is widely deployed and more secure than MD5, but cryptanalysts have identified attacks against it; the [[SHA-2]] family improves on SHA-1, but it isn't yet widely deployed; and the US standards authority thought it "prudent" from a security perspective to develop a new standard to "significantly improve the robustness of [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]'s overall hash algorithm toolkit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Notices|journal=[[Federal Register]]|volume=72|number=212|date=2 November 2007}}&lt;br /&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228075550/http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/documents/FR_Notice_Nov07.pdf |date=28 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a [[NIST hash function competition|hash function design competition]] was meant to select a new U.S. national standard, to be called [[SHA-3]], by 2012. The competition ended on October 2, 2012 when the NIST announced that [[Keccak]] would be the new SHA-3 hash algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/sha-100212.cfm|title=NIST Selects Winner of Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-3) Competition|website=Tech Beat|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]|date=October 2, 2012|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike block and stream ciphers that are invertible, cryptographic hash functions produce a hashed output that cannot be used to retrieve the original input data. Cryptographic hash functions are used to verify the authenticity of data retrieved from an untrusted source or to add a layer of security.

[[Message authentication code]]s (MACs) are much like cryptographic hash functions, except that a secret key can be used to authenticate the hash value upon receipt;&lt;ref name="hac" /&gt; this additional complication blocks an attack scheme against bare [[Md5|digest algorithms]], and so has been thought worth the effort.

===Public-key cryptography===
{{Main|Public-key cryptography}}
[[File:Public key encryption.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=diagram of Public-key cryptography showing public key and private key|Public-key cryptography, where different keys are used for encryption and decryption.]]
[[File:TLS indicator in Firefox 34.png|thumb|250px|alt=padlock icon in the internet browser line next to the url|Padlock icon from the [[Firefox]] [[Web browser]], which indicates that [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]], a public-key cryptography system, is in use.]]
Symmetric-key cryptosystems use the same key for encryption and decryption of a message, although a message or group of messages can have a different key than others. A significant disadvantage of symmetric ciphers is the [[key management]] necessary to use them securely. Each distinct pair of communicating parties must, ideally, share a different key, and perhaps for each ciphertext exchanged as well. The number of keys required increases as the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the number of network members, which very quickly requires complex key management schemes to keep them all consistent and secret. The difficulty of securely establishing a secret key between two communicating parties, when a [[secure channel]] does not already exist between them, also presents a [[chicken-and-egg problem]] which is a considerable practical obstacle for cryptography users in the real world.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

{{stack|[[File:Diffie and Hellman.jpg|thumb|alt=headshots of Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman|[[Whitfield Diffie]] and [[Martin Hellman]], authors of the first published paper on public-key cryptography.]]}}
In a groundbreaking 1976 paper, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman proposed the notion of ''public-key'' (also, more generally, called ''asymmetric key'') cryptography in which two different but mathematically related keys are used—a ''public'' key and a ''private'' key.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Whitfield|last=Diffie|authorlink=Whitfield Diffie|first2=Martin|last2=Hellman|authorlink2=Martin Hellman|title=Multi-user cryptographic techniques|journal=AFIPS Proceedings|volume=45|pages=109–112|date=8 June 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; A public key system is so constructed that calculation of one key (the 'private key') is computationally infeasible from the other (the 'public key'), even though they are necessarily related. Instead, both keys are generated secretly, as an interrelated pair.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Merkle]] was working on similar ideas at the time and encountered publication delays, and Hellman has suggested that the term used should be Diffie–Hellman–Merkle aysmmetric key cryptography.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] described public-key cryptography as "the most revolutionary new concept in the field since polyalphabetic substitution emerged in the Renaissance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=David|last=Kahn|title=Cryptology Goes Public|journal=[[Foreign Affairs]]|volume=58|number=1|date=Fall 1979|page=153|doi=10.2307/20040343|jstor=20040343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In public-key cryptosystems, the public key may be freely distributed, while its paired private key must remain secret. In a public-key encryption system, the ''public key'' is used for encryption, while the ''private'' or ''secret key'' is used for decryption. While Diffie and Hellman could not find such a system, they showed that public-key cryptography was indeed possible by presenting the [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]] protocol, a solution that is now widely used in secure communications to allow two parties to secretly agree on a [[symmetric-key algorithm|shared encryption key]].&lt;ref name="dh2"/&gt;

Diffie and Hellman's publication sparked widespread academic efforts in finding a practical public-key encryption system. This race was finally won in 1978 by [[Ronald Rivest]], [[Adi Shamir]], and [[Len Adleman]], whose solution has since become known as the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Ronald L.|last=Rivest|authorlink=Ronald L. Rivest|first2=A.|last2=Shamir|first3=L.|last3=Adleman|title=A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=21|number=2|pages=120–126|year=1978|doi=10.1145/359340.359342|citeseerx=10.1.1.607.2677}}&lt;br /&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011116122233/http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/rsapaper.pdf |date=16 November 2001 }}&lt;br /&gt;Previously released as an [[MIT]] "Technical Memo" in April 1977, and published in [[Martin Gardner]]'s ''[[Scientific American]]'' [[Mathematical recreations]] column&lt;/ref&gt;

The Diffie–Hellman and RSA algorithms, in addition to being the first publicly known examples of high quality public-key algorithms, have been among the most widely used. Other [[:Category:Asymmetric-key algorithms|asymmetric-key algorithms]] include the [[Cramer–Shoup cryptosystem]], [[ElGamal encryption]], and various [[Elliptic curve cryptography|elliptic curve techniques]].{{fact|date=August 2018}}

To much surprise, a document published in 1997 by the Government Communications Headquarters ([[GCHQ]]), a British intelligence organization, revealed that cryptographers at GCHQ had anticipated several academic developments.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wayner|first=Peter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/122497encrypt.html|title=British Document Outlines Early Encryption Discovery|date=24 December 1997|accessdate=2015-03-26|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, around 1970, [[James H. Ellis]] had conceived the principles of asymmetric key cryptography. In 1973, [[Clifford Cocks]] invented a solution that essentially resembles the RSA algorithm.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/matyas/lecture/paper2.pdf|first=Clifford|last=Cocks|title=A Note on 'Non-Secret Encryption'|journal=CESG Research Report|date=20 November 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in 1974, [[Malcolm J. Williamson]] is claimed to have developed the Diffie–Hellman key exchange.&lt;ref name=singh&gt;{{ cite book | first=Simon | last=Singh | title=The Code Book | publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] | year=1999 | pages=279–292 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Private key signing.png|thumb|250px|In this example the message is only signed and not encrypted.
1) Alice signs a message with her private key.
2) Bob can verify that Alice sent the message and that the message has not been modified.]]
Public-key cryptography can also be used for implementing [[digital signature]] schemes. A digital signature is reminiscent of an ordinary [[signature]]; they both have the characteristic of being easy for a user to produce, but difficult for anyone else to [[forgery|forge]]. Digital signatures can also be permanently tied to the content of the message being signed; they cannot then be 'moved' from one document to another, for any attempt will be detectable. In digital signature schemes, there are two algorithms: one for ''signing'', in which a secret key is used to process the message (or a hash of the message, or both), and one for ''verification'', in which the matching public key is used with the message to check the validity of the signature. RSA and [[Digital Signature Algorithm|DSA]] are two of the most popular digital signature schemes. Digital signatures are central to the operation of [[public key infrastructure]]s and many network security schemes (e.g., [[Transport Layer Security|SSL/TLS]], many [[VPN]]s, etc.).&lt;ref name="schneierbook" /&gt;

Public-key algorithms are most often based on the [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of "hard" problems, often from [[number theory]]. For example, the hardness of RSA is related to the [[integer factorization]] problem, while Diffie–Hellman and DSA are related to the [[discrete logarithm]] problem. More recently, [[elliptic curve cryptography]] has developed, a system in which security is based on number theoretic problems involving [[elliptic curve]]s. Because of the difficulty of the underlying problems, most public-key algorithms involve operations such as [[modular arithmetic|modular]] multiplication and exponentiation, which are much more computationally expensive than the techniques used in most block ciphers, especially with typical key sizes. As a result, public-key cryptosystems are commonly [[hybrid cryptosystem]]s, in which a fast high-quality symmetric-key encryption algorithm is used for the message itself, while the relevant symmetric key is sent with the message, but encrypted using a public-key algorithm. Similarly, hybrid signature schemes are often used, in which a cryptographic hash function is computed, and only the resulting hash is digitally signed.&lt;ref name="hac" /&gt;

===Cryptanalysis===
{{Main|Cryptanalysis}}
[[File:Enigma.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Enigma machine typewriter keypad over many rotors in a wood box|Variants of the [[Enigma machine]], used by Germany's military and civil authorities from the late 1920s through [[World War II]], implemented a complex electro-mechanical polyalphabetic [[cipher]]. [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Breaking and reading of the Enigma cipher]] at Poland's [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]], for 7 years before the war, and subsequent decryption at [[Bletchley Park]], was important to Allied victory.&lt;ref name="kahnbook" /&gt;]]
The goal of cryptanalysis is to find some weakness or insecurity in a cryptographic scheme, thus permitting its subversion or evasion.

It is a common misconception that every encryption method can be broken. In connection with his WWII work at [[Bell Labs]], [[Claude Shannon]] proved that the [[one-time pad]] cipher is unbreakable, provided the key material is truly [[Statistical randomness|random]], never reused, kept secret from all possible attackers, and of equal or greater length than the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Claude|last=Shannon|first2=Warren|last2=Weaver|title=The Mathematical Theory of Communication|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|year=1963|isbn=978-0252725487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[cipher]]s, apart from the one-time pad, can be broken with enough computational effort by [[brute force attack]], but the amount of effort needed may be [[exponential time|exponentially]] dependent on the key size, as compared to the effort needed to make use of the cipher. In such cases, effective security could be achieved if it is proven that the effort required (i.e., "work factor", in Shannon's terms) is beyond the ability of any adversary. This means it must be shown that no efficient method (as opposed to the time-consuming brute force method) can be found to break the cipher. Since no such proof has been found to date, the one-time-pad remains the only theoretically unbreakable cipher.

There are a wide variety of cryptanalytic attacks, and they can be classified in any of several ways. A common distinction turns on what Eve (an attacker) knows and what capabilities are available. In a [[ciphertext-only attack]], Eve has access only to the ciphertext (good modern cryptosystems are usually effectively immune to ciphertext-only attacks). In a [[known-plaintext attack]], Eve has access to a ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext (or to many such pairs). In a [[chosen-plaintext attack]], Eve may choose a plaintext and learn its corresponding ciphertext (perhaps many times); an example is [[gardening (cryptanalysis)|gardening]], used by the British during WWII. In a [[chosen-ciphertext attack]], Eve may be able to ''choose'' ciphertexts and learn their corresponding plaintexts.&lt;ref name="hac" /&gt; Finally in a [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]] attack Eve gets in between Alice (the sender) and Bob (the recipient), accesses and modifies the traffic and then forwards it to the recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www8.cs.umu.se/education/examina/Rapporter/MattiasEriksson.pdf|title = An Example of a Man-in-the-middle Attack Against Server Authenticated SSL-sessions|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also important, often overwhelmingly so, are mistakes (generally in the design or use of one of the [[cryptographic protocol|protocols]] involved; see [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma]] for some historical examples of this).
[[File:2008-09 Kaiserschloss Kryptologen.JPG|thumb|alt=Kaiserschloss Kryptologen monument numbers on stele|[[Poznań]] monument (''center'') to Polish cryptologists whose breaking of Germany's Enigma machine ciphers, beginning in 1932, altered the course of World War II]]
Cryptanalysis of symmetric-key ciphers typically involves looking for attacks against the block ciphers or stream ciphers that are more efficient than any attack that could be against a perfect cipher. For example, a simple brute force attack against DES requires one known plaintext and 2&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt; decryptions, trying approximately half of the possible keys, to reach a point at which chances are better than even that the key sought will have been found. But this may not be enough assurance; a [[linear cryptanalysis]] attack against DES requires 2&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt; known plaintexts and approximately 2&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt; DES operations.&lt;ref name="junod"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Pascal|last=Junod|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/22094/http:zSzzSzeprint.iacr.orgzSz2001zSz056.pdf/junod01complexity.pdf|title=On the Complexity of Matsui's Attack|journal=[[Selected Areas in Cryptography]]|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a considerable improvement on brute force attacks.

Public-key algorithms are based on the computational difficulty of various problems. The most famous of these is [[integer factorization]] (e.g., the RSA algorithm is based on a problem related to integer factoring), but the [[discrete logarithm]] problem is also important. Much public-key cryptanalysis concerns numerical algorithms for solving these computational problems, or some of them, efficiently (i.e., in a practical time). For instance, the best known algorithms for solving the [[elliptic curve cryptography|elliptic curve-based]] version of discrete logarithm are much more time-consuming than the best known algorithms for factoring, at least for problems of more or less equivalent size. Thus, other things being equal, to achieve an equivalent strength of attack resistance, factoring-based encryption techniques must use larger keys than elliptic curve techniques. For this reason, public-key cryptosystems based on elliptic curves have become popular since their invention in the mid-1990s.

While pure cryptanalysis uses weaknesses in the algorithms themselves, other attacks on cryptosystems are based on actual use of the algorithms in real devices, and are called ''[[side-channel attack]]s''. If a cryptanalyst has access to, for example, the amount of time the device took to encrypt a number of plaintexts or report an error in a password or PIN character, he may be able to use a [[timing attack]] to break a cipher that is otherwise resistant to analysis. An attacker might also study the pattern and length of messages to derive valuable information; this is known as [[traffic analysis]]&lt;ref name="SWT"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Dawn|last=Song|first2=David A.|last2=Wagner|authorlink2=David A. Wagner|first3=Xuqing|last3=Tian|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/22094/http:zSzzSzeprint.iacr.orgzSz2001zSz056.pdf/junod01complexity.pdf|title=Timing Analysis of Keystrokes and Timing Attacks on SSH|journal=Tenth USENIX Security Symposium|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be quite useful to an alert adversary. Poor administration of a cryptosystem, such as permitting too short keys, will make any system vulnerable, regardless of other virtues. [[social engineering (security)|Social engineering]] and other attacks against the personnel who work with cryptosystems or the messages they handle (e.g., [[bribery]], [[extortion]], [[blackmail]], [[espionage]], [[torture]], ...) may be the most productive attacks of all.

===Cryptographic primitives===
Much of the theoretical work in cryptography concerns [[cryptographic primitive|cryptographic ''primitives'']]—algorithms with basic cryptographic properties—and their relationship to other cryptographic problems. More complicated cryptographic tools are then built from these basic primitives. These primitives provide fundamental properties, which are used to develop more complex tools called ''cryptosystems'' or ''cryptographic protocols'', which guarantee one or more high-level security properties. Note however, that the distinction between cryptographic ''primitives'' and cryptosystems, is quite arbitrary; for example, the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] algorithm is sometimes considered a cryptosystem, and sometimes a primitive. Typical examples of cryptographic primitives include [[pseudorandom function]]s, [[one-way function]]s, etc.

===Cryptosystems===
One or more cryptographic primitives are often used to develop a more complex algorithm, called a cryptographic system, or ''cryptosystem''. Cryptosystems (e.g., [[ElGamal encryption|El-Gamal encryption]]) are designed to provide particular functionality (e.g., public key encryption) while guaranteeing certain security properties (e.g., [[Chosen-plaintext attack|chosen-plaintext attack (CPA)]] security in the [[random oracle model]]). Cryptosystems use the properties of the underlying cryptographic primitives to support the system's security properties. As the distinction between primitives and cryptosystems is somewhat arbitrary, a sophisticated cryptosystem can be derived from a combination of several more primitive cryptosystems. In many cases, the cryptosystem's structure involves back and forth communication among two or more parties in space (e.g., between the sender of a secure message and its receiver) or across time (e.g., cryptographically protected [[backup]] data). Such cryptosystems are sometimes called ''[[cryptographic protocol]]s''.

Some widely known cryptosystems include [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA encryption]], [[Schnorr signature]], [[ElGamal encryption|El-Gamal encryption]], [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], etc. More complex cryptosystems include [[electronic cash]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=S. |last=Brands |url=http://ftp.se.kde.org/pub/security/docs/ecash/crypto93.ps.gz |title=Untraceable Off-line Cash in Wallets with Observers |journal=Advances in Cryptology—Proceedings of CRYPTO |year=1994 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726214409/http://ftp.se.kde.org/pub/security/docs/ecash/crypto93.ps.gz |archivedate=26 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; systems, [[signcryption]] systems, etc. Some more 'theoretical' cryptosystems include [[interactive proof system]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=László|last=Babai|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=22192|title=Trading group theory for randomness|journal=Proceedings of the Seventeenth Annual Symposium on the Theory of Computing|pages=421–429|year=1985|doi=10.1145/22145.22192|isbn=978-0897911511|citeseerx=10.1.1.130.3397}}&lt;/ref&gt; (like [[zero-knowledge proof]]s),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authorlink=Shafi Goldwasser|first=S.|last=Goldwasser|authorlink2=Silvio Micali|first2=S.|last2=Micali|authorlink3=Charles Rackoff|first3=C.|last3=Rackoff|title=The Knowledge Complexity of Interactive Proof Systems|journal=[[SIAM Journal on Computing]]|volume=18|number=1|pages=186–208|year=1989|doi=10.1137/0218012|citeseerx=10.1.1.397.4002}}&lt;/ref&gt; systems for [[secret sharing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authorlink=George Blakley|first=G.|last=Blakley|title=Safeguarding cryptographic keys|journal=Proceedings of AFIPS 1979|volume=48|pages=313–317|date=June 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=A.|last=Shamir|title=How to share a secret|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=22|issue=11|pages=612–613|year=1979|doi=10.1145/359168.359176}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

Until recently{{Clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}} most security properties of most cryptosystems were demonstrated using empirical techniques or using ad hoc reasoning. Recently{{Clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}} there has been considerable effort to develop formal techniques for establishing the security of cryptosystems; this has been generally called ''[[provable security]]''. The general idea of provable security is to give arguments about the computational difficulty needed to compromise some security aspect of the cryptosystem (i.e., to any adversary).

The study of how best to implement and integrate cryptography in software applications is itself a distinct field (see [[Cryptographic engineering]] and [[Security engineering]]).

==Legal issues==
{{See also|Cryptography laws in different nations}}

===Prohibitions===
Cryptography has long been of interest to intelligence gathering and [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]].&lt;ref name="RangerSteve1"/&gt; Secret communications may be criminal or even [[treason]]ous {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;!--it is not clear how secure communication might be construed as treason--&gt;. Because of its facilitation of [[privacy]], and the diminution of privacy attendant on its prohibition, cryptography is also of considerable interest to civil rights supporters. Accordingly, there has been a history of controversial legal issues surrounding cryptography, especially since the advent of inexpensive computers has made widespread access to high quality cryptography possible.

In some countries, even the domestic use of cryptography is, or has been, restricted. Until 1999, [[France]] significantly restricted the use of cryptography domestically, though it has since relaxed many of these rules. In [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Islamic Republic of Iran|Iran]], a license is still required to use cryptography.&lt;ref name="cryptolaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cryptolaw.org/cls2.htm |title=Overview per country|website=Crypto Law Survey|date=February 2013|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries have tight restrictions on the use of cryptography. Among the more restrictive are laws in [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Pakistan]], [[Singapore]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emc.com/emc-plus/rsa-labs/standards-initiatives/cryptographic-policies-countries.htm|title=6.5.1 What Are the Cryptographic Policies of Some Countries?|publisher=[[RSA Laboratories]]|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], cryptography is legal for domestic use, but there has been much conflict over legal issues related to cryptography.&lt;ref name="RangerSteve1"/&gt; One particularly important issue has been the [[export of cryptography]] and cryptographic software and hardware. Probably because of the importance of cryptanalysis in [[World War II]] and an expectation that cryptography would continue to be important for national security, many Western governments have, at some point, strictly regulated export of cryptography. After World War II, it was illegal in the US to sell or distribute encryption technology overseas; in fact, encryption was designated as auxiliary military equipment and put on the [[United States Munitions List]].&lt;ref name="cyberlaw"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cryptography &amp; Speech|last=Rosenoer|first=Jonathan|website=CyberLaw|date=1995}}&lt;br /&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201184530/http://www.cyberlaw.com/cylw1095.html |date=1 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the development of the [[personal computer]], asymmetric key algorithms (i.e., public key techniques), and the [[Internet]], this was not especially problematic. However, as the Internet grew and computers became more widely available, high-quality encryption techniques became well known around the globe.

===Export controls===
{{Main|Export of cryptography}}
In the 1990s, there were several challenges to US export regulation of cryptography. After the [[source code]] for [[Philip Zimmermann]]'s [[Pretty Good Privacy]] (PGP) encryption program found its way onto the Internet in June 1991, a complaint by [[RSA Security]] (then called RSA Data Security, Inc.) resulted in a lengthy criminal investigation of Zimmermann by the US Customs Service and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], though no charges were ever filed.&lt;ref name="zim"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ieee-security.org/Cipher/Newsbriefs/1996/960214.zimmerman.html|title=Case Closed on Zimmermann PGP Investigation|website=[[IEEE Computer Society]]'s Technical Committee on Security and Privacy|date=14 February 1996|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="levybook"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Levy |title=Crypto: How the Code Rebels Beat the Government—Saving Privacy in the Digital Age |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2001 |isbn=978-0140244328 |page=56 |oclc=244148644}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel J. Bernstein]], then a graduate student at [[UC Berkeley]], brought a lawsuit against the US government challenging some aspects of the restrictions based on [[1st Amendment|free speech]] grounds. The 1995 case [[Bernstein v. United States]] ultimately resulted in a 1999 decision that printed source code for cryptographic algorithms and systems was protected as [[freedom of speech|free speech]] by the United States Constitution.&lt;ref name="b v us"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bernstein v USDOJ|url=http://www.epic.org/crypto/export_controls/bernstein_decision_9_cir.html|publisher=[[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]|website=[[Electronic Privacy Information Center]]|date=6 May 1999|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, thirty-nine countries signed the [[Wassenaar Arrangement]], an arms control treaty that deals with the export of arms and "dual-use" technologies such as cryptography. The treaty stipulated that the use of cryptography with short key-lengths (56-bit for symmetric encryption, 512-bit for RSA) would no longer be export-controlled.&lt;ref name="wa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulations-docs/445-category-5-part-2-information-security/file|format=PDF|title=Dual-use List – Category 5 – Part 2 – "Information Security"|website=[[Wassenaar Arrangement]]|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryptography exports from the US became less strictly regulated as a consequence of a major relaxation in 2000;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=.4 United States Cryptography Export/Import Laws|website=[[RSA Laboratories]]|url=http://www.emc.com/emc-plus/rsa-labs/standards-initiatives/united-states-cryptography-export-import.htm|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are no longer very many restrictions on key sizes in US-[[Export of cryptography|exported]] mass-market software. Since this relaxation in US export restrictions, and because most personal computers connected to the [[Internet]] include US-sourced [[web browser]]s such as [[Firefox]] or [[Internet Explorer]], almost every Internet user worldwide has potential access to quality cryptography via their browsers (e.g., via [[Transport Layer Security]]). The [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] and [[Microsoft Outlook]] [[E-mail client]] programs similarly can transmit and receive emails via TLS, and can send and receive email encrypted with [[S/MIME]]. Many Internet users don't realize that their basic application software contains such extensive [[cryptosystem]]s. These browsers and email programs are so ubiquitous that even governments whose intent is to regulate civilian use of cryptography generally don't find it practical to do much to control distribution or use of cryptography of this quality, so even when such laws are in force, actual enforcement is often effectively impossible.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===NSA involvement===
[[File:National Security Agency headquarters, Fort Meade, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland]]
{{See also|Clipper chip}}
Another contentious issue connected to cryptography in the United States is the influence of the [[National Security Agency]] on cipher development and policy.&lt;ref name="RangerSteve1"/&gt; The NSA was involved with the design of [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] during its development at [[IBM]] and its consideration by the [[National Bureau of Standards]] as a possible Federal Standard for cryptography.&lt;ref name="cryptogram"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0006.html#DES|title=The Data Encryption Standard (DES)|authorlink=Bruce Schneier|first=Bruce|last=Schneier|website=Crypto-Gram|date=15 June 2000|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; DES was designed to be resistant to [[differential cryptanalysis]],&lt;ref name="coppersmith-des"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Coppersmith| first = D.|date=May 1994| title = The Data Encryption Standard (DES) and its strength against attacks| journal = IBM Journal of Research and Development| volume = 38| issue = 3| pages = 243–250| url = http://domino.watson.ibm.com/tchjr/journalindex.nsf/0/94f78816c77fc77885256bfa0067fb98?OpenDocument| format = PDF| doi = 10.1147/rd.383.0243|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a powerful and general cryptanalytic technique known to the NSA and IBM, that became publicly known only when it was rediscovered in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authorlink=Eli Biham|first=E.|last=Biham|first2=A.|last2=Shamir|url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/K54H077NP8714058.pdf|format=PDF|title=Differential cryptanalysis of DES-like cryptosystems|journal=Journal of Cryptology|volume=4|number=1|pages=3–72|year=1991|accessdate=26 March 2015|doi=10.1007/bf00630563}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Steven Levy]], IBM discovered differential cryptanalysis,&lt;ref name="levybook"/&gt; but kept the technique secret at the NSA's request. The technique became publicly known only when Biham and Shamir re-discovered and announced it some years later. The entire affair illustrates the difficulty of determining what resources and knowledge an attacker might actually have.

Another instance of the NSA's involvement was the 1993 [[Clipper chip]] affair, an encryption microchip intended to be part of the [[Capstone (cryptography)|Capstone]] cryptography-control initiative. Clipper was widely criticized by cryptographers for two reasons. The cipher algorithm (called [[Skipjack (cipher)|Skipjack]]) was then classified (declassified in 1998, long after the Clipper initiative lapsed). The classified cipher caused concerns that the NSA had deliberately made the cipher weak in order to assist its intelligence efforts. The whole initiative was also criticized based on its violation of [[Kerckhoffs's Principle]], as the scheme included a special [[key escrow|escrow key]] held by the government for use by law enforcement, for example in wiretaps.&lt;ref name="levybook"/&gt;

===Digital rights management===
{{Main|Digital rights management}}
Cryptography is central to digital rights management (DRM), a group of techniques for technologically controlling use of [[copyright]]ed material, being widely implemented and deployed at the behest of some copyright holders. In 1998, [[U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] signed the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), which criminalized all production, dissemination, and use of certain cryptanalytic techniques and technology (now known or later discovered); specifically, those that could be used to circumvent DRM technological schemes.&lt;ref name="DMCA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf |title=The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 |format=PDF |website=[[United States Copyright Office]]|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had a noticeable impact on the cryptography research community since an argument can be made that ''any'' cryptanalytic research violated, or might violate, the DMCA. Similar statutes have since been enacted in several countries and regions, including the implementation in the [[Directive on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society|EU Copyright Directive]]. Similar restrictions are called for by treaties signed by [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] member-states.

The [[United States Department of Justice]] and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] have not enforced the DMCA as rigorously as had been feared by some, but the law, nonetheless, remains a controversial one. [[Niels Ferguson]], a well-respected cryptography researcher, has publicly stated that he will not release some of his research into an [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] security design for fear of prosecution under the DMCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Censorship in action: why I don't publish my HDCP results|last=Ferguson|first=Niels|date=15 August 2001}}&lt;br /&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011201184919/http://www.macfergus.com/niels/dmca/cia.html |date=1 December 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryptanalyst [[Bruce Schneier]] has argued that the DMCA encourages [[vendor lock-in]], while inhibiting actual measures toward cyber-security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2001/08/arrest_of_computer_r.html |title=Arrest of Computer Researcher Is Arrest of First Amendment Rights |last=Schneier |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Schneier |publisher=InternetWeek |date=2001-08-06 |accessdate=2017-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Alan Cox]] (longtime [[Linux kernel]] developer) and [[Edward Felten]] (and some of his students at Princeton) have encountered problems related to the Act. [[Dmitry Sklyarov]] was arrested during a visit to the US from Russia, and jailed for five months pending trial for alleged violations of the DMCA arising from work he had done in Russia, where the work was legal. In 2007, the cryptographic keys responsible for [[Blu-ray]] and [[HD DVD]] content scrambling were [[AACS encryption key controversy|discovered and released onto the Internet]]. In both cases, the [[MPAA]] sent out numerous DMCA takedown notices, and there was a massive Internet backlash&lt;ref name="AACS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2007/05/02/digg-users-revolt-ov.html|title=Digg users revolt over AACS key|accessdate=26 March 2015|date=2 May 2007|first=Cory|last=Doctorow|website=[[Boing Boing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; triggered by the perceived impact of such notices on [[fair use]] and [[free speech]].

===Forced disclosure of encryption keys===
{{Main|Key disclosure law}}
In the United Kingdom, the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000|Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]] gives UK police the powers to force suspects to decrypt files or hand over passwords that protect encryption keys. Failure to comply is an offense in its own right, punishable on conviction by a two-year jail sentence or up to five years in cases involving national security.&lt;ref name="UK law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/137881/uk_data_encryption_disclosure_law_takes_effect.html |title=UK Data Encryption Disclosure Law Takes Effect |website=[[PC World]] |date=1 October 2007 |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful prosecutions have occurred under the Act; the first, in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/11/ripa_iii_figures/ |title=Two convicted for refusal to decrypt data|first=Christopher|last=Williams |website=[[The Register]] |date=11 August 2009|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in a term of 13 months' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/24/ripa_jfl/ |title=UK jails schizophrenic for refusal to decrypt files|first=Christopher|last=Williams |website=[[The Register]] |date=24 November 2009 |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar forced disclosure laws in Australia, Finland, France, and India compel individual suspects under investigation to hand over encryption keys or passwords during a criminal investigation.

In the United States, the federal criminal case of [[United States v. Fricosu]] addressed whether a search warrant can compel a person to reveal an [[encryption]] [[passphrase]] or password.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_19669803 |title=Password case reframes Fifth Amendment rights in context of digital world |newspaper=[[The Denver Post]] |date=January 4, 2012 |first=John |last=Ingold |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) argued that this is a violation of the protection from self-incrimination given by the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leyden |first=John |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/07/13/eff_piles_in_against_forced_decryption/ |title=US court test for rights not to hand over crypto keys |website=[[The Register]] |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the court ruled that under the [[All Writs Act]], the defendant was required to produce an unencrypted hard drive for the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Order Granting Application under the All Writs Act Requiring Defendant Fricosu to Assist in the Execution of Previously Issued Search Warrants|publisher=[[United States District Court for the District of Colorado]]|url=https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2012/01/decrypt.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many jurisdictions, the legal status of forced disclosure remains unclear.

The 2016 [[FBI–Apple encryption dispute]] concerns the ability of courts in the United States to compel manufacturers' assistance in unlocking cell phones whose contents are cryptographically protected.

As a potential counter-measure to forced disclosure some cryptographic software supports [[plausible deniability]], where the encrypted data is indistinguishable from unused random data (for example such as that of a [[Data remanence|drive which has been securely wiped]]).

Many features of the DNA double helix contribute to its large stiffness, including the mechanical properties of the sugar-phosphate backbone, electrostatic repulsion between [[phosphate]]s (DNA bears on average one elementary negative charge per each 0.17&amp;nbsp;nm of the [[double helix]]), stacking interactions between the bases of each individual strand, and strand-strand interactions. DNA is one of the stiffest natural polymers, yet it is also one of the longest molecules. This means that at large distances DNA can be considered as a flexible rope, and on a short scale as a stiff rod. Like a garden hose, unpacked DNA would randomly occupy a much larger volume than when it is orderly packed. Mathematically, for a non-interacting flexible chain randomly diffusing in 3D, the end-to-end distance would scale as a square root of the polymer length. For real polymers such as DNA, this gives only a very rough estimate; what is important, is that the space available for the DNA ''in vivo'' is much smaller than the space that it would occupy in the case of a free diffusion in the solution. To cope with volume constraints, DNA can pack itself in the appropriate solution conditions with the help of ions and other molecules. Usually, DNA condensation is defined as "the collapse of extended DNA chains into compact, orderly particles containing only one or a few molecules".&lt;ref name="Bloomfield'97"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bloomfield |first= VA|year=1997 |pages=269–82 |title=DNA condensation by multivalent cations |volume=44 |journal=Biopolymers | doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0282(1997)44:3&lt;269::AID-BIP6&gt;3.0.CO;2-T |issue=3 |pmid=9591479 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition applies to many situations in vitro and is also close to the definition of DNA condensation in bacteria as "adoption of relatively concentrated, compact state occupying a fraction of the volume available".&lt;ref name="Zimmerman&amp;Murphy'96"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zimmerman |first1= SB |last2= Murphy |first2= LD|year=1996 |pages=245–8 |title=Macromolecular crowding and the mandatory condensation of DNA in bacteria |volume=390 |journal=FEBS Letters| doi=10.1016/0014-5793(96)00725-9 |issue=3 |pmid=8706869}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[eukaryotes]], the DNA size and the number of other participating players are much larger, and a DNA molecule forms millions of ordered [[nucleoprotein]] particles, the [[nucleosome]]s, which is just the first of many levels of DNA packing.&lt;ref name="Teif" /&gt;

== DNA condensation in viruses ==
In [[virus]]es and [[bacteriophage]]s, the DNA or RNA is surrounded by a protein [[capsid]], sometimes further enveloped by a lipid [[membrane]]. Double-stranded DNA is stored inside the capsid in the form of a spool, which can have different types of coiling leading to different types of [[liquid crystal|liquid-crystalline]] packing. This packing can change from [[hexagonal]] to [[cholesteric]] to [[isotropic]] at different stages of the phage functioning. Although the double helices are always locally aligned, the DNA inside viruses does not represent real [[liquid crystals]], because it lacks fluidity. On the other hand,  DNA condensed ''in vitro'', e.g., with the help of polyamines also present in viruses, is both locally ordered and fluid.&lt;ref name="Teif" /&gt;

== DNA condensation in bacteria ==
Bacterial DNA is packed with the help of [[polyamines]] and proteins. Protein-associated DNA occupies about 1/4 of the intracellular volume forming a concentrated viscous phase with liquid crystalline properties, called the nucleoid. Similar DNA packaging exists also in [[chloroplast]]s and [[mitochondria]]. Bacterial DNA is sometimes referred to as the [[bacterial chromosome]]. Bacterial nucleoid evolutionary represents an intermediate engineering solution between the protein-free DNA packing in viruses and protein-determined packing in eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="Teif" /&gt;

[[Sister chromatids|Sister chromosomes]] in the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' are induced by stressful conditions to condense and undergo pairing.&lt;ref name="pmid23884460"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shechter N, Zaltzman L, Weiner A, Brumfeld V, Shimoni E, Fridmann-Sirkis Y, Minsky A |title=Stress-induced condensation of bacterial genomes results in re-pairing of sister chromosomes: implications for double strand DNA break repair |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=288 |issue=35 |pages=25659–67 |year=2013 |pmid=23884460 |pmc=3757227 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M113.473025 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stress-induced condensation occurs by a non-random, zipper-like convergence of sister chromosomes.  This convergence appears to depend on the ability of identical double-stranded [[DNA]] molecules to specifically identify each other, a process that culminates in the proximity of homologous sites along the paired chromosomes.  Diverse stress conditions appear to prime bacteria to effectively cope with severe [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damages]] such as double-strand breaks.  The apposition of homologous sites associated with stress-induced chromosome condensation helps explain how repair of double-strand breaks and other damages occurs.&lt;ref name="pmid23884460" /&gt;

== DNA condensation in eukaryotes ==
[[File:Chromatin chromosome.png|thumb|Different levels of DNA condensation in eukaryotes. (1) Single DNA strand. (2) [[Chromatin]] strand (DNA with histones). (3) Chromatin during [[interphase]] with [[centromere]]. (4) Two copies of condensed chromatin together during [[prophase]]. (5) Chromosome during [[metaphase]].]]
Eukaryotic DNA with a typical length of dozens of centimeters should be orderly packed to be readily accessible inside the micrometer-size nucleus. In unicellular eukaryotes known as [[dinoflagellates]], it is possible to distinguish liquid-crystalline chromosomal ordering,&lt;ref name="Chow"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= MH |last1= Chow |first2= KTH |last2= Yan |first3= MJ |last3= Bennett |first4= JTY |last4= Wong |year=2010 |pages=1577–87 |title=Birefringence and DNA condensation of liquid crystalline chromosomes  |volume=9 |journal=[[Eukaryotic Cell (journal)|Eukaryotic Cell]] | doi=10.1128/EC.00026-10 |issue=10 |pmc=2950428 |pmid=20400466}}&lt;/ref&gt; that they do not contain easily detectable histones, until recently it was thought that they were completely absent and that dinoflagellates were mesokaryotic though this is no longer the case and they are now classified as alveolates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4751559 | pmid=26646152 | doi=10.1534/g3.115.023275 | volume=6 | title=Diversity and Divergence of Dinoflagellate Histone Proteins | author=Marinov GK, Lynch M | journal=G3 (Bethesda) | pages=397–422}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other eukaryotes, DNA is arranged in the cell nucleus with the help of histones. In this case, the basic level of DNA compaction is the nucleosome, where the double helix is wrapped around the histone octamer containing two copies of each [[histone]] [[histone H2A|H2A]], [[histone H2B|H2B]], [[histone H3|H3]] and [[histone H4|H4]]. Linker [[histone H1]] binds the DNA between nucleosomes and facilitates packaging of the 10&amp;nbsp;nm "beads on the string" nucleosomal chain into a more condensed 30&amp;nbsp;nm fiber. Most of the time, between cell divisions, [[chromatin]] is optimized to allow easy access of transcription factors to active [[genes]], which are characterized by a less compact structure called [[euchromatin]], and to alleviate protein access in more tightly packed regions called [[heterochromatin]]. During the cell division, chromatin compaction increases even more to form [[chromosome]]s, which can cope with large mechanical forces dragging them into each of the two daughter cells.&lt;ref name="Teif" /&gt;

== DNA condensation ''in vitro'' ==
DNA condensation can be induced ''in vitro'' either by applying external force to bring the double helices together, or by inducing attractive interactions between the DNA segments. The former can be achieved e.g. with the help of the osmotic pressure exerted by crowding neutral polymers in the presence of monovalent salts. In this case, the forces pushing the double helices together are coming from entropic random collisions with the crowding polymers surrounding DNA condensates, and salt is required to neutralize DNA charges and decrease DNA-DNA repulsion. The second possibility can be realized by inducing attractive interactions between the DNA segments by multivalent cationic charged ligands (multivalent [[metal ions]], inorganic [[cations]], [[polyamines]], [[protamines]], [[peptides]], [[lipids]], [[liposomes]] and [[proteins]]).&lt;ref name="Teif" /&gt;

== Physics of DNA condensation ==
Condensation of long double-helical DNAs is a sharp [[phase transition]], which takes place within a narrow interval of condensing agent concentrations.[ref] Since the double helices come very closely to each other in the condensed phase, this leads to the restructuring of water molecules, which gives rise to the so-called [[hydration forces]].[ref] To understand attraction between negatively charged DNA molecules, one also must account for [[counterion correlation|correlations]] between counterions in the solution.[ref] DNA condensation by proteins can exhibit hysteresis, which can be explained using a modified [[Ising model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vtyurina|first=Natalia N.|last2=Dulin|first2=David|last3=Docter|first3=Margreet W.|last4=Meyer|first4=Anne S.|last5=Dekker|first5=Nynke H.|last6=Abbondanzieri|first6=Elio A.|date=2016-04-18|title=Hysteresis in DNA compaction by Dps is described by an Ising model|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/04/14/1521241113|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|pages=201521241|doi=10.1073/pnas.1521241113|issn=0027-8424|pmid=27091987|volume=113|bibcode=2016PNAS..113.4982V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DNA condensation and gene regulation ==
Nowadays descriptions of gene regulation are based on the approximations of [[equilibrium binding]] in [[dilute solution]]s, although it is clear that these assumptions are in fact violated in [[chromatin]]. The dilute-solution approximation is violated for two reasons. First, the chromatin content is far from being dilute, and second, the numbers of the participating molecules are sometimes so small, that it does not make sense to talk about the bulk concentrations. Further differences from dilute solutions arise due to the different binding affinities of proteins to condensed and uncondensed DNA. Thus in condensed DNA both the reaction rates can be changed and their dependence on the concentrations of reactants may become nonlinear.&lt;ref name="Teif" /&gt;

==The book==
The subjects covered by Piero della Francesca in these writings include [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]] and innovative work in both [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]].&lt;ref name=D&gt;[http://www.codicesillustres.com/catalogue/de_prospectiva_pingendi/], Codices Illustres&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E/&gt;

The script consists of three parts:

* Part One ''Disegno'', describing techniques for painting faces
* Part Two ''Commensurazio'', describing perspectives
* Part Three ''Coloro'', describing techniques for creating perspectives by using colours

==History==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

''De Prospectiva Pingendi'' was probably created in the years between 1474 until 1482.&lt;ref name=B&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit13/unit13.html#Francesca], Dartmouth College&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=A&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428630/On-Perspective-in-Painting], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E/&gt;

The writings were inspired by the book ''[[De pictura]]'' by [[Leon Battista Alberti]]&lt;ref name=A/&gt; written in 1435&lt;ref name=B/&gt; but probably also by works by [[Euclid]].&lt;ref name=E&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emsh.calarts.edu/alumni/bkeresey/pier.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329120658/http://emsh.calarts.edu/alumni/bkeresey/pier.html |archivedate=2010-03-29 |df= }}, Computer Animation Lab&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript later came into the possession of the [[Biblioteca Palatina]] in [[Parma]]&lt;ref name=E/&gt; before it was transferred to the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]].

Much of Piero’s work was later absorbed into the writing of others, notably [[Luca Pacioli]]. Piero’s work on solid geometry appears in Pacioli’s ''[[De divina proportione]]'', a work illustrated by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

In 1899 the writings were first published in bookform.&lt;ref name=C&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bnh3FKIKT9AC&amp;pg=PA606&amp;lpg=PA606&amp;dq=De+prospectiva+pingendi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=44K40GH0dO&amp;sig=TW1qcfzitd7mGdpO-mIdCIl3FAw&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=l4DBS43YHOGkOKGZ5JYE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=De%20prospectiva%20pingendi&amp;f=false], Google Books.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[public administration]] [[debate]] about [[New Public Management]] (NPM), the concept of '''digital era governance''' (or '''DEG''') is claimed by [[Patrick Dunleavy]], [[Helen Margetts]] and their co-authors as replacing NPM since around 2000-05. DEG has three key elements: reintegration (bringing issues back into government control, like US airport security after 9/11); needs-based holism (reorganizing government around distinct client groups); and [[digitizing|digitization]] (fully exploiting the potential of digital storage and Internet communications to transform governance).

'''Directive Communication Psychology''' (DC) is a [[training]] and [[organization development|organisational development]] [[psychology]] developed by [[Arthur F. Carmazzi]] that reveals how people act and react in groups while providing a structure for the influence of those groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://directivecommunication.net/directive-communication-psychology/|title=Fear|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citehr.com/283867-directive-communication-psychology-developing-positive-traits-employees.html|title=Directive Communication Psychology: Developing Positive Traits In The Employees  - CiteHR|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Colored-Brain-Communication-Field-Manual/dp/1442126205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aiobp.org/organization/directive-communication-international/|title=Directive Communication International - AIOBP|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name, "''Directive Communication''", refers to the idea that communication is constant, and, is constantly causing and effecting the individuals and groups involved whether it is verbal or non-verbal. Therefore, understanding the psychological element and derived models of how these cause and effects come about, allows a person to consciously "Direct" his communication to achieve a purposeful and desired effect in group behavior.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carmazzi.net"&gt;http://carmazzi.net/pdf_files/Organizational%20Development%20with%20DC%20psychology%20to%20enhance%20the%20workforce%20and%20develop%2&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The discipline was founded in 2001 when Carmazzi found himself working in a dysfunctional organisation and performing at levels far below his own aptitude. While he was underperforming at work, he found himself to be innovative and perform well with his friends on various projects. He also found that different groups of friends brought out different facets of his attitude and personality, some being positive and others not. His findings were later published as he discovered that an individual’s performance was directly related to the unique group environment he or she was in. The initial work showed some people performed extremely well in one environment and, even with the same requirements, performed poorly in others. The group dynamics studies led the development of the 6 primary models that Carmazzi identified as foundations to understand how different mixes of individuals affect performance differently. The models supported individuals within a group to influence the dynamics and performance of that group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

One of the studies identified how a high achiever was put into a high performing team and the entire team began to perform poorly. In the same study, certain average achievers were combined and created high performing teams.&lt;ref name="directivecommunication.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://directivecommunication.net/team-motivation-connection-clusters|title=Team Motivation Clusters|date=9 April 2014|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="directivecommunication.net"/&gt; In 2007, the methodology was accredited by the American Institute of Business Psychology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

DC Psychology continues to be an expanding discipline with many contributors to the methodology including Lily C. Lau, Dr Raymond Phoon, Dr Leslie Choudhury, Waheed Albalushi, Col. Aalok Soodm Prachla Malhotra and Dr Marine Milad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/11145296/ESTABLISHING_A_BLENDED_LEARNING_ENVIRONMENT_ACCOMMODATING_DIFFERENT_BRAIN_COLOURS_AND_MULTIPLE_INTELLIGENCES|title=ESTABLISHING A BLENDED LEARNING ENVIRONMENT ACCOMMODATING DIFFERENT BRAIN COLOURS AND MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES|first=Marine|last=Milad|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
Directive Communication Psychology is the science of group dynamics. it identifies How and Why people act and react in groups, and the small modifications in behavior that leads to influencing those groups. Directive Communication became the science of organisational peak performance and was commercially applied to developing leadership, improving [[Organizational culture|corporate culture]], [[Team building|Team Development]], workforce enhancement and [[Group dynamics|group behavior modification]], and in high yield training and development. In a non-commercial environment, Directive Communication serves to cultivate better personal relationships, raising children, and becoming more fulfilled and responsible citizens.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

There are 307 Directive Communication certified trainers in 16 different countries including Iran, Pakistan, France, Malaysia, Singapore, Hungary, Bahrain, Qatar, China, UAE and Indonesia among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trainthetrainer.asia/train-the-trainer-enrollment/|title=Train the trainer course by Arthur Carmazzi|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Colored Brain - How an individual genetically interprets information and surroundings, gets clarity on solutions, ideas and processes, and, sequencesaction from or through that clarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coloredbrain.com|title=Psychometric Test for Effective Communication with Colored Brain|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Emotional Drive – a set of 8 primary motivators that determine why people take or do not take action and why they react to people and environments in ways that either support or do not support their objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emotionaldrive.net|title=Homepage - HDMA|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Postures – a [[yoga]] based, mind/body connection model that supports the immediate and purposeful creation of mood in an individual to affect environment.
*Directive Questions – a questioning model to take the place of direct instruction in order to connect motivation, develop competence and increase trust and respect within teams.
*Core Identity – a process by which individuals find and nurture their own models of leadership, personal effectiveness and objective supporting attitudes by harnessing facets of who they are at their best in different environments. The model is said to enhance sustainability of new behaviors because in essence, they are not new and simply refined and redirected existing behaviors.

==Organizational culture change model==
The directive communication organizational change model is a bottom up process that was originally derived from the US Special forces and CIA force multiplication and revolution models. The objective of the model is to develop a more effective and engaged organizational culture through uniting the people within the organization to create an environment that supports their personal success and value through the organization, and therefore increasing engagement. It assumes the following points:

*It is easier for the masses to get buy-in from a small group of leaders than it is for a small group of leaders to get buy-in from the masses.
*Groups with a single greater purpose unite to achieve it.
*There are key influencers within an organization that people listen to and respect even if they do not have official titles. These people can influence their peers through trust that may be missing from the employee/management relationship.
*People, regardless of culture, age, position or education have very similar ideas about what is an ideal work environment. (this is based on an [[Arthur Carmazzi]] study conducted over 51 different countries and over 80,000 people determining the fundamental 5 consistent elements that subjects have defined as required for the ideal work environment).
*If there is a common enemy, groups that normally do not associate, will come together to fight against it.
*Ownership of the culture supports perpetuation of it. Employees may not own the company but they can own the culture. A culture initiative must separate the 2 for sustainability.
*In the instant information and gratification society we live in, if people do not see fast results that are supporting their success, they will lose interest and the initiative will get lost in the shuffle of being busy. A successful culture change initiative must show visible results in the first week of implementation to maintain ignite the motivation to continue.
*If given the opportunity, people want to solve the problems that are preventing them from becoming more successful at work. 
*A common language that supports emotional communication without conflict, supports the creation of an ideal working environment 
*The directive communication psychology and it intrinsic language supports the unification of people to achieve the greater common purpose of creating an ideal work environment and show visible results in a short time.

The culture change process has 4 criteria for it to work and be sustainable.

*Senior management must be involved.
*There will be a 2-week period where operations will be disrupted. 
*There may be negative influencers that must be removed from the organization or interaction with the majority of the staff. 
*The initiative only works with up to 1200 people at one time.

==Assumptions of Directive Communication Psychology==
Directive communication psychology has the following assumptions:&lt;ref name="carmazzi.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culture-dynamics.com/main/3180/index.asp?pageid=162466&amp;t=directive-communication-psychology-trainer-certification&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesliechoudhury.com/index.php/directive-communication-psychology|title=Directive Communication Psychology|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/directive-communication-psychology-lenaghaz-lenaghaz-energylab|title=Directive Communication Psychology|date=16 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Individuals have potential to be inspired or uninspired at any given time, depending on their environment and their focus 
*Reactions to environment take place in the reptilian brain, and are a product of violated assumptions about the way that things should be 
*The reptilian brain does not reason and therefore reactions are “non-intelligent” actions 
*By understanding the psychology of how and why people act and react to each other in groups, an individual can change one consistent behavior in an environment, and affect the entire environment. 
*The subconscious actions based on assumptions about the way that people should be, manifest the way others treat them 
*Because of these subconscious actions, Everyone is personally responsible for the way others treat them and the creation of their own environment 
*“Personality” cannot be defined or categorized, it can only be “interpreted” by understanding the 3 separate components of character: the Mental, the Emotional, and the Physical 
*Each person Mentally processes the world around them based on a genetic brain processing, and While we cannot change our genetic processors, we learn “software” to compensate 
*Our Emotional Motivations are driven by eight primary emotional drivers, these are products of our environment and are subject to change over time 
*We have habitual physical postures that affect our focus, attitudes and the way our environment interacts with us.

==Training tools and assessments==
Directive communication psychology training focuses with the idea that learning retention and implementation could be improved with what founder, Arthur Carmazzi, calls “stacked learning”. Using sets of proprietary training tools developed by Carmazzi, a directive communication-based training game incorporates real world context into a specific learning point, the next learning point and game reinforces the earlier one and so on. Each game or exercise for new learning is “stacked” on, and emphasizes each previous learning.
 
This has led to further development of reflective tools such as the Colored Brain Communication Cards: a series of 54 images that, when put in context of a question, elicit subconscious values, lost knowledge, and expanded clarity about the question.

The methodology and tools expand from contributions from its certified trainers and practitioners such as The Choudhury Mind Maze Developed by Dr. Leslie Choudhury that emphasizes 5 out of the 6 Directive Communication models.

The Directive Communication assessments are also related to the various games.

*The Colored Brain Communication Inventory (CBCI) determines the Colored Brain or specific genetic process for getting clarity of a user.
*The Human Drive Mirrored Assessment (HDMA) identifies the “perception gaps” of how an individual sees themselves compared to how they are seen be subordinates, peers and superiors 
*The Corporate Culture Evolution Evaluation (CCEE) determining at which of the five levels of organizational culture (according to Carmazzi’s Culture Model) an organization’s culture is at.

Assessments are also subject to expansion from the Directive Communication community with contributions to accuracy and further application. One contribution by Lily C. Lau expanded the practicality of the Colored Brain assessment by adding depth to the application of “the second color” with her own research in 2013.

==Applications==
* Leadership
* Team effectiveness
* Engagement 
* Organizational culture enhancement and change
* Sales and marketing
* Customer service
* Training and learning effectivness

==Certification, and practitioner standards==
There are two maincertifications, “trainer” and “practitioner”. Additional certifications such as culture change, gamification, and master trainer,must have a minimum trainer certification before they can be attained. As an accredited methodology from the American Institute of Business Psychology, the Directive Communication psychology trainer certification is subject to two examinations. A practical examination where no more than 3 out of 50 questions can be missed for a passing grade, and a practical for the psychology based delivery methods related to training and increasing retention and implementation of concepts. Trainer certifications can only be delivered and certified by official Directive Communication Certified Master Trainers.

The practitioner certification is available live by certified Directive Communication master trainers and in online format. It is a prerequisite for the trainer certification. The practitioner certification requires only passing a written test with 20 questions per module and cannot miss more than 2 out of 20. The test is taken online.

It was created in 2009 and developed by ESA according to agreements between the agency and the United Kingdom in 2012. About 100 ESA employees were expected to work in Harwell by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://fr.scribd.com/doc/261462085/Plans-for-ECSAT-ESA-in-Harwell | title = Plans for ECSAT - ESA in Harwell | publisher = [[European Space Agency]] | date = 5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would support activities linking space to telecommunications, integrated applications, climate change, technology and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://fr.scribd.com/doc/261462073/ECSAT-Achievements-and-Perspectives | title = ECSAT Achievements and Perspectives | publisher = European Space Agency | date = 4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new ESA-only building, which would include advanced concepts on sustainability and use of natural energy sources, would be constructed on the campus.

The development of ECSAT was in line with the growing efforts of the United Kingdom in the space sector, including the creation of the [[UK Space Agency]]  in 2010 and the increase in the economic contribution of that country to the ESA. At the same time, the ESA benefited from a closer relation with the UK space sector and corrected an historical anomaly whereby the United Kingdom, while being one of the biggest ESA contributors, did not host any of the agency’s major centers.

There is an earlier ESA facility on the campus, the ESA Business Incubation Centre (BIC) Harwell, which is intended to assist in the development of technology transfer ideas, helping to transform them into viable businesses.

ECSAT hosts the ESA Climate Office, responsible for defining and implementing ESA's Climate Change Initiative Programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cci.esa.int | title = Climate Change Initiative | publisher = European Space Agency | date = 29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''fixed stars''' ({{lang-la|stellae fixae}}) comprise the background of [[astronomical object]]s that appear to not move relative to each other in the [[night sky]] compared to the foreground of [[Solar System object]]s that do. Generally, the fixed stars are taken to include all [[star]]s other than the [[Sun]]. [[Nebula]]e and other [[deep-sky object]]s may also be counted among the fixed stars.

Exact delimitation of the term is complicated by the fact that no celestial objects are in fact fixed with respect to each other. Nonetheless, [[extrasolar objects]] move so slowly in the sky that the change in their relative positions is nearly imperceptible on typical human timescales, except to careful examination, and thus can be considered "fixed" for many purposes. Furthermore, distant stars and [[galaxies]] move even
slower in the sky than comparatively closer ones.

People in many cultures have imagined that the stars form pictures in the sky called [[constellation]]s. In [[Ancient Greek astronomy]], the fixed stars were believed to exist on a giant [[Celestial spheres|celestial sphere]], or [[firmament]], that revolves daily around Earth.

==Origin of name==

The attempts to explain the universe stem from observations of the objects found in the sky. Different cultures historically have various stories to provide an answer to the questions of what they are seeing. [[Norse Mythology]] originates from eastern Europe, around the geographical location of modern-day region of [[Scandinavia]] and Northern [[Germany]]. The Norse mythology consists of tales and myths derived from [[Old Norse]], which was a Northern German language from the [[Middle Ages]]. There is a series of manuscript texts written in Old Norse which contain a collection of [35] poems written from oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/elderorpoeticedd01brayuoft/page/n9|title=The Elder or Poetic Edda; commonly known as Saemund's Edda. Edited and translated with introd. and notes by Oliver Bray. Illustrated by W.G. Collingwood|last1=Bray|first1=Oliver|date=1908|publisher=London Printed for the Viking Club|edition=1|location=archive.org|accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among historians there seems to be speculation of the specific dates of the poems written, however, the estimated record of the texts is around the beginning of the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KlT7tv3eMSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Norse Mythology: A Guide to Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs|last1=Lindow|first1=John|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=books.google.com|accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the oral tradition of passing down tales existed long before the advent of text manuscripts and print versions.

Among surviving texts there is mention of the mythological god, [[Odin]]. Scholars have recounted the tale of the Αesir Gods creation myth which includes the idea of fixed stars found within the teleology of the tale. Padaric Colum has written a book, ''The Children of Odin'', which in much detail reiterates the story of how the Aesir god’s brought the giant named [[Ymir]] to his demise and created the world from his body, affixing sparks from the fiery [[Muspelheim]], or the ''fixed stars,'' to the dome of the sky, which was the skull of Ymir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=www.gutenberg.org/files/24737/24737-h/24737-h.htm|title=The Children of Odin: The Book of Nothern Myths|last1=Colum|first1=Padaric|date=March 2, 2008|publisher=Gutenberg Project eBook|location=Guternberg Project|pages=62-69|accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Norse creation myth is one of several cases which treated stars as being fixed to a sphere beyond the earth. Later scientific literature shows astronomical thought which kept a version of this idea until the seventeenth century.

== Developing Western Astronomy ==
[[File:Copernicus's image of planetary system (1543).tif|thumb|Copernicus, Nicolaus. ''On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres''. Nuremberg. 1543. Print copy of Copernicus’s work showing the model of the universe with the sun in the center and a sphere of “immobile stars” on the outside according to his theory of the cosmos. Shared with permission of the University of Oklahoma History of Science Collections.]]
Western astronomical knowledge was based on the traditional thoughts from philosophical and observational inquiries of [[Greek Antiquity]]. Other cultures contributed to thought about the fixed stars including the Babylonian’s, who from the eighteenth to the sixth century BC constructed [[constellation]] maps. Maps of the stars and the idea of mythological stories to explain them was largely being acquired all over the world and in several cultures. One similarity between them all was the preliminary understanding that the stars were fixed and immobile in the universe.

This understanding was incorporated into theorized models and mathematical representations of the cosmos by philosophers like [[Anaximander]] and [[Aristotle]] from the Ancient Greeks. Anaximander wrote a treatise, of which only few excerpts remain. In this work he states his proposed order of the celestial objects, the sun moon and the fixed stars. The stars he mentions are [[apertures]] of “wheel-like condensations filled with fire,” situated nearest to the earth in this system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anaximander and the Origins of Greek Cosmology|last1=Khan|first1=Charles|date=1960|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=84-85|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The records of Anaximander’s work left in fragments only gives a slight insight into reconstructing his intended meaning in understanding his views of the [[cosmos]]. Anaximander proposed a differing perspective from other later astronomers in proposing the fixed stars were nearest of the heavenly bodies to the earth. Other models of the planetary system show a [[celestial sphere]] containing fixed stars on the outer most part of the universe.

Aristotle and other like Greek thinkers of antiquity, and later the [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] model of the cosmos demonstrated an Earth centered universe. This [[Geocentric]] view was held through the Middle Ages and was later countered by subsequent astronomers and mathematicians alike, such as [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] and [[Johannes Kepler]]. The tradition of thought which appears in all of these systems of the universe, even with their divergent mechanisms, is the presence of a celestial sphere which contains the fixed stars. Ptolemy was influential with his heavily mathematical work, The ''[[Almagest]]'', which attempts to explain the peculiarity of stars that the moved. These “wandering stars,” planets, moved across the background of fixed stars which were spread along a sphere surrounding encompassing the universe. Later on, contemporary astronomers and mathematicians, like Copernicus challenged the long-standing view of geocentrism and constructed a sun centered universe, this being known as the [[heliocentric]] system. His system still upheld the tradition of a celestial sphere holding the fixed stars. Kepler also provided a model of the cosmos in his 1596 book ''Mysterium Cosmopgraphicum'' which pictures an image, labelling one celestial sphere, in Latin, "sphaera stellar fixar," or a sphere of fixed stars.

==The fixed stars are ''not'' fixed==

Astronomers and natural philosophers before divided the lights in the sky into two groups. One group contained the ''fixed stars'', which appear to rise and set but keep the same relative arrangement over time. The other group contained the [[naked eye planets]], which they called ''wandering stars''. (The Sun and [[Moon]] were sometimes called planets as well.) The planets seem to move and change their position over short periods of time (weeks or months). They always seem to move within the band of stars called the [[zodiac]] by Westerners. The planets can also be distinguished from fixed stars because stars tend to twinkle, while planets appear to shine with a steady light. However, fixed stars do have [[Parallax#Stellar parallax|parallax]], which is a change in apparent position caused by the orbital motion of the Earth. This effect was small enough not to be accurately measured until the 19th century. It can be used to find the distance to nearby stars. This motion is only apparent; it is the Earth that moves.

The fixed stars exhibit real motion as well, however. This motion may be viewed as having components that consist in part of motion of the galaxy to which the star belongs, in part of rotation of that galaxy, and in part of motion peculiar to the star itself within its galaxy. In the case of [[star system]]s or [[star cluster]]s, the individual components move with respect to each other in a non-linear manner.

This real motion of a star is  divided into ''radial'' motion and ''[[proper motion]]'', with "proper motion" being the component across the line of sight.&lt;ref name=Percy&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Variable Stars |author=John R. Percy |page= 21 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQzCDQI3YP4C&amp;pg=PA21 |isbn=0-521-23253-8 |date=2007 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1718 [[Edmund Halley]] announced his discovery that the fixed stars actually have proper motion.&lt;ref name=Koupelis1&gt;{{cite book |title=In Quest of the Universe |author=Theo Koupelis, Karl F. Kuhn |page= 369 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwKjznJ9Kq0C&amp;pg=PA369 |isbn=0-7637-4387-9 |date=2007 |publisher=[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper motion was not noticed by ancient cultures because it requires precise measurements over long periods of time to notice. In fact, the night sky today looks very much as it did thousands of years ago, so much so that some modern constellations were first named by the Babylonians.

A typical method to determine proper motion is to measure the position of a star relative to a limited, selected set of very distant objects that exhibit no mutual movement, and that, because of their distance, are assumed to have very small proper motion.&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;{{cite book |author= Peter Schneider |title=Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uP1Hz-6sHaMC&amp;pg=PA85 |page= 84, §2.6.5 |isbn=3-540-33174-3 |publisher=Springer |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach is to compare photographs of a star at different times against a large background of more distant objects.&lt;ref name=Axelrod&gt;{{cite book |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Astronomy
|author= Christopher De Pree, Alan Axelrod |edition= 3rd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1v3sK5uaEGcC&amp;pg=PA198 |date=2004 |page= 198 |isbn=1-59257-219-7 |publisher=[[Alpha Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The star with the largest known proper motion is [[Barnard's Star]].&lt;ref name=Koupelis1/&gt;

The phrase "fixed star" is technically incorrect, but nonetheless it is used in an historical context, and in classical mechanics.

==In classical mechanics==
{{main|Inertial frame of reference}}
In Newton's time the fixed stars were invoked as a reference frame supposedly at rest relative to [[absolute space]]. In other reference frames either at rest with respect to the fixed stars or in uniform translation relative to these stars, [[Newton's laws of motion]] were supposed to hold. In contrast, in frames accelerating with respect to the fixed stars, in particular frames rotating relative to the fixed stars, the laws of motion did not hold in their simplest form, but had to be supplemented by the addition of [[fictitious forces]], for example, the [[Coriolis force]] and the [[centrifugal force]].

As we now know, the fixed stars are not ''fixed''. The concept of inertial frames of reference is no longer tied to either the fixed stars or to absolute space. Rather, the identification of an inertial frame is based upon the simplicity of the laws of physics in the frame, in particular, the absence of fictitious forces.
Law of inertia holds for Galilean coordinate system which is a hypothetical system relative to which fixed stars remain fixed.

'''Flirty Fishing (FFing)''' is a form of [[evangelism|evangelistic]] [[Sacred prostitution|religious prostitution]] practiced by female members of the Children of God, currently known as [[Family International]] (TFI),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Flirty_Fishing Flirty Fishing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050712000929/http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Flirty_Fishing |date=2005-07-12 }}, xFamily&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title='The Family' and Final Harvest |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/children_of_god/child1.htm |quote=Sure, Alexander concedes, plenty of people object that The Family's 'Law of Love' permits sex outside marriage and that the group once condoned a practice known as 'flirty fishing' – the use of sex to win converts. |publisher=[[Washington Post]] |date=June 2, 1993 |accessdate=2008-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325012912/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/children_of_god/child1.htm |archive-date=2012-03-25 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from around 1974 to 1987.  According to some sources, hundreds of thousands of men were "fished" before the practice was discontinued.&lt;ref name="statistics"/&gt;

==Etymology and definition==
The term is derived from [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 4:19 from the [[New Testament]], in which [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] tells two fishermen that he will make them "fishers of men".&lt;ref name="matthew"&gt;Matthew 4:19 (KJV, NIV, NKJV). Retrieved from [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%204:19;&amp;version=9;31;50; ''BibleGateway.com''].&lt;/ref&gt;  Cult leader [[David Berg]] extrapolated from this that women in his movement should be "flirty fishers" (also called "bait" or "fisherwomen"). The targeted men were called "fish". The cult published several documents with exact instructions. Flirty Fishing was defined as using sex appeal for [[Proselytization|proselytizing]].

Berg noted that Flirty Fishing did not necessarily entail intercourse, but that this was by far the most efficient method of proselytizing.&lt;ref name="proselytism"&gt;In a 1982 family publication, Berg stated that only one-seventh (14%) of fish were "loved sexually", but he also noted that "loving sexually" was far and above the most effective method of witnessing in that it was 3,000 times more effective than conventional forms of proselytizing.

==Within the Family of God==

===Impact on members===
Women who objected to being what the cult itself bluntly described as "God's whores" or "hookers for Jesus" were admonished not to "let self and pride enter in",&lt;ref name="flirtyfishy"&gt;[http://xfamily.org/index.php/True_Komix_-_Little_Flirty_Fishy True Komix #293 DO "The Little Flirty Fishy"]&lt;/ref&gt; and reminded that their body did not really belong to them, as according to [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 6:19–20 it had been "bought" (by Jesus through his crucifixion) "with a price".&lt;ref name="corinthians"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%206:19-20;&amp;version=9; |title=1 Corinthians 19–20 (KJV) |access-date=2008-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501194731/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:19-20;&amp;version=9; |archive-date=2008-05-01 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After an initial phase, male members no longer partook in this drive, partially because of the cult's dismissive stance towards [[homosexuality]], but also because Berg thought it did not "pay off financially".&lt;ref name="reports" /&gt; Many of the flirty fishers had boyfriends, were married, or had children. In Family publications, flirty fishers and escort service practitioners (see below) frequently reported that they found their work hard, dangerous, and exhausting.

===ESing===
The financial benefit of Flirty Fishing soon led to a further degeneration of the practice from mere flirting into "loving sexually" to "escort servicing" (ESing)&amp;mdash;described as "making FFing pay" by Berg&amp;mdash;in which female cult members would work as regular [[call girl]]s for [[Escort agency|escort agencies]] or freelance, and merely "witness" (proselytize) to their clients when the occasion offered itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Escort_Servicing |title=Escort Servicing |access-date=2007-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103182746/http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Escort_Servicing |archive-date=2007-01-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===
The Children of God practised flirty fishing and escort servicing from 1974 until 1987, when it was officially abandoned, in part because of the [[AIDS]] epidemic. As the women were expected to keep exact records of their "fruits" (successes), a 1988 statistic showed that more than 223,000 men had been "fished" since 1978&lt;ref name="statistics"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://xfamily.org/images/a/a8/FF-Stats-1988-10-01.jpg |title=FFing Statistics |access-date=2008-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102110639/http://www.xfamily.org/images/a/a8/FF-Stats-1988-10-01.jpg |archive-date=2007-01-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;and that FFing had nevertheless continued into 1988. As the cult generally discourages [[birth control]], the practice also resulted in numerous pregnancies, the offspring of which were termed ''Jesus babies'' by the organization.&lt;ref name="jesusbabies"&gt;[http://xfamily.org/index.php/Jesus_baby "Jesus baby" article from xfamily.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Girls Who Code''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] which aims to support and increase the number of women in [[computer science]]. The organization is working to close the gender employment difference in technology and change the image of what a programmer looks like. They have a 7-week Summer Immersion Program, a 2-week specialized Campus Program, after school Clubs, and a 13-book [[The New York Times|New York Times]] best-selling series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2017/09/10/childrens-middle-grade-hardcover/|title=Children’s Middle Grade Hardcover Books - Best Sellers - September 10, 2017 - The New York Times|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to inspire, educate, and equip young women with the computing skills to pursue 21st century opportunities.

==Summary==
Girls Who Code was founded by [[Reshma Saujani]] in 2012 who came up with the idea of creating the organization during her run for the [[United States Congress]] when she noticed that schools along her campaign route lacked girls in computer science classrooms.&lt;ref name="USA TODAY 2014"/&gt; The organization runs programs during the academic year teaching high school girls computing skills like [[computer programming|programming]], [[robotics]], and [[web design]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/reshma-saujanis-ambitious-plan-for-technology-1415237831 |title= Reshma Saujani’s Ambitious Plan for Technology |date= November 5, 2014 |accessdate= February 14, 2015 |first= Christopher |last= Ross |work= Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "One Million"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/girls-who-code-leading-charge-for-women-in-computer-science/ |title= Aiming for 1 million "Girls Who Code" |date= December 11, 2014 |accessdate= February 15, 2015 |work= CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; with sessions including projects and trips to companies like [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name="USA TODAY 2014"&gt;{{cite web | title=No boys allowed: Girls Who Code takes on gender gap | website=USA TODAY | date=August 15, 2014  | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/08/12/girls-who-code-facebook-sheryl-sandberg/13784445/ | accessdate=February 15, 2015|author= Guynn, Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tc&gt;{{cite web |url= https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/14/girls-who-code-expands-to-get-more-young-women-in-computer-science-majors/ |title= Girls Who Code Expands To Get More Young Women In Computer Science Majors |work= Tech Crunch |date= December 14, 2014 |accessdate= February 15, 2015 |first= Sarah |last= Buhr}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now over 1500 Girls Who Code clubs across America, with the organization aiming to teach one million girls to code by 2020.&lt;ref name = "One Million"/&gt; By December 2014, three thousand students had completed a Girls Who Code program, 95% of whom went on to major in computer science at university.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web |url= http://time.com/3062885/girls-who-code-google-facebook/ |title= Cracking the Girl Code: How to End the Tech Gender Gap |work= Time |date= July 31, 2014 |first= Eliana |last= Dockterman |accessdate= February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, only 18% of computer science college graduates are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/cracking-the-code:-why-aren-t-more-women-majoring-in-computer-science|title=Cracking the code: Why aren't more women majoring in computer science?|last=Vu|first=Shana|website=UCLA Newsroom|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://girlswhocode.com/about-us/|title=Girls Who Code - About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of Girls Who Code, [[Reshma Saujani]], believes that girls are raised to "be perfect" while boys are raised to "be brave".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Saujani|first=Reshma|title=Teach girls bravery, not perfection|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/reshma_saujani_teach_girls_bravery_not_perfection?language=en|accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reshma Saujani participated in a [[TED (conference)|TED Talk]] where she spoke about the consequences girls face in their future if they don't start taking risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/girls-who-code/teach-girls-bravery-not-perfection-257691d13476#.nd7v6zqso|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She speaks of the tech industry and how she thinks there is a bias towards women in the industry. The company announced that in 2016 the non-profit organization will be expanding to all 50 states- making it the largest computing program for girls in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=the largest computer science program for girls in the U.S.!|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, the nonprofit launched a 13-book series with [[Penguin Random House]], including a nonfiction book, Girls Who Code: Learn to Code and Change the World, and several fiction books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/books/coding-children.html|title=Teaching Kids Coding, by the Book|last=Alter|first=Alexandra|date=2017-08-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the spring of 2018, Girls Who Code will have reached more than 50,000 girls with their computer science education programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://girlswhocode.com/clubs-launch-2017/|title=Girls Who Code free after school Clubs launch for 2017-2018|date=2017-10-04|work=girlswhocode|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's efforts to close the [[gender gaps in mathematics and reading|achievement gender gap]] has resulted in several honors. Saujani was recognized for 'her vision and efforts to close the gender gap in technology'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202771539858/Law-Firm-Awards-Girls-Who-Code-Founder-?slreturn=20161019022429|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships ==
With the support of their sponsors, Girls Who Code is building the largest pipeline of future female engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://girlswhocode.com/partners/|title=Partners - Girls Who Code|last=|first=|date=|work=girlswhocode|access-date=2017-12-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gordon–Loeb''' /ˈgȯr-dən ˈlōb/ '''Model''' is a mathematical [[economic model]] analyzing the optimal investment level in [[information security]].

Investing to protect company data involves a cost that, unlike other investments, usually does not generate profit. It does, however, serve to prevent additional costs. Thus, it’s important to compare how expensive it is to protect a specific set of data, with the potential loss in case said data is stolen, lost, damaged or corrupted. To draft this model, the company must possess knowledge of three parameters: how much the data is worth; how much the data is at risk; the probability an attack on the data is going to be successful. This last parameter, Gordon and Loeb defined as '''vulnerability'''. The product of said parameters provides the medium money loss with no security investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Big Data e Privacy by design|author=Giuseppe D'Acquisto, Maurizio Naldi|publisher=G.Giappichelli Editor|isbn=978-88-921-0629-1|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=Ig9EDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Gordon-Loeb.png|thumb|Ideal level of investment in company computer security, given decreasing incremental returns]]

From the model we can gather that the amount of money a company spends in protecting information should, in most cases, be only a small fraction of the predicted loss (for example, [[expected value]] of a loss following a [[security breach]]). Specifically, the model shows that it is generally inconvenient to invest in informatics security (including [[cybersecurity]] or [[computer security]] related activities) for amounts higher than '''37%''' of the predicted loss. The Gordon-Loeb model also shows that, for a specific level of potential loss, the amount of resources to invest in order to protect an information set does not always increase with the increase in [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] of said set. Thus, companies can enjoy greater economic returns by investing in cyber/information security activities aimed to increase the security of data sets with a medium level of vulnerability. In other words, the investment in safeguarding a company’s data reduces vulnerability with '''decreasing incremental returns'''.

'''Example''': suppose an estimated data value of '''1.000.000 euros''', with an attack probability of '''15%''', and an '''80%''' chance that an attack would be successful. In this case, the potential loss is given by the product '''1.000.000 euros x 0.15 x 0.8 = 120.000 euros'''. According to Gordon and Loeb, the company’s investment in security should not exceed '''120.000 euros x 0.37 = 44.000 euros'''.

The Gordon–Loeb Model was first published by [[Lawrence A. Gordon]] and [[Martin P. Loeb]] in their 2002 paper, in [http://tissec.acm.org/ ''ACM Transactions on Information and System Security''], entitled "The Economics of Information Security Investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Lawrence|author2=Martin Loeb|title=The Economics of Information Security Investment|journal=ACM Transactions on Information and System Security|date=November 2002|volume=5|issue=4|pages=438–457|doi=10.1145/581271.581274}}&lt;/ref&gt;" The paper was reprinted in the 2004 book [https://www.springer.com/computer/theoretical+computer+science/book/978-1-4020-8089-0 Economics of Information Security]. Gordon and Loeb are both Professors at the [[University of Maryland]]'s [[Robert H. Smith School of Business]].

In [[mathematics]], a '''Gödel numbering for sequences''' provides us an effective way to represent each finite sequence of natural numbers as a single natural number. Of course, the [[Injective function|embedding]] is surely possible set theoretically, but the emphasis is on the effectiveness of the functions manipulating such representations of sequences: the operations on sequences (accessing individual members, concatenation) can be "implemented" using [[total recursive function]]s, and in fact by [[primitive recursive function]]s.

It is usually used to build sequential “[[data type]]s” in the realm of arithmetic-based formalizations of some fundamental notions of mathematics. It is a specific case of the more general idea of [[Gödel numbering]].

For example, [[Mu-recursive function|recursive function theory]] can be regarded as a formalization of the notion of an [[algorithm]], and if we regard it as a [[programming language]], we can mimic [[List (computing)|list]]s by encoding a sequence of natural numbers in a single natural number. To achieve this, we can use various [[Number theory|number theoretic]] ideas; using the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] is a straightforward way, but there are also more economic approaches, such as using the [[pairing function]] combined with the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] in a sophisticated way.&lt;ref name=chinese_pairing&gt;[[#Mon76|Monk 1976]]: 56–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chinese_pairing2&gt;[[#Csir94|Csirmaz 1994]]: 99–100 (see [http://www.renyi.hu/~csirmaz/l10.ps.gz online])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gödel numbering ==
{{Main|Gödel numbering}}

Besides using Gödel numbering to encode unique sequences of symbols into unique natural numbers (i.e. place numbers into [[mutually exclusive]] or [[one-to-one correspondence]] with the sequences), we can use it to encode whole “architectures” of sophisticated “machines”. For example, we can encode [[Markov algorithm]]s,&lt;ref name=Markov&gt;[[#Mon76|Monk 1976]]: 72–74&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Turing machine]]s&lt;ref name=Turing&gt;[[#Mon76|Monk 1976]]: 52–55&lt;/ref&gt; into natural numbers and thereby prove that the expressive power of recursive function theory is no less than that of the former machine-like formalizations of algorithms.

== Accessing members ==

Any such representation of sequences should contain all the information as in the original sequence—most importantly, each individual member must be retrievable. However, the length does not have to match directly; even if we want to handle sequences of different length, we can store length data as a surplus member,&lt;ref name="rem"/&gt; or as the other member of an ordered pair by using a [[pairing function]].

We expect that there is an effective way for this information retrieval process in form of an appropriate total recursive function.  We want to find a totally recursive function ''f'' with the property that
for all ''n'' and for any ''n''-length sequence of natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\langle a_0,\dots a_{n-1} \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an appropriate natural number ''a'', called the Gödel number of the sequence, such that for all ''i'' where &lt;math&gt;0\le i \le n-1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(a,i) = a_i&lt;/math&gt;.

There are effective functions which can retrieve each member of the original sequence from a Gödel number of the sequence. Moreover, we can define some of them in a [[Constructive proof|constructive]] way, so we can go well beyond mere [[Nonconstructive proof|proofs of existence]].

=== Gödel's β-function lemma ===
{{see also|Gödel's β function}}

By an ingenious use of the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], we can constructively define such a recursive function  &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; (using simple number-theoretical functions, all of which can be defined in a total recursive way) fulfilling the [[specification]]s given above. Gödel defined the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; function using the Chinese remainder theorem in his article written in 1931. This is a [[primitive recursive function]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smu03|Smullyan 2003]]: 56 (= Chpt IV, § 5, note 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, for all ''n'' and for any ''n''-length sequence of natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\langle a_0,\dots a_{n-1} \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an appropriate natural number ''a'', called the Gödel number of the sequence such that &lt;math&gt;\beta(a,i) = a_i&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Godel_beta&gt;[[#Mon76|Monk 1976]]: 58 (= Thm 3.46)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Using a pairing function ====
{{Main|Pairing function}}

Our specific solution will depend on a pairing function—there are several ways to implement the pairing function, so one method must be selected. Now, we can [[Abstraction|abstract]] from the details of the [[implementation]] of the pairing function.  We need only to know its “[[Interface (computer science)|interface]]”: let &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, ''K'', and ''L'' denote the pairing function and its two [[Projection (mathematics)|projection]] functions, respectively, satisying [[specification]]
:&lt;math&gt;K\left(\pi\left(x,y\right)\right) = x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L\left(\pi\left(x,y\right)\right) = y&lt;/math&gt;

We shall not discuss and formalize the axiom for excluding alien objects here, as it is not required to understand the method.

==== Remainder for natural numbers ====

We shall use another auxiliary function that will compute the [[Remainder#The remainder for natural numbers|remainder for natural numbers]]. Examples:

* &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{rem}(5, 3) = 2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{rem}(7, 2) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

It can be proven that this function can be implemented as a recursive function.

==== Using the Chinese remainder theorem ====

===== Implementation of the β function =====

Using the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], we can prove that implementing &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;\beta(s,i) = \mathrm{rem}\left(K\left(s\right),\left(i+1\right)\cdot L\left(s\right)+1\right)&lt;/math&gt;
will work, according to the specification we expect &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; to satisfy. We can use a more concise form by an [[abuse of notation]] (constituting a sort of [[pattern matching]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\beta\left(\pi\left(x_0,m\right),i\right) = \mathrm{rem}\left(x_0, \left(i+1\right)\cdot m+1\right)&lt;/math&gt;
Let us achieve even more readability by more [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]] and [[Code reuse|reuse]] (as these notions are used in computer science&lt;ref name=whyfp&gt;[[#Hugh89|Hughes 1989]] (see [http://www.math.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208151518/http://www.math.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html |date=2006-12-08 }})&lt;/ref&gt;): by defining &lt;math&gt;\forall i&lt;n&lt;/math&gt; the sequence &lt;math&gt;m_i = (i+1)\cdot m+1&lt;/math&gt;, we can write
:&lt;math&gt;\beta\left(\pi\left(x_0,m\right),i\right) = \mathrm{rem}\left(x_0, m_i\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
We shall use this &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; notation in the proof.

===== Hand-tuned assumptions =====

For proving the correctness of the above definition of the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; function, we shall use several lemmas. These have their own assumptions. Now we try to find out these assumptions, calibrating and tuning their strength carefully: they should not be said in an either superfluously sharp, or unsatisfactorily weak form.

Let &lt;math&gt;a_0,\dots a_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of natural numbers.
Let ''m'' be chosen to satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;\forall i \in \overline n \setminus \left\{0\right\} \left(i \mid m\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall i &lt; n \left( a_i &lt; m_i \right)&lt;/math&gt;
The first assumption is meant as
:&lt;math&gt;1 \mid m \land \dots \land n-1 \mid m&lt;/math&gt;
It is needed to meet an assumption of the Chinese remainder theorem (that of being pairwise [[coprime]]). In the literature, sometimes this requirement is replaced with a stronger one, e.g. [[Constructive proof|constructively]] built with the [[factorial]] function,&lt;ref name=chinese_pairing/&gt; but the stronger premise is not required for this proof.&lt;ref name=chinese_pairing2/&gt;

The second assumption does not concern the Chinese remainder theorem in any way. It will have importance in proving that the specification for &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is met eventually.  It ensures that an &lt;math&gt;\tilde x&lt;/math&gt; solution of the simultaneous congruence system
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_i \pmod{m_i}&lt;/math&gt; for each ''i'' where &lt;math&gt;0\le i \le n-1&lt;/math&gt;
also satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;a_i = \mathrm{rem}(\tilde x, m_i)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=rem&gt;[[#Csir94|Csirmaz 1994]]: 100 (see [http://www.renyi.hu/~csirmaz/l10.ps.gz online])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ArithmeticI&gt;[[#Bur98|Burris 1998]]: Supplementary Text, [http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~snburris/htdocs/scav/fo_arith/fo_arith.html Arithmetic I], Lemma 4&lt;/ref&gt;
A stronger assumption for ''m'' requiring &lt;math&gt;\forall i &lt; n \; (a_i &lt; m)&lt;/math&gt; automatically satisfies the second assumption (if we define the notation &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; as above).

=== Proof that (coprimality) assumption for Chinese remainder theorem is met ===

In the section [[#Hand-tuned assumptions|Hand-tuned assumptions]], we required that
:&lt;math&gt;\forall i \in \overline n \setminus \left\{0\right\} \left(i \mid m\right)&lt;/math&gt;. What we want to prove is that we can produce a sequence of pairwise [[coprime]] numbers in a way that will turn out to correspond to the [[#Implementation of the β function|Implementation of the β function]].

In detail:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall i&lt;n,j &lt; n \; \left( i \neq j \rightarrow \mathrm{coprime}\left(m_i,m_j\right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
remembering that &lt;math&gt;\forall i&lt;n&lt;/math&gt; we defined &lt;math&gt;m_i = (i+1)\cdot m+1&lt;/math&gt;.

The proof is by contradiction; assume the negation of the original statement:
:&lt;math&gt;\exists i&lt;n,j &lt; n \; \left( i \neq j \land \lnot \mathrm{coprime}\left(m_i,m_j\right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

==== First steps ====

We know what “coprime” relation means (in a lucky way, its negation can be formulated in a concise form); thus, let us substitute in the appropriate way:
:&lt;math&gt;\exists i&lt;n,j &lt; n \; \left( i \neq j \land \exists p \in \mathrm{Prime} \; \left( p \mid m_i \land p \mid m_j \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
Using a “more” [[prenex normal form]] (but note allowing a constraint-like notation in quantifiers):
:&lt;math&gt;\exists i&lt;n,j &lt; n,p \in \mathrm{Prime} \; \left( i \neq j \land p \mid m_i \land p \mid m_j \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Because of a theorem on [[Divisor|divisibility]], &lt;math&gt;p \mid m_i \land p \mid m_j&lt;/math&gt; allows us to also say
:&lt;math&gt;p \mid m_i - m_j&lt;/math&gt;.

Substituting the [[definition]]s of &lt;math&gt;m_k&lt;/math&gt;-sequence notation, we get &lt;math&gt;m_i - m_j = (i-j) \cdot m&lt;/math&gt;, thus (as [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]] axioms postulate identity to be  a [[congruence relation]] &lt;ref name=congid&gt;see also related notions, e.g. “equals for equals” ([[Referential transparency (computer science)|referential transparency]]), and another related notion Leibniz's law / [[identity of indiscernibles]]&lt;/ref&gt;) we get
:&lt;math&gt; p \mid (i-j) \cdot m&lt;/math&gt;.
Since ''p'' is a [[prime element]] (note that the [[irreducible element]] property is used), we get
:&lt;math&gt;p \mid i-j \lor p \mid m&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Resorting to the first hand-tuned assumption ====

Now we must resort to our assumption
:&lt;math&gt;\forall i \in \overline n \setminus \left\{0\right\} \left(i \mid m\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
The assumption was chosen carefully to be as weak as possible, but strong enough to enable us to use it now.

The assumed negation of the original statement contains an appropriate existential statement using indices &lt;math&gt;i&lt;n\land j&lt;n \land i\neq j&lt;/math&gt;; this entails &lt;math&gt;i-j \in \overline n \setminus \left\{0\right\}&lt;/math&gt;, thus the mentioned assumption can be applied, so &lt;math&gt;i-j \mid m&lt;/math&gt; holds.

==== Using an (object) theorem of the propositional calculus as a lemma ====

We can prove by several means &lt;ref&gt;either proof theoretic (algebraic steps); or semantic ([[truth table]], [[method of analytic tableaux]], [[Venn diagram]], [[Karnaugh map|Veitch diagram / Karnaugh map]])&lt;/ref&gt; known in [[propositional calculus]] that
:&lt;math&gt;\left(A \land \left( A \rightarrow B\right)\right) \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;
holds.

Since &lt;math&gt;i-j \mid m&lt;/math&gt;, by the [[Transitive relation|transitivity]] property of the [[Divisor|divisibility]] relation, &lt;math&gt;p \mid i-j \rightarrow p \mid m&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus (as equality axioms postulate identity to be a congruence relation &lt;ref name=congid/&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;p \mid m&lt;/math&gt;
can be proven.

==== Reaching the contradiction ====

The negation of original statement contained
:&lt;math&gt;p \mid m_i&lt;/math&gt;
and we have just proved
:&lt;math&gt;p \mid m&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;p \mid m_i - \left(i+1\right)\cdot m&lt;/math&gt;
should also hold.
But after substituting the [[definition]] of &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;m_i - \left(i+1\right)\cdot m = 1&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, summarizing the above three statements, by [[Transitive relation|transitivity]] of the [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]],
:&lt;math&gt;p \mid 1&lt;/math&gt;
should also hold.

However, in the negation of the original statement ''p'' is [[Existential quantifier|existentially quantified]] and restricted to primes &lt;math&gt;\exists p \in \mathrm{Prime}&lt;/math&gt;.  This establishes the contradiction we wanted to reach.

==== End of reductio ad absurdum ====

By reaching contradiction with its negation, we have just proven the original statement:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall i&lt;n,j&lt;n \; \left( i \neq j \rightarrow \mathrm{coprime}\left(m_i,m_j\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

=== The system of simultaneous congruences ===

We build a system of simultaneous congruences
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_0 \pmod{m_0}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\vdots&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_{n-1} \pmod{m_{n-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

We can write it in a more concise way:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall i &lt; n \; \left(x \equiv a_i \pmod{m_i}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Many statements will be said below, all beginning with "&lt;math&gt;\forall i &lt; n \; \left(\dots\right)&lt;/math&gt;". To achieve a more ergonomic treatment, from now on all statements should be read as being in the scope of an &lt;math&gt;\forall i &lt; n \; \left(\dots\right)&lt;/math&gt; quantification. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\forall i &lt; n (&lt;/math&gt; begins here.

Let us chose a solution &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; for the system of simultaneous congruences. At least one solution must exist, because &lt;math&gt;m_0,\dots m_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise comprime as proven in the previous sections, so we can refer to the solution ensured by the Chinese remainder theorem. Thus, from now on we can regard &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; as satisfying
:&lt;math&gt;x_0 \equiv a_i \pmod{m_i}&lt;/math&gt;,
which means (by definition of [[modular arithmetic]]) that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{rem}\left(x_0,m_i\right) = \mathrm{rem}\left(a_i,m_i\right)&lt;/math&gt;

==== Resorting to the second hand-tuned assumption ====

Recall the second assumption,  “&lt;math&gt;\forall i &lt; n \; \left(a_i &lt; m_i \right)&lt;/math&gt;”, and remember that we are now in the scope of an implicit quantification for ''i'', so we don't repeat its quantification for each statement.

The second assumption &lt;math&gt;a_i &lt; m_i&lt;/math&gt; implies that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{rem}\left(a_i,m_i\right) = a_i&lt;/math&gt;.
Now by [[Transitive relation|transitivity]] of [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]] we get
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{rem}\left(x_0,m_i\right) = a_i&lt;/math&gt;.

==== QED ====

Our original goal was to prove that the definition
:&lt;math&gt;\beta\left(\pi\left(x_0,m\right),i\right) = \mathrm{rem}\left(x_0,m_i\right)&lt;/math&gt;
is good for achieving what we declared in the specification of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;: we want &lt;math&gt;\beta\left(\pi\left(x_0,m\right),i\right) = a_i&lt;/math&gt; to hold.

This can be seen now by [[Transitive relation|transitivity]] of [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]], looking at the above three equations.

(The large scope of ''i'' ends here.)

=== Existence and uniqueness ===

We have just proven the correctness of the definition of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;: its specification requiring
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a_0,\dots, a_{n-1}\;\exists s\;\forall i &lt; n \; \beta(s,i) = a_i&lt;/math&gt;
is met. Although proving this was most important for establishing an encoding scheme for sequences, we have to fill in some gaps yet. These are related notions similar to [[Existential quantification|existence]] and [[Uniqueness quantification|uniqueness]] (although on uniqueness, “at most one” should be meant here, and the conjunction of both is delayed as a final result).

==== Uniqueness of encoding, achieved by minimalization ====

Our ultimate question is: what number should stand for the encoding of sequence &lt;math&gt;\left\langle a_0,\dots,a_{n-1}\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;? The specification declares only an existential quantification, not yet a functional connection. We want a [[Constructive proof|constructive]] and algorithmic connection: a (total) recursive function that performs the encoding.

==== Totality, because minimalization is restricted to special functions ====

This gap can be filled in &lt;!-- not a mistake--&gt;in a straightforward way: we shall use [[Mu operator|minimalization]], and the totality of the resulting function is ensured by everything we have proven till now (i.e. the correctness of the definition of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; by meeting its specification). In fact, the specification
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a_0,\dots, a_{n-1}\;\exists s\;\forall i &lt; n \; \beta(s,i) = a_i&lt;/math&gt;
plays a role here of a more general notion (“special function”&lt;ref name=special_function&gt;[[#Mon76|Monk 1976]]: 45 (= Def 3.1.)&lt;/ref&gt;). The importance of this notion is that it enables us to split off the (sub)class of  (total) recursive functions from the (super)class of partial recursive functions. In brief, the specification says that a function ''f''
&lt;ref&gt;E.g. defined by
:&lt;math&gt;f : \mathbb N^{n+1} \to \mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f\left(a_0,\dots, a_{n-1}, s\right) = \begin{cases}0 &amp; \mathrm{if}\;\forall i &lt; n \; \left(\beta(s,i) = a_i\right) \\ 1 &amp; \mathrm{if}\;\exists i &lt; n \; \left( \beta(s,i) \neq a_i \right)\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
satisfying the specification
:&lt;math&gt;f\left(a_0,\dots, a_{n-1}, s\right) = 0 \leftrightarrow \forall i &lt; n \; \left(\beta(s,i) = a_i\right)&lt;/math&gt;
is a special function; that is, for each fixed combination of all-but-last arguments, the function ''f'' has [[root of a function|root]] in its last argument:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a_0,\dots,a_{n-1}\;\exists s\; \left(f\left(a_0,\dots,a_{n-1},s\right)=0\right)&lt;/math&gt;

==== The Gödel numbering function g can be chosen to be total recursive ====

Thus, let us choose the minimal possible number that fits well in the specification of the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; function:&lt;ref name="rem" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g : \mathbb N^n \to \mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle a_0,\dots,a_{n-1}\right\rangle \longmapsto \mu a . \left[ \forall i &lt; n \; \left(\beta\left(a,i\right) = a_i\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;.
It can be proven (using the notions of the previous section ) that ''g'' is (total) recursive.

=== Access of length ===

If we use the above scheme for encoding sequences only in contexts where the length of the sequences is fixed, then no problem arises. In other words, we can use them in an [[Analogy|analogous]] way as arrays are used in programming.

But sometimes we need dynamically stretching sequences, or we need to deal with sequences whose length cannot be [[Typeful programming|type]]d in a static way. In other words, we may encode sequences in an analogous way to [[List (computing)|list]]s in programming.

To illustrate both cases: if we form the Gödel numbering of a Turing machine, then the each row in the matrix of the “program” can be represented with tuples, sequences of fixed length (thus, without storing the length), because the number of the columns is fixed.&lt;ref name=stat&gt;[[#Mon76|Monk 1976]]: 53 (= Def 3.20, Lem 3.21)&lt;/ref&gt; But if we want to reason about configuration-like things (of Turing-machines), and specifically if we want to encode the significant part of the tape of a running Turing machine, then we have to represent sequences together with their length. We can mimic dynamically stretching sequences by representing sequence concatenation (or at least, augmenting a sequence with one more element) with a totally recursive function.&lt;ref name=dyn&gt;[[#Csir94|Csirmaz 1994]]: 101 (=Thm 10.7, Conseq 10.8), see [http://www.renyi.hu/~csirmaz/l10.ps.gz online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Length can be stored simply as a surplus member:&lt;ref name="rem" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g : \mathbb N^* \to \mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle a_0,\dots,a_{n-1}, a_n\right\rangle \longmapsto \mu a . \left[ a_0 = n \land \forall i &lt; n \; \left(\beta\left(a,i+1\right) = a_i\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

The corresponding modification of the proof is straightforward, by adding a surplus
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv n \pmod{m_0}&lt;/math&gt;
to the system of simultaneous congruences (provided that the surplus member index is chosen to be 0). Also, the assumptions have to be modified accordingly.

'''Kenneth "Harry" Oldmeadow''' is an [[Australia]]n academic, [[author]], [[editing|editor]] and [[educator]] whose works focus on [[religion]], [[tradition]], [[Traditionalist School|traditionalist writers]] and [[philosophy]].

==Life and career==

Oldmeadow was born in [[Melbourne]] in 1947. His parents were [[Christian]] [[missionaries]] in [[India]] and he spent the first nine years of his childhood there and developed an early interest in the civilisations of the East.&lt;ref name = "WWauthors"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [https://www.editions-hozhoni.com/contributeurs/harry-oldmeadow/ Éditions Hozoni]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oldmeadow studied history, politics and literature at the [[Australian National University]] and the [[University of Sydney]], as well as working as a history tutor at [[La Trobe University]] in [[Melbourne]]. In 1971 a Commonwealth Overseas Research Scholarship allowed him to study at [[Oxford University]], followed by extensive travel in Europe and North Africa.&lt;ref name = "WWauthors"/&gt;

In 1980 he achieved a [[master's degree]] in [[religious studies]] at the [[University of Sydney]] where he completed a dissertation on the work of [[Frithjof Schuon]] and the other principal [[tradition]]alist writers.&lt;ref&gt; (fr) [http://www.almora.fr/auteur/harry-oldmeadow.html Almora auteur]&lt;/ref&gt;  This study was awarded the University of Sydney Medal for excellence in research and was eventually published by the [[Sri Lanka]] Institute of Traditional Studies under the title ''Traditionalism: Religion in the Light of the Perennial Philosophy'' (Colombo, 2000).&lt;ref name = "WWauthors"&gt;[http://www.worldwisdom.com/public/authors/Harry-Oldmeadow.aspx World Wisdom]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the auspices of this institute, Oldmeadow delivered the Inaugural [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] Memorial Lecture in [[Colombo]] on ''The Religious Tradition of the Australian Aborigines''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sinha |first=Lalita |date=2008 |title= Unveiling the Garden of Love: Mystical Symbolism |url= https://books.google.fr/books?id=z3Z3Lg1sUOMC&amp;pg=PA209 |location= |publisher=World Wisdom |page=209 |isbn= 9781933316635 |author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tes.com/teaching-resource/some-puzzles-and-conundrums-in-the-teaching-of-religion-audio-lecture-11020410 Tes, Puzzles and conandrums in the teaching of religion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioperennis.org/documents/Oldmeadow/MelodiesE.pdf Religio perennis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oldmeadow was the Co-ordinator of Philosophy and Religious Studies at [[La Trobe University]], Bendigo. He has published extensively in such journals as ''Sacred Web'' (Vancouver), ''Sophia'' (Washington DC) and ''Asian Philosophy'' (Nottingham, UK). In late 2001, he was a key speaker at a large interfaith gathering in Sydney organised by the [[Australian Centre for Sufism]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiansuficentre.org/events.htm Australian Sufi Center]&lt;/ref&gt; the theme of the meeting was the need for interreligious understanding in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]].

The rising of the [[Pleiades]] heralded the start of the [[Ancient Greek]] sailing season, using [[celestial navigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pleiad, n |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=December 2014 |accessdate=2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause and significance==
[[Image:Kepler_Observatory_Linz_under_the_Stars.jpg|thumb|Sirius is the present star with the greatest [[apparent magnitude]] (after the sun) and one which is almost non-variable. The [[Pleiades]], a key feature of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] shown across [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] in the same photograph also experience an annual period of visibility ("rising and setting").]]
Relative to the other stars, the sun appears to drift eastward (about {{frac|1|365.24219}} of Earth's orbit—hence almost one degree—per solar day) along a path called the [[ecliptic]] (specifically appearing in front of 13 constellations considered the [[zodiac]] constellations from a total of [[88 modern constellations]]) which is, by definition, the plane of the earth's orbit.  While the sun appears in front of (or south or north of) a relatively small group of stars they can no longer be seen either before dawn, during daytime or after sunset{{efn|except as to those directly north and south of it can be observed in a full [[solar eclipse]] or other rare conditions e.g. near the poles in the very early or late day}} &amp;mdash; their appearance coincides with that of the sun above the [[horizon]].  Depending on the observer's latitude many stars are subject to annual heliacal risings and settings.  Rising means the local latitude of the earth has moved along its orbit such that the star, star cluster or galaxy emerges for part of the year to within months be visible for the whole night and then for the early portion of the night. Thus the star's first emergence, an annual rise, is immediately before dawn. The risen status of each star is easiest considered day-on-day in the [[tropics]] where the time of dawn varies less. The rising of a star which has had its annual rising ("heliacal rising"), typically over months, rises earlier at night and so at dawn figures more toward its annual highest point (meridian) and then in later dawns more toward the west all by about {{frac|1|182}}th of its arc (about {{frac|1|365}} of the circle) per day, until, observing the western sky after sunset, it has already disappeared. This is called the ''cosmical setting''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sizes.com/time/risesetstar.htm rising and setting of stars]&lt;/ref&gt; The same star will reappear in the eastern sky at dawn approximately one year after its previous rising. For zodiac and near-zodiac constellations (near the [[ecliptic]], the apparent daily path of the sun), Earth's [[precession of the equinoxes|precession]] means the date of their rising decreases gradually, completing one cycle in about 26,000 years (for example at the March Equinox, the position of the Sun relative the stars &amp;mdash; at which Right Ascension is calibrated as zero, the [[First Point of Aries]], is in the preceding constellation of Pisces.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeoastronomy.wordpress.com/2005/09/10/archaic-astronomy-and-heliacal-rising/ Archaic Astronomy and Heliacal Rising]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-application to circumpolar stars at extra-tropical latitudes==
Some stars, when viewed from [[latitude]]s outside of the tropics on Earth, do not rise or set. These are [[circumpolar star]]s, which are either always in the sky or never.  For example, the [[North Star]] (Polaris) is not visible in Australia and the [[Southern Cross]] is not seen in Europe, because they always stay below the respective horizons.  

The term ''circumpolar'' is somewhat localised as between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator, the Southern polar constellations have a brief spell of annual visibility (thus "heliacal" rising and "cosmic" setting) and the same applies as to the other polar constellations in respect of the reverse tropic.

== History ==
Constellations containing stars that rise and set were incorporated into early [[calendar]]s or [[zodiac]]s. The [[Sumer]]ians, [[Babylonia]]ns, [[ancient Egyptians|Egyptians]], and [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] all used the heliacal risings of various stars for the timing of agricultural activities.

Because of its position about 40° off the ecliptic, the heliacal risings of the bright star [[Sirius]] occur over a "Sothic year" almost exactly synchronized with the [[solar year]].{{efn|The [[Sothic year]] is about a minute longer than a [[solar year]].&lt;ref name=teacosy&gt;{{harvp|Tetley|2014|p=[http://www.egyptchronology.com/uploads/2/6/9/4/26943741/ch_3_investigating_ancient_egyptian_calendars.pdf 42]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Since the development of [[civilization]], this has occurred at [[Cairo]] on July 19 on the [[Julian calendar]].&lt;ref name=lavia/&gt;{{efn|The exact date varies with [[latitude]], so that Sirius's return is observed about 8–10 days later on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast than at [[Elephantine|Aswan]].&lt;ref name=teatime&gt;{{citation |last=Tetley |first=M. Christine |title=The Reconstructed Chronology of the Egyptian Kings, ''Vol. I'' |url=http://www.egyptchronology.com/vols-1--2.html |date=2014 |p=[http://www.egyptchronology.com/uploads/2/6/9/4/26943741/ch_3_investigating_ancient_egyptian_calendars.pdf 43] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Official observations were made at [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] or [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] near [[Cairo]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], and [[Elephantine]] near [[Aswan]].&lt;ref name=teatime/&gt; The date at any location also slowly varies within the [[Gregorian calendar]], owing to its omission of three leap years every four centuries. It presently occurs on 3 August.&lt;ref name=lavia&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.lavia.org/english/archivo/egyptiancalendaren.html |contribution=Ancient Egyptian Civil Calendar |title=La Via |url=http://www.lavia.org/indexIT.html |accessdate=8 February 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Its returns also roughly corresponded to the onset of the [[flooding of the Nile|annual flooding]] of the [[Nile]] before it was ended by the [[Aswan Low Dam|Aswan Low]] and [[Aswan High Dam|High Dams]]. The [[ancient Egypt]]ians appear to have constructed their 365-day [[Egyptian calendar|civil calendar]] at a time when Wep Renpet, its [[New Year]], corresponded with Sirius's return to the night sky.&lt;ref name=teacosy/&gt; Although this calendar's lack of [[leap year]]s caused the event to shift one day every four years or so, [[Egyptian astronomy|astronomical records]] of this displacement led to the discovery of the [[Sothic cycle]] and, later, the establishment of the more accurate [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Alexandrian calendar]]s.

The Egyptians also devised a method of telling the time at night based on the heliacal risings of 36 [[Decans|decan stars]], one for each 10° segment of the 360° circle of the zodiac and corresponding to the ten-day "weeks" of their civil calendar.

To the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]], the [[Pleiades]] are called [[Matariki]], and their heliacal rising signifies the beginning of the new year (around June). The [[Mapuche]] of [[South America]] called the Pleiades ''Ngauponi'' which in the vicinity of the ''[[we tripantu]]'' (Mapuche new year) will disappear by the west, ''lafkenmapu'' or ''ngulumapu'', appearing at dawn to the East, a few days before the birth of new life in nature. Heliacal rising of Ngauponi, i.e. appearance of the Pleiades by the horizon over an hour before the Sun approximately 12 days before the winter solstice, announced ''we tripantu''.

When a planet has a heliacal rising, there is a [[Conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] with the sun beforehand. Depending on the type of conjunction, there may be a [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]], [[eclipse]], [[Transit (astronomy)|transit]], or [[occultation]] of the sun.

==Rising at sunset==
The rising of a planet above the eastern horizon at [[sunset]] is called its ''acronychal rising'', which for a [[superior planet]] signifies an [[opposition (planets)|opposition]], another type of [[syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]]. 

When the Moon has an acronychal rising, it will occur near [[full moon]] and thus, in a small number of cases, a noticeable [[lunar eclipse]].

Control theory refers to the control of ([[continuous function|continuous]]) [[dynamical systems]], with the aim being to avoid delays, overshoots, or [[stability theory|instability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Control Systems Engineering|last=Nise|first=Norman|publisher=Wiley|year=2015|isbn=978-1118170519|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information engineers tend to focus more on control theory rather than the physical design of control systems and [[Electronic circuit|circuits]] (which tends to fall under electrical engineering).

Subfields of control theory include [[classical control theory|classical control]], [[optimal control]], and [[nonlinear control]].

===Signal processing===
{{Main article|Signal processing}}
Signal processing refers to the generation, analysis and use of [[signals]], which could take many forms such as [[image processing|image]], [[sound processing|sound]], electrical, or biological.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Digital Signal Processing|last=Lyons|first=Richard|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2010|isbn=978-0137027415|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The International Society of Military Sciences''' ('''ISMS''') is an international organization whose stated aim is to build a strong network for the creation, development, exchange and diffusion of research and knowledge about war, conflict management and peace support efforts. The ISMS was founded in October 2008. The [[Austrian National Defence Academy]], the [[Royal Military College of Canada]], the [[Danish Defence|Royal Danish Defence College]], the [[Finnish National Defence University]], the [[Koninklijke Militaire Academie|Netherlands Defence Academy]], the [[Norwegian Defence University College]], the [[Swedish National Defence College]] and the [[Baltic Defence College]] established this society with the intention to further research and academic education in military arts and sciences in the broadest sense.

==Establishing the ISMS==

In the summer of 2007 the Faculty of Military Sciences, Netherlands Defence Academy, started working on more international collaboration on an institutional level. Canada, Sweden and Austria were the first military institutes and universities which were approached for collaboration. Soon four other institutes joined in. In November 2011, the [[National Defence University of Warsaw]] and the [[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)]] were voted in. The Royal Military Academy of Belgium withdrew their membership before the council meeting in Oslo, May 2017.

==Letter of Intent==

The formal signing of the ''Letter of Intent'' was on October 22, 2008 in Copenhagen. That day the participating academies also decided to formally present the ISMS in November 2009 during its first annual international conference which was to be held in the [[Netherlands]]. The theme of this first conference was “''Security in 2020 in a Multi-Polar World''”.

===Letter of Intent===

1) The undersigned institutions of Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden, and the Baltic Defence College (later referred to as the institutions) agree to establish a society intended to further research and academic education in military arts and sciences in the broadest sense. This association is titled International Society of Military Sciences (hereafter referred to as the Society).  
 
2) The purpose of the Society is to build a network for the creation, development, exchange and diffusion of research and knowledge about war, conflict management and peace support efforts.

3) The Society will establish an annual conference, and one or more workshops per year.  Activities include communications and publications to support a research network within topics such as: war studies; military history; military technology; command and control, leadership and basic competence; law and ethics; security and defence policy and strategy; armed forces and society; and defence economics and management. These are detailed in Annex A.

4) The representatives of the member institutions constitute the Council as the highest authority governing the Society.  The Council elects a Board governing the Society.  The purpose of the Board is to initiate and coordinate the activities of the Society.  The institution hosting the annual conference provides the secretariat for the Society for the period of one year.

5) Society members commit themselves to organise and participate in various workshops, conference or working groups, with the understanding that they will endeavour to lead at least one working group or workshop and participate in at least two others.  A tentative schedule of upcoming events is attached at Annex B.
 
6) The Society will be established for the four-year term in October 2008 upon signing of Letter of Intent by the institutions, and it is announced at the First Annual Conference. 
 
7) The first Annual Conference will be held in November 2009.  Invitations to participate in the Conference and to join the Society will be distributed widely.  The Council will consider applications for new membership by compatible organizations annually. However, participation in conferences and workshops is welcomed at any time.

==Organizational Format==
The ISMS is an institutional membership organization composed of higher military educational institutions in smaller and medium seized nations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isofms.org/cms_uploads/ABon-WFeichtinger2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Membership of the ISMS is open to defence universities and colleges conducting research and teaching at the highest national level. The Charter specifically state that its members must be free to conduct research without political control and interference and they must operate in a political system with firm democratic control over the armed forces. More so, membership is by invitation only.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isofms.org/cms_uploads/CHARTER%20of%20the%20ISMS%20adopted%20June%202011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The governing body of the ISMS is the '''Council''', which is made up by one representative of each member institution. The '''Chairmanship''' of the Council is assumed by the '''ISMS Presidency'''. The Presidency of the ISMS rotates on an annual bases between the member institutions. It is the role of the Presidency to host the '''annual ISMS conference''' and act as the ''ISMS secretariat'' for the period between the annual conferences. ISMS uses a thematic '''Working Group''' division where each working group is led by a '''Chairperson'''.

The '''''Journal of the British Interplanetary Society''''' ('''''JBIS''''') is a monthly [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] that was established in 1934. The journal covers research on [[astronautics]] and [[space science]] and [[space technology|technology]], including spacecraft design, nozzle theory, launch vehicle design, mission architecture, [[space station]]s, lunar exploration, [[spacecraft propulsion]], robotic and manned exploration of the solar system, [[interstellar travel]], [[interstellar communication]]s, [[extraterrestrial intelligence]], [[philosophy]], and [[cosmology]]. It is published monthly by the [[British Interplanetary Society]].

== History ==
The journal was established in 1934 when the British Interplanetary Society was founded. The inaugural editorial stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The ultimate aim of the society, of course, is the conquest of space and thence interplanetary travel.....(the) immediate task is the stimulation of public interest in the subject of interplanetary travel and the dissemination of knowledge concerning the true nature of the difficulties which as present hinder its achievements''.&lt;ref&gt;Interplanetary A History of The British Interplanetary Society, Bob Parkinson, BIS Publication, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The first issue was only a six-page [[pamphlet]], but has the distinction of being the world's oldest surviving astronautical publication.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

{{Neolithic|258}}
The '''Levantine corridor''' is the relatively narrow strip between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the northwest and [[desert]]s to the southeast which connects [[Africa]] to [[Eurasia]]. This corridor is a land route of migrations of animals between Eurasia and Africa. In particular, it is believed that early [[hominin]]s [[Out of Africa I|spread from Africa]] to [[Eurasia]] via the Levantine corridor and [[Horn of Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Goren-Inbar, John D. Speth (eds.), "Human [[Paleoecology]] in the Levantine Corridor". 1994, {{ISBN|1-84217-155-0}} ([http://www.palarch.nl/wp-content/vos_de_j_2006_review_of_goren_inbar_n_and_jd_speth_eds_2004_human_paleoecology_in_the_levantine_corridor_published_by_oxbow_books.pdf book review])&lt;/ref&gt; The corridor is named after the [[Levant]].

The Levantine Corridor is the western part of  the [[Fertile Crescent]], the eastern part being [[Mesopotamia]].

Botanists recognize this area as a dispersal route of [[flora|plant]] species.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Yosef O. Pleistocene connections between Africa and Southwest Asia: an archaeological perspective,  ''[[African Archaeological Review]]'', 1987, vol. 5, pp. 29–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of Y-chromosome and mtDNA haplogroups suggests that during the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] periods, the Levantine corridor was more important for bi-directional human migrations between Africa and Eurasia than was the Horn of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/AJHG_2004_v74_p000-0130.pdf J.

{{Main|Tree}}
The world's '''superlative trees''' can be ranked by any factor. Records have been kept for trees with superlative height, trunk diameter or girth, canopy coverage, airspace volume, wood volume, estimated mass, and age.

==Tallest==
[[File:Redwood National Park REDW9343.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[conifer]]ous [[Sequoia sempervirens|Coast redwood]] (''Sequoia sempervirens'') is the tallest tree species on earth.]]

The heights of the tallest trees in the world have been the subject of considerable dispute and much exaggeration. Modern verified measurements with [[laser rangefinder]]s or with [[measuring tape|tape]] drop measurements made by tree climbers (such as those carried out by canopy researchers), have shown that some older [[tree height measurement]] methods are often unreliable, sometimes producing exaggerations of 5% to 15%  or more above the real height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nativetreesociety.org |title=Native Tree Society |publisher=Native Tree Society |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817101700/http://www.nativetreesociety.org/# |archive-date=2018-08-17 |access-date=2012-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical claims of trees growing to {{convert|130|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and even {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}}, are now largely disregarded as unreliable, and attributed to human error.

The largest trees are defined as having the highest wood volume in a single-stem. These trees are both tall and large in diameter and, in particular, hold a large diameter high up the trunk. Measurement is very complex, particularly if branch volume is to be included as well as the trunk volume, so measurements have only been made for a small number of trees, and generally only for the trunk. Few attempts have ever been made to include [[root]] or [[leaf]] volume.

The [[circumference|girth]] of a tree is usually much easier to measure than the height, as it is a simple matter of stretching a tape round the trunk, and pulling it taut to find the circumference. Despite this, UK tree author [[Alan Mitchell]] made the following comment about measurements of [[Taxus baccata|yew]] trees:

{{quote|The aberrations of past measurements of yews are beyond belief. For example, the tree at Tisbury has a well-defined, clean, if irregular bole at least 1.5&amp;nbsp;m long. It has been found to have a girth that dilated and shrunk in the following way: 11.28 m (1834 Loudon), 9.3&amp;nbsp;m (1892 Lowe), 10.67&amp;nbsp;m (1903 Elwes and Henry), 9.0 m (1924 E. Swanton), 9.45&amp;nbsp;m (1959 Mitchell)&amp;nbsp;... Earlier measurements have therefore been omitted.|Alan Mitchell; in a handbook "''Conifers in the British Isles''".&lt;ref name=afm2/&gt;}}

As a general standard, tree girth is taken at "breast height". This is converted to and cited as '''dbh''' ([[diameter at breast height]]) in tree and forestry literature.&lt;ref name=afm/&gt;&lt;ref name=hamilton/&gt; Breast height is defined differently in different situations, with most [[forestry]] measurements taking girth at 1.3 m above ground,&lt;ref name=hamilton&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=G. J.|year=1975|title=Forest Mensuration Handbook|publisher=Forestry Commission Booklet|volume=39|isbn=0-11-710023-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; while those who measure [[ornamental plant|ornamental trees]] usually measure at 1.5 m above ground;&lt;ref name=afm/&gt; in most cases this makes little difference to the measured girth. On sloping ground, the "above ground" reference point is usually taken as the highest point on the ground touching the trunk,&lt;ref name=afm&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=A. F.|year=1974|title=A Field Guide to the Trees of Britain and Northern Europe|publisher=Collins|isbn=0-00-212035-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hamilton/&gt; but in North America a point, that is the average of the highest point and the lowest point the tree trunk appears to contact the soil, is usually used.&lt;ref name=NTS_measuring_guidelines&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nativetreesociety.org/measure/Tree_Measuring_Guidelines-revised1.pdf |title=Tree Measuring Guidelines of the Eastern Native Tree Society |publisher=Native Tree Society |date= March 2008|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the inflated old measurements may have been taken at ground level. Some past exaggerated measurements also result from measuring the complete next-to-bark measurement, pushing the tape in and out over every crevice and buttress.&lt;ref name=afm2&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=A. F.|year=1972|title=Conifers in the British Isles|publisher=Forestry Commission|id=Booklet 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measurements could also be influenced by deviation of the tape measure from a horizontal plane (which might seem called for if the trunk does not grow straight up), and the presence of features such as branches, spikes, ''etc''.

Modern trends are to cite the tree's [[diameter]] rather than the circumference. The diameter of the tree is calculated by finding the mean diameter of the trunk, in most cases obtained by dividing the measured circumference by [[pi|π]]; this assumes the trunk is mostly circular in cross-section (an oval or irregular cross-section would result in a mean diameter slightly greater than the assumed circle). Accurately measuring circumference or diameter is difficult in species with the large buttresses that are characteristic of many species of rainforest trees. Simple measurement of circumference of such trees can be misleading when the circumference includes much empty space between buttresses. See also [[Tree girth measurement]]

[[Baobab]]s (genus ''Adansonia'') store large amounts of [[water]] in the very soft wood in their trunks. This leads to marked variation in their girth over the year (though not more than about 2.5%&lt;ref name=Fenner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fenner|first=M|year=1980|title=Some measurements on the water relations of baobab trees|journal=Biotropica|volume=12|pages=205–209|issue=3|doi=10.2307/2387972|jstor=2387972}}&lt;/ref&gt;), reaching maximum at the end of the rainy season, and minimum at the end of the dry season.

Measurements become ambiguous when multiple trunks (whether from an individual tree or multiple trees) grow together.
The [[Sacred Fig]] grows adventitious roots from its branches, which become new trunks when the root reaches the ground and thickens; a single sacred fig tree can have hundreds of such trunks.&lt;ref name=rhs&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Huxley |editor-first=A |year=1992 |title=New RHS Dictionary of Gardening |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0-333-47494-5 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multi-stemmed [[Hundred Horse Chestnut]] was known to have a circumference of {{convert|57.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} when it was measured in 1780.

There are known more than 50 species of trees exceeding the diameter of 4.45 m or circumference of 14 m.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Oldest==
[[File:Big bristlecone pine Pinus longaeva.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Pinus longaeva|Great Basin bristlecone pine]] (''Pinus longaeva'') is the longest living tree species on earth.]]

{{Main|List of oldest trees}}
The [[list of long-living organisms|oldest]] trees are determined by [[Dendrochronology|growth rings]], which can be seen if the tree is cut down, or in cores taken from the bark to the center of the tree. Accurate determination is only possible for trees that produce growth rings, generally those in seasonal climates. Trees in uniform non-seasonal tropical climates grow continuously and do not have distinct growth rings. It is also only possible for trees that are solid to the center. Many very old trees become hollow as the dead [[heartwood]] decays. For some of these species, age estimates have been made on the basis of extrapolating current growth rates, but the results are usually largely speculation. White (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=J|year=1990|title=Estimating the Age of Large and Veteran Trees in Britain|publisher=Forestry Commission|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes a method of estimating the age of large and veteran trees in the [[United Kingdom]] through the correlation of a tree's age with its diameter and growth character.

The verified oldest measured ages are:

The oldest known European Yew may be the [[Llangernyw Yew]] in the Churchyard of [[Llangernyw]] village in [[North Wales]], or the [[Fortingall Yew]] in [[Perthshire]], Scotland.

The pond cypress, ''[[Taxodium ascendens]]'', has been known to live more than 1,000 years. One specimen in particular, named "The Senator", was estimated to be more than 3,400 years old at the time of its demise in early 2012.

==Thickest tree limbs==
This list is limited to horizontal or nearly horizontal limbs, in which the governing growth factor is phototropism. Vertical or near vertical limbs, in which the governing growth factor is negative geotropism, are called "reiterations" and are really divisions of the trunk, which by definition must be less than the trunk as a whole and therefore less remarkable. The thickest trunks have already been dealt with under "stoutest".{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

A '''Lyman-alpha emitter''' ('''LAE''') is a type of distant [[galaxy]] that emits [[Lyman series|Lyman-alpha radiation]] from neutral hydrogen.

Most known LAEs are extremely distant, and because of the finite travel time of light they provide glimpses into the history of the universe. They are thought to be the progenitors of most modern [[Milky Way]] type galaxies.  These galaxies can be found nowadays rather easily in narrow-band searches by an excess of their narrow-band flux at a wavelength which may be interpreted as their [[redshift]]:
:&lt;math&gt; 1+z=\frac{\lambda}{1215.67\mathrm{\AA}} &lt;/math&gt;
where z is the redshift, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the observed wavelength, and 1215.67 Å is the wavelength of Lyman-alpha emission.  The Lyman-alpha line in most LAEs is thought to be caused by recombination of interstellar hydrogen that is ionized by an ongoing burst of star-formation.  Such Lyman alpha emission was first suggested as a signature of young galaxies by Bruce Partridge and [[Jim Peebles|P. J. E. Peebles]] in 1967&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Partridge|first=R. B.|last2=Peebles|first2=P. J. E.|date=1967|title=Are Young Galaxies Visible?|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1967ApJ...147..868P|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|language=en|volume=147|pages=868|doi=10.1086/149079|issn=0004-637X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.   Experimental observations of the redshift of LAEs are important in [[cosmology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=0711.2199|title=The Lyman-alpha Emission Line as a Cosmological Tool|author1=Nilsson|class=astro-ph|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; because they trace [[dark matter]] halos and subsequently the evolution of matter distribution in the universe.

== Properties ==
Lyman-alpha emitters are typically low mass galaxies of 10^8 or 10^10 solar masses. They are typically young galaxies that are 200 to 600 million years old, and they have the highest specific star formation rate of any galaxies known. All of these properties indicate that Lyman-alpha emitters are important clues as to the progenitors of modern Milky Way type galaxies.

Lyman-alpha emitters have many unknown properties.  The Lyman-alpha photon escape fraction varies greatly in these galaxies. This is what portion of the light emitted at the Lyman-alpha line wavelength inside the galaxy actually escapes and will be visible to distant observers. There is much evidence that the dust content of these galaxies could be significant and therefore is obscuring the brightness of these galaxies. It is also possible that anisotropic distribution of hydrogen density and velocity play a significant role in the varying escape fraction due to the photons' continued interaction with the hydrogen gas ([[radiative transfer]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1405] Anisotropic Lyman-alpha Emission&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence now shows strong evolution in the Lyman Alpha escape fraction with redshift, most likely associated with the buildup of dust in the [[Interstellar medium|ISM]]. Dust is shown to be the main parameter setting the escape of Lyman Alpha photons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AAS...21942413B] HETDEX: Evolution of Lyman Alpha Emitters&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally the [[metallicity]], outflows, and detailed evolution with redshift is unknown.

== Importance in cosmology ==
LAEs are important probes of reionization
,&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.4235] Evolution of the observed Ly-alpha luminosity function from z = 6.5 to z = 7.7: evidence for the epoch of reionization ?&lt;/ref&gt; cosmology ([[Baryon acoustic oscillations|BAO]]), and they allow probing of the faint end of the luminosity function at high redshift.

The baryonic acoustic oscillation signal should be evident in the power spectrum of Lyman-alpha emitters at high redshift.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imprs-astro.mpg.de/sites/default/files/Ralf_Koehler_2009.pdf] Constraining Cosmology with
Lyman-alpha Emitters
a Study Using HETDEX Parameters&lt;/ref&gt; Baryonic acoustic oscillations are imprints of sound waves on scales where radiation pressure stabilized the density perturbations against gravitational collapse in the early universe. The three-dimensional distribution of the characteristically homogeneous Lyman-alpha galaxy population will allow a robust probe of cosmology. They are a good tool because the Lyman-alpha bias, the propensity for galaxies to form in the highest overdensity of the underlying dark matter distribution, can be modeled and accounted for.  Lyman-alpha emitters are over dense in clusters.

'''Malinchism''' ({{lang-es|malinchismo}}) or '''malinchist''' ({{lang-es|malinchista}}) is a form of attraction that the foreigner has in the popular imagination, causing individuals to lose the spirit of nationality by moving to the other side, a particular case of [[cultural cringe]].&lt;ref&gt;LEMOS, M. T. T. B. (Org.), DANTAS, Alexis Toribio (Org.), ''América: Visões e Versões - Identidades em confronto'', ed. 7 Letras, 1st edn., Rio, 2010, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the name of [[Hernán Cortés]]'s [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] advisor [[La Malinche]], referring to a deep-rooted Mexican inferiority complex or [[self-hatred]] for the preference for all things foreign to the point of self-destruction.{{sfn|Butler|2004|p=83}} La Malinche is used as a symbol for being supposed to have assisted the Spaniards in destroying Native Americans' way of life, values, norms and culture and exploit the Native American peoples.

"Malinchism" is a pejorative label, expressing disdain for those who are attracted by foreign values, thinking them superior, of better quality and worthy of imitation. In [[Mexico]] and in other countries the term "malinchism" or "malinchist" applies to all those who feel an attraction to foreign cultures and disregard for their own national culture. It also applies to politics, as in [[El Salvador]], in which the leftist political parties call their opponents "malinchist right-wing". The myth of [[Malinche]] and the force of this feeling of disgust crossed the Mexican border, and malinchism came to be applied as a technical term, political, for giving preference to foreign cultures.&lt;ref&gt;LEMOS, M. T. T. B. (Org.), DANTAS, Alexis Toribio (Org.), ''América: Visões e Versões - Identidades em confronto'', ed. 7 Letras, 1st edn., Rio, 2010, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that upper-class consumers in Mexico display malinchism in their preference for American imports, rather than local Mexican brands. As result, American products are sold mostly on the middle class market, and their advertising agencies generally avoid working class and rural areas.

In [[computer architecture]], the '''memory hierarchy''' separates [[computer storage]] into a hierarchy based on response time. Since response time, complexity, and capacity are related, the levels may also be distinguished by their performance and controlling technologies.&lt;ref name="toyzee" /&gt; Memory hierarchy affects performance in computer architectural design, algorithm predictions, and lower level [[computer programming|programming]] constructs involving [[locality of reference]]. 

Designing for high performance requires considering the restrictions of the memory hierarchy, i.e. the size and capabilities of each component. Each of the various components can be viewed as part of a hierarchy of memories (m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,m&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) in which each member m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is typically smaller and faster than the next highest member m&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt; of the hierarchy. To limit waiting by higher levels, a lower level will respond by filling a buffer and then signaling to activate the transfer.

There are four major storage levels.&lt;ref name="toyzee"&gt;{{cite book

This is a general memory hierarchy structuring. Many other structures are useful.  For example, a paging algorithm may be considered as a level for [[virtual memory]] when designing a [[computer architecture]], and one can include a level of [[nearline storage]] between online and offline storage.

The number of levels in the memory hierarchy and the performance at each level has increased over time.

* [[Offline storage]]

The lower levels of the hierarchy – from disks downwards – are also known as [[tiered storage]]. The formal distinction between online, nearline, and offline storage is:&lt;ref name="pearson2010"&gt;{{cite web |last=Pearson |first=Tony |year=2010 |url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/InsideSystemStorage/entry/the_correct_use_of_the_term_nearline2 |title=Correct use of the term Nearline. |work=IBM Developerworks, Inside System Storage |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Online storage is immediately available for I/O.
* Nearline storage is not immediately available, but can be made online quickly without human intervention.
* Offline storage is not immediately available, and requires some human intervention to bring online.

For example, always-on spinning disks are online, while spinning disks that spin-down, such as massive array of idle disk ([[MAID]]), are nearline. Removable media such as tape cartridges that can be automatically loaded, as in a [[tape library]], are nearline, while cartridges that must be manually loaded are offline.

Most modern [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] are so fast that for most program workloads, the [[wikt:bottleneck|bottleneck]] is the [[locality of reference]] of memory accesses and the efficiency of the [[CPU cache|caching]] and memory transfer between different levels of the hierarchy{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. As a result, the CPU spends much of its time idling, waiting for memory I/O to complete.  This is sometimes called the ''space cost'', as a larger memory object is more likely to overflow a small/fast level and require use of a larger/slower level. The resulting load on memory use is known as ''pressure'' (respectively ''register pressure'', ''cache pressure'', and (main) ''memory pressure''). Terms for data being missing from a higher level and needing to be fetched from a lower level are, respectively: [[register spilling]] (due to [[register pressure]]: register to cache), [[cache miss]] (cache to main memory), and (hard) [[page fault]] (main memory to disk).

Modern [[programming language]]s mainly assume two levels of memory, main memory and disk storage, though in [[assembly language]] and [[inline assembler]]s in languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]], registers can be directly accessed. Taking optimal advantage of the memory hierarchy requires the cooperation of programmers, hardware, and compilers (as well as underlying support from the operating system):
*'''Programmers''' are responsible for moving data between disk and memory through file I/O.
*'''Hardware''' is responsible for moving data between memory and caches.
*'''[[Compiler optimization|Optimizing compilers]]''' are responsible for generating code that, when executed, will cause the hardware to use caches and registers efficiently.

Many programmers assume one level of memory.  This works fine until the application hits a performance wall.  Then the memory hierarchy will be assessed during [[code refactoring]].

==Definitions==
This higher-level cognition was given the label metacognition by American developmental psychologist [[John H. Flavell]] (1976).

The term metacognition literally means 'beyond cognition', and is used to indicate cognition about cognition, or more informally, thinking about thinking. Flavell defined metacognition as knowledge about cognition and control of cognition. For example, a person is engaging in metacognition if he notices that he is having more trouble learning A than B, or if it strikes him that he should double-check C before accepting it as fact. J. H. Flavell (1976, p.&amp;nbsp;232).  [[Andreas Demetriou]]'s theory (one of the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]]) used the term hypercognition to refer to self-monitoring, self-representation, and self-regulation processes, which are regarded as integral components of the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A., Efklides, A., &amp; Platsidou, M. (1993). The architecture and dynamics of developing mind: Experiential structuralism as a frame for unifying cognitive developmental theories. ''Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 58'', Serial Number 234.
&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, with his colleagues, he showed that these processes participate in general [[intelligence]], together with processing efficiency and reasoning, which have traditionally been considered to compose [[fluid intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 =Demetriou|first1 = A.|last2 = Kazi|first2 = S.|year = 2006|title = Self-awareness in g (with processing efficiency and reasoning)|url=|journal=Intelligence|volume = 34|issue =3|pages = 297–317|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2005.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metacognition also involves thinking about one's own thinking process such as study skills, memory capabilities, and the ability to monitor learning.  This concept needs to be explicitly taught along with content instruction.
Metacognitive knowledge is about one's own cognitive processes and the understanding of how to regulate those processes to maximize learning.

Some types of metacognitive knowledge would include:
* Content knowledge (declarative knowledge) which is understanding one's own capabilities, such as a student evaluating his/her own knowledge of a subject in a class. It is notable that not all metacognition is accurate. Studies have shown that students often mistake lack of effort with understanding in evaluating themselves and their overall knowledge of a concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://images.pearsonassessments.com/images/tmrs/metacognition_literature_review_final.pdf|title=Metacognition: A Literature Review|last=Lai|first=Emily|date=April 2011|website=Metacognition: A Literature Review PDF|format=PDF|access-date=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, greater confidence in having performed well  is associated with less accurate metacognitive judgment of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molenberghs|first=Pascal|last2=Trautwein|first2=Fynn-Mathis|last3=Böckler|first3=Anne|last4=Singer|first4=Tania|last5=Kanske|first5=Philipp|date=2016-12-01|title=Neural correlates of metacognitive ability and of feeling confident: a large-scale fMRI study|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|volume=11|issue=12|pages=1942–1951|doi=10.1093/scan/nsw093|issn=1749-5024|pmc=5141950|pmid=27445213}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Task knowledge (procedural knowledge), which is how one perceives the difficulty of a task which is the content, length, and the type of assignment. The study mentioned in Content knowledge also deals with a person's ability to evaluate the difficulty of a task related to their overall performance on the task. Again, the accuracy of this knowledge was skewed as students who thought their way was better/easier also seemed to perform worse on evaluations, while students who were rigorously and continually evaluated reported to not be as confident but still did better on initial evaluations.
* Strategic knowledge (conditional knowledge) which is one's own capability for using strategies to learn information. Young children are not particularly good at this; it is not until students are in upper elementary school that they begin to develop an understanding of effective strategies.
Metacognition is a general term encompassing the study of memory-monitoring and self-regulation, meta-reasoning, [[consciousness]]/[[awareness]] and auto-consciousness/[[self-awareness]]. In practice these capacities are used to regulate one's own cognition, to maximize one's potential to think, [[learning|learn]] and to the evaluation of proper [[ethics|ethical]]/[[Morality|moral rules]]. It can also lead to a reduction in response time for a given situation as a result of heightened awareness, and potentially reduce the time to complete problems or tasks.

In the domain of experimental psychology, an influential distinction in metacognition (proposed by T. O. Nelson &amp; L. Narens) is between Monitoring&amp;mdash;making judgments about the strength of one's memories&amp;mdash;and Control&amp;mdash;using those judgments to guide behavior (in particular, to guide study choices). Dunlosky, Serra, and Baker (2007) covered this distinction in a review of metamemory research that focused on how findings from this domain can be applied to other areas of applied research.

In the domain of [[cognitive neuroscience]], metacognitive monitoring and control has been viewed as a function of the [[prefrontal cortex]], which receives (monitors) sensory signals from other cortical regions and  implements control using feedback loops(see chapters by Schwartz &amp; Bacon and Shimamura, in Dunlosky &amp; Bjork, 2008).&lt;ref name="Dunlosky"/&gt;

Metacognition is studied in the domain of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[Scientific modelling|modelling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.artint.2005.10.009 | volume=169 | issue=2 | title=Metacognition in computation: A selected research review | journal=Artificial Intelligence | pages=104–141| year=2005 | last1=Cox | first1=Michael T. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is the domain of interest of emergent [[systemics]].

It has been used, albeit off the original definition, to describe one's own knowledge that we will die. Writers in the 1990s involved with the [[grunge]] music scene often used the term to describe self-awareness of mortality.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Components==
Metacognition is classified into three components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flavell|first=J.H.|title=Metacognition and cognitive monitoring. A new area of cognitive-development inquiry|journal=American Psychologist|year=1979|volume=34|pages=906–911|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.34.10.906|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Metacognitive knowledge'' (also called metacognitive awareness) is what individuals know about themselves and others as cognitive processors.
# ''Metacognitive regulation'' is the regulation of cognition and learning experiences through a set of activities that help people control their learning.
# ''Metacognitive experiences'' are those experiences that have something to do with the current, on-going cognitive endeavor.

Metacognition refers to a level of thinking that involves active control over the process of thinking that is used in learning situations.  Planning the way to approach a learning task, monitoring comprehension, and evaluating the progress towards the completion of a task: these are skills that are metacognitive in their nature.

Metacognition includes at least three different types of metacognitive awareness when considering metacognitive knowledge:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=J.E.|author2=Paris, S.G.|title=Children's metacognition about reading: Issues in definition, measurement, and instruction|journal=[[Educational Psychologist (journal)|Educational Psychologist]]|year=1987|volume=22|pages=225–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''Declarative knowledge'': refers to knowledge about oneself as a learner and about what factors can influence one's performance.&lt;ref name="Schraw 1998 113–125"/&gt; Declarative knowledge can also be referred to as "world knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=W|author2=Artelt, C.|title=Metacognition and mathematics education|journal=ZDM Mathematics Education|year=2010|volume=42|issue=2|pages=149–161|doi=10.1007/s11858-010-0240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Procedural knowledge'': refers to knowledge about doing things. This type of knowledge is displayed as heuristics and strategies.&lt;ref name="Schraw 1998 113–125"/&gt; A high degree of procedural knowledge can allow individuals to perform tasks more automatically. This is achieved through a large variety of strategies that can be accessed more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pressley|first=M |author2=Borkowski, J.G. |author3=Schneider, W.|title=Cognitive strategies: Good strategy users coordinate metacognition and knowledge|journal=Annals of Child Development|year=1987|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Conditional knowledge'': refers to knowing when and why to use declarative and procedural knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garner|first=R|title=When children and adults do not use learning strategies: Toward a theory of settings|journal=Review of Educational Research|year=1990|volume=60|pages=517–529|doi=10.3102/00346543060004517|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows students to allocate their resources when using strategies. This in turn allows the strategies to become more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=R.E.|title=Selective attention and prose learning: Theoretical and empirical research|journal=[[Educational Psychology Review]]|year=1992|volume=4|pages=345–391|doi=10.1007/BF01332144|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive regulation or "regulation of cognition" contains three skills that are essential.&lt;ref name="Schraw 1998 113–125"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=J.E.|author2=Paris, S.G.|title=Children's metacognition about reading: Issues in definition, measurement, and instruction|journal=Educational Psychologist|year=1987|volume=22|issue=3–4|pages=255–278|doi=10.1080/00461520.1987.9653052}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''Planning'': refers to the appropriate selection of strategies and the correct allocation of resources that affect task performance.
# ''Monitoring'': refers to one's awareness of comprehension and task performance
# ''Evaluating'': refers to appraising the final product of a task and the efficiency at which the task was performed. This can include re-evaluating strategies that were used.

Similarly, maintaining motivation to see a task to completion is also a metacognitive skill. The ability to become aware of distracting stimuli &amp;ndash; both internal and external &amp;ndash; and sustain effort over time also involves metacognitive or [[executive functions]]. The theory that metacognition has a critical role to play in successful learning means it is important that it be demonstrated by both students and teachers.

Students who demonstrate a wide range of metacognitive skills perform better on exams and complete work more efficiently{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. They are self-regulated learners who utilize the "right tool for the job" and modify learning strategies and skills based on their awareness of effectiveness. Individuals with a high level of metacognitive knowledge and skill identify blocks to learning as early as possible and change "tools" or strategies to ensure goal attainment. Swanson (1990) found that metacognitive knowledge can compensate for IQ and lack of prior knowledge when comparing fifth and sixth grade students' problem solving. Students with a high-metacognition were reported to have used fewer strategies, but solved problems more effectively than low-metacognition students, regardless of IQ or prior knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swanson|first=H.L.|title=Influence of metacognitive knowledge and aptitude on problem solving|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=1990|volume=82|pages=306–314|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.82.2.306|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study examining students who send text messages during college lectures, it was suggested that students with higher metacognitive abilities were less likely than other students to have their learning affected by using a mobile phone in class.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, L. D., Lim, A. F., Carrier, L. M., &amp; Cheever, N. A. (2011).

Psicología Educativa, 17(2), 163-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.|[[Bertrand Russell]]}}
Metacognologists are aware of their own strengths and weaknesses, the nature of the task at hand, and available "tools" or skills. A broader repertoire of "tools" also assists in goal attainment. When "tools" are general, generic, and context independent, they are more likely to be useful in different types of learning situations.

Another distinction in metacognition is executive management and strategic knowledge. Executive management processes involve planning, monitoring, evaluating and revising one's own thinking processes and products. Strategic knowledge involves knowing ''what'' (factual or declarative knowledge), knowing ''when and why'' (conditional or contextual knowledge) and knowing ''how'' (procedural or methodological knowledge). Both executive management and strategic knowledge metacognition are needed to self-regulate one's own thinking and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, there is no distinction between domain-general and domain-specific metacognitive skills.  This means that metacognitive skills are domain-general in nature and there are no specific skills for certain subject areas. The metacognitive skills that are used to review an essay are the same as those that are used to verify an answer to a math question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gourgey|first=A.F.|title=Metacognition in basic skills instruction|journal=Instructional Science|year=1998|volume=26|pages=81–96|doi=10.1023/A:1003092414893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social Metacognition ==
Although metacognition has thus far been discussed in relation to the self, recent research in the field has suggested that this view is overly restrictive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jost|first=J. T.|last2=Kruglanski|first2=A. W.|last3=Nelson|first3=T. O.|date=1998|title=Social metacognition: an expansionist review|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review: An Official Journal of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc|volume=2|issue=2|pages=137–154|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0202_6|issn=1088-8683|pmid=15647141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it is argued that metacognition research should also include beliefs about others’ mental processes, the influence of culture on those beliefs, and on beliefs about ourselves. This “expansionist view” proposes that it is impossible to fully understand metacognition without considering the situational norms and cultural expectations that influence those same conceptions. This combination of social psychology and metacognition is referred to as social metacognition. 

Social metacognition can include ideas and perceptions that relate to [[social cognition]]. Additionally, social metacognition can include judging the cognition of others, such as judging the perceptions and emotional states of others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is in part because the process of judging others is similar to judging the self.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, individuals have less information about the people they are judging; therefore, judging others tend to be more inaccurate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tullis|first=Jonathan G.|last2=Fraundorf|first2=Scott H.|date=2017-08|title=Predicting others' memory performance: The accuracy and bases of social metacognition|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=95|pages=124–137|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2017.03.003|issn=0749-596X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having similar cognitions can buffer against this inaccuracy and can be helpful for teams or organizations, as well as interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thompson|first=Leigh|last2=Cohen|first2=Taya R.|date=2012-01-01|title=Metacognition in teams and organizations|url=https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/metacognition-in-teams-and-organizations-2|journal=Social Metacognition|pages=283–302|doi=10.4324/9780203865989|isbn=9780203865989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social Metacognition and the Self Concept ===
The self concept plays an important part in how people think about and act in their social worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scirp.org/(S(351jmbntvnsjt1aadkposzje))/reference/ReferencesPapers.aspx?ReferenceID=424661|title=Baumeister, R. F. (1998). The self. In D. T. Gilbert, S. T. Fiske, &amp; G. Lindzey (Eds.), The handbook of social psychology (4th ed., Vol. 1, pp. 635-679). Boston, MA McGraw-Hill Co., Inc. - References - Scientific Research Publishing|last=|first=|date=|website=www.scirp.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metacognitions can be divided into first order and second order thoughts. First order thoughts are the person’s first appraisal of a given thought (I am smart), while second order thoughts are their reflections about their certainty of that appraisal (I am not really sure how smart I am). These secondary cognitions are subject to the influence of culture and situational norms, and thus influence the strength of our self-convictions.

An example of the interaction between social metacognition and self-concept can be found in examining implicit theories about the self. Implicit theories can cover a wide-range of constructs about how the self operates, but two are especially relevant here; entity theory and incrementalist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dweck|first=Carol S.|last2=Chiu|first2=Chi-yue|last3=Hong|first3=Ying-yi|date=1995-10|title=Implicit Theories and Their Role in Judgments and Reactions: A Word From Two Perspectives|journal=Psychological Inquiry|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=267–285|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0604_1|issn=1047-840X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entity theory proposes that an individual’s self-attributes and abilities are fixed and stable, while incrementalist theory proposes that these same constructs can be changed through effort and experience. Entity theorists are susceptible to learned helplessness because they may feel that circumstances are outside their control (i.e. there’s nothing that could have been done to make things better), thus they may give up easily. Incremental theorists react differently when faced with failure: they desire to master challenges, and therefore adopt a mastery-oriented pattern.  They immediately began to consider various ways that they could approach the task differently, and they increase their efforts. Cultural beliefs can act on this as well. For example, a person who has accepted a cultural belief that memory loss is an unavoidable consequence of old age may avoid cognitively demanding tasks as they age, thus accelerating cognitive decline.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=B.|last2=Langer|first2=E.|date=1994-6|title=Aging free from negative stereotypes: successful memory in China and among the American deaf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=66|issue=6|pages=989–997|issn=0022-3514|pmid=8046582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a female who is aware of the stereotype that purports that females are not good at mathematics may perform worse on tests of mathematical ability or avoid mathematics altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steele|first=Jennifer R.|last2=Ambady|first2=Nalini|date=2006-07|title="Math is Hard!" The effect of gender priming on women's attitudes|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=42|issue=4|pages=428–436|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.06.003|issn=0022-1031}}&lt;/ref&gt; These examples demonstrate that the metacognitive beliefs people hold about the self - which may be socially or culturally transmitted - can have important effects on persistence, performance, and motivation.

=== Attitudes as a Function of Social Metacognition ===
The way that individuals think about attitude greatly affects the way that they behave. Metacognitions about attitudes influence how individuals act, and especially how they interact with others.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9780203865989|title=Social Metacognition|last=Briñol|first=Pablo|date=2012-04-27|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780203865989|location=|pages=21–42|language=en|doi=10.4324/9780203865989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some metacognitive characteristics of attitudes include importance, certainty, and perceived knowledge, and they influence behavior in different ways.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Attitude importance is the strongest predictor of behavior and can predict information seeking behaviors in individuals. Attitude importance is also more likely to influence behavior than certainty of the attitude.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When considering a social behavior like voting a person may hold high importance but low certainty. This means that they will likely vote, even if they are unsure who to vote for. Meanwhile, a person who is very certain of who they want to vote for, may not actually vote if it is of low importance to them. This also applies to interpersonal relationships. A person might hold a lot of favorable knowledge about their family, but they may not maintain close relations with their family if it is of low importance.

Metacognitive characteristics of attitudes may be key to understanding how attitudes change. Research shows that the frequency of positive or negative thoughts is the biggest factor in attitude change.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9780203865989|title=Social Metacognition|last=Briñol|first=Pablo|date=2012-04-27|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780203865989|location=|pages=43 – 62|language=en|doi=10.4324/9780203865989}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person may believe that climate change is occurring but have negative thoughts toward it such as “If I accept the responsibilities of climate change, I must change my lifestyle.” These individuals would not likely change their behavior compared to someone that thinks positively about the same issue such as “By using less electricity, I will be helping the planet.”

Another way to increase the likelihood of behavior change is by influencing the source of the attitude. An individual’s personal thoughts and ideas have a much greater impact on the attitude compared ideas of others.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, when people view lifestyle changes as coming from themselves, the effects are more powerful than if the changes were coming from a friend or family member. These thoughts can be re-framed that emphasizes personal importance, such as “I want to stop smoking because it is important to me” rather than “quitting smoking is important to my family”. More research needs to be conducted on culture differences and importance of group ideology, which may alter these results.

=== Social Metacognition and Stereotypes ===
People have secondary cognitions about the appropriateness, justifiability, and social judgability of their own stereotypic beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Metacognition|last=Briñol|first=Pablo|date=2012-04-27|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780203865989|location=|pages=243–262|language=en|doi=10.4324/9780203865989}}&lt;/ref&gt; People know that it is typically unacceptable to make stereotypical judgments and make conscious efforts not to do so. Subtle social cues can influence these conscious efforts. For example, when given a false sense of confidence about their ability to judge others, people will return to relying on social stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yzerbyt|first=Vincent Y.|last2=Schadron|first2=Georges|last3=Leyens|first3=Jacques-Philippe|last4=Rocher|first4=Stephan|date=1994|title=Social judgeability: The impact of meta-informational cues on the use of stereotypes.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=66|issue=1|pages=48–55|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.1.48|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural backgrounds influence social metacognitive assumptions, including stereotypes. For example, cultures without the stereotype that memory declines with old age display no age differences in memory performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

When it comes to making judgments about other people, implicit theories about the stability versus malleability of human characteristics predict differences in social stereotyping as well. Holding an entity theory of traits increases the tendency for people to see similarity among group members and utilize stereotyped judgments. For example, compared to those holding incremental beliefs, people who hold entity beliefs of traits use more stereotypical trait judgments of ethnic and occupational groups as well as form more extreme trait judgments of new groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plaks|first=Jason E.|last2=Stroessner|first2=Steven J.|last3=Dweck|first3=Carol S.|last4=Sherman|first4=Jeffrey W.|date=2001|title=Person theories and attention allocation: Preferences for stereotypic versus counterstereotypic information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=80|issue=6|pages=876–893|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.6.876|issn=1939-1315|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/7sb722b1|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; When individual’s assumptions about a group combine with their implicit theories, more stereotypical judgments may be form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yzerbyt|first=Vincent|last2=Corneille|first2=Olivier|last3=Estrada|first3=Claudia|date=2001-05|title=The Interplay of Subjective Essentialism and Entitativity in the Formation of Stereotypes|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=141–155|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0502_5|issn=1088-8683|citeseerx=10.1.1.379.4076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypes that one believes others hold about them are called metastereotypes.

==Relation to sapience==
Metacognologists believe that the ability to consciously think about thinking is unique to [[sapience|sapient]] species and indeed is one of the definitions of sapience.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} There is evidence that [[Rhesus macaque|rhesus monkeys]], apes, and dolphins can make accurate judgments about the strengths of their memories of fact and monitor their own uncertainty,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1037/a0020129|last = Couchman|first = Justin J.|author2=Coutinho, M.

==Strategies==
Metacognitive-like processes are especially ubiquitous when it comes to the discussion of [[self-regulated learning]]. Being engaged in metacognition is a salient feature of good self-regulated learners.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Reinforcing collective discussion of metacognition is a salient feature of self-critical and self-regulating social groups.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  The activities of strategy selection and application include those concerned with an ongoing attempt to plan, check, monitor, select, revise, evaluate, etc.

Metacognition is 'stable' in that learners' initial decisions derive from the pertinent facts about their cognition through years of learning experience. Simultaneously, it is also 'situated' in the sense that it depends on learners' familiarity with the task, motivation, emotion, and so forth. Individuals need to regulate their thoughts about the strategy they are using and adjust it based on the situation to which the strategy is being applied.  At a professional level, this has led to emphasis on the development of [[reflective practice]], particularly in the education and health-care professions.

Recently, the notion has been applied to the study of second language learners in the field of [[English as a foreign or second language|TESOL]] and [[applied linguistics]] in general (e.g., Wenden, 1987; Zhang, 2001, 2010). This new development has been much related to Flavell (1979), where the notion of metacognition is elaborated within a tripartite theoretical framework. Learner metacognition is defined and investigated by examining their person knowledge, task knowledge and strategy knowledge.

Wenden (1991) has proposed and used this framework and Zhang (2001) has adopted this approach and investigated second language learners' metacognition or metacognitive knowledge. In addition to exploring the relationships between learner metacognition and performance, researchers are also interested in the effects of metacognitively-oriented strategic instruction on reading comprehension (e.g., Garner, 1994, in first language contexts, and Chamot, 2005; Zhang, 2010). The efforts are aimed at developing [[learner autonomy]], [[interdependence]] and [[Self-regulated learning|self-regulation]].

Metacognition helps people to perform many cognitive tasks more effectively.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt; Strategies for promoting metacognition include self-questioning (e.g. "What do I already know about this topic? How have I solved problems like this before?"), thinking aloud while performing a task, and making graphic representations (e.g. concept maps, flow charts, semantic webs) of one's thoughts and knowledge.  Carr, 2002, argues that the physical act of writing plays a large part in the development of metacognitive skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gammil | first1 = D. | year = 2006 | title = Learning the Write Way | url = | journal = The Reading Teacher | volume = 59 | issue = 8| pages = 754–762 | doi = 10.1598/RT.59.8.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategy Evaluation matrices (SEM) can help to improve the ''knowledge of cognition'' component of metacognition.  The SEM works by identifying the declarative (Column 1), procedural (Column 2) and conditional (Column 3 and 4) knowledge about specific strategies.  The SEM can help individuals identify the strength and weaknesses about certain strategies as well as introduce them to new strategies that they can add to their repertoire.&lt;ref name="Schraw1998a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schraw|first=Gregory|title=Promoting general metacogntive awareness|journal=Instructional Science|year=1998|volume=26|pages=113–125|doi=10.1023/A:1003044231033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A regulation checklist (RC) is a useful strategy for improving the regulation of cognition aspect of one's metacognition. RCs help individuals to implement a sequence of thoughts that allow them to go over their own metacognition.&lt;ref name="Schraw1998a"/&gt; King (1991) found that fifth-grade students who used a regulation checklist outperformed control students when looking at a variety of questions including written problem solving, asking strategic questions, and elaborating information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=A|title=Effects of training in strategic questioning on children's problem solving performance|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=1991|volume=83|pages=307–317|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.83.3.307|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of strategies that can be taught to students are word analysis skills, active reading strategies, listening skills, organizational skills and creating mnemonic devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=L|author2=Thompson, M.|title=Neurofeedback combined with training in metacognitive strategies: Effectiveness in students with ADD|journal=Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback|year=1998|volume=23|issue=4|pages=243–63|doi=10.1023/A:1022213731956|pmid=10457815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker and Walker have developed a model of metacognition in school learning termed [[Steering cognition|Steering Cognition]].  [[Steering cognition|Steering Cognition]] describes the capacity of the mind to exert conscious control over its reasoning and processing strategies in relation to the external learning task. Studies have shown that pupils with an ability to exert metacognitive regulation over their attentional and reasoning strategies used when engaged in maths, and then shift those strategies when engaged in science or then English literature learning, associate with higher academic outcomes at secondary school.

==Metastrategic knowledge==
"Metastrategic knowledge" (MSK) is a sub-component of metacognition that is defined as general knowledge about higher order thinking strategies. MSK had been defined as "general knowledge about the cognitive procedures that are being manipulated". The knowledge involved in MSK consists of "making generalizations and drawing rules regarding a thinking strategy" and of "naming" the thinking strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, A., &amp; Ben David, A. (2009). Paving a clear path in a thick forest: A conceptual analysis of a metacognitive component. Metacognition And Learning, 4(3), 177-195. {{DOI|10.1007/s11409-009-9044-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The important conscious act of a metastrategic strategy is the "conscious" awareness that one is performing a form of higher order thinking. MSK is an awareness of the type of thinking strategies being used in specific instances and it consists of the following abilities: making generalizations and drawing rules regarding a thinking strategy, naming the thinking strategy, explaining when, why and how such a thinking strategy should be used, when it should not be used, what are the disadvantages of not using appropriate strategies, and what task characteristics call for the use of the strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Veenman, M. V. J. (2006). Metacognition: Definitions, constituents, and their intricate relation with cognition. Symposium organized by Marcel V. J. Veenman, Anat Zohar, and Anastasia Efklides for the 2nd conference of the EARLI SIG on Metacognition (SIG 16), Cambridge, UK, 19–21 July.&lt;/ref&gt;

MSK deals with the broader picture of the conceptual problem. It creates rules to describe and understand the physical world around the people who utilize these processes called [[higher-order thinking]]. This is the capability of the individual to take apart complex problems in order to understand the components in problem. These are the building blocks to understanding the "big picture" (of the main problem) through reflection and problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;Beer, N., &amp; Moneta, G. B. (2012). Coping and perceived stress as a function of positive metacognitions and positive meta-emotions. Individual Differences Research, 10(2), 105–116.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Action==

Both social and cognitive dimensions of sporting expertise can be adequately explained from a metacognitive perspective according to recent research. The potential of metacognitive inferences and domain-general skills including psychological skills training  are  integral to the genesis of expert performance. Moreover, the contribution of both mental imagery (e.g., mental practice) and attentional strategies (e.g., routines) to our understanding of expertise and metacognition is noteworthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacIntyre | first1 = TE | last2 = Igou | first2 = ER | last3 = Campbell | first3 = MJ | last4 = Moran | first4 = AP | last5 = Matthews | first5 = J | year = 2014 | title = Metacognition and action: a new pathway to understanding social and cognitive aspects of expertise in sport | url = | journal = Front.

The potential of metacognition to illuminate our understanding of action was first highlighted by Aidan Moran who discussed the role of meta-attention in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Moran A. P. (1996). The Psychology of Concentration in Sport Performers: A Cognitive Analysis. Hove, East Sussex: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; A recent research initiative,  a research seminar series called [http://www.meta-research.org META] funded by the [[British Psychological Society|BPS]], is exploring the role of the related constructs of meta-motivation, meta-emotion, and thinking and action (metacognition).

==Mental illness==

===Sparks of interest===
In the context of mental health, metacognition can be loosely defined as the process that "reinforces one's subjective sense of being a self and allows for becoming aware that some of one's thoughts and feelings are symptoms of an illness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lysaker, P. H.|author2=Dimaggio, G.|author3=Buck, K. D.|author4=Callaway, S. S.|author5=Salvatore, G.|author6=Carcione, A.|author7=Stanghellini, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2011|title=Poor insight in schizophrenia: Links between different forms of metacognition with awareness of symptoms, treatment needed, and consequences of illness|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|volume=52|issue=3|pages=253–60|pmid= 21497218|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2010.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in metacognition emerged from a concern for an individual's ability to understand their own mental status compared to others as well as the ability to cope with the source of their distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Semerari | first1 = A. | last2 = Carcione | first2 = A. | last3 = Dimaggio | first3 = G. | last4 = Falcone | first4 = M. | last5 = Nicol | first5 = G. | last6 = Procacci | first6 = M. | last7 = Alleva | first7 = G. | year = 2003 | title = How to evaluate Metacognitive function in psychotherapy? The Metacognition Assessment Scale and its applications | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 238–261 | doi=10.1002/cpp.362}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[insights]] into an individual's mental health status can have a profound effect on the over-all prognosis and recovery.
Metacognition brings many unique insights into the normal daily functioning of a human being. It also demonstrates that a lack of these insights compromises 'normal' functioning. This leads to less healthy functioning. In the [[autism]] spectrum, there is a profound deficit in [[Theory of Mind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lysaker, P. H.|author2= Dimaggio, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2011|title=Metacognitive disturbances in people with severe mental illness: Theory, correlates with psychopathology and models of psychotherapy|journal=Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice|volume=84|issue=1|pages= 1–8|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8341.2010.02007.x|pmid=22903827}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In people who identify as alcoholics, there is a belief that the need to control cognitions is an independent predictor of alcohol use over anxiety. Alcohol may be used as a coping strategy for controlling unwanted thoughts and emotions formed by negative perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spada | first1 = M. M. | last2 = Zandvoort | first2 = M. | last3 = Wells | first3 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Metacognitions in problem drinkers | url = | journal = Cognitive Therapy and Research | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 709–716 | doi = 10.1007/s10608-006-9066-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes referred to as [[self medication]].

===Implications===

Wells' and Matthews'&lt;ref&gt;Wells, A. &amp; Mathews, G. (1997). Attention and Emotion. A clinical perspective. Hove, UK: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; theory proposes that when faced with an undesired choice, an individual can operate in two distinct modes: "object" and "metacognitive". Object mode interprets perceived stimuli as truth, where metacognitive mode understands thoughts as cues that have to be weighted and evaluated. They are not as easily trusted. There are targeted interventions unique of each patient, that gives rise to the belief that assistance in increasing metacognition in people diagnosed with schizophrenia is possible through tailored psychotherapy. With a customized therapy in place clients then have the potential to develop greater ability to engage in complex self-reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lysaker | first1 = P. H. | last2 = Buck | first2 = K. D. | last3 = Carcione | first3 = A. | last4 = Procacci | first4 = M. | last5 = Salvatore | first5 = G. | last6 = Nicolò | first6 = G. | last7 = Dimaggio | first7 = G. | year = 2011 | title = Addressing metacognitive capacity for self-reflection in the psychotherapy for schizophrenia: A conceptual model of the key tasks and processes | url = | journal = Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice | volume = 84 | issue = 1| pages = 58–69 | doi=10.1348/147608310X520436 | pmid=22903831 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can ultimately be pivotal in the patient's recovery process. In the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]], cognitive formulations have greater attention to intrusive thoughts related to the disorder. "Cognitive self-consciousness" are the tendencies to focus attention on thought. Patients with OCD exemplify varying degrees of these "intrusive thoughts". Patients also suffering from [[generalized anxiety disorder]] also show negative thought process in their cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobi | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Calamari | first2 = J. E. | last3 = Woodard | first3 = J. L. | year = 2006 | title = Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Beliefs, Metacognitive Beliefs and Obsessional Symptoms: Relations between Parent Beliefs and Child Symptoms | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 153–162 | doi = 10.1002/cpp.485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive-attentional syndrome (CAS) characterizes a metacognitive model of emotion disorder (CAS is consistent with the attention strategy of excessively focusing on the source of a threat). This ultimately develops through the client's own beliefs. [[Metacognitive therapy]] attempts to correct this change in the CAS. One of the techniques in this model is called attention training (ATT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = A | year = 1990 | title = Panic disorder in association with relaxation-induced anxiety: An attentional training approach to treatment | url = | journal = Behaviour Therapy | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 273–280 | doi=10.1016/s0005-7894(05)80330-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to diminish the worry and anxiety by a sense of control and cognitive awareness. ATT also trains clients to detect threats and test how controllable reality appears to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = A. | last2 = Fisher | first2 = P. | last3 = Myers | first3 = S. | last4 = Wheatley | first4 = J. | last5 = Patel | first5 = T. | last6 = Brewin | first6 = C.

==Works of art as metacognitive artifacts==
The concept of metacognition has also been applied to [[reader-response criticism]]. [[Narrative]] [[Work of art|works of art]], including novels, movies and musical compositions, can be characterized as metacognitive [[Cultural artifact|artifact]]s which are designed by the artist to anticipate and regulate the beliefs and cognitive processes of the recipient,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Lång, Markus | title=Teksti metakognitiivisena artefaktina: Sanataiteen ja säveltaiteen ontologiaa | journal=Synteesi | volume=17 | issue=4 | year=1998 | pages=82–94 | issn=0359-5242 | url=http://www.mlang.name/metakognitio.html | language=Finnish |trans-title=Text as a Metacognitive Artifact: Literary and Musical Ontology }}&lt;br&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Lång, Markus | title=Elokuva metakognitiivisena artefaktina: Reseptioesteettinen katsaus | journal=Synteesi | volume=21 | issue=1 | year=2002 | pages=59–65 | issn=0359-5242 | url=http://www.mlang.name/elokuva.html | language=Finnish |trans-title=Film as a metacognitive artifact: Reader-response critical review }}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, how and in which order events and their causes and identities are revealed to the reader of a detective story. As Menakhem Perry has pointed out, mere order has profound effects on the aesthetical meaning of a text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Perry, Menakhem | year=1979 | title=Literary Dynamics: How the Order of a Text Creates Its Meanings |journal=Poetics Today | volume=1 | issue=1–2 | pages=35–64, 311–361 | jstor=1772040 | doi=10.2307/1772040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative works of art contain a representation of their own ideal reception process. They are something of a tool with which the creators of the work wish to attain certain aesthetical and even moral effects.&lt;ref&gt;Lång 1998, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mind wandering==

There is an intimate, dynamic interplay between [[mind wandering]] and metacognition. Metacognition serves to correct the wandering mind, suppressing spontaneous thoughts and bringing attention back to more "worthwhile" tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kieran|first=C. R. Fox|author2=Kalina Christoff|title=Metacognitive Facilitation of Spontaneous Thought Processes: When Metacognition Helps the Wandering Mind Find Its Way|journal=The Cognitive Neuroscience of Metacognition|date=2014|pages=293–319|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-45190-4_13|isbn=978-3-642-45189-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mind-wandering and metacognition: variation between internal and external thought predicts improved error awareness|url=http://neuroconscience.com/2013/11/08/mind-wandering-and-meta-cognition-variation-between-internal-and-external-thought-predicts-improved-error-awareness/|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizational metacognition ==
The concept of metacognition has also been applied to collective teams and organizations in general, termed [[Corporate Brain|organizational metacognition]].{{Portal|Thinking}}

A '''millennium''' (plural '''millennia''' or '''millenniums''') is a period equal to [[1000 (number)|1000]] [[year]]s,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/millennium millennium]", ''Oxford Dictionaries'' (Oxford University Press, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; also called kiloyears. It derives from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|mille}}'', thousand, and ''{{lang|la|annus}}'', year. It is often, but not always, related to a particular [[calendar|dating system]].

Sometimes, it is used specifically for periods of a thousand years that begin at the starting point (initial reference point) of the calendar in consideration (typically the year "1"), or in later years that are whole number multiples of a thousand years after it. The term can also refer to an interval of time beginning on any date. Frequently in the latter case (and sometimes also in the former) it may have religious or theological implications (see [[millenarianism]]).

==Counting years==
There are two methods of counting years: current years (the count begins at the epoch) and elapsed years (the count is of completed years since the epoch).

The original method of counting years was [[ordinal number|ordinal]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} whether ''1st year [[AD]]'' or [[regnal year|regnal]] ''10th year of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]''. This ordinal numbering is still used in the names of the millennia and centuries, for example the ''1st millennium'' or the ''10th century'', and sometimes in the names of decades, e.g., ''1st decade of the 11th century''.

The main issues arise from the ''content'' of the various year ranges. Similar issues affect the ''contents'' of centuries. Decades are not subject to ambiguity, as they are named according to their leading numbers: the decade called the 1990s by its naming does not include 2000.

Those following ordinal year names naturally choose
* 2001–2100 (inclusive) as the current century
* 2001–3000 (inclusive) as the current millennium
Those who are influenced by the leading digit equally naturally choose
* 2000–2099 (inclusive) as the current century
* 2000–2999 (inclusive) as the current millennium

==Debate over millennium celebrations==
There are two viewpoints about how millennia should be thought of in practice. One viewpoint relies on the formal operation of the calendar, while the other appeals to [[Popular culture|popular culture]]. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] argued that the choice is arbitrary, and since the question revolves around rules made by people, rather than a natural phenomenon that is subject to experimental measurement, the matter cannot be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay, ''Questioning the Millennium'' (New York: Harmony Books, 1997), part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ISO 8601]], employed in [[ISO 8601 usage|a number of contexts]], uses the [[Astronomical year numbering|astronomical calendar]], in which year counting starts at 0. Thus, when using this calendar, the millennium starts at x000 and ends at x999. There was a popular debate leading up to the [[Millennium celebrations|celebrations of the year 2000]] as to whether the beginning of that year should be understood (and celebrated) as the beginning of a new millennium. Historically, there has been debate around the turn of previous decades, centuries, and millennia.

The issue is tied to the convention of using [[ordinal number]]s to count millennia (as in "the third millennium"), as opposed to "the two thousands", which is unambiguous as it does not depend on which year counting starts. The first convention is common in English speaking countries, but the latter is favored in for example Sweden (''tvåtusentalet'', which translates literally as the ''two thousands period'').

===Viewpoint 1: X001–Y000===
Those holding that the arrival of the new millennium should be celebrated in the transition from 2000 to 2001 (i.e., December 31, 2000 to January 1, 2001), argued that because the Gregorian calendar has no year zero, the millennia should be counted from 1 AD. Thus the first period of one thousand complete years runs from the beginning of 1 AD to the end of 1000 AD, and the beginning of the second millennium took place at the beginning of 1001.

[[Arthur C. Clarke]] gave this [[analogy]] (from a statement received by [[Reuters]]): "If the scale on your grocer's weighing machine began at 1 instead of 0, would you be happy when he claimed he'd sold you 10 kg of tea?" This statement illustrates the common confusion about the calendar.

If one counts from the beginning of AD 1 to the ending of AD 1000, one would have counted 1000&amp;nbsp;years. The next 1000&amp;nbsp;years (millennium) would begin on the first day of 1001. So the calendar has not 'cheated' anyone out of a year. Clarke made reference to this viewpoint in his book ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'' referring to the Millennium Celebrations on December 31, 2000. In other words, the argument is based on the fact that the last year of the first two thousand years in the Gregorian calendar was 2000, not 1999.

===Viewpoint 2: X000–X999===
The "year 2000" has also been a popular phrase referring to an often [[utopia]]n future, or a year when stories in such a future were set, adding to its cultural significance. There was also media and public interest in the [[Y2K bug]]. People liked to compared their [[Odometer|odometer]] as a reason to celebrate the new millennium which goes from 1999 to 2000. Thus, the populist argument was that the new millennium should begin when the zeroes "rolled over" to 2000, i.e., the day after December 31, 1999. People&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/newmill.htm "When Does the New Millennium Begin?"] January 1, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; felt that the change of the hundreds digit in the year number, and the zeros rolling over, created a sense that a new century had begun.

This is similar to the common demarcation of decades by their most significant digits, e.g., naming the period 1980 to 1989 as the 1980s or "the eighties". Similarly, it would be valid to celebrate the year 2000 as a cultural event in its own right, and name the period 2000 to 2999 would be "the 2000s". In other words, the time period between 1 and 999 (999 years only) would be called the "0s" and the period between 1000 and 1999 would be the "1000s".

===Popular approach===
The popular&lt;ref name=AP&gt;Associated Press, [http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/01/news/mn-7177 "Y2K It Wasn't, but It Was a Party"], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; approach was to treat the end of 1999 as the end of a millennium and to hold millennium celebrations at midnight between December 31, 1999 and January 1, 2000, as per viewpoint 2. The cultural and psychological significance of the events listed above combined to cause celebrations to be observed one year earlier than the formal Gregorian date.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; This does not establish that insistence on the formal Gregorian date is "incorrect", though some view it as pedantic.

Some event organisers hedged their bets by calling their 1999 celebrations things like "Click" referring to the [[odometer]]-like rolling over of the nines to zeros. A second approach was to adopt two different views on the millennium problem and celebrate the new millennium twice.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]], in his essay ''Dousing Diminutive Dennis' Debate (or DDDD = 2000)'' (''[[Dinosaur in a Haystack]]''), discussed the "high" versus "pop" culture interpretation of the transition. Gould noted that the high culture, strict construction had been the dominant viewpoint at the 20th century's beginning, but that the pop culture viewpoint dominated at its end. Gould also included comments on adjustments to the calendar, such as those by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] (the eponymous "Diminutive Dennis") and the timing of celebrations over different transitional periods. Further of his essays on this topic are collected in ''Questioning the Millennium: A Rationalist's Guide to a Precisely Arbitrary Countdown''.

It is able to be measured using [[electromyography]] (EMG) from the contractions that occur. The general mechanism of it is still widely unknown. It is believed to be important in joint stabilization, as well as general [[motor control]].&lt;ref name=Le2017rev/&gt;

[[Image:EMGCOACTIVATION.JPG|thumb|Coactivation of [[biceps]] and [[triceps]]. The biceps’ EMG is on top, while the triceps’ EMG is on the bottom.]]

== Function ==
Muscle coactivation allows muscle groups surrounding a joint to become more stable. This is due to both muscles (or sets of muscles) contracting at the same time, which produces compression on the joint. The joint is able to become stiffer and more stable due to this action.&lt;ref name=Riemann2002rev&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riemann|first=Bryan L.|last2=Lephart|first2=Scott M.|date=2002-01-01|title=The Sensorimotor System, Part II: The Role of Proprioception in Motor Control and Functional Joint Stability|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|volume=37|issue=1|pages=80–84|issn=1062-6050|pmc=164312|pmid=16558671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LongstaffBook2005&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ezI2xyVwmgsC&amp;pg=PA234|title=BIOS Instant Notes in Neuroscience|last=Longstaff|first=Alan|date=2005-01-01|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=041535188X|language=en|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when the bicep and the triceps coactivate, the elbow becomes more stable. This stabilization mechanism is also important for unexpected loads impeded on the joint, allowing the muscles to coactivate and provide stability to the joint in a quick fashion.&lt;ref name=Le2017rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Riemann2002rev/&gt; This mechanism is controlled [[Neuromuscular junction|neuromuscularly]], which allows the muscle(s) to contract.&lt;ref name=Le2017rev /&gt; This occurs through a [[motor neuron]] sending a signal (through creating [[action potential]]s) to the [[Myocyte|muscle fiber]] to contract by releasing [[Acetylcholine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5YXRAAACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9780878936953&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwismv6h2MPTAhXqhFQKHbafBmkQ6AEIJzAA|title=Neuroscience|last=Purves|first=Dale|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Sinauer Associates|isbn=9780878936953|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When signals are sent to all muscle fibers in a muscle group, the muscle group will contract as a whole.

In the upper limbs, the stability of muscle coactivation allows for precise low-level physical tasks.&lt;ref name=Le2017rev/&gt;  An example of this would be picking up a small object. By protecting the muscles at the end of their range of motion, the direction of the fine movements is able to be changed.&lt;ref name=Riemann2002rev/&gt; In the lower limbs, stability is important in upright standing balance. The coactivation of different muscle groups allows for proper balance and the ability to adjust weight and to stay upright on uneven ground.&lt;ref name=RehabBook2013&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_eVOAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190|title=Neuroscience - E-Book: Fundamentals for Rehabilitation|last=Lundy-Ekman|first=Laurie|date=2013-08-07|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=|isbn=9780323266482|edition=4th|pages=190–220|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed to be important for [https://starfishtherapies.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/postural-control-how-the-systems-work-together/ postural control] by stabilizing the spine.&lt;ref name=Le2017rev/&gt; Muscle coactivation is absolutely necessary for learning a fine motor skill or for any activity involving stability.&lt;ref name=RehabBook2013/&gt; In order for muscle coactivation to occur, it must inhibit [[reciprocal innervation]], which occurs when a muscle contracts and the synergist muscle relaxes.&lt;ref name=LongstaffBook2005/&gt; For muscle coactivation to occur, both the muscle and synergist muscle need to contract.

== Testing ==
Muscle coactivation is measured using a technique called [[electromyography]](EMG).&lt;ref name=Le2017rev/&gt; This is performed by using surface EMG that responds to electrical activity of the muscle through the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dotan|first=Raffy|last2=Mitchell|first2=Cameron|last3=Cohen|first3=Rotem|last4=Klentrou|first4=Panagiota|last5=Gabriel|first5=David|last6=Falk|first6=Bareket|date=2017-04-27|title=Child—Adult Differences in Muscle Activation — A Review|journal=Pediatric exercise science|volume=24|issue=1|pages=2–21|issn=0899-8493|pmc=3804466|pmid=22433260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical activity is only present in the muscle when the muscle voluntarily contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klass|first=Malgorzata|last2=Baudry|first2=Stéphane|last3=Duchateau|first3=Jacques|date=2007-07-01|title=Voluntary activation during maximal contraction with advancing age: a brief review|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|language=en|volume=100|issue=5|pages=543–551|doi=10.1007/s00421-006-0205-x|pmid=16763836}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the muscle is contracted, the EMG is able to display the force of the contraction or how the nerves can respond to stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/neurological/electromyography_emg_92,P07656|title=Before, During and After Your EMG Test|website=www.hopkinsmedicine.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; An EMG of coactivation would display the agonist and antagonist muscle contracting simultaneously. Although it is believed many muscles are involved in the mechanism of coactivation, methods to measure coactivation are finite to specific instances or two muscle systems.

They have the potential for [[superplastic deformation]].&lt;ref name="Averback 1992" /&gt; Because of the small grain size and added grain boundaries properties such as ductility, hardness, and reactivity see drastic changes from ceramics with larger grains.

==Structure of Nanophase Ceramics==
The structure of nanophase ceramics is not too different than that of [[ceramic]]s.  The main difference is the amount of surface area per mass.  Particles of [[ceramic]]s have small surface areas, but when those particles are shrunk to within a few nanometers, the surface area of the same amount of a mass of a [[ceramic]] greatly increases.&lt;ref name="Nanoscale"&gt;[http://www.nano.gov/nanotech-101/special "What's So Special about the Nanoscale?"]. nano.gov. Retrieved December 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  So in general, nanophase materials have greater surface areas than that of a similar mass material at a larger scale.&lt;ref name="Nanoscale" /&gt;  This is important because if the surface area is very large the particles can be in contact with more of their surroundings, which in turn increases the reactivity of the material.&lt;ref name="Nanoscale" /&gt;  The reactivity of a material changes the material's [[mechanical properties]] and [[chemical properties]], among many other things.&lt;ref name="Nanoscale" /&gt;  This is especially true in nanophase ceramics.

==Properties of Nanophase Ceramics==
Nanophase ceramics have unique properties than regular [[ceramic]]s due to their improved reactivity.&lt;ref name="Nanoscale" /&gt;  Nanophase ceramics exhibit different mechanical properties than their counterpart such as higher [[hardness]], higher [[fracture toughness]], and high [[ductility]].&lt;ref name="Szlufarska"&gt;Szlufarska, Izabela, Nakano, Aiichiro, Vashista, Priya.(August 5, 2005). [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/309/5736/911.full "A Crossover in the Mechanical Response of Nanocrystalline Ceramics"] sciencemag.com. Volume 309 pgs. 911-913. Accessed December 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  These properties are far from [[ceramic]]s which behave as brittle, low ductile materials.

===Titanium Dioxide===
[[File:Strain Rate Sensitivity-page0001.jpg|thumb|Strain rate sensitivity for {{chem|TiO|2}}.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;]][[File:Microhardness of titaniumdioxide-page0001.jpg|thumb|Microhardness of {{chem|TiO|2}}.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;]]
[[Titanium dioxide]] ({{chem|TiO|2}}), has been shown to have increased hardness and ductility at the nanoscale.  In an experiment, grains of [[titanium dioxide]] that had an average size of 12 nanometers were compressed at 1.4 GPa and [[sintered]] at 200&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Siegel"&gt;Siegel, R.W.. [http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.ms.21.080191.003015 "Cluster-Assembled Nanophase Materials"]. ''Annual Review of Materials Science'' (1991) Volume 21, pgs. 559-577.&lt;/ref&gt;   The result was a grain hardness of about 2.2 times greater than that of grains of [[titanium dioxide]] with an average size of 1.3 micrometers at the same temperature and pressure.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;  In the same experiment, the [[ductility]] of [[titanium dioxide]] was measured.  The [[strain rate]] sensitivity of a 250 nanometer grain of [[titanium dioxide]] was about 0.0175, while a grain with size of about 20 nanometers had a [[strain rate]] sensitivity of approximately .037; a significant increase.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;

==Processing of Nanophase Ceramics==
Nanophase ceramics can be processed from atomic, molecular, or bulk precursors.&lt;ref name="Richard" /&gt;  Gas condensation, [[chemical precipitation]], aerosol reactions, biological templating, [[chemical vapor deposition]], and [[physical vapor deposition]] are techniques used to synthesis nanophase ceramics from molecular or atomic precursors.&lt;ref name="Richard"&gt;Siegel, Richard W.. [http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/79912 "SYNTHESIS, PROPERTIES, AND APPLICATIONS OF NANOPHASE MATERIALS"]. April 1995. Accessed December 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  To process nanophase ceramics from bulk precursors, mechanical attrition, [[crystallization]] from the [[amorphous state]], and phase separation are used to create nanophase ceramics.&lt;ref name="Richard" /&gt;  Synthesizing nanophase ceramics from atomic or molecular precursors are desired more because a greater control over microscopic aspects of the nanophase ceramic can occur.&lt;ref name="Richard" /&gt;

===Gas Condensation===
[[File:Gas condensation-page0001.jpg|thumb|Synthesis of nanophase ceramics using gas condensation.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;]]Gas condensation is one way nanophase ceramics are produced.  First, precursor ceramics are evaporated from sources within a gas-condensation chamber.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;  Then the ceramics are condensed in a gas (dependent on the material being synthesized) and transported via [[convection]] to a liquid-nitrogen filled cold finger.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;  Next, the ceramic powders are scraped off the cold finger and collect in a funnel below the cold finger.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;  The ceramic powders then become consolidated in a low-pressure compaction device and then in a high-pressure compaction device.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;  This all occurs in a vacuum, so no impurities can enter the chamber and affect the results of the nanophase ceramics.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt;

==Applications==
Nanophase ceramics have unique properties that make them optimal for a variety of applications.

===Drug Delivery===
Materials used in drug delivery in the past ten years have primarily been [[polymers]]. However, nanotechnology has opened the door for the use of [[ceramic]]s with benefits not previously seen in [[polymers]]. The large surface area to volume ratio of nanophase materials makes it possible for large amounts of drugs to be released over long periods of time. Nanoparticles to be filled with drugs can be easily manipulated in size and composition to allow for increased [[endocytosis]] of drugs into targeted cells and increased dispersion through fenestrations in capillaries. While these benefits all relate to nanoparticles in general (including [[polymers]]), ceramics have other, unique abilities. Unlike [[polymer]]s, slow degradation of ceramics allows for longer release of the drug. [[Polymers]] also tend to swell in liquid which can cause an unwanted burst of drugs. The lack of swelling shown by most ceramics allows for increased control. Ceramics can also be created to match the chemistry of biological cells in the body increasing bioactivity and biocompatibility. Nanophase ceramic drug carriers are also able to target specific cells. This can be done by manufacturing a material to bond to the specific cell or by applying an external magnetic field, attracting the carrier to a specific location.

===Bone Substitution===
Nanophase ceramics have great potential for use in [[orthopedic medicine]]. Bone and [[collagen]] have structures on the nanoscale. Nanomaterials can be manufactured to simulate these structures which is necessary for grafts and implants to successfully adapt to and handle varying stresses. The surface properties of nanophase ceramics is also very important for bone substitution and regeneration. Nanophase ceramics have much rougher surfaces than larger materials and also have increased surface area. This promotes reactivity and absorption of proteins that assist tissue development. Nano-hydroxyapatite is one nanophase ceramic that is used as a bone substitute. Nano grain size increases the bonding, growth, and differentiation of [[osteoblasts]] onto the ceramic. The surfaces of nanophase ceramics can also be modified to be porous allowing [[osteoblasts]] to create bone within the structure. The degradation of the ceramic is also important because the rate can be changed by changing the crystallinity. This way as bone grows the substitute can diminish at a similar rate.

==Campus==

===Bogota Branch===
The [[University City of Bogotá]] ({{lang-es|Ciudad Universitaria de Bogotá}}), also known as the White City ({{lang-es|Ciudad Blanca}}), is the flagship University campus.  It is located in the [[Teusaquillo]] locality, northwest of the historical center.  It is also the largest campus in Colombia, with an extension of {{convert|1200000|m2|acre|abbr=on}} and a constructed area of {{convert|308541|m2|acre|abbr=on}}, making it an ample campus with several green areas, open spaces, and pedestrian paths.  Among its buildings there are 17 which have been declared national monuments and, as a whole, it is a representation of the last 60 years of [[architecture]] in Colombia.

[[Image:PlazaCheoSantanderUNAL.JPG|thumb|right|Central square, Bogota's campus]]The campus was designed by German educationalist [[Fritz Karsen]] and architect [[Leopold Rother]], both refugees from Nazi Germany. The construction began in 1935, under the government of [[Alfonso López Pumarejo]]. It is organized as an ellipse, divided into five parts, each containing one of the academic divisions and its respective dependencies. From an aerial view, a shape of an owl can be seen, emblematic of a deep connection with wisdom and intuitive knowledge. The buildings were constructed as prismatic blocks, and painted white, in order to give an austere and clean look.

Some landmarks in the campus are the [[León de Greiff]] Auditorium, and the ''Francisco de Paula Santander'' Plaza, also known unofficially as the "Central Plaza" or the "Ché Plaza", in honor of [[Che Guevara|Ernesto ''el Ché'' Guevara]].  The campus has its own [[Alfonso López Pumarejo Stadium|stadium]], where sometimes matches for the [[Colombian Professional Football]] are held.

===Medellín Branch===
{{Main|National University of Colombia at Medellín}}
The [[National University of Colombia at Medellín|National University of Colombia, Medellín]] has two campuses, the Central Campus and Campus Robledo, where 10,447 students study. This site provides approximately 29% of the seats for new students at National. Also this site has 555 faculty professors, of which 38% are doctors, 44% are master's, 8% were specialists and 10% are Professionals. This site offers 26 undergraduate and 73 graduate courses: 15 PhDs, 28 Masters, and 29 specializations. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Its history has given Medellín a peculiar character, since it was formed as most of their universities from the classical degrees of [[Law]], [[Medicine]], [[Arts]] and [[Sciences]]. The site grew out of engineering programs, which is why today, the Medellín has the highest number of engineering programs (17) among the campuses of the National University of Colombia and Colombia in general. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Central Campus: Located northwest of downtown, between Cerro Ecoparque the Flyer and the Medellín River. It is since 1938 the headquarters of the National University of Colombia in Medellin when the School of Tropical Agriculture (now the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences) joined the University. The Central Campus has an area of 272,982 m², the heart of Rio has an area of 31,758 m² and a portion of Cerro El Flying is around 269,257 m². Several learning centers can be found in at the campus including the Entomological Museum which was founded in 1937, the Museum of Mycology founded in 1987, the Herbarium "Gabriel Gutierrez," the wood collection, the Central Library "Efe Gomez" as an attractive artistic and architectural highlights, the Totem Mythic created by Master Pedro Nel Gomez, Block 41 declared a National Cultural, designed by Engineer Jesús Montoya Mejía which began in 1931, the Block 11 Master designed by Pedro Nel Gómez. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Campus Robledo Robledo, also called core or more colloquially as the School of Mines, is located northwest of the city of Medellin, Robledo neighborhood is composed of three fields separated by Kr 80, which presents a difficult high traffic pedestrian connection between the properties that make up the physical structure of the School of Mines, and Ingeominas, recently integrated into the University. It has an area of 100,978.69 m². In 1886, the School of Mines was created and it was incorporated with the University in 1936, which is called today as the National School of Mines with approximately 3,500 students. It highlights the Museum of Geosciences, Maximum classroom buildings (block M5) and M3 block designed by Master Pedro Nel Gomez School of Mines in 1936. Declared National Monument in 1994 thanks to its architecture and its murals by the same Pedro Nel Gómez. The University in Medellin has 5 faculties of the schools offer 25 careers, nearly half of them are engineering at the School of Mines, also has three museums and other services. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

'''OpenViBE''' is a [[software platform]] dedicated to designing, testing and using [[brain-computer interface]]s. The package includes a Designer tool to create and run custom applications, along with several pre-configured and demo programs which are ready for use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ercim-news.ercim.eu/en78/rd/openvibe-open-source-software-for-brain-computer-interfaces OpenViBE: Open-Source Software for Brain-Computer Interfaces] ERCIM News, accessed March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenViBE is software for [[Real-time computing|real-time]] [[neuroscience]] (that is, for real-time processing of [[Electroencephalography|brain signals]]). It can be used to acquire, filter, process, classify and visualize brain signals in real time.

==Applications==
The main OpenViBE application fields are medical (assistance to disabled people, real-time [[biofeedback]], [[neurofeedback]], real-time [[diagnosis]]), [[multimedia]] ([[virtual reality]], [[video game]]s), [[robotics]] and all other application fields related to brain-computer interfaces and real-time [[neuroscience]]s.

OpenViBE users can either be [[programmer]]s or people not familiar with programming. This includes [[medical doctor]]s, [[video game developer]]s, researchers in [[signal processing]] or robotics, etc.

Since 2012, the start-up Mensia Technologies has developed an advanced version of the software called NeuroRT Suite.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mensiatech.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interface==
The [[user interface]] of OpenVibe is easy to use for creating BCI scenarios and saving them for later use, to access and to manipulate.
OpenVibe is the first [[Library (computing)|library of functions]] written in [[C++]] of this type developed by [[INRIA]] - Institut national de recherche en informatique et automatique (France) - it can be integrated and applied quickly and easily .

'''Paleopedology''' ('''palaeopedology''' in the [[United Kingdom]]) is the discipline that studies [[soil]]s of past geological eras, from quite recent ([[Quaternary]]) to the earliest periods of the [[Earth]]'s history. Paleopedology can be seen either as a branch of [[soil science]] ([[Pedology (soil study)|pedology]]&lt;!--link to disambig is intentional--&gt;) or of [[paleontology]], since the methods it uses are in many ways a well-defined combination of the two disciplines.

==History==
Paleopedology's earliest developments arose from observations in [[Scotland]] circa 1795 whereby it was found that some soils in cliffs appeared to be remains of a former exposed land surface. During the nineteenth century there were many other finds of former soils throughout [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. However, most of this was only found in the search for [[animal]] and/or [[plant]] fossils and it was not until soil science first developed that buried soils of past geological ages were considered of any value.

It was only when the first relationships between soils and [[climate]] were observed in the [[steppe]]s of [[Russia]] and [[Kazakhstan]] that there was any interest in applying the finds of former soils to past ecosystems. This occurred because, by the 1920s, some soils in Russia had been found by [[Konstantin Glinka|K.D. Glinka]] that did not fit with present climates and were seen as relics of warmer climates in the past.

[[Eugene W. Hilgard]], in 1892, had related soil and climate in the [[United States]] in the same manner, and by the 1950s analysis of Quaternary stratigraphy to monitor recent environmental changes in the northern hemisphere had become firmly established. These developments have allowed soil fossils to be classified according to [[USDA soil taxonomy]] quite easily with all recent soils. Interest in earlier soil fossils was much slower to grow, but has steadily developed since the 1960s owing to the development of such techniques as [[X-ray diffraction]] which permit their classification. This has allowed many developments in [[paleoecology]] and [[paleogeography]] to take place because the soils' chemistry can provide a good deal of evidence as to how life moved onto land during the [[Paleozoic|Paleozoic era]].

==Finding soil fossils and their structure==
Remains of former soils can either be found under deposited [[sediment]] in unglaciated areas or in extremely steep cliffs where the old soil can be seen below the young present-day soil. In cases where [[volcano]]es have been active, some soil fossils occur under the volcanic ash. If there is continued deposition of sediment, a sequence of soil fossils will form, especially after the retreat of [[glacier]]s during the [[Holocene]]. Soil fossils can also exist where a younger soil has been eroded (for instance by wind), as in the Badlands of [[South Dakota]]. (One must ''exclude'' areas where present-day soils are relics of former wetter climates, as with [[Australia]] and [[Southern Africa]]. The soils of these regions are proper ''[[paleosols]]''.)

Soil fossils, whether buried or exposed, suffer from alteration. This occurs largely because almost all past soils have lost their former vegetative covering and the organic matter they once supported has been used up by plants since the soil was buried. However, if remains of plants can be found, the nature of the soil fossil can be made a great deal clearer than if no flora can be found because roots can nowadays be identified with respect to the [[plant]] group from which they come. Patterns of ''root traces'' including their shape and size, is good evidence for the vegetation type the former soil supported. Bluish colours in the soil tend to indicate the plants have mobilized nutrients within the soil.

The horizons of fossil soils typically are sharply defined only in the top layers, unless some of the parent material has not been obliterated by soil formation. The kinds of horizons in fossil soils are, though, generally the same as those found in present-day soils, allowing easy classification in modern taxonomy of all but the oldest soils.

==Analysis==
[[File:VertisolpaleosolWatervalOnder.jpg|thumb|Vertisol paleosol Watervol Onder.]]
[[File:MollisolDayvilleOregon.jpg|thumb|Mollisol in Dayville Oregon.]]
Chemical analysis of soil fossils generally focuses on their [[calcium carbonate|lime]] content, which determines both their pH and how reactive they will be to dilute [[acid]]s. Chemical analysis is also useful, usually through [[solvent extraction]] to determine key minerals. This analysis can be of some use in determining the structure of a soil fossil, but today X-ray diffraction is preferred because it permits the exact crystal structure of the former soil to be determined.

With the aid of X-ray diffraction, paleosols can now be classified into one of the 12 orders of Soil Taxonomy ([[Oxisols]], [[Ultisols]], [[Alfisols]], [[Mollisols]], [[Spodosols]], [[Aridisols]], [[Entisols]], [[Inceptisols]], [[Gelisols]], [[Histosols]], [[Vertisols]] and [[Andisols]]). Many [[Precambrian]] soils, however, when examined do not fit the characteristics for ''any'' of these soil orders and have been placed in a new order called '''green clays'''. The green colour is due to the presence of certain unoxidised minerals found in the primitive earth because [[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] was not present. There are also some forest soils of more recent times that cannot clearly be classified as Alfisols or as Spodosols because, despite their sandy horizons, they are not nearly acidic enough to have the typical features of a Spodosol.

==Importance==
Paleopedology is an important scientific discipline for the understanding of the ecology and evolution of ancient ecosystems, both on Earth and the emerging field of exoplanet research. [Section is currently under construction.]

'''Models'''

The different definitions applied to soils is indicative of the different approaches taken to them. Where farmers and engineers experience different soil challenges, soil scientists have a different view again (Johnson &amp; Watson-Stegner 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson, D. &amp; Watson-Stegner, D.|first=|date=|title=Evolution model of pedogenesis|url=|journal=Soil Science|volume=143|pages=349–366|via=|doi=10.1097/00010694-198705000-00005|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Essentially, these differing views of the definition of soil are different theoretical bases for their study (Retallack 2001&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Soils of the Past: An introduction to paleopedology (2nd edition)|last=Retallack|first=Gregory J.|publisher=Blackwell Science|year=2001|isbn=9780632053766|location=Malden, MA|pages=171–172, 180–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Soils can be thought of as open systems in that they represent a boundary between the earth and the atmosphere where materials are transported and are changed. There are four basic types of flux: additions, subtractions, transfers, and transformations (Simonson 1978;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A multiple-process model of soil genesis|last=Simonson|first=R.W.|publisher=Geoabstracts|year=1978|isbn=|location=Norwich|pages=1–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=D.W.|date=|title=The effect of parent material and soil development on nutrient cycling in temperate ecosystems|url=|journal=Biogeochemistry|volume=5|pages=71–97|via=|doi=10.1007/bf02180318|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Examples of addition can include mineral grains and leaf litter, while subtractions can include surficial erosion of minerals and of organic matter. Transfers include the movement of a material within soil profile, and transformations are the change of composition and form of the materials within a soil.

Soils can also be considered to be energy transformers in that they are physical structures of material that are modified by naturally occurring processes. The sun constitutes the primary energy source for soils, and significantly outweighs any heat generated by radioactive decay flowing up from deep within the Earth's crust. The deposition of sediment, or the addition of groundwater or rain, can also be considered an energy gain because new minerals and water can alter preexisting materials within the soil. These processes, coupled with the amount of energy available to fuel them, are what create a soil profile.

Another way to view soils is that they are environmental products that are molded over a period of time from the materials available to them. The large amount of influences that effect the formation of soils can be simplified to five main factors: climate, organisms, topographic relief, parent material, and time (Jenny 1941;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Factors in Soil Formation|last=Jenny|first=H.J.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1941|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buol et al. 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Soil Genesis and Classification (4th edition)|last=Buol|first=S.W.|publisher=Iowa State University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Ames|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). These five factors can be easily remembered using the acronym 'CLORPT'. These categories are useful for mentally considering that aspects that occurred during the formation of a soil or paleosol. More importantly however, CLORPT allows for a theoretical framework when creating natural experiments for the study of soil formation. (Retallack 2001&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;)

'''Climate'''

When soil science was first founded, [[climate]] was considered one of the most important factors regarding the formation of soil. For instance, temperate regions have widespread acidic sand Spodosols, and in tropical regions red clayey Oxisols are common. The tendency to use climatic data for the classification of soils has been challenged by efforts to base the classification of soil on observable features within the soils. This tendency is unfortunate because paleoclimates cannot be interpreted from paleosols identified using paleoclimatic data. Fortunately, the identification of paleosols using climatic data is changing. For example, Aridisols have been redefined (Soil Survey Staff 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Keys to Soil Taxonomy|last=Soil Survey Staff|first=|publisher=Pocahontas Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=Blacksburg, VA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as soils that possess a calcic horizon of less than 1 meter in depth.

The terms climate and [[weather]] are sometimes used interchangeably in modern languages, but have very different scientific meanings. Weather is the record of temperature, rainfall, and humidity as reported daily online, by newspapers, and by television. Conversely, climate is the average of data collected from weather reports, usually over a 30-year period, that reflects these observations. The weather data used to determine climate is based on particular weather stations that are generally chosen to reflect the conditions that exist in the surrounding region (Müller 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Selected Climatic Data for a Global Set of Standard Stations for Vegetation Science|last=Muller|first=M.J.|publisher=Junk, The Hague|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, exposed high ridges and local frost hollows are not considered regarding regional weather stations because they represent microclimates and are significantly different from regional climate even though they are important for small flora and fauna.

Like exposed high ridges and local frost hollow microclimates, soil climate is also a special kind of microclimate. It refers to the moisture, temperature, and other climatic indicators that are found within the pores of soil. For example, in well-drained soils, the soil climate is a somewhat subdued version of the regional climate. In waterlogged soils, soil climate is not related to regional climate because the temperature and oxygenation of waterlogged soils is more dependent on local groundwater paths and rates than on atmospheric conditions. Estimates of other types of soil climate are now beginning to find their way into the classification of soils, the models for soil formation, and into the study of soil biology.

The classification of climate from paleosols can be related using climatically sensitive features of soils that are sensitive to particular climatic variables, but even the best of these features lack precision. This is because soils are not as sensitive as meteorological instruments for recording climatic conditions. However, in a fairly broad category, climate can be interpreted from the sensitive features found in soils. One of the most large-scale influences regarding the classification of climate was created in 1918, then modified over two decades by the German meteorologist [[Wladimir Köppen|Vladimir Köppen]] (Trewartha 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Earth's Problem Climates|last=Trewartha|first=G.T.|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1982|isbn=|location=Madison, WI|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). He proposed there are five main climate groups ([[Köppen climate classification]]), each corresponding to the main types of terrestrial vegetation. Each climate type is designated by letters, with upper-case letters referring to the main climate groups and lower-case letters referring to subsidiary climatic features. (Retallack 2001&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;)

'''Organisms'''
[[File:beenestwyoming.jpg|thumb|alt=.|Bee nest ichnofossils of Wyoming.]]
Large plants are only part of the organisms that play a role in soil formation. For example, [[Fungus|fungi]] are closely associated with the roots of many [[vascular plants]] by making available nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus in a way that their host plants can utilize, and play an important role in returning organic matter to the soil by decomposing leaf litter. The list of organisms that interact with, and affect, soil is extensive, and it is these interactions that allow for the presence of paleosols to be inferred. Not only can particular organisms be interpreted from paleosols, but also ancient ecosystems. The soil interaction of plants is different from community to community. They each have distinct patterns of root traces, soil structure, and overall profile form. Identifying these features is useful for providing an overall assessment of the influence past organisms had on any particular paleosol. However, qualifying these general effects of organism activity can be difficult because the level of their expression is as related to their nature as it is to the amount of time available for soil formation. Even when [[fossil]]s that are found in paleosols are understood, much more can be learned regarding their preservation, ecology, and evolution by studying the paleosols they inhabited.           
[[File:fossilstumpsinpaleosol.jpg|thumb|alt=.|Fossil stumps in a paleosol.]] 
A fossilized footprint, [[burrow]], or [[coprolite]] (fossil feces), are examples of trace fossils [[Trace fossil|(ichnofossils]]). These trace fossils do not represent any physical part of an organism, but rather evidence of an organism's activity within its environment. Whereas a bone, leaf, or stem might provide enough information to positively identify a particular species, trace fossils rarely allow for such a precise identification. However, unlike fossilized body parts which can be affected by many variables, trace fossils are not often transported away and are usually found in the place where the organism lived. This advantage makes trace fossils in paleosols especially important because they allow for interpretation of the animal's behavior in its natural environment. A great example of this is the simple shallow fossilized burrows of solitary bees that make their homes in soil.          
Just as fossilized footprints, burrows, and coprolites represent trace fossils or organisms, paleosols can be considered trace fossils of an ancient ecosystem. Much like the small percentage of species that are fossilized, very few species within an ecosystem leave any discernible trace in paleosols. However, their more general effects within a paleosol may be preserved. A good example of this is root traces. Analyzing the pattern of root traces, the sequence of soil horizons, and other features can help identify the type of vegetation that was present during the formation of the soil. General features such as stature and spacing determine what botanists call a 'plant formation.' Distinct from a community or association, plant formation is not defined by any particular species. Examples of plant formation include forests, woodlands, and grasslands. Because it may not be possible to determine whether a particular plant was an oak, eucalyptus, or other species, plant formations in paleosols make it possible to identify an ancient woodland ecosystem from an ancient grassland ecosystem. (Retallack 2001&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;)

'''Topographic Relief'''

The nature of soils will vary with [[topography]], which can be understood by comparing the thin rocky soils of mountain tops to the thick fertile soils of grass-covered lowlands. Even in a featureless lowland, the nature of a soil will vary greatly depending on whether or not it is well drained; although the drainage of soil is not completely independent because vegetation, microclimate, and the age of the land surfaces will vary within a given landscape. However, in smaller areas, the limiting factors may be so extensive that a variation in soils across a landscape will constitute a true toposequence (topographical sequence), and the features within these soils can yield reliable topofunctions (topographic functions). Bold landscapes like alpine ridges and peaks can be resolved based on distinct slope-related processes. For example, steep alpine slopes have sparse vegetation with soils that are eroded by snow melt, agitated by [[Frost heaving|frost heave]], and impacted by rock fall. These processes create thin, shallowly rooted, lightly weathered and rocky soils that are indicative of a mountain slope environment. The size and degree of these processes do not allow for strict analysis as topofunctions because of the extensive variation in climate, vegetation, parent materials, and land surface age at different elevations on a mountainside. (Retallack 2001&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;)

'''Parent Material'''

The rock or sediment associated with a soil's development is referred to as its [[parent material]]; it's the starting point for the process of soil formation. During early formation, soils are not so different from their parent materials. With time however, soils will contain less and less features of their original parent material, until eventually taking on an identity all of their own. In order to make an accurate assessment of the amount of soil formation that has occurred, the parent material must be known to establish a base line, or starting point in the soil's formation.                                          
[[File:parentmaterialigneous.tif|thumb|left|alt=.|Igneous parent material.]]
In most instances, parent material is independent of soil formation. The formation of [[igneous rock]]s and [[metamorphic rock]]s occur in locations and by processes removed from the surface of the Earth. These [[sediment]]s are often the parent material for soils and are derived from soils, but the degree of sedimentary sorting and distribution varies so widely that these are also considered to be independent of soils.                                                                                        
[[File:parentmaterialsedimentary.tif|thumb|alt=.|Sedimentary parent material.]]
Very few parent materials associated with soils are entirely uniform in their composition or structure. Frequently, there is some degree of irregularity including foliation, veining, jointing, or layering that in some cases helps with soil formation, and in other cases hampers it. For example, some sedimentary layering promotes the formation of soil such as a [[silt]]y cover on bedrock, or a sandy cover on a clayey [[alluvium]] layer. In both of these cases, a [[Friability|friable]] surface material has been established by nonpedogenic instances. Other instances of sedimentary surface cementation, or fine interbedded sequences of clay and sand, could be considered to be not conducive to the formation of a soil. Nonuniform parent materials may be difficult to find in soils and paleosols, although deviations from normally found minerals could lend clues to the original parent material. If grains of primary materials are not found in the parent material, it can be inferred that later additions occurred. For example, [[quartz]] is not found in [[basalt]]ic [[phonolite]], and [[olivine]] is not found in [[granite]].

The role of parent material is best understood from studies of soils that formed under similar conditions on different parent materials or lithosequences (differing soil profile characteristics because of differing parent materials). This provides a starting point for understanding what role the parent material played during the formation of the soil. The generalized relationships obtained from these studies can be used to determine what effects the parent material had on the paleosol during its formation. The difficulty lies with the fact that the parent material no longer exists, and therefore its nature can only be estimated using nearby materials.

These estimates are typically based on four critical assumptions that should be recognized as assumptions, and thus assessed cautiously when evaluating soils and paleosols.                                                                                               
# The first assumption is that the parent material is fresh. This means that the parent material assumed to be a proxy for the original parent material must be both chemically and physically similar to that original material. For example, [[saprolite]] cannot be considered to be an accurate representation of a parent material derived from a forested soil on granite, but could be considered to represent a parent material of a cultivated soil formed after a [[Clearcutting|clear-cut]] and [[erosion]] of a forested soil.                                                                                               
# The second assumption is that the parent material was uniform. This assumption states that the parent material had a uniform composition within the soil profile. If the properties of the material found below the profile are to be considered representative of the parent material of the entire profile, this must be true. However, this is difficult considering that few rocks or sediments are uniform enough to be considered an accurate representation of the original parent material. For example, it is extremely difficult to detect a thin layer of windblown dust on top of granite within a thick clayey soil.                                                                                               
# The third assumption is that one constituent is stable. This states that at least one of the constituents of the parent material is unaltered by weathering and is still present. The main problem with this is that no constituents are fully immune to the breadth weathering processes that exist in nature (Gardner 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gardner|first=L.R.|date=|title=Mobilization of Al and Ti during weathering - isovolumetric chemical evidence|url=|journal=Chemical Geology|volume=30|pages=151–165|via=|doi=10.1016/0009-2541(80)90122-9|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;). For example, quartz is a fairly stable mineral in soils with pH&gt;9, where [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]] (Al{{sub|2}}O{{sub|3}}) is stable in between pH 4.5 and 8 (mostly in clay). Trace elements that are usually stable in soils over a wider range of environmental conditions include [[lead]] (Pb) and [[zirconium]] (Zr), but are not always sufficiently present to be useful.                                                                                               
# The fourth assumption is that volume change is proportional to thickness and density. This states that the loss of soil volume, and the degree of compaction during burial, are related to their density or thickness change. Although common sense suggests that volume and density are three dimensional, and thickness it one dimensional, observations on various materials, including fossil plants of known shape (Walton 1936;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walton|first=J.|date=|title=On the factors which influence the external form of fossil plants; with description of some species of the Paleozoic equisetalean genus Annularia Sternberg|url=|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|volume=Series B, 226|pages=219–237|via=|doi=10.1098/rstb.1936.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briggs and '''Williams 1981'''), show that while under conditions of static vertical load, soils and fossils are maintained by pressure at the side.                                                                                                 
These four simplifying assumptions allow for a detailed analysis of the changes that occur during the formation of a soil and the burial of a soil. (Retallack 2001&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;)

In [[geochemistry]], a knowledge of the structure of former soils is also valuable to understand the composition of paleo continents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2400">In the [[social science|social sciences]] and [[philosophy]], a '''positive''' or '''descriptive statement''' concerns what "is", "was", or "will be", and contains no indication of approval or disapproval (what should be). Positive statements are thus the opposite of [[normative statement|normative statements]]. Positive statement is based on empirical evidence. For examples, "An increase in taxation will result in less consumption" and "A fall in supply of petrol will lead to an increase in its price". However, positive statement can be factually incorrect: "The moon is made of green cheese" is empirically false, but is still a positive statement, as it is a statement about what is, not what should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Positive and normative economics|website=http://www.soas.ac.uk/cedep-demos/000_P570_IEEP_K3736-Demo/unit1/page_16.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positive statements and normative  statements ==
Positive statements are distinct from normative statements. Positive statements are based on empirical evidence, can be tested, and involve no value judgements. Positive statements refer to '''what is''' and contain no indication of approval or disapproval. When values or opinions come into the analysis, then it is in the realm of normative economics. A '''normative''' statement expresses a judgment about whether a situation is desirable or undesirable, which can carry value judgements. These refer to '''what ought to be.'''

== Use of positive statement ==
Positive statements are widely used to describe something measurable, like the rate of  inflation in an economy. They are mainly used in explanations of theories and concepts. Using a positive statement does not mean you can't have your own opinions on issues. However, when you are writing academic essays it's important to use positive statements to support an argument, since it can be verified by evidence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10235">'''Post-conceptual''', '''Postconceptual''', '''Post-conceptualism''' or '''Postconceptualism''' is an [[art theory]] that builds upon the legacy of [[conceptual art]] in [[contemporary art]], where the [[concept]](s) or [[idea]](s) involved in the work takes some precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] and material concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Conceptual Art: Themes and movements'', Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The term first came into art school parlance through the influence of [[John Baldessari]] at the [[California Institute of the Arts]] in the early 1970s. The writer eldritch Priest, specifically ties John Baldessari's piece ''Throwing four balls in the air to get a square (best of 36 tries)'' from 1973 (in which the artist attempted to do just that, photographing the results, and eventually selecting the best out of 36 tries, with 36 being the determining number as that is the standard number of shots on a roll of [[35mm film]]) as an early example of post-conceptual art.&lt;ref&gt;eldritch Priest, ''Boring Formless Nonsense: Experimental Music and The Aesthetics of Failure'', Bloomsbury Academic, 2013, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It is now often connected to [[generative art]] and [[digital art]] production.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All : Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. pp. 125-131&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-conceptualism as an art practice has also been connected to the work of [[Robert C. Morgan]], specifically his ''Turkish Bath'' installation at [[Artists Space]] in 1976, and in Morgan's writing in ''Between Modernism and Conceptual Art: A Critical Response '' from 1997. It has been connected to the work of [[Robert Smithson]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All : Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. pp. 99-116&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mel Bochner]], [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], [[Yves Klein]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Alberro &amp; Sabeth Buchmann, eds., ''Art After Conceptual Art'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2006, pp. 89–93&lt;/ref&gt; [[Piero Manzoni]],&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Alexander Alberro &amp; Sabeth Buchmann, eds., ''Art After Conceptual Art'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2006, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manfred Mohr]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]],&lt;ref&gt;https://vimeo.com/3908524 "Interview with Joseph Nechvatal, post-conceptual digital artist, composer and art theoretician"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lygia Clark]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Alberro &amp; Sabeth Buchmann, eds., ''Art After Conceptual Art'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2006, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Ascott]], [[Allan McCollum]], [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]], [[Mary Kelly (artist)|Mary Kelly]], [[Annette Lemieux]],&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Matt Mullican]], and  the [[intermedia]] concept employed in the mid-sixties by [[Fluxus]] artist [[Dick Higgins]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All : Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==As specific condition==
Conceptual Art focused attention on the idea behind the art object and questioned the traditional role of that object as the conveyor of [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]. Subsequently, those theories cast doubt upon the necessity of materiality itself as conceptual artists "de-materialized" the art object and began to produce time-based and [[ephemeral]] artworks. Although total [[dematerialization (art)|dematerialization of the art object]] never occurred, the [[art object]] became flexible – [[malleable]] – and that malleability, coupled with [[semiotics]] and [[computer process]]ing, has resulted in the '''post-conceptual art object'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plasticpropaganda.co.uk/catalogues/Plastic_Propaganda_Post_Conceptual_Art_Practice_Part_Two.pdf] Post-Conceptual Art Practice: New Directions&lt;/ref&gt;

==As general condition==
Conceptual Art at the end of the 20th Century spread to become a general tendency, a resonance within art practice that became nearly ubiquitous. Thus the widespread use of the term “post-conceptual” as a prefix to painting such as that of [[Gerhard Richter]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://oro.open.ac.uk/21890/] Gaiger, Jason (2004). Post conceptual painting: Gerhard Richter's Extended Leave-taking in themes in contemporary art. In: Perry, Gillian and Wood, Paul eds. Themes in Contemporary Art. London: Yale University Press, pp. 89–135&lt;/ref&gt; and photography such as that of [[Andreas Gursky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-flux.com/journal/one-and-three-ideas-conceptualism-before-during-and-after-conceptual-art/|title=One and Three Ideas: Conceptualism Before, During, and After Conceptual Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh|Benjamin Buchloh]] in ''Art After Conceptual Art'' points out that post-conceptual art is already emerging in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the photo-based [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation art]] of [[Martha Rosler]], [[Louise Lawler]],  [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Peter Nagy (artist)|Peter Nagy]], [[Barbara Kruger]], [[Sherrie Levine]] and [[Dara Birnbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Alberro &amp; Sabeth Buchmann, eds., ''Art After Conceptual Art'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2006, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]] makes the point that "post-conceptual art is not the name for a particular type of art so much as the historical-[[ontological]] condition for the production of contemporary art in general...."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All : Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. pp. 3 &amp; 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Osborne first noted that [http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf contemporary art is 'post-conceptual] in a public lecture delivered at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Villa Sucota in [[Como]] on July 9, 2010. It is a claim made at the level of the [[ontology]] of the work of art (rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement).

'''Presumption of guilt''', in Latin, ''ei incumbit probatio qui negat, non qui dicit'' (the burden of proof is on the one who denies, not on one who declares), is the principle that one is considered guilty unless proven innocent. Generally, this is an [[argument from ignorance]], a philosophical concept in which a thing is assumed to be true because not proved false.

==In the law==

Presumption of guilt shifts the [[burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]] onto the defendant, who must then [[Burden of proof (philosophy)#Proving a negative|prove a negative]] to achieve [[acquittal]]. The phrase has been in use since at least the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;
T. C. Granger. ''A digest of the law of evidence in criminal cases'' W. Benning &amp; Company, 1846&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Default effect|default position]] based on pessimism and [[Suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]] whereas [[presumption of innocence]] is based more on optimism and [[Trust (emotion)|trust]]. There is a greater likelihood of obtaining a [[wrongful conviction]]. For example, in the [[murder of Lynette White]] case, a double wrong was committed in that innocent men were convicted, while the real perpetrator remained at large and a danger to the public.

Presumption of guilt is a denial of an international [[human right]] under the UN's [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Article 11. Under the presumption of guilt, the defence must collect and present compelling evidence to the [[trier of fact]] (a judge or a jury). The defence must, in most cases prove that the accused is innocent.

==Widespread prevalence==
Presumption of guilt is pandemic, occasionally erupting into epidemic proportions. Smaller instances include adverse accusatory reactions to unusual costume such as the [[burqa]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Angela Rainey]], 'Here's what happens when you wear a burka in Northern Ireland towns', The Belfast Telegraph, 7 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; or merely a 'suspicious stare' from the police.&lt;ref&gt;[[John P Crank]], ''Understanding Police Culture'', Routledge, p 146&lt;/ref&gt; More severe is the [[blame culture]] inherent in bureaucratic organisations where those with the least responsibility are blamed the most.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Belief in the '[[Stab-in-the-back myth]]' – that Jews and profiteers were collectively guilty of losing the war for Germany in 1918 – is an extreme instance of guilt being presumed.

==Typology==

Presumption of guilt may take many forms: 
* [[Guilt by association]], for example, punishing the families of North Korean defectors.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Laurence and Ju-Min Park, 'Guilty by association: growing up in hell of North Korean gulag', Reuters, may 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Extrajudicial punishment]] such as [[lynching]] or other forms of [[vigilantism]], which seek to bypass legal procedures;
* [[Blaming the victim]]; for example, victims of rape in Saudi Arabia and Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vicky Baker]], 'Rape victim sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in jail', The Guardian, 17 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Neela Debnath]], 'rape victims still blamed for sexual violence in Somalia', The Independent, 6 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Collective guilt]], for example the belief that 'all Muslims are terrorists';&lt;ref&gt;[[Spencer Case]], 'Islamist Terror and Collective Guilt', [[national Review]], 4 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; conversely, the terrorist may believe his victims to be collectively guilty of some perceived injustice, as in the case of [[9/11]]. A belief in [[Jewish deicide]] expresses the view that 'all Jews are Christ-killers',&lt;ref&gt;Peter J Tomson, ''Presumed Guilty: How the Jews were Blamed For the Death of Jesus'', Fortress Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; though in fact only the Romans had the legal authority to crucify someone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giles Fraser]], 'Christians must understand that for Jews the cross is a symbol of oppression', [[The Guardian]], 25 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rushing to [[judgement]], for example equating arrest with conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Luke Gittos]], '[[Eric Bellquist]] and the presumption of innocence', ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', 2017-08-17&lt;/ref&gt;
* The obtaining of a [[false confession]] under [[duress]] or [[torture]]; 
* [[Judicial misconduct]] such as [[collusion]] with the prosecution; [[judicial murder]]
* A [[frameup]], usually admissions presumably made, "false statements". All such admissions should be treated with skepticism without actual video or a signed statement.[[miscarriage of justice]]; 
* A [[plea bargain]], which in the worst case may induce a guilty party to give [[false testimony]] against an innocent co-accused;
* A [[fixed penalty notice]] or on-the-spot fine; 
* [[Precrime]] policies such as [[preventive detention]]
* Preemptive action such as [[drone strikes]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Robertson|title=Drone attacks go against every human rights principle in the book|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/lifestyle/2012/06/drone-attacks-against-human-rights-principle-book|work=New Statesman|date=13 June 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==

* [[Racial prejudice]];&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Stevenson, 'A presumption of guilt', [[The New York Review]], 13 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[authority fallacy]], demonstrated by the [[Milgram experiment]], in which persons may be too much inclined to follow orders from a perceived [[authoritarian]] figure; as in the extreme case of [[Hitler]], [[Adolf Eichmann]], and the [[Final solution]].
* Short-term political gain and the destruction of political rivals, as in the [[Stalinist]] [[show trials]] of the 1930s.
* Dissatisfaction or impatience with due [[legal process]] which [[vigilantes]] and others see as 'weak'.
* 'Impatience and fear of jurors, 'media frenzy', a punitive culture, and cognitive bias'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Findley]], 'The presumption of Innocence exists in theory, not reality', [[Washington Post]], 19/1/2016&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2018}}
* Psychological game-playing; the aggressive accuser is said to play [[mind games]], while the victim is on a [[guilt trip]]. Guilt feelings may be residual from early childhood, in which all of us are powerless and presumption of guilt ('you naughty boy', 'shame on you, wicked child') is often the norm.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wayne Dyer]], ''[[Your Erroneous Zones]]'', Warner Books, 1976, p 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Berne]], ''[[Games People Play (book)]]'', Penguin 1964, pp 73-75&lt;/ref&gt;
* A mind-set which favours [[Apocalypticism]]. According to [[Jonathan Schell]], the religiously orthodox may 'take it upon themselves to please a wrathful God' through the 'extinction of 'evil' mankind'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Schell]], ''[[The Fate of the Earth]]'', Picador, 1982, p133&lt;/ref&gt; Apocalypticism attracts 'desperate, humiliated and defeated' people, says [[John Michael Greer]]; it 'offers a free ticket out of the troubles of everyday life'.&lt;ref&gt;John Michael Greer, ''Apocalypse'', Quercus, 2012, pp 35, 36, 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Presumption of guilt is as old as [[Suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]] itself. In ancient Greece, public officials were elected for very limited terms of office and barred from re-election, on the presumption that too long an incumbency would lead to abuse of power. [[Thucydides]] and [[Aristophanes]]&lt;ref&gt;M S Silk, ''Aristophanes and the Definition of Comedy'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p 372&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the crowd were too easily swayed by [[Eloquence|oratory]]  and emotion. As [[Lord Acton]] wrote in the 19th century, again expressing presumption of guilt, "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men,..."&lt;ref name="lmcone"&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/165acton.html Letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton, April 5, 1887] published in ''Historical Essays and Studies'', edited by J. N. Figgis and R. V. Laurence (London: Macmillan, 1907)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Hitler]] was a persistent presumer of guilt in those he disliked. Being allegedly a [[psychopath]] and [[narcissist]]&lt;ref&gt;see Wikipedia article [[psychopathography of Adolf Hitler]]&lt;/ref&gt; he tended to blame others when things went wrong. From 1918 he blamed Germany's defeat on the [[November criminals]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] for negotiating a truce when Germany still had the capacity to fight on; in [[Mein Kampf]] he wrote; 'every third German is a traitor'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sebastian Haffner]], ''The Meaning of Hitler'', Phoenix 2003, p 154&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, when it was clear that Germany could not win the war, Hitler wished to punish the entire nation for failing to meet his expectations, according to [[Sebastian Haffner]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sebastian Haffner]], ''The Meaning of Hitler'', Phoenix 2003, p 120, 157, 160, 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1947 and 1956, many US citizens were unfairly accused of being communist agents or sympathisers and had their careers ruined during the era of [[McCarthyism]] and the [[Second Red Scare]], or even killed like [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]]. The McCarthyites 'never produced a single Communist spy whose guilt was proved in court.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Don E Carleton]] and [[John Henry Faulk]], ''Red Scare: Right-Wing Hysteria, Fifties Fanaticism, and Their Legacy in Texas'', University of Texas Press, 2014, p x&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], supreme leader of [[Iran]], pronounced a death sentence by [[fatwa]] on [[Salman Rushdie]] and anyone assisting publication of his book, ''[[The Satanic Verses]]''; 'I call on all Muslims wherever they may be in the world to kill them without delay'. the Fatwa was condemned for violating [[national sovereignty]], [[freedom of speech]], and the Muslim principle of [[fiqh]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Newsweek]], 27 February 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-incrimination ==
{{main|Self-incrimination}}
In the UK case ''Hale'', 2 P. C. 290 (n), the defendant was alleged to have murdered his niece, who had cried out 'good uncle do not kill me', and then was seen no more. The defendant, asked to produce the girl in court, had fraudulently produced another girl disguised as the niece. The court presumed him guilty on this basis and he was executed. Later, the niece was found, alive and well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=TC | last=Granger | title=A Digest of the Law of Evidence in Criminal Cases | publisher=Benning and co | year=1846 | page=18 | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ifFiAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA18&amp;lpg=RA1-PA18&amp;dq=Hale,+2P.C.290(n)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WCEInjyO8T&amp;sig=vdmOWhomV6cRdpLo4JCG7pkCPVY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8-LyF5ZPZAhWywVkKHbOrCZ0Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hale%2C%202P.C.290(n)&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual violence and harassment ==

The American actor and producer [[Jeremy Piven]] has spoken out against the [[Me Too movement]], which, he claims, 'put lives in jeopardy without a hearing, due process or evidence'. Writing about Piven's comment, journalist [[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]], suggests that the presumption of innocence, which barrister and writer [[John Mortimer]] described as a 'golden thread', is being weakened.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)]], 'Whatever Happened to the Presumption of Innocence?', ''Los Angeles Times'', 16 November 2017. [http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-oneill-presumption-innocent-sex-harassment-20171116-story.html]. Accessed 6 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

High Court judge Sir [[Richard Henriques]] has criticized UK police training and methods which allegedly assert that 'only 0.1% of rape allegations are false' ('lying with statistics' or straight-out lie to prejudice, this is better than 'accusers never lie', which is obviously false.) and in which all complainants are treated as 'victims' from the start. In three cases which later collapsed, including those of Liam Allan and Danny Kay, police withheld vital evidence from the defence. &lt;ref&gt;[[Marco Giannangeli]], 'Police must stop training 'Presumption of Guilt', says High Court judge', Daily Express, 24 December 2017. [https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/896348/police-rape-case-collapse-high-court-judge-officer-training-presumption-of-guilt]. Accessed 6 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to assess the true prevalence of [[False accusation of rape|false rape allegations]], but it is generally agreed that rape accusations are false about 2% to 10% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;DiCanio, M.

In March 2017 Elizabeth Truss, Justice Secretary, said "that from September juries across the country will watch the pre-recorded cross-examinations during a trial".&lt;ref&gt;Laura Hughes, "Rape victims to be spared court cross-examination as Government brings forward plans for pre-recorded video evidence".

In 1990, Yale professor and [[radical feminist]] [[Catharine MacKinnon]], is alleged to have addressed a graduation crowd thus; 'look about you.

[[The Old Side-New Side Controversy|New Light]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] founded the College of New Jersey in 1746 in order to train ministers.&lt;ref name = Princeton&gt;{{cite web | title = Princeton University 250th Anniversary Celebration Collection|url= http://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/AC180/#description |work= Library Finding Aids|publisher= Princeton University |accessdate= 11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college was the educational and religious capital of Scottish Presbyterian America. In 1754, trustees of the College of New Jersey suggested that, in recognition of Governor [[Jonathan Belcher]]'s interest, Princeton should be named as Belcher College. Belcher replied: "[[belching|What a name]] that would be!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Princeton Alumni Weekly |date=1933 |page=487|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uhJbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487&amp;dq=jonathan+belcher++++princeton++what+the+hell+of&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_0vYwy0gtt&amp;sig=6_AUl6-04_GJUFx8PIDz3_R7hDU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI7NO0-KC9xwIVAx8eCh0Yfwbj#v=onepage&amp;q=jonathan%20belcher%20%20%20%20princeton%20%20what%20the%20hell%20of&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1756, the college moved to Princeton, New Jersey. Its home in Princeton was [[Nassau Hall]], named for the royal [[House of Orange-Nassau]] of [[William III of England]].

Following the untimely deaths of Princeton's first five [[President of Princeton University|presidents]], [[John Witherspoon]] became president in 1768 and remained in that office until his death in 1794. During his presidency, Witherspoon shifted the college's focus from training ministers to preparing a new generation for secular leadership in the new American nation. To this end, he tightened academic standards and solicited investment in the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jeffry H | last = Morrison | title = John Witherspoon and the Founding of the American Republic | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witherspoon's presidency constituted a long period of stability for the college, interrupted by the [[American Revolution]] and particularly the [[Battle of Princeton]], during which British soldiers briefly occupied Nassau Hall; American forces, led by [[George Washington]], fired [[cannon]] on the building to rout them from it.

In 1812, the eighth president of the College of New Jersey, Ashbel Green (1812–23), helped establish the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] next door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/pub/presidents/green/|title=Ashbel Green – The Presidents of Princeton University|first=Princeton|last=University|publisher=|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan to extend the theological curriculum met with "enthusiastic approval on the part of the authorities at the College of New Jersey".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ptsem.edu/index.aspx?menu1_id=2030&amp;menu2_id=2031&amp;id=1264|title=Princeton Theological Seminary|publisher=|accessdate=June 29, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519161941/http://www.ptsem.edu/index.aspx?menu1_id=2030&amp;menu2_id=2031&amp;id=1264|archivedate=May 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Princeton University and Princeton Theological Seminary maintain separate institutions with ties that include services such as cross-registration and mutual library access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Before the construction of Stanhope Hall in 1803, Nassau Hall was the college's sole building. The cornerstone of the building was laid on September 17, 1754.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Oberdorfer |first=Don |authorlink=Don Oberdorfer |publisher=Trustees of Princeton University |date=1995 |isbn=0-691-01122-2 |title=Princeton University: The First 250 Years|page=24|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 1783, the [[Continental Congress]] met in Nassau Hall, making Princeton the [[United States capital|country's capital]] for four months.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_item/Nine_Capitals_of_the_United_States.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries and through two redesigns following major fires (1802 and 1855), Nassau Hall's role shifted from an all-purpose building, comprising office, dormitory, library, and classroom space; to classroom space exclusively; to its present role as the administrative center of the University. The class of 1879 donated twin [[lion sculpture]]s that flanked the entrance until 1911, when that same class replaced them with tigers.&lt;ref name=apc-nassau-hall/&gt; Nassau Hall's bell rang after the hall's construction; however, the fire of 1802 melted it. The bell was then recast and melted again in the fire of 1855.&lt;ref name="apc-nassau-hall" /&gt;

[[File:Princeton University, 1906.jpg|thumb|left|A Birds-eye view of campus in 1906]]

[[James McCosh]] took office as the college's president in 1868 and lifted the institution out of a low period that had been brought about by the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = McCosh, James|last = Leitch|first = Alexander|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1978|isbn = 9780691046549|location = Princeton, New Jersey|pages = |url = http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/mccosh_james.html|oclc = 4193433|work = A Princeton Companion}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his two decades of service, he overhauled the curriculum, oversaw an expansion of inquiry into the sciences, and supervised the addition of a number of buildings in the [[High Victorian Gothic]] style to the campus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; McCosh Hall is named in his honor.&lt;ref name=apc-nassau-hall /&gt;

In 1879, the first thesis for a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] Ph.D. was submitted by James F. Williamson, Class of 1877.

In 1896, the college officially changed its name from the College of New Jersey to Princeton University to honor the town in which it resides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=April|title=When Did the College of New Jersey Change to Princeton University?|url=https://blogs.princeton.edu/mudd/2015/07/when-did-the-college-of-new-jersey-change-to-princeton-university/|website=Mudd Manuscript Library Blog|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this year, the college also underwent large expansion and officially became a university. In 1900, the Graduate School was established.&lt;ref name="chronology"&gt;{{cite book |last=Oberdorfer |first=Don |authorlink=Don Oberdorfer |publisher=Trustees of Princeton University |date=1995 |isbn=0-691-01122-2 |title=Princeton University: The First 250 Years|pages=268–269|edition=First|chapter=A Princeton Chronology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, [[Woodrow Wilson]], graduate of the Class of 1879, was elected the 13th president of the university.&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; Under Wilson, Princeton introduced the preceptorial system in 1905, a then-unique concept in the US that augmented the standard lecture method of teaching with a more personal form in which small groups of students, or precepts, could interact with a single instructor, or preceptor, in their field of interest.

In 1906, the reservoir [[Lake Carnegie]] was created by [[Andrew Carnegie]].&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; A collection of historical photographs of the building of the lake is housed at the [[Seeley G.

While always independent of the university, the Institute for Advanced Study occupied offices in Jones Hall for 6 years, from its opening in 1933, until its own campus was finished and opened in 1939. This helped start an incorrect impression that it was part of the university, one that has never been completely eradicated.

In 1969, Princeton University first admitted women as undergraduates. In 1887, the university actually maintained and staffed a [[sister college]], [[Evelyn College for Women]], in the town of Princeton on Evelyn and Nassau streets. It was closed after roughly a decade of operation. After abortive discussions with [[Sarah Lawrence College]] to relocate the women's college to Princeton and merge it with the University in 1967, the administration decided to admit women and turned to the issue of transforming the school's operations and facilities into a female-friendly campus. The administration had barely finished these plans in April 1969 when the admissions office began mailing out its acceptance letters. Its five-year coeducation plan provided $7.8 million for the development of new facilities that would eventually house and educate 650 women students at Princeton by 1974. Ultimately, 148 women, consisting of 100 freshmen and transfer students of other years, entered Princeton on September 6, 1969 amidst much media attention. Princeton enrolled its first female graduate student, Sabra Follett Meservey, as a PhD candidate in [[Turkish history]] in 1961. A handful of undergraduate women had studied at Princeton from 1963 on, spending their junior year there to study "critical languages" in which Princeton's offerings surpassed those of their home institutions. They were considered regular students for their year on campus, but were not candidates for a Princeton degree.

As a result of a 1979 lawsuit by Sally Frank, [[Eating club (Princeton University)|Princeton's eating clubs]] were required to go coeducational in 1991, after [[Tiger Inn]]'s appeal to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Associated Press | title = Princeton Eating Club Loses Bid to Continue Ban on Women | newspaper = The Los Angeles Times | date = January 23, 1991 | page = A4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the university changed the gendered lyrics of "Old Nassau" to reflect the school's co-educational student body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/01/nyregion/princeton-song-goes-coed.html | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 1987-03-01 | title = Princeton song goes coed}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009-11, Princeton professor [[Nannerl O.

===Cannon Green===

[[File:Cannon Green Princeton c1909.jpg|thumb|Cannon Green ca. 1909, with East Pyne, Whig and Clio Halls]]

Buried in the ground at the center of the lawn south of Nassau Hall is the "Big Cannon," which was left in Princeton by British troops as they fled following the [[Battle of Princeton]]. It remained in Princeton until the [[War of 1812]], when it was taken to [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hageman |first=John Frelinghuysen |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions |volume=1 |year=1879 |edition=2nd |publisher=J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. |location=Philadelphia |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836 the cannon was returned to Princeton and placed at the eastern end of town. It was removed to the campus under cover of night by Princeton students in 1838 and buried in its current location in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hageman |first=John Frelinghuysen |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions |volume=2 |year=1879 |edition=2nd |publisher=J.

A second "Little Cannon" is buried in the lawn in front of nearby [[American Whig-Cliosophic Society|Whig Hall]]. This cannon, which may also have been captured in the Battle of Princeton, was stolen by students of [[Rutgers University]] in 1875. The theft ignited the [[Rutgers-Princeton Cannon War]]. A compromise between the presidents of Princeton and Rutgers ended the war and forced the return of the Little Cannon to Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hageman |first=John Frelinghuysen |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions|volume=2|year=1879|edition=2nd|publisher=J.

Princeton has six undergraduate [[residential college]]s, each housing approximately 500 freshmen, sophomores, some juniors and seniors, and a handful of junior and senior [[Resident assistant|resident advisers]]. Each college consists of a set of dormitories, a dining hall, a variety of other amenities—such as study spaces, libraries, performance spaces, and darkrooms—and a collection of administrators and associated faculty. Two colleges, [[Wilson College, Princeton University|Wilson College]] and [[Forbes College, Princeton University|Forbes College]] (formerly Princeton Inn College), date to the 1970s; three others, [[Rockefeller College|Rockefeller]], [[Mathey College|Mathey]], and [[Butler College|Butler]] Colleges, were created in 1983 following the Committee on Undergraduate Residential Life (CURL) report, which suggested the institution of residential colleges as a solution to an allegedly fragmented campus social life. The construction of [[Whitman College, Princeton University|Whitman College]], the university's sixth residential college, was completed in 2007.

Rockefeller and Mathey are located in the northwest corner of the campus; Princeton brochures often feature their Collegiate Gothic architecture. Like most of Princeton's Gothic buildings, they predate the residential college system and were fashioned into colleges from individual dormitories.

Wilson and Butler, located south of the center of the campus, were built in the 1960s. Wilson served as an early experiment in the establishment of the residential college system. Butler, like Rockefeller and Mathey, consisted of a collection of ordinary dorms (called the "New New Quad") before the addition of a dining hall made it a residential college. Widely disliked for their edgy modernist design, including "waffle ceilings", the dormitories on the Butler Quad were demolished in 2007. Butler is now reopened as a four-year residential college, housing both [[Upperclassman|under- and upperclassmen]].

Forbes is located on the site of the historic Princeton Inn, a gracious hotel overlooking the Princeton golf course. The Princeton Inn, originally constructed in 1924, played regular host to important symposia and gatherings of renowned scholars from both the university and the nearby [[Institute for Advanced Study]] for many years.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Princeton Companion|last = Leitch|first = Alexander|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1978|isbn = 9780691046549|location = Princeton, New Jersey|chapter = West, Andrew Fleming|oclc = 4193433|chapter-url = http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/west_andrew.html}}{{Self-published inline|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes currently houses over 400 undergraduates and a number of resident graduate students in its residential halls.

In 2003, Princeton broke ground for a sixth college named [[Whitman College, Princeton University|Whitman College]] after its principal sponsor, [[Meg Whitman]], who graduated from Princeton in 1977. The new dormitories were constructed in the [[Collegiate Gothic]] architectural style and were designed by architect [[Demetri Porphyrios]]. Construction finished in 2007, and Whitman College was inaugurated as Princeton's sixth residential college that same year.

The precursor of the present college system in America was originally proposed by university president Woodrow Wilson in the early 20th century. For over 800 years, however, the collegiate system had already existed in Britain at Cambridge and Oxford Universities. Wilson's model was much closer to Yale's present system, which features four-year colleges. Lacking the support of the [[Trustees of Princeton University|trustees]], the plan languished until 1968. That year, Wilson College was established to cap a series of alternatives to the eating clubs. Fierce debates raged before the present residential college system emerged. The plan was first attempted at Yale, but the administration was initially uninterested; an exasperated alum, [[Edward Harkness]], finally paid to have the college system implemented at Harvard in the 1920s, leading to the oft-quoted aphorism that the college system is a Princeton idea that was executed at Harvard with funding from Yale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/TNEQ_a_00090#.VGSgkJOsUk8 |first=Benjamin |last=Sacks |title=Harvard's "Constructed Utopia" and the Culture of Deception: The Expansion toward the Charles River, 1902-1932 |publisher=The New England Quarterly | date= June 2011 | accessdate =November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princeton has one graduate residential college, known simply as the Graduate College, located beyond Forbes College at the outskirts of campus. The far-flung location of the GC was the spoil of a squabble between Woodrow Wilson and then-Graduate School Dean [[Andrew Fleming West]]. Wilson preferred a central location for the College; West wanted the graduate students as far as possible from the campus. Ultimately, West prevailed.&lt;ref name = "autogenerated1" /&gt; The Graduate College is composed of a large [[Collegiate Gothic]] section crowned by [[Cleveland Tower]], a local landmark that also houses a world-class [[carillon]]. The attached New Graduate College departs in its design from Collegiate Gothic; it is reminiscent of the former dormitories of Butler College, the newest of the five pre-Whitman residential colleges.

Today, the Triangle Club performs its annual freshmen revue, fall show, and Reunions performances in McCarter. McCarter is also recognized as one of the leading regional theaters in the United States.

====Art Museum====
{{main|Princeton University Art Museum}}

[[File:Art Museum Princeton.JPG|thumb|left|The Art Museum]]

The [[Princeton University Art Museum]] was established in 1882 to give students direct, intimate, and sustained access to original works of art that complement and enrich instruction and research at the university. This continues to be a primary function, along with serving as a community resource and a destination for national and international visitors.

Numbering over 92,000 objects, the collections range from ancient to contemporary art and concentrate geographically on the [[Mediterranean]] regions, Western Europe, China, the United States, and Latin America. There is a collection of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|antiquities]], including [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], marbles, bronzes, and Roman mosaics from faculty excavations in [[Antioch]]. [[Medieval]] Europe is represented by sculpture, metalwork, and stained glass. The collection of Western European paintings includes examples from the early [[Renaissance]] through the 19th century, with masterpieces by Monet, Cézanne, and Van Gogh, and features a growing collection of 20th-century and contemporary art, including iconic paintings such as Andy Warhol's Blue Marilyn.

One of the best features of the museums is its collection of Chinese art, with important holdings in bronzes, tomb figurines, painting, and [[calligraphy]]. Its collection of [[pre-Columbian]] art includes examples of Mayan art, and is commonly considered to be the most important collection of pre-Columbian art outside of Latin America. The museum has collections of old master prints and drawings and a comprehensive collection of over 27,000 original photographs. African art and Northwest Coast Indian art are also represented. The Museum also oversees the outdoor Putnam Collection of Sculpture.

==Demographics==
{{expand section|date=August 2018}}
In 1999, 10% of the student body was Jewish, a percentage lower than those at other [[Ivy League]] schools. Sixteen percent of the student body was Jewish in 1985; the number decreased by 40% from 1985 to 1999. This decline prompted ''[[The Daily Princetonian]]'' to write a series of articles on the decline and its reasons. Caroline C. Pam of ''[[The New York Observer]]'' wrote that Princeton was "long dogged by a reputation for [[anti-Semitism]]" and that this history as well as Princeton's elite status caused the university and its community to feel sensitivity towards the decrease of Jewish students.&lt;ref name=PamCarolineJewish&gt;{{cite web|author=Pam, Caroline C.|url=http://observer.com/1999/05/enrollment-of-jews-at-princeton-drops-by-40-percent-in-15-years/|title=Enrollment of Jews at Princeton Drops by 40 Percent in 15 Years|publisher=''[[The New York Observer]]''|date=1999-05-31|accessdate=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time many Jewish students at Princeton dated Jewish students at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]] because they perceived Princeton as an environment where it was difficult to find romantic prospects; Pam stated that there was a theory that the dating issues were a cause of the decline in Jewish students.&lt;ref name=PamCarolineJewish/&gt;

==Organization==
The Trustees of Princeton University, a 40-member board, is responsible for the overall direction of the University. It approves the operating and capital budgets, supervises the investment of the University's endowment and oversees campus real estate and long-range physical planning. The trustees also exercise prior review and approval concerning changes in major policies, such as those in instructional programs and admission, as well as tuition and fees and the hiring of faculty members.

With an endowment of $22.15 billion, Princeton University is among the wealthiest universities in the world. Ranked in 2010 as the [[List of US colleges and universities by endowment|third]] largest endowment in the United States, the university had the greatest per-student endowment in the world (over $2 million for undergraduates) in 2011.&lt;ref name="CNBC"&gt;{{cite news |title = Colleges with the Biggest Endowment Per Student|year = 2011|work = CNBC.com|url = https://www.cnbc.com/id/41834274/Colleges_with_the_Biggest_Endowment_Per_Student?slide=11|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130531100005/http://www.cnbc.com/id/41834274/Colleges_with_the_Biggest_Endowment_Per_Student?slide=11|archive-date = May 31, 2013 |others = Praefcke, Andreas (photo credit)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a significant endowment is sustained through the continued donations of its alumni and is maintained by investment advisers.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite news |title = Endowment Climbs Past $13 Billion|work = [[Dly.

==Academics==

[[File:University Library, Princeton University-LCCN2008679653.tif|thumb|left|East Pyne Hall, home to several departments in the [[humanities]], in a 1903 photo when it served as the University library]]

Undergraduates fulfill general education requirements, choose among a wide variety of elective courses, and pursue departmental concentrations and interdisciplinary certificate programs. Required independent work is a hallmark of undergraduate education at Princeton. Students graduate with either the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or the Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E.).

The [[graduate school]] offers advanced degrees spanning the [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], [[natural sciences]], and engineering. [[Doctorate|Doctoral education]] is available in most disciplines.&lt;ref name="degree programs"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.princeton.edu/main/academics/departments/|title = Departments &amp; Programs|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = October 19, 2015|date = October 1, 2015}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes original and independent scholarship whereas master's degree programs in architecture, engineering, finance, and public affairs and public policy prepare candidates for careers in public life and professional practice.

===Undergraduate===

[[File:McCosh 50 (front).jpg|thumb|McCosh 50, the largest lecture hall on campus]]

Undergraduate courses in the humanities are traditionally either seminars or lectures held 2 or 3 times a week with an additional discussion seminar that is called a "precept." To graduate, all A.B. candidates must complete a senior thesis and, in most departments, one or two extensive pieces of independent research that are known as "junior papers." Juniors in some departments, including architecture and the creative arts, complete independent projects that differ from written research papers. A.B. candidates must also fulfill a three or four semester foreign language requirement and distribution requirements with a total of 31 classes. B.S.E. candidates follow a parallel track with an emphasis on a rigorous science and math curriculum, a computer science requirement, and at least two semesters of independent research including an optional senior thesis. All B.S.E. students must complete at least 36 classes. A.B. candidates typically have more freedom in course selection than B.S.E. candidates because of the fewer number of required classes. Nonetheless, in the spirit of a [[liberal arts]] education, both enjoy a comparatively high degree of latitude in creating a self-structured curriculum.

Undergraduates agree to adhere to an academic integrity policy called the Honor Code, established in 1893. Under the Honor Code, faculty do not proctor examinations; instead, the students proctor one another and must report any suspected violation to an Honor Committee made up of undergraduates. The Committee investigates reported violations and holds a hearing if it is warranted. An acquittal at such a hearing results in the destruction of all records of the hearing; a conviction results in the student's suspension or expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.princeton.edu/honor/about_us/|title = About Us|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = October 19, 2015|at = Role of Honor Committee|website = Honor Committee|date = May 19, 2015}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signed pledge required by the Honor Code is so integral to students' academic experience that the [[Princeton Triangle Club]] performs a song about it each fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/academics_101/honor_code/|title = Honor Code|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = June 1, 2011 |website = The Student Guide to Princeton|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100615074938/http://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/academics_101/honor_code/|archivedate = June 15, 2010}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}} {{Dead link |date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vNf_W6wE68|title = Honor Code|type = YouTube video|year = 2008|others = music and lyrics by Peter Mills|access-date = October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out-of-class exercises fall under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.princeton.edu/odus/standards/discipline/|title = Committee on Discipline|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = October 23, 2015|website = ODUS: Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students|date = August 25, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151103152504/http://www.princeton.edu/odus/standards/discipline/|archive-date = November 3, 2015|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduates are expected to sign a pledge on their written work affirming that they have not [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.princeton.edu/pr/pub/integrity/pages/sources/|title = Acknowledging Your Sources|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = October 23, 2015|date = August 2011|website = Academic Integrity}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princeton's undergraduate program is highly selective, admitting 6.1% of undergraduate applicants in the 2016-2017 admissions cycle (for the Class of 2021).&lt;ref name=CDS/&gt;  The middle 50% range of [[SAT]] scores were 690-790 for critical reading, 710-800 for math, and 700-790 for writing.&lt;ref name=CDS/&gt;  The middle 50% range of the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] Composite score was 32-35.&lt;ref name=CDS/&gt;

====Grade deflation policy====
[[File:Einstein_classroom.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Room 302 is a lecture hall at [[Frist Campus Center]] restored to its condition when [[Albert Einstein]] taught there]]

In 2004, Nancy Weiss Malkiel, the Dean of the College, implemented a grade deflation policy to curb the number of A-range grades undergraduates received.&lt;ref name="On grade deflation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2009/12/02/24601/|publisher=''The Daily Princetonian''|title=On grade deflation|year=2009|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malkiel's argument was that an A was beginning to lose its meaning as a larger percentage of the student body received them.&lt;ref name="On grade deflation"/&gt; While the number of A's has indeed decreased under the policy, many argue that this is hurting Princeton students when they apply to jobs or graduate school.&lt;ref name="On grade deflation"/&gt; Malkiel has said that she sent pamphlets to inform institutions about the policy so that they consider Princeton students equally,&lt;ref name="On grade deflation"/&gt; but students argue that Princeton graduates can apply to other institutions that know nothing about it.

The policy deflates grades only relative to their previous levels; indeed, as of 2009, or five years after the policy was instituted, the average graduating GPA saw a marginal decrease, from 3.46 to 3.39.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/education/31princeton.html?_r=1|work=New York Times|title=At Princeton University, Grumbling About Grade Deflation|accessdate=January 28, 2011 | first=Lisa | last=Foderaro | date=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, a faculty committee tasked by Dean of the College [[Valerie Smith (academic)|Valerie Smith]] to review the effectiveness of grade deflation found not only that the 35% target was both often misinterpreted as a hard quota and applied inconsistently across departments, but also that grades had begun to decline in 2003, the year before the policy was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mulvaney|first1=Nicole|title=No more A quotas: Faculty committee recommends Princeton University change its grading policy |url=http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2014/08/no_more_a_quotas_faculty_committee_recommends_princeton_university_change_its_grading_policy.html|accessdate=5 June 2015 |work=nj.com|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S42/45/30C97/index.xml?section=topstories|title=Princeton University - Valerie Smith appointed president of Swarthmore College|website=www.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316001345/http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S42/45/30C97/index.xml?section=topstories|archivedate=March 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee concluded that the observed lower grades since 2003 were the result of discussions and increased awareness during and since the implementation of the deflation policy, and not the deflation targets themselves, so recommended removing the numerical targets while charging individual departments with developing consistent standards for grading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report from the Ad Hoc Committee to Review Policies Regarding Assessment and Grading |url=https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S40/73/33I92/PU_Grading_Policy_Report_2014_Aug.pdf|accessdate=5 June 2015|date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, following a faculty vote, the numerical targets were removed as recommended by the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Windemuth|first1=Anna|title=After faculty vote, grade deflation policy officially dead |url=http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2014/10/breaking-after-faculty-vote-grade-deflation-policy-officially-dead/|accessdate=5 June 2015|work=The Daily Princetonian|date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

University housing is guaranteed to all undergraduates for all four years. More than 98% of students live on campus in dormitories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/profile/campus-life/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017193259/http://www.princeton.edu/profile/campus-life/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 17, 2008 |title=Housing and Dining |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=June 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Freshmen and sophomores must live in [[residential college]]s, while juniors and seniors typically live in designated upperclassman dormitories. The actual dormitories are comparable, but only residential colleges have dining halls. Nonetheless, any undergraduate may purchase a meal plan and eat in a residential college dining hall. Recently, upperclassmen have been given the option of remaining in their college for all four years. Juniors and seniors also have the option of living off-campus, but high rent in the Princeton area encourages almost all students to live in university housing. Undergraduate social life revolves around the residential colleges and a number of coeducational [[Eating club (Princeton University)|eating clubs]], which students may choose to join in the spring of their sophomore year. Eating clubs, which are not officially affiliated with the university, serve as dining halls and communal spaces for their members and also host social events throughout the academic year.

Princeton's six residential colleges host a variety of social events and activities, guest speakers, and trips. The residential colleges also sponsor trips to New York for undergraduates to see ballets, operas, Broadway shows, sports events, and other activities.
The eating clubs, located on Prospect Avenue, are co-ed organizations for upperclassmen. Most upperclassmen eat their meals at one of the eleven eating clubs. Additionally, the clubs serve as evening and weekend social venues for members and guests.

Princeton hosts two [[Model United Nations]] conferences, PMUNC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmunc.org/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321211627/http://www.pmunc.org/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 21, 2005|title=Princeton Model United Nations Conference (PMUNC)|accessdate=June 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the fall for high school students and PDI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonirc.org/|title=Princeton Interactive Crisis Simulation (PICSIM)|accessdate=June 25, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820185207/http://www.picsim.org/|archivedate=August 20, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the spring for college students. It also hosts the Princeton Invitational Speech and Debate tournament each year at the end of November. Princeton also runs Princeton Model Congress, an event that is held once a year in mid-November. The four-day conference has high school students from around the country as participants.

Although the school's admissions policy is [[need blind]], Princeton, based on the proportion of students who receive Pell Grants, was ranked as a school with little economic diversity among all national universities ranked by ''U.S. News &amp; World Report''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-economic-diversity-among-top-ranked-schools |title=Economic Diversity Among All National Universities |accessdate=October 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826131543/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-economic-diversity-among-top-ranked-schools |archivedate=August 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Pell figures are widely used as a gauge of the number of low-income undergraduates on a given campus, the rankings article cautions "the proportion of students on Pell Grants isn't a perfect measure of an institution's efforts to achieve economic diversity," but goes on to say that "still, many experts say that Pell figures are the best available gauge of how many low-income undergrads there are on a given campus."

The free concerts take place in one of the larger arches on campus. Most are held in Blair Arch or Class of 1879 Arch.
* ''Bonfire'' – Ceremonial bonfire that takes place in Cannon Green behind Nassau Hall. It is held only if Princeton beats both [[Harvard University]] and [[Yale University]] at [[College football|football]] in the same season. The most recent bonfire was lighted on November 23, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bonfire!!!|url=https://blogs.princeton.edu/mudd/2012/11/bonfire/|website=Mudd Manuscript Library Blog|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Cane Spree'' – An athletic competition between freshmen and sophomores that is held in the fall. The event centers on cane wrestling, where a freshman and a sophomore will grapple for control of a cane. This commemorates a time in the 1870s when sophomores, angry with the freshmen who strutted around with fancy canes, stole all of the canes from the freshmen, hitting them with their own canes in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Clockwork Orange|title=Cane-Spree the history|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~clockwrk/canespree/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422062428/http://www.princeton.edu/~clockwrk/canespree/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 22, 2008|publisher=Princeton University|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Communiversity'' – An annual street fair with performances, arts and crafts, and other activities that attempts to foster interaction between the university community and the residents of Princeton.
* ''Dean's Date'' – The Tuesday at the end of each semester when all written work is due. This day signals the end of reading period and the beginning of final examinations. Traditionally, undergraduates gather outside McCosh Hall before the 5:00 PM deadline to cheer on fellow students who have left their work to the very last minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~oktour/virtualtour/Hist04-DeansDate.htm |title=Dean's Date |work=Virtual tour |publisher=Princeton |accessdate=July 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819155309/http://www.princeton.edu/~oktour/virtualtour/Hist04-DeansDate.htm |archivedate=August 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[FitzRandolph Gate]]s'' – At the end of Princeton's graduation ceremony, the new graduates process out through the main gate of the university as a symbol of the fact that they are leaving college. According to tradition, anyone who exits campus through the FitzRandolph Gates before his or her own graduation date will not graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Nathaniel FitzRandolph's Descendants Attend Princeton University for Free?|url=https://blogs.princeton.edu/mudd/2015/06/can-nathaniel-fitzrandolphs-descendants-attend-princeton-university-for-free/|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Nathaniel FitzRandolph's Descendants Attend Princeton University for Free?|url=https://blogs.princeton.edu/mudd/2015/06/can-nathaniel-fitzrandolphs-descendants-attend-princeton-university-for-free/|website=Mudd Manuscript Library Blog|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Gilding the Lily'' – Promotion ceremony at the 25th reunion of a class. Alumnae of the University (or "Tiger Lilies") enjoy the courting of male classmates, amid song and much drink (see Newman's Day). Traditional chants include "In Princeton Town the Youth abound, and do young Tigers make. Women return as Gilded Lilies, the men as Frosted Flakes".
* ''Holder Howl'' – The midnight before Dean's Date, students from Holder Hall and elsewhere gather in the Holder courtyard and take part in a minute-long, communal primal scream to vent frustration from studying with impromptu, late night noise making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tigernet.princeton.edu/~ptoniana/poler.asp| title=Poler's Recess | work = Ptoniana | publisher = Princeton | accessdate=July 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princeton supports organized athletics at three levels: varsity intercollegiate, club intercollegiate, and intramural. It also provides "a variety of physical education and recreational programs" for members of the Princeton community. According to the athletics program's mission statement, Princeton aims for its students who participate in athletics to be "'student athletes' in the fullest sense of the phrase."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.goprincetontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10600&amp;ATCLID=295151 |title = Princeton University Mission Statement |accessdate = Jun 1, 2011 |author = Princeton Athletic Communications |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111223084238/http://www.goprincetontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10600&amp;ATCLID=295151 |archivedate = December 23, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most undergraduates participate in athletics at some level.&lt;ref name=puathfit-main&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/main/campuslife/athletics/ |title=Athletics &amp; Fitness |accessdate= Jun 1, 2011 | publisher = Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princeton's colors are orange and black. The school's athletes are known as ''Tigers'', and the mascot is a tiger. The Princeton administration considered naming the mascot in 2007, but the effort was dropped in the face of alumni opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2007/09/11/18534/ |title=Mascot revamped but still 'The Tiger' | first =Esther | last = Breger |date=Sep 11, 2007 |newspaper=The Daily Princetonian | accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princeton is an [[NCAA Division I]] school. Its athletic conference is the [[Ivy League]]. Princeton hosts 38 men's and women's varsity sports.&lt;ref name=puathfit-main /&gt; The largest varsity sport is rowing, with almost 150 athletes.&lt;ref name=rowing-recruiting /&gt;

[[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton's football team]] has a long and storied history. Princeton played against [[Rutgers University]] in the [[1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game|first intercollegiate football game in the U.S.]] on Nov 6, 1869. By a score of 6–4, Rutgers won the game, which was played by rules similar to modern rugby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scarletknights.com/football/history/first-game.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128220156/http://www.scarletknights.com/football/history/first-game.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 28, 2006 |title=The First Intercollegiate Game – November 6, 1869 |publisher=Rutgers University Scarlet Knights |accessdate=Jun 2, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today Princeton is a member of the Football Championship Subdivision of NCAA Division I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.championshipsubdivision.com/teams-stadiums-directory/ivy-league/princeton-tigers-princeton-stadium/ |title=Princeton Tigers, Princeton Stadium |publisher=Football Championship Subdivision | accessdate = Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the end of the 2010 season, Princeton had won 26 national football championships, more than any other school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/national_championships/nchamps_team.php |title=Recognized National Championships by Team |publisher=College Football Data Warehouse |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920001615/http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/national_championships/nchamps_team.php |archivedate=September 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Princeton Tigers men's basketball|men's basketball program]] is noted for its success under [[Pete Carril]], the head coach from 1967 to 1996. During this time, Princeton won 13 Ivy League titles and made 11 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nba.com/coachfile/pete_carril/ |title= Pete Carril |publisher=NBA |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carril introduced the [[Princeton offense]], an offensive strategy that has since been adopted by a number of college and professional basketball teams.&lt;ref name= carril-nyt&gt;{{cite news |title=Carril Is Yoda to Notion of Perpetual Motion | first =John | last = Branch |newspaper=The New York Times |date= Mar 30, 2007 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/30/sports/ncaabasketball/30carril.html |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carril's final victory at Princeton came when the Tigers beat [[UCLA]], the defending national champion, in the opening round of the [[1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1996 NCAA tournament]],&lt;ref name = carril-nyt /&gt; in what is considered one of the greatest upsets in the history of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/ncaatourneyupset.html | title= When underdogs dance | publisher = ESPN | accessdate = Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently Princeton tied the record for the fewest points in a Division I game since the institution of the three-point line in 1986–87, when the Tigers scored 21 points in a loss against [[Monmouth University]] on Dec 14, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap/_/id/253480163/monmouth-hawks-vs-princeton-tigers | title = Princeton loses lowest-scoring D-I game since 3-point line | agency = Associated Press | publisher = ESPN |date=Dec 15, 2005 | accessdate =Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The men's [[water polo]] team is currently a dominant force in the Collegiate Water Polo Association, having reached the [[Final Four]] in two of the last three years. Similarly, the [[Princeton Tigers men's lacrosse|men's lacrosse program]] enjoyed a period of dominance 1992–2001, during which time it won six national championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usila.org/NCAAChampionHistory.htm |title=The NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship, formerly known as the Wingate Memorial Champion | publisher= US Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association | accessdate = Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Club and intramural===

[[File:Princeton students after a freshman vs. sophomores snowball fight in 1893.jpg|thumb|Princeton students after a freshman vs. sophomores snowball fight in 1893]]

In addition to varsity sports, Princeton hosts about 35 club sports teams.&lt;ref name=puathfit-main /&gt; [[Princeton Rugby|Princeton's rugby team]] is organized as a club sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=One of Princeton's oldest clubs flourishes | first =Ben | last = Laguna |date=Apr 3, 2008 |newspaper=The Daily Princetonian |url = http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2008/04/03/20695/ |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, nearly 300 teams participate in intramural sports at Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/campus_culture/intramurals/ |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071222000136/http://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/campus_culture/intramurals/ |dead-url = yes |archive-date = December 22, 2007 |title = The Student Guide to Princeton: Intramurals |publisher = Princeton University |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intramurals are open to members of Princeton's faculty, staff, and students, though a team representing a residential college or eating club must consist only of members of that college or club. Several leagues with differing levels of competitiveness are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/campusrec/intramural/general-information/ |title=General Information |publisher=Princeton University Campus Recreation |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301120351/http://www.princeton.edu/campusrec/intramural/general-information/ |archivedate=March 1, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Songs==
Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], and athletic games is [[Princeton Cannon Song]], the Princeton University [[fight song]].

[[Bob Dylan]] wrote "Day of The Locusts" (for his 1970 album ''[[New Morning#Day of the Locusts|New Morning]]'') about his experience of receiving an honorary doctorate from the University. It is a reference to the negative experience he had and it mentions the [[Brood X]] [[cicada]] infestation Princeton experienced that June 1970.

==="Old Nassau"===
{{main|Old Nassau}}
{{listen
 | filename = Old Nassau.ogg
 | title = Old Nassau

}}
"[[s:Old Nassau|Old Nassau]]" has been Princeton University's anthem since 1859. Its words were written that year by a freshman, Harlan Page Peck, and published in the March issue of the ''Nassau Literary Review'' (the oldest student publication at Princeton and also the second oldest undergraduate literary magazine in the country). The words and music appeared together for the first time in ''Songs of Old Nassau'', published in April 1859. Before the Langlotz tune was written, the song was sung to ''[[Auld Lang Syne]]'''s melody, which also fits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tigernet.princeton.edu/~ptoniana/oldnassau2.asp| title=History of Old Nassau|accessdate=July 5, 2008 | publisher = Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Old Nassau does not only refer to the university's anthem. It can also refer to Nassau Hall, the building that was built in 1756 and named after [[William III of England|William III]] of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. When built, it was the largest college building in North America. It served briefly as the capitol of the United States when the Continental Congress convened there in the summer of 1783. By [[metonymy]], the term can refer to the university as a whole. Finally, it can also refer to a [[chemical reaction]] that is dubbed "[[Old Nassau reaction]]" because the solution turns orange and then black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed054p167.2 |title=The Old Nassau reaction | work = Journal of Chemical Education | publisher = ACS Publications and Division of Chemical Education | accessdate = February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9980">An individual's or community's '''religious orientation''' involves [[presumption]]s about the existence and nature of God or gods, religious prescriptions about morality and communal and personal spirituality. Such presumptions involve the study of psychology, ethics, sociology and anthropology.

==Psychology==

According to Whitley and Kite, researchers who were interested in studying the psychological effects of religion on prejudice initially studied the relationship between simple indicators of religiosity such as whether or not a person went to church and the level of prejudice that that person showed. Surprisingly these researchers found that "religious involvement was consistently correlated with a variety of forms of prejudice." (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010) &lt;ref name=kite&gt;Whitley, B.E. &amp; Kite, M.E. (2010). The psychology of prejudice and discrimination. Belmont, CA. 	Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturally these findings were not well received by religious leaders or the religious community in general. It was at this point that there was a clear shift in the nature of the research. Instead of being concerned with factors such as church attendance and the quantity of religious involvement, researchers were now interested in the quality of religious involvement. As Whitley and Kite said, "These ideas evolved into the concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic religious orientation." (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010) &lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring==

[[Gordon Allport|Allport]] &amp; Ross developed a means of measuring  religious orientation. The Extrinsic measures extrinsic religious orientation (1967).&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W., &amp; Ross, J. M. (1967). Personal religious orientation and prejudice. Journal of 	Personality and Social Psychology, 5, 432-443.&lt;/ref&gt; A sample statement from this scale would be “The church is most important as a place to formulate good social relationships” (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010). This scale brought forth a lot of interest in religious orientations and much research has been done over the years. But as more researchers began studying religious orientation, the more problems that arose with the Intrinsic and Extrinsic scales measuring what they were supposed to be measuring (Hunsberger &amp; Jacson, 2005).&lt;ref name=hunsberger&gt;Hunsberger, B., &amp; Jackson, L.

==Extrinsic==

Extrinsic Religious Orientation is a method of using religion to achieve non-religious goals, essentially viewing religion as a means to an end.&lt;ref name=batson&gt;{{cite book|last=Batson|first=Daniel|title=Religion and the Individual|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-506208-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by people who go to religious gatherings and claim certain religious ideologies to establish or maintain social networks while minimally adhering to the teachings of the religion. People high in external religious orientation are more likely to conform to social norms and demands rather than what the religion requires, and are often prone to twist religious beliefs to serve their own political goals. Gordon Allport stated that people high in external religious orientation use religion, “to provide security and solace, sociability and distraction, status and self-justification” (Allport &amp;Ross, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;434). (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010)&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prejudice===

Hunsberger &amp; Jackson did a review of studies on religious orientation that had taken place since 1990 (2005).&lt;ref name=hunsberger&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Links have been made between prejudice and religious orientation but there have been no agreement on the relationship with intolerance. This is because there are many targets of prejudice, such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and age. Hunsberger and Jackson have found support for the idea that the target of prejudice is important when looking at prejudice and religious orientation relationships. After careful analysis, they have found that extrinsic orientation is positively related to racial/ethnic and gay/lesbian intolerance. People who measure high in extrinsic religious orientation have a utilitarian approach and view religion as a meaningful source of social status. Having high extrinsic religious orientation means you conform to popular trends, such trends including prejudice. The validity of the religious orientation scales have proved debatable, thus relationships to prejudice have either supported or refuted Allport and Ross's theories (Hunsberger &amp; Jackson, 2005).&lt;ref name=hunsberger&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===

An example would be a politician who goes to church in order to gain votes.

==Intrinsic==

According to Whitley and Kite, a person with an Intrinsic Religious Orientation sincerely believes in their religion and all its teachings and attempt to live their lives as their religion preaches that they should (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010).&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This agrees with what Daniel Batson would say; that while a person with an extrinsic religious orientation sees religion as a means to an end, a person with an intrinsic orientation sees their religion as that end. To them their religion is, "An active directing force, not just a tool used to reach self-serving ends." &lt;ref name=batson&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Those with this orientation find their religion to be the most important aspect of their life and seek to contextualize other aspects of their life through their religion. 

===Prejudice===

Research has found that people who hold an intrinsic religious orientation sincerely believe in and follow the teachings of their religion. They live their religion, and as a result those, "with a strong internal orientation should be unprejudiced to the extent that their religions teach inter group tolerance." Studies have found that these people show either no correlation or a negative correlation for racial prejudice. On the other hand, these same people often show a positive correlation for prejudice against gays.&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This effect would be predicted, being that while most religions do not speak ill of other races (racism being due to upbringing rather than any Biblical foundation), they do tend to have little regard for homosexuals. {{Citation needed|reason=show evidence the Bible is not racist or tribalist|date=December 2017}}

While this research appears more favorable than the research that showed a correlation between religious activity and prejudice, some researchers are convinced that these people are merely showing what they believe to be a more socially acceptable bias.&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Batson tested this hypothesis by having participants in a study (a study the participants were led to believe was about watching and evaluating a movie) choose whether to sit in a theater with a white confederate, or a black one. There were two conditions in this study, an overt condition in which both theaters were showing the same movie and a covert condition in which each theater was showing a different movie. The researchers believed that a prejudiced person who was attempting to appear unprejudiced would sit with the black confederate when the movie selection was the same in order to appear unprejudiced, but would sit with the white confederate (participants were white) when their choice could be attributed to wanting to watch the different movie. The researchers found that 75% of intrinsically religious participants chose to sit with the black confederate in the overt condition, but only 46% choose to sit with the black confederate in the covert condition. While these results do show that intrinsically motivated people do want to appear racially unbiased, it also shows that they are not racially prejudiced in general. Contrary to the religious orientations theory, extrinsic religiosity was unrelated to prejudice in either condition.&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===

An example would be a person who truly believes in their religion and uses this belief to guide them in all other aspects of their life.

==Quest orientation==

A third religious orientation proposed by Batson is the quest orientation. People with this orientation treats their religion not as a means or an end, but a search for truth. As Batson said, "An individual who approaches religion in this way recognizes that he or she does not know, and probably never will know, the final truth about such matters. Still the questions are deemed important, and however tentative and subject to changes, answers are sought."&lt;ref name=batson&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Prejudice===

Intuitively, it is logical to assume that people who hold a quest orientation would be low in prejudice because by having this orientation they have already shown that they are open-minded and willing to change. This idea was tested alongside the intrinsic and extrinsic orientations by Batson in his theater experiment (described above in the "Intrinsic Religious Orientation and Prejudice" section). People who scored high in quest orientation choose to sit with the black confederate about half the time in both the overt and covert conditions, indicating both a lack of prejudice and a lack of the attempt to appear unprejudiced. To summarize Whitley and Kite as well as Batson, quest orientation appears to be the source of "universal love and compassion" that has long been sought by both religious scholars and researchers interested in the psychology of religion.&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=batson&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===

Examples of people who have attained a quest orientation are [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Malcolm X]], and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]].&lt;ref name=batson&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="836">The '''School-Centred Initial Teacher Training''' ('''SCITT''') programme is a [[teacher]]-training course in [[England]].

The SCITT enables graduates to undertake their training within a school environment, leading to [[Qualified Teacher Status]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucas.com/ucas/teacher-training: ''UCAS Teacher Training'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some SCITT programmes also award a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education]] (PGCE) qualification.

The programmes cover primary, middle and secondary age ranges and candidates work in a consortium of schools within a designated region.

The entrance requirements and funding availability is the same as for PGCE courses and applications are also made through the UCAS, where applications can be monitored using UCAS 'Track'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2776">In [[3D computer graphics|realtime computer graphics]], a '''texture atlas''' (also called a '''sprite sheet''' or an '''image sprite''') is an image containing a collection of smaller images, usually packed together to reduce the atlas size.&lt;ref name="nvidia"&gt;{{cite web |title=SDK White Paper Improve Batching Using Texture Atlases |url=http://download.nvidia.com/developer/NVTextureSuite/Atlas_Tools/Texture_Atlas_Whitepaper.pdf |publisher=Nvidia |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlases can consist of uniformly-sized sub-images, or they can consist of images of varying dimensions.&lt;ref name="nvidia" /&gt; A sub-image is drawn using custom [[texture coordinates]] to pick it out of the atlas. In an application where many small [[texture (computer graphics)|textures]] are used frequently, it is often more efficient to store the textures in a texture atlas which is treated as a single unit by the [[Graphics processing unit|graphics hardware]].  Storing textures in an atlas reduces the overhead of a context switch by increasing [[memory locality]]. Careful alignment may be needed to avoid bleeding between sub textures when used with [[mipmapping]] and [[texture compression]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13221">'''Texture synthesis''' is the process of [[algorithm]]ically constructing a large [[digital image]] from a small digital sample image by taking advantage of its structural content. It is an object of research in [[computer graphics]] and is used in many fields, amongst others [[digital image editing]], [[3D computer graphics]] and [[Film#Production|post-production of films]].

Texture synthesis can be used to fill in holes in images (as in [[inpainting]]), create large non-repetitive background images and expand small pictures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1281500&amp;picked=prox&amp;cfid=933979594&amp;cftoken=11326769 "SIGGRAPH 2007 course on Example-based Texture Synthesis"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrast with procedural textures==

[[Procedural texture]]s are a related technique which may synthesise textures from scratch with no source material. By contrast, texture synthesis refers to techniques where some source image is being matched or extended.

==Textures==
"[[Texture (computer graphics)|Texture]]" is an ambiguous word and in the context of texture synthesis may have one of the following meanings:
# In common speech, the word "texture" is used as a synonym for "surface structure". Texture has been described by five different properties in the [[perception (psychology)|psychology of perception]]: ''coarseness'', ''contrast'', ''directionality'', ''line-likeness'' and ''roughness'' {{Ref|Tamura}}.
# In [[3D computer graphics]], a texture is a digital image applied to the surface of a three-dimensional model by [[texture mapping]] to give the model a more realistic appearance. Often, the image is a photograph of a "real" texture, such as [[wood grain]].
# In [[image processing]], every digital image composed of repeated elements is called a "texture."

[[Image:Texture spectrum.jpg|thumb|500px|A mix of photographs and generated images, illustrating the texture spectrum]]
Texture can be arranged along a spectrum going from regular to stochastic, connected by a smooth transition:&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/nrt/ "Near-regular Texture Analysis and Manipulation." Yanxi Liu, Wen-Chieh Lin, and James Hays. SIGGRAPH 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Regular textures.''' These textures look like somewhat regular patterns. An example of a structured texture is a stonewall or a floor tiled with paving stones.
* '''Stochastic textures.''' Texture images of stochastic textures look like [[noise#video noise|noise]]: colour dots that are randomly scattered over the image, barely specified by the attributes minimum and maximum brightness and average colour. Many textures look like stochastic textures when viewed from a distance. An example of a stochastic texture is [[roughcast]].
{{-}}

==Goal==
Texture synthesis algorithms are intended to create an ''output image'' that meets the following requirements:
* The output should have the size given by the user.
* The output should be as similar as possible to the sample.
* The output should not have visible artifacts such as seams, blocks and misfitting edges.
* The output should not repeat, i. e. the same structures in the output image should not appear multiple places.
Like most algorithms, texture synthesis should be efficient in computation time and in memory use.

==Methods==
The following methods and algorithms have been researched or developed for texture synthesis:

===Tiling===
The simplest way to generate a large image from a sample image is to [[Repeating texture|tile]] it. This means multiple copies of the sample are simply copied and pasted side by side.  The result is rarely satisfactory.  Except in rare cases, there will be the seams in between the tiles and the image will be highly repetitive.

===Stochastic texture synthesis===
Stochastic texture synthesis methods produce an image by randomly choosing colour values for each pixel, only influenced by basic parameters like minimum brightness, average colour or maximum contrast. These algorithms perform well with stochastic textures only, otherwise they produce completely unsatisfactory results as they ignore any kind of structure within the sample image.

===Single purpose structured texture synthesis===
Algorithms of that family use a fixed procedure to create an output image, i. e. they are limited to a single kind of structured texture. Thus, these algorithms can both only be applied to structured textures and only to textures with a very similar structure. For example, a single purpose algorithm could produce high quality texture images of stonewalls; yet, it is very unlikely that the algorithm will produce any viable output if given a sample image that shows pebbles.

===Chaos mosaic===
This method, proposed by the Microsoft group for internet graphics, is a refined version of tiling and performs the following three steps:
# The output image is filled completely by tiling. The result is a repetitive image with visible seams.
# Randomly selected parts of random size of the sample are copied and pasted randomly onto the output image. The result is a rather non-repetitive image with visible seams.
# The output image is filtered to smooth edges.
The result is an acceptable texture image, which is not too repetitive and does not contain too many artifacts. Still, this method is unsatisfactory because the smoothing in step 3 makes the output image look blurred.

=== Pixel-based texture synthesis ===

These methods, using Markov fields,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texturesynthesis.com/nonparaMRF.htm "Texture synthesis via a noncausal nonparametric multiscale Markov random field." Paget and Longstaff, IEEE Trans. on Image Processing, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; non-parametric sampling,&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/people/efros/research/EfrosLeung.html "Texture Synthesis by Non-parametric Sampling." Efros and Leung, ICCV, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; tree-structured vector quantization&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/texture-synthesis-sig00/ "Fast Texture Synthesis using Tree-structured Vector Quantization" Wei and Levoy SIGGRAPH 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; and image analogies&lt;ref&gt;[http://mrl.nyu.edu/projects/image-analogies/ "Image Analogies" Hertzmann et al. SIGGRAPH 2001.]&lt;/ref&gt; are some of the simplest and most successful general texture synthesis algorithms.  They typically synthesize a texture in scan-line order by finding and copying pixels with the most similar local neighborhood as the synthetic texture.  These methods are very useful for image completion.  They can be constrained, as in [[Image analogy|image analogies]], to perform many interesting tasks.  They are typically accelerated with some form of Approximate Nearest Neighbor method since the exhaustive search for the best pixel is somewhat slow.  The synthesis can also be performed in multiresolution, such as through use of a noncausal nonparametric multiscale Markov random field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texturesynthesis.com/nonparaMRF.htm "Texture synthesis via a noncausal nonparametric multiscale Markov random field." Paget and Longstaff, IEEE Trans. on Image Processing, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Imagequilting.gif|thumb|Image quilting.]]

=== Patch-based texture synthesis ===

Patch-based texture synthesis creates a new texture by copying and stitching together textures at various offsets, similar to the use of the [[clone tool]] to manually synthesize a texture. [[Image quilting]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/people/efros/research/quilting.html "Image Quilting." Efros and Freeman.  SIGGRAPH 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; and graphcut textures&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-static.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/perception//projects/graphcuttextures/  "Graphcut Textures: Image and Video Synthesis Using Graph Cuts." Kwatra et al. SIGGRAPH 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; are the best known patch-based texture synthesis algorithms.  These algorithms tend to be more effective and faster than pixel-based texture synthesis methods.

=== Deep Learning and Neural Network Approaches ===
More  recently,  [[deep learning]]  methods  were  shown  to  be a  powerful,  fast  and  data-driven,  parametric  approach  to texture  synthesis.   The  work  of  Leon Gatys&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Gatys|first=Leon A.|last2=Ecker|first2=Alexander S.|last3=Bethge|first3=Matthias|date=2015-05-27|title=Texture Synthesis Using Convolutional Neural Networks|eprint=1505.07376|class=cs.CV}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a  milestone: he and his co-authors  showed  that  filters  from  a  discriminatively trained deep neural network can be used as effective parametric  image  descriptors, leading to a novel texture synthesis method.

Another recent development is the use of generative models for texture synthesis. The Spatial  GAN&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Jetchev|first=Nikolay|last2=Bergmann|first2=Urs|last3=Vollgraf|first3=Roland|date=2016-11-24|title=Texture Synthesis with Spatial Generative Adversarial Networks|eprint=1611.08207|class=cs.CV}}&lt;/ref&gt;  method showed  for the first time the use of fully unsupervised [[Generative adversarial network|GANs]] for texture synthesis. In a subsequent work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Bergmann|first=Urs|last2=Jetchev|first2=Nikolay|last3=Vollgraf|first3=Roland|date=2017-05-18|title=Learning Texture Manifolds with the Periodic Spatial GAN|eprint=1705.06566|class=cs.CV}}&lt;/ref&gt; the method was extended further—PSGAN can learn both periodic and non-periodic images in an unsupervised way from single images or large datasets of images. In  addition, flexible sampling in the noise space allows to create novel textures of potentially infinite output size, and smoothly transition between them. This makes PSGAN unique with  respect  to  the  types  of  images  a  texture synthesis method can create.

==Implementations==
Some texture synthesis implementations exist as [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] for the free image editor [[GIMP|Gimp]]:

==Literature==
Several of the earliest and most referenced papers in this field include:
* [http://xenia.media.mit.edu/~popat/personal/ Popat] in 1993 - "Novel cluster-based probability model for texture synthesis, classification, and compression".
* [http://www.cns.nyu.edu/heegerlab/index.php?page=publications&amp;id=heeger-siggraph95 Heeger-Bergen] in 1995 - "Pyramid based texture analysis/synthesis".
* [http://www.texturesynthesis.com/papers/Paget_IP_1998.pdf Paget-Longstaff] in 1998 - "Texture synthesis via a noncausal nonparametric multiscale Markov random field"
* [http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/people/efros/research/NPS/efros-iccv99.pdf Efros-Leung] in 1999 - "Texture Synthesis by Non-parametric Sampling".
* [http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/texture-synthesis-sig00/ Wei-Levoy] in 2000 - "Fast Texture Synthesis using Tree-structured Vector Quantization"

although there was also earlier work on the subject, such as
* Gagalowicz and Song De Ma in 1986, "Model driven synthesis of natural textures for 3-D scenes",
* Lewis in 1984, "Texture synthesis for digital painting".
(The latter algorithm has some similarities to the Chaos Mosaic approach).

The non-parametric sampling approach of Efros-Leung is the first approach that can easily synthesis most types of texture, and it has inspired literally hundreds of follow-on papers in computer graphics.  Since then, the field of texture synthesis has rapidly expanded with the introduction of 3D graphics accelerator cards for personal computers.  It turns out, however, that [[Scott Draves]] first published the patch-based version of this technique along with GPL code in 1993 according to [http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/people/efros/research/synthesis.html Efros].

'''Zerovalent iron''' and other [[valence (chemistry)#Common valences|zerovalent]] metals (ZVI and ZVM, respectively) have a variety of applications ranging from [[filtration|filters]] to [[electrode]]s to [[trench]]es. One of the emerging uses for ZVI is iron wall [[Groundwater remediation|remediation]]. This technology uses ZVIs to form a [[permeable reactive barrier]] (PRB) which filters out contaminants in [[groundwater]], leaving only decontaminated groundwater and dissolved iron on the other side of the PRB.{{TOC left}}

==History==
The development of granular iron PRB technology was reliant on two advances: that metallic irons breaks down chlorinated organic compounds, and that reactions can proceed ''in situ'' under normal [[groundwater]] conditions.&lt;ref name="Gillham 537"&gt;Gillham, Robert, John Vogan, Lai Gui, Michael Duchene, and Jennifer Son. "Iron Barrier Walls for Chlorinated Solvent Remediation." &lt;ins&gt;''In Situ'' Remediation of Chlorinated Solvent Plumes&lt;/ins&gt;. Ed. Hans F. Stroo and C. Herb Ward. New York, NY: Springer Science+Business Media, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Metals have been used as [[catalyst]]s since the 20th century, with more literature available concerning the corrosion of metal shipping and storage containers.&lt;ref name="Gillham 537"/&gt; Because this literature concerned pure solvents rather than [[aqueous]] solutions and the processes often occurred at high temperatures and pressures, it was not looked at by the environmental community.&lt;ref name="Gillham 537"/&gt; In 1972, zerovalent metals were found to be effective in breaking down pesticides and other chlorinated organic compounds in aqueous solution.&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;Reynolds GW, Hoff JT, Gillham R W. 1990. Sampling bias caused by materials used to monitor halocarbons in groundwater. Environ Sci Technol 24:135--142&lt;/ref&gt; However, this finding was also overlooked, perhaps because it was only recorded in patents and it preceded awareness of chlorinated solvents in groundwater as an environmental problem.&lt;ref name="Gillham 537"/&gt;

In the 1980s, a student at the [[University of Waterloo]] examined the possibility of sample bias caused by [[sorption]] of contaminants to well casings and other materials used in groundwater sampling.&lt;ref name="Gillham 537"/&gt; While contaminants were lost from solution as a result of [[diffusion]] into [[polymer]]s, contaminant losses were also observed when solutions came into contact with certain metals, and these losses were not consistent with a [[diffusion]] process.&lt;ref name="Gillham 537"/&gt; [[redox|Reductive]] dechlorination was considered the most likely cause.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; This was confirmed by tests that showed several [[transitional metals]] had the ability to degrade many chlorinated [[aliphatic compound]]s.&lt;ref name="Gillham 537"/&gt;

==Background (theory)==
===Basic chemistry of iron corrosion===
The [[rust|corrosion]] reaction involving water is slow, whereas the corrosion of Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; with dissolved oxygen is fast, presuming there is O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; present. These are the reactive processes:
&lt;br /&gt;
[[:wikt:anaerobic|Anaerobic]] corrosion: Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Oxygen|Aerobic]] corrosion: 2Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The presence of a reducible contaminant can produce another reaction which can then contribute to the overall corrosion rate.&lt;ref name=Tratnyek2 /&gt;

===Pathways for contaminant reduction===

The zerovalent metal (usually granular iron) is the bulk reducing agent in these systems. However, corrosion of iron metal yields Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and hydrogen, both of which are possible reducing agents for contaminants such as chlorinated solvents. A [[heuristic]] model consisting of three possible mechanisms has proven very useful.

Pathway A represents direct electron transfer (ET) for Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to the adsorbed halocarbon (RX) at the metal/water point of contact, resulting in dechlorination and production of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Pathway B shows that Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (resulting from corrosion of Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) may also dechlorinate RX, producing Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. Pathway C shows that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the [[:wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] corrosion of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; might react with RX if a catalyst is present.

[[Hydrogenation]] also plays a minor role in most systems and iron surfaces will be covered with precipitates of oxides (or carbonates and sulfides) under most environmental conditions. Concern stemming from how the oxide layer mediates transfer of electrons from Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to adsorbed RX led to the formulation of another heuristic model, again consisting of three mechanisms.

In the second model, pathway I shows essentially direct ET from Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to RX in a corrosion pit, or similar defect in the oxide film. Pathway II shows the oxide film mediating ET from Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to RX by acting as a semiconductor. Pathway III shows the oxide film as a coordinating surface containing sites of Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; that complex and reduce RX.&lt;ref name=Tratnyek&gt;Tratnyek, Paul, and Rick Johnson. "Remediation with Iron Metal." Center for Groundwater Research. Oregon Health and Science University, 04 Feb. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sequestration====
Sequestration of a contaminant refers to a removal process which does not involve contaminant degradation. Sequestration by Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; typically occurs via [[adsorption]], [[redox|reduction]], and [[coprecipitation]]. Often, adsorption is only a prelude to other processes which do transform the contaminant in order to assure that the process cannot be reversed. However, there are cases where adsorption is the sequestration process of primary importance, especially with metals that occur as soluble [[cation]]s which cannot be reduced to insoluble forms by Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. It also can be true in heavy metals, such as [[cadmium|Cd]], [[copper|Cu]], [[mercury (element)|Hg]], etc., which exist predominantly as soluble cations but could be reduced to insoluble species by Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Tratnyek2&gt;Tratnyek, P. G.; M. M. Scherer; T. J. Johnson; Matheson, L.J. (2003). Permeable reactive barriers of iron and other zerovalent metals. In: Tarr M. A. (ed.), Chemical Degradation Methods for Wastes and Pollutants; Environmental and Industrial Applications. Environmental Science and Pollution Control, Marcel Dekker, New York, pp 371-421. {{doi|10.1201/9780203912553.ch9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Degradation via oxidation====
{{Expand section|date=May 2011}}

==Type of Metal==
===Iron===
[[Cast iron]], consisting of scrap iron of construction grade, has been used as a reactive material for [[permeable reactive barrier]]s for [[groundwater remediation]]. Reactions are generally believed to occur on the Fe (oxide) surface; however, graphite inclusions have been shown can also serve as a reaction site for [[2,4-Dinitrotoluene]] (DNT)&lt;ref name=Jafarpour&gt;Jafarpour, B.; Imhoff, P. T.; Chiu. P.C. 2005. Quantification and modeling of 2,4-dinitrotoluene reduction with high-purity and cast iron. Journal of Contaminant Hydrology. 76(1-2): 87-107. {{doi|10.1016/j.jconhyd.2004.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High purity iron is another category that indicates commercial, granular iron for [[powder metallurgy]], etc.

===Zinc and other metals===
Zinc has showed much higher reactivity toward [[pentachlorophenol]] than iron. This indicates that zinc may be used as a replacement for ZVI in dechlorinating chlorinated phenols. Chlorinated phenols are sequentially dechlorinated and thus less chlorinated phenols have been identified as a reduction product.&lt;ref name=Kim&gt;Kim, Y. H.; Carraway, E. R. 2003. Dechlorination of chlorinated phenols by zerovalent zinc. Environmental Technology. 24(12): 1455-1463. {{doi|10.1080/09593330309385690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bimetallic combinations===
[[Polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs) are decontaminated using a treatment system including catalytic ZVM particles and an organic hydrogen donating solvent. The solvent includes water and an [[alcohol]]. The treatment system can contain a 2nd solvent, such as [[d-limonene]], [[toluene]], or [[hexane]]. The treatment system can contain a thickener, such as [[calcium stearate]] or [[starch]]. The treatment system can contain a stabilizer, such as [[glycerin]], [[mineral oil]], or [[vegetable oil]]. The catalyst consists of zerovalent metal particles, esp. [[magnesium]] or [[iron]], coated with a catalytic metal, such as [[palladium]], [[nickel]], or [[silver]]. The treatment system provides a paste-like system that is preferably applied to natural media and ex-situ structures.&lt;ref name=Quinn&gt;Quinn, J. W., K. B. Brooks, C. L. Geiger, and C. A. Clausen. 2007. Bimetallic treatment system and its application for removal and remediation of polychlorinated biphenyls. WO. Patent No. 2007021640. United States of America as Represented by the Adm, 20060807.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nanoscale particles===
[[File:Iron Wall Types.png|thumb|205 px|click to enlarge]]
In addition to using "typical" scale iron in [[permeable reactive barrier|PRBs]], [[nanoparticles]] (1-100&amp;nbsp;nm diameter)  containing zerovalent iron (nZVI) may be used. There are uncertainties regarding the features of this technology which have made it difficult to engineer applications for optimal performance or to assess the risk to human or ecological health. However, several key facts have been identified related to nZVIs which, if ignored, may lead to misconceptions of the technology. These are as follows: 1) nZVIs used in [[groundwater remediation]] are larger than particles that exhibit "true" [[Nanoparticle#Properties|nano-size effects]] 2) the high reactivity of nZVI is mainly due to its high [[specific surface area]] and 3) the mobility of the nZVI particles will, in almost all relevant scenarios, be less than a few meters (one implication of this limited mobility is that human exposure due to [[groundwater remediation|remediation]] applications of nZVI is likely to be minimal). However, there are still many characteristics of this technology about which very little is known: e.g., how quickly nZVI will be transformed and to what products, whether this residue will be detectable in the environment, and how surface modifications of nZVI will alter its long-term environmental fate and effectiveness for remediation.&lt;ref name=Tratnyek/&gt;

The top-down approach for manufacturing [[nanoparticle|nano]]-ZVMs starts with a large metal particle (granular or microscale) and breaks it down. To do this, either mechanical or chemical means may be used which include but are not limited to milling, etching, and machining. On the other hand, the bottom up approach involves "growing" [[nanoparticle]]s via chemical synthesis, self-assembling, positional assembling, etc.&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;Li, X.; Elliot, D. W.; Zhang, W. 2006. Zerovalent iron nanoparticles for abatement of environmental pollutants: materials and engineering aspects. Critical Reviews in Solid State and Materials Sciences. 31(4): 111-122. {{doi|10.1080/10408430601057611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Type of contaminants treated==
===Metals===
[[Chromate]] is a significant component of many radioactive contaminant plumes. One removal technique involves the addition of scrap metal iron. The reactive surface of ZVI in [[alkaline]] waters is a [[ferrous]] coating such as green rust.&lt;ref name=Wander&gt;Wander, M. C. F.; Rosso, K.M.; Schoonen, M.A. 2006. Reduction of chromate by ferrous iron and green rust: A comparison of homogeneous vs. heterogeneous electron transfer rates. 232nd ACS National Meeting, San Francisco, CA. Abstracts of Papers, 232nd ACS National Meeting, COLL-509.&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[arsenic]], when selecting the reactive material of the PRB, one must consider the properties of the contaminant. In the case of treating arsenic-contaminated water, materials with a high potential for [[anion]] [[adsorption]] and [[coprecipitation]] are desirable. It is also beneficial to have a high potential to reduce the contaminant to an insoluble solid. For the removal of arsenic, the following is the chemical process involved:&lt;ref&gt;'''''This still needs to be cited, comes from the laminate-cover booklet called "Advances in PRBs for Groundwater Treatment"'''''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Iron(III) chloride|FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[water|3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] + [[Arsenic|[As]]] → [As][[Iron(III) hydroxide|Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[hydrogen ion|3H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] + [[chloride|Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]]

[[Technetium]], a radioactive material, is of great concern due to its long [[half-life]] and abundance in commercial nuclear waste. [[Technetium]] in lower valency states has a lower solubility and sorbs more strongly to soils than does [[technetium|Te]]&lt;sup&gt;7+&lt;/sup&gt;. ZVI has the potential to remove technetium in groundwater.&lt;ref name=Ding&gt;Ding, M.; Schroeder, N.C.; Reimus P.W. 2001. Zerovalent iron as a reducing "getter" for immobilization of technetium. 222nd ACS National Meeting, Chicago, IL. Abstracts of Papers, 222nd ACS National Meeting, Chicago, IL, United States, ENVR-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

To [[groundwater remediation|remediate]] groundwater contaminated by [[uranium]] a treatment has been developed to minimize the mobility of [[uranyl]] by transferring it to a stable phase. Because the exact mechanism of the decontamination process is unknown,  numerous forms of ZVI-materials have been synthesized, including carbon steel, low alloy steel, cast iron, and all other iron-containing alloys.&lt;ref name=Baghvand&gt;Baghvand, A. 2003. Immobilization of uranium in groundwater. Journal of Environmental Studies. 29(31): 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-metal inorganics ===
[[Chloramines]] pose a threat to aquatic ecosystems that are exposed to discharges of treated wastewater. Dechlorination with [[sulfite]] reduces the most refractory organic chloramines too slowly to produce wastewater effluents that meet current ecosystem protection criteria in the United States. The aqueous-phase reducing agents that offer speed advantages over sulfite alone include [[dithionite]], [[thiosulfate]], and iodide-mediated sulfite. Ascorbic acid was even more reactive but was found to be slow relative to sulfite. The potential biological oxygen demand might constrain the choice of aqueous reductants. Metallic iron is shown to reduce inorganic and organic chloramines effectively.&lt;ref name=Bedner&gt;Bedner, M.; W. A. MacCrehan; G. R. Helz. 2004. Making chlorine greener: investigation of alternatives to sulfite for dechlorination. Water Research. 38(10): 2505-2514. {{doi|10.1016/j.watres.2004.03.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapid [[nitrate]] reduction by iron powder is observed only at [[pH]]≤4. [[pH]] control with sulfuric acid prolongs nitrate reduction and increases the amount removed.&lt;ref name=Huang&gt;Huang, C.; Wang, H.; Chiu, P. 1998. Nitrate reduction by metallic iron. Water Research. 32(8): 2257-2264. {{doi|10.1016/S0043-1354(97)00464-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonia is the end product of nitrate reduction and accounts for all nitrate transformed under certain experimental conditions.&lt;ref name=Huang/&gt; However, by using nanoscale iron N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas is the product instead.&lt;ref name=Choe&gt;Choe, S.; Chang, Y.; Hwang, K.; Khim, J. 1999. Kinetics of reductive denitrification by nanoscale zerovalent iron. Chemosphere. 41(8): 1307-1311. {{doi|10.1016/S0045-6535(99)00506-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferrous]] species, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are probably not involved in the reaction.&lt;ref name=Huang/&gt;

===Organics===
Iron has been shown to be successful at dechlorinating pesticides such as [[DDT]], [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane|DDD]], and [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]]. The rates of dechlorination was independent of the amount of iron; however, the rates with a [[surfactant]] (Triton X-114) present were much higher. The rate of dechlorination is limited by the rate of dissolution into the aqueous phase.&lt;ref name="Sayles"&gt;Sayles, G. D.; You, G.; Wang, M.; Kupferle, M. J. 1997. DDT, DDD, and DDE dechlorination by zerovalent iron. Environmental Science &amp; Technology. 31(12): 3448-3454. {{doi|10.1021/es9701669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Viruses]] are especially problematic in the environment because they are more mobile and more resistant to chlorination and filtration than are bacteria. Removal of viruses from groundwater involve several different forms of iron, including Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[magnetite]]. Additionally, viruses can interact with iron in different ways, and thus can be deactivated to different extents.&lt;ref name=Zhang&gt;Zhang, L.; Chiu, P. C.; Jin, Y. 2006. Remediation and inactivation of viruses with elemental iron. 231st ACS National Meeting, American Chemical Society, Division of Environment. Atlanta, GA. Abstracts of Papers, 231st ACS National Meeting, ENVR-234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modes of application==
===Permeable reactive barriers===
{{Main|Permeable reactive barrier}}

===Soil mixing===
[[Permeable reactive barrier]]s can be less effective at greater depths due to construction matters, as most construction techniques involves excavation of the soil and replacing with reactive media. Soil mixing wall (SMW) technology, which is establishing cut-off walls and mixing cement slurries directly with soils under the ground, has become a new technology in soil remediation.&lt;ref name=Ito&gt;Ito, H., S. Hino, K. Okunishi, Y. Kinryu, and N. Hamamoto. 2004. Trial for constructing PRBS as application of soil mixing wall. International Conference on Remediation of Chlorinated and Recalcitrant Compounds, 4th, Monterey, CA. Proceedings of the International Conference on Remediation of Chlorinated and Recalcitrant Compounds, 4th, Monterey, CA, United States, May 24–27, 2004, 3A 04/1-3A 04/8.&lt;/ref&gt;
