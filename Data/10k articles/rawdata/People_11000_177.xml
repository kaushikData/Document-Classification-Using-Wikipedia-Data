'''Adam John Morrison''' (born July 19, 1984) is a retired American professional [[basketball]] player. Morrison played for three years at [[Gonzaga University]] and was considered to be one of the top [[college basketball]] players in 2005–06. He was a finalist for the [[Naismith College Player of the Year|Naismith]] and the [[Wooden Award]]. He was named [[Oscar Robertson Trophy|Co-Player of the Year]] with Duke's [[J. J. Redick]] by the [[United States Basketball Writers Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=2390779|title=Redick, Morrison named co-players of year|date=31 March 2006|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won the 2006 Chevrolet Player of the Year award.

==Early life==
Morrison's father, John, worked as a basketball coach, and the family moved with his coaching career: [[Casper College]] in [[Casper, Wyoming|Northwest Casper, Wyoming]], [[Dakota Wesleyan University]] in [[Mitchell, South Dakota]], and [[Dawson Community College]] in [[Glendive, Montana]]. When Morrison was in the fourth grade, his father left coaching,&lt;ref name=bravehearts150&gt;{{cite book |last= Withers |first=Bud |title=BraveHearts: The Against-All-Odds Rise of Gonzaga Basketball |year=2002 |publisher=Triumph Books |location=Chicago |isbn=1-57243-499-6 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the family moved to [[Spokane, Washington]]. Adam became the Gonzaga men's team's [[ball boy]].&lt;ref name=bravehearts150/&gt;

When he was in the eighth grade, he lost 30 pounds (14&amp;nbsp;kg),&lt;ref name="Duel"&gt;Grant Wahl, "Jewel of a Duel", ''Sports Illustrated'', February 28, 2006. (Available online only to ''SI'' subscribers.)&lt;/ref&gt; and while attending a basketball camp at Gonzaga during this time, he felt sick, later saying about his experience at the camp, "I think I made one shot the whole three days. I was sicker than a dog. I didn't want to play. I couldn't do anything."&lt;ref name=bravehearts150/&gt; Shortly after this, Morrison was diagnosed with [[diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]]. He took his diagnosis surprisingly well; the second time a nurse came to administer [[insulin]], he stopped her, telling her, "Since I'm going to be doing this the rest of my life, you might as well show me how to do it."&lt;ref name=bravehearts150/&gt; However, his illness did not keep him from becoming a star at [[Mead Senior High School]] in Spokane. In his senior year he broke single-season and career scoring records in his high school conference, and led Mead to the finals of the state tournament. Despite playing in the final game with [[hypoglycemia]] so severe that he nearly suffered a seizure, he scored 37 points in a losing effort. It was Mead's only loss that season. Morrison was not heavily recruited out of high school. Dave Telep of [[scout.com]] admitted, "In one of the biggest misses of my career, we left him off the Top 100 list. We ranked him the No. 26 small forward. The goal is to never make a mistake of that magnitude again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scouthoops.scout.com/2/843856.html|title=Scout Six Pack: Reappraising 2003|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==
Morrison arrived at [[Gonzaga University]] to play for the [[Gonzaga Bulldogs]] in 2003. In his freshman year he averaged 11.4 points per game (ppg), with a season-high 22 points against [[Saint Mary's College of California|St. Mary's]]. Gonzaga won the [[West Coast Conference]] (WCC) regular-season title. Morrison was named to the WCC All-[[Freshman]] Team.&lt;ref name=gozags&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gozags.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/morrison_adam00.html|title=GoZags.com Adam Morrison Bio – Gonzaga University  Official Athletic Site  Gonzaga University  Official Athletic Site – Men's Basketball|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his sophomore year Morrison averaged 19.0 ppg. He scored a season-high 28 points at home against [[University of San Francisco|San Francisco]], including the winning shot with 0.6 seconds to play in the game. Gonzaga again won the WCC regular-season title. Morrison made the All-WCC First Team and was selected to the ''[[Basketball Times]]'' All-West Coast Team as well as being named an honorable mention [[Associated Press]] All-American.&lt;ref name=gozags/&gt;

In his junior year during Gonzaga's first two games of the 2005–06 season at the [[Maui Invitational]], Morrison played well against two of the sport's top programs. In the first round, Morrison scored 25 points in a Gonzaga win over [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland]]. He followed up this performance with 43 points in a triple-overtime win over [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]] in the semifinals. He matched that output against in-state rival [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|Washington]] on December 4, 2005, in a losing effort. However, Morrison and the Zags bounced back a week later, defeating [[Oklahoma State University–Stillwater|Oklahoma State]] after he banked in a three-pointer with 2.5 seconds left to give Gonzaga a two-point lead and eventually the win.

In the regular season, he had 13 games of 30-plus points, with five of them over 40. At 28.1 points per game, he was the nation's leading scorer in 2005–2006. His scoring totals against teams in the "major" conferences were no less impressive; he averaged 28.5 points in 11 such games. On February 18, Morrison recorded a career high 44 points (including 37 in the second half alone) against the [[Loyola Marymount|Loyola Marymount Lions]] in a winning effort.

Morrison led the Zags with 24 points in a [[2006 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2006 NCAA Tournament]] Sweet Sixteen match against [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], which the Zags lost in the final seconds after UCLA had eliminated a 17-point deficit coming out of the first half. With seconds left, the lead having slipped away, Morrison broke down in tears and collapsed to the court. He was eventually helped to his feet by UCLA player [[Arron Afflalo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=18&amp;entry_id=3790 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=C.W. Nevius Blog : The Big Weep — Adam Morrison cries, America squirms | date=March 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been both criticized and praised for this unbridled show of emotion. He later shared the national player of the year award with friendly rival [[J. J. Redick]] of [[Duke University|Duke]]. The game against UCLA turned out to be Morrison's final collegiate game, as he later decided to turn pro, foregoing his senior year of college.

==Professional career==

===Charlotte Bobcats===
Adam John Morrison was selected 3rd overall pick in the [[2006 NBA draft]] by the [[Charlotte Bobcats]], behind [[Andrea Bargnani]] ([[Toronto Raptors]]) and [[LaMarcus Aldridge]] ([[Chicago Bulls]]). On July 6, 2006, the Bobcats signed Morrison to a two-year contract. On November 1, 2006, in his NBA debut against the [[Indiana Pacers]] he scored 14 points, with 3 rebounds and 2 assists. He was the first player picked by Manager of Basketball Operations [[Michael Jordan]] in his tenure with the Bobcats. He scored his career high on December 30, 2006, with 30 points in a win against the [[Indiana Pacers]]. However, Morrison lost his starting spot midway through the season, in part for his defense and shooting only 37% for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoopshype.com/players/adam_morrison.htm |title=NBA Players – Adam Morrison |publisher=HoopsHype |date= |accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2007, the Charlotte Bobcats announced that Morrison had sustained a severe injury to his left knee in a pre-season exhibition game against the [[L.A. Lakers]] while defending [[Luke Walton]], bending his knee laterally and falling to the ground in pain. An [[MRI]] scan performed after the game indicated a torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3073563|title=Cats' Morrison likely out for year with knee injury|date=22 October 2007|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/bobcats/morrison_tears_acl.html BOBCATS: Adam Morrison Tears ACL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307043745/http://www.nba.com/bobcats/morrison_tears_acl.html |date=March 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 10 Morrison underwent surgery to repair the damage. The injury was confirmed to be a torn ACL, requiring several months of [[physical therapy]] after the knee had healed, meaning he missed the whole 2007–08 NBA season.

===Los Angeles Lakers===
On February 7, 2009, Morrison and [[Shannon Brown]] were traded to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] for [[Vladimir Radmanović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lakers acquire adam morrison and shannon brown in exchange for vladimir radmanovic | url = http://www.nba.com/lakers/news/090207acquiremorrisonbrown.html | work = [[NBA.com]] | date = 2009-02-07 | accessdate = 2009-02-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090210121619/http://www.nba.com/lakers/news/090207acquiremorrisonbrown.html| archivedate= 10 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison won two NBA championships with the Lakers in 2009 and 2010, but saw very limited playing time. He was released following the 2009–10 season.

===Washington Wizards===
Morrison later signed with the [[Washington Wizards]], but was waived at the end of training camp.

===Red Star Belgrade===
In September 2011, Morrison signed with [[KK Crvena zvezda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/215561/Morrison_Signs_One_Year_Deal_With_Red_Star_Belgrade|title=Morrison Signs One-Year Deal With Red Star Belgrade – RealGM Wiretap|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released from his contract in November 2011 to pursue other opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Amick |first=Sam |date=November 29, 2011 |title=Morrison let out of Serbian deal, may join NBA free-agent class |work=SI.com |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/sam_amick/11/29/morrison/index.html?eref=writers |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his 8 game stay in Belgrade (he missed one away match due to a minor injury problem), Morrison averaged 15.5 points, 3.1 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 29 minutes a game, becoming his team's top scorer and the second overall top performer during the [[2011–12 ABA League|2011–12]] [[Liga ABA|Adriatic League]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adriaticbasket.info/w2/club.php?id=18 |title=Morrison's Adriatic League statistics |publisher=Adriatic Basketball Association |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63eztA6R8?url=http://www.adriaticbasket.info/w2/club.php?id=18 |archivedate=December 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beşiktaş Milangaz===
In January 2012, Morrison signed with [[Beşiktaş men's basketball team|Beşiktaş Milangaz]] for the rest of the 2011–12 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{tr}}[http://www.ntvspor.net/haber/basketbol/56211/adam-morrison-besiktas-milangazda Adam Morrison Beşiktaş Milangaz'da]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he left the team in April 2012 due to a lack of playing time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportando.net/eng/europe/turkey/37518/adam-morrison-and-besiktas-officially-part-ways.html|title=Adam Morrison-Besiktas, coach Ataman conferma l'addio|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted return to the NBA===
After being absent from the NBA since being waived by the Wizards, Morrison played in the 2012 [[NBA Summer League]] for the [[Brooklyn Nets]] and averaged 5.2 points and 19.2 minutes in five games with the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/summer-league/2012/teams/nets/ |title=2012 NBA Summer League |publisher=NBA.com |date=2012-07-13 |accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then joined the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]' Summer League team, averaging 20.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 1.0 assists on 55% FG (38-69), 61% 3-PT (13-21) and 78% FT (11-14) in 5 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==National team career==
Morrison made four appearances for various junior U.S. national teams. Morrison was selected to train with the senior men's team in preparation for the 2006 [[FIBA World Championship]] but was cut prior to the tournament.&lt;ref name="FIBA cut"&gt;[http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fe/06_wcm/teamPlay/team/fe_teamPlay_teamRostNews.asp?lid_7012_newsID=14115&amp;lid_7012_langID=1&amp;eventID=3507&amp;roundID=3507&amp;langLC=en&amp;teamNumber=379&amp;competitionCode=&amp;season=&amp;playerNumber=&amp;zone= "Team USA announce 15-man squad"], ''[[2006 FIBA World Championship|FIBA2006.com]]'', July 26, 2006. Accessed 2006-08-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==
In July 2013, Gonzaga basketball coach [[Mark Few]] announced that Morrison would become a student assistant with the basketball team. Morrison had returned to Gonzaga to take classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adam Morrison joining Gonzaga staff|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/blog/eye-on-college-basketball/22890431/adam-morrison-joining-gonzaga-staff|date=2013-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his undergraduate degree at Gonzaga in 2014, majoring in sports management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gonzaga Student-Athletes Receive Undergraduate Degrees|url=http://www.gozags.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/051214aab.html|date=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison became an assistant video coordinator for the Bulldogs for the 2014–15 season, but was weighing options for his career after the season would come to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gonzaga notes: Adam Morrison weighing options|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/jan/14/gonzaga-notes-adam-morrison-weighing-options/|date=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adam Morrison had the perfect comeback to a Duke fan's taunt about 2006|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/03/adam-morrison-duke-fan|date=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Morrison lives near [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], with his girlfriend, two daughters, and a son. He claims not to be religious and does not believe in marriage.&lt;ref name=weitzman&gt;Weitzman, Yaron [http://thelab.bleacherreport.com/life-as-an-nba-draft-bust/ Life as an NBA Draft Bust: It’s better than you might think. Ask Adam Morrison.] ''Bleacher Report''. June 22, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diabetes===
Morrison was diagnosed with [[diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]] (insulin-dependent diabetes) at age 13. He was playing in an eighth-grade basketball game, and as the game went into overtime, he began having seizure-like symptoms, which prompted his father to take him to the hospital where the diagnosis was made. Morrison, who managed his [[diabetes]] to the point of eating exactly the same meals at the same time on game days, is considered a role model for children with the disease and their families. During his freshman year at Gonzaga, Morrison and his life with diabetes were a subject of a four-page article in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. On the first day that the issue appeared in retail outlets, more than fifty parents of children with diabetes contacted the Gonzaga athletics department asking if Morrison could speak to their children. Off the court, Morrison regulates his [[blood sugar]] with an [[insulin pump]] attached to his abdomen.&lt;ref name="bravehearts150" /&gt;

'''Al Parker''' (born '''Andrew Robert Okun'''; June 25, 1952 – August 17, 1992) was a [[gay]] [[United States of America|American]] [[pornographic actor|porn star]], [[film producer|producer]], and [[film director|director]]. He died from complications of [[AIDS]] at the age of 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edmonson|2000|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Parker was born in [[Natick, Massachusetts]].  After arriving in California, he was employed by [[Hugh Hefner]] at the [[Playboy Mansion|Playboy Mansion West]] as a butler.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edmonson|2000|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; His career in gay film started when he was "discovered" by [[Rip Colt]], founder of ''[[Colt Studios]]''. Colt gave him the performance name "Al Parker."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edmonson|2000|page=XVII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker began his filmmaking career when he signed with Brentwood Studios. He initially made short loop films shot on 8&amp;nbsp;mm reels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edmonson|2000|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surge Studios==
Parker was a [[Film producer|producer]], [[Film director|director]], and [[Porn actor|actor]]. His company, Surge Studios, produced "theme" gay adult features, not just short loops. Many of the films were shot out of Parker's home in [[Hermosa Beach, California]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Surge Studios was one of the first studios to mandate [[safe sex]] practices when AIDS appeared.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==Personal life==
In 1969, Parker's mother encouraged him to attend the [[Woodstock|Woodstock Music Festival]], believing that it was a classical music festival. After he was forced to abandon his mother's new car in the mud along the road leading to the festival, he encountered what he regarded as his first wholly satisfying sexual experience.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{harvnb|Edmonson|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; His picture was taken there and appears on the poster collage for the ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' concert film released in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edmonson|2000|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker was one of the interview subjects of Dr. Dean Edell, who reported a surgical procedure that sought to restore Parker's foreskin from his at-birth circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwkXCV4Vyw4 |title=Surgical Foreskin Restoration |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2009-02-03 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surgery was performed by Dr. Ira Sharlip, a urologist. The report was broadcast on television.

==Death==
Parker died in [[San Francisco]]. His remains were cremated and a memorial service was held at his private residence. His ashes were scattered in the ocean near the nude section of [[San Gregorio State Beach]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/17682027 |title=Al Parker (1952 - 1992) - Find A Grave Memorial |website=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Mateo County, California]].

==Legacy==
Parker is the subject of Roger Edmonson's biography ''Clone: The Life and Legacy of Al Parker Gay Superstar''.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

Parker's life is depicted in [[playwright]] Drew Sachs' play, ''aka Al Parker''.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/villageplaywrights/home/archive-of-readings |title=Archive of readings - villageplaywrights |website=Sites.google.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/casting/aka-al-parker-69435/al-parker-269216/ |title='A.K.A.

'''Barnaby Ruhe''' is an American artist, [[shaman]], academic, and six-time world champion [[boomerang|boomerang throw]]er. As an artist, Ruhe, a professor at [[New York University]]'s [[Gallatin school of individualized study]], is best known for his painting marathons, otherwise known as endurance feats&lt;!--, whereby his constant kinetic energy is dispersed in order for him to facilitate likenesses of some or many of that particular event's guests--&gt;.&lt;ref name="The Morning Call"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2011-06-18/entertainment/mc-barnaby-ruhe-20110618_1_barnaby-ruhe-irs-fluxus|accessdate=21 February 2012|title=It's a happening, with artist/teacher Barnaby Ruhe}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[New York City]] studio is located within the [[Westbeth Artists Community]].

Ruhe obtained his B.S. from the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] in 1968, his M.F.A. from the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]]  in 1975  and his PHD from [[New York University]] in 1989.

Ruhe received his doctorate in shamanism and art practice, an interdisciplinary effort combining psychology, anthropology, art history, phenomenology and art studio action. He was senior editor of ''Art/World'' newspaper in the 1980s and '90s and wrote the first New York City reviews of work by [[Francesco Clemente]] and [[Doug and Mike Starn|The Starn Twins]], as well as essays on [[Francisco de Goya]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Joseph Beuys]]. Ruhe currently serves on the board of Artists Talk on Art. A romantic artist, he incorporates sentiment, gesture and psychic journeying into his paintings, and he runs shaman healing workshops at Shamandome Camp at the [[Burning Man]] festival each summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gallatin.nyu.edu/people/faculty/br18.html|title=Barnaby Ruhe|last=|first=|date=|website=gallatin.nyu.edu|publisher=NYU|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Alexander Steedman Ruhe however describes himself as being more of a [[bodhisattva]] than a shaman in life practice in remarking ... "I am not a Shaman. I am a Bodhisattva.”,,, “a person brought on life to entertain the souls of all the other people out of love and sheer delight" ...&lt;ref&gt;https://nyulocal.com/a-conversation-with-professor-barnaby-ruhe-gallatins-very-own-bodhisattva-e9be35c87836&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruhe is also well known for his yearly recreation of the persona of an artist in the [[NYC Halloween Parade]].  He has taken on the role of such artists as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Vincent Van Gogh]], [[Hieronymus Bosch]], and [[Michelangelo]], all executed while painting in tandem with moving down the avenue during the celebration.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/meet-the-most-die-hard-village-halloween-parade-marchers&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruhe also appeared on the television program "[[That's Incredible]]" demonstrating his "[[William Tell]]" trick which consists of splitting an apple on his own head with a self-propelled boomerang.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/02/nyregion/stroboscopic-photos-informed-paintings.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://dagmarmarketing.com/blog/conversion-optimization-boomerang-champions-teach-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruhe's work was the subject of a solo exhibition "Regenesis" at the [[Baum School of Art]] in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]] which ran from September 20 until October 20, 2018.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8429">'''Bolesław the Forgotten''' ({{Lang-pl|Bolesław Zapomniany}}) or '''the Cruel''' ({{lang|pl|Bolesław Okrutny}}; before 1016 &amp;ndash; 1038/39) was a semi-legendary [[Duke]] of [[Poland]] of the [[Piast dynasty]] from 1034 until his death in 1038 or 1039. He was allegedly the first-born son of [[Mieszko II Lambert]].

==Sources which mention his existence==
He is described in the ''[[Wielkopolska Chronicle]]'', written in the 14th century, where he is said to have taken power in Poland after the death of his father Mieszko II, as he was the eldest son. According to the chronicle he was killed because of his extreme cruelty, and sentenced to the ''[[Damnatio memoriae]]''. The Julian calendar was in use so [[New Year's Day]] had not been changed to the first day of January. The text describes him as follows:

{{cquote|When he [Mieszko II] died in the year of our Lord 1033, he was succeeded by his first-born son Bolesław. As soon as he was crowned king, he caused his mother many insults. His mother coming from an excellent family, unable to bear his iniquity, having taken her youngest son, Casimir, returned to her native land in Saxony, to Brunswick, and having placed there her son to be taught, she retired to some convent of nuns. Bolesław meanwhile, because of his severity and the horrors of his crimes, badly ended his life, and though he was awarded the crown royal, shall not be placed among the Polish kings and princes.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gdy umarł w roku Pańskim 1033, nastąpił po nim pierworodny syn jego Bolesław. Skoro ten został ukoronowany na króla, wyrządził swej matce wiele zniewag. Matka jego pochodząca ze znakomitego rodu, nie mogąc znieść jego niegodziwości, zabrawszy maleńkiego syna swego Kazimierza, wróciła do ziemi ojczystej w Saksonii, do Brunszwiku, i umieściwszy tam syna dla nauki miała wstąpić do jakiegoś klasztoru zakonnic. Bolesław zaś z powodu srogości i potworności występków, których się dopuszczał, źle zakończył życie i choć odznaczony został koroną królewską, nie wchodzi w poczet królów i książąt Polski.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, there is no mention of any coronation of a Polish ruler in this period, which would have to be recorded in the German sources (as was the case with the coronations of Bolesław I and Mieszko II), probably because there was no royal insignia in the country, which had been returned to the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] by the well-known [[Bezprym]] earlier in the year 1031.

This brief description of Bolesław in the ''Wielkopolska Chronicle'' is very similar with the information about Bezprym who was described in the ''Chronicles of Hildesheim'':

::''1032. This year Bezprym was killed by his own men, not without the instigation of his brothers, because of his cruelty and tyrannical rule''.

Bolesław's life is also described in a text written by Wincenty z Kielczy (13th century) and some other sources. In the ''Annals of Kraków'' under the date of 1038 was placed the information about a "king Bolesław's" death. This date cannot be connected with [[Bolesław I Chrobry]] (who died in 1025) and [[Bolesław II the Bold]] (dead in 1081, deposed and exiled) so it may refer to the Forgotten. In addition, an indirect reference to his existence may be found in the ''Małopolska Chronicle'', where [[Bolesław III Wrymouth]] is called Bolesław IV. Also, in the ''Tyniec Codec'' (destroyed in the 19th century), [[Bolesław II the Generous]] was given the Roman numeral III. This gives some grounds to believe that between [[Bolesław I Chrobry]] and Bolesław II could be placed another Bolesław.

Foreign chronicles also favored the existence of Bolesław the Forgotten, for example:

*The ''Chronicles of Braunweiler'', where is mentioned the persecution of Queen [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]], wife of Mieszko II by a "concubine" (Latin: ''pellex''): ''Queen Richeza, was divorced from her husband the King because of his hatred and the incitement of someone called concubine.'' No mention of any alleged son of this anonymous concubine, whose supporters of his existence identify with the Forgotten (which, however, introduced a contradiction with the reports of the ''Wielkopolska Chronicle'', where he was mentioned as the first-born son of Mieszko II and Richeza).
*The ''Chronica Boemorum'' of [[Cosmas of Prague]]: ''In the year of the Incarnation of the Lord 1037 died the Duke Bolesław, which Mieszko was deprived of sight''. However, historians who refuted the existence of the Forgotten alluded that this Duke could be [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslaus III of Bohemia]], who was imprisoned and blinded by orders of Bolesław I (and the mention of Mieszko could be a mistake of the chronicler).
*The Hungarian chronicle of Bishop Chartiritusa (first half of the 13th century) mentions the help given for Bolesław II to Hungary: ''Henry won and the King of Alba and Kaulem relented, and having taken the three princes Levecnte, Bela and Peter escaped to Poland at the side of their widowed grandmother Duchess Dąbrówka, who had already raised his eighteen-year-old grandson Bolesław as a young adult, gallant and fierce in battle''. However, this text contains several errors (for example, a non-existent Dąbrówka is identified as the grandmother of the Hungarian princes), and in consequence its value is questionable.

==In Polish historiography==
In older times Bolesław was widely described as historical monarch of Poland. Many Polish historians were sure about his existence: [[Tadeusz Wojciechowski]], [[Oswald Balzer]], [[Roman Grodecki]], [[Feliks Koneczny]], [[Stanisław Zakrzewski]], and [[Zygmunt Wojciechowski]]. They had the following arguments:

* [[Casimir I the Restorer]] was sent to monastery in Germany. Usually only the younger sons were sent to the monasteries, implying that Casimir had an older brother.
* Name ''Casimir'' had not been used earlier in the Piast dynasty. It would be natural to name the eldest son as ''Bolesław'', to honor Mieszko's father - [[Bolesław I Chrobry]].
* In the period 1034–1039 Casimir was living in Germany. It would have been impossible to leave the Polish state alone, without a monarch for such a long time.

Some say that [[Gallus Anonymus]] failed to describe Bolesław because of the ruler's part in the [[pagan reaction in Poland]].

'''Buffalo Bull's Back Fat''', or '''Stu-mick-o-súcks''' (in the [[Blackfoot language]]), was a head war chief of the [[Kainai Nation|Blood Indians]]. He is remembered today for his portrait, painted by [[George Catlin]] in 1832, located at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Stu-mick-o-súcks, Buffalo Bull's Back Fat, Head Chief, Blood Tribe by George Catlin

In one of his letters, Catlin wrote:

{{quote|I have this day been painting a portrait of the head chief of the [Blood tribe] … he is a good-looking and dignified Indian, about fifty years of age, and superbly dressed; whilst sitting for his picture he has been surrounded by his own braves and warriors and also gazed at by his enemies, the [[Crow Nation|Crows]] and the [[Cree|Knisteneaux]], [[Assiniboine|Assinneboin]]s and [[Ojibwe|Ojibbeway]]s; a number of distinguished personages of each of which tribes have laid all day around the sides of my room; reciting to each other the battles they have fought, and pointing to the scalp-locks, worn as proofs of their victories, and attached to the seams of their shirts and leggings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The name of this dignitary of whom I have just spoken is Stu-mick-o-sucks (the [[American bison|buffalo]]'s back fat), i.e., the ‘hump’ or ‘fleece’ the most delicious part of the buffalo's flesh. … The dress … of the chief … consists of a shirt or tunic, made of two deerskins finely dressed, and so placed together with the necks of the skins downwards, and the skins of the hind legs stitched together, the seams running down on each arm, from the neck to the knuckles of the hand; this seam is covered with a band of two inches in width, of very beautiful [[embroidery]] of [[porcupine]] [[Spine (zoology)|quills]], and suspended from the under edge of this, from the shoulders to the hands, is a fringe of the locks of black hair, which he has taken from the heads of victims slain by his own hand in battle. … In his hand he holds a very beautiful pipe, the stem of which is four or five feet long, and two inches wide, curiously wound with braids of the porcupine quills of various colours; and the bowl of the pipe ingeniously carved by himself from a piece of red [[Soapstone|steatite]] of an interesting character, and which they all tell me is procured somewhere between this place and the [[Saint Anthony Falls|Falls of St. Anthony]], on the head waters of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]].|author=George Catlin, ''Letters and Notes'', vol. 1, pp. 29–31&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Campfire Stories with George Catlin |url=http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/online/catlinclassroom/catlin_browsec.cfm?ID=16 |accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The painting appeared in the exhibit ''Pictures from the New World at Schloss Charlottenburg'', which was held in the Orangerie of [[Charlottenburg Palace]], Berlin, Germany, in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Kersten, Hans Ulrich.

Dr. '''Béla Király''' (14 April 1912 – 4 July 2009) was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]]  army officer before, during, and after [[World War II]].  After the war, he was sentenced to life in prison under the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-allied regime, but was later released.  After his release, he commanded the National Guard in the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]]. He then fled to the [[United States]], where he became an academic historian. He returned to Hungary after the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of the Soviet Bloc]] and was elected a member of [[Parliament of Hungary|Hungarian Parliament]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Kaposvár]], [[Hungary]], the son of a station master.  As a youth he bred [[pigeons]], a lifelong interest.  His ambition to be a veterinary surgeon foundered because his family could not afford the fees.  [[Color blindness]] barred his employment by the railroad.  In 1930, military service became compulsory - two years for conscripts but only one year for volunteers.  He joined the army, found it interesting, finished the Ludovika Military Academy in the top 5% of his class, and was [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] a second lieutenant 20 August 1935. As a student at the General Staff Academy he was promoted to [[Captain (land)|captain]] in December 1942.&lt;ref name=NYT_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hnet/&gt;

==World War II and postwar imprisonment==
Hungary joined the [[Axis powers]] and declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941. Király saw combat on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|eastern front]] and was twice wounded.  In 1943 he commanded 400 men guarding a Jewish [[Labour service (Hungary)|labor battalion]] in the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] valley. Contrary to orders, he provided them with warm clothing, decent food, and medical attention. In 1993, [[Yad Vashem]] named him one of the “[[Righteous Among the Nations]]”, recognizing his humane treatment of the Jewish prisoners.&lt;ref name=NYT_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=JTA_obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In March 1945 Király commanded the [[Kőszeg#World War II and the Holocaust|defense of Kőszeg]]. Upon surrendering the city to the [[Red Army]], he was arrested and sent to [[Siberia]] as a [[prisoner of war]]. He returned home following the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaties]], and joined the [[Hungarian Communist Party]] and the new [[Hungarian Defence Force#Warsaw Pact|Hungarian People's Army]].

Communist officials warned him against his 1947 marriage to the widowed niece of [[Far-right politics|far-right]] former prime minister [[Gyula Gömbös]], who was, for much of his career, [[Anti-Semitism|anti-semitic]]. He expected to be sacked when General [[György Pálffy]] summoned him, but instead was appointed to command the Training Department. He was promoted to general in 1950, and later to the rank of major general. In 1950, he was put in command of the [[infantry]]. He was expected to command the Hungarian component of a planned Soviet invasion of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] following the [[Tito–Stalin Split]]. [[Stalin]] ceased the operation, however, discouraged by the success of American intervention in the [[Korean War]]. According to Király, the situation in Korea "nipped Stalin's pet project in the bud".&lt;ref name=schindler/&gt;

In 1951, the [[Mátyás Rákosi]] regime arrested him on charges of subversion, sedition, and espionage. He was sentenced on January 15, 1952 to death by hanging. His wife was detained by the [[ÁVH]] from August 1951 until August 1953. She divorced him in 1955. He then learned that his sentence had been commuted to life imprisonment at hard labor. In September 1956 the government of [[Imre Nagy]] paroled him along with other prisoners, a measure intended to soften public unrest.&lt;ref name=NYT_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=JTA_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hnet/&gt;

==Role in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution==
The [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] began shortly after his release from prison. He was ill and recovering from surgery, but he escaped the hospital to join the Hungarian revolutionaries and accept appointment as commander-in-chief of the military guard and military commander of Budapest against the Soviets.

{{Quotation|“I was skin and bones coming out of five years of imprisonment,” Agence France-Presse quoted him as saying in 2006. “I was far from being healed, so I had to slip out of the hospital because the doctors would not let me go.”|Béla Király|Agence France-Presse 2006|&lt;ref name=NYT_obit/&gt;}}

Violence broke out in Budapest on October 23, 1956. Soviet troops, unprepared for the strength of the revolutionary forces, arranged a ceasefire on October 28, and began to retreat from the city. The violence subsisted, however, as pro-Nagy communists and various nationalist factions engineered purges of pro-Soviet party members in the city. Király, sensing a chaotic fragmentation of the revolutionary forces, sought to unite various anti-Soviet factions into a National Guard. On October 30, 1956, Király-led revolutionaries attacked the building of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. The revolutionaries detained dozens of suspected pro-Soviets, executing many on the spot. Similar purges continued throughout the city.&lt;ref name="berecz"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/1956Counter-revolutionInHungary | title=1956 Counter-Revolution in Hungary: Words and Weapons | publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó | author=Berecz, János | year=1986 | pages=116 | isbn=978-9630543705}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="filimonov"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.polit.ru/article/2006/10/30/mify_vengr/ | title=Мифы о восстании | publisher=Polit RU | date=October 30, 2016 | accessdate=October 27, 2016 | author=Filimonov, Olef}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the continued violence directed against pro-Soviet communists, Soviet correspondent [[Anastas Mikoyan]] advised against a Soviet invasion, wishing for the Hungarian communists to suppress the "counter-revolution" themselves. This inaction led many pro-Soviets to question their loyalties. As [[Nikita Khrushchev]] lost confidence in the ability of the Hungarian communists the suppress the uprising, he directed the Soviet army to invade Budapest on November 4.&lt;ref name="khrushchev"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://kiatipis.org/Writers/N/Nikita.Khrushchev/Memoirs-of-Nikita-Khrushchev[Vol3].pdf | title=Memoirs of Nikita Khrushchev | publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press | author=Khrushchev, Nikita  | year=2007 | location=University Park | pages=665 | isbn=978-0-271-02935-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Király recognized his forces, loyal to Nagy, had no hope of victory over the Soviet army. However, he resented Soviet ambassador [[Yuri Andropov]]'s concealing of the imminent invasion, which [[Nikita Khrushchev]] had officially decided upon 3 days prior.
{{Quotation|''Here was this man Andropov who clearly understood what was going on,'' Mr. Kiraly said bitterly, ''yet he pretended until the last moment to me and to the Prime Minister and to others that everything was business as usual. Even pirates, before they attack another ship, hoist a black flag. He was absolutely calculating.''|Béla Király|1982 interview with R.W. Apple, Jr.|&lt;ref name=Apple_1982/&gt;}}

After the Soviets successfully suppressed the revolution, Király fled to the United States through Austria to avoid capture. He was, however, sentenced to death ''[[in absentia]]'' back in the Soviet Union (a fate which other revolutionary leaders like Nagy did not escape).&lt;ref name=NYT_obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Time in the United States==
Király was well regarded in the United States, as the U.S. had been supportive of the Nagy-led government to which Király had been loyal. He arrived speaking good English, having taught himself through an English-Hungarian dictionary while in prison. He enrolled in [[Columbia University]] earned a graduate degree in history. From 1964 he taught Military History at [[Brooklyn College]], and became chairman of the history department. He retired as Professor Emeritus in 1982.&lt;ref name=NYT_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent_obit/&gt; During his tenure he served as director of the Society In Change Program on East Central Europe, supervised Brooklyn College Press (the College's Publishing House), and was an adviser to the Brooklyn College Military History Club. The Brooklyn College Bela K. Kiraly Award, awarded to undergraduate students for outstanding work in modern history, bears his name.

==Return to Hungary==
After the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of the Soviet Bloc]], he was an invited guest at [[Imre Nagy]]'s funeral and re-interment, June 1989. He moved back to Hungary later that year, and was elected to the [[Hungarian National Assembly]], representing his birthplace Kaposvár. He served from May&amp;ndash;November 1990 as an independent deputy, then joined the [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SZDSZ) parliamentary group,&lt;ref name=NYT_obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=JTA_obit/&gt; later assuming the role of a government adviser. In 2004, he was made an associate member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].

Király died in his sleep in [[Budapest]] on 4 July 2009, aged 97.&lt;ref name=JTA_obit/&gt;

==Education==
Wiley received his doctoral degree in biophysics in 1971 from [[Harvard University]], where he worked under the direction of the subsequent 1976 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|chemistry Nobel Prize]] winner [[William Lipscomb|William N. Lipscomb, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/01.10/08-wiley.html Harvard Gazette: Biologist Don C.

There, Wiley did early work on the structure of [[aspartate carbamoyltransferase]], the largest molecular structure determined at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sondra|first=Schlesinger|title=Oral history: Don Wiley|date=1999 |url=http://virologyhistory.wustl.edu/wiley.htm|work=Viruses: From structure to biology|publisher=American Society for Virology|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noteworthy in this effort was that Wiley managed to grow crystals of aspartate carbamoyltransferase suitable for obtaining its [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray structure]], a particularly difficult task in the case of this molecular complex.

==Career and research==
Wiley was world-renowned for finding new ways to help the human immune system battle such viral scourges as [[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[HIV/AIDS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Donald E. Pelotte''' [[Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament|SSS]] (April 13, 1945 – January 7, 2010) was the third [[Roman Catholic]] [[bishop]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Gallup|Diocese of Gallup]], [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=Cheney |url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bpelotte.html |title=Bishop Donald Edmond Pelotte |publisher=Catholic-hierarchy.org |date= |accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first person of Native American descent to become a Catholic bishop in the United States; Philadelphia Archbishop [[Charles J. Chaput]], [[O.F.M. Cap.]], is the only active American diocesan bishop of Native American descent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archden.org/index.cfm/ID/272/Archbishop's-Biography-/ Biography and Curriculum Vitae of Charles J.

Bishop Pelotte ordained Father Dana F. Pelotte, SSS, to the priesthood, on September 4, 1999 in their childhood parish of [[Waterville, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Brotherly+love.-a055881932| title=Brotherly love - Bishop Donald E. Pelotte ordains twin brother, Dana F. Pelotte | work=[[National Catholic Reporter]] | date=1999-09-17 | accessdate=2008-01-27 | publisher=The Gale Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Pelotte was born on April 13, 1945, in [[Waterville, Maine]], to Norris Albert Pelotte and Margaret Yvonne LaBrie Pelotte. His father was a member of the [[Abenaki]] [[First Nations]] [[tribe]] and his mother was of [[French-Canadian]] ([[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]]) descent. Donald and his twin brother Dana were the youngest of five brothers. He studied at Eymard Seminary in [[Hyde Park, New York|Hyde Park]], [[New York (state)|New York]] during his high school years. He did his college studies [[John Carroll University]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] and later completed doctoral studies at [[Fordham University]]. His doctoral dissertation was entitled: ''[[John Courtney Murray]], Theologian in Conflict: Roman Catholicism and the American Experience''. This was later published in book form by [[Paulist]] Press.&lt;ref name="Gallup bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dioceseofgallup.org/bishop/pelotte.html |title=Most Rev. Donald E. Pelotte |publisher=[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Gallup|Diocese of Gallup]] |accessdate=2008-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509122131/http://www.dioceseofgallup.org/bishop/pelotte.html |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 33, he became the [[Provincial Superior]] of the [[Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament]] and was the youngest major superior of a religious community of men in the United States at the time.  On February 24, 1986, he was named [[Coadjutor Bishop]] of Gallup and was consecrated on May 6, 1986. Upon the retirement of [[Jerome J. Hastrich]], then Bishop of Gallup on March 31, 1990, Pelotte became the Third Bishop of Gallup.&lt;ref name="Gallup bio" /&gt; From 1986 to 2008, Pelotte also served as the Episcopal moderator of the [[Tekakwitha Conference]], an association of Native American and First Nation Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tekconf.org/history.html Tekakwitha Conference History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610181704/http://www.tekconf.org/history.html |date=2010-06-10 }}. Retrieved 2008-07-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bishop Pelotte was seriously injured in his Gallup home on July 23, 2007. His injuries included  a traumatic [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injury]]. According to chancery officials and a police report, Pelotte insisted his injuries resulted from a fall down his home staircase; however, his aide speculated that he "looked like he'd been beat up" and that his injuries were more consistent with a brutal assault rather than with a fall down a carpeted stairwell.&lt;ref name="Out of ICU"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.gallupindependent.com/2007/august/080407ehb_bshpmvdfrmicu.html | title=Bishop moved from ICU | author=Elizabeth Hardin-Burrola | work=[[Gallup Independent]] | date=2007-08-04 | accessdate=2008-01-27 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010064842/http://www.gallupindependent.com/2007/august/080407ehb_bshpmvdfrmicu.html | archivedate=2007-10-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 3, 2008, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] appointed [[Thomas J. Olmsted]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix|Bishop of Phoenix]], as [[Apostolic administrator|apostolic administrator ''sede plena'']] of the diocese of Gallup, and granted Pelotte a one-year [[leave of absence]] to continue his recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.gallupindependent.com/2008/January/010408ehb_glpdcsbshpapntd.html | title=Pope steps in | work=[[Gallup Independent]] | date=2008-01-04 | accessdate=2008-01-27 | author=Elizabeth Hardin-Burrola | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210041123/http://www.gallupindependent.com/2008/January/010408ehb_glpdcsbshpapntd.html | archivedate=2008-02-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 2008 [[Pope]] Benedict XVI accepted the resignation from the pastoral government of the Diocese of Gallup, presented by Pelotte, SSS, in accordance with canon [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1E.HTM 401 §  2] of the [[Code of Canon Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cf.]] [http://212.77.1.245/news_services/bulletin/news/22062.php?index=22062&amp;lang=en Holy See Press Office, ''Daily Bulletin of 30.04.2008, Rinunce e nomine, Rinuncia del Vescovo di Gallup (U.S.A.)'']{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop Olmsted continued to govern the diocese as Apostolic Administrator until [[James S. Wall]] was appointed bishop of Gallup and took canonical possession of the Diocese on 23 April 2009.

On Monday, July 8, 2008, [[KRQE]] News 13 in [[Albuquerque]] and the Gallup Independent newspaper released the results of their investigation of the Pelotte case. Pictures that had not been previously released to the public suggested that the bishop suffered severe blows to the head and back. The station speculated that the injuries did not indicate a fall, but rather a possible beating. The police investigation was closed, though, having never been recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=HardinBurrola|first=Elizabeth|title=Photos of Bishop Donald E.

Pelotte was hospitalized in critical condition, with his relatives at his side, on December 30, 2009. He died on January 7, 2010. The Funeral Mass for Bishop Pelotte was held on Thursday, January 14, 2010, at the [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Gallup, New Mexico)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] in Gallup. Per his wishes, he was buried in the crypt of the Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark|first=Heather|title=Bishop Pelotte remembered in Gallup|url=http://www.krqe.com/news/pueblos-tribes/bishop-pelotte-remembered-in-gallup|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130902170237/http://www.krqe.com/news/pueblos-tribes/bishop-pelotte-remembered-in-gallup|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 September 2013|accessdate=2 September 2013|newspaper=KRQE Channel 13|date=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The child of a large family, Santillan was born and raised in [[Santiago del Estero]] province in [[Argentina]]. He began playing the “quena” as a young boy, developing his skills both technically and also in phrasing, tone production and vibrato.

From 1960, he played with the ensemble Los Amigos de Amambay, travelling and performing throughout Argentina and Spanish America. In 1970 he was invited to [[Paris]], [[France]], to record a selection of Andes flute repertoire for Riviera, accompanied by a small ensemble usually consisting of guitar, bass and tambour. El Conder Pasa was released as a single and three albums followed under the French title Sortiléges De La Flûte Des Andes or Flutes of the Andes in English speaking countries.
Billboard Magazine issue for 25 July 1970, reported 60,000 copies of the single sold in the first half of that year alone&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=dikEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|page=59|accessdate=2017-08-05|date=1970-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank McNab''' (or '''MacNab''') (died 1878) was a member of the [[Lincoln County Regulators|Regulators]] who fought on behalf of [[John Tunstall]] during the [[Lincoln County War]].

Of Scottish origin, McNab was a "cattle detective" who worked for Hunter, Evans, &amp; Company, which was managed by [[New Mexico]] cattleman [[John Chisum]]. McNab's job was to track down those who stole Chisum's cattle. Drifting into Lincoln County from the Texas Panhandle in the mid-1870s, he soon signed on with [[John Tunstall]], as his rivals, a group of cattlemen and cowboys from the Seven Rivers area of Lincoln County were allied with [[Lawrence Murphy]] and [[James Dolan (Lincoln County War)|James Dolan]].

With Tunstall's murder and the outbreak of war, McNab took a prominent position in the Regulator [[command hierarchy|chain of command]], second only to foreman [[Richard M. Brewer|Richard "Dick" Brewer]]. McNab, along with other deputized Regulators, captured Dolan gunmen William Morton and Frank Baker. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

As Morton was believed to have been one of those who killed John Tunstall, his fate looked grim, especially when the Regulators and their prisoners detoured on their way to Lincoln into the Capitan foothills. Although the Regulators were intent on killing Morton and Baker rather than turning them over for trial, one of their number, William McCloskey, was friendly with Morton and tried to talk the Regulators out of killing him. On March 9, 1878, the Regulators made their move along the Blackwater Creek. According to [[Pat Garrett]]'s biography of [[Billy the Kid]], McNab shot McCloskey in the head when he tried to stop the imminent execution of Morton and Baker, who then spurred their mounts and tried to escape before being gunned down by Billy the Kid. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

McNab was one of the triggermen in the killing of [[William J. Brady|Sheriff Brady]] and his deputy [[George W. Hindman]] in Lincoln on April 1, 1878, and was present three days later when they shot it out with [[Buckshot Roberts]]. Upon Dick Brewer's death, McNab was elected captain of the Regulators. On April 29, 1878, McNab, [[Ab Saunders]], and [[Frank Coe (Lincoln County War)|Frank Coe]] were on their way to the latter's ranch. Nine miles below Lincoln, they stopped at the Fritz ranch for a break when they were ambushed by Seven Rivers cowboys, and members of the [[Jesse Evans Gang]], all under the direction of newly appointed Sheriff [[George Peppin]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} 

Saunders was shot through the hip. Also wounded, McNab scrambled up a gully and tried to get away until a cowboy named Manuel "Indian" Segovia caught up with him and shotgunned him to death. Frank Coe surrendered after a shouted parley. In the wake of his death, [[Doc Scurlock]] was elected captain of the Regulators. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Posthumous== 
McNab's death was avenged several weeks later on May 15, when the Regulators invaded the Seven Rivers area and captured Segovia. He  made a futile attempt to escape only to be gunned down by [[Billy the Kid]] and Josefita Chavez.

'''Franz Hößler''', also '''Franz Hössler''' ({{Audio|Franz Hössler.ogg|listen}}; 4 February 1906 – 13 December 1945) was a [[Nazi]] [[Germans|German]] [[SS]]-''[[Obersturmführer]]'' and ''[[Schutzhaftlagerführer]]'' at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]], [[Dora-Mittelbau]] and [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] concentration camps during [[World War II]]. Captured by the Allies at the end of the war, Hößler was charged with [[crimes against humanity]] in the First [[Belsen Trial|Bergen-Belsen Trial]], found guilty, and sentenced to death. He was executed by hanging at [[Hameln|Hameln Prison]] in 1945.

== Early life ==
Hößler was born in 1906 in the town of Oberdorf, today [[Marktoberdorf]], in the [[Schwabenland]]  of the [[German Empire]]. The son of a [[construction foreman|foreman]], he quit school early to become a [[photographer]]. Later employed as a [[warehouse]] worker, he was [[unemployed]] during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Jens-Christian Wagner (ed.): ''Konzentrationslager Mittelbau-Dora 1943-1945'', Göttingen 2007, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Nazi Party]] in early November 1932 (member no. 1,374,713) and the [[SS]] (member no. 41,940).&lt;ref name=Lasik230&gt;Aleksander Lasik: "Die Organisationsstruktur des KL Auschwitz" in: Aleksander Lasik, Franciszek Piper, Piotr Setkiewicz, Irena Strzelecka (eds): ''Auschwitz  1940-1945. Studien zur Geschichte des Konzentrations und Vernichtungslagers Auschwitz.'', Volume I, State Museum Auschwitz-Birkenau, Oświęcim 1999, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Hößler was married and had three children.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Langbein: ''Menschen in Auschwitz.'' Frankfurt am Main 1980, p. 516&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in the SS, Hößler rose to the rank of [[SS]]-''[[Obersturmführer]]'' and became a reserve officer in the [[Waffen-SS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dws-xip.pl/reich/biografie/numery/numer41.html Franz Hößler] at www.dws-xip.pl&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Klee263&gt;Ernst Klee: ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich'', Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; After the establishment of the [[Dachau concentration camp]] in July 1933, he became the first member of the guard staff and worked later as a [[cook (profession)|cook]]. He served at Dachau until after the outbreak of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Auschwitz232&gt;State Museum of Auschwitz-Birkenau (ed.): ''Auschwitz in den Augen der SS.'' Oświęcim  1998, p.232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ARC&gt;[http://www.deathcamps.org/occupation/auschwitzmen_de.html#Hößler Short biography of Hößler at ARC Mainpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Auschwitz ==
In June 1940, Hößler was transferred to the newly opened [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz I concentration camp]] as it received the [[First mass transport to Auschwitz concentration camp|first mass transports]]. He managed the camp kitchens and was occasionally used as a subcamp supervisor ({{lang-de|Kommandoführer}}).&lt;ref name=Auschwitz232/&gt; He then became a Work Service Leader ({{lang-de|Arbeitsdienstführer}}) at the camp in early 1941.&lt;ref name=Lasik230/&gt; On 28 July 1941, Hößler accompanied a shipment of 575 selected Auschwitz I inmates to [[Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre|the euthanasia center at Sonnenstein Castle]], where they were murdered as part of the [[Action 14f13]] program.&lt;ref name = Orth138&gt;Karin Orth: ''Das System der nationalsozialistischen Konzentrationslager'', Hamburg 2002, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1942, Hößler, together with [[Otto Moll]] and [[Hans Aumeier]], participated in killing 168 survivors of a failed uprising in the punishment section of Auschwitz I.&lt;ref name=ARC/&gt; For a few months during 1942 he was also responsible for the construction of a holiday resort for the [[SS]] in [[Żywiec]], the so-called "[[Solahütte]]".&lt;ref name=Auschwitz232/&gt;

After [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] was formally expanded into an [[extermination camp]] in 1942, Hößler took on various commands there. From September to November 1942, a brigade composed of prisoners called ''[[Sonderkommando]] Hößler'' exhumed 107,000 corpses from mass graves around Auschwitz I in order to burn them in the new Auschwitz II crematoria. The prisoners of the ''Sonderkommando'' were then almost invariably murdered after the action. To conduct this disposal, Hößler, along with [[Rudolf Höß]] and [[Walter Dejaco]], had previously visited the [[Chelmno extermination camp]] on 16 September 1942 to observe tests conducted by [[Paul Blobel]].&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of [[Rudolf Höß]] in: State Museum Auschwitz-Birkenau (eds.): ''Auschwitz in den Augen der SS'', Oświęcim 1998, p. 79f&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time Hößler worked as before in the old crematorium at the main camp Auschwitz I, including gassings in the bunkers. [[Johann Kremer]], SS camp doctor from 30 August to 17 November 1942, recorded a transport of 1,703 Dutch Jews to the main camp managed by Hoßler. The incident was described in his diary:

{{quote box
|quote = In connection with the gassings I described in my diary dated 12.10.1942, I declare that on that day about 1,600 Dutch were gassed. This is an approximate figure, which I stated as a result of what I had heard from others. The action was led [by] SS officer Hößler. I remember that he tried to drive the whole group into a single bunker. This he achieved up to a last man who could not be crammed further into the bunker. Hoßler shot this man with a revolver. This is the reason why I wrote in the diary: "Gruesome scene before the last bunker! (Hößler!)".&lt;ref&gt;State Museum Auschwitz-Birkenau (ed.): ''Auschwitz in den Augen der SS'', Oświęcim 1998, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of 1943, Hößler became involved in recruiting so-called "[[Aryan]]" prison women, with the prospect of better food and care, for a newly opened camp brothel at the Auschwitz I main camp.&lt;ref name = Langbein&gt;Hermann Langbein: ''Menschen in Auschwitz'', Frankfurt am Main, 1980, p. 455&lt;/ref&gt; He was then promoted to the senior role of ''[[Schutzhaftlagerführer]]'' at the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] women's camp in August 1943, which he directed together with ''[[Oberaufseherin]]'' [[Maria Mandel]]. In this role he participated in selections and gassings.  He succeeded [[Paul Heinrich Theodor Müller]] in this capacity.  [[Filip Müller]], one of the very few ''Sonderkommando'' members who survived [[Auschwitz]], [[paraphrased]] Hößler's speech given to trick a group of Greek Jews in the undressing room at the portals of the gas chambers:

{{quote box
|quote    = On behalf of the camp administration I bid you welcome. This is not a holiday resort but a labor camp.  Just as our soldiers risk their lives at the front to gain victory for the [[Third Reich]], you will have to work here for the welfare of a new Europe. How you tackle this task is entirely up to you. The chance is there for every one of you. We shall look after your health, and we shall also offer you well-paid work. After the war we shall assess everyone according to his merits and treat him accordingly.

Now, would you please all get undressed. Hang your clothes on the hooks we have provided and please remember your number [of the hook]. When you've had your bath there will be a bowl of soup and coffee or tea for all. Oh yes, before I forget, after your bath, please have ready your certificates, diplomas, school reports and any other documents so that we can employ everybody according to his or her training and ability.

Would diabetics who are not allowed sugar report to staff on duty after their baths.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hellman, Lili Meier, [[Beate Klarsfeld]] (eds) ''The Auschwitz Album'', Random House, New York, 1981, {{ISBN|0-394-51932-9}} p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

For a short time between 15 March to 15 May 1944, Hößler was also camp commander ({{lang-de|KZ-Kommandant}}) of the Neckarelz concentration camp in [[Mosbach]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], a subcamp of the larger [[Natzweiler-Struthof]] camp complex in occupied France. Following the [[Allied invasion of France]] in June 1944, he returned to the Auschwitz main camp where he was Protective Custody Camp Leader until its final evacuation in January 1945.&lt;ref name=Auschwitz232/&gt;

== Dora-Mittelbau ==
In January 1945, as the [[Red Army]] overran German positions on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], the SS personnel at Auschwitz evacuated to the [[Mittelbau-Dora]] concentration camp. Auschwitz commander [[Richard Baer (Nazi)|Richard Baer]] took over the Dora portion of the complex and Hößler was again made a Protective Custody Camp Leader.&lt;ref name=Wagner&gt;Jens-Christian Wagner, ''Produktion des Todes: Das KZ Mittelbau-Dora'' (Göttingen, 2001) p. 670&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 April 1945, as American [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] closed in on Mittelbau-Dora, Hößler led a forced evacuation of prisoners to the railhead for transfer to the still-functioning [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]]. The prisoners were then led on a [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death march]] for the last stage of their journey.&lt;ref name=archives&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/captured-german-records/microfilm/m1079.pdf |format=pdf |title=United States of America v.

== Bergen-Belsen ==
[[File:Hoessler Franz.jpg|thumb|Franz Hössler at [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]]]]

On 8 April 1945, Hößler arrived with his transport at [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] and became deputy camp commander under [[Josef Kramer]].&lt;ref&gt;Jens-Christian Wagner: [https://archive.is/20120714143529/http://images.zeit.de/text/2005/04/A-Auschwitz "Inferno und Befreiung - Auschwitz im Harz], in: ''[[Die Zeit]]'', Nr.4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; There he directly shot prisoners until the liberation of the camp, crimes for which he would be eventually arrested and tried. On 15 April 1945, Hößler was found hiding among the prisoners in camouflaged clothing and was detained with the remaining SS staff by a unit of the [[British Army]]. The SS detainees were then forced to bury thousands of corpses lying around on the camp grounds in mass graves.&lt;ref name = Orth266&gt;Karin Orth: ''Die Konzentrationslager-SS'', München 2004, p. 266f.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conviction and execution ==
Hößler and 44 other camp staff were tried in the [[Belsen Trial]] by a British military court at [[Lüneburg]]. The trial lasted several weeks from September to November 1945. During the trial [[Anita Lasker-Wallfisch|Anita Lasker]] testified that he took part in selections for the gas chamber.&lt;ref name=witness&gt;{{cite book | publisher=[[United Nations War Crimes Commission]] |location=London | title=Law reports of trials of war criminals, selected and prepared by the United Nations War Crimes Commission. – Volume II, The Belsen Trial| year=1947 | page=21f | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/Law-Reports_Vol-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 November 1945 Hößler was sentenced to death by hanging. The sentence was carried out by British hangman [[Albert Pierrepoint]] on 13 December 1945 at [[Hameln]] prison.&lt;ref name=Auschwitz232/&gt;

== Life ==

Tyutchev was born into a [[Russian nobility|Russian noble]] family in the Ovstug family estate near [[Bryansk]] (modern-day [[Zhukovsky District, Bryansk Oblast]] of [[Russia]]). His father Ivan Nikolaevich Tyutchev (1768—1846) was a [[Table of ranks#Table of Ranks|court councillor]] who served in the Kremlin Expedition that managed all building and restoration works of Moscow palaces. One of Ivan's sisters, [[:ru:Мещерская, Евдокия Николаевна|Evdokia Meshcherskaya]] (1774—1837), was a [[hegumen]]ia famous for founding the Borisoglebsky Anosin Women's Monastery.&lt;ref name='aksakov'&gt;''[[Ivan Aksakov]] (1997)''.

Part 6, June 23, 1801 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; Fyodor's mother Ekaterina Lvovna Tolstaya (1776—1866) belonged to the [[Tolstoy family]] on her father's side and the Rimsky-Korsakov noble house on her mother's side. Russian war general [[Alexander Korsakov|Alexander Rimsky-Korsakov]] was her uncle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gerbovnik.ru/arms/202.html Rimsky-Korsakov coat of arms] by All-Russian Armorials of Noble Houses of the Russian Empire. Part 2, June 30, 1798 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='aksakov' /&gt;&lt;ref name='chagin' /&gt;

Most of his childhood years were spent in Moscow, where he joined the literary circle of Professor Merzlyakov at the age of 13. His first printed work was a translation of [[Horace]]'s epistle to [[Maecenas]], published when he was still 15. From that time on, his poetic language was distinguished from that of Pushkin and other contemporaries by its liberal use of majestic, solemn Slavonic archaisms.

His family tutor was [[Semyon Raich]], a minor poet and translator under whose guidance Tyutchev undertook his first poetic steps. From 1819 to 1821 Tyutchev studied at the Philological Faculty of [[Moscow University]]. After graduating he joined the Foreign Office and in 1822 accompanied his relative, Count [[Ostermann-Tolstoy]], to [[Munich]] to take up a post as trainee diplomat at the Russian legation. He was to remain abroad for 22 years.

In Munich he fell in love with [[Amalie Adlerberg|Amalie von Lerchenfeld]], the illegitimate half-sister of a young Bavarian diplomat, Count Maximilian Joseph von Lerchenfeld. Tyutchev's poem ''Tears'' or ''Slyozy'' (''Liubliu, druz'ya, laskat' ochami...'') coincides with one of their meetings, and is most likely dedicated to Amalie (or Amélie, as she was usually known). Among other poems inspired by her are ''K. N.'', and ''Ia pomniu vremia zolotoe…'' Published extracts from the letters and diaries of Maximilian von Lerchenfeld illuminate the first years of Tyutchev as a diplomat in Munich (1822–1826), giving details of his [[frustration|frustrated]] love affair for Amélie, nearly involving a duel (probably with his colleague, Baron [[Alexander von Krüdener]]), in January 1825. Amélie was coerced by her relatives into marrying the much older Krüdener, but she and Tyutchev continued to be friends and frequented the same diplomatic society in Munich. A late poem of 1870 with the title ''K.B.'' (''Ia vstretil vas - i vsio biloe''), long accepted on dubious evidence as addressed to Amélie, is now thought much more likely to refer to Tyutchev's sister-in-law Clotilde (or Klothilde) von Bothmer.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolayev, A.A., 'Zagaka "K.B."', ''Neva'', 1988, No. 2, pp. 190-196.&lt;/ref&gt; Tyutchev's last meeting with Amélie took place on March 31, 1873 (OS) when she visited him on his deathbed. The next day, Tyutchev wrote to his daughter Daria: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yesterday I felt a moment of burning emotion due to my meeting with... my dear Amalie Krüdener who wished to see me for the last time in this world and came to take her leave of me. In her person my past and the best years of my life came to give me a farewell kiss.&lt;ref&gt;F.I. Tyutchev, ''Polnoe sobranie sochineniy i pis'ma'', 6 vols., Moscow, 2002-2005. VI, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Munich, he came under the influence of the German Romantic movement, and this is reflected in his poetry. Among the figures, he knew personally were the poet [[Heinrich Heine]] and the philosopher [[Friedrich Schelling]]. In 1826, he married the [[Bavaria]]n widow of a Russian diplomat [[Eleonore Peterson]], née Countess von Bothmer. She became the mother of his daughter [[Anna Tiuttjev]].  Following her death in 1838, Tyutchev married another aristocratic young German widow, Baroness [[Ernestine von Dörnberg]], née von Pfeffel, who had become his mistress and had a child by him while Eleonore was still alive. Neither of his wives understood Russian to begin with (Ernestine made efforts to learn the language only much later). That is hardly surprising since Tyutchev spoke French better than Russian and nearly all his private correspondence was in the former language. 
[[Image:Owstug.JPG|thumb|left|The manor of Tyutchev's father in the [[Bryansk Oblast|Bryansk region]]]]

In 1836, a young former colleague at the Munich legation, Prince Ivan Gagarin, obtained Tyutchev's permission to publish his selected poems in ''[[Sovremennik]]'', a literary journal edited by Pushkin. Although appreciated by the great Russian poet, the superb lyrics failed to spark off any public interest. The death of Eleonore in 1838 hit Tyutchev hard and appears to have silenced him as a poet for some considerable time, and for ten years afterwards, he wrote hardly any lyric verse. Instead, he turned his attention to publishing political articles in Western periodicals such as the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'' outlining his strongly held views on Russia's role in the world (see below).

In 1837, Tyutchev was transferred from Munich to the Russian legation in [[Turin]]. He found his new place of residence uncongenial to his disposition and after marrying Ernestine, he resigned from his position there to settle in Munich. It was later discovered that Tyutchev had actually abandoned his post as chargé d'affaires in Turin without official permission to marry in Switzerland, and he was dismissed from the Foreign Service as a result. He continued to live in Germany for five more years without position before returning to Russia. Upon his eventual return to [[St Petersburg]] in 1844, the poet was much lionised in the highest society. His daughter Kitty caused a sensation, and the novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] wooed her, "almost prepared to marry her impassively, without love, but she received me with studied coldness", as he remarked in a diary. Kitty would later become influential at [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]]'s circle at the Russian court. Not long after his return to Russia, Tyutchev was reinstated in government service as a censor, rising eventually to become Chairman of the Foreign Censorship Committee and a Privy Councillor.

Tyutchev loved to travel, often volunteering for diplomatic courier missions as a way of combining business with pleasure. One of his lengthiest and most significant missions was to newly independent Greece in the autumn of 1833. During his years abroad there were visits home on leave, and after settling in Russia in 1844, he would sometimes spend short periods on the family estate at Ovstug. Tours undertaken in a private capacity took him to many parts of continental Europe, including Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. He was particularly drawn to the Swiss lakes and mountains. Many of his best poems were inspired by such journeys.

As a poet, Tyutchev was little known during his lifetime. His 400 or so short poems were the only pieces he ever wrote in Russian. Tyutchev regarded his poems as ''bagatelles'', not worthy of publication. He generally did not care to write them down and, if he did, he would often lose papers they were scribbled upon. [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], when listing Russian poets in 1850, praised Tyutchev as one of the most talented among "minor poets". It was only in 1854 that his first volume of verse was printed, which was prepared by [[Ivan Turgenev]] and others without any help from the author.

In 1850, he began an illicit affair with [[Elena Denisyeva]], over twenty years his junior. She remained his mistress until her death from [[tuberculosis]] in 1864, and she bore him three children. The affair produced a body of lyrics rightly considered among the finest love poems in the language. Permeated with a sublime feeling of subdued despair, the so-called "Denisyeva Cycle" has been variously described by critics as "a novel in verse", "a human document, shattering in the force of its emotion", and "a few songs without comparison in Russian, perhaps even in world poetry".&lt;ref&gt;I.V. Petrova; K.V. Pigarev; D.S. Merezhkovsky. Quoted in John Dewey, ''Mirror of the Soul. A Life of the Poet Fyodor Tyutchev'', Shaftesbury (Brimstone Press), 2010, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the poems, ''Last Love'', is often cited as emblematic of the whole cycle.

In the early 1870s, the deaths of his brother, son and daughter left Tyutchev deeply depressed. (Depression was something from which he suffered at intervals throughout his life.) Following a series of strokes, he died in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] in 1873 and was interred at [[Novodevichy Cemetery (Saint Petersburg)|Novodevichy Monastery in St. Petersburg]]. Ernestine survived him by 21 years.

==Political views==
He was a militant [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist]], who never needed a particular reason to berate the Western powers, [[Holy See|Vatican]], [[Ottoman Empire]] or [[Poland]], the latter perceived by him as a Judas in the Slavic fold. The failure of the [[Crimean War]] made him look critically at the Russian government as well.

On domestic matters, he held broadly liberal views. He warmly welcomed most of the reforms of [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]], particularly the [[Emancipation Reform of 1861]]. Both in his work as a censor and in his writings, he promoted the ideal of freedom of expression, frequently incurring the wrath of his superiors as a result, even under the more relaxed regime of Alexander II.

His fairly sizeable output of verse on political subjects is largely forgotten. One exception is a short poem which has become something of a popular maxim in Russia: 
{{Quotation|
:Who would grasp Russia with the mind?
:For her no yardstick was created:
:Her soul is of a special kind,
:By faith alone appreciated.
:::::::::::(translated by John Dewey)}}

== Poetry ==

Tyutchev is one of the most memorized and quoted Russian poets. [[Occasional poetry|Occasional pieces]], translations and political poems constitute about a half of his overall poetical output.

The 200 or so lyric pieces which represent the core of his poetic genius, whether describing a scene of nature or passions of love, put a premium on metaphysics. Tyutchev's world is bipolar. He commonly operates with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Each of these images is imbued with specific meaning. Tyutchev's idea of night, for example, was defined by critics as "the poetic image often covering economically and simply the vast notions of time and space as they affect man in his struggle through life". [https://archive.is/20080227084942/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/001/241/1.htm] In the chaotic and fathomless world of "night", "winter", or "north" man feels himself tragically abandoned and lonely. Hence, a modernist sense of frightening anxiety permeates his poetry. Unsurprisingly, it was not until the late 19th and early 20th century that Tyutchev was rediscovered and hailed as a great poet by the [[Russian Symbolists]] such as [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Andrey Bely]] and [[Alexander Blok]].

== Sample of verse ==

''Silentium!'' is an archetypal poem by Tyutchev. Written in 1830, it is remarkable for its rhythm crafted so as to make reading in [[silence]] easier than aloud toward [[alterity|others]]. Like so many of his poems, its images are [[anthropomorphic]] and pulsing with [[pantheism]]. As one Russian critic put it, "the temporal epochs of human life, its past and its present fluctuate and vacillate in equal measure: the unstoppable current of time erodes the outline of the present." {{note|nasledstvo}} 
[[File:Fedor Tutchev.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portrait by [[Sergei Lvovich Levitsky|Levitsky]], 1856.]]
:Speak not, lie hidden, and conceal
:the way you dream, the things you feel.
:Deep in your spirit let them rise
:akin to stars in crystal skies
:that set before the night is blurred:
:delight in them and speak no word.

:How can a heart expression find?
:How should another know your mind?
:Will he discern what quickens you?
:A thought, once uttered, is untrue.
:Dimmed is the fountainhead when stirred:
:drink at the source and speak no word.

:Live in your inner self alone
:within your soul a world has grown,
:the magic of veiled thoughts that might
:be blinded by the outer light,
:drowned in the noise of day, unheard...
:take in their song and speak no word. 
:::::::::::(trans. by [[Vladimir Nabokov]])

Incidentally, this poem inspired an early-20th-century composer, [[Georgi Catoire]] (the setting of the poem in the song ''Silentium''), while another one of Tyutchev's poems, "O chem ty voesh' vetr nochnoy...", was the inspiration for [[Nikolai Medtner]]'s ''Night Wind'' piano sonata (#7) of 1911. There is a well-known setting by [[Rakhmaninov]] of Tyutchev's poem ''Spring Waters''. While the title of [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]]'s 1910 tone poem, "Silence", may have been borrowed from Tyutchev, the inspiration is credited to one of Edgar Allan Poe's tales. The same poem was also set to music by the 20th-century Russian composer, [[Boris Tchaikovsky]] (1925-1996), in his 1974 cantata "Signs of the Zodiac". The Ukrainian&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentyn_Sylvestrov&lt;/ref&gt; composer, Valentyn Sylvestrov (born 1937), has made a memorable setting of 'Last Love', recorded by Alexi Lubimov and Jana Ivanilova on the album 'Stufen'.  At the end of [[Andrey Tarkovsky]]'s film [[Stalker (1979 film)|''Stalker'']], a character recites a Tyutchev poem. In 2007, Icelandic musician [[Björk]] used this same Tyutchev poem for the lyrics to "[[The Dull Flame Of Desire]]" from her album ''[[Volta (album)|Volta]]''.The song was later released as a single in 2008. The 2011 contemporary classical album [[Troika (album)|Troika]] includes a setting of Tyutchev’s French-language poem “Nous avons pu tous deux…” by the composer [[Isabelle Aboulker]].

'''Georges Darien''' (pseudonym for ''Georges Hippolyte Adrien''), (6 April 1862 – 19 August 1921), was a French writer associated with [[anarchism]] and an outspoken advocate of [[Georgism]].

== Life ==

Georges-Hippolyte Adrien was born at 46, Rue du Bac in Paris, to linen draper Honoré-Charles-Emile Adrien, born in 1822 in the [[Charente]], and Françoise-Sidonie Adrien, née Chatel. His brother, Henri-Gaston Darien, was born two years later, in 1864. Henri-Gaston was later to become a ''peintre du genre'' specializing in interiors and scenes of Paris life. He exhibited in the Salons of 1896 and 1897, received the [[Légion d'honneur]] in 1910, and died in 1926.

Darien's mother died in 1869. His father remarried an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] [[Protestant]], Elise-Antoinette Schlumberger, born in 1839. Their daughter Jeanne was born in 1873 in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] and died in 1914. Strict religiosity of Darien's stepmother contrasted with the [[anti-clericalism|anti-clericalist]] views that he would come to adopt.

Following an undistinguished baccalaureate earned at the Lycée Charlemagne in Paris, in March 1881, Darien voluntarily enlisted in the army for five years. Between June 1883 and March 1886, he served in a disciplinary unit, the [[Battalions of Light Infantry of Africa]], in the [[Tunisia]]n desert. His service there included a total of nearly a year of confinement in Gafsa, the [[Tunis]]ian prison camp.

In 1889 Darien published his first book, ''Bas les cœurs!'', a satire of the impact of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] of 1870 and the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871 on a French bourgeois family living in the provinces. It was followed in 1890 by ''Biribi, discipline militaire''. As experienced personally by the author, the prison camp was not a mere penitentiary; it was the ultimate punishment that the French Army reserved for its insubordinates. The book inspired a campaign that succeeded, albeit only nominally, in the reform of prison camps. However, the Gafsa camp remained open until the 1920s, succumbing as a result of a campaign conducted by [[Albert Londres]]. The same year saw the publication of ''Les Chapons'' and ''Les vrais Sous-offs'', followed in 1891 by ''Les Pharisiens'', a fictional indictment of French [[antisemitism]] and its most prominent advocate, [[Édouard Drumont]], and the only exception among the novels that Darien uniformly narrated in the first person.

Between 1893 and 1905, Darien frequently travelled to and resided in London. He embraced British culture and became a fluent speaker and writer of English. He also lived in [[Brussels]] and [[Wiesbaden]]. Many aspects of his life between 1891 and 1897 remain unknown. Darien's lifelong paucity of official earnings has inspired some of his readers to impute the fictional exploits of Georges Randal, the daring burglar protagonist of his 1897 novel ''Le Voleur'', to its author.

In 1899 Darien married Suzanne Caroline Abresch, born in 1863 in London, of German parents. In the following year he wrote his violent pamphlet ''La Belle France''. It was published in 1901 by Stock. In 1903 and 1904 Darien contributed articles to the anarchist periodical ''L'Ennemi du peuple'' until its demise, precipitated by his polemic with [[Charles Malato]]. He played a prominent part among the organizers and participants of the Antimilitarist Congress that took place in [[Amsterdam]] in June and July 1904. In the same year Darien published ''L'Épaulette'', which inaugurated the program of complementing ''[[La Comédie humaine|The Human Comedy]]'' of [[Balzac|Honoré de Balzac]] with his own ''Comédie inhumaine''. ''Gottlieb Krumm: made in England''. Written in English, this novel recounts the story of its [[eponym]]ous narrator and protagonist, a nearly penniless adventurer who embarks for England with his wife and their three children after squandering her dowry in their native Germany. Krumm makes no secret of his character: "I am not hindered by common scruples (if I am not familiar with them, it is only because I wish to have for them a lasting respect, and familiarity breeds contempt)." Determined to make a fortune, he employs unorthodox means including arson, extortion, matrimonial swindle, and imposture. Krumm's unsavory stratagems yield spectacular success in the financial capital of the ''[[fin de siècle]]''.

Throughout his early life, Darien disclaimed all political affiliations:&lt;blockquote&gt;{{Quotation|''Inutile de vous dire que je ne me donne ni comme socialiste ni comme anarchiste, je n'ai rien à faire avec ces vieilleries. Je suis simplement un homme révolté par l'horreur de la situation générale et, n'étant ni assez intelligent ni assez savant pour me conduire en citoyen du monde, je désire me révolter simplement comme Français.''

{{lang-en|It is useless to tell you that I present myself neither as a socialist nor as an anarchist; I have nothing to do with these relics. I am simply a man revolted by the horror of the general situation and, being neither sufficiently intelligent nor sufficiently learned to comport myself as a citizen of the world, I wish to revolt simply as a Frenchman.}}}}

(Quoted by Auriant.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Darien anticipated [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]] by pointing out the convergence of the aspirations of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie towards their consolidation within a single class. His political idiosyncrasy gave way to an espousal of [[Georgism]], which he discovered some time in the late 1890s. Starting in 1912, Darien vigorously promoted the Georgist ideal of a single land value tax through the ''Ligue pour l'Impôt unique''. Toward the same end, he involved himself in politics by running without any success in local, cantonal, and legislative elections of Paris.

Dedicating himself to theater, Darien saw ''Le Parvenu'' staged at the [[Bouffes du Nord]], followed by ''Chez les Zoaques'', featuring young [[Sacha Guitry]]. His activities between 1914 and 1918, during ''[[World War I|La Grande Guerre]]'', remain unknown. Widowed and remarried, Georges Darien died on 19 August 1921.

[[André Breton]] characterized Darien as "A heart too big and beating too well not to knock in every sense against the walls of its cage."&lt;ref&gt;"Un cœur trop grand et trop bien battant pour ne pas heurter en tout sens les parois de sa cage."&lt;/ref&gt; He described his writings as "the most rigorous assault that I know against hypocrisy, imposture, stupidity, cowardice".&lt;ref&gt;("le plus rigoureux assaut que je sache contre l'hypocrisie, l'imposture, la sottise, la lâcheté")&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giganti di Messina (Mata e Grifone) - Messina (Sicily) - Italy - 15 Aug. 2009 - (4).jpg|thumb|Giants [[Zanclus|Mata and Grifone]] celebrated in [[Messina]] in August, [[Sicily]]]]
'''Giants''' (from [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]]: ''[[wiktionary:gigas|gigas]]'', cognate [[wiktionary:giga-|giga-]]) are [[being]]s of human appearance, but of prodigious size and strength common in the [[mythology]] and [[legend]]s of many different [[cultures]]. The word ''giant'', first attested in 1297, was derived from the ''[[Gigantes]]'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Γίγαντες}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0073%3Aentry%3D*gi%2Fgantes γίγαντες], Georg Autenrieth, ''A Homeric Dictionary'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;) of [[Greek mythology]].

In various [[Indo-European mythology|Indo-European mythologies]], gigantic peoples are featured as [[wikt:primeval|primeval]] creatures associated with chaos and the wild nature, and they are frequently in conflict with the gods, be they [[Olympian gods|Olympian]], [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]], [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]] or [[Æsir|Norse]]. Giants also often play similar roles in the mythologies and folklore of other, non Indo-European peoples, such as in the [[Nart sagas|Nartian]] traditions.

There are also accounts of giants in the [[Old Testament]]. Some of these are called [[Nephilim]], a word often translated as giant although this translation is not universally accepted. They include [[Og]] King of [[Bashan]], the Nephilim, the [[Anakim]], and the giants of [[Egypt]] mentioned in 1 Chronicles 11:23. The first mention of the Nephilim is found in Genesis 6:4; attributed to them are extraordinary strength and physical proportions.

[[Fairy tales]] such as "[[Jack the Giant Killer]]" have formed the modern perception of giants as stupid and violent monsters, sometimes said to eat humans, while other giants tend to eat the livestock. The antagonist in "[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]" is often described as a giant. In some more recent portrayals, like those of [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Roald Dahl]], some giants are both intelligent and friendly.

== Religion and mythology ==
[[File:Osmar Schindler David und Goliath.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[David]] faces [[Goliath]] in this 1888 lithograph by [[Osmar Schindler]]]]

=== Abrahamic mythology ===
Genesis tells of the [[Nephilim]] before and after [[Noah's Flood]]. According to Genesis 7:23, the Nephilim were destroyed in the Flood, but Nephilim are reported after the Flood, including:
* the [[Anakite]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Numbers|13:28–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Emite]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|2:10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Amorite]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Amos|2:9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblestudytools.com/concordances/naves-topical-bible/amorites.html Nave's Topical Bible: Amorites], Nave, Orville J., Retrieved:2013-03-14&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Rephaite]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Joshua|12:4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book of Numbers&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Numbers|13:28–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes the discouraging report by the spies which [[Moses]] sent into [[Canaan]]: “We can’t attack those people; they are stronger than we are. (...) All the people we saw there are of great size.  We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.” However, the [[Book of Joshua]], describing the actual conquest of Canaan in a later generation, makes no reference to such people living there.

The Bible also tells of [[Gog and Magog#Giants|Gog and Magog]], who later entered European folklore, and of the famous battle between [[David]] and the Philistine [[Goliath]]. While Goliath is often portrayed as a giant in retellings of the Biblical narrative, he is much smaller than other biblical giants.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The 1st-century Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]], and the 1st-2nd-century BC [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] give Goliath's height as "four [[cubit]]s and a [[Span (length)|span]]," approximately 2.00 m or about six feet seven inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sol.sci.uop.edu/~jfalward/James_Juris.htm|title=Variants of Bible Manuscripts|website=uop.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227023513/http://sol.sci.uop.edu/~jfalward/James_Juris.htm|archivedate=2008-12-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The King James translation of the Bible reports the giant Goliath as "six cubits and a span" in height—about nine feet nine inches tall, (over 2.75 m) ({{Bibleref|1Samuel|17:4|9}} KJV), but the [[Septuagint]], a Greek Bible, gives Goliath's height as "four cubits and a span" (~2.00 m). For comparison, the Anakites are described as making the Israelites seem like grasshoppers.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Numbers|13:33}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Gibborim (biblical)|Gibborim]].

[[Josephus]] also described the Amorites as giants in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', circa 93 AD, indicating that fossil evidence still remained at that time:&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, David Noel, ed., ''The Anchor Bible Dictionary'', (New York: Doubleday, 1997, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; "For which reason they removed their camp to Hebron; and when they had taken it, they slew all the inhabitants. There were till then left the race of giants, who had bodies so large, and countenances so entirely different from other men, that they were surprising to the sight, and terrible to the hearing. The bones of these men are still shown to this very day, unlike to any credible relations of other men."&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'', Book 5, Chapter 2, Number 3, [http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/ant-5.htm Antiquities of the Jews: Book 5], Retrieved: 15 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]], giants known as ''jababirat'' or ''jabbirun'' ({{lang-ar|جبارون}} "tyrants" or "giants"; singular, {{lang-ar|جبار}} {{transl|ar|ALA|Jabbar}}) such as [[Goliath#Islam|Jalut]] (Goliath) are mentioned,{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} as well as [[‘Uj ibn Anaq]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The [[Book of Enoch]] describes giants as the offspring of [[Watcher (angel)|Watcher]]s and women in 7:2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/boe/boe010.htm|title=The Book of Enoch: The Book of Enoch: Chapter VII|work=sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Armenian mythology ===
Hayk was known as the founder of the Armenian state. Hayk was part of a race of giants who helped construct the tower of Babel. Ancient historian [[Movses Khorenatsi]] wrote, "Hayk was handsome and personable, with curly hair, sparkling eyes and strong arms. Among the giants he was the bravest and most famous, opponent of all who raised their hand to become absolute ruler over the giants and heroes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khatchadourian|first1=Arpine|title=David of Sassoun: An Introduction to the Study of the Armenian Epic|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mount Nemrut]] is known to have received its name from an Armenian tradition in which Nimrod was killed by an arrow shot by Hayk during a massive battle between two rival armies of giants to the south-east of Lake Van.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Andrew|title=From the Ashes of Angels: The Forbidden Legacy of a Fallen Race|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-VkoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT159&amp;dq=armenia+giants+battle+hayk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEkoThtezUAhXHKyYKHYfIAioQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=hayk&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Baltic mythology ===
According to [[Baltic mythology]], the playing of a giantess named Neringa on the seashore formed the [[Curonian Spit]] ("neria, nerge, neringia" means land which is diving up and down like a swimmer). This character also appears in other myths (in some of which she is shown as a young strong woman, similar to a female version of the Greek [[Heracles]]). "[[Neringa Municipality|Neringa]]" is the name of a modern town on the spot.

=== Basque mythology ===
Giants are rough but generally righteous characters of formidable strength living up the hills of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. Giants stand for the Basque people reluctant to convert to Christianity who decide to stick to the old life style and customs in the forest. Sometimes they hold the secret of ancient techniques and wisdom unknown to the Christians, like in the legend of [[San Martin Txiki]], while their most outstanding feature is their strength. It follows that in many legends all over the Basque territory the giants are held accountable for the creation of many stone formations, hills and ages-old megalithic structures ([[dolmen]]s, etc.), with similar explanations provided in different spots.

However, giants show different variants and forms, they are most frequently referred to as [[jentilak]] and [[mairuak]], while as individuals they can be represented as [[Basajaun]] ('the lord of the forests'), Sanson (development of the biblical [[Samson]]), Errolan (based on the [[Franks|Frankish]] army general [[Roland]] who fell dead at the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]) or even [[Tartalo]] (a one-eyed giant akin to the Greek [[Cyclops]]).

=== Bulgarian mythology ===
{{Main|Ispolin (Bulgarian mythology)}}
In [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] mythology, giants called [[Ispolin (Bulgarian mythology)|ispolini]] inhabited the Earth before modern humans. They lived in the mountains, fed on raw meat and often fought against dragons. Ispolini were afraid of [[blackberry|blackberries]] which posed a danger of tripping and dying, so they offered sacrifices to that plant.&lt;ref name="stoynev"&gt;{{cite book|last=Стойнев|first=Анани|author2=Димитър Попов |author3=Маргарита Василева |author4=Рачко Попов |title=Българска митология. Енциклопедичен речник|year=2006|publisher=изд. Захари Стоянов|language=Bulgarian|isbn=954-739-682-X|pages=147–148|chapter=Исполини}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greek mythology ===
{{Main|Giants (Greek mythology)}}
In [[Greek mythology]] the ''[[Giants (Greek mythology)|Gigantes]]'' (γίγαντες) were (according to the poet [[Hesiod]]) the children of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] (Ουρανός) and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Γαία) (spirits of the sky and the earth) where some depictions had them with snake-like legs. They were involved in a conflict with the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]] called the ''[[Gigantomachy]]'' (Γιγαντομαχία) when Gaia had them attack [[Mount Olympus]]. This battle was eventually settled when the hero [[Heracles]] decided to help the Olympians. The Greeks believed some of them, like [[Enceladus (giant)|Enceladus]], to lay buried from that time under the earth and that their tormented quivers resulted in [[earthquakes]] and [[volcanic eruption]]s.

[[Herodotus]] in Book 1, Chapter 68, describes how the Spartans uncovered in [[Tegea]] the body of [[Orestes]] which was seven cubits long—around 10 feet (3 meters). In his book ''The Comparison of Romulus with Theseus'' [[Plutarch]] describes how the Athenians uncovered the body of [[Theseus]], which was ''of more than ordinary size''. The kneecaps of [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] were exactly the size of a discus for the boy's pentathlon, wrote [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. A boy's discus was about twelve centimeters in diameter, while a normal adult patella is around five centimeters, suggesting Ajax may have been around 14 feet (~4.3 meters) tall.

The [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]], usually children of Gods (Olympians) and nature spirits (nereids, naiads and dryads), are also compared to giants due to their huge size (Polyphemus, son of Poseidon and Thoosa, and nemesis of Odysseus, comes to mind). The Elder Cyclopes were the children of Gaia and Uranus where they later made Zeus' Master Thunderbolt, Poseidon's Trident, and Hades' Helm of Darkness during the Titanomachy.

The [[Hecatoncheires]] are giants that have 100 arms and 50 heads who were also the children of Gaia and Uranus.

Other known giant races in Greek mythology include the six-armed [[Gegenees|Gegeines]], the northern [[Hyperborea]]ns, and the cannibalistic [[Laestrygonians]].

=== Hindu mythology ===
{{Refimprove section||date=November 2015}}
In [[Hinduism]], the giants are called [[Daitya]]s. The Daityas (दैत्य) were the children of [[Diti]] and the sage [[Kashyapa]] who fought against the gods or [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] because they were jealous of their Deva half-brothers. Since Daityas were a power-seeking race, they sometimes allied with other races having similar ideology namely [[Danavas]] and [[Asuras]]. Daityas along with Danavas and Asuras are sometimes called [[Rakshasas]], the generic term for a demon in Hindu mythology. Some known Daityas include [[Hiranyakashipu]] and [[Hiranyaksha]]. The main antagonist of the Hindu epic [[Ramayana]], [[Ravana]], was a [[Brahmin]] from his father's side and a Daitya from his mother's side. His younger brother [[Kumbhakarna]] was said to be as tall as a mountain and was quite good natured.

=== Jain mythology ===
According to [[Jain]]s, there was a time when giants walked upon this earth.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=226}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/topic/Tirthankara|title=Tirthankara|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jain cosmology]] divides worldly cycle of time into two parts or half-cycles, ''avasarpani'' (age of descending purity) and ascending (''utsarpani'').{{sfn|Jain|2015|p=175}}
[[File:Jain Cosmic Time Cycle.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Division of time as envisaged by Jains. Human beings are said to be much taller than today in the first four ''aras'' of ''avasarpani'' and last four ''aras'' of ''utsarpani''.]]
According to [[Jain texts]], the height of [[Rishabha]], first ''[[tirthankara]]'' of present half cycle of time (''avasarpani'') was 500 ''dhanusa'' (longbow).{{sfn|Jain|2015|p=181}}
In ''avasarpani'', as the cycle moves ahead, height of all humans and animals decreases. The following table depicts the six ''aras'' of ''avasarpini''–

=== Native American mythologies ===
According to [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] oral history, the [[Si-Te-Cah]] or Sai'i are a legendary tribe of red-haired [[cannibalistic]] giants, the remains of which were allegedly found in 1911 by [[guano]] miners in Nevada's [[Lovelock Cave]].&lt;ref name="Loud, Llewellyn L. 1929"&gt;Loud, Llewellyn L.; M. R. Harrington (15 February 1929). "Lovelock Cave". University of California Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnology (University of California at Berkeley) 25 (1): 1–183.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Paiute creation story tells of "beautiful giants" who once lived between the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains. After giving birth to a disfigured child, the giants treated the child so poorly that the Great Spirit responded by making the land hot and desolate and allowing enemies to conquer the giants. Only two giants survived: Paiute and his wife, both of whose skin became brown from eternally living in the hot desert.&lt;ref name="Greene2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greene|first=Michael S|title=Nevada: A Journey of Discovery|year=2005|page=39|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Utah|isbn=1-58685-139-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adrienne Mayor]] writes about the Si-Te-Cah in her book, ''Legends of the First Americans''.&lt;ref name="Mayor2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayor|first=Adrienne|title=Fossil legends of the first Americans|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J|isbn=0-691-11345-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She suggests that the 'giant' interpretation of the skeletons from Lovelock Cave and other dry caves in Nevada was started by entrepreneurs setting up tourist displays and that the skeletons themselves were of normal size. However, about a hundred miles north of Lovelock there are plentiful fossils of mammoths and cave bears, and their large limb bones could easily be thought to be those of giants by an untrained observer. She also discusses the reddish hair, pointing out that hair pigment is not stable after death and that various factors such as temperature, soil, etc. can turn ancient very dark hair rusty red or orange.

[[Aztec mythology]] features the [[Quinametzin]], a race of giant men created in one of the previous [[Five Suns|solar eras]]. They are credited for the construction of [[Teotihuacan]].

=== Norse mythology ===
{{main| Jötunn}}
In [[Norse mythology]], the Jotun (''[[Jötunn|jötnar]]'' in [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]], a cognate with ''[[wikt:ettin|ettin]]'') are often opposed to the gods. While often translated as "giants", most are described as being roughly human sized. Some are portrayed as huge, such as frost giants (''hrímþursar''), fire giants (''eldjötnar''), and mountain giants (''bergrisar'').

The giants are the origin of most of various monsters in Norse mythology (e.g. the [[Fenrisulfr]]), and in the eventual battle of [[Ragnarök]] the giants will storm [[Asgard]] and fight them, until the world is destroyed. Even so, the gods themselves were related to the giants by many marriages, and there are giants such as [[Ægir]], [[Loki]], [[Mímir]], and [[Skaði]], who bear little difference in status to them. The Chief God [[Odin]] was the great-grand son of the Giant [[Ymir]].

Norse mythology also holds that the entire world of men was created from the flesh of Ymir, a giant of cosmic proportions, which name is considered by some to share a [[Root (linguistics)|root]] with the name [[Yama]] of Indo-Iranian mythology.

An old [[Iceland]]ic legend says that two night-prowling giants, a man and a woman, were traversing the fjord near [[Drangey]] Island with their cow when they were surprised by the bright rays of daybreak. As a result of exposure to daylight, all three were turned into stone. Drangey represents the cow and Kerling (supposedly the female giant, the name means "Old Hag") is to the south of it. Karl (the male giant) was to the north of the island, but he disappeared long ago.

A ''bergrisi'' – the traditional Protector of Southwestern Iceland – appears as a [[supporter]] on the [[coat of arms of Iceland]].

=== Roman mythology ===
[[File:Herakles Antaios Louvre G103.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hercules]] faces the giant [[Antaios]] in this illustration on a calix [[krater]], c. 515–510 BC.]]
Several [[Jupiter Column|Jupiter-Giant-Columns]] have been found in [[Germania Superior]]. These were crowned with a statue of Jupiter, typically on horseback, defeating or trampling down a Giant, often depicted as a snake. They are restricted to the area of south-western Germany, western Switzerland, French Jura and Alsace.

=== Other European mythology ===
[[File:Walter Crane King Arthur and the Giant Book I, Canto VIII.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[King Arthur]] faces a giant in this engraving by [[Walter Crane]].]]
In [[folklore]] from all over Europe, giants were believed to have built the remains of previous civilizations.  [[Saxo Grammaticus]], for example, argues that giants had to exist, because nothing else would explain the large walls, stone monuments, and statues that we now know were the remains of [[ancient Rome|Roman]] construction. Similarly, the [[Old English poetry|Old English poem]] ''[[The Seafarer (poem)|Seafarer]]'' speaks of the high stone walls that were the work of giants.  Even natural geologic features such as the massive [[basalt]] columns of the [[Giant's Causeway]] on the coast of [[Northern Ireland]] were attributed to construction by giants.  Giants provided the least complicated explanation for such artifacts.

Medieval romances such as the Spanish ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'' feature giants as antagonists, or, rarely, as allies. This is parodied famously in Cervantes' ''[[Don Quixote]]'', when the title character attacks a windmill, believing it to be a giant. This is the source of the phrase [[tilting at windmills]].

Tales of combat with giants were a common feature in the folklore of [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]].  Celtic giants also figure in [[Breton literature|Breton]] and [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] perhaps as a reflection of the Nordic and Slavic mythology that arrived on the boats, and from this source they spread into the heroic tales of [[Torquato Tasso]], [[Ludovico Ariosto]], and their follower [[Edmund Spenser]].  In the small [[Scotland|Scottish]] village of [[Kinloch Rannoch]], a local myth to this effect concerns a local hill that apparently resembles the head, shoulders, and torso of a man, and has therefore been termed 'the sleeping giant'. Apparently the giant will awaken only if a specific musical instrument is played near the hill. Other giants, perhaps descended from earlier Germanic mythology, feature as frequent opponents of [[Dietrich von Bern]] in medieval German tales – in later portrayals Dietrich himself and his fellow heroes also became giants.

Many giants in English folklore were noted for their stupidity.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|p=63}}  A giant who had quarreled with the Mayor of Shrewsbury went to bury the city with dirt; however, he met a shoemaker, carrying shoes to repair, and the shoemaker convinced the giant that he had worn out all the shoes coming from Shrewsbury, and so it was too far to travel.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|p=64}}

Other English stories told of how giants threw stones at each other.  This was used to explain many great stones on the landscape.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|p=65}}

Giants figure in a great many fairy tales and folklore stories, such as ''[[Jack the Giant Killer]]'', ''[[The Giant Who Had No Heart in His Body]]'', ''[[Nix Nought Nothing]]'', ''[[Robin Hood and the Prince of Aragon]]'', ''[[Young Ronald]]'', and [[Paul Bunyan (lumberjack)|Paul Bunyan]]. [[Ogre]]s and [[troll]]s are humanoid creatures, sometimes of gigantic stature, that occur in various sorts of European folklore. An example of another, Slavic, folklore giant is [[Rübezahl]], a kind giant from [[Wendish folklore]] who lived in the [[Krkonoše|Giant Mountains]] (nowadays on the [[Czech Republic|Czech]]–[[Poland|Polish]] border). Additionally, mythological beings which are not necessarily considered giants in the common sense can be characterized by a giant-like body size, e.g. the [[Bergmönch]], a [[German folklore|German]] mountain spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Grimm, Jacob Grimm: ''Deutsche Sagen''. Hamburg 2014, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kalevala]], [[Antero Vipunen]] is a giant shaman that possesses mighty spells dating to the creation. Epic hero [[Väinämöinen]] sets out to learn these spells from him, but Vipunen is buried underground, and when Väinämöinen digs him out, he is accidentally swallowed by Vipunen. Väinämöinen then forces Vipunen to submit and sing the spells out by hammering his insides. An analysis by Martti Haavio is that Vipunen is not physically large, but his [[familiar animal]] (astral form) is a [[whale]]. The depiction is not found in the majority of Finnish original stories, and most probably originates from the book's compiler [[Elias Lönnrot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parkkinen.org/vipunen.html|title=Väinämöinen ja Antero Vipunen|work=parkkinen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alleged fossil evidence ==
Through the centuries, certain archaeologists have searched for fossil evidence of a race of giants. Alleged evidence includes:
* The [[Giant of Castelnau]]: Estimated at 11 feet 6 inches (3.5&amp;nbsp;m) tall.

The term '''groupie''' is a slang word in reference to a fan of a particular [[musician]], [[celebrity]], or [[Musical ensemble|musical group]] who follows this person or band around while they are on tour or who attends as many of their public appearances as possible, usually in hopes of getting to know them more. The term is almost universally used to describe young women who follow these individuals in hopes of establishing a sexual relationship with them or offering themselves for sex.

==Origin in music==
{{refimprove section|date = August 2017}}
The word ''groupie'' originated around 1965 to describe teen-aged girls or young women who sought brief liaisons with musicians. The phenomenon was much older; [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]] had earlier described it in her novel ''[[The Company She Keeps (novel)|The Company She Keeps]]'' (1942).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tz5YpijuksC&amp;pg=PA237 |page=237 |title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Performance and production |publisher=A&amp;C Black |year=2003 |isbn=9780826463210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources have attributed the coining of the word to [[the Rolling Stones]] bassist [[Bill Wyman]] during the group's 1965 Australian tour;&lt;ref&gt;Leah Pickett, [http://www.wbez.org/blogs/leah-pickett/2013-08/groupies-past-and-present-muses-behind-music-108266 "Groupies, past and present: the muses behind the music"], [[WBEZ]], August 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; but Wyman said he and his bandmates used other "code words" for women on tour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Wyman]], ''Bill Wyman, Stone Alone: The Story of a Rock 'n' Roll Band'' ([[Da Capo Press]], 1997), {{ISBN|978-0306807831}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zi79b9a2o0sC&amp;lpg=PA294&amp;dq=groupie%20%22bill%20wyman%22&amp;pg=PA294 p. 294].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trevor groupie.jpg|thumb|Trevor Middleton with a groupie]]
A prominent explanation of the ''groupie'' concept came from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, which published an issue devoted to the topic, ''Groupies: The Girls of Rock'' (February 1969), which emphasized the sexual behavior of rock musicians and groupies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Electric Ladyland: Women and Rock Culture |first=Lisa L. |last=Rhodes |year=2005 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |pages=156–176 |isbn=9780812238402}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]]'' published an article, "Manners And Morals: The Groupies", later that month. Also that year, British journalist Jenny Fabian and Johnny Byrne released a largely autobiographical book called ''Groupie'' (1969). The following year, a documentary film titled ''Groupies'' (1970) was released.

Female groupies in particular have a long-standing reputation of being available to celebrities, pop stars, rock stars and other public figures. [[Led Zeppelin]] singer [[Robert Plant]] is quoted as distinguishing between fans who wanted [[Casual sex|brief]] sexual encounters, and "groupies" who traveled with musicians for extended periods of time, acting as a surrogate girlfriend, and often taking care of the musician's wardrobe and social life.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Stephen. ''Hammer of the Gods: The Led Zeppelin Saga'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Women who adopt this role are sometimes referred to as "'''road wives'''". [[Cynthia Plaster Caster]], [[Cleo Odzer]], [[Barbara Cope]] ("The Butter Queen") and [[The GTOs]] ("Girls Together Outrageously"), with [[Pamela Des Barres]], in particular, as de facto spokeswoman, are probably the best known groupies of this type.

Musician [[Frank Zappa]] organized "[[The GTOs]]" in the late 1960s. The band comprised seven young women&amp;nbsp;— Miss Pamela (Pamela Des Barres), Miss Sparky (Linda Sue Parker), Miss Lucy (Lucy McLaren), Miss Christine (Christine Frka), Miss Sandra (Sandra Leano), Miss Mercy (Mercy Fontentot), and Miss Cynderella (Cynthia Cale-Binion).

A characteristic that may classify one as a groupie is a reputation for promiscuity. [[Connie Hamzy]], also known as "Sweet Connie", a prominent groupie in the 1960s, argues in favor of the groupie movement and defends her chosen lifestyle by saying, "Look we're not hookers, we loved the glamour". However, her openness regarding her sexual endeavors with various rock stars is exactly what has enhanced the negative connotations surrounding her type. For example, she stated in the ''Los Angeles Times'' article "Pop &amp; Hiss" (December 15, 2010): "Hamzy, unlike the other groupies, was never looking to build relationships. She was after sex, and she unabashedly shared intimate moments with virtually every rock star&amp;nbsp;— even their roadies&amp;nbsp;— who came through Arkansas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Gerrick|title=Pop &amp; Hiss|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/12/im-with-the-band-rocks-most-famous-groupies-tell-all-for-vh1-documentary.html|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Des Barres, who wrote two books detailing her experiences as a groupie – ''I'm With The Band'' (1987)&lt;ref&gt;[[Pamela Des Barres]] (1987). [https://books.google.com/books?id=bmyW7ns3ycgC ''I'm with the Band: Confessions of a Groupie''], Books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Take Another Little Piece of My Heart: A Groupie Grows Up'' (1993)&lt;ref&gt;[[Pamela Des Barres]] (1992). [https://books.google.com/books?id=vVBgCeQ7G5EC ''Take Another Little Piece of My Heart: A Groupie Grows Up''], Books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt; – as well as another non-fiction book, ''Rock Bottom: Dark Moments in Music Babylon'', asserts that a groupie is to a rock band as [[Mary Magdalene]] was to [[Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', [http://google.com/search?q=cache:jYR3T4urbUQJ:www.amazon.com/Lets-Spend-Night-Together-Supergroupies/dp/1556527896+%22Pamela+Des+barres%22+groupie+rock+%22mary+magdalene%22+jesus&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;ie=UTF-8 Review of ''Let's Spend the Night Together''] on [[Amazon.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; Her most recent book, ''Let's Spend the Night Together'' (2007), is a collection of wildly varied interviews with classic "old school" groupies including Catherine James, [[Connie Hamzy]], [[Cherry Vanilla]], DeeDee Keel, [[Margaret Moser]], as well as 80s and 90s groupies including Pleasant Gehman, Patti Johnsen. Des Barres described Keel as: "One of the most intimidating dolls&amp;nbsp;... a slim strawberry blonde who won the highly prized job of [[Whisky a Go Go|Whisky]] office manager after her predecessor [[Gail Zappa|Gail Sloatman]] met Frank Zappa and became what we all wanted to be." Keel was one of the few who stayed connected in Hollywood and with bands for nearly three decades. Des Barres, who married rock singer/actor [[Michael Des Barres]], also persuaded cult actress [[Tura Satana]], singer and model [[Bebe Buell]], actress [[Patti D'Arbanville]], and [[Cassandra Peterson]], better known as "Elvira, Mistress of the Dark" to talk about their relationships with musicians.

Also according to Des Barres' book,{{which|date=May 2015}} there is at least one male groupie, Pleather, who followed female celebrities such as [[Courtney Love]] and members of the 1980s pop group [[the Bangles]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Space program==
During the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] space programs, women would hang around the hotels of [[Clear Lake City (Greater Houston)|Clear Lake]] and [[Cocoa Beach, Florida|Cocoa Beach]] "collecting" astronauts. Joan Roosa, wife of [[Apollo 14]] Lunar Module Pilot [[Stuart Roosa|Stu Roosa]], recalled, "I was at a party one night in Houston. A woman standing behind me, who had no idea who I was, said 'I've slept with every astronaut who has been to the Moon.'&amp;nbsp;... I said 'Pardon me, but I don't think so.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Sports==
Groupies also play a role in sports. For example, "buckle bunnies" are a well-known part of the world of [[rodeo]].&lt;ref name="gauthier2000"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Gauthier| first=D. K.|author2=C.

Forsyth|title=Buckle bunnies: groupies of the rodeo circuit| journal=[[Deviant Behavior (journal)|Deviant Behavior]]| year=2000| volume=21|issue=4| pages=349–365}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term comes from a slang term for women ("bunnies"), and from the prize belt [[Belt buckle|buckle]]s awarded to the winners in rodeo, which are highly sought by the bunnies.&lt;ref&gt;Gwen Florio, "Whoa There, Little Lady, Eyes Forward: Cowgirls Can't Help Staring At Size Of A Cowboy's Buckle." ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', January 15, 2005. Copy available [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-127142331.html here] {{Subscription required}} ("Rodeo cowboys might jealously compare the length of their rides, but for the women who love them, it's all about a real big buckle. Emphasis on real&amp;nbsp;... A dedicated 'buckle bunny' (sounds so much nicer than 'groupie') can tell at a glance who's gone the distance and who's never even gotten out of the chutes.")&lt;/ref&gt; According to one report, bunnies "usually do not expect anything more than sex from the rodeo participants and vice versa".&lt;ref name="gauthier2000" /&gt;

In a 1994 ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine feature, [[Elizabeth Gilbert]] characterized buckle bunnies as an essential element of the rodeo scene, and described a particularly dedicated group of bunnies who are known on the rodeo circuit for their supportive attitude and generosity, going beyond sex, to "some fascination with providing the most macho group of guys on Earth with the only brand of nurturing they will accept".&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Gilbert]], "Buckle Bunnies", ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', September 1994, pp.78ff.

Recently, in Irish sport, particularly in GAA sports the term "Jersey Puller" or "Jersey Tugger" has been used to describe females who are interested in players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/woman/celeb-news/jersey-pullers-on-the-hunt-for-stray-players-29471129.html |title=Jersey pullers on the hunt for stray players |website=Independent.ie |date=2013-08-04 |access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to the pulling of a player's top. The term can range from who look to be romantically linked with senior intercounty players to local players playing for their parish.{{Citation needed|date = August 2017}}

====Groupies====
*[[The GTOs]] ("Girls Together Outrageously"), is a band organized by [[Frank Zappa]] in the late 1960s, composed of seven groupies: Miss Pamela [[Pamela Des Barres]] (de facto spokeswoman), Miss Sparky (Linda Sue Parker), Miss Lucy (Lucy McLaren), Miss Christine (Christine Frka), Miss Sandra (Sandra Leano), Miss Mercy (Mercy Fontentot), and Miss Cynderella (Cynthia Cale-Binion)

====Songs====
*The song "[[Apple Scruffs (song)|Apple Scruffs]]", from [[George Harrison]]'s album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' (1970), refers to the "[[Apple scruffs]]", a group of teenage girls who staked out [[the Beatles]]' [[Apple Corps]] offices, [[Abbey Road Studios]], and Paul McCartney's home, often sleeping outside in rough weather, waiting for a glimpse of a Beatle. The Beatles' song "[[She Came in Through the Bathroom Window]]" refers to the day a few Scruffs climbed into [[Paul McCartney]]'s house through an upstairs bathroom window and raided his closet for a pair of [[trousers]], which they took turns wearing. They also took a framed photograph, which they later returned at McCartney's request.

The song was covered by [[Carpenters]], who changed the title to "Superstar" and changed the lyric "I can hardly wait to sleep with you again" to "I can hardly wait to be with you again."
*[[Grand Funk Railroad]] recorded their song, "We're An American Band," which included the line "Sweet, sweet Connie was doing her act/She had the whole show and that's a natural fact." This lyric is referring to groupie Connie Hamzy.
*[[Dr. Hook &amp; the Medicine Show]] recorded the novelty song "Roland the Roadie and Gertrude the Groupie."
*The song "[[Star Star]]" by [[The Rolling Stones]] from their [[Goats Head Soup]] album is an infamous, profanity-laden song that speaks candidly of the groupie scene of the early '70s. Despite the title, it is widely known as "Starfucker", which is chanted throughout the song.
*The song "Groupie Love" by [[Lana Del Rey]], featuring [[ASAP Rocky|A$AP Rocky]] off her [[Lust for Life (Lana Del Rey album)|Lust for Life]] album, connotes the relationship between an artist with a type of fan—usually a young woman which seeks for emotional or sexual intimacy, involved in obsessive adoration of entertainers such as musicians, actors, athletes, and even political figures.
*The song "Famous Groupies" by the band [[Wings]] on the album [[London Town (Wings album)]] tells about a pair of groupies and the damage they leave behind.
*The song "[[Sick Again]]" by the band [[Led Zeppelin]] on their 1975 album [[Physical Graffiti]] is about the L.A. Groupie Scene in the early 1970s.

=== Television ===
* In ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'', the groupies who hang around the fictional SOA motorcycle club are referred to as "Crow Eaters"; in [[Sons of Anarchy (season 6)|season 6]], [[Jax Teller|Jax]]'s ex-wife Wendy told [[Tara Knowles|Tara]], Margaret, and Lowen she was a "Crow Eater" for a year before marrying Jax.

'''Ingeborg Beling''' was a German [[Ethology|ethologist]] from the early 20th century who worked in the field of [[chronobiology]]. She studied at the [[University of Munich]] under the direction of [[Karl Von Frisch]] and is known for her research on the time sense of [[honey bee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Seymour. The Secret Clocks: Time Senses of Living Things. New York: The Viking Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://biology4.wustl.edu/faculty/herzog/BioTiming%20Tutorial/historical.html Biotiming Tutorial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530194304/http://biology4.wustl.edu/faculty/herzog/BioTiming%20Tutorial/historical.html |date=2010-05-30 }}. Ed. Erik Herzog. Department of Biology, Washington University, n.d. Web. 12 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
In her research, in 1929, she trained bees to come to a feeding station at a specific time of day, day after day.&lt;ref name="belingpaper"&gt;Beling, Ingeborg. "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00340159 Über das Zeitgedächtnis der Bienen]." Zeitschrift fur vergleichende Physiologie 9.2 (1929): 259-338. Print. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kung, Shain-Dow, and Shang-Fa Yang. Discoveries in Plant Biology Volume 1. Singapore: World Scientific Publishing Company, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This contribution ultimately led to the discovery of the bees’ 24-hour [[circadian rhythm|biological clock]]. Because of this achievement, she was regarded as one of the first female chronobiologists.  Beyond honeybees, much of Beling’s work involved studying behaviors of [[wasp]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Beling, Ingeborg. "Zur Biologic und Zucht der Schlupfwespe Angilia armil-lata." Arb biol Reichsanst Berlin. 20. (1933): 237-244. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; fly pupae,&lt;ref&gt;Beling, Ingeborg. "Ueber missgebildete Fliegenpuppen."Zoologischer Anzeiger Leipzig. 87. (1930): 171-175. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; etc. Finally, she also did some research in pest control.&lt;ref&gt;Beling, Ingeborg. "Biologische Mitteilungen." Naturwissenschaften 19.27 (1931): 
599-600.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beling, Ingeborg. "Schädlingsbekämpfung im 18. Jahrhundert." Anzeiger für Schädlingskunde 8.6 (1932): 66-69&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bee-feeding experiment (1929) ==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bees Entrained by Beling.png|250px|thumbnail|right|A figure in Beling's original publication, which illustrates that bees showed up at the feeding dish only at the trained time. The black box indicates the trained time ("Dressaurzeit"). Note that some bees appeared a little early before the trained time, indicating anticipation of food.&lt;ref name="belingpaper"/&gt;]] --&gt;
Beling wrote in her widely cited 1929 paper, titled "''Über das Zeitgedächtnis der Bienen''"  (“On the Time Memory of Bees”) published in the Journal of Comparative Physiology, that the early observations of [[Auguste Forel|Forel]], [[:es: Hugo Berthold von Buttel-Reepen|v. Buttel-Reepen]] and Dobkiewicz promoted her to study the intriguing behavior of bees, termed ''Zeitgedächtnis'', or time memory.&lt;ref name="belingpaper"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beling, Ingeborg. "Über das Zeitgedächtnis der Bienen." Die Naturwissenschaften (1930): 63-67&lt;/ref&gt;  In her pioneer experiments, Beling trained a group of individually marked foraging bees to fly to a feeding dish, which was filled with sugar water only at certain times of the day (for example, between 4 and 6 PM). During the testing phase, the dish was empty throughout the day and every visiting bee was recorded. She found that the bees only visited the feeding station at trained time, even when the sugar water was removed. Specifically, Beling found that the bees can anticipate the food by showing up just a little early every morning. Further more, she found that bees could be trained to show up at the feeding station at any time of the day, and even for multiple times a day. However, Beling did report that the bees could only be trained to a period close to 24 hours, but not 19 or 48 hours as she tested. These results were still present when Beling controlled potential environmental cues such as humidity, temperature, light and radiation.

== Contributions to chronobiology ==
Beling was able to show that bees have an astonishing memory of time. She found that this time memory is both rigorous (the bees consistently show up at the expected time) and flexible (the bees can be trained to show up any time of night or day, even two or three times a day). Beling found that bees could only train to periods close to 24 hours. This [[circadian rhythm|24-hour rhythm]] in bees has biological significance in that it is evolutionarily advantageous, helping the bees coordinate with flowers when they are gathering nectar and helping them avoid flying at dangerous predator-filled times of day.&lt;ref name = "renner"&gt;Renner, Max. "The Contribution of the Honey Bee to the Study of Time-Sense and Astronomical Orientation." Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol 25 (1960): 361-67.&lt;/ref&gt; The bees' anticipation of the feeding is also advantageous - by knowing the time of day, the bees can prepare themselves for the meal and enable a faster response.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Martin. "[http://jap.physiology.org/content/107/4/1339.full Anticipating anticipation: pursuing identification of cardiomyocyte circadian clock function]." Journal of Applied Physiology. 107.4 (2009): 1339-1347. Web. 23 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beling’s research was unable to conclusively show whether bees have some kind of internal [[circadian rhythm|biological clock]] that is controlling this behavior or if there is some external cue acting as a [[Zeitgeber]] that she did not account for in her experiments.

==Related terms==
Much of the early work in chronobiology was done in Germany, so publications were largely written in German. Some terms created at this time are still being used or often referred to today. The father of chronobiology, [[Colin Pittendrigh]], critiqued these terms, saying that researchers in Munich have trouble letting go of these terms. He argues that ‘training’ and ‘memory’ do not capture the innate components of the behavior.&lt;ref name="PittenPaper"&gt;Colin Pittendrigh. "Temporal Organization: Reflections of a Darwinian Clock-Watcher" Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993 55:17-54

==Related chronobiologists ==

Beling was one of the earliest chronobiologists who studied the rhythms of bees. Her work grew from the observations of previous scientists (Forel, Buttel-Reepen, von Frisch) and helped inspire further experimentation (Wahl, Renner). Standing on the shoulders of these researchers, Pittendrigh took the field of chronobiology to the modern era by studying biological clocks in [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] and is regarded as the father of modern chronobiology.

[[Colonel]] '''Josiah Clement Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100|DSO|PC|DL|commas=on}} (16 March 1872 &amp;ndash; 26 July 1943), sometimes referred to as '''Josiah Wedgwood IV''', was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[politician]] who served in government under [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. He was a prominent [[Georgism|single-tax]] activist following the political-economic reformer [[Henry George]].  He was the great-great-grandson of the famous potter [[Josiah Wedgwood]].

==Biography==
Josiah Wedgwood was born at [[Barlaston]] in [[Staffordshire]], the son of [[Clement Wedgwood]].  He was the great-great-grandson of the potter [[Josiah Wedgwood]].  His mother Emily Catherine was the daughter of the engineer [[James Meadows Rendel (engineer)|James Meadows Rendel]].  He was educated at [[Clifton College]] and then studied at the [[Royal Naval College (Greenwich)|Royal Naval College]], [[Greenwich]].

He [[cousin marriage|married his first cousin]] Ethel Kate Bowen (1869–1952), daughter of Sir [[Charles Bowen, 1st Baron Bowen]] in 1894 but she left him in 1913 and divorced him in 1919.  Since divorce at that time required a guilty party, he agreed to take the blame and was found guilty of adultery and desertion of his wife and children.  This led to criticism from the press and pulpit.  More criticism was levelled after the divorce was final and he revealed that the desertion was a formality and the adultery staged.  They had seven children:

*Helen Bowen Wedgwood (1895–1981), married the geneticist [[Michael Pease]], son of [[Edward Reynolds Pease]].  One of their sons was the physicist [[Bas Pease]] and one of their daughters, Jocelyn Richenda Gammell Pease (1925–2003), married [[Andrew Huxley]], the biologist.
*Rosamund Wedgwood (1896–1960)
*[[Francis Charles Bowen Wedgwood, 2nd Baron Wedgwood|Francis Charles Bowen Wedgwood]] (1898–1959), 2nd Baron Wedgwood. He was father of the 3rd Baron.
*[[Josiah Wedgwood V]] (1899–1968), managing director of Wedgwood. He was father of Dr [[John Wedgwood (doctor)|John Wedgwood]] (1919–2007), former heir presumptive to the barony.
*[[Camilla Wedgwood|Camilla Hildegarde Wedgwood]] (1901–1955), anthropologist
*Elizabeth Julia Wedgwood (1907–1993)
*Gloria Wedgwood (1909–1974)

In 1919 he remarried; his second wife was Florence Ethel Willett (1878–1969).

==Military and political career==
[[File:Josiah Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood.jpg|thumb|Wedgwood outside parliament in 1911]]
Proficient in [[mathematics]], he joined the workshops of an arms manufacturer, Elswick. He worked for a year from 1895 as an Assistant Naval Constructor in [[Portsmouth]] before returning to [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] to head the drawing office of another arms manufacturer, [[William George Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|Armstrong]]. Following the outbreak of the [[Second Boer War]] in late 1899 he was given the army rank of [[Captain (BARM)|captain]] on 3 March 1900,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27170 |page=1434| date=2 March 1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for three years commanded a volunteer battery of the [[Royal Field Artillery]] equipped by Elswick. He remained in [[South Africa]] after the war, spending two years as a Resident [[Magistrate]] in the district of [[Ermelo, Mpumalanga|Ermelo]] in the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. His studies of native land laws gave him an interest in [[Land Reform]]. Influenced by the writings of [[Georgism|Henry George]], he developed a lifelong belief in the [[Land Value Tax|Single Tax]], advocating a tax on property to replace taxes on income and goods as a way of securing for workers the full reward for their work. He became president of the League for the Taxation of Land Values in 1908.

Having returned to [[England]], Wedgwood was elected as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Newcastle-under-Lyme (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle-under-Lyme]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906 general election]]. Though he stood for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], he made it clear that he would take an independent line in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] if necessary, in accordance with his conscience. He was re-elected at both the [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|January]] and [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|December 1910]] elections, and that year was also elected to Staffordshire [[County Council]], remaining a Councillor until 1918. He became disillusioned with the Liberals after 1910, when it became clear that the government would not honour campaign commitments to land reform and opposing vested interests. His disillusionment was increased by the government's reaction against the [[Suffragette]]s, whom he also supported. In 1913 he staged a [[filibuster]] against the government's Mental Deficiency Bill, which he saw as authoritarian and unjust. Over the course of two days in Parliament, he tabled 120 amendments and made 150 speeches in Parliament, sustaining himself with only [[barley-water]] and [[chocolate]] according to press reports, until his voice gave out. This campaign brought him to public attention outside of his own constituency and the Land Reform movement, and he became known as a leading backbencher.

===World War I===
Following the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], he volunteered for service with the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]], holding the rank of [[Lieutenant commander (Royal Navy)|lieutenant-commander]]. He returned to mechanical work and was posted with the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] and Armoured Cars. He served in [[France]] in 1914 and was wounded in the [[Dardanelles Campaign]] in 1915, receiving the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his service during the [[landing at Cape Helles]] on the [[SS River Clyde|SS ''River Clyde'']]. It was while serving there that he met volunteers of the [[Zion Mule Corps]] commanded by [[Joseph Trumpeldor]] that would affect his views about British policy on [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Murray S. &amp; Hochstein, Joseph M., ''Jews' Secret Fleet'', Gefen Publishing House, Jerusalem, 2010, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; Back in Parliament he expressed concern at under-staffing and support for [[national service]], though he also defended the rights of [[conscientious objector]]s. Later that year he was posted as an army captain to the staff of General [[Jan Smuts]] in [[East Africa]]. In 1916 he was part of the [[Special Commissions (Dardanelles and Mesopotamia) Act 1916|Mesopotamia Commission of Inquiry]].

Promoted to Major he commanded a Machine Gun company in the 2nd South African Infantry Brigade in 1916. In 1917 he became Assistant Director of Trench Warfare with the rank of Colonel. At the start of 1918 he was sent to [[Siberia]] where his mission was to encourage continued Russian participation in the war and to gathering intelligence on [[Bolshevik]] control in Siberia.

===1918 General Election===
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 General Election]] he sought re-election. There has been some confusion regarding his specific affiliation at the time of the election. He was officially supported by his local Liberal Association and he was officially endorsed by the Coalition Government. This led to him being described in many sources at the time as a Coalition Liberal. However, during the election campaign he publicly distanced himself from the Coalition Government. His own local election campaign was minimal because he was not opposed. In his election address he stated "I come before you, the same impenitent independent radical that you first elected in 1906".&lt;ref&gt;The Last of the Radicals by CV Wedgwood&lt;/ref&gt; This had led some to incorrectly describe him in 1918 as an 'Independent Radical' even though in 1906 he was classified as a 'Liberal'. The usually reliable FWS Craig, in his book the British parliamentary election results, 1918-1949 described him as an 'Independent Liberal'. However his status as an official Liberal rather than an Independent Liberal was subsequently confirmed when he attended the first meeting of the Liberal parliamentary party on 3 February 1919.&lt;ref&gt;The Downfall of the Liberal Party by Trevor Wilson&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joining Labour===
In 1919, Wedgwood took the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[whip (politics)|whip]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and joined the [[Independent Labour Party]]. He enjoyed the freer atmosphere of Labour and the party warmly welcomed him, electing him joint Vice-Chairman of the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] in 1921. Wedgwood maintained his reputation for championing new ideas and the interests of outsiders and underdogs. He supported a number of unpopular causes, including opposition to the reparations from Germany contained in the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. In 1920 he criticised the government's partition of [[Mandatory Palestine|British territories]] into Palestine and Transjordan, and continued to attack what he saw as its bias against [[Zionism]] for the next two decades. That year he also led a commission from the Labour Party and the [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] to [[Hungary]], which reported on the extremely brutal treatment of suspected communists under the new authoritarian regime. He supported refugee causes in Britain, particularly that of anarchists from the [[Soviet Union]], such as [[Emma Goldman]]. Most of all he became known for his support of the [[Indian independence movement]].

===Cabinet and the Lords===
[[File:1924_Josiah_Wedgwood.jpg|thumb|right|Josiah Wedgwood]]
There was tacit co-operation between Labour and the opposition Liberals in some seats at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923 general election]], and Wedgwood ran unopposed in Newcastle-under-Lyme. Having been re-elected Vice-Chairman of the party in 1922 and 1923, Wedgwood expected a seat in the Cabinet when Labour formed its first government at the start of 1924. There was speculation in the press that he would be made [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] and some expectation that he would become [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] or for [[Secretary of State for India|India]]. [[Sidney Webb]] believed Wedgwood would prefer to become [[President of the Board of Trade]], and was willing to step aside in his favour. However, [[Ramsay MacDonald]] initially offered him only the junior position of Financial [[Secretary to the Treasury]]. After some pressing, MacDonald gave him a seat in the Cabinet, but with the sinecure title of [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] rather than a departmental portfolio. In this capacity, he performed various de facto tasks in government. Later in the year, he was appointed Chief Industrial Commissioner, succeeding [[Arthur Henderson]] in a difficult position as the government's decision to maintain some of its predecessor's policies on industrial action caused much friction within the Labour movement. He was sworn into the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in 1924.

He chaired a Cabinet Committee to contemplate the use of the Emergency Powers Act against strikes in the transport industry. He took a strong line on a number of issues, opposing disarmament and the promise of a loan to the Soviet Union. He was also wary of the state undertaking [[public works]] purely for the sake of doing so, without any utilitarian benefit.

After the fall of the government, Wedgwood publicly criticised MacDonald's leadership and Labour's reliance on civil servants. He sat on Labour's front bench in opposition, speaking on, amongst other policy areas, local government, where he encouraged [[Clement Attlee]]. He was not offered a position in the second Labour government. In March 1929, he became chairman of the House of Commons Records Committee. He began compiling a history of the Commons, a subject that consumed his interest. He wrote a history of Staffordshire's parliamentary representatives from the thirteenth century to the First World War, and two volumes of biographies of MPs of the 15th century. Wedgwood's work in this area led eventually to the establishment of the [[History of Parliament]] Trust. Throughout the 1930s, he continued to speak in the Commons on issues of importance to him, particularly the Single Tax and native resistance to colonialism. In 1930 and 1931 he was made Mayor of [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]] after successfully campaigning for the town to remain independent of Stoke-on-Trent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newcastle-staffs.gov.uk/council_content.asp?id=SXCC-A780AB81&amp;cat=1192|title= Mayors from 1900 to Present|publisher= Newcastle Borough Council|accessdate= 31 July 2014|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140728215032/http://www.newcastle-staffs.gov.uk/council_content.asp?id=SXCC-A780AB81&amp;cat=1192|archivedate= 28 July 2014|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-1930s he was critical of [[appeasement]] and of limitations on the migration of Jews to Palestine ([[1939 White Paper]]) and of German refugees to Britain and worked tirelessly to help European Jews. The actor [[Heinz Bernard]]'s life was saved as a result of a [[parliamentary question]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1939/jul/06/refugees REFUGEES. (Hansard, 6 July 1939)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; asked by Wedgwood which resulted in his being given a visa to Britain.

In the [[Second World War]], he joined the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] in 1940. In 1941 he toured the [[United States of America]], putting Britain's case against [[Germany]] at public meetings. Whilst Wedgwood was in America, [[Winston Churchill]] offered him a [[peerage]], inviting him to sit for Labour in the [[House of Lords]]. Wedgwood accepted, [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning as MP]] for Newcastle-under-Lyme after 36 years and becoming '''Baron Wedgwood''', of [[Barlaston]] in the [[County of Stafford]] on 21 January 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35431 |date=23 January 1942 |page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he died in [[London]] at age of 71.

==Zionist activism==
In October 1926, Wedgwood, a devoted [[Zionist]], visited Palestine and challenged the Mandatory government's anti-Jewish stance. In ''The Seventh Dominion'' he accused the British administration of hindering the country's social and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13531049008575970?journalCode=fjih19 Josaih Wedgwood and the seventh dominion scheme, Joshua b. Stein]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and commemoration==
*Wedgwood Memorial College, a residential college founded in [[Stoke-on-Trent]] in 1945 was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://barlaston.org.uk/history/wedgwood.htm Wedgwood Memorial College] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106162509/http://www.barlaston.org.uk/history/wedgwood.htm |date= 6 January 2009 }} Barlaston Online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youngest popes==
The information to determine the age of the youngest [[pope]]s upon election is frequently unavailable, as many popes have completely unknown dates of birth. The probable youngest popes are:
*[[Pope Benedict IX]] (born in 1012) (pope three times finally ending in 1048, who became pope at the age of 20)
*[[Pope John XI]] (931–935, who was 20 at the beginning of his papacy)
*[[Pope Gregory V]] (996–999, who was 24 at the beginning of his papacy)

All three were members of the [[Counts of Tusculum|Theophylacti family]] that dominated Roman politics during the 10th century. This period is known to historians as the [[saeculum obscurum]].

'''Madame Montour''' (1667 or c. 1685 – c. 1753) was an interpreter, diplomat, and local leader of [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] and [[French Canadian]] ancestry. Although she was well known, her contemporaries usually referred to her only as "[[Madam]]e" or "[[Mrs.]]" Montour. She may have been Isabelle (or Elizabeth) Couc, a [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] born in 1667, or perhaps Isabelle Couc's niece, who was born around 1685 and whose given name is uncertain.

In 1711, Madame Montour began working as an interpreter and diplomatic consultant for the [[province of New York]]. Around 1727, she and her husband Carondawana, an [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]], moved to the [[province of Pennsylvania]]. Her village, known [[Loyalsock Creek#Village of Otstonwakin|Otstonwakin]], was at the mouth of [[Loyalsock Creek]] on the [[West Branch Susquehanna River]]. The modern borough of [[Montoursville, Pennsylvania|Montoursville]], named for her, developed on the east bank after the American Revolutionary War.

Montour's son [[Andrew Montour]] also became an important interpreter in Pennsylvania and Virginia, as did his son [[John Montour]]. Some of Madame Montour's female relatives were prominent local leaders in New York and Pennsylvania, and have often been confused with her by historians.

==Identity debate==
There has been confusion about details of Madame Montour's life. She has often been confounded with her female relatives, particularly [[Catharine Montour]], who was prominent in western New York. Historians have long attempted to separate fact from fiction and piece together her life from a few records and conflicting names.

Much is uncertain about Madame Montour's early life. In 1744, [[Witham Marshe]] met the "celebrated Mrs. Montour" at an important [[Treaty of Lancaster|treaty conference]] held in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Parmenter, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about her background, Montour told Marshe that she had been born in [[Canada, New France|Canada]] to a French father. She said that she had been captured by the [[Iroquois]] about fifty years earlier (i.e. around 1694), when she was about ten years old, and that she did not remember much about her parents. She had been adopted and raised by the Iroquois, she said. She eventually married Carondawana, an Oneida war chief, with whom she had several children before his death in battle in 1729.&lt;ref&gt;Parmenter, 141–42; Sivertsen, 94. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=EyoTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q=Montour&amp;f=false Witham Marshe's Journal], ''Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society'' (Boston, 1801), 1st series, 7:189–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, historian William A. Hunter tentatively identified Madame Montour as Elizabeth Couc, a métis born in 1667 near [[Trois-Rivières]], [[New France]], in what is now [[Quebec]], Canada. Elizabeth (also known as Isabelle, which was used interchangeably in French at the time) Couc was one of five children recorded for Pierre Couc ''dit'' Lafleur (1627–1690), a French-born [[fur trader]] and interpreter, and Marie Miteoamegoukoué (1631–1699), a Christian [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] woman.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 84; Sivertsen, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter conceded that some of the evidence connecting Madame Montour with Elizabeth Couc was "vague and contradictory".&lt;ref name = "DCB"&gt;{{cite DCB |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/couc_elizabeth_3E.html |title=Couc, Elizabeth |accessdate=2007-03-09 |first=William A. |last=Hunter |volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accepted that Madame Montour had been captured by an Iroquois war party around 1695, but if she was Elizabeth Couc, she was much older than ten at the time.

Hirsch and Sivertsen have explained the discrepancies by suggesting that Madame Montour was deliberately vague about her past; this allowed her to present a different account of herself in Pennsylvania as a genteel French woman, albeit one in Indian dress.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 96; Sivertsen, 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth (or Élisabeth) Couc apparently also used the name of Isabelle, the French form of Elizabeth; the two names were then interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 85n11.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Alison Duncan Hirsch uncovered a record from 1711 that lists payments to "Eysabelle Montour interpretress", the only known reference to Montour's first name in an English document.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabelle Couc presumably had an Algonquin name too, but it is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parmenter and Hagedorn are among contemporary historian who have argued that Madame Montour was not Isabelle Couc, but rather her niece.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Hanna, ''The Wilderness Trail'' (New York, 1911), 1:200, was perhaps the first to argue that Madame Montour was the daughter of Louis Couc, and thus Isabelle Couc's niece. Hagedorn (p. 44) and Parmenter (p. 143) support that view.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this interpretation, Montour was born in an Indian village near modern [[Sorel, Quebec]], around 1685, a year consistent with the story that she told Marshe. Her parents were [[Louis Montour|Louis Couc Montour]], who was the brother of Isabelle Couc, and Madeleine, a Sokoki (Western [[Abenaki]]) woman.&lt;ref&gt;Parmenter, 143–45; Hagedorn, 308n1.&lt;/ref&gt; If Madame Montour was born in 1685, her birth apparently went unrecorded, and her first name is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Parmenter, 147. Although Parmenter's article is entitled "Isabel Montour", in the text he says that her given name in unclear, and refers to her only as "Madame Montour".&lt;/ref&gt; Her given name has also been represented as Catherine, Elisabeth/Isabelle, and Madeleine.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
As pieced together by Hirsch, Madame Montour was Isabelle Couc and led an eventful life before beginning her career in New York as an interpreter for the British. In 1684, Couc married Joachim Germano, with whom she had at least one child.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1690s she was living in [[Michilimakinac]] (present-day Michigan) with two of her sisters and their husbands, who worked as interpreters in the fur trading center. Isabelle may also have worked as an interpreter for [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac|Sieur de Cadillac]], the local French commander. Cadillac would later claim that Isabelle led a "dissolute life", and had more than one hundred male lovers; some historians attribute his vitriol to some personal bias.&lt;ref name="Hirsch, 90"&gt;Hirsch, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; When Cadillac moved the French garrison to [[Fort Detroit]] in 1701, Isabelle evidently relocated there with her new husband, Pierre Tichenet. She became involved with [[Étienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont]]; when he deserted the fort in 1706, she fled with him.&lt;ref name="Hirsch, 90"/&gt; Her experience in the northwest territory gave her more exposure to a variety of Algonquian and Iroquois languages, increasing her facility in each.

Perhaps around 1708,&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 93n43&lt;/ref&gt; Madame Montour married an [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]] war captain named Carondawana. (If Madame Montour was instead the niece of Isabelle Couc, Carondawana was probably her only husband.) The couple had a son about 1720 named [[Andrew Montour]], who would become a well-known interpreter in Pennsylvania and Virginia. [[Iroquois kinship]] terms often described a woman's niece as her daughter, for example, so there is confusion about the identities of Madame Montour's other possible children.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 569.&lt;/ref&gt; Another boy, Lewis (Louis) Montour, was possibly her son, or perhaps her nephew.&lt;ref name="Parmenter, 147"&gt;Parmenter, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Montour|"French Margaret" Montour]], a woman often described as Madame Montour's daughter, may have been a niece.&lt;ref name="Hirsch, 97"&gt;Hirsch, 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the simplified family tree chart shown below, the names in green are the two women who have been identified as Madame Montour. Andrew Montour is connected on the chart to both of his potential mothers. Similarly, because it is uncertain if French Margaret was Madame Montour's daughter or niece, the chart illustrates both possibilities.

==Career in New York==
The first Montour to come to prominence was [[Louis Montour]], who was Madame Montour's brother or father. Born Louis Couc, he adopted "Montour" as his surname in the 1680s.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[King William's War]] (1689–1697), Montour and other Indians in Canada fought against British-allied [[Iroquois]] from the [[province of New York]]. At this time an Iroquois raiding party may have captured his daughter, who, according to some interpretations, became known as "Madame Montour".&lt;ref name="Parmenter, 143"&gt;Parmenter, 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Montour relocated to [[Michilimakinac]] in the 1690s, where he worked as a fur trader.&lt;ref name="Parmenter, 143"/&gt; After King William's War ended, he began to facilitate trade between western [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquians]] and merchants in [[Albany, New York]]. He accompanied the "Far Indians" to Albany. This lucrative enterprise diverted profits from New France to New York, and promoted diplomatic ties between the Iroquois and the western nations.&lt;ref&gt;Parmenter, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Officials in New France saw this as a threat. In 1709, during [[Queen Anne's War]], [[Governor Vaudreuil]] had Montour assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;Parmenter, 144–45. See also Daniel K. Richter, ''The Ordeal of the Longhouse: The Peoples of the Iroquois League in the Era of European Colonization'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1992), 224–25, where the man assassinated in 1709 is identified as "Alexander Montour, the son of a French officer and a Mohawk woman".&lt;/ref&gt;

After Louis Montour's murder, Madame Montour emerged as his successor, identified as Mountour's sister and benefiting from some of the trust accorded to him. Although she evidently could not read or write, she was valuable as an interpreter, able to speak French, English, and several languages in both the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] and [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian families]].&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 82n2, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; With family connections throughout the region, she was also an ideal cultural intermediary. According to historian Jon Parmenter, Madame Montour's role as a "behind the scenes" consultant was even more important than her work as an interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;Parmenter, 146-49.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Robert Hunter (governor)|Robert Hunter]] became governor of New York in 1710, Madame Montour became his personal interpreter and one of his most trusted advisers. They communicated in French. Her husband Carondawana took the English name "Robert Hunter" to honor the governor.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 94; Parmenter, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; He became "king" of the Algonquian-speaking Shawnee in Pennsylvania in 1714, and traveled between there and New York with Madame Montour for years, strengthening connections between them and the Iroquois.

Although Madame Montour served as an interpreter through the 1710s, there are few records of her activities at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Parmenter, 150; Hirsch, 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1719, she petitioned New York for back pay, although with Governor Hunter's departure in 1720, she may not have received it. According to historian Alison Duncan Hirsch, the wording of an official recommendation about Montour's salary "has been misread to mean that she was asking to be [[equal pay for women|paid the same as a man]]"; rather, she wanted the pay of an interpreter, which was higher than that of a common soldier.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point, Madame Montour and her family migrated to the [[province of Pennsylvania]]. Exactly when and why she moved is unclear. She may have been traveling between New York and Pennsylvania as early as 1714, when her husband Carondawana was appointed as the Iroquois spokesman for the [[Shawnee]] living in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Hirsch, 97"/&gt; By 1727, she and Carondawana were living at Otstonwakin, a village also known as Otstuagy or French Town.&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with the nearby French Margaret's Town; see John Franklin Meginness, ''Otzinachson: A History of the West Branch Valley of the Susquehanna'' (rev. ed., Williamsport, PA, 1889), 1:94. Ostonwakin is also spelled ''Otstonwakin''.&lt;/ref&gt; The site of previous Native American villages, Otstonwakin was located along the [[Great Shamokin Path]], at the important [[confluence (geography)|confluence]] of [[Loyalsock Creek]] with the [[West Branch Susquehanna River]], on the west bank of the river. The modern borough of [[Montoursville, Pennsylvania|Montoursville]] developed on the east bank after the American Revolutionary War.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of her cultural knowledge of Native American affairs and facility with both the Iroquoian and Algonquian language families, Montour was sought as an adviser by Pennsylvania officials and private traders. She first appears in the Pennsylvania historical record in July 1727 as an interpreter at a council in [[Philadelphia]] between Governor [[Patrick Gordon (governor)|Patrick Gordon]] and an Iroquois group.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Madame Montour and Carondawana had a close relationship with [[Shikellamy]], a noted Oneida diplomat who benefited from the couple's cultural and linguistic expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Parmenter, 152–53.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1729, Carondawana was killed fighting against the southern [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]], traditional foes of the Iroquois.&lt;ref&gt;Parmenter, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; After her husband's death, Madame Montour was gradually excluded from Pennsylvania diplomacy by Shikellamy and his colonial associate [[Conrad Weiser]], who wanted to keep tight control of the province's relationship with the Iroquois. After 1734, she no longer appeared at councils in an official capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Parmenter, 153–55.&lt;/ref&gt; She retired to her village, where she operated a trading post and supply depot, and raised her son [[Andrew Montour]] to be an interpreter and diplomat.&lt;ref name="Parmenter, 155"&gt;Parmenter, 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1740s, Madame Montour met several [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries who were evangelizing in Pennsylvania. Count [[Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf]], bishop of the Moravian Church, visited Otstonwakin in 1742 on his journey to [[Onondaga (village)|Onondaga]], the Iroquois capital in western New York.&lt;ref name="Hirsch, 105"&gt;Hirsch, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; He delivered a sermon in French, during which Madame Montour reportedly wept.&lt;ref name="Parmenter, 155"/&gt; Montour asked Zinzendorf to baptize two Indian children, but he declined, explaining that the Moravians did not perform baptisms in a village without first establishing a mission there. "She left me displeased", wrote Zinzendorf.&lt;ref name="Hirsch, 105"/&gt;

In 1744, Montour attended the conference for the [[treaty of Lancaster]], where she told her story to Witham Marshe, as described above. Marshe, like others, thought that Montour was a French woman captured by and raised among the Indians, rather than a métis of partial French ancestry. Historian Alison Duncan Hirsch has argued that the [[captivity narrative|captivity story]] Montour told to Marshe was a fiction she created to reinvent herself in Pennsylvania, claiming her father had been a governor of New France.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 96, 106–07.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1745, Madame Montour had left Otstonwakin and was living with her son Andrew on an island in the [[Susquehanna River]] near the Native village of [[Shamokin (village)|Shamokin]], which was settled by Delaware, Oneida and [[Siouan languages|Siouan]]-speaking Tutelo.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1746, Andrew took her west, across the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to [[Logstown]] on the [[Ohio River]]. She was reportedly going blind by that time. This was her last appearance in the historical record, aside from a brief statement made by trader [[John Harris Jr.|John Harris]] in January 1753: "Madame Montour is dead."&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt; Exactly when and where she died is unknown.

==Legacy==
[[File:West Branch Valley Scenic View.jpg|thumb|250px|Madame Mountour's village of Otstonwakin was located at the mouth of Loyalsock Creek on the West Branch Susquehanna River]]

Madame Montour has numerous descendants, and many Iroquois people still carry the Montour name.&lt;ref&gt;Parmenter, 156.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montoursville, Pennsylvania]], which was founded near the site of Otstonwakin, was named for her.&lt;ref name="donehoo"&gt;{{cite book|last=Donehoo |first=Dr. George P. |title=A History of the Indian Villages and Place Names in Pennsylvania |origyear=1928 |url=http://www.srbc.net/docs/IndianNamesDataChart.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-03-07 |edition=Second Reprint |year=1999 |publisher=Wennawoods Publishing |location=[[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania]] |isbn=1-889037-11-7 |pages=290 |quote=ISBN refers to a 1999 reprint edition, URL is for the Susquehanna River Basin Commission's web page of Native American Place names, quoting and citing the book |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060921133421/http://www.srbc.net/docs/IndianNamesDataChart.PDF |archivedate=2006-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montour County, Pennsylvania]], and [[Montour Falls, New York]], are just two of the places named for her descendants and relatives.

Montour's role as interpreter and cultural go-between was continued by her son, [[Andrew Montour]], who shared his mother's gift for languages. He worked as an interpreter for Pennsylvania, Virginia, and [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|Sir William Johnson's]] [[British Indian Department|Indian Department]]. Andrew Montour was appointed as a captain in [[George Washington]]'s regiment at [[Fort Necessity]] during the [[French and Indian War]]. He was granted {{convert|880|acre|km2}} of land by Pennsylvania in the Montoursville area. He left Montoursville at some point and moved to what now is [[Juniata County, Pennsylvania|Juniata County]] before finally settling on [[Montour's Island]] in the [[Ohio River]] near [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite book  |last = Meginness|first = John Franklin|title = History of Lycoming County, Pennsylvania ...|year = 1892|accessdate = 2007-03-07|edition = 1st|publisher = Brown, Runk &amp; Co.|location = Chicago, IL|isbn = 0788404288|quote = (Note: ISBN refers to Heritage Books July 1996 reprint.

Madame Montour may have had another son, Lewis (or Louis) Montour, whose Indian name was apparently Tau-weson&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 109n80.&lt;/ref&gt; or Tan Weson.&lt;ref&gt;Sivertsen, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been her nephew rather than her son.&lt;ref name="Parmenter, 147"/&gt; Little is known about him. He served as a messenger, and was reportedly killed in the French and Indian War.

Madame Montour's daughter or niece, Margaret, sometimes known as "French Margaret", became the leader of French Margaret's Town, an Indian settlement at the mouth of [[Lycoming Creek]] a few miles up the West Branch Susquehanna River from Madame Montour's village. Margaret Montour's daughter [[Catharine Montour]] also became a noted local leader, and many 19th-century historians confused her with Madame Montour.

AT least four streams in Pennsylvania were named after her; see [[Montour Run]].

'''Manuel Flores''' (Jose Manuel Nepomunceno Paublino Flores; ca. 1801–1868) served as a volunteer in the Texas army in 1835–1838. Fighting and commanding, he rose through the ranks to reach sergeant status during the fight for Texas independence and was commissioned a captain during the Republic years.

==Family history – early years==
Manuel Flores was born in Spanish Texas on June 16, 1799,&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;Birth date most commonly used and referenced in the ''Handbook of Texas'', is 1801&lt;/ref&gt; in La Villa de San Fernando de Bexar. He was a skilled vaquero and ranchero that lived on the San Antonio River below San Antonio. He married Maria Josefa Courbière in 1835.  He married Margarita Garza in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bexargenealogy.com/archives/familyfiles/floresabrego.rtf Descendants of Pedro Flores de Abrego  by S. Gibson June 24, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the son of Jose Flores De Abrego and Maria Rodriquez &lt;ref name="de la Teja18"&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forttours.com/pages/hmwilson.asp#family|title=Fort Tours - Wilson County Historical Markers|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were a prominent family of Bexar, rich in the ranching history of Texas and steeped in the cause of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ffl26 Handbook of Texas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texas Revolution==
{{main|Texas Revolution}}

===Battle of Gonzales===

Anticipating the [[Battle of Gonzales]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qeg03 Handbook of Texas]&lt;/ref&gt; a meeting would be held late in September 1835 at the [[Salvador Flores|Flores]] Ranch, that would organize a volunteer force of Texas ranchers that would favor the impending revolution.&lt;ref name="de la Teja77"&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; In Gonzales, immigrants, colonists, and Texian volunteers continued gathering. The [[Texian Army]] would become a mixture of all peoples, interested in the cause of democracy. Manuel Flores would be in favor, and volunteer his services to Texas. Manuel Flores would be the courier to inform [[Stephen F. Austin]] that [[Juan N. Seguin]]'s volunteer company would join in at Béxar, against General [[Martin Perfecto de Cos|Cos]].&lt;ref name="de la Teja77"/&gt;

===Siege of Bexar===
The attention of the commander of the [[Texian]] volunteer forces, [[Stephen F. Austin]], now focused towards a [[Siege of Béxar|Béxar campaign]]. Manuel and his brother, Salvador Flores, along with [[Manuel Antonio Santiago Tarin|Manuel Leal]], organized 41 volunteers from ranches southwest of San Antonio,&lt;ref name="de la Teja24"&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; where they reinforced the Texan forces on the [[Salado Creek]], in mid-October,&lt;ref name="Tovares"&gt;Tovares (2004), [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/alamo/timeline/timeline2.html pbs/wgbh/american experience/alamo/timeline/1835 American Experience | Remember the Alamo | Timeline | PBS].&lt;/ref&gt; a few days after [[Juan Seguin]]&lt;ref name=Brands274&gt;Brands (2005), p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Edmonson218&gt;Edmonson (2000), p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fse08 Handbook of Texas]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Plácido Benavides]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbe46 Handbook of Texas]&lt;/ref&gt; of Victoria had also gathered 70 men to aid Commander Stephen F. Austin.&lt;ref name="de la Teja24"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barr18&gt;Barr (1990) p.18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindley133&gt;Lindley (2003), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel Flores entered the company with Juan Seguin elected as commander. In December 1835, after a two-month siege of Bexar, that finally ended in ferocious house-to-house fighting, Manuel Flores participated in the removal of Gen. Martín Perfecto de Cos at the [[Siege of Bexar]].&lt;ref name="de la Teja66"&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of the Alamo===
Seguin stated that he brought 15 men into the Alamo along with him. Lindley believed that the Flores brothers were defending the Alamo some time near the beginning of the siege. Manuel and the volunteers entered the Alamo on February 23.&lt;ref name=Lindley134&gt;Lindley (2003), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salvador Flores|His brother]] had been one of the 100 or so that had served at the [[Siege of Bexar]] and remained in the Alamo with Colonel [[James C. Neill]]. At some point later in the siege, after Seguin's departure as a courier, the Flores brothers exited the Alamo, thus making them survivors of the Alamo siege. In 1907, Alamo survivor Enrique Esparza stated that Santa Anna called an armistice for three days and he remembers the Flores brothers leaving at that time.&lt;ref name=Matovina82&gt;Matovina (1995), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; They had entered the Alamo hastily when the Mexican army arrived and now they took the chance to check on the condition of their families, who had been left alone in their homes. After securing the safety of their families, they regrouped and recruited a few more men from the area, gaining a few more Flores brothers. They then rendezvoused with Seguin in Gonzales. There, the native Texan defenders were joined by other men from Gonzales and proceeded westward to reinforce the Alamo.&lt;ref name="de la Teja107"&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; There, on the Cibolo, they waited to team up with Fannin's army. Fannin never made it to the Cibolo, thus the Alamo fell before they could reach it.&lt;ref name=Groneman98&gt;Groneman (1990), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of San Jacinto===
A company was reorganized in Gonzales during the first week of March 1836, and Manuel Flores became Captain Seguin's first sergeant.&lt;ref name="de la Teja136"&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; This force would now split up. Salvador Flores formed the western rear guard and would maintain this position offering protection from Mexican and Indian attack,&lt;ref name=Moore60&gt;Moore (2004), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; while Sergeant Manuel Flores, with his brothers and brother-in-law gathered their company to follow Houston eastward. This company blocked the Mexican army from crossing the Brazos river, preventing them from overtaking the Texians.&lt;ref name=groneman98&gt;Groneman (1998), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Sergeant Manuel Flores&lt;ref name="manuelflores"/&gt; together with Captain Juan Seguin, Corporal Nepomuceno Flores,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanjacinto-museum.org/Herzstein_Library/Veteran_Biographies/San_Jacinto_Bios/biographies/default.asp?action=bio&amp;id=3127 Louis W. Kemp, Nepomuceno Flores bio. 1930-1952]&lt;/ref&gt; Private Jose Maria Flores&lt;ref&gt;TAMU Dewitt (Pvt. Manuel Maria Flores) [http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/sjvetsunit.htm San Jacinto Veterans-Unit] - 2nd Regiment Volunteers 9th Company&lt;/ref&gt; and their [[Tejano]] company would then join in with Houston and Rusk to overtake Santa Anna's army, in the rout at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]].&lt;ref name=hardin209&gt;Hardin (1994), pg. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuel Flores is credited for taking the lead in the final charge against Santa Anna's army at San Jacinto. Although originally a cavalry company, they would fight with [[Sidney Sherman]]'s force as infantry. José Maria Rodriquez states in his book ''Memoirs of Early Texas'', that during the final charge, the Texans fired and fell to the ground waiting for a volley from the Mexican camp, but Manuel Flores remained standing and  challenged the Texican Army to "get up" and follow his lead, for the Mexicans were running. They got up and pursued the Army, taking many prisoners.&lt;ref name=rodriquez3-15&gt;Rodriquez (1913), pg. 3–15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Republic of Texas==
After the Texas Revolution, he was commissioned as first lieutenant in Company B of the Second Regiment of Cavalry.  Next he was commissioned the captain of a cavalry company in defense of the new republic, participating in much the same way a ranger company would.&lt;ref name=Lozano43&gt;Lozano (1985), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;He is often confused with the Mexican emissary also named Manuel Flores, who was killed at the [[battle of the San Gabriels]] in 1838.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838 he established a ranch on the south side of the Guadalupe River near a natural rock [[waterfalls]] and directly across from [[Seguin, Texas]]. Being one of the larger operating ranches of the time, it was visited in 1846 by German geologist [[Ferdinand von Roemer]], who described the home and the [[Flores Falls]] in his works ''Die Kreidebildungen von Texas and ihre organischen Einschlüsse''  (1852).

In 1842, San Antonio was overrun twice, by [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]]'s forces. During March 1842, the citizens of San Antonio sought refuge at Manuel Flores Ranch in the city of [[Seguin, Texas]].&lt;ref name="de la Teja116"&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; There, a counterattack was planned and Manuel Flores was a member of the party that pursued the army of [[Ráfael Vásquez (Mexican general)|Ráfael Vásquez]].&lt;ref name="de la Teja94"&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though his brother-in-law, [[Juan Seguin]] had also joined in the pursuit that chased the invaders from Texas,&lt;ref name="de la Teja44"&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 44&amp;117.&lt;/ref&gt; Seguin was doomed to be blamed for the invasion.&lt;ref name="de la Teja118"&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The Flores ranch in Seguin would again become a base camp when General [[Adrian Woll]] attacked San Antonio in September 1842.

==Legacy==
In later years, the Flores descendants were the ones to donate the land for the establishment of the City in Texas that bears their name: [[Floresville, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM14NT|title=The Flores de Abrego Family and Floresville - Texas Historical Markers on Waymarking.com|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Texas State Historical Marker was placed at the Floresville courthouse during the 1986 Texas sesquicentennial. It now stands in honor to Manuel Flores and his family for their service to Texas.

'''Maria Farida Indrati''', S.H., M.H. (referred to as '''Farida''';{{sfn|Sabarini 2010, Maria Farida Indrati}} born 14 June 1949) is a justice of the [[Constitutional Court of Indonesia]] serving her second term. She is currently the only woman among the Court's nine members.

==Biography==
Farida was born in [[Surakarta]], [[Central Java]], Indonesia on 14 June 1949;{{sfn|Bahari|2011|p=187}} she is the eldest of eight children born to an ''[[Antara (news agency)|Antara]]'' reporter and his wife.{{sfn|Sabarini 2010, Maria Farida Indrati}} As a child, she studied under Catholic nuns.{{sfn|Sabarini 2010, Maria Farida Indrati}} Because she suffered from [[polio]], she initially wanted to be a pianist.{{sfn|Sabarini 2010, Maria Farida Indrati}} However, due to her father's disapproval, she studied law at the [[University of Indonesia]], receiving a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree in 1975.{{sfn|Sabarini 2010, Maria Farida Indrati}}{{sfn|Bahari|2011|p=187}} Studying under [[Hamid Attamimi]], the "founder of the Indonesian Constitution Science", she decided to stay in law.{{sfn|Sabarini 2010, Maria Farida Indrati}}

Farida received her notary public's degree in 1982.{{sfn|Bahari|2011|p=187}} She later received a [[Master of Laws]] degree from the same institution in 1997, finishing her [[Doctor of law|doctorate]] studies in 2002.{{sfn|Bahari|2011|p=187}} She has also taken non-formal courses on law making in [[Leiden]], [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]], [[Boston]], and [[San Francisco]].{{sfn|Bahari|2011|p=187}}

Farida initially worked to draft legislation.{{sfn|Sabarini 2010, Maria Farida Indrati}}

She first served as a justice of the Constitutional Court after she was requested to do so by President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] in 2008;{{sfn|Bahari|2011|p=187}} she had previously been asked by eight different women's rights organisations, but had refused.{{sfn|Haryanto 2010, Judging by Her Record}} She is the nine-member court's first, as of 2010 only, female justice.{{sfn|Sabarini 2010, Maria Farida Indrati}}{{sfn|Haryanto 2010, Judging by Her Record}} During the constitutional court's appraisal of the [[Bill against Pornography and Pornoaction]], she headed the three member specialty panel.{{sfn|Sabarini 2010, Maria Farida Indrati}} Of the three, she was the only one to question its necessity, saying that the law was "open to too many interpretations, the definition of pornography [too] ambiguous, ... divisive and bound to be difficult to implement,"{{sfn|Sabarini 2010, Maria Farida Indrati}} and noting that traditional dances like [[Jaipongan]] could fall under its definition.{{sfn|National Commission 2010, Maria Farida Indrati}} She has also dissented in cases regarding blasphemy law and a quota for legislative seats for women.{{sfn|Haryanto 2010, Judging by Her Record}} She was initially expected to serve until 2013.{{sfn|Bahari|2011|p=187}}

Yudhoyono attempted to appoint Farida to a second term in 2013, though her reappointment alongside the appointment of colleague [[Patrialis Akbar]] was initially blocked by the Jakarta State Administrative Court.&lt;ref&gt;Ina Parlina , [http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/12/24/administrative-court-strips-patrialis-mk-seat.html-0 Administrative court strips Patrialis of MK seat].

Accessed 24 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; succeeding after the Jakarta High Administrative Court found that the petition against the two of them lacked legal standing for the challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Butt, [https://books.google.com.sa/books?id=gWhECQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=patrialis+akbar+appeal+court&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9AVdDArodz&amp;sig=b4-8JZUhHxO1HzcTSKS2NFCXgTQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=patrialis%20akbar%20appeal%20court&amp;f=false The Constitutional Court and Democracy in Indonesia], pg. 41. [[Leiden]]: [[Brill Publishers]], 2015. {{ISBN|9789004250598}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farida also served on one of three panels set up by the Constitutional Court to investigate former presidential candidate [[Prabowo Subianto Djojohadikusumo]]'s complaint in the [[Indonesian presidential election, 2014]], serving on the panel alongside fellow justices [[Ahmad Fadlil Sumadi]] and [[Aswanto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/94002/indonesias-constitutional-court-establishes-panels-to-handle-election-disputes Indonesia's constitutional court establishes panels to handle election disputes]. [[Antara (news agency)|Antara]], 12 May 2014. Accessed 20 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The panels ultimately found that the claims of Subianto's campaign were mostly without merit.&lt;ref&gt;Ina Parlina and Hans Nicholas Jong, [http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/08/09/prabowo-loses-first-legal-battle.html Prabowo loses first legal battle]. Jakarta Post, 9 August 2014. Accessed 20 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Farida is also a lecturer on legislation at the University of Indonesia; after becoming a constitutional justice, she kept the job because she feared that "if [she did not] teach it would be tempting for [her to] not read or not learn anything new".{{sfn|Haryanto 2010, Judging by Her Record}} She is also a guest lecturer at numerous other universities.{{sfn|Bahari|2011|p=187}}

==Views==
Farida believes that the [[Constitution of Indonesia]] guarantees equality between Indonesian men and [[Women in Indonesia|women]], but that its application has been lacking.{{sfn|Haryanto 2010, Judging by Her Record}} She believes that the traditionally patriarchal culture has limited women's chances by limiting their educational opportunities.{{sfn|Haryanto 2010, Judging by Her Record}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4472">'''Michael Arbuthnot Ashcroft''' (1920–1949) was a code breaker at [[Bletchley Park]] during [[World War II]], working in [[Hut 8]] under [[Alan Turing]].

==Early life==
Michael Ashcroft was born in 1920 to parents of German descent. He was the fourth child of Frederick Noel Ashcroft, a keen geologist and Treasurer for 18 years (1924-1945) and later President of the Royal Geological Society and of Muriel  Ashcroft (née im Thurn) the niece of the explorer and Colonial Governor Sir [[Everard im Thurn]].

He was educated at Bancroft School and then Eton College where he was King’s Scholar making his mark as a mathematics specialist winning various school prizes.

In 1940 he went up to [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], where, as a [[Natural Sciences]] scholar, he became Secretary of the Union in Hilary Term 1941. In June 1941, after only two full terms at Oxford, he was recruited by [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander]] to join Hut 8 at Bletchley Park.

==Bletchley Park==

Ashcroft joined [[Hut 8]] in [[Bletchley Park]] in June 1941, two days ahead of [[Rolf Noskwith]],  and worked there until mid 1944, when he joined Newmanry (working on Tunny).  He later worked in the Secretariat as Assistant to Nigel de Grey.&lt;ref&gt;http://rollofhonour.bletchleypark.org.uk/search/record-detail/244/&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Hut 8 he made his mark and a major contribution to breaking the Atlantic and Mediterranean [[Naval Enigma]] ‘Shark’ (or [[Enigma machine|Triton]]), as the expert on short signals.&lt;ref&gt;Mahon, A P, The History of Hut 8 1939 – 45 p 1&lt;/ref&gt; This expertise was particularly significant during the period  December 1942 – June 1943 when, during the blackout that followed the introduction by the Germans of the fourth Enigma wheel, short signals became the route back into Shark (see [[Battle of the Atlantic#Enigma in 1942|Enigma in 1942]]).&lt;ref&gt;Noskwith, R in Smith, M, The Bletchley Park Codebreakers, Hut 8 from the Inside&lt;/ref&gt; This work was considerably aided by the capturing of the short signal code books from [[German submarine U-559]] by men from HMS Petard.

After June 1943 Shark was broken on the 4 wheel bombes built by the US equivalent of Bletchley Park– OP – 20 – G.&lt;ref&gt;Noskwith, R in Erskine, R, Smith, M, The Bletchley Park Codebreakers, Hut 8 from the Inside, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashcroft left Bletchley Park in 1946. Following the end of the war he contributed a chapter on short signals to the Official History of Hut 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Mahon | first = A.P. | title = The History of Hut Eight 1939 - 1945 | publisher = UK National Archives Reference HW 25/2 | year = 1945 | url = http://www.ellsbury.com/hut8/hut8-000.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post war study and career==

In 1946 Ashcroft returned to Magdalen and obtained a first class honors degree in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]]. He stayed only two terms and left to join the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]].  He was assigned to [[HM Treasury]] on an accelerated career programme as one of their first post war administrative recruits.  “He undoubtedly found in the Treasury both work and an environment very much to his liking and, had he lived, he would have travelled far. As an administrator he was, for his age, in the first flight, zealous and effective in all things he did, a first class draftsman and a tireless worker”&lt;ref&gt;“Times Obituary” December 21st 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Ashcroft died from [[cancer]] in December 1949, so his civil service career was cut short. He was only 29.

Ashcroft’s funeral service took place at [[St Margaret's, Westminster]] on 17 December 1949, attended by [[Stafford Cripps]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], and many [[member of parliament|MP]]s, colleagues, family, and friends.

==Personality==
Described as "one of the most vigorous and questing minds of his generation".&lt;ref&gt;Statement in the House of Commons 19.12.49&lt;/ref&gt; Ashcroft was a great intellect and conversationalist. A very good friend of [[Roy Jenkins]], he was best man at his wedding in 1945. Definitely a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] supporter, he was indifferent to social distinctions and differences of class &lt;ref&gt;Statement in the House of Commons 19.12.49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Statue of Raja Bhoja 01.jpg|thumb|right|A statue of Bhoja in [[Bhopal]]]]
The 11th century [[Paramara dynasty|Paramara]] king [[Bhoja]] ruled from his capital at [[Dhara (city)|Dhara]] (Dhar in present-day [[Madhya Pradesh]], India). The period of his reign is dated approximately 1010 CE to 1055 CE, although some historians believe that he ascended the throne before 1010 CE. Bhoja inherited a kingdom centered around the [[Malwa]] region, and made several attempts to expand it varying results. He managed to annex territories as far as northern parts of [[Konkan]], but these territorial gains were short-lived. He fought wars against several of his neighbours, including the [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukyas of Gujarat]], the [[Chalukyas of Lata]], the [[Chalukyas of Kalyani]] (Western Chalukyas), the [[Chandelas of Jejakabhukti]], the [[Kachchhapaghata dynasty|Kachchhapaghatas]] of [[Gwalior]], the [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari]], the [[Chahamanas of Naddula]], and the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri]].

Apart from epigraphic records, much of the information about Bhoja's military campaigns comes from legendary accounts, including [[Hemachandra]] (12th century), Merutunga's ''Prabandha-Chintamani'' (14th century), Rajavallabha's ''Bhoja-Charitra'' (15th century), and Ballala's ''Bhoja-Prabandha'' (17th century).

== Chaulukyas: Vallabha and Durlabha ==

The kingdom of the [[Chaulukya|Chaulukyas of Gujarat]] (also known as Chaulukyas) was located to the west of [[Malwa]], the Paramara territory. Several legendary accounts talk of a rivalry between the two kingdoms during the reigns of the Chaulukya rulers Vallabha and Durlabha. Some historians, who date the start of Bhoja's reign before 1010 CE, believe that this conflict happened during the early years of his reign.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=130-131}}{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=39}}

According to the 12th century writer [[Hemachandra]], who was patronized by the Chaulukyas, Bhoja's predecessor [[Sindhuraja]] invaded the Chaulukya kingdom, but was forced to retreat by [[Chamundaraja (Chaulukya dynasty)|Chamunda-raja]]. Abhayatilaka's commentary on Hemachandra's work states that Chamunda later retired and set on a pilgrimate to [[Varanasi|Kashi]]. On the way, he passed through Malwa, whose king forced him to give up his royal insignia. According to Hemachandra, Chamunda returned to the Chaulukya capital [[Anahilavada]], and asked his son and successor [[Vallabharaja|Vallabha-raja]] to avenge his humiliation. Vallabha set out against Bhoja with an army, but died of [[smallpox]] on the way. His army then retreated to his Anahilavada.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=130-131}}{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=38}}

The 14th century writer Merutunga claims that it was Vallabha's successor [[Durlabharaja (Chaulukya dynasty)|Durlabha-raja]] who passed through Malwa on his way to Kashi, and [[Vakpati Munja|Munja]] was the Paramara king at the time. However, this account is historically inaccurate, because Munja died nearly a decade before Durlabha's ascension.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=135}} ''Sukrita Sankirtana'' by Arisimha and ''Sukrita-Kirti-Kallolini'' by Udayaprabha Suri, both written under Chaulukya patronage, claim that Vallabha defeated the king of Malwa. These claims are not supported by any historical evidence either. Only the fact that Vallabha marched against Malwa appears to be historically true, as suggested by the ''[[Vadnagar]] Prashasti'' inscription of the later Chaulukya king [[Kumarapala (Chaulukya dynasty)|Kumarapala]]. This inscription claims that the king of Malwa felt a quake on hearing about Vallabharaja's march against him.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=132}}

Durlabha became the Chaulukya king around 1009 CE, so Vallabha's invasion of Malwa must have happened before this time. Some schalars, such as D. C. Ganguly and K. N. Seth identify Vallabha's rival as Bhoja, who according to them, had just assumed the throne of Malwa around 1008 CE.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=130-131}}{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=39}} Other scholars, such as Mahesh Singh, believe that Bhoja's ascension took place after 1009 CE, and therefore Vallabha's rival must have been Bhoja's predecessor Sindhuraja.{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=40}}

According to a legend mentioned by Hemachandra, Vallabha's successor Durlabha also fought against the ruler of Malwa. According to this account, Mahendra-raja, the [[Chahamanas of Naddula|Chahamana]] ruler of [[Nadol]], organized a ''[[swayamvara]]'' (husband-choosing ceremony) for his sister Durlabha-devi. Besides Durlabha-raja, he invited the rulers of [[Anga]], [[Andhra in Indian epic literature|Andhra]], Kashi, [[Kuru Kingdom|Kuru]], [[Mathura]] and [[Ujjayini]] to this ceremony. Durlabha-devi chose Durlabha-raja as her husband. Out of jealousy, the other invitees formed a confederacy and attacked his contingent, while he was returning to his capital. Durlabha-raja defeated their combined army.{{sfn|Asoke Kumar Majumdar|1956|p=40}} The contemporary ruler of Ujjayini (which is located in Malwa) would have been Bhoja. The king was young at the time, so his participation in a ''swayamvara'' does not sound far-fetched. However, Durlabha's defeat of such a strong confederacy seems unlikely, and there is no historical evidence of a war between Bhoja and Durlabha.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=133-134}}{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=41}} Moreover, the chief of Naddula was a relatively insignificant ruler, and it is unlikely that so many major rulers left their kingdoms to attend his ceremony at a time when northern India was under attacks from [[Mahmud of Ghazni]]. Therefore, this legend does not seem to be historically accurate.{{sfn|Asoke Kumar Majumdar|1956|pp=40-41}}

== Chalukyas of Lata ==

Bhoja's first military aggression appears to be his invasion of the [[Lata (region)|Lata region]] (in present-day [[Gujarat]]), around 1018 CE. Durlabha, the [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukya]] (Chalukya) king of Gujarat, had plundered Lata in 1018 CE. Soon after this, Bhoja also invaded Lata.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=136}} Bhoja's victory over the ruler of Lata is attested by epigraphic records, as well as literary and epigraphic records, including the ''Prabandha-Chintamani'', the ''[[Udaipur (Madhya Pradesh)|Udaipur]] Prashasti'' inscription and the [[Kalyan]] [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper plate inscription]].{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=43}}

The ruler defeated by Bhoja appears to be Kirtiraja, who belonged to a [[Chalukyas of Lata|Chalukya branch]], and whose [[Surat]] grant is dated 1018 CE.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=136}} The copper-plate grant of his grandson Trilochana-pala states that his fame was taken away briefly by his enemies.{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=42}} According to [[Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi|K M Munshi]], Kirtiraja was the vassal of the [[Western Chalukya]]s, but K N Seth believes that he was an independent ruler at the time of Bhoja's invasion.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=137}}

Bhoja did not depose the Chalukyas of Lata: the epigraphic evidence suggests that the dynasty continued even after this defeat. Kirtiraja may have become independent after serving as a feudatory of Bhoja for a brief period.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=137}}{{sfn|Sailendra Nath Sen|1999|p=320}}

== Shilaharas of Konkana ==

Bhoja's invasion of Lata brought him close to the [[Shilahara]] kingdom of northern [[Konkana Kingdom|Konkana]], which was located to the south of Lata.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=136}} By this time, the Shilaharas had been weakened by a [[Western Chalukya]] invasion, and probably acknowledged their suzerainty.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=138}}

In 1017 CE, the Shilahara king [[Arikesarin|Arikesari]] was independent of Bhoja, as suggested by his 1017 CE inscription discovered at [[Thane]]. The [[Inscriptions of Bhoja#1020 CE Betma inscription|Betma copper-plate inscription]] of Bhoja, dated 3 January 1020 CE, indicates that northern Konkana was under the Paramara control by this date. Therefore, Bhoja must have invaded Konkan sometime during 1017-1020 CE.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=139}} Bhoja's conquest of Konkana was a first for a Paramara king in this region. He celebrated this victory in a big way by making generous donations to [[Brahmin]]s. His 1020 CE inscription states that he organized a ''Konkana-Grahana Vijaya Parva'' ("Konkan Victory Festival").{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=140-141}}

The Shilaharas probably continued to administer Konkana as Bhoja's vassals.{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=46}} By the end of his reign, Bhoja had lost the control of this territory. According to D. B. Diskalkar, the Western Chalukya king [[Jayasimha II (Western Chalukya dynasty)|Jayasimha II]] conquered this region from Bhoja. The 1024 CE [[Miraj]] inscription of Jayasimha states that after subduing the lords of "the seven Konkanas", he encamped near Kolhapur in order to conquer the northern regions. Diskalkar believed that the term "northern regions" here refers to northern Konkana, which Jayasimha must have captured some time before 1024 CE. The critics of this theory point out that the Miraj inscription only refers to a plan, not the actual conquest of the northern regions. Moreover, none of the Chalukya inscriptions refer to their victory over the Paramaras in Konkana, although they mention their other successes against Bhoja. According to [[Pandurang Vaman Kane|P. V. Kane]], the lords defeated by Jayasimha were the [[Kadambas of Goa]].{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=141-142}} K. N. Seth believes that it was Jayasimha's successor [[Someshvara I]], who evicted the Paramaras from northern Konkana, around 1047 CE.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=144}}

== Chalukyas of Kalyani: Jayasimha II ==

The [[Chalukyas of Kalyani]], also known as the Western Chalukyas, were the southern neighbours and bitter rivals of the Paramaras. Their king [[Tailapa II]] had defeated and killed Bhoja's uncle [[Vakpati Munja|Munja]]. Sometime before 1019 CE, Bhoja formed an alliance against them with [[Rajendra Chola]] and Gangeyadeva [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]]. At this time, [[Jayasimha II (Western Chalukya dynasty)|Jayasimha II]] was the Chalukya king.{{sfn|M. C. Choubey|2006|p=63}} The triple alliance engaged the Chalukyas at their northern and southern frontiers simultaneously.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=144-145}} The extent of Bhoja's success in this campaign is not certain, as both Chalukya and Paramara [[panegyric]]s claimed victory.{{sfn|Saikat K. Bose|2015|p=27}}

The Chalukya inscriptions state that they forced Bhoja's army to retreat. The 1019 CE [[Balligavi]] inscription of his feudatory states that Jayasimha was like a moon to the lotus Bhoja (that is, Jayasimha humbled Bhoja like a moon-rise causes a day-blooming lotus to close its petals). It claims that Jayasimha forced the Malwa army to flee the battlefield.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=145}}{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=48}} Jayasimha's 1028 CE Kulenur inscription claims that he routed the elephant army of (Rajendra) Chola, Gangeya and Bhoja.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=145}} On the other hand, the [[Inscriptions of Bhoja#Kalwan inscription|Kalvan copper plates]] of Bhoja's feudatory Yashovarman as well as the ''[[Udaipur (Madhya Pradesh)|Udaipur]] Prashasti'' inscription of Bhoja's descendants claim that he defeated the Karnatas (that is, the Chalukyas of Kalyani).{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=145}}

D. C. Ganguly believes that Bhoja achieved some early victories against the Chalukyas, but was ultimately defeated. Others, including D. B. Diskalkar and [[Hem Chandra Raychaudhuri|H. C. Ray]], believe that Bhoja was defeated by Jayasimha after some early successes, but ultimately emerged victorious against the Chalukyas after 1028 CE. According to [[Georg Bühler]], the struggle probably ended with some advantage for Bhoja, which might have been exaggerated into a great victory by the Paramara poets.{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=50}}

Swati Datta notes that the 1022 CE Depalpur inscription of Bhoja records the grant of a village to a [[Brahmin]] named Vacchala. The record states that Vacchala had migrated from [[Manyakheta]] (which was in Jayasimha's territory) to Malwa. Datta theorizes that by this time, Jayasimha's kingdom was under attack from the Chola-Kalachuri-Paramara confederacy. The Cholas had previously attacked the Chalukya kingdom during the reign of Jayasimha's ancestor [[Satyashraya]]. During this invasion, they are said to have killed the Brahmin men and married off Brahmin girls to the men from other castes. According to Datta, Vacchala might have feared a repeat of this episode in case of a Chalukya defeat. This might have motivated him to seek shelter with Bhoja, who was reputed as a patron of learned Brahmins. Datta believes that Jayasimha was able to repulse the invasion by 1024 CE.{{sfn|Swati Datta|1989|p=99}}

A ''Bhoja-Charitra'' legend claims that shortly after becoming the king, Bhoja saw a play which depicted the killing of his uncle Munja by Tailapa. An enraged Bhoja launched an expedition against Tailapa, captured him, humiliated him and finally executed him. The story is historically inaccurate, as Tailapa died before Bhoja ascended the throne.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=146}}

== Indraratha ==

The ''Udaipur Prashasti'' states that Bhoja defeated a ruler named Indraratha. A king with the same name is also mentioned in [[Rajendra Chola]]'s 1018 CE [[Thiruvalangadu]] and 1025 CE [[Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala|Tirumalai]] inscriptions. According to the Chola inscriptions, Indraratha belonged to the Somavamshi dynasty, and was defeated at Adinagara. The defeated king is identified with Indranatha of the [[Somavaṃśī dynasty|Somavamshi]] dynasty of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]], and Adinagara is identified with present-day [[Mukhalingam]]. Historians believe that the king defeated by Bhoja and Rajendra Chola was the same person. There is no evidence of Bhoja having led an independent campaign against Indraratha: he may have played a secondary role in the Chola campaign as part of an alliance.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=167-168}}{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|pp=56-57}}

== Ghaznavids ==

The [[Ghaznavids]], a Muslim dynasty of [[Turkic people|Turkic]] origin, invaded north-western India in the 11th century, led by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]]. The ''Udaipur Prashasti'' claims that Bhoja's mercenaries defeated the Turushkas (Turkic people).{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=155-156}} There are some legendary accounts of Bhoja's military successes against the foreign invaders identified with the Ghaznavids. However, there is no clear evidence to show that Bhoja fought against the Ghaznavids or any other Muslim army.{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=60}} Nevertheless, the legends suggest that Bhoja was not a silent spectator to the Ghaznavid campaigns in north-western India. The invaders did not reach Malwa during Bhoja's reign. So if Bhoja's soldiers did fight against them, the battle would have happened outside Malwa.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=155}}

According to the 16th century Muslim historian [[Firishta]], Mahmud of Ghazni invaded the Hindu [[Kabul Shahi]] kingdom in 1008 CE. Its ruler [[Anandapala]] requested help from other Hindu kings. In response, the kings of Ajmer, Delhi, Gwalior, Kalinjar, Kannauj and Ujjain formed a confederacy with Anandapala. Mahmud defeated this coalition army. However, none of the earlier Muslim historians mention the contribution of other Hindu kings to Anandapala's defence, and therefore modern historians consider Firishta's claim as an exaggeration.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=157}} It is, however, possible that some of these kings supplied troops to Anandapala. Since Ujjain is in Malwa, the king of Ujjain referred by Firishta could have been Bhoja. Some years later, Anandapala's son Trilochanapala was also defeated by Mahmud, and is said to have been granted asylum by Bhoja.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=158}}

Mahmud attacked the [[Somnath]] Hindu temple around 1024 CE. ''Kitab Zainu'l-Akhbar'' (c. 1048 CE) by 'Abd al-Hayy Gardizi states that after the Somnath raid, Mahmud chose to avoid a confrontation with a powerful Hindu ruler called Param Dev. Mahmud was carrying back a large amount of looted wealth, which might have been his motivation behind avoiding a battle. He did not return to [[Multan]] via the same route he had arrived. Instead, he chose a more dangerous route via [[Sindh]], to avoid facing Param Dev: he passed through a desert, where the scarcity of food and water killed a large number of his soldiers and animals. The 16th century ''Tabaqat-i-Akbari'' by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]] and Firishta's writings also mention this incident.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=162-163}}{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|pp=60-62}} Firishta identified Param Dev with [[Bhima I]], the Chaulukya king of Gujarat. However, this identification is contested by modern historians. Bhima had ascended the throne relatively recently, and was not a powerful ruler at the time of Mahmud's raid. In fact, according to Muslim historians, during Mahmud's invasion, he fled his capital [[Anahilavada]] and took shelter in Kandahat (identified with [[Kanthkot Fort|Kanthkot]]). Moreover, Mahmud defeated the Chaulukya army in January 1025 CE. The Muslim historians before Firishta, such as Gardizi and Nizamuddin Ahmad, mention the king of Naharawala (Anhailavada) as distinct from Param Dev. Unlike Bhima, Bhoja was a powerful and famous ruler at that time. Bhoja was also a Shaivite, and according to the ''Udaipur Prashasti'', had constructed a temple dedicated to Somnath (an aspect of Shiva). Thus Mahmud's desecration of the Somnath temple in Gujarat would have motivated Bhoja to lead an army against him. Based on these evidences, modern scholars identify Param Dev with Bhoja. According to this theory, Param Dev may be a corruption of Paramara-Deva or of Bhoja's title ''Parameshvara-Paramabhattakara''.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=163-165}}{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|pp=61-62}}

Firishta also states that in 1043 CE, the Raja of Delhi formed an alliance with other Hindu kings to re-capture the territories lost to Mahmud of Ghazni. The allies expelled Mahmud's governors from [[Hansi]], [[Thanesar]] and their dependencies. After a 4-month long siege they also took control of [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Nagarkot]]. Next, they unsuccessfully besieged [[Lahore]] for 7 months. The Raja of Delhi is identified with [[Tomar dynasty|Tomar]] ruler Mahipal, but it is unclear who his allies were. Based on the Udaipur Prashasti's claim of Bhoja's successes against the Turushkas, historians such as K. N. Seth and S. N. Sen suggest that Bhoja was a member of this confederacy.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=166}}{{sfn|Sailendra Nath Sen|1999|p=320}}

{{anchor|Mahamada}}&lt;!--Mahamada redirects here --&gt;
A ''[[Bhavishya Purana]]'' legend also narrates Bhoja's campaign against the Muslims, describing  him a descendant of the legendary kings [[Vikramaditya]] and [[Shalivahana]]. It states that Bhoja defeated several [[mleccha]] (foreign) kings after reaching the [[Indus river]]. During this campaign, he came into contact with a mleccha named Mahamada (a character modeled on [[Muhammad]], possibly combined with [[Mahmud of Ghazni]]). Lord [[Shiva]] told Bhoja that Mahamada had been doing the work of the [[pishacha]]s (demons). The poet [[Kalidasa]], who accompanied Bhoja, turned Mahamada into ash with his chants and prayers. Mahamada's disciples took the ashes, and returned to the Vahika country, where they established the ''Mada-hina'' city (literally, "without intoxication"; identified with [[Medina]]). One night, Mahamada magically took on a [[pishacha]] body and appeared before Bhoja. He told Bhoja that the pishachas will practice [[khitan (circumcision)|ritual circumcision]], keep beards but not [[sikha|topknots]] (unlike Hindus), and [[cow protection movement|eat cows]]. He further said that they will use a ''musala'' ([[mortar and pestle|pestle]]) for their rites, thus explaining the etymology of the term "[[Muslim]]". Bhoja came home and established [[Sanskrit]] language among the top three [[varna in Hinduism|varnas]] and [[Prakrit]] language among the [[Shudra]]s. During his 50-year reign, [[Aryavarta]] (the land between the [[Himalayas]] and the [[Vindhyas]]) became a blessed land where the varna system was established. On the other hand, caste mixture took place beyond the Vindhyas (that is, in [[South India]]).{{sfn|Alf Hiltebeitel|2009|pp=273-275}} This is an imaginary account not supported by any historical evidence.{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=60}}

== Chandelas and Kachchhapaghatas ==

The [[Chandelas of Jejakabhukti]] were the eastern neighbours of the Paramaras. Epigraphic evidence suggests that Bhoja, possibly aided by the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]] king Gangeya-deva, launched an expedition against the Chandela king [[Vidyadhara (Chandela king)|Vidyadhara]] (reigned c. 1003-1035 CE). The [[Mahoba]] inscription of the Chandelas states that Bhoja and the "Moon of the Kalachuris" (Gangeya), full of fear, worshipped Vidhyadhara, a master of warfare. This suggests that Vidyadhara defeated Bhoja's invading army. However, some scholars such as [[K. M. Munshi]] believe that the Mahoba inscription is merely a boastful exaggeration.{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=69}}

Bhoja was able to extend his influence among the Chandela feudatories, possibly after Vidyadhara's death. The [[Kachchhapaghata dynasty|Kachchhapaghatas]] of Dubkund were the northern neighbours of the Paramaras. During Arjuna's reign, they were Chandela vassals. However, Arjuna's successor Abhimanyu accepted Bhoja's suzerainty. The 1088 CE Dubkund inscription of Abhimanyu's grandson Vikramasimha states that the intelligent and illustrious king Bhoja-deva praised Abhimanyu's skills as a general.{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|pp=172-173}}

Bhoja also launched a campaign against the Kachchhapaghatas of [[Gwalior]], possibly with the ultimate goal of capturing [[Kannauj]]. Kirtiraja, the Kachchhapaghata ruler of Gwalior, successfully repulsed Bhoja's invasion. The [[Sas-Bahu Temple|Sas-Bahu]] inscription of his descendant Mahipala states that he inflicted a humiliating defeat on the king of Malwa.{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|pp=173}}

== Gurjaras ==

According to the ''Udaipur Prashasti'' inscription, Bhoja defeated the [[Gurjaradesa|Gurjara]] king. The identity of this king is debated by the historians. D. C. Ganguly identified him with a [[Branches of Rashtrakuta dynasty#Rashtrakuta branches|Rashtrakuta of Kannauj]]. However, no Rashtrakuta king is known to have been referred to as a "Gurjara". According to K. N. Seth, the Gurjara king can be identified with the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] ruler Trilochanapala of [[Kannauj]] (whose last known inscription is dated 1027 CE).{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=174-175}}

The Gurjara-Pratihara capital was located at Kanyakubja (Kannauj). After their decline, the area around Kanyakubja was controlled by the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]]s and the [[Gahadavala]]s. The 1104 CE Basahi inscription of the Gahadavalas states that their king [[Chandradeva]] emerged as the saviour of the land after the death of Bhoja and the destruction of [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Karna]]'s fame. Since the Gurjara-Pratihara king [[Mihira Bhoja]] had died more than two centuries earlier, "Bhoja" here must refer to the Paramara king.{{sfn|Roma Niyogi|1959|p=43-44}} This corroborates the theory that Bhoja's influence extended to Kanyakubja.{{sfn|Roma Niyogi|1959|p=15}}

In any case, historical evidence indicates that Bhoja could not retain control of Kannauj for a long time, if at all.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=174-175}} In his campaign against the Gurjaras, Bhoja may have been aided by Satyaraja, a Paramara of the [[Vagada]] branch. The Panhera inscription of Satyaraja states that he defeated the Gurjaras, and received a fortune from Bhoja.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=175}}

== Sahavahana ==

The [[Inscriptions of Bhoja#1046 CE Tilakwada inscription|1046 CE Tilakawada copper plate inscription]] states that Bhoja's general Suraditya stabilized his royal fortune by slaughtering one Sahavahana in a battle.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=175}}

Earlier scholars, including D. C. Ganguly and K. M. Munshi, identified Sahavahana with Sahila Verman of  [[Chamba State|Chamba]]'s Mushana dynasty. This identification is not correct, as Sahila Verman's reign ended in the mid-10th century, much before Bhoja's ascension. Another theory identifies Sahavahana with Salavahana, a descendant of Sahila Verman. However, it is unlikely that the small hill state of Chamba could gather an army formidable enough to destabilize Bhoja's kingdom, located nearly 1,500&amp;nbsp;km away from Chamba.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=175-176}}

D. B. Diskalkar believed "Sahavahana" to be a variant of "[[Chahamana]]", and identified the defeated king as a [[Chahamanas of Naddula|Nadol Chahamana]] ruler. H. V. Trivedi disagreed with this theory, arguing that there is no philological connection between the two words. He theorized that "Sahavahana" is a variant of [[Satavahana]], and may have been used as a generic term for the southern kingdoms (possibly the [[Western Chalukya]]s in this case).{{sfn|Harihar Vitthal Trivedi|1991|p=52}}

According to K. N. Seth, Sahavahana might not have been a king at all, as the inscription does not mention his title. He might have been a general of one of Bhoja's rivals, possibly the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]] king Karna.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=176}}

== Chahamanas ==

The various branches of the [[Chahamana]]s (Chauhans) occupied territories to the north of Bhoja's kingdom. According to the ''[[Prithviraja Vijaya]]'', Bhoja defeated [[Viryarama]], the [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Shakambhari Chahamana]] ruler. Encouraged by this success, he also waged a war against the [[Chahamanas of Naddula]] ([[Nadol]]). But in this second campaign, his army was forced to retreat, and his general Sadha was killed in a battle against [[Anahilla]].{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=177}}

== Chalukyas of Kalyani: Someshvara I ==

During the last years of Bhoja's reign, Jayasimha's son and successor [[Someshvara I]] invaded Malwa, and sacked his capital [[Dhara (city)|Dhara]]. S. N. Sen dates this invasion to some time after 1042 CE.{{sfn|Sailendra Nath Sen|1999|p=320}}

Multiple Chalukya inscriptions dated between 1058 and 1067 CE state that Someshvara invaded Malwa, and plundered its important cities, including Dhara, Ujjayni and [[Mandu, Madhya Pradesh|Mandapa]]. ''Vikramankadeva-Charita'' by [[Bilhana]], a court-poet of Someshvara's son [[Vikramaditya VI]], states that Bhoja deserted his capital Dhara, which was then sacked by Someshvara. ''Kuvalayananda'' of the 16th century philosopher [[Appayya Dikshita]] also appears to refer to this attack on Malwa by Kuntaleshvara ("Lord of Kuntala", presumably Someshvara I).{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=151-153}}

Someshvara's generals in this expedition included Gundamaya, Jomarasa, Madhusudana (Madhuva) and Nagadeva.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=153}} The 1058 CE Nagai inscription of Madhusudana states that the Chalukya king burned Dhara and Ujjayini. It credits Madhusudana with forcing the ruler of Dhara to flee the city. A 1059-1060 CE states that Nagadeva was like "a [[garuda]] to the serpent Bhoja". A 1060 CE inscription names Gundamaya as the general who captured the Mandapa fort. The 1067 CE Hottur inscription of Jomarasa describes him as "a flame of doom to Bhoja".{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=154}}

[[K. A. Nilakantha Sastri]] speculated that Bhoja might have become a Chalukya vassal as a result of this invasion. But this is not supported by historical evidence: Bhoja re-established his control over Malwa soon after the departure of the Chalukya army. Nevertheless, the defeat was a major setback for the Paramaras.{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=56}} It pushed back the southern boundary of the Paramara kingdom from [[Godavari River|Godavari]] to [[Narmada River|Narmada]].{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=154}}

== Kalachuris of Tripuri: Gangeya ==

The [[Kalwan|Kalvan]] inscription, the ''Udaipur Prashasti'' and Merutunga's ''Prabandha-Chintamani'' state that Bhoja defeated the ruler of [[Chedi Kingdom|Chedi]]. These sources do not name the defeated king, but at that time, the Chedi region was ruled by the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri]].{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=168-169}} The contemporary Kalachuri king was [[Gangeyadeva|Gangeya-deva]]. ''Parijata-Manjari'' (c. 1213 CE) by Bala Saraswati Madana, specifically identifies the defeated ruler as Gangeya. A verse engraved on a stone slab in [[Bhoj Shala]] also suggests that Bhoja defeated Gangeya of Tripuri.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=168-169}} The 1223 CE Dhar inscription of the Bhoja's descendant [[Arjunavarman]] also mentions Bhoja's victory over Gangeya.{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=64}}

Bhoja and Gangeya were once part of an alliance against the [[Chalukyas of Kalyani]]. It is not certain when they turned into enemies. According to one theory, Bhoja defeated Gangeya before his Chalukya campaign, in which Gangeya must have fought as a Paramara vassal. [[V. V. Mirashi]] believed that Bhoja may have subjugated Gangeya before 1019 CE. This is based on his reading of the 1019 CE Mukundpur inscription of Gangeya, in which the Kalachuri king is titled as ''Maharha-Maha-Mahattaka''. According to Mirashi, this title is not as high as that of the traditional ''Maharajadhiraja'', and therefore, it appears that Gangeya was a vassal of another king (Bhoja) by this time.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=170}}

A contradictory theory is that the two turned enemies after their Chalukya campaign.{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=65}} Based on an inscription found at [[Mahoba]], [[K. M. Munshi]] theorized that the two remained allies at least until 1025 CE. Based on the 1028 [[Kulenur]] inscription, K. N. Seth and Mahesh Singh believe that the Chalukyas and the Paramaras did not fight between 1028 CE and 1042 CE (after which Someshvara attacked Malwa). They believe that Bhoja may have used this time to launch an expedition against Gangeya.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=171}}{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=66}}

The Hindi-language [[aphorism]] "''Kahaan Raja Bhoj, kahan Gangu Teli''" ("where is King Bhoj, where is Gangu Teli") contrasts something very important with something very inconsequential. According to K. N. Seth, the term "[[Gangu Teli]]" may have derived from Bhoja's victory over Gangeya ("Gangu") and the ruler of Telangana ("Teli").{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=170}}

The ''Udaipur Prashasti'' also claims that Bhoja defeated one Togglala.{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=36}} S. K. Bose identifies this person with Gangeya's predecessor [[Kokalla II]].{{sfn|Saikat K. Bose|2015|p=281}}

== Last days ==

=== Chaulukyas: Bhima ===

According to Merutunga, the [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukya]] king Durlabha's son [[Bhima I]] had cordial relations with Bhoja during the early part of his reign. Bhoja, however, decided to expand his kingdom by capturing Bhima's territories in Gujarat.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=178}} When Bhima learned of the planned invasion, he sent his diplomat Damara to Bhoja's court. A play poking fun at other kings was being staged at Bhoja's court at the time. In one scene, the [[Chalukyas of Kalyani|Kalyani Chalukya]] king [[Tailapa II|Tailapa]] and another king were shown in Paramara prison. The other king asked Tailapa to move to another corner in the prison, but Tailapa refused to vacate his place, calling it his ancestral residence. At the end of this scene, Bhoja sought Damara opinion on the script, expecting him to praise the witty humour. Damara replied that the scene was indeed witty, but reminded Bhoja that Tailapa was still renowned for killing his uncle [[Vakpati Munja|Munja]]. Bhoja then abandoned his plans to attack Gujarat, and instead launched a campaign against [[Telangana|Tilanga]] (ruled by the Chalukyas of Kalyani).{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=148-150}}

Bhima launched an expedition against the Paramara branch at [[Mount Abu|Abu]], some time before 1031 CE. Dhandhuka, the ruler of Abu, had to seek shelter with Bhoja as a result. Bhima installed Vimala of the Pragvata family as his governor in Abu. The shrine of Adinatha in Abu was commissioned by Vimala in 1031 CE, so Bhima must have defeated Dhandhuka before this year. According to Jinaprabha Suri's ''Tirtha Kalpa'', Bhima later restored Dhandhuka as his vassal.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=180-181}}

[[Hemachandra]] states that Bhima was once engaged in a campaign at the [[Sindh]] frontier. Taking advantage of his absence, Bhoja's general Kulachandra sacked the Chaulukya capital Anahillalpataka ([[Anahilavada]]).{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|pp=179-180}} After his return from Sindh, Bhima dispatched his soldiers to raid Malwa several times. Merutunga's ''Prabandha-Chintamani'' states that once two such soldiers - Aluya and Akoluya - attacked Bhoja in the vicinity of his capital [[Dhara (city)|Dhara]], but the Paramara king escaped unhurt.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=181}}

=== Kalachuris of Tripuri: Karna ===

[[Lakshmikarna|Karna]], the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri king of Tripuri]] and the successor of Gangeya, attacked the Paramara kingdom during the last years of Bhoja's reign, or after his death. According to a legend mentioned by Merutunga, Karna challenged Bhoja to either a war or a palace-building contest. Bhoja, who was an old man by this time, chose the second option. The contest involved construction of a palace of pre-determined height in the shortest time possible. Karna managed to build his palace in [[Varanasi|Kashi]], while Bhoja's palace in [[Ujjain]] remained incomplete. The loser of the contest was supposed to accept the victor's suzerainty, but Bhoja went back on his words. Therefore, Karna, in alliance with Bhima of Gujarat, invaded Malwa. According to Merutunga, Bhoja died of a disease at the same time the allied army attacked his kingdom.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=182}}{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|pp=66-67}}

=== Alliance of Bhima and Karna ===

The historicity of Merutunga's legend is doubtful, but it might have some historical basis.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=183}} The Nagpur inscription of Bhoja's grandson Udayaditya mentions that he removed the "clouds of difficulties" which had spread over the Paramara capital Dhara after Bhoja's death.  It appears that the alliance of Bhima and Karna attacked Malwa shortly before Bhoja died or after his death.{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=67}}

The [[Vadnagar]] Prashasti inscription of the Bhima's descendant [[Kumarapala (Chaulukya dynasty)|Kumarapala]] states that Bhima captured the Paramara capital [[Dhara (city)|Dhara]].{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|pp=66-67}} Bhima's victory of Bhoja is also mentioned in several literary works written under Chaulukya patronage, such as ''Kirti-Kaumudi'' by Someshvara, ''Sukrita Sankirtana'' by Arisimha and ''Kumarapala-Charita'' by Jayasimha. ''Kirti-Kaumudi'' claims that Bhima captured Bhoja, but generously released him and spared his life. The legends in these literary works cannot be taken literally, as they are not corroborated by historical evidence.{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=184}}

Some historians, such as [[R. D. Banerji]] and [[Hem Chandra Raychaudhuri|H. C. Raychaudhuri]], proposed that Bhoja died while facing a defeat at the hands of the enemy confederacy. According to Raychaudhuri, besides Karna and Bhima, the confederacy may have included Someshvara (Chalukya of Kalyani) and Trilochanapala (Chalukya of Lata).{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=67}} However, other historians believe that the Karna-led invasion of Dhara happened after Bhoja's death.{{sfn|Mahesh Singh|1984|p=68}}{{sfn|Krishna Narain Seth|1978|p=183}}

[[File:TheLifeOfNephi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Still from ''[[The Life of Nephi]]'' (1915)]]
'''Nephi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|iː|f|aɪ}} {{respell|NEE|fy}}) is one of the central figures described in the [[Book of Mormon]]. He was the son of [[Lehi (Book of Mormon)|Lehi]], a [[prophet]], founder of the [[Nephite]] people, and author of the first two books of the Book of Mormon, [[First Book of Nephi|First]] and [[Second Book of Nephi|Second Nephi]].

== Early life ==
{{Main|First Book of Nephi}}
Nephi was the fourth of six sons of [[Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet)|Lehi]] and [[Sariah]].  He is believed to have been born in 615 BC.  Nephi and his family lived in [[Jerusalem]], circa 600 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/10/4#4 |title=1 Nephi 10:4 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the reign of [[Zedekiah|King Zedekiah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/1/4#4 |title=1 Nephi 1:4 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; until Lehi was commanded by God to take his family and flee into the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/2/2#2 |title=1 Nephi 2:2 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before their flight, Nephi's father prophesied the impending destruction and captivity of [[Jerusalem]] by the armies of Babylon.

&lt;br /&gt;
Nephi also mentions having sisters, though he does not mention their names or birth orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/2_ne/5/6#6 |title=2 Nephi 5:6 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exodus ==
Nephi and his family left Jerusalem, traveled to the Red Sea, and then journeyed three days further into the wilderness, stopping in a valley by a river near the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/2/4-6#4 |title=1 Nephi 2:4–6 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scholars have suggested that the location of their camp was near the city of present-day al-Bad, in the [[Tabuk Region|Tabuk region]] of [[Saudi Arabia]], approximately {{convert|375|km|mi}} South of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Cedar Fort, Inc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hilton|first1=Lynn M|last2=Hilton|first2=Hope A|title=Discovering Lehi : New evidence of Lehi and Nephi in Arabia.|date=1996|publisher=Cedar Fort, Inc|location=Springville, UT|isbn=1555172768}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lehi then sent his 4 sons (Laman, Lemuel, Sam and Nephi) back to Jerusalem to get the [[Plates of Brass|brass plates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/3/2-4#2 |title=1 Nephi 3:2–4 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After successfully obtaining the Brass Plates, they were commanded to return to Jerusalem a second time to bring [[Ishmael (Book of Mormon)|Ishmael's]] family for the purpose of providing spouses for Lehi's children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/7/1-2 |title=1 Nephi 7:1–2 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Plates of Brass ===

A powerful man named [[Laban (Book of Mormon)|Laban]] was in possession of the [[Plates of Brass]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/3/3#3 |title=1 Nephi 3:3 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; a record kept by the Jews which contained their laws, customs, history, and lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/5/10-16#10 |title=1 Nephi 5:10–16 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nephi and his brothers tried three times to get the brass plates from Laban. First, they sent Laman, who simply asked Laban for the plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/3/11-12#11 |title=1 Nephi 3:11–12 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laban tried to kill Laman, accusing him of being a thief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/3/13#13 |title=1 Nephi 3:13 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laman fled back to his brothers, extremely upset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/3/14#14 |title=1 Nephi 3:14 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second time, Nephi convinced his brothers to try to buy the plates using their abandoned wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/3/21-24#21 |title=1 Nephi 3:21–24 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laban wanted the riches but wouldn't give up the plates, sending his servants to kill them. They ran for their lives and their wealth fell into Laban's possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/3/25-26#25 |title=1 Nephi 3:25–26 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four brothers hid in a cave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/3/27#27 |title=1 Nephi 3:27 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laman and Lemuel started to beat their younger brothers severely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/3/28#28 |title=1 Nephi 3:28 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; An angel appeared and stopped them, telling Laman and Lemuel that, because of his righteousness, the Lord had made Nephi "a teacher and a ruler over them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/3/29#29 |title=1 Nephi 3:29 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Nephi returned to try one last time.&lt;ref name="1 Nephi 4:5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/4/5#5 |title=1 Nephi 4:5 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before he got to the house of Laban, he found a drunken man passed out in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/4/7#7 |title=1 Nephi 4:7 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man was Laban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/4/8#8 |title=1 Nephi 4:8 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nephi was then commanded by the Lord to kill Laban.&lt;ref name="1 Nephi 4:5"/&gt; At first, Nephi struggled with the idea, because he had never before "shed the blood of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/4/10#10 |title=1 Nephi 4:10 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Spirit]] convinced him that it is better for "one man to perish than for an entire nation to dwindle and perish in unbelief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/4/13#13 |title=1 Nephi 4:13 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nephi followed through with the command and then dressed himself in Laban's clothing and armor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/4/18-19#18 |title=1 Nephi 4:18–19 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Laban's house and ordered [[Zoram]], one of Laban's servants, to bring him the Plates of Brass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/4/20#20 |title=1 Nephi 4:20 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then led Zoram back to where his brothers were hiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/4/24-28#24 |title=1 Nephi 4:24–28 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laman, Lemuel and Sam, seeing Nephi disguised as Laban were afraid and turned to flee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/4/29#29 |title=1 Nephi 4:29 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nephi called out to them. When Zoram saw Nephi's brothers, he turned to run, but Nephi stopped him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/4/29-31#29 |title=1 Nephi 4:29–31 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nephi promised Zoram "that he should be a free man like unto us if he would go down in the wilderness with us," to which Zoram agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/4/32-38#32 |title=1 Nephi 4:32–38 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eight years in the wilderness and flight to the Promised Land ===
Nephi spent eight years in the wilderness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/17/4#4 |title=1 Nephi 17:4 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; facing many hardships, including the breaking of his bow which made it impossible to obtain food,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/16/18,21#18 |title=1 Nephi 16:18, 21 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nephi's elder brothers Laman and Lemuel rebelling against him and his father Lehi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/7/6#6 |title=1 Nephi 7:6 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/7/16#16 |title=1 Nephi 7:16 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/18/11#11 |title=1 Nephi 18:11 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nephi's rebellious older brothers attempted to kill him on at least two occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/7/16#16 |title=1 Nephi 7:16 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/17/48#48 |title=1 Nephi 17:48 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in the land of Bountiful, Nephi is commanded by God to build a ship and sail to the "Promised Land" or the Americas. However, Laman and Lemuel do not think he should, saying, "Our brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship; yea, and he also thinketh that he can cross these great waters." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng|title=1 Nephi 17|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then proceed to try to throw Nephi into the depths of the sea; however, Nephi commands them not to. He does this by saying, "In the name of the Almighty God, I command you that ye touch me not, for I am filled with the power of God, even unto the consuming of my flesh; and whoso shall lay his hands upon me shall wither even as a dried reed; and he shall be as naught before the power of God, for God shall smite him."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The land of Bountiful where this occurred was likely somewhere along the coasts of present-day [[Dhofar Governorate|Dhufar]], [[Oman]].&lt;ref name="Cedar Fort, Inc"/&gt;

== Life in the Promised Land, Temple, King of the Nephites, and death ==
{{See also|Second Book of Nephi}}
Not long after arriving in the Americas, Lehi died, leaving the leadership of their colony in Nephi's hands. His brothers [[Laman and Lemuel]] rebelled shortly thereafter, and the colony split into two. Nephi's followers named themselves "[[Nephites]]", while the others were dubbed "[[Lamanites]]". Nephites separate into the wilderness, where they begin building in the land of Nephi. Within twenty one years of arriving in the promised land, Nephi's people construct a temple.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob 5:16&lt;/ref&gt; Under Nephi's leadership the Nephite civilization prospered despite occasional war with the Lamanites. According to the Book of Mormon, Nephi was revered by his people.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob 1:10&lt;/ref&gt; Nephi's death is supposedly attributed to old age.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob 1:11&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his death, the charge of keeping the sacred records of the Book of Mormon was passed to his brother [[Jacob (Book of Mormon)|Jacob]].

== Teachings ==
Nephi is credited with several major contributions to Mormon doctrine and teachings. After his father received his [[First Book of Nephi|Vision of the Tree of Life]], Nephi received a similar vision and recorded it in more detail, including an interpretation of each element of the dream. The dream and Nephi's interpretation are quoted often by [[Latter-Day Saints]]. Nephi also saw and recorded details of the birth, life, and crucifixion of [[Jesus Christ]] – the first such relation to occur in the text of the Book of Mormon. An [[angel]] also showed him things similar to the vision of [[John the Revelator]] which is canonized in the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/14 |title=1 Nephi 14:18–27 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nephi quoted extensively from the [[Book of Isaiah]]. Between the books of First and Second Nephi 18 chapters of Isaiah are recorded almost verbatim as they appear in the [[King James Version]] of the Bible.

One of the most often quoted Book of Mormon scriptures was penned by Nephi in the narrative of his exile:

&lt;blockquote&gt;7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them. (1 Nephi 3:7)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/3 |title=1 Nephi 3 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nephi also recorded his thoughts on his own inadequacy as a disciple of Christ in what is regarded as some of the most beautiful prose in the Book of Mormon. Recorded in chapter four of [[Second Book of Nephi|Second Nephi]], it was dubbed the ''Psalm of Nephi''.&lt;ref&gt;"In his 1947 monograph Our Book of Mormon, [[Sidney Sperry]] christened this passage "The Psalm of Nephi," and it has carried that epithet ever since." – Nickerson, Matthew, ''Nephi's Psalm: 2 Nephi 4:16–35 in the Light of Form-Critical Analysis'',
Matthew Nickerson, Provo, Utah: Maxwell Institute, 1997. Pp. 26–42.&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the passage is given below:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted. My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep. He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh. He hath confounded mine enemies, unto the causing of them to quake before me. Behold, he hath heard my cry by day, and he hath given me knowledge by visions in the night-time. (2 Nephi 4:19–23)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Nephi's legacy ==
Nephi is regarded by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a major figure in the Book of Mormon, as a prophet, political leader, and record keeper. A variety of individuals throughout the Book of Mormon were named after him, including all of the kings in the early Nephite civilization. Additionally, his people referred to themselves as "[[Nephites]]" – a name that would follow them through the entire 1000-year history given in the Book of Mormon.

Nephi is also used as a personal name amongst contemporary Latter-day Saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://babynamesworld.parentsconnect.com/meaning_of_Nephi.html |title=Nephi &amp;#124; Name Meaning &amp; Origin &amp;#124; Boy Name Nephi &amp;#124; Baby Names World |publisher=Babynamesworld.parentsconnect.com |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology of ''Nephi'' ==
The origin of the name ''Nephi'' is uncertain, and disputed. As non-Mormon scholars view the Book of Mormon as a work of fiction, and do not recognize Nephi as a historical figure, the predominant scholarly view is that the name was selected or coined by [[Joseph Smith]]. Based on a non-Mormon or secular perspective, hypotheses for the name's origin include:

* its appearance as a geographic name in [[2 Maccabees]] of the Apocrypha ("And Neemias called this thing Naphthar, which is as much as to say, a cleansing: but many men call it Nephi.")&lt;ref name="Signature Books"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quinn|first1=D. Michael|title=Early Mormonism and the magic world view|date=1998|publisher=Signature Books|location=Salt Lake City|isbn=1-56085-089-2|edition=[Rev. and enlarged ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the shortening of two personal names Nephish and Nephishesim in the [[Authorized King James Version]],&lt;ref name="Signature Books"/&gt;
* a reference to the ''[[nephilim]]'' ( נְפִילִים ), who are the mythical half-immortal "giants" described in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]];&lt;ref name="Signature Books"/&gt; the name means "fallen ones."&lt;ref&gt;Aufarth Christoph; Loren T. Stuckenbruck ''The fall of the angels'' Brill (22 Feb 2004) {{ISBN|978-9004126688}} p.34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Herbert "Biblical Naming and Poetic Etymology" ''Journal of Biblical Literature'', Vol. 114, No. 1 (Spring, 1995), pp. 21–42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedivinecouncil.com/nephilim.pdf |title=Professor Michael S.

* a reference to the work ''Nephiomaoth'', which "was one of the magic names of God in early Christian [[Gnosticism]]"&lt;ref name="Signature Books"/&gt;
* or the term ''Nephes'', which is a [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] term for a ghost that wanders around sepulchers.&lt;ref name="Signature Books"/&gt;

Religious Mormon scholars generally believe that the Book of Mormon is historical, and therefore have proposed etymologies consistent with that view. For example, [[Mormon]] scholar [[John Gee]] theorizes that Nephi is a Hebrew form of the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name ''Nfr''. In [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] inscriptions of Egyptian names containing ''nfr'', the ''nfr'' element is rendered ''npy'', and the closely related Hebrew language would presumably transcribe the name the same way.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1378&amp;index=12 A Note on the Name Nephi]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Nibley]] has suggested that the name Nephi is related to the Egyptian Nehri. Some Mormon scholars have proposed that the name Nephi is related to the Hebrew word [[nephesh]] (נֶפֶש), which literally means the "complete life of a being" though it is usually used in the sense of "living being" (breathing creature). ''Psyche'' is the equivalent New Testament Greek word from which the English word soul is only translated. In the Greek Septuagint nephesh is mostly translated as psyche (ψυχή). Other Mormon scholars propose that the term is a variant of the Arabic and Hebrew words for prophet: ''Nabi''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

==Book of Mormon Movie==
In ''[[The Book of Mormon Movie, Vol. 1: The Journey]]'', adapted from First and Second Nephi, Nephi was portrayed by Canadian actor [[Noah Danby]]. Danby was a Lutheran and had never read the source material before playing the role. The portrayal was highly influenced by [[Arnold Friberg]] paintings of Nephi.

The film was rated PG-13 by American censors for "a scene of violence", having contained an image of Nephi with blood splattered on his face after beheading [[Laban (Book of Mormon)|Laban]]. This image was removed for home media releases, and the film received a PG rating.

The film was widely panned by Mormon&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700003321/Book-of-Mormon-Movie-Volume-1-The-Journey-The.html The Book of Mormon Movie], Deseret News&lt;/ref&gt; and non-Mormon critics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/2004-03-05/199711/ The Book of Mormon Movie, Volume 1: The Journey] in the Austin Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt;. The Austin Chronicle wrote

:''Where’s Steve Reeves when we really need him? Even in his present condition, the former Hercules could emote up a storm compared to The Book of Mormon Movie’s Noah Danby, who plays straight-shootin’ Mormon icon Nephi with all the finesse of a [[golem]].''

'''Paul Theodore Hellyer''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|PC}} (born 6 August 1923) is a Canadian engineer, politician, writer, and commentator who has had a long and varied career. He is the [[List of current members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada#St. Laurent|longest serving]] current member of the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|Privy Council of Canada]], just ahead of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Current Chronological List of Members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada|url = http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/index.asp?lang=eng&amp;page=information&amp;sub=council-conseil&amp;doc=members-membres/chronolog-eng.htm|publisher = [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|Privy Council Office]]|accessdate = 17 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hellyer was born and raised on a farm near [[Waterford, Ontario]]. Upon completion of high school, he studied [[aeronautical engineering]] at the [[Curtiss-Wright Technical Institute|Curtiss-Wright Technical Institute of Aeronautics]] in [[Glendale, California]], graduating in 1941. While studying, he also obtained a private pilot's licence.&lt;ref name=empireclub&gt;{{cite speech

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation, Hellyer was employed at [[Fleet Aircraft]] in [[Fort Erie, Ontario]], which was then making training craft for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] as part of Canada's war effort in [[World War II]]. He attempted to become an RCAF pilot himself, but was told no more pilots were necessary, after which he joined the [[Royal Canadian Artillery]] and served as a gunner for the duration of the war.&lt;ref name=empireclub/&gt;

Hellyer earned a Bachelor of Arts from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=empireclub/&gt;

==Early political career==
[[File:Paul Hellyer 1940s.jpg|thumb|left|Hellyer in the 1940s (age early 20s)]]
First elected as a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] in [[Canadian federal election, 1949|1949 federal election]] in the riding of [[Davenport (electoral district)|Davenport]], he was the youngest person ever elected to that point in the [[House of Commons of Canada]]. He served a brief stint as [[Parliamentary Secretary|Parliamentary Assistant]] to the [[List of Canadian Ministers of National Defence|Minister of National Defence]], and made a good impression. He was then named [[Associate Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Associate Minister of National Defence]] in the [[Cabinet of Canada|cabinet]] of Prime Minister [[Louis St. Laurent]]. This post was short-lived, though, as Hellyer lost his seat when the St. Laurent government lost the [[Canadian federal election, 1957|1957 election]] two months later.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Hellyer returned to parliament in a 1958 by-election in the neighbouring riding of [[Trinity (electoral district)|Trinity]], and became an effective opposition critic of [[John George Diefenbaker|John Diefenbaker's]] [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] government.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Cabinet minister and Liberal leadership candidate==
When the Liberals returned to power in the [[Canadian federal election, 1963|1963 election]], Hellyer became [[List of Canadian Ministers of National Defence|Minister of National Defence]] in the [[Canadian cabinet|cabinet]] of [[Lester B. Pearson]]. This was the most significant period in Hellyer's political career. As Minister of Defence, he oversaw the drastic and controversial integration and [[Unification of the Canadian Forces|unification]] of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], [[Canadian Army]], and the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] into a single organization, the [[Canadian Forces]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Hellyer contested the [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 1968|1968 Liberal leadership election]], placing second on the first ballot, but slipped to third on the second and third ballots, and withdrew to support [[Robert Winters]] on the fourth ballot, in which [[Pierre Trudeau]] won the leadership. He served as Trudeau's [[List of Canadian Ministers of Transport|Transport Minister]], and was Senior Minister in the Cabinet, a position similar to the current position of [[Deputy Prime Minister of Canada|Deputy Prime Minister]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Politics 1969–1988==
In 1969, Hellyer issued a major report on housing and urban renewal in which he advocated incremental reforms rather than new government programs. He called for greater flexibility in Canada's mortgage loan system, and encouraged corporate pension funds to invest more money in housing programs.&lt;ref name="Winnipeg Free Press 1969, p. 11"&gt;''Winnipeg Free Press'', 25 January 1969, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; His approach did not meet with universal acceptance. Some provincial and municipal governments were openly skeptical,&lt;ref&gt;''Winnipeg Free Press'', 30 January 1969, p. 6. It was noted that [[Toronto]] councillor [[David Rotenberg]] was a supporter of Hellyer's proposals.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heward Grafftey]], a left-leaning [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] with an interest in housing, called for a more radical approach.&lt;ref name="Winnipeg Free Press 1969, p. 11"/&gt;

Hellyer's report also called for the suspension of the "wholesale destruction of older housing" and for "greater selectivity... in the demolition of existing houses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milner|first1=J.B.|title=Review of Report of the Federal Task Force on Housing and Urban Development by Paul T. Hellyer|journal=University of Toronto Law Journal|date=1969|volume=19|issue=3|page=442|doi=10.2307/825051|jstor=825051}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grand urban renewal projects would come to an end as a result of his Task Force. Hellyer resigned from cabinet and the Liberal caucus in 1969 over a dispute with Trudeau over the implementation of the housing program.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Hellyer sat in Parliament as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] for several years. After his 1971 attempt to form a new political party, [[Action Canada]], failed, [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] leader [[Robert Stanfield]] invited him to join the PC [[caucus]]. He returned to prominence as an opposition critic and was re-elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 1972|1972 election]] as a Progressive Conservative. He lost his seat, however, in the [[Canadian federal election, 1974|1974 election]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Despite this loss, Hellyer contested the [[Progressive Conservative leadership election, 1976|PC leadership election]] of 1976. His views were too right wing for most delegates, and alienated many [[Tories]] with a speech attacking [[Red Tories]] as not being "true conservatives". He finished a distant sixth of eight contestants on the second ballot; [[Joe Clark]] won the leadership.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Hellyer rejoined the Liberal Party in 1982, but remained mostly silent in politics. In 1988, he contested the Liberal nomination in the [[Toronto]] riding of [[St. Paul's (electoral district)|St. Paul's]], losing to [[Aideen Nicholson]], who had defeated Hellyer 14 years previously when he was a Tory MP in the adjacent riding of Trinity.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Canadian Action Party==
In 1997, Hellyer formed the [[Canadian Action Party]] (CAP) to provide voters with an economic nationalist option following the collapse of the [[National Party of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadianactionparty.ca/WhoWeAre/OurHistory.asp |title=Canadian Action Party: Our History |accessdate=2005-07-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009033949/http://www.canadianactionparty.ca/WhoWeAre/OurHistory.asp |archivedate=9 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hellyer believed that both the Progressive Conservative and Liberal parties were embracing [[globalization]], and that the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] was no longer able to provide a credible alternative. CAP also embraced Hellyer's proposals for monetary reform: that the government should become more involved in the direction of the economy by gradually reducing the creation of private money and increasing the creation of public money from the current ratio of 5% public / 95% private back to 50% public and 50% private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadianactionparty.ca/PartyInfo/Policies.asp?A=2&amp;B=1&amp;C=0&amp;D=0&amp;Language=English |title=Canadian Action Party:Policies (2006) |accessdate=2005-07-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009111624/http://www.canadianactionparty.ca/PartyInfo/Policies.asp?A=2&amp;B=1&amp;C=0&amp;D=0&amp;Language=English |archivedate=9 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadianactionparty.ca/PartyInfo/Policies.asp?A=9&amp;B=3&amp;C=0&amp;D=0&amp;Language=English |title=Canadian Action Party:Policies (2005) |accessdate=2005-07-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201032012/http://www.canadianactionparty.ca/PartyInfo/Policies.asp?A=9&amp;B=3&amp;C=0&amp;D=0&amp;Language=English |archivedate=1 December 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His party remained a little-noticed [[minor party]], and Hellyer lost bids for a seat in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997]] and [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 elections]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Following the 2000 election, and a resurgence for the New Democratic Party, Hellyer approached NDP leadership to discuss the possibility of merging the two parties into 'One Big Party'. This process was furthered by the passage of a unanimous motion at the CAP's convention in 2003.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In early 2004, after several extensions of the merger deadline, the NDP rejected Hellyer's merger proposal which would have required the NDP to change its name. Hellyer resigned as CAP leader, but remains a member of the party. Rumours that he might run for the NDP in the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 election]] proved to be unfounded.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Extraterrestrial issues==
On 3 June 1967, Hellyer flew in by helicopter to officially inaugurate an [[unidentified flying object]] landing pad in [[St. Paul, Alberta]]. The town had built it as its [[Canadian Centennial]] celebration project, and as a symbol of keeping space free from human warfare. The sign beside the pad reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;The area under the World's First UFO Landing Pad was designated international by the Town of St. Paul as a symbol of our faith that mankind will maintain the outer universe free from national wars and strife. That future travel in space will be safe for all intergalactic beings, all visitors from earth or otherwise are welcome to this territory and to the Town of St. Paul.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abheritage.ca/stvincent-stpaul/st_paul/community_UFO_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In early September 2005, Hellyer made headlines by publicly announcing that he believed in the existence of [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]]. On 25 September 2005, he was an invited speaker at an [[exopolitics]] conference in Toronto, where he told the audience that he had seen a UFO one night with his late wife and some friends. He said that, although he had discounted the experience at the time, he had kept an open mind to it. He said that he started taking the issue much more seriously after watching [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s UFO special in February 2005.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In 2007, the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' reported that Hellyer is demanding that world governments disclose alien technology that could be used to solve the problem of [[climate change]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;I would like to see what (alien) technology there might be that could eliminate the burning of fossil fuels within a generation...that could be a way to save our planet...We need to persuade governments to come clean on what they know. Some of us suspect they know quite a lot, and it might be enough to save our planet if applied quickly enough.&lt;ref&gt;Ottawa Citizen (28 February 2007). Alien technology the best hope to 'save our planet': ex-defence boss. Ottawa Citizen, 28 February 2007. Retrieved on 2008-04-30 from {{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=3e57926c-bfeb-4ff3-acf6-50c575ee996c |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430213154/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=3e57926c-bfeb-4ff3-acf6-50c575ee996c |archivedate=30 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview with [[RT (TV network)|RT]] (formerly Russia Today) in 2014, characterised by Yahoo News as "sadly hard to take seriously", Hellyer said that at least four species of aliens have been visiting Earth for thousands of years, with most of them coming from other star systems, although there are some living on Venus, Mars and Saturn’s moon. According to him, they "don't think we are good stewards of our planet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/dailybrew/former-canadian-defence-minister-paul-hellyer-says-aliens-205829262.html |title=Aliens miffed at Earth's warmongering ways, former Canadian defence minister says |date=7 January 2014 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Hellyer was an early{{when|date=December 2016}} investor in the ''[[Toronto Sun]]''. He also served as a syndicated columnist for the newspaper&lt;ref&gt;The Writers Directory 1980-1982, p. 554. https://books.google.ca/books?id=Hi-xCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA554&amp;lpg=PA554&amp;dq=paul+hellyer+toronto+sun+column&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sRRqZ63c6l&amp;sig=ABvNWQzUUSRLjWsiZofm80gObco&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbj-K2y6LSAhXM3YMKHQrxA-QQ6AEITjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20hellyer%20toronto%20sun%20column&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; between 1974 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/paul-hellyer/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/culture-magazines/hellyer-paul-t&lt;/ref&gt;

Hellyer currently resides in Toronto. He has three children and five grandchildren.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Books==
Hellyer has written several books on Canada and [[globalization]], including ''[[One Big Party: To Keep Canada Independent]]'', in which he promoted the merger of the CAP, NDP, and various left-wing activists to save Canada from the effects of [[globalization]], as well as possible annexation by the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Rachid Mohamed Rachid''' or '''Rasheed Mohamed Rasheed''' became [[Egypt]]'s Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry in July 2004. Two years later, the ministry was expanded to include domestic trade within Egypt and was renamed the [[Ministry of Trade and Industry (Egypt)|Ministry of Trade and Industry]] (MTI). He has been described as the first [[businessman]] ever to hold a cabinet position in Egypt and as a reformer.&lt;ref name="GPS"&gt;Zakaria, Fareed. Interview with Rachid on the television show ''Global Public Square'', CNN, 6 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On February 1, 2011, during the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]], Rachid traveled to Dubai.&lt;ref name=wpbio /&gt; Following the downfall of the Mubarak regime, Rachid was tried ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'',&lt;ref name=ajTrial /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcTrial /&gt;

== Education ==

Rachid received his B.Sc. in [[Mechanical Engineering]] from the [[Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University|Faculty of Engineering]] at [[Alexandria University]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="MFTI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfti.gov.eg/english/minister.htm|title=Ministry of Trade and Industry|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BusinessToday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesstodayegypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1302|title=Rachid Speaks|format=Online News Magazine|work=BusinessToday|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has attended a number of management programs in the [[United States]], including the Management Development Program at [[Stanford University]] in 1983, the Strategic Management Program at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] in 1993, and the Advanced Management Program at [[Harvard Business School]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="MFTI"/&gt;

== Career ==

Prior to joining government, Rachid had an entrepreneurial and multinational career. He established and grew [[Fine Foods]] to become Egypt’s leading{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} foods brand. In 1991, a joint venture was formed with [[Unilever]] establishing [[Unilever Mashreq]]. He was later appointed as President of Unilever’s [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[Turkey]] businesses&lt;ref name="EgyptToday"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.egypttoday.com/|title=EgyptToday|website=EgyptToday|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; based out of [[London]].

As minister, Rachid was a member of the government's new 'economic team' tasked with delivering a program of reforms to open Egypt up to international trade and investment. As Minister of Trade and Industry, his mandate included liberalizing Egypt's industrial sectors, attracting foreign direct investment into industry, and creating jobs. He is responsible for Egypt's foreign trade portfolio, managing Egypt's network of preferential trade agreements (with [[United States]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and the Middle East) and growing Egyptian exports. Rachid also oversees Egypt's internal trade market and is responsible for the creation of Egypt's first Competition and Consumer Protection Authorities.

As minister, Rachid pioneered a new form of public-private partnership in Egypt by involving members of the private sector in the government policy formulation process. Rachid also worked to harmonize Egypt's industrial policies with its international commitments and thus enable Egyptian industrialists and traders to benefit from Egypt's existing trade agreements.

During his time as minister, the following trade agreements were signed:
*The Qualifying Industrial Zones Protocol (QIZs), which allows Egyptian-made products quota- and duty-free access to the US market provided they contain 10.5 percent Israeli content.
*The Egypt-Turkey Free Trade Agreement, which allows products made in Egypt and Turkey duty-free access to the respective markets.
*The Egypt-EFTA (the European Free Trade Area) Free Trade Agreement, which gives products manufactured in Egypt and the EFTA-member countries, which include Switzerland, Norway, Lichtenstein and Iceland, privileged access to other members' markets.

The Egyptian cabinet was dismissed at the end of January 2011, after widespread public protests against the government, and then Rachid no longer held a ministerial position.
Shortly afterward, Egyptian prosecutors froze his assets and prevented him from traveling, though he had already left the country by this time.&lt;ref name="GPS"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wpbio&gt;Zacharia, Janine.

'''Rio Reiser''' (born '''Ralph Christian Möbius'''; 9 January 1950 – 20 August 1996), was a [[Germany|German]] rock musician and singer of rock group [[Ton Steine Scherben]]. Reiser supported [[squatting]] in the early 1970s and later the green political party [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Die Grünen]]. After [[German reunification]], he joined the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]].

== Life ==
His father was an engineer for [[Siemens AG]], and the family moved several times because of his father's work; they lived in [[Berlin]], [[Upper Bavaria]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Mannheim]], and [[Fellbach]]. Reiser was never really able to feel at home in any of these places. Many of his friends said, when they were asked in an interview which was broadcast on the TV channel [[arte]] in 1998, that he started playing music to create a place where he felt at home.

Reiser was known by his friends as someone who had a very special mind of his own. For example, he managed to persuade his mother [[Erika Möbius]] that he was allowed to stop attending school and start an apprenticeship in a studio for photography, which he then quit in order to join a music conservatory and later to follow his two older brothers to Berlin at the early age of 17 in order to put the world's first "Rock Opera" onto stage. His mother supported his musical and artistic ambitions since she had soon realized that he was an [[autodidact]]; he never learned things when he was taught by someone else. Thus he taught himself how to play [[cello]], [[guitar]], the [[piano]] and other instruments, wrote lyrics and poetry and later also assumed jobs as actor in some movies and TV shows or at the theatre.

He was awarded his nickname Rio as teenager from an eccentric artist friend of the family who invented the name "Rio de Galaxis" for him in an "intergalactic youth ordination". He kept the nickname and later decided to completely change his name from Ralph Möbius to Rio Reiser because he played a leading role in the movie "Johnny West" and needed a catchy artist name. He took the idea for the name Reiser from his older brother Gert who had occasionally used it as artist name before. The name makes reference to the main character of the autobiographical novel ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Anton Reiser|de}}'' by [[Karl Philipp Moritz]].

As an adult, Rio soon discovered his musical talents which opened a way for him to express himself, thus enabling him to overcome restraints he otherwise felt due to a certain, intrinsic insecurity or shyness towards other people. The ability to reach out to others—even to the unknown masses in a concert audience—through his musical performance was later often referred to as being the core of his special talent to touch his listeners, or even to "build a relationship" with each of them for the period of a concert.

During his teenage years, Rio Reiser first discovered—and immediately became a big fan of—[[The Beatles]] at age 13 who represented the sound—and way of life—of the future for him and also inspired him to learn to play guitar, to compose his own songs and to form his first band. Later he preferred the rough, direct sound of [[The Rolling Stones]]. In reference to John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who were usually credited as "Lennon/McCartney" with respect of the songs they wrote, Rio and his band colleague and best friend R.P.S. Lanrue (real name Ralph Peter Steitz) as composers of most of the Ton Steine Scherben-songs were often credited as "Möbius/Steitz". Besides contemporary rock bands which became the soundtrack of the social changes beginning in the Sixties, Rio Reiser was also influenced by other music styles including orchestral film soundtracks, German "folk songs" and traditional music and German singers such as [[Marlene Dietrich]].

Reiser was unique among German rock stars of his time in being [[coming out|openly]] [[gay]], although he didn't come out publicly until the 1980s.&lt;ref name="riolyrics"&gt;{{citation |title=Rock king of Germany |date=August 23, 1996 |url=http://www.riolyrics.de/artikel/id:124 |periodical=[[The Guardian]] |first=Denis |last=Staunton |accessdate=23 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of his career, Reiser sometimes felt misfit among the political groups and various movements which, in the early Seventies, did not strongly approve of homosexuality, but later gained more confidence while working with artists who were engaged in the newly forming gay movement of Berlin, including the gay performance group "Brühwarm" which recorded two LPs with music composed by Ton Steine Scherben.

== Musical career ==

While he still went to school, Reiser became singer in his first [[rock band]] [[The Beat Kings]]. The band had been founded by [[R.P.S. Lanrue]] (real name Ralph Peter Steitz), a boy living in the neighbourhood, who had heard of Reiser's singing talents and had asked him to join the band after letting Reiser perform a few songs to give a sample (as R.P.S. Lanrue later claimed in an interview, the Rolling Stones song "Play with fire" tipped the balance). Lanrue, who was of the same age as Reiser, soon became Reiser's closest friend and musical counterpart who went on to support Reiser as musician and lived with him most of the time until his death.

After having quit school, Reiser left his then hometown, as well as The Beat Kings, to follow his two older brothers' call to Berlin in order to compose the music for their common project, the first [[Beat-Opera]], which turned out to be, in the words of Rio, an "absolute flop". Nevertheless, Reiser stayed in Berlin, where he was later joined by Lanrue.

After occasionally having toured the countryside with the theatre group "Hoffmans Comic Theater" (consisting in Reiser, his brothers and a group of friends), Reiser went on to continue theatrical projects in Berlin where he joined an improvisation theatre group which played scenes from the everyday life of pupils and trainees, thus adopting and reflecting the social problems among young people in West Berlin in the Sixties, as well as its tense and sense of imminent social change. The theatre was very successful with young people and toured through Germany until 1969. The involvement in the context of the student and youth movement—not only as musician and actor, but often in the political debates which were to follow the theatre performance as well, played an important role for Rio Reiser's development of political awareness and for his lifelong commitment—both privately and as musician—to liberation movements of various kinds, including, in particular, the left-wing political movement characteristic for the Sixties and Seventies (while he liked to put an emphasis on supporting the workers' and "simple people's" interests rather than the students' intellectual approach), the Gay liberation movement and later, the German ecological movement. His musical work to a large extent reflects these political influences and convictions and thus can hardly be detached from his political positions.

In 1970, Reiser recorded his first single with the band [[Ton Steine Scherben]]. The band name was chosen in a lengthy democratic decision procedure among the members, friends and supporters of the band. The original name idea was actually "[[Volkseigener Betrieb|VEB]] Ton Steine Scherben", but the "VEB" was soon dropped. The band name can be translated both as "clay stones shards" and as "sound stones shards", thus offering different approaches to interpretation (sometimes also understood as a political program) and, last not least, making reference to Reiser's favorites The Rolling Stones. In that same year the group performed their first public concert and recorded their first full-length record.

The band soon became very popular with the squatter scene, left-wing student and workers' movement and was invited to numerous political events to provide the soundtrack to demonstrations, parties and rallies across Germany which often inspired the audience to translate the message into action afterwards. Thus, many buildings were seized after the end of a concert, and the band often ended up sitting in some commune discussing the political agenda with their hosts. Reiser later revealed in his autobiography that he sometimes would have preferred to just get away with some nice person.

[[File:Fresenhagen rio reiser-wohnhaus.jpg|thumb|This farmhouse in Fresenhagen became Reiser's residence in 1975.]]
15 years of touring, four more LPs and various film projects and collaborations with other musicians followed, including the recording of two children's records. Reiser lived together with the band and a large group of friends and supporters most of that time, first sharing a commune in Berlin. In 1975—after the band was tiring of the numerous demands and expectations by all kinds of political groups—the group settled down on a farm in Fresenhagen in North Germany which continued to be Reiser's refuge and place of inspiration even after moving back to Berlin a couple of years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rio Reisers Residenz – Nichts als Scherben |trans-title=Rio Reiser's Residence – Broken to Pieces |work=[[die Tageszeitung]] |url=http://www.taz.de/!47677/ |date=1 February 2012 |first=Klaus |last=Irler |language=German |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the band's most important and ambitious albums, the "Black Album", was recorded there.

''Ton Steine Scherben'' were musically very successful and, being one of the first rock bands in Germany which actually wrote and performed German rock songs, opened the door for countless successful German rock and pop bands to follow. Due to their refusal to adapt to the demands of the mainstream music business, as well as to financial mismanagement, a certain "outlawish" image in the eyes of the large radio and TV stations and a fan community which often forgot that the band had to make a living out of the music and would have despised any commercial ambitions, they were not able to translate their musical success and widespread popularity into financial stability.

In 1985, Reiser and the band finally split, partly due to a feeling that it was time to move on, but to a large extent because of a desastrous financial situation. Reiser had a large debt with the group, but his early solo career went so well that he was free from debt in a short time. His first solo record-album was called "Rio I" and included the popular song [[König von Deutschland]] ("King of Germany"). The album was produced by [[Annette Humpe]], a renowned German music producer who had already produced Reiser's very first solo single, "Dr. Sommer", some time ago when he was in need of cash and had asked her for support. The song "König von Deutschland" became one of the few real hits of Reiser, has been covered and cited by many artists ever since and is still known among most people in Germany. Other hit singles of the first album included the love song "Für immer und dich" and the melancholic "Junimond". Reiser could not repeat the commercial success of the first album, nevertheless he released five further studio albums until his death, most of them highly praised by the critics.

Many of his fans from the ''Ton Steine Scherben''-days thought that he was selling out to mainstream, capitalist music business, and blamed him for becoming—at least for a period of time—a commercially successful musician. However, when listening closely to the lyrics, it can be noted that Reiser never abandoned his personal approach to music, politics, life and love, although the message was delivered in a more subtle way now. Reiser sometimes admitted that the objections to his solo music, even hatred by some old-time fans was a serious problem for him. Wandering on the edge of commercial adaptability, while trying to conform with the expectations of old friends, fans and political movements which he supported meant a difficult struggle for Reiser which sometimes drove him to despair and depression. At the same time, he continued to be a very creative, productive musician and song-writer who collaborated with other musicians and friends and underwent strenuous concert tours which often brought him close to physical exhaustion. One of the highlights of his career were two concerts performed in East Berlin in 1988 where he faced a sold out concert hall filled with young people on the verge of the revolution which one year later led to the collapse of the political system of the German Democratic Republic and the opening of the Berlin wall. Recordings of the concerts prove that the east German audience knew the lyrics of his solo songs, and in particular all of the "Ton Steine Scherben" songs which he performed by heart, even though the albums were hard to come by in the GDR.

Reiser wrote and performed most of his songs entirely by himself, although he was often accompanied by his longtime friend R.P.S. Lanrue who continued to support him as lead guitar player and also delivered many musical ideas, while a few of his song lyrics were also written by or together with his long-term partner Misha Schoeneberg. Reiser's sixth and last solo album, which was recorded in 1995, was called ''[[Himmel und Hölle]]'' (''Heaven and Hell''). The album was the last one which he was contractually obliged to deliver to his major music company, and both the musical approach as well as the lyrics imply that Reiser was about to return to a state of inner independence from the major business not only personally, but also in artistic terms, including a sound and concept which is often seen as more authentic than the previous studio albums. After the release of the last album, which was not strongly marketed by his company, even though praised by the critics, Reiser was preparing new songs which he would have produced independently again, the completion of which was interrupted by his sudden and unexpected death.

Some critics say that Rio Reiser created a new image of a German folk singer; he was even called a "[[Schlager]]" artist, and a "[[Volksmusik]]" musician (sometimes translated as "folk music", but in a literary sense it means music of the people).  To other critics, Rio Reiser was simply a singer in a rock band.  However, Reiser sometimes approved of being referred to a Volksmusik musician, because he thought that this would simply mean he sang music for the people.

== Death ==
[[File:Grave of Rio Reiser at Alter St.-Matthäus-Kirchhof Berlin 2012.jpg|thumb|Grave of Reiser in Berlin]]
Rio Reiser died on 20 August 1996 from a circulatory collapse after [[internal bleeding]] at his home in Fresenhagen, where he was buried on his own property under an apple tree.

His grave was moved to Berlin in March 2011, because Reiser's heirs sold the Fresenhagen property.

'''Rufe Persful''' (May 25, 1906 – May 16, 1991) was an [[United States|American]] criminal, convicted for murder, kidnapping and robbery. He was considered one of the most dangerous criminals of his era by the authorities. Convicted with the murder and robbery of an elderly man at the age of 18, he was sentenced to 15 years in [[Arkansas]] State Penitentiary, but unlike a standard prison, it involved farm labour. He was given the task of shooting fellow inmates with a shotgun if they attempted to escape. He killed and disabled many prisoners during his time at the Arkansas Penitentiary, punctuated by periods of [[parole]] as a reward for his prison protection, and then re-offending and being sent back to resume his role.

In December 1934, Persful was convicted for kidnapping and robbery in [[Paragould, Arkansas]] and sentenced to 20 years, after which he was transferred to [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta]]. Two inmates recognized him from Arkansas and word spread of his killing of fellow inmates and he began being severely abused. He was transferred to [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]] a year later but was recognized and continued to be tortured by his inmates because of his past offenses. In 1937, it was Persful who attempted to cut off his hands in sheer desperation of his experiences at Alcatraz&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/rock/rock-032.htm |title=The Rock: A history of Alcatraz Island, 1847–1972 |work=Historic Resource Study |first1=Erwin N. |last1=Thompson |accessdate=September 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]]. He was eventually sent to [[McNeil Island]] Penitentiary where he was again recognized and suffered much abuse from his fellow inmates, despite being heavily watched over by the prison staff. He was released in April 1948 and moved in with a relative in [[Gary, Indiana]], never to be convicted of a crime again.

==Biography==
At the age of 18, he was convicted with the murder and robbery of an elderly man, and was sentenced to 15 years in [[Arkansas State Penitentiary]], farm labor rather than prison; at [[Tucker Prison Farm]], he was given the duty of "high power", shooting fellow inmates in the belly button if they attempted to flee from the fields.&lt;ref name="WardKassebaum2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ward|first1=David A.|last2=Kassebaum|first2=Gene G.|title=Alcatraz: The Gangster Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kV6KXrkQjTsC&amp;pg=PA140|accessdate=7 September 2012|date=19 May 2009|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25607-1|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; After shooting a prisoner who tried to escape, his sentence was reduced to 9 years but he was almost immediately released on parole. About 18 months later, he was indicted for shooting a woman in the back with a [[shotgun]] but was never tried for attempted murder.&lt;ref name="WardKassebaum2009"/&gt; Back at the prison farm, he resumed his position and shot another prisoner attempting to escape and was paroled again as a reward. After several months, he committed an [[armed robbery]] and was sentenced to 5 years in the [[Prison|penitentiary]], but again resumed his "high power" position, during which he killed one and permanently crippled three others who attempted to flee.&lt;ref name="WardKassebaum2009"/&gt; A circuit judge refused him parole but after he killed four prisoners attempting to escape in October 1933, he was released on parole for a fourth time 8 months later.&lt;ref name="WardKassebaum2009"/&gt; 
[[File:Rufe Persful notebook.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Alcatraz profile of Persful]]
In December 1934, Persful was convicted for the kidnapping of a [[Watchman (law enforcement)|nightwatchman]] in Paragould, Arkansas and robbing the Schug Brothers of some $1000 with his companion [[Riley Gunn]] before being caught in [[Osceola, Missouri]]. He was sent to United States Penitentiary, [[Atlanta]] to serve twenty years. Despite Atlanta's reputation as a prison where inmates stuck together, two convicts knew Persful from the Arkansas penitentiary and word spread of his killing and maiming of fellow prisoners and of his shooting a woman in the back, and he began being severely beaten and bullied by his fellow inmates. The Atlanta prison officials eventually learned of the frequent abuse and violence facing Persful, and in December 1935 sent him to Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. However, he continued to be unpopular with the inmates, many of whom had transferred to Alcatraz from Atlanta and knew of his history.&lt;ref name="WardKassebaum2009"/&gt;

Once he was shifted to the Alcatraz prison, his heinous crime in [[Tucker, Arkansas]] of murdering a female prisoner who was pregnant, to camouflage rape, was also exposed. Once his misdeed was exposed by the prison doctor, the issue became a widely publicized national scandal involving murders of inmates by other inmates and this brought [[Homer Stille Cummings]], the [[US Attorney General]] and [[J. Edgar Hoover]], [[FBI Director]] to Alcatraz twice to verify the issue and cross check with [[Carl Janaway]] who was also his inmate at Tucker and had been attacked by Rufe Persful.&lt;ref name=" Courtney 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last= Courtney |first= Gary D.|title= Carl Janaway – Smartest Bandit of the Cookson Hills: Last Surviving Bank Robber of the 1930's, Builder of Getaway Cars for "Pretty Boy" Floyd &amp; Nursemaid to Al Capone in Alcatraz Prison |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gTgxpsqbKgAC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=Rufe+Persful&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ccaoYSNs5m&amp;sig=v6VaOF556Pr7g589kIesFWQ_lRg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W19LUJWlHoPGiwLxhoGYCQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Rufe%20Persful&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 September 2012|year= 2009|publisher= AuthorHouse Press|isbn=9781425995881|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was involved in a brutal fight with Francis Keating, a former inmate of Atlanta who called him a "shotgun son of a bitch" and Persful was sent to solitary confinement in D-Block.&lt;ref name="WardKassebaum2009"/&gt; Persful became one of the most guarded inmates of Alcatraz due to his reputation and was carefully watched during dining to ensure he was not assaulted by his fellow inmates. Nonetheless, Persful continued to be heavily abused and in fear of his life, in September 1936 he sent a letter to [[James A. Johnston]], the prison warden, informing him of what was common knowledge in the prison of his past exploits and why the fellow inmates resented him, asking for a transfer to McNeil Island. His request was rejected.&lt;ref name="WardKassebaum2009"/&gt;

Rufe's paranoia, while in Alcatraz, was also due the strict silence enforced there by Warden [[James A. Johnston|Johnston]]; the silence rule was resented by many other inmates also. As a result, some nine months later (after his request for transfer to McNeil Island was rejected) during the course of duties when he was working in the garage area to sweep and clean trash he took out an axe from a fire truck  parked in the building and cut off four fingers of the left hand to seek attention and get transferred to the medical center in [[Springfield, Missouri]] on grounds of insanity. The guard and another inmate took away the hatchet from Rufes and put a [[tourniquet]] on his wrist to stop the bleeding. He was said to have grinned maniacally as he sliced his four fingers off. Persful was taken to the [[Alcatraz Hospital|prison hospital]], where he had to be forcibly restrained as the staff treated him, as he had a desire to cut off his other hand and his feet.&lt;ref name="WardKassebaum2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Courtney 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Prison&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/rs3.htm|title= Prison Routine|publisher= Alcatrazhistory.com |accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the sequence of this incident is disputed as it is also mentioned that Persful's fingers were cut off due to his hand getting jammed while closing the workshop door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ca-alcatraz5.html|title= Alcatraz – Page 5|publisher= Legends of America |accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the 1979, [[Don Siegel]]-[[Clint Eastwood]] film ''[[Escape from Alcatraz (film)|Escape from Alcatraz]]'', Persful's hand mutilation was enacted in the movie. This scene is disputed due to the fact that the lead up to the [[June 1962 escape from Alcatraz]] actually took place nearly 25 years later, and neither [[Frank Morris (prisoner)|Frank Morris]] or [[Clarence Anglin|Clarence]] and [[John Anglin (criminal)|John Anglin]] were imprisoned at Alcatraz when the Persful incident occurred. Following this incident a policy change (one of the very few made during the  history of the prison) in the prison rules of Alcatraz regarding silence was made for the good.&lt;ref name="WardKassebaum2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Prison/&gt; As the incident received publicity in the news media, [[James V. Bennett]], the then Director of the Bureau of Prisons, clarified that the incident was of mental derangement of Rufes.&lt;ref name=" Odier 1982"&gt;{{cite book|last= Odier |first= L'Image .|title= The Rock: a history of Alcatraz : the fort/the prison|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=95HaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Rufe+Persful&amp;dq=Rufe+Persful&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XcEvRbFWq1&amp;sig=IJYwVIAgPSC38k5ELtbBedyfIPY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IoVLUPyoMsTTigKFjYDQCQ&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCA|accessdate=8 September 2012|date= 28 July 2009|publisher= L'Image Odier |isbn=9780961163204|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the months following the mutilation incident, Persful's mental health continued to decline; he would frequently complain of there being an [[alligator]] living in his cell and he attempted to make nooses out of bed linen and towels to hang himself. He was assessed by the prison psychiatrist to be suffering from ''[[Dementia praecox]]'', [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]] type and in January 1938 he was sent to [[Springfield Medical Centre]] via [[Fort Leavenworth]].&lt;ref name="WardKassebaum2009"/&gt; He was also called the most "wanton killer" as his killings covered six men, his wife and child and probably many more. It is also conjectured that he killed three men purposely as they were black prisoners.&lt;ref name=" McIntyre 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last= McIntyre |first= D. |title= Adjustment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=95HaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Rufe+Persful&amp;dq=Rufe+Persful&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XcEvRbFWq1&amp;sig=IJYwVIAgPSC38k5ELtbBedyfIPY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IoVLUPyoMsTTigKFjYDQCQ&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCA|accessdate=8 September 2012|year= 1999|publisher= D&amp;M Publishers Incorporated |isbn=9780000012340|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was transferred then to McNeil where he was heavily booed in the dining hall just days after arriving as the word quickly got out of his history amongst inmates. He was closely monitored by guards at McNeil Island, and his job was to clean the cells after the inmates had departed on their own tasks to avoid confrontation with them. In November 1941, the warden of McNeil requested a transfer back to Alcatraz in confinement in D-Block, but it was declined due to him likely becoming insane again. Several months later attempts were made to place him in a group cell at McNeil but his cell mates warned staff that they would murder him, so he was sent back to his single cell. Persful was beaten 18 months later when a fellow prisoner was given access to his cell during his cleaning duties, after which Persful requested permanent locking inside his cell for the rest of the duration of his sentence. The warden declined his request and he was beaten a further two times when security relapsed before being released from prison in April 1948.&lt;ref name="WardKassebaum2009"/&gt;

After release from prison, Persful moved in with a relative in Gary, Indiana, and, scarred both emotionally and physically by his torturous prison experiences, was never convicted of a crime for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="WardKassebaum2009"/&gt; He died in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ancestry.ca/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv=1&amp;db=USPenAlcatrazCA&amp;rank=1&amp;new=1&amp;MSAV=1&amp;msT=1&amp;gss=angs-d&amp;gsfn=rufe&amp;gsln=persful&amp;uidh=ah6&amp;pcat=36&amp;fh=0&amp;h=284&amp;recoff=8+9+21+64]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Howard Sloan''' (born September 7, 1944) is an American [[chess player]], [[publisher]] and [[political figure]] based in New York City. In 2006, Sloan served on the Executive Board of the [[United States Chess Federation]]. In 2006 Sloan was elected as an officer to the [[Manhattan Libertarian Party]] County Committee as Director of Media Relations.
 
In 1970, Sloan established a registered broker-dealer that traded over-the-counter stocks and bonds. Sloan had no formal legal training but orally argued a case before the Supreme Court after litigating against the Securities and Exchange Commission over policies regarding the trading of penny stocks. The Court ruled in his favor, 9–0. Sloan is the last non-lawyer to argue before the court.
He has run unsuccessfully or attempted to run for several other city, state and national government political offices, including for President of the United States.

==Early life and education==
Sloan was born in [[Richmond, Virginia]] in 1944 to attorney Leroy Bayfield Sloan, who was a [[Special agent]] in the [[Audit]] Division of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and to [[child psychiatrist]] Dr. Marjorie Jacobson Sloan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anusha.com/dr-marj.htm |title=Dr. Marjorie Jacobson Sloan, June 27, 1937 – May 16, 2002 |publisher=anusha.com |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anusha.com/leroy.htm |title=Leroy Bayfield Sloan, May 2, 1910 – January 19, 1986 |publisher=anusha.com |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His family later moved to [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]], where he graduated from [[E.C. Glass High School]]. Sloan studied chess from an early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sam |last=Sloan |url=http://www.anusha.com/1sloan-2.htm |title=Qualification of Sam Sloan for USCF President |publisher=anusha.com |date=June 22, 1996 |accessdate=August 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloan left Lynchburg in 1962 to study at [[University of California, Berkeley]]; he majored in [[mathematics]] and later switched to [[criminology]], but he left Berkeley in 1967 and did not graduate. At Berkeley he became one of the leaders of the Anti-War movement and promoted a branch of the [[Sexual Freedom League]]. He held more than forty sexually liberal parties in Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michelle |last=Pitcher |url=http://www.dailycal.org/2015/02/13/brief-history-sexual-liberation-orgies-uc-berkeley/ |title=A brief history of sexual liberation, orgies at UC Berkeley |newspaper=The Daily Californian |date=February 13, 2015 |accessdate=June 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkeleyplaques.org/e-plaque/sexual-freedom-league/ |title=Berkeley Historical Plaque Project - Sexual Freedom League |accessdate=August 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sam |last=Sloan |url=http://www.anusha.com/lived.htm |title=Places where Sam Sloan has lived |accessdate=August 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After leaving Berkeley, Sloan worked two years for the [[Wall Street]] [[investment banking]] firm of [[Hayden, Stone &amp; Co.]] in the [[over-the-counter trading]] department. In 1970, he established Samuel H. Sloan &amp; Company, a registered [[broker-dealer]] primarily trading over-the-counter stocks and bonds. The [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) brought civil actions against Sloan &amp; Co. in 1971–5 alleging he had failed to maintain adequate books and records. In 1975, the SEC revoked Sloan's broker-dealer registration. After years of litigation, Sloan in 1978 prevailed in the U.S. Supreme Court. Sloan argued the case ''[[pro se]]''. The opposing attorney was [[Harvey Pitt]], who was later Chairman of the SEC from 2001 to 2003. Sloan won before the U.S. Supreme Court 9–0, concerning his claim that the "tacking" of 10-day summary suspension orders for an indefinite period was an abuse of the agency's authority and a deprivation of due process. Sloan is the last non-lawyer to argue before the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.findlaw.com/US/436/103.html |title=SEC v. Samuel H.

Sloan has written in 1981 a lexicon of [[Khowar language|Khowar]], a language spoken in [[Chitral]], Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anusha.com/khow-dic.htm |title=Khowar English Dictionary |publisher=Anusha.com |accessdate=August 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sloan had a minor role in a 1984 commercially produced film, ''[[Mahjong hōrōki]]'', that later became a video game, ''[[Mahjong video game|Mahjong Hōrōki Classic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzMNHdZMQls%7cSam |title=Mahjong Hourouki |accessdate=May 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1994, Sloan has operated [[Ishi Press]].

Sloan is a chess journalist{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} and author. He claims to have traveled to 78 countries, primarily attending chess tournaments. During a speech on April 29, 2006 at a Libertarian Party of New York's convention Sam Sloan has claimed to have "won the World Championship of [[Chinese Chess]] in Beijing, China, in 1988". He is rated an FM (Federation Master) by the World [[Xiangqi]] Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xiangqibowl.net/wxc/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=77&amp;Itemid=94 |title=Sam Sloan Xiangqi Game listing, XiangQi Masters Database, World Xiangqi Federation |accessdate=June 1, 2014 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sloan has competed in tournaments in Thai ([[Makrook]]) and Japanese ([[Shōgi]]) chess.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Election to USCF Board===
In July 2006, Sloan was elected to the Executive Board of the [[United States Chess Federation]] (USCF). He advocated a major expansion of [[Scholastic chess in the United States|scholastic chess]], stating that the USCF should establish a program to certify school chess teachers. He criticized the USCF's recent move from [[New Windsor, New York]] to [[Crossville, Tennessee]]. As second-place finisher (out of five) in the special election, Sloan was elected to a one-year term on the board (the first-place finisher received a three-year term). Sloan's term of service began in August 2006. In 2007, Sloan ran for reelection to the USCF Executive Board, but was unsuccessful, finishing a distant ninth out of ten candidates. On October 2, 2007, Sloan filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] seeking to overturn the results of the 2007 USCF election, and alleging that more than 2,000 obscene "Fake Sam Sloan" newsgroup postings prior to the election had been made by a rival candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dylan |last=Loeb McClain |url=http://gambit.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/drive-to-recall-member-of-chess-federations-board-is-under-way/ |title=Drive to Recall Member of Chess Federation's Board Is Under Way |date=March 23, 2008 |accessdate=June 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 28, 2008, US District Judge Denny Chin dismissed the suit [[prejudice (legal procedure)|with prejudice]] pursuant to [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] 12(b)(1), 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule12.htm |title=Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: Rule 12 |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] affirmed the dismissal but modified it, saying that it was "without prejudice" as the case had not gone to a hearing.

===USENET postings incident===
On April 3, 2008, posts appeared on [[USENET]], apparently placed by Sloan, claiming that some of his websites had been closed down by law enforcement in [[Amherst County, Virginia]], apparently because Sloan [[doxxing|listed the home addresses]] of parties involved in his long-running but [[mootness|moot]] child custody dispute involving his daughter. The USENET posting mentions County investigator Christopher Smith. During that same time, Smith was conducting a broad campaign against Internet crime in the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legalspring.com/articles/misc-legal/20080403/568227_Amherst-County-Sheri.html |title=Amherst County Sheriff shuts down Sam Sloan's websites |date=April 3, 2008 |accessdate=June 1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713195419/http://www.legalspring.com/articles/misc-legal/20080403/568227_Amherst-County-Sheri.html |archivedate=July 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.justia.com/codes/virginia/2006/toc1802000/18.2-186.4.html |title=§ 2006 Code of Virginia § 18.2-186.4 - Use of a person\'s identity with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass; penalty |publisher=justia.com |accessdate=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mentions in 2011 media===
In a 2011 book about [[Bobby Fischer]], [[Frank Brady (writer)|Frank Brady]] wrote "Aided by an eidetic memory, [Sloan] was the last non-lawyer to argue a case before the United States Supreme Court – a case he won. Bobby trusted him."{{sfn |Brady |2011 |page=173}}

Three dialogues with Sloan are incorporated in the 2011 documentary ''[[Bobby Fischer Against the World]]''.

Sloan tied for the lead in the 3rd round of the 2011 World Championship of [[Chinese Chess]] (the total number of rounds or his final result was not stated).

Sloan won the 2011 [[Silver Medal]] in Senior Division (of two entries) at the [[World Memory Championship]] in [[Guangzhou]], China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldmemorychampionship.com/ |title=The Official Website for the World's Greatest Test of Memory Founded in 1991 by Tony Buzan &amp; Raymond Keene OBE The Official website of the World Memory Championships |publisher=Worldmemorychampionship.com |date=October 26, 1991 |accessdate=February 1, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203220325/http://worldmemorychampionship.com/ |archivedate=February 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-memory-statistics.com/competition.php?id=wsmc2011 |title=World Senior Memory Championship 2011 |accessdate=June 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Xiangqi championships===
Sloan competed in the [[World Xiangqi Championship|World Championship of Chinese Chess]] in 2011 and 2013 and 2015 and 2017, held in [[Jakarta]], and in [[Huizhou]], [[China]] and in [[Munich]], [[Germany]] and in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] respectively.

==Political campaigns==
In an April 30, 2006, email to [[Michael Badnarik]]'s [[Michael Badnarik presidential campaign, 2004|2004 presidential campaign]] mailing list, an individual claiming to be Sloan announced his intention to seek the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] nomination for [[Governor of New York]] State.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}  From 2002 to 2006, Sloan had been active in the [[Libertarian Party of New York]] attempting to influence its policy agenda and candidate nominations.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Later in 2006, Sloan was elected as an officer to the [[Manhattan Libertarian Party]] County Committee as Director of Media Relations. He was not re-elected to that position in 2007. He was a delegate to the [[2008 Libertarian National Convention]] and the [[2010 Libertarian National Convention]]. On May 25, 2008 in [[Denver]], Colorado, Sloan was nominated to the National Committee of the Libertarian Party and made a speech addressing the [[Libertarian National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|XBYdUvz4DPg|Video: Sam Sloan Interviewed on the Harold Channer Show}} June 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloan made a bid for governor in the [[New York gubernatorial election, 2010]], facing off against attorney [[Warren Redlich]] and former madam [[Kristin M. Davis]]. Sloan, by his own admission, was not popular within the [[Libertarian Party of New York]] and did not expect to win the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Karlin |first=Rick |date=April 23, 2010 |url=http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/25367/tomorrow-three-way-libertarian-smack-down-in-albany/ |title=Tomorrow: Three-way Libertarian smack-down in Albany! |work=Albany Times Union |accessdate=April 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426135808/http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/25367/tomorrow-three-way-libertarian-smack-down-in-albany/ |archivedate=April 26, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He testified that a faction in the party who opposed Redlich's nomination needed another candidate. Sloan eventually lost the nomination to Redlich in a two-way battle, by a vote of 27 for Redlich and 17 for Sloan, after Davis refused to show up at the convention. Despite his failure to secure the nomination, Sloan was the first to submit petitions to the board of elections with the Libertarian Party line, which effectively gives him the nomination; the down-ballot selections on Sloan's petitions are identical to those confirmed by the party committee. However, because his petitions failed to contain the requisite 15,000 signatures, the nomination went to Redlich; it has been speculated that Sloan used the ploy to file a lawsuit against Redlich in his long-running dispute with the state Libertarian Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilder |first=Kimberly |date=August 13, 2010 |url=http://wilderside.wordpress.com/2010/08/12/libertarian-sam-sloan-files-for-governor-of-ny/ |title=Libertarian Sam Sloan files for Governor of NY |accessdate=August 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the November elections, [[Roger Stone]] Davis's campaign manager, claims that Sloan fed him information that Stone passed on to a group entitled "People for a Safer New York", who created a flyer labeling Redlich a "sexual predator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stone |first=Roger |date=November 4, 2010 |url=http://stonezone.com/article.php?id=375 |title=Libertarian Payback |work=StoneZone.com |accessdate=November 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718094041/http://stonezone.com/article.php?id=375 |archivedate=July 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Sloan announced his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's [[2012 Libertarian National Convention|2012 presidential nomination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2012/01/sam-sloan-announces-for-libertarian-party-presidential-nomination/ | title=Sam Sloan Announces For Libertarian Party Presidential Nomination | work=Independent Political Report | date=January 16, 2012 | accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://images.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?P20004537 | title=Principal Campaign Committee:Committee to Elect Sam Sloan | publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC) | date=January 2012 | accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost the nomination to [[Gary Johnson]].

In November 2013, Sloan was on the ballot for the [[New York City mayoral election, 2013]], as an independent under the ''War Veterans'' line; he received 166 votes (0.02%, or 1/5,000 of the total vote).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vote.nyc.ny.us/downloads/pdf/results/2013/2013GeneralElection/00001100000Citywide%20Mayor%20Citywide%20Recap.pdf|title=Statement and Return Report for Certification - General Election - November 5, 2013 |publisher=Board of Elections in the City of New York|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyccfb.info/public/voter-guide/general_2013/intro_mayor.aspx|title=2013 NYC Voter Guide: Mayor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Sloan ran for the Democratic nomination for [[New York's 15th congressional district]], against incumbent [[José E. Serrano]]. He lost the primary election by 91% to 9%.  Later that summer, Sloan attempted to submit petitions for the [[New York gubernatorial election, 2014|2014 gubernatorial election]], one for the Democratic primary (with Nenad Bach as the running mate) and another an "ambush" of the Libertarian Party line similar to the one he attempted in 2010 (with [[Tom Stevens (politician)|Tom Stevens]] as the running mate). Both petitions were ruled invalid.&lt;ref name=rem&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.ny.gov:8080/reports/rwservlet?cmdkey=whofiled |title=Candidate Petition List |publisher=elections.ny.gov|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2015, Sloan filed with the FEC to run for the [[Democratic Party presidential candidates, 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/515/201509300300024515/201509300300024515.pdf|title= Sam Sloan FEC filing|date=September 29, 2015|work=FEC|accessdate=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/press/resources/2016presidential_form2pty.shtml|title=2016 Presidential Form 2 Filers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a candidate for US President, Sloan attempted to run paid television ads on [[KCCI]], the major [[TV station]] in [[Des Moines Iowa]], and [[WMUR TV]], the major TV station in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]. Both of these TV stations are owned by [[Hearst Television]]. Sloan ran as an [[anti-war]] candidate opposing the US wars in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]]. Both TV stations refused to run the Sloan paid TV ads on the ground that Sloan had failed to meet his burden to substantiate bona fide candidacy for the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|Office of the President of the United States]] under the threshold established by the [[Communications Act of 1934]] and [[regulations]] of the [[Federal Communications Commission]]. Sloan then sued in the [[United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire]], in [[Concord, New Hampshire]]. Sloan also named as a defendant [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]] for allowing only two [[Democratic Party (United States)]] Candidates, [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Bernie Sanders]] into the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] TV Debates thus making it virtually impossible for any other Democratic Party candidate to run. Sloan alleged that [[Communications Act of 1934]] and [[Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations]] 47 USC 315 requires federally licensed broadcasters to provide all candidates running for [[public office]] [[equal opportunity]] to utilize the broadcast station. Judge [[Paul J. Barbadoro]], [[U.S. District Judge]] disagreed and found and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] affirmed that there is no [[private right of action]] under this statute and therefore Sloan's case was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;''Sloan v. Hearst Media Co.'' (1st Cir. 2016), Court of Appeals Docket #: 16-1885.&lt;/ref&gt; He was only on the [[United States presidential election in New Hampshire, 2016|New Hampshire]] ballot and received 15 votes. He lost to [[Hillary Clinton]] on July 26, 2016.

In 2016, Sloan ran in the Democratic primary for US Congress in the [[New York's 13th congressional district]] (upper Manhattan/lower Bronx area).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uselections.com/ny/ny.htm |title=2016 New York Elections, Primary, Candidates, Races and Voting |accessdate=June 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Patrick |last=Rocchio |url=http://www.bxtimes.com/stories/2016/25/25-13cd-2016-06-17-bx.html |title=13th Congressional district primary June 28 |date=June 17, 2016 |accessdate=June 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary was held June 28, 2016 and he received 197 votes (0.46%), placing 8th in a field of 9 candidates and losing to [[Adriano Espaillat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nyenr.elections.state.ny.us/ |title=NYS Board of Elections Unofficial Election Night Results |date=June 29, 2016 |accessdate=June 29, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107220743/http://nyenr.elections.state.ny.us/ |archivedate=November 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite opening a campaign account for another run for governor in 2018 (which received no donations), Sloan did not submit any petitions for the [[New York gubernatorial election, 2018|2018 gubernatorial election]] on any party line.

==Personal life==
Sloan has been married three times. Sloan's second wife, Honzagool, was a native of [[Chitral]] ([[Pakistan]]) and they had a daughter named Shamema. Sloan and Honzagool soon separated and Sloan left New York for Virginia with Shamema, leaving Shamema in the care of a Virginia couple, while Honzagool returned to Chitral. Sloan was subsequently locked into a child custody struggle, which lasted several years, with that Virginia couple over that same daughter. On September 5, 1991, during an attempt to regain custody of his daughter Shamema, Sloan was arrested. Sloan was convicted of attempted [[parental child abduction|abduction]] of Shamema and spent 18 months in state prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anusha.com/judgego.htm |title=92 Civ. 2388 (RJD) Report and recommendation |publisher=anusha.com |date=June 28, 1993 |first=Marilyn |last=Go |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courts.state.va.us/courts/ |title=Virginia Court System |accessdate=June 29, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521025038/http://www.courts.state.va.us/courts/ |archivedate=May 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }} On menu, pick Case Status Information/Circuit Court/Case Information.

'''Sara Grant''', RSCJ (19 December 1922 – 2002) was a British [[Indologist]], Christian missionary, and one of the pioneers of [[interreligious dialogue]] in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=mid/&gt; She came to India in 1956, as a missionary and member of the [[Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus|Religious of the Sacred Heart of Jesus]], became actively engaged in [[interreligious dialogue]] in [[India]]. In time, she became a leading figure in the [[inculturation]] (imbibing local cultures) movement that was started in India by Roman Catholic priest Fr [[Richard De Smet]], SJ in the early 1970s, with whom she was closely associated with. Her association with [[Swami Abhishiktananda]], further led to working on the [[Advaita Vedanta]] ([[Nondualism]]) teachings of Hindu philosopher [[Adi Sankara]], as revealed in her spiritual autobiography, ''Towards an Alternative Theology: Confessions of a Non-dualist Christian'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vatican Cardinal’s thumbs-up for Indianisation of Catholic church  Published: Saturday, |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_vatican-cardinals-thumbs-up-for-indianisation-of-catholic-church_1500454 |publisher=[[DNA (newspaper)|DNA]] |date=29 January 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She taught philosophy in Mumbai and Pune for several years, and remained spent many years as co-[[acharya]] of the [[Christian Ashram Movement|Christa Prema Seva Ashram]] in [[Pune]], which combines the Hindu [[ashram]] and [[sannyasa]] model and [[Christian monasticism]].&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Sara Grant was born to [[Scottish people|Scottish]] parents in [[Shrewsbury, England]], in 1922, and received her early education at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, [[Brighton]].

Having converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] after finishing school at the age of 19, she joined the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Jesus order and became a [[novitiate]]. She moved to countryside during the war, and later to [[Oxford University]], where she studied  classics and philosophy and where one of her mentors was noted British author and philosopher, [[Iris Murdoch]], herself then in the throes of a [[religious conversion]].&lt;ref name=mid&gt;[http://monasticdialog.com/a.php?id=247 In Memoriam: Sr. Sara Grant, RSCJ (1922-2002)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219033149/http://monasticdialog.com/a.php?id=247 |date=19 December 2010 }} Monastic Interreligious Dialogue (MID).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[Nun#Distinction between a nun and a religious sister|Sr]] Sara Grant came as a missionary to India in 1956, to head the newly formed Department of Philosophy at [[Sophia College]] (University of Mumbai), Mumbai run by Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, here she taught for many years. Under the influence and guidance of Fr [[Richard De Smet]], SJ, she studied [[Sanskrit]] and did a doctorate in the [[University of Bombay]] on the concept of relation in [[Adi Sankaracarya]], (ca. 700 C.E.), the authoritative Hindu exponent of the doctrine of non-duality ([[Advaita]]). Here she also became close friends with [[Swami Abhishiktananda]], a French Benedictine monk, whose biography she later published in 1998, as ''Swami Abhishiktananda: The man and his message''.&lt;ref name=app/&gt; In the coming years, she drew upon philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]], to embarked upon a path of reconciling Indian and Christian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Review: ''The Winter Sun: Notes on a Vocation'' by Fanny Howe |url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/harvardreview/OnlineJournal/HRO_2/reviews/HoweDavis.html |date= |publisher=[[Harvard Review]], Issue 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work with Sankara, and focus on the understanding of [[Advaita Vedanta]], culminated in the drawing parallels with Christian doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian inculturation in India|author=Paul M.

She became a member of the [[ecumenical]] religious community (Anglican and Catholic) of the innovative [[Christian Ashram Movement|Christa Prema Seva Ashram]] (CPS), [[Shivajinagar, Pune|Shivajinagar]], [[Pune]] - India. During these years, she also taught [[Indian philosophy]] at [[Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth]], Pune, the Catholic [[Pontifical]] Institute of Philosophy and Theology.

She was invited on occasion to lecture on Sankaracarya at [[Sivananda Ashram]], Rishikesh, where she reports that her interpretation of Sankara was well received.

Sara Grant was one of the most active Catholics in the area of interreligious dialogue in the second half of the twentieth century.  She liked to describe herself as a '[[Nondualism|Non-Dualist]] Christian' (see the bibliography below).

Her spiritual autobiography, ''Towards an Alternative Theology: Confessions of a Non-Dualist Christian''  was published in 1991. It was originally the Teape Lectures delivered at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1989. In 1993 she received the first "Ba-Bapu Puraskar" Prize by [[Gandhian]]s in Pune, followed by "eminent Ecumenical Educator Award", by the All-India Association for Christian Higher Education.&lt;ref name=app&gt;[http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1233&amp;context=jhcs&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.in%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dsara%2520grant%2520india%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D10%26sqi%3D2%26ved%3D0CFsQFjAJ%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fdigitalcommons.butler.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1233%2526context%253Djhcs%26ei%3DrhhHT4DmHIusrAegssW4Dw%26usg%3DAFQjCNHNtFqksscO1e_iBirnermAEsvtvA%26cad%3Drja#search=%22sara%20grant%20india%22Sara Grant, RSCJ - An Appreciation by BradleyJ: Malkovsky] Hindu-Christian Studies Bulletin 13, page 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Schuyler Garrison Chapin''' (February 13, 1923 – March 7, 2009) was a General Manager of the [[Metropolitan Opera]], and later Commissioner of Cultural Affairs for [[New York City]] during the administration of Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]]. He famously noted of his work, that: "There is nothing simple in the world of the arts" (New York Times, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Wakin, Daniel J. ''Schuyler G. Chapin, Stalwart Champion of the Arts in New York, Dies at 86.'' New York Times. 9 Mar. 2009, A21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
Schuyler Garrison Chapin was born on February 13, 1923. He was the son of Lindley Hoffman Paul Chapin (1888–1938) and Leila Howard ([[née]] Burden) (1899–1967).&lt;ref&gt;Harvard College (1780 -), Class of 1911. ''Decennial Report.'' Pub. Four Seasons Co., 1921, pp. 70 – 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapin was a ninth generation descendant of Captain [[Philip Pieterse Schuyler]] (1628–1683), who settled in [[New Netherland]] around 1650, with his brother David Pietersen Schuyler.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph, Florence A. ''Schuyler Genealogy: A Compendium of Sources Pertaining to the Schuyler Families in America Prior to 1800.'' Pub. Friends of Schuyler Mansion, 1992, Vol. 1, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Chapin's maternal pedigree extends to include: Priv. Isaac Kingsland (1710–1803); Third Battalion, of the New Jersey Continental Line, who married 3 Jun. 1741 Joanna ([[née]] Schuyler);&lt;ref&gt;''Lineage Book.''

== Career ==
While still a teenager, in the 1930s, he began accompanying millionaire widow and former actress [[Eleanor Robson Belmont|Eleanor Belmont]] to the Metropolitan Opera.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/31/opinion/31opart.html?th&amp;emc=th New York Times article].&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Millbrook School]] in 1940, where he was very active in the performing and musical arts,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.millbrook.org/podium/default.aspx?t=51709 Film interview (2006) about his experience at Millbrook School].&lt;/ref&gt; however, he did not graduate from high school, nor college, but was the recipient of numerous university honors. He became a pilot during [[World War II]].

By 1953, he had become [[Jascha Heifetz]]'s tour manager. Around this time, he also befriended [[Leonard Bernstein]], several of whose live recordings, including the Grammy award-winning ''Beethoven's Birthday'' (1970), Chapin produced.

In 1963, he was named vice-president of [[Lincoln Center]] and co-founded the [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]] in 1969.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|first=William|last=Grimes|title=William F. May, 95, Dies; Helped Found Film Society |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/business/william-f-may-95-dies-helped-found-lincoln-center-film-society.html?_r=1 |work=[[New York Times]] |publisher= |date=2011-09-20|accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, he accepted the position of General Manager of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] after the previous GM, [[Göran Gentele]], died in a car accident before the opening of his first season. Chapin stayed on at the Met for four years, subsequently becoming Dean of [[Columbia University]]'s Graduate School of the Arts.  During Chapin’s tenure at Columbia, enrollment doubled, and he raised $7 million and strengthened the fine-arts curriculum. He remained there for 10 years, being kept on as Dean emeritus. He then moved on to the job of vice president of [[Steinway &amp; Sons]] before becoming the cultural affairs commissioner of New York City from 1994 to 2001.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;

In 2002, he was awarded [[France]]'s [[Légion d'honneur]], 82 years after his father; L. H. Paul Chapin, a World War I liaison officer between General Pershing and Marshall Foch, received the same honor.  He also wrote several books, including ''Leonard Bernstein: Notes From a Friend'' and was also a Board Member Emeritus In Memoriam at [[The Center for Arts Education]].&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;

==Personal life==
On March 15, 1947, he married his first wife, Elizabeth Steinway (1925-1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff|title=Elizabeth Chapin, Arts Panel Member And Volunteer, 68|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/18/obituaries/elizabeth-chapin-arts-panel-member-and-volunteer-68.html|accessdate=11 April 2016|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=18 June 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinway was the daughter of [[Theodore E.

Chronicle Books, 2002, pp. 24 – 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Steinways were descendants of [[Henry E. Steinway]] (the founder of [[Steinway &amp; Sons]]). Chapin's best man was his uncle by marriage, [[Francis Biddle]], the former [[United States Attorney General]].&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt; Together, they had four sons:

*[[Miles Chapin]] (born December 6, 1954)
After his wife died in 1993, Chapin met and married his second wife, divorcee Catia Zoullas Mortimer, in 1995.

'''María de San Antonio Lorenzo y Fuentes''' or '''Sor María de San Antonino''' (August 5, 1665 in [[Garachico]], [[Tenerife]] – May 10, 1741 in [[Puerto de la Cruz]], Tenerife) was a [[Dominican Sisters|Dominican]] [[Religious sisters|religious sister]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[Mysticism|mystic]].

== Biography ==
Her life was written of by Francisco Martínez Puentes, the priest of her native town, Garachico, a city in the north of the island of Tenerife.&lt;ref name=A&gt;[http://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2017/03/galeria-misticos-tinerfenos/ Los 4 místicos tinerfeños]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sr. María de San Antonio came from a wealthy family,&lt;ref name=B&gt;[http://www.canarizame.com/2013/05/23/un-viejo-convento/ Un viejo convento – Convento de las monjas Catalinas en el Puerto de la Cruz.]&lt;/ref&gt; professed as a Dominican nun in the ''Convento de Nuestra Señora de las Nieves'' of the city of Puerto de la Cruz (the convent disappeared by fire in 1925). This convent temple was in front of the ''Parroquia de Nuestra Señora de la Peña de Francia''.

The nun was given various gifts such as the reading of souls. According to popular tradition, Sor Maria was able to read the mind of a convent servant, named ''Felipa'', who prayed that God would lead her to purgatory after her death. The nun rebuked her, urging her to ask God to go to [[heaven]] instead of [[purgatory]].&lt;ref name=A/&gt; Another miracle attributed to the nun happened when a mason who worked in the convent fell into the void, rushing to the ground gently and swaying, without dying or suffering damage, since the workman had entrusted to the nun.

María de San Antonino died on May 10, 1741. According to the files, her body remained incorrupt and kept her blood fresh. The acts of exhumation and translation of her remains were verified when Monsignor [[Antonio Luis Folgueras y Sión]] was bishop of the [[Diocese of Tenerife]].&lt;ref name=B/&gt; Her body is not currently preserved, as it disappeared in the convent fire in 1925.

He worked in various casual jobs after his schooling had ended, including carrying chicken waste at a poultry farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Tito| last = Emmanuel| title = TB Joshua – 47 Happy Cheers| url = http://allafrica.com/stories/201006090681.html| work = All Africa| date = 2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He organised Bible studies for local children and attended evening school during this period.&lt;ref name="Correspondent"/&gt; Joshua attempted to join the Nigerian military but was thwarted due to a train breakdown that left him stranded en route to the military academy.

== The Synagogue, Church of All Nations (SCOAN) ==
Joshua wrote that in a heavenly vision he had received divine anointing and a covenant from God to start his ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Conor| last = Gaffey| title = Who Is TB Joshua, Nigeria's Mega Preacher Accused Of Criminal Negligence| url = http://europe.newsweek.com/who-tb-joshua-nigerias-mega-preacher-accused-criminal-negligence-426036 | work = Newsweek (Europe)| date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, Joshua founded the ministry organisation The Synagogue, Church of All Nations (SCOAN). According to the organisation, more than 15,000 members&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Celebrity Priests | url = http://www.economist.com/node/21558298 | work = The Economist | date = 2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; attend its weekly Sunday service; visitors from outside Nigeria are accommodated in the accommodation blocks constructed at the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vergadering.nu/mijnlagosreis/index-eng.html |title=The Synagogue Church of All Nations in Lagos, Nigeria ; Travel report of my visit to the Synagogue Church - March 13-22, 2007 |publisher=Vergadering.nu |accessdate=2015-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bennier.tripod.com/nigeria/report.htm |title=Report on TB Joshua, the man in the Synagogue |publisher=Bennier.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revivalinpower.com/archive/thekenyacrusade.html |title=revivalinpower |publisher=revivalinpower |date= |accessdate=2015-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A huge debate was stirred within Nigeria when the father of abducted school girl Ese Oruru stated his intention to take his daughter to T.B.

=== Anointing Water ===
Many have also claimed to be healed through 'Anointing Water' that has been prayed over by Joshua and given to those who are unable to physically attend his church in Lagos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Benson| last = Edjewhovbo| title = Curing Four Year Old Acid Victim| url = http://allafrica.com/stories/201007230244.html| work = Daily Independent| date = 2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first =  Nomsa| last = Ndlovu-Gherke| title = By Divine Connection| url = http://www.thevoicebw.com/2010/07/16/by-devine-connection/ | work = The Voice (Botswana)| date = 2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim they were protected from deadly incidents because they had the water with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Ihechuwku| last = Njoku| title = ‘How T.B Joshua’s morning water saved us from Bristow Helicopter crash’ | url = http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/10/how-t-b-joshuas-morning-water-saved-us-from-bristow-helicopter-crash/| work = Vanguard (Nigeria)| date = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Adenike| last = Orenuga| title = How T.B Joshua’s anointing water saved us from the Nyanya bomb blast – Survivors | url = http://dailypost.ng/2014/04/21/t-b-joshuas-anointing-water-saved-us-nyanya-bomb-blast-survivors/| work = Daily Post (Nigeria)| date = 2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, four people died in a stampede in Joshua's Ghanaian branch when an unadvertised service where it was being distributed drew huge crowds far beyond the churches capacity, bringing Ghana's capital city Accra almost to a standstill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first =  Afua | last = Hirsch | title = Celebrity Pastor Under Fire After Worshippers Die In Rush For 'Holy Water' | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/23/ghana-pastor-stampede-tbjoshua | work = The Guardian (UK)| date = 2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joshua also made headlines when he claimed his Anointing Water could cure the deadly disease [[Ebola]]. He subsequently sent 4,000 bottles of the water alongside a cash gift of $50,000 to the Ebola-stricken nation of [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first =  Abigail | last = Tracy | title = This Guy Sent Sierra Leone 4,000 Bottles of Holy Water to Cure Ebola | url = http://www.vocativ.com/world/nigeria-world/ebola-outbreak-2014/ | work = Vocativ | date = 2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first =  Andrew | last = Griffin | title = Millionaire Preacher Sends 4,000 Bottles Of Holy Water As Ebola Cure | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/millionaire-preacher-sends-4000-bottles-of-holy-water-as-ebola-cure-9674136.html | work = The Independent (UK)| date = 2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came after Lagos State Health officials visited Joshua, requesting him to publicly discourage Ebola victims from visiting his church for prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first =  Ruth | last = Moon | title = Why Nigerian Health Officials Turned to a Megachurch Pastor When Ebola Struck | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/november/ebola-tb-joshua-healing.html | work = Christianity Today | date = 2014-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Sierra Leonean politician later claimed the water helped stop the spread of the disease and cured several Ebola victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first =  Danielle | last = Ogbeche | title = TB Joshua’s ‘Anointing Water’ Reportedly Curing Ebola In Sierra Leone | url = http://dailypost.ng/2015/11/03/tb-joshuas-anointing-water-reportedly-curing-ebola-in-sierra-leone/ | work = Daily Post (Nigeria)| date = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign visits==
Although Joshua rarely goes abroad, he has travelled to Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Paraguay to hold 'crusades'.

===Paraguay===
In August 2017, Joshua held a Crusade in Paraguay at [[Estadio Defensores del Chaco]]. His visit caused a media storm when the Paraguayan parliament approved that the cleric be awarded with the ‘National Order of Merit’, the countries highest honour usually reserved only for its own citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = "Ilustre" profeta Joshua se presenta en Paraguay | url = http://www.lanacion.com.py/pais_edicion_impresa/2017/08/11/ilustre-profeta-joshua-se-presenta-en-paraguay/ | work = La Nacion (Paraguay)| date = 2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Testimonies from those who alleged they were healed through Joshua's prayers at the crusade made headlines in local media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = "Sentí cómo salía el espíritu de mi cuerpo" | url = http://www.cronica.com.py/2017/08/13/senti-salia-espiritu-cuerpo/ | work = Cronica (Paraguay)| date = 2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Caso travesti: es Antonio, ya no más Dexies | url = http://www.cronica.com.py/2017/08/24/caso-travesti-antonio-ya-no-mas-dexies/ | work = Cronica (Paraguay)| date = 2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = No curó sida, cáncer, ni a gays: surgen 3 testimonios ‘raros’ del ‘profeta’ Joshua | url = http://www.hoy.com.py/nacionales/no-cur-sida-cncer-ni-a-gays-surgen-3-testimonios-raros-del-profeta-joshua | work = HOY (Paraguay)| date = 2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconciliation efforts===
Joshua was involved in the meeting of the family of the late president of Liberia, [[Samuel Doe]], with the former warlord [[Prince Yormie Johnson]] who was responsible for Doe's death. During this meeting the family publicly forgave Johnson&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Son Forgives Man Who Butchered President Doe | url = http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=86&amp;art_id=qw97489038074B252 | work = IOL| date = 2000-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; who said it was through Joshua's prayers that he stopped drinking alcohol and turned to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Simon | last = Akam | title = The Comeback | url = https://newrepublic.com/article/95493/prince-johnson-liberia | work = New Republic (Liberia)| date = 2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cleric has also plays a prominent role in reconciling broken homes and restoring families torn apart by false accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = T.B Joshua exposes demons behind Ghana’s trokosi tradition | url = https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/religion/T-B-Joshua-exposes-demons-behind-Ghana-s-trokosi-tradition-504746 | work = Ghana Web (Ghana)| date = 2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Hamza Al-Mustapha]], the Chief Security Officer of former Nigerian President [[Sani Abacha]], was released after eleven years of imprisonment, his first port of call was to Joshua's church in acknowledgement of a 'prophecy' the cleric allegedly gave him when Abacha was still in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Al Mustapha Visits TB Joshua Straight From Kirikiri Prison | url= https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/140856-al-mustapha-visits-t-b-joshua-straight-from-kirikiri-prison.html |work= Premium Times (Nigeria) |date= 2013-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged MH370 prophecy ===
SCOAN released a video claiming that TB Joshua predicted the [[Malaysian Airlines MH370]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.charismanews.com/world/43136-did-nigerian-pastor-s-prophecy-predict-malaysian-airline-disappearance |title= Did Nigerian Pastor's Prophecy Predict Malaysian Airliner Disappearance? |last= |first= |date = |work= |access-date= |via= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prophecy received a lot of attention on social media and its accompanying YouTube video amassed over 1 million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first= Simi |last= John |title = Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370: Clip of Nigerian Preacher 'Predicting Disappearance' Goes Viral [VIDEO] |url= http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370-clip-nigerian-preacher-predicting-disappearance-goes-viral-1440107 |work= International Business Times (UK) |date= 2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Terrorist attacks ===
Several terrorist attacks perpetrated by [[ISIS]], [[Al-Qaeda]] affiliates and [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] militants have allegedly been predicted by Joshua, including the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Prophet TB Joshua Allegedly Predicted Paris Attack in 2013 | url = http://allafrica.com/stories/201511162028.html |work= Accra Report (Ghana) |date= 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Garissa University College attack]] in Kenya,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first= Mark |last= Yapching |title= Church Claims TB Joshua Predicted Kenya Terror Attack in 2012 |url= http://www.christiantoday.com/article/church.claims.tb.joshua.predicted.kenya.terror.attack.in.2012/51520.htm |work= Christian Today (UK) |date= 2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[2016 Ouagadougou attacks|Ouagadougou hotel siege]] in Burkina Faso&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= How TB Joshua Prophesied Burkina Faso Terrorists Siege  |url= http://citifmonline.com/2016/01/16/how-tb-joshua-prophesied-burkina-faso-terrorists-siege-video/ |work= Citi FM (Ghana) |date= 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2016 Brussels Bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= WATCH: TB Joshua Predicted The Brussels Terror Attacks |url= http://www.news24.com.ng/National/News/watch-tb-joshua-predicted-the-brussels-terror-attacks-20160323 |work= News 24 (Nigeria) |date= 2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also claimed that he predicted the Boston bombing attacks in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first = Dorcas | last = Efe Mensah | title = TB Joshua Prophesied About Boston Bombings In January | url = http://world.myjoyonline.com/pages/us/201304/104578.php | work = My Joy Online (Ghana) | date = 2013-04-16 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130503173252/http://world.myjoyonline.com/pages/us/201304/104578.php | archivedate = 2013-05-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ghana terror attack ===
Joshua's alleged prophecy in April 2016 that an impending terror attack would befall Ghana made national headlines in the West African nation and led the national police to issue a statement calling for the general public to be calm and vigilant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Police Urge Calm Over Terror Prophecy |url= http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Police-urge-calm-over-terror-prophecy-430036 |work= Ghana Web (Ghana) |date= 2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 600 foreigners reportedly cancelled their visits to Ghana in the wake of the statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = T.B Joshua scares off IMF delegation, 600 foreign visitors to Ghana | url = http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/T-B-Joshua-scares-off-IMF-delegation-600-foreign-visitors-to-Ghana-432691 | work = Ghana Web (Ghana)| date = 2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, a captured Malian terrorist confessed that his group had planned to target Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Malian 'Terrorist' Confirms Planned Terror Attack in Ghana |url= http://allafrica.com/stories/201604140231.html |work= All Africa |date= 2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US election prophecy===
Joshua incorrectly predicted that [[Hillary Clinton]] would win the [[2016 US election]]. After this prophecy failed to materialise, with [[Donald Trump]] winning the election, Joshua stated that he was referring to Clinton's win in the popular vote and any misinterpretation was due to a lack of "spiritual understanding".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://punchng.com/trump-you-need-spiritual-understanding-to-interpret-my-prophesy-tb-joshua/ |title= Trump: You need spiritual understanding to interpret my prophesy - TB Joshua |last=Abayomi |first=John |date= 13 November 2016 |work= |newspaper= Punch Newspapers |language= |access-date= 12 December 2016 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 Zimbabwe coup===
A video of Joshua predicting "the military" of an undisclosed Southern African nation embarrassing, killing or capturing "a President or Vice-President ... or the First Lady of that nation‚” surfaced on social media after the statement, which was made and recorded in August 2014, was interpreted as a prophecy of the 2017 coup against Zimbabwe's long-term leader [[Robert Mugabe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = James | last = Thompson | title = Did Nigerian Prophet TB Joshua Prophesy Mugabe's Removal? | url = https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/africa/2017-11-16-did-nigerian-prophet-tb-joshua-prophesy-mugabes-removal/ | work = Mail &amp; Guardian (South Africa) | date = 2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence in African Politics==
A BBC Africa journalist once questioned whether Joshua was “the most powerful man in Africa” due to his alleged influence in the African political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Ihechukwu | last = Njoku | title = Will TB Joshua Become Liberia's Kingmaker? | url = https://www.thecable.ng/will-tb-joshua-become-liberias-kingmaker | work = The Cable (Nigeria)| date = 2017-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ghana===
Days after the late [[John Atta Mills]] became President of Ghana in 2009, his first port of call was Joshua's church for a thanksgiving service where he revealed the cleric had accurately ‘prophesied’ his ascension to power and specific details relating to his narrow victory over [[Nana Akufo-Addo]]. Joshua was a regular visitor to Ghana during Mill's early presidency and allegedly organised prayer warriors to be praying in [[Osu Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Halifax | last = Ansah-Addo | title = Joshua Man Behind Mills | url = https://www.modernghana.com/news/203609/joshua-man-behind-mills.html | work = Modern Ghana | date = 2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malawi===
Joshua's much-publicised prophecy concerning the death of Malawian President [[Bingu Mutharika]] garnered intense media attention and was subsequently the subject of a Malawian government inquiry as his successor, [[Joyce Banda]], is a devotee of the cleric.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Chidi | last = Anselm Odinkalu | title = African tales in presidential ministrations, shamans and charlatans | url = https://www.thecable.ng/african-tales-presidential-ministrations-shamans-charlatans | work = The Cable (Nigeria) | date = 2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Percy | last = Zvomuya | title = TB Joshua: The Preacher Who Knows Too Much | url = https://mg.co.za/article/2012-08-23-tb-joshua-the-preacher-who-knows-too-much | work = Mail &amp; Guardian (South Africa) | date = 2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banda claimed Joshua's prayers healed her husband after he suffered a stroke and regularly visited Joshua in Nigeria while she was Head of State.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Ruth | last = Maclean | title = TB Joshua Predicted Mutharika's Death | url = http://nehandaradio.com/2012/04/11/how-tb-joshua-predicted-mutharikas-death/ | work = Nehanda Radio (Zimbabwe)| date = 2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Joyce Banda On A Private Visit To Nigeria To TB Joshua | url = http://www.nyasatimes.com/joyce-banda-on-a-private-visit-to-nigeria-to-tb-joshua/ | work = Nyasa Times (Malawi)| date = 2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tanzania===
Joshua played the role of a peacemaker in the aftermath of the Tanzanian elections in 2015, visiting the country to meet and hold reconciliatory talks with President [[John Magufuli]] – a member of his church – and opposition leader [[Edward Lowassa]]. Commentators acknowledged his visit significantly reduced tensions in the country after the elections which the opposition party alleged were fraught with irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = REVEALED: TB Joshua's Uncanny Influence In Tanzania | url = http://bulawayo24.com/index-id-news-sc-religion-byo-76922.html | work = Bulawayo 24 (Zimbabwe) | date = 2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberia===
Joshua was a key influence in former Liberian warlord Senator [[Prince Yormie Johnson]]’s decision to endorse the candidacy of [[George Weah]] for president in the 2017 Liberian elections. His endorsement came days after the two were spotted publicly together in The SCOAN, a visit that caused a media storm in Liberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Ex-Liberian Warlord Endorses Weah After Joint Visit To Nigerian Pastor | url = http://www.africanews.com/2017/10/27/ex-liberian-warlord-endorses-weah-after-joint-visit-to-nigerian-pastor/ | work = Africa News | date = 2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Liberian newspapers zoom on Prince Johnson, Weah in Nigeria for prayers, others | url = https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/liberian-newspapers-zoom-on-prince-johnson-weah-in-nigeria-for-prayers-others/ | work = Journal Du Cameroun | date = 2017-10-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171110124433/https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/liberian-newspapers-zoom-on-prince-johnson-weah-in-nigeria-for-prayers-others/ | archivedate = 2017-11-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weah's main opponent and current Vice President, [[Joseph Boakai]], also allegedly requested to visit Joshua in lieu of the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Weah, Boakai Seek Nigerian Prophet T.B.

A Ghanaian psychiatrist in UK was controversially sacked from the [[National Health Service|NHS]] after recommending Emmanuel TV to a patient with a history of 'satanic abuse', although later cleared of any wrongdoing by a tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Alexander | last = Robertson | title = NHS Doctor Who Told Woman Victim Of 'Satanic Abuse' That She Needed An EXORCISM Won't Be Struck Off | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3442562/NHS-doctor-told-woman-victim-satanic-abuse-needed-EXORCISM-won-t-struck-off.html | work = Daily Mail (UK)| date = 2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emmanuel TV's motto is 'Changing lives, changing nations, changing the world.' The station is also known for its catch-phrase, ‘Distance Is Not A Barrier’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Carley| last = Petesch| title = Nigeria Preacher: Healer or Controversial Leader | url = https://www.yahoo.com/news/nigeria-preacher-healer-controversial-leader-145503592.html | agency = Associated Press | date = 2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; encouraging viewers to ‘pray along’ with T.B. Joshua by ‘touching the screen’. There are several claims of people receiving miraculous 'healing' through these prayers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Nosa| last = Osazuwa| title = Watching Emmanuel TV Works Miracles? | url = https://www.modernghana.com/news/360933/watching-emmanuel-tv-works-miracles.html | work = Modern Ghana | date = 2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Henry| last = Allotey| title = Emmanuel TV, A Channel Of Hope | url = http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/religion/Emmanuel-TV-a-channel-of-hope-292456 | work = Ghana Web | date = 2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; including popular [[Nollywood]] actress [[Tonto Dikeh]] who said Joshua's prayers ended her 14-year smoking addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Opeoluwani | last = Ogunjimi | title = TB Joshua's Prayers Ended My 14 Year Smoking Addiction - Tonto Dike | url = http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/08/tb-joshuas-prayers-ended-my14-years-smoking-addiction-tonto-dike/ | work = Vanguard (Nigeria) | date = 2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joshua has earned a reputation for not focusing on the '[[Prosperity Gospel]]' and Emmanuel TV is known as one of the few Christian channels that does not engage in fundraising on air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = T.B.

===Relationship with other pastors===
Joshua has been publicly condemned by several prominent pastors within Nigeria, his most vocal critic being Pastor [[Kris Okotie]] who described him as a 'son of the devil'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Nicola| last = Menzie| title = Nigerian Pastor Who Preaches With Armed Guards Rebuked For Saying Catholics Going To Hell Calling Pope Anti-Christ | url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/nigerian-pastor-who-preaches-with-armed-guards-rebuked-for-saying-catholics-going-to-hell-calling-pope-anti-christ-110871/ | work = Christian Post | date = 2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian Association of Nigeria]] and [[Pentecostal Fellowship Of Nigeria]] have both acknowledged Joshua is not a member of either organisation and denounced him as an 'impostor'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = J.

===Blacklisted in Cameroon===
He was 'blacklisted' by the government of Cameroon in 2010 and termed a 'son of the devil'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Simon| last = Ateba| title = Cameroon Blacklists TB Joshua | url = http://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2010/09/30/cameroon-blacklists-t-b-joshua/ | work = PM News (Nigeria)| date = 2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumours of a visit by Joshua to Zimbabwe in 2012 led to an intense national debate, culminating with pastors and politicians strongly objecting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Zimbabwe Churches Say TB Joshua Not Welcome | url = http://www.zambiawatchdog.com/zimbabwe-churches-say-tb-joshua-not-welcome/ | work = Zambia Watchdog (Zambia)| date = 2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spat with 'witch-doctor'===
A popular Ghanaian 'witch-doctor' said he went to the Vatican City to 'report' Joshua to [[Pope Francis]] for his 'false' prophecies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Kojo Akoto| last = Boateng| title = Pope Must Call TB Joshua To Order - Kwaku Bonsam | url = http://citifmonline.com/2014/04/15/pope-must-call-t-b-joshua-to-order-kwaku-bonsam/ | work = Citi FM (Ghana)| date = 2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV deaths In London===
In 2011, several media houses in UK reported at least three people in [[London]] with HIV died after they stopped taking life saving drugs on the advice of their pastors. The HIV prevention charity African Health Policy Network (AHPN) believed that The SCOAN "may" be one of those involved in such practices although the three in question have no demonstrable link to the SCOAN. The BBC quoted The SCOAN as saying "No, we do not ask people to stop taking their medication".&lt;ref name=HIVcure&gt;{{Cite news| title = Church HIV prayer cure claims 'cause three deaths'| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14406818|publisher=Bbc.co.uk| date = 2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private jet===
On 14 September 2015 it was reported that Joshua "secretly purchased a $60 Million Gulfstream G550 Private Jet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Synagogue Pastor TB Joshua Secretly Purchases $60 Million Gulfstream G550 Private Jet|url = http://saharareporters.com/2015/09/14/synagogue-pastor-tb-joshua-secretly-purchases-60-million-gulfstream-g550-private-jet|website = Sahara Reporters|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rumors were dismissed as false by a media aide of Joshua.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Rumors Of T.B Joshua’s Purchase Of $60m Private Jet Baseless, False – Aide| url = https://www.informationng.com/2015/09/rumors-of-t-b-joshuas-purchase-of-60m-private-jet-baseless-false-aide.html | date = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boko Haram confession===
A self-confessed member of the Islamic sect [[Boko Haram]] came to The SCOAN in March 2014, allegedly with plans to 'bomb' the church. According to him, it was Joshua's prayers that prevented the plan and later compelled him to confess.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Raheem| last = Ibrahim| title = Boko Haram Plans To Bomb TB Joshua's Church Averted | url = http://www.nigerianobservernews.com/13032014/news/news16.html#.VuKOVZwrKUk | work = Nigerian Observer (Nigeria)| date = 2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent clip of the confession went viral on YouTube&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = WATCH VIDEO: T.B Joshua Releases Full Video Clip Of Boko Haram Deliverance | url = http://www.nigerianeye.com/2014/03/watch-video-tb-joshua-releases-full.html | work = Nigerian Eye (Nigeria)| date = 2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proved very controversial.

===Malawi president replies 'death' prophecy===

===Panama Papers===
Nigeria's [[Premium Times]] newspaper stated that Joshua incorporated a company called Chillon Consultancy Limited in the British Virgin Islands in June 2006, based on reports stemming from the [[Panama Papers]] leak. Joshua immediately denied his involvement, stating on Facebook, "I am not a businessman and have no business whatsoever.

===Muslim Cleric Threat===

Having been a member of the Ulu Pandan branch of the Young PAP for 7 years, she was fielded by the PAP as a candidate to attract the "unpredictable" youth vote through social networking sites.&lt;ref name=sentinel&gt;{{cite news|last=Russell|first=Jon|title=Nicole Seah and the social media effect|url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3152&amp;Itemid=181|accessdate=1 May 2011|newspaper=[[Asia Sentinel]]|date=27 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430085208/http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3152&amp;Itemid=181|archive-date=2011-04-30|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On election day, the PAP took Marine Parade GRC with 56.65% of the votes, defeating [[National Solidarity Party (Singapore)|National Solidarity Party]]'s team led by Cheo Chai Chen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/GeneralElection/News/Story/STIStory_666063.html|title=PAP takes Marine Parade|date=8 May 2011|newspaper=The Straits Times (Singapore)|access-date=2011-07-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724043414/http://www.straitstimes.com/GeneralElection/News/Story/STIStory_666063.html|archive-date=2011-07-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goh Chok Tong admitted after the election that Tin's youth and negative image perceived by the public was a "factor" for the People's Action Party's weaker performance this election compared to their 72.9% win in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE: Tin Pei Ling "a factor" for weak results, says SM Goh|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1127545/1/.html|website=Channel News Asia|date=8 May 2011|accessdate=8 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510010922/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1127545/1/.html|archive-date=2011-05-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June 2011, Tin announced on her [[Facebook]] account that she had resigned from her Senior Associate position in [[Ernst &amp; Young]], where she had worked for four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ge.pap.org.sg/candidate/tinpeiling |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114073042/http://ge.pap.org.sg/candidate/tinpeiling |archivedate=2013-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She said the decision was made in order to focus on her responsibilities as full-time MP in her MacPherson ward and the Marine Parade GRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MP Tin Pei Ling resigns from Ernst &amp; Young|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_674920.html|accessdate=1 June 2011|newspaper=[[Straits Times]]|date=1 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603053239/http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_674920.html|archive-date=2011-06-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tin's selection as a candidate for Parliament in 2011 resulted in a large online backlash, especially amongst young Singaporeans.&lt;ref name=sentinel/&gt; Throughout the campaign, Tin garnered negative attention due to her perceived immaturity to become an MP,&lt;ref name="conscience"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/conscience-clear-tin-pei-ling-20110414-001731-974.html |title=My conscience is clear: Tin Pei Ling |accessdate=7 May 2011 |author=Alicia Wong |date=14 April 2011 |website= |publisher=Yahoo Singapore |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yVndaHKj?url=http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/conscience-clear-tin-pei-ling-20110414-001731-974.html |archivedate=7 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and allusions were also raised as to how her husband's position had opened doors for her into politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | access-date=2011-07-06 | archive-date=2011-08-07 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807234605/http://www.straitstimes.com/GeneralElection/News/Story/STIStory_661750.html | url=http://www.straitstimes.com/GeneralElection/News/Story/STIStory_661750.html/ | title=Straight fight in Marine Parade GRC between PAP and NSP | dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A widely circulated Facebook photo of Tin posing with a [[Kate Spade New York|Kate Spade]]-branded gift from her husband, also led to widespread accusations online of [[ignorance]], [[materialism]] and privilege.&lt;ref name="conscience"/&gt;&lt;ref name=spade&gt;{{cite news|title=PAP's youngest candidate faces online criticism|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20110331-271039.html|accessdate=1 May 2011|date=31 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403034459/http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20110331-271039.html|archive-date=2011-04-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked if there was a policy she would change, she replied that there were no policy that she felt strongly against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ting|first=Victoria|title=Tin Pei Ling: New blood or bad blood?|url=http://veryfinecommentary.tk/articles/tin-pei-ling-new-blood-bad-blood/|website=Very Fine Commentary|accessdate=1 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425043148/http://veryfinecommentary.tk/articles/tin-pei-ling-new-blood-bad-blood/|archivedate=25 April 2011|df=}}{{verify credibility|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked what her "greatest regret" was, she said it was not having brought her (still living) parents to [[Universal Studios Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video: Tin Pei Ling's greatest regret|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20110331-271047.html|access-date=2011-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403035423/http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20110331-271047.html|archive-date=2011-04-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Singaporeans were concerned that as an "undeserving [candidate]," Tin had a high chance of being elected "not on [her] own merit, but rather on the back of established MPs" since the 5-member PAP team would be voted in or rejected as a group under Singapore's [[Group Representative Constituency]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Online petition against PAP’s Tin Pei Ling |url=http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/online-petition-against-pap-tin-pei-ling-20110405-092443-518.html;_ylt=Akep0qaf6elwzcYgY9540bz9Vsd_;_ylu=X3oDMTBwcWVpbGxsBHBvcwMxMQRzZWMDTWVkaWFCbG9nSW5kZXg-;_ylg=X3oDMTFjaTBvcG51BGludGwDc2cEbGFuZwNlbi1zZwRwc3RhaWQDBHB0A3NlY3Rpb25zBHRlc3QD;_ylv=3 |work=Yahoo!

The public's online hostility towards Tin was so great that [[Goh Chok Tong]] defended her in the press. He said he had taken Tin in when Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] had offered her to be fielded as a candidate in his GRC. He had accepted her as he did not think Tin was a weak candidate. He dismissed the online criticisms as "distortion" and even though "some sound bites of her which pitted her as a rather light-weight person", it was just "a superficial view". He still believed that she "would work very hard", "[could] reach out to the young, and the not so young," that he "would like her to do more to help the old people in MacPherson," and that she would become "a good MP in due course".&lt;ref name=siow&gt;{{cite news|last=Siow|first=Maria|title=GE: SM Goh defends quality of new PAP candidates|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1123539/1/.html|accessdate=18 April 2011|date=4 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419195620/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1123539/1/.html|archive-date=2011-04-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicole Seah]] from the [[National Solidarity Party (Singapore)|National Solidarity Party]] (NSP) team in [[Marine Parade GRC]] filed a complaint to the [[Elections Department]] on 6 May 2011, stating that Tin had violated the state-mandated cooling-off period 24 hours before polls by posting a Facebook comment on Seah crying during her walkabout. Under the Singapore Parliamentary Elections Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation| cap = 218 | title = Parliamentary Elections Act | ed = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; canvassing on Polling Day and Cooling Off Day is prohibited and the offence carries a fine or imprisonment or both.

'''Václav Holek''' (24 September 1886, Malé Nepodřice&lt;ref name="matrika"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digi.ceskearchivy.cz/cs/6388/257|author=Martin Hankovec|publisher=digi.ceskearchivy.cz|title=DigiArchiv SOA v Třeboni - ver. 16.11.11 &amp;#124; Parish register on birth and christening |accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 13 November 1954, [[Brno]]) was a Czech [[firearm]] engineer. He is considered to be the most eminent [[weapon]]s designer of the pre-war [[Czechoslovakia]]. He had applied for more than 75 patents during his active years.

== Life ==
Václav Holek was born in a village of Malé Nepodřice, southern [[Bohemia]], in 1886. He completed his apprenticeship as a [[gunsmith]] and studied afterwards in the town of [[Písek]]. In 1905 he started working with an Anton Mulacz company in [[Vienna]], from 1910 he had acquired a job with the gunsmith Jan Nowotný in [[Prague]], where he took part in refining of [[Holland &amp; Holland]] system [[shotgun]]s. During [[World War I]] the company produced [[Artillery|artillery guns]] for the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]].

In 1918 Holek switched to the Zbrojovka Praga, a firearm company newly established by the son of Holek’s former boss Jan Nowotný. Here a service [[semi-automatic pistol]] designated for the [[Czechoslovak Army]] and police designed by Holek came into existence. And it was here where, in the spring time of 1921, Václav Holek constructed a [[light machine gun]] from which the Czechoslovak Army light machine gun PRAGA vz. 24 was born, the predecessor of the [[ZB vz. 26]] light machine gun. (Later,  British [[Royal Small Arms Factory]] of [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]] bought the [[license]] and produced some 220,000 of those guns marked as [[Bren light machine gun|Bren]].)

In December 1924 Holek switched to the [[Zbrojovka Brno|Československá zbrojovka in Brno]], where, in the 1930s, he developed the [[ZB-53]] [[machine gun]], of which 60.000 pieces marked as [[Besa machine gun]] were produced in Britain.

During [[World War II]] and in the post-war years Václav Holek developed a number of modern semi-automatic weapons out of which only the [[Vz. 52 machine gun|Vz. 52 light machine gun]] saw the production line.

He was a high-profile critic of his former employers during the [[George W. Bush]] administration, and later criticized the NSA's data collection policies during the Barack Obama administration. In 2016, Binney said the U.S. intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election was false, but on close examination of the documents that purported to prove a British origin of the hacking, could not prove the data was downloaded from the [[Democratic National Committee]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252445769/Briton-ran-pro-Kremlin-disinformation-campaign-that-helped-Trump-deny-Russian-links|title=Briton ran pro-Kremlin disinformation campaign that helped Trump deny Russian links|work=ComputerWeekly.com|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Binney grew up in rural Pennsylvania and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from the [[Pennsylvania State University]] in 1970. He said that he volunteered for the Army during the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam era]] in order to select work that would interest him rather than [[Conscription|be drafted]] and have no input. He was found to have strong aptitudes for [[mathematics]], [[analysis]], and [[Cryptanalysis|code breaking]],&lt;ref name="HOPE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopenumbernine.net/schedule/#binney|title=Keynote Address: William Binney|year=2012|work=Schedule – HOPE Number Nine|publisher=2600 Enterprises|accessdate=May 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served from 1965 to 1969 in the [[United States Army Security Agency|Army Security Agency]] before going to the NSA in 1970.

Binney was a Russia specialist and worked in the operations side of intelligence, starting as an analyst and ending as a [[Technical director|Technical Director]] prior to becoming a geopolitical world Technical Director. In the 1990s, he co-founded a unit on automating signals intelligence with NSA research chief Dr. John Taggart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://civic.mit.edu/blog/schock/the-government-is-profiling-you-william-binney-former-nsa |title=The Government Is Profiling You |work=MIT Center for Internet and Society |date=November 12, 2012 |accessdate=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Binney's NSA career culminated as Technical Leader for intelligence in 2001. He has expertise in [[intelligence analysis]], [[traffic analysis]], [[systems analysis]], [[knowledge management]], and mathematics (including [[set theory]], [[number theory]], and [[probability]]).&lt;ref name="declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publicintelligence.net/binney-nsa-declaration/|title=Sworn Declaration of Whistleblower William Binney on NSA Domestic Surveillance Capabilities|date=July 16, 2012|publisher=Public Intelligence|accessdate=May 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt;

After retiring from the NSA, he founded, together with fellow NSA whistleblower [[J. Kirk Wiebe]], Entity Mapping, LLC, a [[private intelligence agency]] to market their analysis program to government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Government Accountability Project website | title = NSA Whistleblowers William (Bill) Binney and J.

Kirk Wiebe and William Binney "have started a company (Pretty Good Knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = prettygoodknowledge.eu website | title = Massive Data Analysis| url = https://prettygoodknowledge.eu/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with partners in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, to resurrect and do the kinds of smart things we thought we do with data back in the 1990s, because this government and the Deep State as well as the shadow government didn't want us doing that here. So we're over there doing this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = acamedia.info | title = NSA Whistleblower Bill Binney, and His Ordeal| url = http://acamedia.info/politics/surveillance/references/NSA_Whistleblower_Bill_Binney,_and_His_Ordeal.html |accessdate = February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NSA surveillance}}
In September 2002, he, along with [[J. Kirk Wiebe]] and [[Edward Loomis]], asked the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Defense Department]] [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|Inspector General]] (DoD IG) to investigate the NSA for allegedly wasting "millions and millions of dollars" on [[Trailblazer Project|Trailblazer]], a system intended to analyze mass collection of data carried on communications networks such as the Internet. Binney had been one of the inventors of an alternative system, [[ThinThread]], which was shelved when Trailblazer was chosen instead. Binney has also been publicly critical of the NSA for spying on U.S. citizens, saying of its expanded [[NSA electronic surveillance program|surveillance]] after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]] that "it's better than anything that the [[KGB]], the [[Stasi]], or the [[Gestapo]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] ever had"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Shorrock |first= Tim |authorlink= Tim Shorrock |title= The Untold Story: Obama's Crackdown on Whistleblowers: The NSA Four reveal how a toxic mix of cronyism and fraud blinded the agency before 9/11 |journal= The Nation |date= April 15, 2013 |url= http://www.thenation.com/article/173521/obamas-crackdown-whistleblowers }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as noting Trailblazer's ineffectiveness and unjustified high cost compared to the far less intrusive ThinThread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = NSA Whistleblowers William (Bill) Binney and J.

=== After the NSA ===
After he left the NSA in 2001, Binney was one of several people investigated as part of an inquiry into a 2005 ''[[The New York Times]]'' exposé on the agency’s [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|warrantless eavesdropping program]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Binney was cleared of wrongdoing after three interviews with [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents beginning in March 2007, but in early July 2007, in an unannounced, armed, early morning raid, a dozen agents armed with rifles appeared at his house, one of whom entered the bathroom and pointed his gun at Binney, who was taking a shower. The FBI confiscated a desktop computer, disks, and personal and business records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive: National Security Agency Whistleblower William Binney on Growing State Surveillance|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2012/4/20/exclusive_national_security_agency_whistleblower_william|website=Democracy Now!|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}} The NSA revoked his [[security clearance]], forcing him to close a business he ran with former colleagues at a loss of a reported $300,000 in annual income. The FBI raided the homes of Wiebe and Loomis, as well as [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Intelligence Committee]] staffer [[Diane Roark]], the same morning. Several months later the FBI raided the home of then still active NSA executive [[Thomas Andrews Drake]] who had also contacted DoD IG, but anonymously with confidentiality assured. The Assistant Inspector General, [[John Crane (government official)|John Crane]], in charge of the [[Department of Defense Whistleblower Program|Whistleblower Program]], suspecting his superiors provided confidential information to the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ), challenged them, was eventually forced from his position, and subsequently himself became a public whistleblower. The punitive treatment of Binney, Drake, and the other whistleblowers also led [[Edward Snowden]] to go public with his revelations rather than report through the internal whistleblower program.&lt;ref name="Spiegel"&gt;{{cite news |last = Hertsgaard |first = Mark |last2 = Kasten |first2 = Felix |last3 = Rosenbach |first3 = Marcel |last4 = Stark |first4 = Holger |title = Blowing the Whistle: Former US Official Reveals Risks Faced by Internal Critics |newspaper = Der Spiegel |pages = |language = English |date = 22 May 2016 |url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/ex-us-official-reveals-risks-faced-by-internal-govt-critics-a-1093360.html |access-date = 2016-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Binney and his co-plaintiffs went to federal court to retrieve the confiscated items.&lt;ref name="inquiry"&gt;{{cite news |last = Bronner |first = Ethan |author2=Charlie Savage |author3=Scott Shane |title = Leak Inquiries Show How Wide A Net U.S. Cast |newspaper = The New York Times |date = May 25, 2013 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/us/leaks-inquiries-show-how-wide-a-net-is-cast.html?_r=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allegations on intercepts ===
Binney is known for making the claim that the NSA collects and stores information about every U.S. communication.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/nsa-critic-bill-binney-says-trump-pushed-meeting-cia-s-n818306|title=Was Donald Trump behind meeting of CIA chief and conspiracy theorist?|work=NBC News|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Binney was invited as a witness by the [[German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal|NSA commission]] of the German [[Bundestag]]. On July 3, 2014 ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' wrote, he said that the NSA wanted to have information about everything. In Binney's view this is a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] approach, which had previously been seen only in dictatorships.&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite news|title=Untersuchungsausschuss im Bundestag: US-Informant vergleicht NSA mit einer Diktatur |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/william-binney-als-zeuge-im-nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-a-979062.html|accessdate=4 July 2014|work=Spiegel|publisher=Spiegelonline GmbH|date=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Binney stated that the goal was to control people. Meanwhile, he said that it is possible in principle to monitor the whole population, abroad and in the U.S., which in his view contradicts the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="spiegel" /&gt;

In August 2014 Binney was among the signatories of an open letter by the group [[Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity]] to German chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] in which they urged the Chancellor to be suspicious of U.S. intelligence regarding the alleged invasion of Russia in Eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref name=Spiegel2014-09-04/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheNation2014-09-02/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/ukraine-und-russland-us-geheimdienst-pensionaere-warnen-merkel-vor-fehlinformationen/10655758.html "US-Geheimdienst-Pensionäre warnen Merkel vor Fehlinformationen", Der Tagesspiegel (in German), September 4, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; In the open letter, the group said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[A]ccusations of a major Russian "invasion" of Ukraine appear not to be supported by reliable intelligence. Rather, the "intelligence" seems to be of the same dubious, politically "fixed" kind used 12 years ago to "justify" the U.S.-led attack on Iraq.&lt;ref name=TheNation2014-09-02/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Russian Interference in the 2016 election ===
{{see|Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections}}
Binney claims the U.S. intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election is false, and that the [[Democratic National Committee]] e-mails were leaked by an insider instead.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2017/11/07/dnc-hack-trump-cia-director-william-binney-nsa/|title=CIA Director Met Advocate of Disputed DNC Hack Theory — at Trump’s Request|last=Campbell|first=Duncan|last2=Risen|first2=James|date=2017-11-07|website=The Intercept|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sean-hannity-wikileaks-conspiracy-theory-cia-hacked-2017-3?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Conservative media figures are embracing a wild WikiLeaks conspiracy theory that the CIA hacked the DNC, and then framed Russia|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-10/why-some-u-s-ex-spies-don-t-buy-the-russia-story|title=Why Some U.S. Ex-Spies Don't Buy the Russia Story|date=2017-08-10|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has appeared on Fox News at least ten times between September 2016 and November 2017 to promote this theory.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Binney said that the "intelligence community wasn’t being honest here".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He has also been frequently cited on Breitbart News.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In November 2017 it was reported that a month earlier, Binney had met with CIA Director Mike Pompeo at the behest of President Trump.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Role in apparent release of the Nunes Memo===

On January 23, 2018, Binney made an appearance on the [[Infowars]] news program&lt;ref&gt;https://www.infowars.com/exclusive-infowars-releases-secret-fisa-memo/&lt;/ref&gt; in connection with the [[Nunes memo]], a Congressional document alleging irregularities in the application of the [[FISA|FISA Act]], which at that time was not publicly available although its potential release was a topic of public debate.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/04/trump-twitter-russians-release-the-memo-216935&lt;/ref&gt; During the show, host [[Alex Jones]] announced that Binney had been able to provide him with the actual memo, and the purported leaked document was shown on air.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/02/politics/fbi-nunes-memo-full/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was in fact a public document that had been available on the website of the [[Director of National Intelligence|Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] since at least May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weeklystandard.com/fact-check-did-infowars-release-the-secret-fisa-memo/article/2011273&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/release-the-memo-nunes-fisa-702/&lt;/ref&gt; The actual Nunes memo was released February 2, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/02/nunes-memo-trump-clears-path-for-release-of-controversial-document&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documentary film ==
Binney's story is recounted in ''[[A Good American]]'', a documentary film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/movies/a-good-american-review.html|title=Review: In 'A Good American,' Examining Sept. 11 and Data Collection|last=Kenigsberg|first=Ben|date=2 February 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
