[[File:Marc, Franz - Pferde in Landschaft.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Franz Marc]]'s ''Pferde in Landschaft'', one of the artworks discovered in the Gurlitt collection (probably 1911, [[gouache]] on coloured paper).]]

In February 2012, the [[Prosecutor|District Prosecutor]] of Augsburg confiscated 121 framed and 1,285 unframed artworks found in an apartment in [[Schwabing]], [[Munich]] in the course of an investigation into possible tax evasion.&lt;ref name=BBC24818541/&gt; The apartment was rented to  Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of celebrated art historian, dealer, and war profiteer, [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], and grandson of the art historian [[Cornelius Gurlitt (art historian)|Cornelius Gurlitt]].  Some of the paintings were immediately suspected of having been [[Nazi plunder|looted]] by the [[Nazi]]s during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The collection is largely undamaged and of remarkable quality. It contains [[Old Masters]] as well as [[Impressionist]], [[Cubist]], and [[Expressionist]] paintings by artists including [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Otto Dix]], and [[Max Liebermann]], among many others. Although German authorities seized the entire collection, Gurlitt was not detained. Not until 3 November 2013 did the magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' report the find.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; News of the discovery was reported worldwide.&lt;ref name="Smale"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/arts/design/trove-of-apparently-nazi-looted-art-found-in-munich-apartment.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0 |title= Report of Nazi-Looted Trove Puts Art World in an Uproar |last=Smale |first=Alison |date=4 November 2013 |website= |publisher=''The New York Times'' |access-date= 18 March 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gurlitt initially refused to cooperate with investigators. He retained several dozen additional suspect paintings, kept not in Munich but in his home in Salzburg, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26133532 |title=Nazi loot probe: More art found at Gurlitt Austria home, BBC News, 11 February 2014 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2014-02-11 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2014, an agreement was reached whereby the collection confiscated in Munich was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with a government-led task force charged with returning stolen pieces to the rightful owners.&lt;ref name="DWdr 20140407"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dw.de/p/1BdMb |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=7 April 2014 |accessdate=16 April 2014 |last=R |first=D |title=Gurlitt reaches deal with German authorities over vast trove of art}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014.&lt;ref name="Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10811916/Cornelius-Gurlitt-obituary.html |title=Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary |publisher=Telegraph |date=6 May 2014 |accessdate= 28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His will bequeathed all his property to the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]], Switzerland, after all legitimate claims of ownership against it had been evaluated.&lt;ref name="BBC 7 May 2014"&gt;{{cite news|title='Nazi art' hoarder Gurlitt makes Swiss museum sole heir|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27306269|accessdate=7 May 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.artnet.com/in-brief/will-germany-keep-gurlitts-trove-from-the-swiss-14647#.U2ujUaPvmMk.facebook |title=Artnet news, Alexander Forbes, '&amp;#39;Will Germany Keep Gurlitt’s Trove from the Swiss?'&amp;#39; |publisher=News.artnet.com |date=2014-05-08 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In 1930 art collector Hildebrand Gurlitt was removed as director of the museum in [[Zwickau]] because he exhibited contemporary artists. After the Nazis came to power, he was stripped of his new job as director of [[Kunstverein Hamburg]], because his grandmother was a Jew.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lichtblau |first=Eric |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/nazi_policies_toward_jews_and_minorities/ |title='&amp;#39;Nazi Policies Toward Jews and Minorities'&amp;#39;, NY Times, 18 November 2013 |publisher=Topics.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He moved the family to [[Dresden]] and built a prosperous business as an art dealer, specializing in modern art.&lt;ref name="Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary"/&gt;

Hildebrand was appointed as a dealer for the [[Führermuseum]] in [[Linz]], Austria.{{Clarify|date=March 2016|reason= vague. Appointed when?  by whom?}}  On instructions from [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]] [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Hermann Göring]] personally appointed a Commission for the Exploitation of Degenerate Art.{{Clarify|date=March 2016|reason= vague. Created when?}}  The Commission in turn appointed a series of dealers approved by the official Nazi confiscation service, the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|ERR]], to handle the marketing of these art assets. Four men who had been dealing in modern art for years were chosen: Karl Buchholz, Ferdinand Möller, Bernhard A. Böhmer and Hildebrand Gurlitt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title= The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War| publisher=Random House LLC | author=Nicholas, Lynn H. |date = 1995 |accessdate=22 December 2009 | page=24 | isbn=9780307739728}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were instructed to sell these artworks abroad for foreign currency.  Hildebrand's extensive network of European and North American art contacts were invaluable in this.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Göring used the funds raised to grow his personal art collection, though the four men did not always report to the Commission all proceeds of their sales.&lt;ref name=BJParis&gt;{{cite web|last=Feliciano |first=Hector |url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/the-lost-museum/ |title=The Lost Museum |publisher=Bonjour Paris |accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works of so-called "degenerate art" that the Commission sold off were many paintings stolen from noted French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]].

[[File:Sworn Statement Dr. H. Gurlitt 1945.pdf|thumb|1945 statement by [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]] to Allied authorities, describing his dealings before and during the war and listing art in his possession]]

In May 1940 the Reich Propaganda Ministry sold to Gurlitt 200 paintings, including Chagall's ''The Walk'', Picasso's ''Farming Family'', and Nolde's ''Hamburg Harbour,'' for the small sum of 4,000 Swiss francs.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168/&gt;  Hildebrand similarly acquired 115 additional works of "degenerate art" in 1941.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168/&gt; It is estimated that, at his height, he had a personal trading collection of more than 1500 art objects.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholas"/&gt;

Gurlitt used his position to sell art to domestic collectors, most notably to [[Bernhard Sprengel]], whose collection forms the core of the [[Sprengel Museum]] in Hannover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://derstandard.at/1216918696497/Entartete--Kunstgeschaefte | title=Entartete Kunstgeschäfte | work=Der Standard | date=6 August 2008 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captured with his wife and twenty boxes of art in Aschbach ([[Schlüsselfeld]]) in June 1945, Gurlitt claimed that the art was part of his personal collection, and that most of his collection and all of his records had been destroyed during the [[bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] in February 1945.&lt;ref name="Suddeutsche"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/depot-mit-nazi-raubkunst-in-muenchen-der-verwerter-und-sein-sohn-1.1809631 | title=Depot mit Nazi-Raubkunst in München | work=Süddeutsche.de | date=3 November 2013 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | author=Mazzoni, Ira |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; He painted himself as a victim of Nazi persecution due to his Jewish heritage, and on those grounds he was released.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;
 
[[File:Liebermann, Max - Zwei Reiter am Strand - Gurlitt.jpg|thumb|[[Max Liebermann]]'s ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' in the Gurlitt collection and subject to a claim by the descendants of the original Jewish owner]]

Although suspicious of his story, in December 1950 US investigators returned 206 items to Gurlitt, including [[Max Liebermann]]'s ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'', [[Otto Dix]]'s self-portrait, an allegorical painting by [[Marc Chagall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2493980/Nazi-art-loot-German-dealer-quizzed-U-S-military-just-war.html#ixzz2k9BmfvdM|title=How U.S. military quizzed German dealer of £1bn Nazi art loot just after the war|last=Enoch |first=Nick|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=9 November 2013|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gurlitt continued trading artworks until his death in 1956.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholas"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War | publisher=Random House LLC | author=Nicholas, Lynn H. | date=22 December 2009 | page=24 | isbn=9780307739728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornelius Gurlitt (28 December 1932 – 6 May 2014) was a German [[Private collection|art collector]], son  of [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]]. He grew up in the [[Dammtor]] district of Hamburg with his sister Renate, who was born there in 1935. His great-grandmother was Jewish, which caused his father to be labelled as a "quarter-Jew" under the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nazi race laws]] in the ''Volkszählung vom 17. Mai 1939'', or so-called "German Minority Census" of 1939.&lt;ref&gt;This "German Minority Census" is available in digital form at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Resource Center in Washington D.C. and at the German Federal Archives in Berlin-Lichterfelde. An unsourced copy of the database was published online by the [http://www.heartwebsite.org/ArchivalResearch.aspx Holocaust Era Assets and Restitution Taskforce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109175142/http://www.heartwebsite.org/ArchivalResearch.aspx |date=2013-11-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery by German customs authorities==
In 2010 German customs officers detained Cornelius Gurlitt entering Germany from Switzerland carrying €9,000 (£7,500; $13,000) in cash,&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; which he explained as the proceeds of a transaction with the Galerie Kornfeld in Bern. Gurlitt was allowed to go on his way, but he had aroused suspicions. Further investigation by the prosecutor's office, the federal police and the tax authorities uncovered a number of anomalies.&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Investigators discovered that Gurlitt had never been employed, had no obvious source of income, was not registered with the {{ill|Einwohnermeldeamt|de}} or with the tax authorities or social services, had never married, and had no pension or health insurance.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In late February 2012, the authorities searched his apartment, finding more than a thousand paintings valued at as much as €1 billion.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/kultur/kunst/1500-werke-von-picasso-bis-chagall-zollfahnder-entdecken-sensationellen-kunstschatz-in-muenchen_aid_1147066.html|title=Fahnder entdecken 1500 Werke von Picasso, Chagall und weiteren Künstlern|work=Focus|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC24794970&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24794970|title=Nazi looted art 'found in Munich'|publisher=BBC News|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FAZ_Nov22&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/schwabinger-kunstfund-ein-dementi-weitere-meldungen-nuechterne-schaetzungen-12674903.html|title=Schwabinger Kunstfund: Ein Dementi, weitere Meldungen, nüchterne Schätzungen|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=22 November 2013|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' stated that at least 200 pieces were believed to have been lost during the Nazi era.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;
The paintings recovered included works by &lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; [[Ernst Barlach]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Canaletto]], Marc Chagall, {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Christoph|de}}, [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], Otto Dix, [[Albrecht Dürer]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Erich Fraaß|de}}, [[Conrad Felixmüller]], [[Bonaventura Genelli]], [[Ludwig Godenschweg]], [[Otto Griebel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Paul Klee]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Bernhard Kretzschmar|de}}, [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Wilhelm Lachnit]], [[Max Liebermann]], [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Fritz Maskos|de}}, [[Henri Matisse]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Théodore Rousseau]], [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]], [[Carl Spitzweg]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Christoph Voll]].

==Initial legal handling of the Gurlitt case==
On 5 November 2013, Reinhard Nemetz, the head of the prosecutors' office in [[Augsburg]], said that 121 framed and 1,258 unframed works had been seized from the apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt in early March 2012,&lt;ref name=BBC24818541/&gt; including unregistered works by Chagall, Dix, Liebermann, and Matisse.&lt;ref name=BBC24818541&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24818541|title=Nazi trove in Munich contains unknown works by masters|publisher=BBC News|date=5 November 2013|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian who first examined the collection, [[Meike Hoffmann]], claimed in print in 2010 that "not a single one" of these works was ever acquired by Hildebrand Gurlitt. Dr. Meike Hoffmann wishes to remark that this controversy derives from a misreading of her book on Bernhard A. Böhmer. In her book, the art historical term ‘Bildwerke’ is used. The term refers only to sculptures, which indeed Hildebrand Gurlitt did not take from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation. Of course, Meike Hoffmann has never questioned the fact that Hildebrandt Gurlitt dealt with other kinds of artworks from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman's book (in German) ''Ein Händler "entarteter" Kunst: Bernhard A. Böhmer und sein Nachlass.'' Akademie-Verlag, Berlin 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-05-004498-9}}. (''Schriften der Forschungsstelle "Entartete Kunst"''),  p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; She stated to ''Focus'' that as many as 300 pieces had appeared in the 1937 Nazi [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]] in Munich.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC24794970/&gt; At the time of the interview with ''Focus'', she was trying to trace the original owners of the works and their surviving relatives.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Art historians asked that a complete list of the paintings be published in order that they be returned to their rightful owners.&lt;ref name=Telg10424957&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10424957/Art-experts-demand-Germany-releases-list-of-1-billion-Nazi-art-trove.html | title=Art experts demand Germany releases list of €1-billion Nazi art trove | work=The Telegraph | date=4 November 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2013 | author=Alexander, Harriet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine in November 2013, Cornelius insisted that his father had obtained the works legally and stated that he would not voluntarily return any of them to previous owners.&lt;ref name=BBCSpiegel&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24977814|title=Nazi-looted art: German collector says he owns pictures |date=17 November 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel interview"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/spiegel-interview-with-cornelius-gurlitt-about-munich-art-find-a-933953.htm | title=Interview with a Phantom: Cornelius Gurlitt Shares the Secrets of His Pictures | work=Der Spiegel | date=17 November 2013 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Gezer, Õzlem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling threatened by the intense media attention, Gurlitt's brother-in-law offered 22 works in his possession to the police for safekeeping.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10439168/Art-dealer-paid-Nazis-just-4000-Swiss-Francs-for-masterpieces.html|title=Art dealer paid Nazis just 4,000 Swiss Francs for masterpieces|last=Barnett |first=Louise|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 November 2013|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCStuttgart&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24910093|title=German police check new art haul near Stuttgart |date=12 November 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' revealed that they had received a letter from Gurlitt telling them that "the name Gurlitt may not appear in your magazine." Gurlitt then told two reporters from the ''[[Paris Match]]'', who confronted him in a Munich supermarket, that "Applause from the wrong side is the worst thing there is." ''Der Spiegel'' found this comment "puzzling."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/cornelius-gurlitt-reporter-spueren-den-kunstsammler-in-muenchen-auf-a-932755.html ''Der Spiegel''], 11 November 2013 (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Portrait of a woman'' by [[Henri Matisse]] was directly traceable to the collection of [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], a Jewish art dealer from Paris who had represented [[Matisse]] and [[Picasso]] and who had been forced to leave his collection behind when he fled France.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Oltermann|first=Philip|title=German police recover 1,500 modernist masterpieces 'looted by Nazis'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/nazis-looted-modernist-masterpieces-germany-police|accessdate=3 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When approached by ''Focus'', Rosenberg's granddaughter, French television presenter [[Anne Sinclair]], who had been fighting for decades for the return of the art dealer's paintings, stated that she knew nothing of the existence of the painting.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2486251/Discovered-Billion-pound-art-collection-seized-Nazis-ordered-destroyed-discovered-rotting-food-dishevelled-Munich-apartment.html#ixzz2jbOnohDE|title=£1billion art collection seized by Nazis found in shabby Munich apartment|author=Hall, Alan|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery efforts for ''Portrait of a woman'' were immediately undertaken on behalf of the Rosenberg heirs by [[Art Recovery Group|Christopher A.

It is believed the work was sold to a collector in Florida in 2002.

One of the last pieces that Cornelius Gurlitt sold was ''The Lion Tamer'' by Max Beckmann. After a settlement, initiated by the Lempertz auction house in Cologne, was reached between Gurlitt and the heirs of [[Alfred Flechtheim]], it was auctioned off for nearly £750,000.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Another work was reportedly sold in 1990 through the [[Bern]]-based gallery of [[Eberhard Kornfeld]].&lt;ref name="Suddeutsche"/&gt;

In March 2014, a BBC reporter was granted access to one of the locations where 238 of the seized works were stored. He viewed works such as [[Monet]]'s ''[[Waterloo Bridge (painting)|Waterloo Bridge]]'' (1903) and others by [[Picasso]], [[Cezanne]], [[Liebermann]], [[Renoir]], [[Courbet]], and [[Manet]].&lt;ref name="BBC 20140326"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26746697 |title=Cornelius Gurlitt: One lonely man and his hoard of stolen Nazi art |last=Evans |first=Stephen |publisher=[[BBC News Magazine]] |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2014, a month before Gurlitt's death, an agreement was reached whereby the seized artwork was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with the government-led task force charged with determining which of the pieces was stolen and returning them to the rightful heirs.&lt;ref name="DWdr 20140407"/&gt;

===Schwabinger (Gurlitt) Art Trove Task Force===
An entity called the Schwabinger Kunstfund or Gurlitt Task Force was created to research the provenance of the paintings in the Gurlitt trove. However, after several years of operations under the direction of Ingeborg Berggreen-Merkel it was widely criticized for having few results and little visibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/task-force-investigating-art-trove-inherited-from-nazi-collector-achieved-embarrassing-results/a-18876659&lt;/ref&gt;

Berggreen-Merkel was accused of visiting the severely ill Gurlitt at his hospital bed and persuading him to sign over the ownership of his collection, allegedly as the only way to prevent Gurlitt from getting sued from various interest groups, Jewish or other. In early 2014 Gurlitt designated the Kunstmuseum as his sole heir. A few weeks earlier, Berggreen-Merkel had met with the President of the Museum's Foundation Council, Christoph Schäublin. One year later, her taskforce was dissolved. "We are disappointed," said Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taskforce-kunstfund.de/en/chronology.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/gurlitt-und-die-folgen-des-schwabinger-kunstfunds-kunstmuseum-bern-tritt-gurlitt-erbe-an/11021442.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/kultur/Laesst-sich-Bern-die-grosse-GurlittAusstellung-wegschnappen-/story/31357598&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Gurlitt, and after==
Cornelius Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Nazi art' hoarder Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, dies|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27298832|work=BBC|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his will, written on his deathbed, Gurlitt named the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]] in Switzerland as his sole heir.&lt;ref name="BBC 7 May 2014" /&gt;  People close to Gurlitt told an American newspaper that he decided to give the collection to a foreign institution because he felt that Germany had treated him and his father badly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/swiss-museum-close-to-accepting-nazi-era-art-bequest-1416443643 |title= Swiss Museum Close to Accepting Trove of Nazi Art|last1= Lane|first1= Mary M.|date= November 20, 2014|publisher= ''The Wall Street Journal'' |access-date= 13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy included the paintings Gurlitt had kept in Salzburg, paintings which German authorities had not confiscated because their remit did not extend to property held in Austria. Gurlitt's decision created further controversy over the appropriateness of the museum accepting this bequest. The will stipulated that the museum would be required to research the provenance of the paintings and make restitution as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. A12.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum decided to accept those works which are not legally the property of previous Nazi-era owners, or their heirs, and has entered into a joint-agreement with German and Swiss authorities about the handling of this bequest.

Gurlitt's family (cousins) also entered the discussion, raising questions about the legality of the will, based on his state of mind at the time. Gurlitt's cousin, Uta Werner, filed a claim of inheritance on the artwork. Werner's lawyer, Wolfgang Seybold, argued that Gurlitt's relatives were the rightful heirs. Seybold supported his argument with the opinion of psychiatrist and lawyer Helmut Hausner, who stated that Gurlitt suffered from [[schizoid personality disorder]], delusions, and dementia when he wrote the will bequeathing his collection to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die 'Causa Gurlitt': Leichtgradig Kompliziert|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/die-causa-gurlitt-leichtgradig-kompliziert-13273066.html|work=Franffurter Algemeine|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that a number of artworks will be returned to Gurlitt's estate, as he would have been considered the rightful owner unless the heirs of previous owners could prove that he obtained them through unlawful means.&lt;ref name="Welt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/kunst-und-architektur/article121499967/Wie-Picassos-in-einer-vermuellten-Wohnung-landeten.html | title=Wie Picassos in einer vermüllten Wohnung landeten | work=Die Welt | date=3 November 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2013 | author=Dittmar, Peter | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; German authorities estimate that around 590 pieces need further investigation to determine whether they were confiscated under the Nazi regime, and a further 380 have been definitively identified as confiscated by the Nazis as "degenerate art".&lt;ref name="Schwabing art trove"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.lostart.de/Content/02_Aktuelles/2013/13-11-15%20PM%20Taskforce_EN.html?nn=9848 | title=Schwabing art trove: Provenance of treasures to be researched alongside criminal proceedings – suspicious works being publicised at lostart.de | publisher=the Bavarian State Ministry of Justice, the Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science and the Arts, the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media | date=11 November 2013 | accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art objects continued to surface after Gurlitt's death. In July 2014, a new discovery was made in his Munich apartment: two sculptures, possibly the work of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and [[Edgar Degas|Degas]].&lt;ref name=sculptures&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28464629 |title=Possible Rodin and Degas works found at Gurlitt home |publisher=BBC |date=24 July 2014 |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, a landscape by Claude Monet was discovered in a suitcase Gurlitt had left in a hospital where he stayed.&lt;ref name=suitcase&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29085509 |title=Cornelius Gurlitt: Monet found in art hoarder's suitcase |publisher=BBC |date=5 September 2014 |accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
German newspapers questioned the prosecutor's right to seize the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Voss |first=Julia |date=17 November 2013 |title=Münchner Kunstfund: Wo bleibt der Rechtsstaat? |newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunstmarkt/muenchner-kunstfund-wo-bleibt-der-rechtsstaat-12668607.html |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/schwabinger-kunstfund-politische-strafjustiz-12678004.html ''Politische Strafjustiz''] (in German) in the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 25 November 2013, by Volker Rieble.&lt;/ref&gt; Property rights in cases of works of art acquired during the Nazi period are highly complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dittmar |first=Peter |date=7 November 2013 |title=Verbrechen lohnt sich |newspaper=Jüdische Allgemeine |url=http://www.juedische-allgemeine.de/article/view/id/17492 |language=de}}. This article refers in particular to works of ''[[degenerate art]]'', whose confiscation had been formalized by a Nazi law. ''Gesetz über Einziehung von Erzeugnissen entarteter Kunst'' (Act on the Confiscation of Works of Degenerate Art) of 31 May 1938&lt;/ref&gt; After the war the Nazi law legalizing possession of stolen works of ''[[degenerate art]]'' was deliberately upheld by the [[Allied Control Council]] in order that the trade in artworks could continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/khi/forschung/entartete_kunst/dossier/Broschuere_Heuer.pdf?1347697442 Heuer, Carl-Heinz (undated). "Die eigentumsrechtliche Problematik der ''entarteten'' Kunst" – "The problems surrounding ownership rights to ''degenerate'' art"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235653/http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/khi/forschung/entartete_kunst/dossier/Broschuere_Heuer.pdf?1347697442 |date=2 December 2013 }} (bilingual), on the website of the [[Free University of Berlin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in Austria,&lt;ref&gt;''Kunstrückgabegesetz 1998'' (''Art Return Law 1998'') See the [[:de:Restitution (Österreich)#Kunstrückgabegesetz 1998|German Wikipedia entry]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no law in effect in Germany requiring the return of Nazi-looted art, as long as the items in question can be proven to have been, at any point in time, legally acquired. As signatories of the [[Wiedergutmachung|1998 Washington Agreement]], Germany agreed that all of its public institutions would check their inventories for Nazi-looted goods and return them if found. However, this is on a strictly voluntary basis and, 15 years later, very few museums and libraries&lt;ref&gt;The [http://raubgut.zlb.de/index.php/About/Index_en Central and Regional Library of Berlin] is the only library in Germany to have full-time staff devoted to the search for Nazi-looted cultural goods.&lt;/ref&gt; have done so. Individuals are under no legal requirement whatsoever to return Nazi-looted art. A failure on the part of the German government to return the rightful possessions of Cornelius Gurlitt might have been a violation of his property rights as guaranteed in the German constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2013/48/gurlitt-kunstwerke-raubkunst/seite-1 ''Fluch des Schatzes''] (''Curse of the Treasure'') in ''Der Zeit'', 21 November 2013 (in German). ''“German museums are accordingly, albeit rather hesitantly, searching for looted art in their collections, and from time to time works are returned. This is cumbersome, mostly unspectacular and takes far too long, but it is still the right way. But Cornelius Gurlitt is a private person, and therefore the principles of the Washington Agreement do not apply to his artworks. He cannot be forced, and it appears the government wants to seize the works, which is hardly possible in the face of the constitution.”''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2013, prominent German art historian [[Sibylle Ehringhaus]], who was one of the first experts to view the artworks in the spring of 2012, gave an interview in the newspaper ''[[Augsburger Allgemeine]]'', demanding the immediate return of the complete collection to Gurlitt. However, she had looked at the works very briefly and had not researched their [[provenance]] because, as she stated in the interview, "Cornelius Gurlitt commissioned neither myself nor anyone else" to perform such research. Chief Prosecutor Reinhard Nemetz vehemently denied her appeal, yet apparently failed to cite any concrete legal grounds for the seizure.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Interview-Kunstexpertin-fordert-Rueckgabe-aller-Bilder-an-Gurlitt-id27983722.html Interview: Kunstexpertin fordert Rückgabe aller Bilder an Gurlitt], ''Augsburger Allgemeine'', 4 December 2012 (in German) or a [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4590360/Ehringhaus_Gurlitt.pdf translation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001010/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4590360/Ehringhaus_Gurlitt.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }} of the article in English.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Augsburger-Staatsanwaltschaft-weist-Vorwuerfe-der-Kunstexpertin-zurueck-id27992202.html Augsburger Staatsanwaltschaft weist Vorwürfe der Kunstexpertin zurück] ''Augsburger Allgemeine'', 5 December 2012 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2014, the German jurist [[Jutta Limbach]], the head of the Limbach Commission on Nazi-looted art, confirmed the opinion of the German ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' newspaper that the Bavarian "State Prosecutor used an incorrect application of the tax liability law to seize" the artworks of Cornelius Gurlitt.&lt;ref&gt;''Süddeutsche Zeitung'', ''Ein Bild lässt sich abhangen, Schuld nicht'' (in German; English: "A picture may be taken down, but not the guilt"), interview by Heribert Prantl and Kia Vahland, 20 November 2014, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the artworks have been returned to the heirs of the legitimate owners, notably a portrait by Matisse restored to the heirs of French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]]. Another major painting from the collection, ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' (1901), by [[Max Liebermann]], was returned to the heirs of the German-Jewish industrialist and art collector David Friedmann,&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, Melissa (May&amp;nbsp;15, 2015).

==Swiss museum's acceptance of Gurlitt's estate==
On 24 November 2014, the Museum of Fine Arts in [[Bern]] agreed to accept the Gurlitt estate.  Museum officials stated that no art looted by the Nazis would be permitted to enter the museum's collection.&lt;ref name =Notorious&gt;{{cite web| url = https://news.artnet.com/art-world/gurlitt-collection-arrives-kunstmuseum-bern-1018277| title = The Notorious Gurlitt Trove of Nazi-Tainted Art Makes Its First Appearance at Kunstmuseum Bern| author = Neuendorf, Henri| date = July 10, 2017| accessdate = February 12, 2018| publisher = artmet.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 500 works were to remain in Germany until their rightful owners could be identified. Three pieces were singled out for immediate return: [[Henri Matisse]]'s ''Femme Assise'' to the descendants of the Jewish art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], Max Liebermann's ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' to the great-nephew of the industrialist and art collector [[David Friedmann]], and [[Carl Spitzweg]]'s ''Playing the Piano'' to the heirs of music publisher [[Henri Hinrichsen]], who was murdered at Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30176190 |title=Swiss museum to accept Gurlitt 'Nazi art' |publisher=BBC News |date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public display of the Gurlitt art trove took place at an exhibition curated by the Bern Fine Art Museum, running from November 2017 to March 2018, which featured 160 works from the controversial Gurlitt art collection.&lt;ref name =Notorious/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/culture/bern-fine-arts-museum_gurlitt-exhibition-attracts-droves-of-visitors/43793524| title = Gurlitt exhibition attracts droves of visitors| date = January 2, 2018| accessdate = February 12, 2018| publisher = Swissinfo.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AGILE''' ('''A'''stro‐Rivelatore '''G'''amma a '''I'''mmagini '''Le'''ggero) is an [[X-ray]] and [[Gamma ray]] astronomical satellite of the [[Italian Space Agency]] (ASI).

==Objectives==
AGILE's mission is to observe [[gamma-ray]] sources in the universe. Key scientific objectives of the AGILE Mission include the study of:&lt;ref name=asi_agile&gt;[http://www.asi.it/en/activity/high_energy/agile ASI AGILE]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Active galactic nucleus|Active Galactic Nuclei]]
* [[Gamma ray bursts|Gamma-Ray Bursts]]
* X-ray and gamma galactic sources
* Non-identified gamma sources
* Diffuse galactic gamma emissions
* Diffuse extra-galactic gamma emissions
* Fundamental physics

==Instrumentation==
AGILE's instrumentation includes a Gamma Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) sensitive in the 30&amp;nbsp;MeV - 50&amp;nbsp;GeV energy range, a SuperAGILE (SA) hard X-ray monitor sensitive in the 18–60&amp;nbsp;keV energy range, a Mini-Calorimeter (MCAL) non-imaging gamma-ray scintillation detector sensitive in the 350&amp;nbsp;keV - 100&amp;nbsp;MeV energy range,&lt;ref name=Agile_Scientific_Goals_and_Instrument_Performance&gt;[http://people.roma2.infn.it/~agile/Agile_SpacePart03.pdf Scientific Goals and Instrument Performance of the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector AGILE]&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[electronic anticoincidence|Anti-coincidence]] System (AC), based on a plastic [[scintillator]], to assist with suppressing unwanted background events.

The SuperAGILE SA is an instrument based on a set of four silicon strip detectors, each equipped with one-dimensional coded mask. The SA is designed to detect [[X-Ray]] signals from known sources and burst-like signals. It provides long-term monitoring of flux and spectral features. MCAL can also effectively detect high-energy radiation bursts in its energy band.

==Launch and operations==
AGILE was successfully launched on 23 April 2007, from the Indian base of Sriharikota and was inserted in an equatorial orbit with low particle background. On 23 April 2007, ASI made contact with AGILE; its signals were acquired by the ground station at the [[Broglio Space Centre]] near [[Malindi, Kenya]] and it was placed in a Sun-pointing mode.&lt;ref&gt;

==Results==
Some transient events detected by AGILE are associated with positions not consistent with a known source (Gamma Ray Burst) and have cosmological origins. Others are due to [[solar flares]], while some are due to Earth atmosphere events (Terrestrial Gamma Flash).

}}
The '''American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists''' ('''AAEES''') is a society of professional [[Engineering|engineers]] and scientists who have demonstrated special expertise in [[environmental engineering]] or [[Environmental science|science]] beyond that normally required for professional practice, in a process similar to what is required for medical and other professional specialty certifications.

In addition to education and experience, Board-Certified Environmental Engineers and Scientists must have passed written and oral examinations and reviews by an admission panel of the Academy. The Academy's certification program is accredited by the Council of Engineering and Scientific Specialty Boards.&lt;ref name="Brochure"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaee.net/DownloadCenter/BecomeBoardCertified-AAEES.pdf |title=Be Recognized  Among the Best Environmental Engineers and Scientists In the World |publisher=American Academy of Engineers and Scientists |accessdate=2012-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217162800/http://www.aaee.net/DownloadCenter/BecomeBoardCertified-AAEES.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy was founded in 1955 for the principal purpose of serving the public by improving the practice, elevating the standards, and advancing public recognition of environmental engineering through a program of specialty certification of qualified engineers.

The Academy began in 1952, when a group of [[sanitary engineering|sanitary engineers]] working in the [[public health]] and [[defense industry|defense]] communities expressed concern about the requirements for professional practice. This led to the creation of the Committee for the Advancement of Sanitary Engineering of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE). Later, the Joint Committee for the Advancement of Sanitary Engineering was formed, composed of the ASCE, the [[American Public Health Association]], the [[American Society for Engineering Education]], the [[American Water Works Association]] and the [[Water Environment Federation|Water Pollution Control Federation]]. With the sponsorship and support of these five organizations, the American Sanitary Engineering Intersociety Board was incorporated under the laws of the State of [[Delaware]] on October 21, 1955. Certified sanitary engineers were identified as Diplomates (now also known as Board Certified Environmental Engineers) of the American Academy of Sanitary Engineers, and were listed on a roster with the names of each member and their specialties as recognized by the Board. Other organizations joining as sponsors included the [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] in 1957 and the [[Air Pollution]] Control Association in 1962.

In 1966 the name of the Board was changed to the "Environmental Engineering Intersociety Board" (EEIB) and the name of the roster from the "American Academy of Sanitary Engineers" to the "American Academy of Environmental Engineers" (AAEE). A year later, in 1967, the Board of Trustees changed the American Academy of Environmental Engineers from just a roster of certified engineers to an organization with its own rights, bylaws and officers. This new organization was charged with working cooperatively with the EEIB in the advancement of all aspects of environmental engineering. The [[American Public Works Association]] joined as a sponsor of these organizations in 1969. The AAEE and the EEIB were merged into one organization in 1973. In 1976 the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] became a sponsor of the Academy and it was followed by the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors in 1977, the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] in 1981 and the Solid Waste Association of North America in 1988. In 2011, the Academy decided to award board certifications to environmental scientists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.aaee.net/DownloadCenter/AAEE-BCESPressRelease.pdf |title=AAEE Approves Environmental Scientist Certification/Name Change |publisher=American Academy of Environmental Engineers |date=2011-12-20 |accessdate=2012-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217160727/http://www.aaee.net/DownloadCenter/AAEE-BCESPressRelease.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the adoption of its current name on 1 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://myemail.constantcontact.com/AAEE-Highpoints---September-2012.html?soid=1102273204531&amp;aid=XxW79TH9tls |title=Environmental Engineering Foundation Votes To Change Name To Environmental Engineering and Science Foundation |volume=28 |number=8 |date=November 2012 |journal=Highlights |publisher=American Academy of Environmental Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Requirements for board certification include a baccalaureate or higher degree in engineering or science from an accredited university, not less than eight years of professional engineering or scientific experience, and an examination on the practice of environmental engineering or science in a particular area of specialization. Exams are offered on the following topics for engineers: [[Air pollution|Air Pollution Control]], [[Sustainability|Environmental Sustainability]], General Environmental Engineering, [[Hazardous waste|Hazardous Waste Management]], [[Industrial hygiene|Industrial Hygiene]], Radiation Protection, [[Waste management|Solid Waste Management]] and Water Supply/Wastewater Management.  Scientists may choose from tests covering Air Resources, Environmental Biology, [[Environmental chemistry|Environmental Chemistry]], [[Environmental microbiology|Environmental Microbiology]], [[Environmental toxicology|Environmental Toxicology]], Groundwater and the Subsurface Environment, Surface Water Resources, or [[Sustainability science|Sustainability Science]].&lt;ref name="Brochure"/&gt;

The '''Bank of English''' is a representative subset of the 4.5 billion words [[COBUILD]] [[text corpus|corpus]], a collection of English texts. These are mainly British in origin, but content from North America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries is also being included.

The majority of the texts are from written English, collected from websites, newspapers, magazines and books, but there is also a large component of spoken data using material from radio, TV and informal conversations. The Bank of English totals 650 million running words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collins.co.uk/page/The+Collins+Corpus The Collins Corpus]&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of the corpus are held both at [[HarperCollins]] Publishers and the [[University of Birmingham]]. The version at Birmingham can be accessed for academic research.

The Bank of English forms part of the ''Collins Word Web'' together with the French, German and Spanish corpora.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17484">[[File:Bynesian decay efflorescence.tif|thumb|Crystallized salt clusters ([[efflorescence]]) produced by Byne's disease on a gastropod shell's surface]]

'''Byne's disease''', more accurately known as '''Bynesian decay''', is a peculiar and permanently damaging condition (resulting from an ongoing [[chemical reaction]]) which often attacks [[mollusk shell]]s that are in storage or on [[Display case|display]] for long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Sally2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shelton |first=S. |year=1996 |title=The Shell Game: Mollusks Shell Deterioration in Collections and its Prevention |journal=The Festivus |volume=28 |issue=7 |pages=74–80 |url=http://s190418054.onlinehome.us/portal/1999/9908mon.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124152217/http://s190418054.onlinehome.us/portal/1999/9908mon.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bynesian decay is a form of [[efflorescence]] of [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] formed by the reaction of [[acid]]ic vapors with the [[base (chemistry)|basic]] shell surface. The efflorescence can sometimes superficially resemble a growth of [[mold]]. Although first described in the early 19th century, Bynesian decay was not well understood until almost a hundred years later. The condition is named after the man (L. Byne) who is best known for describing it in the late 19th century, even though he was not the first person to describe it in print. In addition, Byne mistakenly assumed that the condition was caused by [[bacteria]], and thus the condition came to be referred to as a "disease".

In addition to mollusk shells, various other [[natural history]] [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s are susceptible to this form of decay, including [[eggshell]]s&lt;ref name="RS2001"&gt;Ryhl-Svendsen, M. (2001). [http://iaq.dk/image/eggshell.htm "Bynes efflorescence on an egg shell"]. (IAQ): ''Museums and Archives''.&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[fossil]]s and [[mineral]] samples that are composed of [[calcium carbonate]]. This condition is of concern for [[museum]] scientists, and also for anyone who has a private collection of specimens of these kinds. In order to avoid Bynesian decay, the use of metal, non-reactive polymers and acid-free materials of archival quality are preferred over common paper, wood-based materials, ordinary glues and varnishes in collection environments. Management of affected specimens includes washing and thorough drying, with a subsequent reallocation to an archival setting.

==Appearance==

[[File:Bynesian Decay 001.JPG|thumb|Some affected mollusk shells. The efflorescence is clearly visible in both specimens. This decay was deliberately produced under extreme conditions.]]

Byne's disease can appear as a powdery white coating on a shell. It also often looks as if a shell has been "infected" with [[mold]]; however, under magnification the mold-like appearance is revealed to be a crystalline growth of salts.&lt;ref name="Tennent"/&gt;

==History==
In 1839, the [[British people|British]] [[naturalist]] and [[malacologist]] [[Thomas Brown (naturalist)|Thomas Brown]] (1785–1862) briefly mentioned this form of deterioration in his book ''A Conchologist's Text-Book''.&lt;ref name="Sally2"/&gt; Agnes Kenyon also described the condition in 1896, suggesting that "saline particles in the [[atmosphere]] [were] evidently exerting a [[corrosive]] effect".&lt;ref name="Sally2"/&gt;

;Origin of the name

In 1899, the British amateur [[conchology|conchologist]] and [[naturalist]] Loftus St. George Byne (1872–1947)&lt;ref name="Salisbury"&gt;Salisbury A. E. (1951). "Obituaries: Ronald Winckworth, 1884–1950". ''Proceedings of the malacological Society of London'' '''29''' (1951-1953, Part I): [http://mollus.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/29/1/5 5]-6.&lt;/ref&gt; described this condition,&lt;ref name="Callomon"&gt;Callomon, P. [http://www.conchologistsofamerica.org/articles/y2002/0209_callomon.asp "Byne’s Disease – Questions and Answers"]. Accessed 25 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; in a presentation to the [[Conchological Society of Great Britain]] in Ireland, and did so again in another presentation in June of that same year.&lt;ref name="Sally2"/&gt;

{{cquote|1=
...a dullness first pervading the exterior of certain smooth species more markedly e.g. ''[[Conus]]'', ''[[Cypraea]]'', and especially [[Naticidae]]. Then grey acid efflorescence, both tasting and smelling strongly of [[vinegar]] covers the whole surface like a powder, rising doubtless from the interior, and the specimens are soon almost irretrievably ruined.}}

Byne was convinced that [[butyric acid]] was present together with [[calcium acetate]] in the affected shells, although he never really described the methods he used in the so-called "extensive chemical tests" he claimed to  have applied to these [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s. Among other conclusions, he assumed that the butyric acid originated from [[bacteria]]l activity. He also concluded that the decaying effect 'travelled from shell to shell and drawer to drawer',&lt;ref name="Byne"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byne|first=L. St G.|year=1899|title=The corrosion of shells in cabinets|journal=Journal of Conchology|volume=9|issue=6|pages=172–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus the condition came to be called a "disease".&lt;ref name=Sally2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sally Byne's" /&gt;

;Clarification and resolution

The true nature of the "disease" was partially clarified in 1934, when the [[British government]] [[chemist]] John Ralph Nicholls explained that oak cabinets at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London were giving off acetic acid fumes, which were attacking the shells stored in them.&lt;ref name="Sally2"/&gt;

In 1985, almost 150 years after the Byne's disease was first mentioned in the literature, Norman H. Tennent and Thomas Baird published an extensive study on the subject. Their deep analysis, involving many complex and sophisticated techniques such as [[X-Ray diffraction]], [[infrared spectroscopy]], [[thermogravimetric analysis]] and [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]], finally revealed the true nature of the decaying process. They identified the substances involved (the [[calcium]] salts), as well as the [[chemical reaction]]s that originated them. They concluded that Byne's disease is not actually a disease, and is in fact caused by simple chemical reactions which occur in the presence of acidic vapors originating from the immediate environment in which the specimens are stored.&lt;ref name="Tennent"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1506091|last=Tennent|first=N. H.|author2=Baird, T.|year=1985|title=The Deterioration of Mollusca Collections: Identification of Shell Efflorescence|journal=Studies in Conservation|publisher=International Institute For Conservation Of Historic And Artistic Works (IIC)|volume=30|pages=73–85|issn=0039-3630|jstor=1506091|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==

Bynesian decay usually starts when specimens are stored or displayed for considerable periods of time in an enclosed space. The storage method itself usually causes this problem, when containers, cabinets or [[display case]]s are entirely or partially made of [[wood]], [[plywood]] or other wood products such as [[Masonite]], or when the specimens are surrounded by, or in contact with, various other kinds of materials that are [[cellulose]]-based and can turn water vapor [[acid]]ic.&lt;ref name="Sally Byne's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sturm"/&gt;

Other potentially damaging materials include non-archival quality [[Paperboard|cardboard]], card, [[paper]], [[cotton]] and [[Cork material|cork]], all of which give off acidic vapors over time. [[PVC]] and [[polyurethane]] plastics are also a problem, as they also degrade and give off acidic vapors with time.&lt;ref name="Sturm"/&gt; High [[humidity]] of the air is a significant contributing factor, as is lack of ventilation of the specimens. High ambient temperatures can increase the rapidity of the decay.&lt;ref name="Sally Byne's"/&gt;

Generally, in cabinets or display cases that are entirely or partially made of wood, the [[hydrolysis]] of [[acetyl]] groups in the wood [[hemicellulose]]s creates [[acetic acid]]. The rate at which the acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of [[esters]] in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment.&lt;ref name="Berndt"&gt;Berndt, H. (1987). [http://www.wag-aic.org/1987/berndt87.pdf "Assessing the Detrimental Effects of Wood and Wood Products on the Environment Inside Display Cases"]. AIC, Vancouver, BC.&lt;/ref&gt; Acidic fumes can also be released from [[formaldehyde]] which can occur in wood as a degradation product of [[lignin]]. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous [[formaldehyde]] [[resins]] (commonly [[urea-formaldehyde resins]]).&lt;ref name="Berndt"/&gt;

In the first case, acetic acid reacts with the calcium carbonate (one of the main components of freshwater, marine and land shells, birds' eggs and other such specimens) producing [[calcium acetate]], a salt. [[Formaldehyde]] can be oxidized by the oxygen in air to create [[formic acid]], which then has basically the same effects as [[acetic acid]], reacting with calcium carbonate to produce a salt. The salts ([[calcium acetate]] and [[calcium formate]]) crystallize through the specimen's outer surface, destroying its fine detail and exposing more areas for further reaction. As the condition progresses, the salt crystals build up over the specimen's surface, which becomes increasingly eroded.&lt;ref name="Sally Byne's"&gt;Shelton, S.Y. (2008). [http://www.nps.gov/history/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-15.pdf "Byne's "Disease; How to recognize, Handle and Store Affected Shells and Related Collections."] ''Conserve O Gram'' 11-15. National Park Service USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The calcium carbonate and acetic acid chemical reaction occurs as follows:&lt;ref name="Brokerhof"&gt;Brokerhof, A. (1999). [http://iaq.dk/iap/iap1998/1998_10.htm "Application of Sorbents To Protect Calcareous Materials Against Acetic Acid Vapours"]. Indoor Air Pollution: Detection and Mitigation of Carbonyls, Presentation Abstracts and Additional Notes. The University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland 17–18 June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Calcium carbonate|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2[[Acetic acid|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH]] → [[Calcium acetate|Ca(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] + [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Calcium carbonate and formic acid chemical reaction occurs as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Baltrusaitis, J., Usher, C. and Grassian, V. (2006). "Reactivity of Formic Acid on Calcium Carbonate Single Particle and Single Crystal Surfaces: Effect of Adsorbed Water". ''Microscopy and Microanalysis'' (Cambridge University Press) '''12'''(Suppl 2): 796-797.&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Calcium carbonate|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2[[Formic acid|CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → [[Calcium formate|Ca(HCOO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] + [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Calcium carbonate and sulfuric acid chemical reaction occurs as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Casiday, R. and Frey, R.
[http://www.chemistry.wustl.edu/~edudev/LabTutorials/Water/FreshWater/acidrain.html'''Acid Rain Inorganic Reactions Experiment''']. Department of Chemistry, Washington University.&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Calcium carbonate|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Sulfuric Acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] → [[Calcium sulfate|CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] + [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

In this last reaction, calcium carbonate reacts with [[sulfuric acid]] and produce calcium sulfate, water and carbon dioxide.

==Prevention==
When specimens are to be placed in any size of container for long-term storage or display, the consistent use of only archival-quality materials prevents the development of Byne's disease. Thus, materials such as metal cabinets and display cases, archival quality paper labels and card trays are used in museum collections of specimens that might be vulnerable to this reaction.&lt;ref name="Sally Byne's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sturm"/&gt;

It is also worth mentioning that sea shells, after collecting, need to be washed thoroughly in freshwater to remove the salt that is on and in the shell, and then dried thoroughly before they are stored. Salt attracts moisture and makes shells more vulnerable to Bynesian decay.&lt;ref name=Sally2 /&gt;

The following is a chart that shows non-archival materials and their archival equivalents:&lt;ref name=Sturm /&gt;

|-
|}

If possible, the use of wood and [[cellulose]] derivatives should be avoided entirely. Many [[varnish]]es and [[paint]]s are well known emitters of [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs),&lt;ref name="Tétreault"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1506710|last=Tétreault|first=J.|author2=Stamatopoulou, E.|year=1997|title=Determination of Concentrations of Acetic Acid Emitted from Wood Coatings in Enclosures|jstor=1506710|journal=Studies in Conservation|volume=42|issue=3|pages=141–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which may be acidic, and thus have the potential to damage calcium carbonate specimens. Because of this, these [[coating]]s should also be avoided; water-based varnishes and paints are considered less harmful, and should be preferred.&lt;ref name="Sturm"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturm|first=C. F. |author2=Pearce, T.A. |author3=Valdés, A.|title=The Mollusks: A Guide to their Study, Collection, and Preservation|publisher=Universal Publishers|year=2006|pages=45–57|chapter=Archival and Curatorial Methods|isbn=1-58112-930-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the reactions involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of [[moisture]] in the air in order for them to take place, keeping the air somewhat dry, i.e. keeping the environmental [[relative humidity]] under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring of the relative humidity (using instruments such as a [[hygrometer]]), and applying [[dehumidifiers]] when necessary; sometimes, simple [[air conditioning]] systems may suffice. Extremely low humidity can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a relative humidity maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate.&lt;ref name="Sally Byne's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sturm"/&gt; Applying [[sorbent]]s containing a [[strong base]], such as [[potassium hydroxide]], inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. Copy paper or KOH-impregnated [[filter paper]] are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These strong bases have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall acid [[concentration]] inside the enclosed space.&lt;ref name="Brokerhof"/&gt;

==Management==
The damage to specimens is unfortunately not reversible; however, the decay can be arrested by washing or soaking the specimens in water, followed by a very thorough drying. The specimens must then be placed in an environment that consists of only archival materials, in a completely archival setting.&lt;ref name=Sally2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sturm /&gt;

==Pyrite disease==
In collections which contain [[fossils]], high humidity can also affect [[pyrite]] (or its more reactive polymorph [[marcasite]]) (iron sulphide) fossils in a somewhat similar condition, which is known as [[marcasite#Pyrite Decay|pyrite disease]]. The [[iron sulfide]] can react with water and oxygen to form [[iron sulfate]]s and [[sulfuric acid]], which then can produce Bynesian decay.&lt;ref name="Sturm"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cavallari&amp;Salvador&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavallari|first1=D.C.|last2=Salvador|first2=R.B.|last3=Cunha|first3=B.R.|title=Dangers to malacological collections: Bynesian decay and Pyrite decay|journal=Collection Forum|date=2014|volume=28|issue=1-2|pages=35–46|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel_Cavallari/publication/269112497_Dangers_to_malacological_collections_Bynesian_decay_and_pyrite_decay/links/549b14ca0cf2d6581ab2e158.pdf?origin=publication_detail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CEA-Leti, a Grenoble, France-based research institute for electronics and information technologies''', is one of the world’s largest organizations for applied research in microelectronics and nanotechnology.

==Overview==

A subsidiary of the ''Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives'' ([[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique|CEA]]) France’s nuclear and renewable energy commission, Leti was established in 1967 in [[Grenoble]], a university town in the French Alps that has now become an internationally recognized scientific hub. Today, the CEA-Leti is granted over 286 patents a year and handles a portfolio of more than 2,200 patented inventions.

The institute employs 1,700 people, while training more than 162 graduate students (38% foreigners), 36 PostDoc and hosting 200 collaborators from its research and industrial partners. It has extensive facilities for micro- and [[nanotechnology]] research, including 200mm and 300mm fabrication lines, 11,000m² of [[cleanroom]] space, and laboratories and equipment that provide first-class nanoscale characterization, chemistry and biology, photonics, design and upstream research capabilities.

==Mission==

Leti’s mission is to create and transfer to industry novel technologies, capable of improving the quality of life of individuals worldwide. Leti does this by helping companies to bridge the gap between basic research and manufacturing, creating new spin-off companies and drawing on its extensive know-how to help its industrial partners to excel. In all its activities, Leti maintains a focus on usefulness and manufacturability.

==Milestones==

Leti’s European partnerships are aimed at strengthening Europe’s competitive position in key technological areas and developing new technologies. Examples include:
* The Heterogeneous Technology Alliance (which links four European research institutes)
* pHotonics ELectronics functional Integration on CMOS (HELIOS)
* WADIMOS, for demonstrating a photonic interconnect layer on [[CMOS]]
* EARTH, energy efficiency in mobile broadband systems

==Spinoffs==

Since its early days, Leti has encouraged the transfer of technology to private industry through an ambitious spinoff program that supports the formation of new companies. Thus far, 37 companies have been formed as Leti spinoffs, resulting in the creation of more than 2,500 jobs.

One of the most successful of these new companies is the Soitec Group, a Bernin, France-based developer of silicon-on-insulator and other related semiconductor substrate technologies, which spun off from Leti in 1992. Soitec, which is listed on the Euronext Paris exchange, reported sales of €$209 million during the fiscal year ended in March 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39437">'''Collaborative information seeking''' ('''CIS''') is a field of research that involves studying situations, motivations, and methods for people working in collaborative groups for information seeking projects, as well as building systems for supporting such activities. Such projects often involve information searching or [[information retrieval]] (IR), information gathering, and [[information sharing]]. Beyond that, CIS can extend to collaborative information synthesis and collaborative [[sense-making]].

==Background==
Seeking for information is often considered a solo activity, but there are many situations that call for people working together for [[information seeking]]. Such situations are typically complex in nature, and involve working through several sessions exploring, evaluating, and gathering relevant information. Take for example, a couple going on a trip. They have the same goal, and in order to accomplish their goal, they need to seek out several kinds of information, including flights, hotels, and sightseeing. This may involve them working together over multiple sessions, exploring and collecting useful information, and collectively making decisions that help them move toward their common goal.

It is a common knowledge that collaboration is either necessary or highly desired in many activities that are complex or difficult to deal with for an individual. Despite its natural appeal and situational necessity, collaboration in information seeking is an understudied domain. The nature of the available information and its role in our lives have changed significantly, but the methods and tools that are used to access and share that information in collaboration have remained largely unaltered. People still use general-purpose systems such as email and IM for doing CIS projects, and there is a lack of specialized tools and techniques to support CIS explicitly.

There are also several models to explain [[information seeking]] and [[information behavior]],&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, M. and Jansen, B. J. (2007) [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/pubs/reddy_jansen_collaborative_information_searching.pdf A model for understanding collaborative information behavior in context: A study of two healthcare teams], Information Processing &amp; Management. 44 (1), 256-273.&lt;/ref&gt; but the areas of collaborative information seeking and collaborative information behavior remain understudied. On the theory side, Shah has presented C5 Model&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C. (2008, June 20). Toward collaborative information seeking (CIS). Position Paper in Proceedings of Collaborative Exploratory Search workshop at JCDL 2008, Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C., &amp; Leeder, C. (2016). Exploring Collaborative Work Among Graduate Students Through the C5 Model of Collaboration: A Diary Study. Journal of Information Science (JIS), 42(5), pp. 609-629. &lt;/ref&gt; for studying collaborative situations, including [[information seeking]]. On the practical side, a few specialized systems for supporting CIS have emerged in the recent past, but their usage and evaluations have underwhelmed. Despite such limitations, the field of CIS has been getting a lot of attention lately, and several promising theories and tools have come forth. Multiple reviews of CIS related literature are written by Shah.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C (2010). Collaborative Information Seeking: A Literature Review, in Anne Woodsworth (ed.) Advances in Librarianship (Advances in Librarianship, Volume 32), Emerald Group Publishing Limited, pp.3-33.&lt;/ref&gt; Shah's book&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C (2012).

==Theories==
Depending upon what one includes or excludes while talking about CIS, we have many or hardly any theories. If we consider the past work on the [[groupware]] systems, many interesting insights can be obtained about people working on collaborative projects, the issues they face, and the guidelines for system designers. One of the notable works is by Grudin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grudin | first1 = J | year = 1994 | title = Groupware and social dynamics: eight challenges for developers | url = | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 92–105 | doi=10.1145/175222.175230}}&lt;/ref&gt; who laid out eight design principles for developers of [[groupware]] systems.

The discussion below is primarily based on some of the recent works in the field of computer supported cooperative work [[CSCW]], collaborative IR, and CIS.

===Definitions and terminology===

(2008). Toward Collaborative Information Seeking (CIS). In Proceedings of JCDL 2008 Workshop on Collaborative Exploratory Search, Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; which are often used interchangeably.

There are several definitions of such related or similar terms in the literature. For instance, Foster&lt;ref&gt;Foster, J. (2006). Collaborative information seeking and retrieval. Annual Review of Information Science and Technology (ARIST), 40:329–356.&lt;/ref&gt; defined collaborative IR as ''"the study of the systems and practices that enable individuals to collaborate during the seeking, searching, and retrieval of information."'' Shah&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C. (2009). Lessons and challenges for Collaborative Information Seeking (CIS) systems developers. In Proceedings of GROUP 2009 Workshop on Collaborative Information Behavior, Sanibel Island, Florida.&lt;/ref&gt; defined CIS as a process of collaboratively seeking information that is ''"defined explicitly among the participants, interactive, and mutually beneficial."'' While there is still a lack of a definition or a terminology that is universally accepted, but most agree that CIS is an active process, as opposed to [[collaborative filtering]], where a system connects the users based on their passive involvement (e.g., buying similar products on Amazon).

===Models of collaboration===
Foley and Smeaton&lt;ref name="fs2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foley | first1 = Colum | last2 = Smeaton | first2 = Alan F. | year = 2010 | title = Division of labour and sharing of knowledge for synchronous collaborative information retrieval | doi = 10.1016/j.ipm.2009.10.010 | journal = Inf. Process. Manage | volume = 46 | issue = 6| pages = 762–772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  defined two key aspects of collaborative information seeking as ''division of labor'' and the ''sharing of knowledge''. Division of labor allows collaborating searchers to tackle larger problems by reducing the duplication of effort (e.g., finding documents that one's collaborator has already discovered). The sharing of knowledge allows searchers to influence each other's activities as they interact with the retrieval system in pursuit of their (often evolving) information need. This influence can occur in real time if the collaborative search system supports it, or it can occur in a turn-taking, asynchronous manner if that is how interaction is structured.

[[Jaime Teevan|Teevan]] ''et al.''&lt;ref name="tmb2009"&gt;Jaime Teevan, Meredith Ringel Morris, and Steve Bush. 2009. Discovering and using groups to improve personalized search. In Proceedings of the Second ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM '09), Ricardo Baeza-Yates, Paolo Boldi, Berthier Ribeiro-Neto, and B. Barla Cambazoglu (Eds.). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 15-24. DOI=10.1145/1498759.1498786 http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1498759.1498786&lt;/ref&gt;  characterized two classes of collaboration, task-based vs. trait-based. Task-based collaboration corresponds to intentional collaboration; trait-based collaboration facilitates the sharing of knowledge through inferred similarity of information need.

===Situations, motivations, and methods===
One of the important issues to study in CIS is the instance, reason, and the methods behind a collaboration. For instance, Morris,&lt;ref name="Morris, M. R. 2008"&gt;Morris, M. R. (2008). A survey of collaborative web search practices. In Proceedings of SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pages 1657–1660, Florence, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; using a survey with 204 [[knowledge worker]]s at a large technology company found that people often like and want to collaborate, but they do not find specialized tools to help them in such endeavors. Some of the situations for doing collaborative information seeking in this survey were travel planning, shopping, and literature search. Shah,&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C (2010). Working in Collaboration - What, Why, and How? Proceedings of Collaborative Information Retrieval workshop at CSCW 2010. Savannah, GA: February 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, using personal interviews, identified three main reasons why people collaborate.
#''Requirement/setup''. Sometimes a group of people are "forced" to collaborate. Example includes a merger between two companies.
#''Division of labor''. Working together may help the participants to distribute the workload. Example includes a group of students working on a class project.
#''Diversity of skills''. Often people get together because they could not individually possess the required set of skills. Example includes co-authorship, where different authors bring different set of skills to the table.

As far as the tools and/or methods for CIS are concerned, both Morris and Shah found that email is still the most used tool. Other popular methods are face-to-face meetings, IM, and phone or conference calls. In general, the choice of the method or tool for our respondents depended on their situation (co-located or remote), and objective (brainstorming or working on independent parts).

===Space-time organization of CIS systems and methods===
The classical way of organizing collaborative activities is based on two factors: location and time.&lt;ref name="Rodden, T. 1991"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rodden | first1 = T | year = 1991 | title = A Survey of CSCW Systems | url = | journal = Interacting with Computers | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 319–353 | doi=10.1016/0953-5438(91)90020-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently Hansen &amp; Jarvelin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = P. | last2 = Jarvelin | first2 = K. | year = 2005 | title = Collaborative information retrieval in an information-intensive domain | url = | journal = Information Processing and Management | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 1101–1119 | doi=10.1016/j.ipm.2004.04.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Golovchinsky, Pickens, &amp; Back&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Golovchinsky, G., Pickens, J., and Back, M. (2008b). A taxonomy of collaboration in online information seeking. In Proceedings of JCDL 2008 Workshop on Collaborative Exploratory Search, Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; also classified approaches to collaborative IR using these two dimensions of space and time. See "Browsing is a Collaborative Process",&lt;ref&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.40.9584&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt; where the authors depict various library activities on these two dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Twidale, M. B. and Nichols, D. M. (1996). Collaborative browsing and visualisation of the search process. In Proceedings of Aslib, volume 48, pages 177–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

As we can see from this figure, the majority of collaborative activities in conventional libraries are co-located and synchronous, whereas collaborative activities relating to digital libraries are more remote and synchronous. Social information filtering, or collaborative filtering, as we saw earlier, is a process benefitting from other users' actions in the past; thus, it falls under asynchronous and mostly remote domain. These days email also serves as a tool for doing asynchronous collaboration among users who are not co-located. Chat or IM (represented as 'internet' in the figure) helps to carry out synchronous and remote collaboration.

Rodden,&lt;ref name="Rodden, T. 1991"/&gt; similarly, presented a classification of CSCW systems using the form of interaction and the geographical nature of cooperative systems. Further, Rodden &amp; Blair&lt;ref&gt;Rodden, T. and Blair, G. (1991). CSCW and distributed systems: the problem of control. In Proceedings of ECSCW, pages 49–64, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; presented an important characteristic to all CSCW systems – control. According to the authors, two predominant control mechanisms have emerged within CSCW systems: speech act theory systems, and procedure based systems. These mechanisms are tightly coupled with the kind of control the system can support in a collaborative environment (discussed later).

Often researchers also talk about other dimensions, such as intentionality and depth of mediation (system mediated or user mediated),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; while classifying various CIS systems.

===Control, communication, and awareness===
Three components specific to group-work or collaboration that are highly predominant in the CIS or CSCW literature are control, communication, and awareness. In this section key definitions and related works for these components will be highlighted. Understanding their roles can also help us address various design issues with CIS systems.

====Control====
Rodden identified the value of control in CSCW systems and listed a number of projects with their corresponding schemes for implementing for control. For instance, the COSMOS project&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur, S. B. and Young, R. E. (1988). The COSMOS project: a multi-disciplinary approach to design of computer supported group working. In Speth, R., editor, EUTECO 88: Research into Networks and Distributed Applications, Vienna, Austria.&lt;/ref&gt; had a formal structure to represent control in the system. They used roles to represent people or automatons, and rules to represent the flow and processes. Roles of the people could be supervisor, processor, or analyst. Rules could be a condition that a process needs to satisfy in order to start or finish. Due to such a structure seen in projects like COSMOS, Rodden classified these control systems as procedural based systems.

====Communication====
This is one of the most critical components of any collaboration. In fact, Rodden (1991) identified message or communication systems as the class of systems in CSCW that is most mature and most widely used.

Since the focus here is on CIS systems that allow its participants to engage in an intentional and interactive collaboration, there must be a way for the participants to communicate with each other. What is interesting to note is that often, collaboration could begin by letting a group of users communicate with each other. For instance, Donath &amp; Robertson&lt;ref&gt;Donath, J. S. and Robertson, N. (1994). The sociable web. In Proceedings of WWW Conference, CERN, Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; presented a system that allows a user to know that others were currently viewing the same webpage and communicate with those people to initiate a possible collaboration or at least a co-browsing experience. Providing communication capabilities even in an environment that was not originally designed for carrying out collaboration is an interesting way of encouraging collaboration.

====Awareness====
Awareness, in the context of CSCW, has been defined as ''"an understanding of the activities of others, which provides a context for your own activity"''.&lt;ref&gt;Dourish, P. and Bellotti, V. (1992). Awareness and coordination in shared workspaces. In Proceedings of ACM CSCW, pages 107–114, Toronto, Ontario.&lt;/ref&gt; The following four kinds of awareness are often discussed and addressed in the CSCW literature:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liechti | first1 = O. | last2 = Sumi | first2 = Y. | year = 2002 | title = Awareness and the WWW | url = | journal = International Journal of Human Computer Studies | volume = 56 | issue = 1| pages = 1–5 | doi=10.1006/ijhc.2001.0512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#''Group awareness.'' This kind of awareness includes providing information to each group member about the status and activities of the other collaborators at a given time.
#''Workspace awareness.'' This refers to a common workspace that the group has where they can bring and discuss their findings, and create a common product.
#''Contextual awareness.'' This type of awareness relates to the application domain, rather than the users. Here, we want to identify what content is useful for the group, and what the goals are for the current project.
#''Peripheral awareness.'' This relates to the kind of information that has resulted from personal and the group's collective history, and should be kept separate from what a participant is currently viewing or doing.

Shah and Marchionini&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C., &amp; Marchionini, G. (2010). Awareness in Collaborative Information Seeking. Journal of American Society of Information Science and Technology (JASIST), 61(10), 1970-1986.&lt;/ref&gt; studied awareness as provided by interface in collaborative information seeking. They found that one needs to provide "right" (not too little, not too much, and appropriate for the task at hand) kind of awareness to reduce the cost of coordination and maximize the benefits of collaboration.

==Systems==
A number of specialized systems have been developed back from the days of the [[groupware]] systems to today's Web 2.0 interfaces. A few such examples, in chronological order, are given below.

===Ariadne===
Twidale et al.&lt;ref&gt;Twidale, M. B., Nichols, D. M., and Paice, C. D. (1995). Supporting collaborative learning during information searching. In Proceedings of Computer Supported Col- laborative Learning (CSCL), pages 367–374, Bloomington, Indiana.&lt;/ref&gt; developed Ariadne to support the collaborative learning of database browsing skills. In addition to enhancing the opportunities and effectiveness of the collaborative learning that already occurred, Ariadne was designed to provide the facilities that would allow collaborations to persist as people increasingly searched information remotely and had less opportunity for spontaneous face-to-face collaboration.

Ariadne was developed in the days when Telnet-based access to library catalogs was a common practice. Building on top of this command-line interface, Ariadne could capture the users’ input and the database’s output, and form them into a search history that consisted of a series of command-output pairs. Such a separation of capture and display allowed Ariadne to work with various forms of data capture methods.

To support complex browsing processes in collaboration, Ariadne presented a visualization of the search process.&lt;ref&gt;http://people.lis.illinois.edu/~twidale/irinterfaces/ariadne.gif&lt;/ref&gt; This visualization consisted of thumbnails of screens, looking like playing cards, which represented command-output pairs. Any such card can be expanded to reveal its details. The horizontal axis on Ariadne’s display represented time, and the vertical axis showed information on the semantics of the action it represented: the top row for the top level menus, the middle row for specifying a search, and the bottom row for looking at particular book details.

This visualization of the search process in Ariadne makes it possible to annotate, discuss with colleagues around the screen, and distribute to remote collaborators for asynchronous commenting easily and effectively. As we saw in the previous section, having access to one’s history as well as the history of one’s collaborators are very crucial to effective collaboration. Ariadne implements these requirements with the features that let one visualize, save, and share a search process. In fact, the authors found one of the advantages of search visualization was the ability to recap previous searching sessions easily in a multi-session exploratory searching.

===SearchTogether===
More recently, one of the collaborative information seeking tools that have caught a lot of attention is SearchTogether, developed by Morris and [[Eric Horvitz|Horvitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris, M. R. and Horvitz, E. (2007). SearchTogether: An Interface for Collaborative Web Search. In ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST), pages 3–12, Newport, RI.&lt;/ref&gt; The design of this tool was motivated by a survey that the researchers did with 204 knowledge workers,&lt;ref name="Morris, M. R. 2008"/&gt; in which they discovered the following.
* A majority of respondents wanted to collaborate while searching on the Web.
* The most common ways of collaborating in information seeking tasks are sending emails back and forth, using IM to exchange links and query terms, and using phone calls while looking at a Web browser.
* Some of the most popular Web searching tasks on which people like to collaborate are planning travels or social events, making expensive purchases, researching medical conditions, and looking for information related to a common project.

Based on the survey responses, and the current and desired practices for collaborative search, the authors of SearchTogether identified three key features for supporting people’s collaborative information behavior while searching on the Web: awareness, division of labor, and persistence. Let us look at how these three features are implemented.

SearchTogether instantiates ''awareness'' in several ways, one of which is per-user query histories. This is done by showing each group member’s screen name, his/her photo and queries in the “Query Awareness” region. The access to the query histories is immediate and interactive, as clicking on a query brings back the results of that query from when it was executed. The authors identified query awareness as a very important feature in collaborative searching, which allows group members to not only share their query terms, but also learn better query formulation techniques from one another.

Another component of SearchTogether that facilitates awareness is the display of page-specific metadata. This region includes several pieces of information about the displayed page, including group members who viewed the given page, and their comments and ratings. The authors claim that such visitation information can help one either choose to avoid a page already visited by someone in the group to reduce the duplication of efforts, or perhaps choose to visit such pages, as they provide a sign of promising leads as indicated by the presence of comments and/or ratings.

''Division of labor'' in SearchTogether is implemented in three ways: (1) “Split Search” allows one to split the search results among all online group members in a round-robin fashion, (2) “Multi-Engine Search” takes a query and runs it on n different search engines, where ''n'' is the number of online group members, (3) manual division of labor can be facilitated using integrated IM.

Finally, the ''persistence'' feature in SearchTogether is instantiated by storing all the objects and actions, including IM conversations, query histories, recommendation queues, and page-specific metadata. Such data about all the group members are available to each member when he/she logs in. This allows one to easily carry a multi-session collaborative project.

===Cerchiamo===

Cerchiamo&lt;ref name="pgsqb08"&gt;Jeremy Pickens, Gene Golovchinsky, Chirag Shah, Pernilla Qvarfordt, and Maribeth Back. 2008. Algorithmic mediation for collaborative exploratory search. In Proceedings of the 31st annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval (SIGIR '08). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 315-322. DOI=10.1145/1390334.1390389 http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1390334.1390389
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gapqb08"&gt;Gene Golovchinsky, John Adcock, Jeremy Pickens, Pernilla Qvarfordt, and Maribeth Back. CerchiamoL a collaborative exploratory search tool. Demo presented at the 2008 ACM conference on computer supported cooperative work (CSCW 2008), San Diego, CA, November 08–12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  is a collaborative information seeking tool that explores issues related to algorithmic mediation of information seeking activities and how collaborators' roles can be used to structure the user interface. Cerchiamo introduced the notion of algorithmic mediation, that is, the ability of the system to collect input asynchronously from multiple collaborating searchers, and to use these multiple streams of input to affect the information that is being retrieved and displayed to the searchers.

Cerchiamo collected judgments of relevance from multiple collaborating searchers and used those judgments to create a ranked list of items that were potentially relevant to the information need. This algorithm prioritized items that were retrieved by multiple queries and that were retrieved by queries that also retrieved many other relevant documents. This rank fusion is just one way in which a search system that manages activities of multiple collaborating searchers can combine their inputs to generate results that are better than those produced by individuals working independently.

Cerchiamo implemented two roles&amp;mdash;Prospector and Miner&amp;mdash;that searchers could assume. Each role had an associated interface. The Prospector role/interface focused on running many queries and making a few judgments of relevance for each query to explore the information space. The Miner role/interface focused on making relevance judgments on a ranked list of items selected from items retrieved by all queries in the current session. This combination of roles allowed searchers to explore and exploit the information space, and led teams to discover more unique relevant documents than pairs of individuals working separately.&lt;ref name="pgsqb08" /&gt;

===Coagmento===
[http://www.coagmento.org Coagmento] (Latin for "working together") is a new and unique system that allows a group of people work together for their information seeking tasks without leaving their browsers. [http://www.coagmento.org Coagmento] has been developed with a client-server architecture, where the client is implemented as a Firefox plug-in that helps multiple people working in collaboration to communicate, and search, share and organize information. The server component stores and provides all the objects and actions collected from the client. Due to this decoupling, [http://www.coagmento.org Coagmento] provides a flexible architecture that allows its users to be co-located or remote, working synchronously or asynchronously, and use different platforms.

[http://www.coagmento.org Coagmento] includes a toolbar and a sidebar. The toolbar has several buttons that helps one collect information and be aware of the progress in a given collaboration. The toolbar has three major parts:
* ''Buttons for collecting information and making annotations.'' These buttons help one save or remove a webpage, make annotations on a webpage, and highlight and collect text snippets.
* ''Page-specific statistics.'' The middle portion of the toolbar shows various statistics, such as the number of views, annotations, and snippets, for the displayed page. A user can click on a given statistic and obtain more information. For instance, clicking on the number of snippets will bring up a window that shows all the snippets collected by the collaborators from the displayed page.
* ''Project-specific statistics.'' The last portion of the toolbar displays task/project name and various statistics, including number of pages visited and saved, about the current project. Clicking on that portion brings up the workspace where one can view all the collected objects (pages and snippets) brought in by the collaborators for that project.

The sidebar features a chat window, under which there are three tabs with the history of search engine queries, saved pages and snippets. With each of these objects, the user who created or collected that object is shown. Anyone in the group can access an object by clicking on it. For instance, one can click on a query issued by anyone in the group to re-run that query and bring up the results in the main browser window.

An [[Android (operating system)]] app for Coagmento can be found in the [https://market.android.com/details?id=com.coagmento.mobile Android Market].

===Cosme===
Fernandez-Luna et al.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez-Luna, J. M., Huete, J. F., Perez-Vazquez, R., Rodriguez-Cano, J. C., and Shah, C. (2010). COSME: A NetBeans IDE plug-in as a team-centric alternative for search driven software development. In Proceedings of GROUP 2010 Workshop on Collaborative Information Seeking, Sanibel Island, Florida, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; introduce Cosme (COde Search MEeting) as a NetBeans IDE plug-in that enables remote team of software developers to collaborate in real time during source-code search sessions. The COSME design was motivated by early stadies of C. Foley, M. R. Morris, C. Shah, among others researchers, and by habits of software developers identified in a survey of 117 universities students and professors related with projects of software development, as well as to computer programmers of some companies. The five more commons collaborative search habits (or related to it) of the interviewees was:

* Revision of problems by the team in the workstation of one of them.
* Suggest addresses of Web pages that they have already visited previously, digital books stored in some FTP, or source files of a version control system.
* Send emails with algorithms or explanatory text.
* Division of search tasks among each member of the team for sharing the final result.
* Store relevant information in individual workstation.

COSME is designed to enable either synchronous or asynchronous, but explicit remote collaboration among team developers with shared technical information needs. Its client user interface include a search panel that lets developers to specify queries, division of labor principle (possible combination include the use of different search engines, ranking fusion, and split algorithms), searching field (comments, source-code, class or methods declaration), and the collection type (source-code files or digital documentation). The sessions panel wraps the principal options to management the collaborative search sessions, which consists in a team of developers working together to satisfy their shared technical information needs. For example, a developer can use the embedded chat room to negotiate the creation of a collaborative search session, and show comments of the current and historical search results. The implementation of Cosme was based on CIRLab (Collaborative Information Retrieval Laboratory) instantiation, a groupware framework for CIS research and experimentation, Java as programming language, NetBeans IDE Platform as plug-in base, and Amenities (A MEthodology for aNalysis and desIgn of cooperaTIve systEmS) as software engineering methodology.

==Open-source application frameworks and toolkits==
CIS systems development is a complex task, which involves software technologies and Know-how  in different areas such as distributed programming, information search and retrieval, collaboration among people, task coordination and many others according to the context. This situation is not ideal because it requires great programming efforts. Fortunately, some CIS application frameworks and toolkits are increasing their popularity since they have a high reusability impact for both developers and researchers, like Coagmento Collaboratory and DrakkarKeel.

==Future research directions==
{{originalsyn|section|date=January 2016}}
Many interesting and important questions remain to be addressed in the field of CIS, including
# Why do people collaborate? Identifying their motivations can help us design better support for their specific needs.
# What additional tools are required to enhance existing methods of collaboration, given a specific domain?
# How to evaluate various aspects of collaborative information seeking, including system and user performance?
# How to measure the costs and benefits of collaboration?
# What are the information seeking situations in which collaboration is beneficial? When does it not pay off?
# How can we measure the performance of a collaborative group?
# How can we measure the contribution of an individual in a collaborative group?
# What sorts of retrieval algorithms can be used to combine input from multiple searchers?
# What kinds of algorithmic mediation can improve team performance?

The '''Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures''' ('''CVE''') system provides a reference-method for publicly known [[information security|information-security]] [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] and exposures. The [[National Cybersecurity FFRDC]], operated by the [[Mitre Corporation]], maintains the system, with funding from the [[National Cyber Security Division]] of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= CVE – Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures |publisher= [[Mitre Corporation]] |date= 2007-07-03 |url= https://cve.mitre.org/ |accessdate= 2009-06-18 |quote= CVE is sponsored by the National Cyber Security Division of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- From WP:MOSTM: "Follow standard English text formatting and capitalization rules, regardless of the preference of trademark owners." DO NOT change Mitre back to all-caps. --&gt;

The [[Security Content Automation Protocol]] uses CVE, and CVE IDs are listed on MITRE's system&lt;ref name="MITRE's System"&gt;[https://cve.mitre.org cve.mitre.org]. CVE® International in scope and free for public use, CVE is a dictionary of publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the US [[National Vulnerability Database]].

=={{Anchor|IDENTIFIERS}}CVE identifiers==
MITRE Corporation's documentation defines CVE Identifiers (also called "CVE names", "CVE numbers", "CVE-IDs", and "CVEs") as unique, common identifiers for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities in publicly released software packages. Historically, CVE identifiers had a status of "candidate" ("CAN-") and could then be promoted to entries ("CVE-"), however this practice was ended some time ago and all identifiers are now assigned as CVEs. The assignment of a CVE number is not a guarantee that it will become an official CVE entry (e.g. a CVE may be improperly assigned to an issue which is not a security vulnerability, or which duplicates an existing entry).

CVEs are assigned by a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA);&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title= CVE - CVE Numbering Authorities |publisher= [[Mitre Corporation]] |date= 2015-02-01 |url= https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html |accessdate= 2015-11-15}}
&lt;/ref&gt; there are three primary types of CVE number assignments:

# The [[Mitre Corporation]] functions as Editor and Primary CNA
# Various CNAs assign CVE numbers for their own products (e.g. Microsoft, Oracle, HP, Red Hat, etc.)
# A third-party coordinator such as [[CERT Coordination Center]] may assign CVE numbers for products not covered by other CNAs

When investigating a vulnerability or potential vulnerability it helps to acquire a CVE number early on. CVE numbers may not appear in the MITRE or NVD CVE databases for some time (days, weeks, months or potentially years) due to issues that are embargoed (the CVE number has been assigned but the issue has not been made public), or in cases where the entry is not researched and written up by MITRE due to resource issues. The benefit of early CVE candidacy is that all future correspondence can refer to the CVE number. Information on getting CVE identifiers for issues with open source projects is available from [[Red Hat]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title= CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO |publisher= [[Red Hat Inc.]] |date= 2012-06-18 |url= https://people.redhat.com/kseifrie/CVE-OpenSource-Request-HOWTO.html |accessdate= 2013-07-06

&lt;/ref&gt;

CVEs are for software that has been publicly released; this can include betas and other pre-release versions if they are widely used. Commercial software is included in the "publicly released" category, however custom-built software that is not distributed would generally not be given a CVE. Additionally services (e.g. a Web-based email provider) are not assigned CVEs for vulnerabilities found in the service (e.g. an XSS vulnerability) unless the issue exists in an underlying software product that is publicly distributed.

==CVE data fields==
The CVE database contains several fields:

===Description===
This is a standardized text description of the issue(s). One common entry is:

 ** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an organization or individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem. When the candidate has been publicized, the details for this candidate will be provided. 

This means that the entry number has been reserved by Mitre for an issue or a CNA has reserved the number. So in the case where a CNA requests a block of CVE numbers in advance (e.g. Red Hat currently requests CVEs in blocks of 500), the CVE number will be marked as reserved even though the CVE itself may not be assigned by the CNA for some time. Until the CVE is assigned AND Mitre is made aware of it (i.e., the embargo passes and the issue is made public), AND Mitre has researched the issue and written a description of it, entries will show up as "**RESERVED **".

===References===
This is a list of URLs and other information (such as vendor advisory numbers) for this issue.

===Date entry created===
This is the date the entry was created. For CVEs assigned directly by Mitre, this is the date Mitre created the CVE entry. For CVEs assigned by CNAs (e.g. Microsoft, Oracle, HP, Red Hat, etc.) this is also the date the entry was create by Mitre, not by the CNA. So in the case where a CNA requests a block of CVE numbers in advance (e.g. Red Hat currently requests CVEs in blocks of 500) the entry date would be when that CVE is assigned to the CNA. The CVE itself may not be used for days, weeks, months or even possibly years (e.g. Red Hat maintains blocks of CVEs for older security issues in open-source software that were not assigned CVEs yet).

===Obsolete fields===
The following fields were previously used in older CVE records, but are no longer used.

* Phase: The phase the CVE is in (e.g. CAN, CVE).
* Votes: Previously board members would vote yea or nay on whether or not the CAN should be accepted and turned into a CVE. 
* Comments: Comments on the issue. 
* Proposed: When the issue was first proposed.

==Changes to syntax==
In order to support CVE ID's beyond CVE-YEAR-9999 (aka the CVE10k problem) a change was made to the CVE syntax in 2014 and took effect on Jan 13, 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cve.mitre.org/cve/identifiers/syntaxchange.html |website=cve.mitre.org |date=September 13, 2016 &lt;!--Last Updated or Reviewed--&gt; |title=CVE - CVE ID Syntax Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new CVE-ID syntax is variable length and includes:

CVE prefix + Year + Arbitrary Digits

NOTE: The variable length arbitrary digits will begin at four (4) fixed digits and expand with arbitrary digits only when needed in a calendar year, for example, CVE-YYYY-NNNN and if needed CVE-YYYY-NNNNN, CVE-YYYY-NNNNNN, and so on. This also means there will be no changes needed to previously assigned CVE-IDs, which all include a minimum of 4 digits.

==CVE SPLIT and MERGE==
CVE attempts to assign one CVE per security issue, however in many cases this would lead to an extremely large number of CVEs (e.g. where several dozen cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are found in a PHP application due to lack of use of htmlspecialchars() or the insecure creation of files in /tmp). To deal with this there are guidelines (subject to change) that cover the splitting and merging of issues into distinct CVE numbers. As a general guideline one should first consider issues to be merged, then issues should be split by the type of vulnerability (e.g. [[buffer overflow]] vs. [[stack overflow]]), then by the software version affected (e.g. if one issue affects version 1.3.4 through 2.5.4 and the other affects 1.3.4 through 2.5.8 they would be SPLIT) and then by the reporter of the issue (e.g. Alice reports one issue and Bob reports another issue the issues would be SPLIT into separate CVE numbers). Another example is Alice reports a /tmp file creation vulnerability in version 1.2.3 and earlier of ExampleSoft web browser, in addition to this issue several other /tmp file creation issues are found, in some cases this may be considered as two reporters (and thus SPLIT into two separate CVEs, or if Alice works for ExampleSoft and an ExampleSoft internal team finds the rest it may be MERGE'ed into a single CVE). Conversely issues can be merged, e.g. if Bob finds 145 XSS vulnerabilities in ExamplePlugin for ExampleFrameWork regardless of the versions affected and so on they may be merged into a single CVE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cve.mitre.org/cve/editorial_policies/cd_abstraction.html CVE Abstraction Content Decisions: Rationale and Application]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Search CVE identifiers==
The Mitre CVE database can be searched at the [https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html CVE List Search], and the NVD CVE database can be searched at [https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/search Search CVE and CCE Vulnerability Database].

==CVE usage==
CVE identifiers are intended for use with respect to identifying vulnerabilities:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a dictionary of common names (i.e., CVE Identifiers) for publicly known information security vulnerabilities. CVE’s common identifiers make it easier to share data across separate network security databases and tools, and provide a baseline for evaluating the coverage of an organization’s security tools. If a report from one of your security tools incorporates CVE Identifiers, you may then quickly and accurately access fix information in one or more separate CVE-compatible databases to remediate the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= CVE - About CVE|url= https://cve.mitre.org/about/|website= cve.mitre.org|accessdate= 2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Users who have been assigned a CVE identifier for a vulnerability are encouraged to ensure that they place the identifier in any related security reports, web pages, emails, and so on.

[[File:DDR2 ram mounted.jpg|thumb|1 [[Gibibyte|GiB]] of [[Synchronous dynamic random access memory|SDRAM]] mounted in a [[personal computer]]. An example of ''primary'' storage.]]
[[File:IBM DJNA-351520 Hard Disk A.jpg|thumb|15 [[Gibibyte|GiB]] [[Parallel ATA|PATA]] hard disk drive (HDD) from 1999; when connected to a computer it serves as ''secondary'' storage.]]

'''Computer data storage''', often called '''storage''' or '''memory''', is a technology consisting of [[computer]] components and [[Data storage device|recording media]] that are used to retain digital [[data (computing)|data]]. It is a core function and fundamental component of computers.&lt;ref name="Patterson"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface |last=Patterson |first=David A. |last2=Hennessy |first2=John L. |date=2005 |publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann Publishers]] |isbn=1-55860-604-1 |edition=3rd |location=[[Amsterdam]] |oclc=56213091}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15–16}}

The [[central processing unit]] (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates data by performing computations.  In practice, almost all computers use a [[memory hierarchy|storage hierarchy]],&lt;ref name="Patterson" /&gt;{{rp|468–473}} which puts fast but expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and slower but larger and cheaper options farther away. Generally the fast volatile technologies (which lose data when off power) are referred to as "memory", while slower persistent technologies are referred to as "storage".

In the [[Von Neumann architecture]], the CPU consists of two main parts: The [[control unit]] and the [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU). The former controls the flow of data between the CPU and memory, while the latter performs arithmetic and [[Bitwise operations|logical operations]] on data.

== Functionality ==
Without a significant amount of memory, a computer would merely be able to perform fixed operations and immediately output the result. It would have to be reconfigured to change its behavior. This is acceptable for devices such as desk [[calculator]]s, [[digital signal processing|digital signal processors]], and other specialized devices. [[von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] machines differ in having a memory in which they store their operating [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]]s and data.&lt;ref name="Patterson" /&gt;{{rp|20}} Such computers are more versatile in that they do not need to have their hardware reconfigured for each new program, but can simply be [[computer programming|reprogrammed]] with new in-memory instructions; they also tend to be simpler to design, in that a relatively simple processor may keep [[program state|state]] between successive computations to build up complex procedural results. Most modern computers are von Neumann machines.

== Data organization and representation ==
A modern [[Computer|digital computer]] represents [[data]] using the [[binary numeral system]]. Text, numbers, pictures, audio, and nearly any other form of information can be converted into a string of [[bit]]s, or binary digits, each of which has a value of 1 or 0. The most common unit of storage is the [[byte]], equal to 8 bits. A piece of information can be handled by any computer or device whose storage space is large enough to accommodate ''the binary representation of the piece of information'', or simply [[data (computing)|data]]. For example, the [[complete works of Shakespeare]], about 1250 pages in print, can be stored in about five [[megabyte]]s (40 million bits) with one byte per character.

Data are [[Encoding|encoded]] by assigning a bit pattern to each [[Character (computing)|character]], [[Numerical digit|digit]], or [[multimedia]] object. Many standards exist for encoding (e.g., [[character encoding]]s like [[ASCII]], image encodings like [[JPEG]], video encodings like [[MPEG-4]]).

By adding bits to each encoded unit, redundancy allows the computer to both detect errors in coded data and correct them based on mathematical algorithms. Errors generally occur in low probabilities due to [[random]] bit value flipping, or "physical bit fatigue", loss of the physical bit in storage of its ability to maintain a distinguishable value (0 or 1), or due to errors in inter or intra-computer communication. A random [[RAM parity|bit flip]] (e.g., due to random [[radiation]]) is typically corrected upon detection. A bit, or a group of malfunctioning physical bits (not always the specific defective bit is known; group definition depends on specific storage device) is typically automatically fenced-out, taken out of use by the device, and replaced with another functioning equivalent group in the device, where the corrected bit values are restored (if possible). The [[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC) method is typically used in communications and storage for [[error detection and correction|error detection]].  A detected error is then retried.

[[Data compression]] methods allow in many cases (such as a database) to represent a string of bits by a shorter bit string ("compress") and reconstruct the original string ("decompress") when needed. This utilizes substantially less storage (tens of percents) for many types of data at the cost of more computation (compress and decompress when needed). Analysis of trade-off between storage cost saving and costs of related computations and possible delays in data availability is done before deciding whether to keep certain data compressed or not.

For [[data security|security reasons]] certain types of data (e.g., credit-card information) may be kept [[encryption|encrypted]] in storage to prevent the possibility of unauthorized information reconstruction from chunks of storage snapshots.

== Hierarchy of storage ==
{{Main article|Memory hierarchy}}
{{Contradicts other|date=March 2013|1=Memory hierarchy}}
[[File:Computer storage types.svg|thumb|right|350px|Various forms of storage, divided according to their distance from the [[central processing unit]]. The fundamental components of a general-purpose computer are [[arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic and logic unit]], [[control unit|control circuitry]], storage space, and [[input/output]] devices. Technology and capacity as in common [[home computer]]s around 2005.]]

Generally, the lower a storage is in the hierarchy, the lesser its [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and the greater its access [[latency (engineering)|latency]] is from the CPU. This traditional division of storage to primary, secondary, tertiary and off-line storage is also guided by cost per bit.

In contemporary usage, "memory" is usually [[semiconductor]] storage read-write [[random-access memory]], typically [[DRAM]] (dynamic RAM) or other forms of fast but temporary storage. "Storage" consists of storage devices and their media not directly accessible by the [[CPU]] ([[Secondary storage|secondary]] or [[tertiary storage]]), typically [[hard disk drive]]s, [[optical disc]] drives, and other devices slower than RAM but [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] (retaining contents when powered down).&lt;ref&gt;''Storage'' as defined in Microsoft Computing Dictionary, 4th Ed. (c)1999 or in The Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE Standard Terms, 7th Ed., (c) 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, ''memory'' has been called ''core memory'', ''main memory'', ''real storage'' or ''internal memory''. Meanwhile, non-volatile storage devices have been referred to as ''secondary storage'', ''external memory'' or ''auxiliary/peripheral storage''.

=== Primary storage ===
&lt;!-- Additional DIRECT links point to this section by its name. --&gt;
{{Main article|Computer memory}}

''Primary storage'' (also known as ''main memory'' or ''internal memory''), often referred to simply as ''memory'', is the only one directly accessible to the CPU. The CPU continuously reads instructions stored there and executes them as required. Any data actively operated on is also stored there in uniform manner.

Historically, [[History of computing hardware|early computers]] used [[delay line memory|delay lines]], [[Williams tube]]s, or rotating [[drum memory|magnetic drums]] as primary storage. By 1954, those unreliable methods were mostly replaced by [[magnetic core memory]]. Core memory remained dominant until the 1970s, when advances in [[integrated circuit]] technology allowed [[semiconductor memory]] to become economically competitive.&lt;!-- Please DO NOT EXPAND above text! Change but no expand any further. Anyone desiring to know more types, let it be [[twister memory]] or [[bubble memory]] etc, will click the History link. Do not confuse other readers. --&gt;

This led to modern [[random-access memory]] (RAM). It is small-sized, light, but quite expensive at the same time. (The particular types of RAM used for primary storage are also [[volatile memory|volatile]], i.e. they lose the information when not powered).

As shown in the diagram, traditionally there are two more sub-layers of the primary storage, besides main large-capacity RAM:

* [[Processor register]]s are located inside the processor. Each register typically holds a [[Word (computer architecture)|word]] of data (often 32 or 64 bits). CPU instructions instruct the [[arithmetic logic unit]] to perform various calculations or other operations on this data (or with the help of it). Registers are the fastest of all forms of computer data storage.
* [[CPU cache|Processor cache]] is an intermediate stage between ultra-fast registers and much slower main memory. It was introduced solely to improve the performance of computers. Most actively used information in the main memory is just duplicated in the cache memory, which is faster, but of much lesser capacity. On the other hand, main memory is much slower, but has a much greater storage capacity than processor registers. Multi-level [[Memory hierarchy|hierarchical cache]] setup is also commonly used—''primary cache'' being smallest, fastest and located inside the processor; ''secondary cache'' being somewhat larger and slower. &lt;!-- Please DO NOT EXPAND above text, especially with L1/L2/etc variants - reader can always click the link. --&gt;

Main memory is directly or indirectly connected to the central processing unit via a ''memory bus''. It is actually two buses (not on the diagram): an [[address bus]] and a [[Bus (computing)|data bus]]. The CPU firstly sends a number through an address bus, a number called [[memory address]], that indicates the desired location of data. Then it reads or writes the data in the [[Memory cell (computing)|memory cell]]s  using the data bus. Additionally, a [[memory management unit]] (MMU) is a small device between CPU and RAM recalculating the actual memory address, for example to provide an abstraction of [[virtual memory]] or other tasks.

As the RAM types used for primary storage are volatile (uninitialized at start up), a computer containing only such storage would not have a source to read instructions from, in order to start the computer. Hence, [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile primary storage]] containing a small startup program ([[BIOS]]) is used to [[Bootstrapping (computing)|bootstrap]] the computer, that is, to read a larger program from non-volatile ''secondary'' storage to RAM and start to execute it. A non-volatile technology used for this purpose is called ROM, for [[read-only memory]] (the terminology may be somewhat confusing as most ROM types are also capable of ''[[random access]]'').

Many types of "ROM" are not literally ''read only'', as updates to them are possible; however it is slow and memory must be erased in large portions before it can be re-written. Some [[embedded system]]s run programs directly from ROM (or similar), because such programs are rarely changed. Standard computers do not store non-rudimentary programs in ROM, and rather, use large capacities of secondary storage, which is non-volatile as well, and not as costly.

Recently, ''primary storage'' and ''secondary storage'' in some uses refer to what was historically called, respectively, ''secondary storage'' and ''tertiary storage''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/topics/0,295493,sid5_tax298620,00.html "Primary Storage or Storage Hardware" (shows usage of term "primary storage" meaning "hard disk storage")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910151628/http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/topics/0,295493,sid5_tax298620,00.html |date=10 September 2008 }}. Searchstorage.techtarget.com (2011-06-13). Retrieved on 2011-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secondary storage ===
&lt;!-- Note that additional DIRECT links point to this section by its name. --&gt;
[[File:35-Desktop-Hard-Drive.jpg|thumb|A [[hard disk drive]] with protective cover removed]]
{{Merge from|Auxiliary memory |discuss=Talk:Auxiliary memory#Merge to Secondary Storage|date=November 2017}}
{{Main article|Auxiliary memory}}

''Secondary storage'' (also known as ''external memory'' or ''auxiliary storage''), differs from primary storage in that it is not directly accessible by the CPU. The computer usually uses its [[input/output]] channels to access secondary storage and transfers the desired data using [[Data buffer|intermediate area]] in primary storage. Secondary storage does not lose the data when the device is powered down—it is non-volatile. Per unit, it is typically also two orders of magnitude less expensive than primary storage. Modern computer systems typically have two orders of magnitude more secondary storage than primary storage and data are kept for a longer time there.

In modern computers, [[hard disk drive]]s are usually used as secondary storage. The time taken to access a given byte of information stored on a hard disk is typically a few thousandths of a second, or milliseconds. By contrast, the time taken to access a given byte of information stored in random-access memory is measured in billionths of a second, or nanoseconds. This illustrates the  significant access-time difference which distinguishes solid-state memory from rotating magnetic storage devices: hard disks are typically about a million times slower than memory. Rotating [[Optical disc drive|optical storage]] devices, such as [[Compact Disc|CD]] and [[DVD]] drives, have even longer access times. With disk drives, once the disk read/write head reaches the proper placement and the data of interest rotates under it, subsequent data on the track are very fast to access. To reduce the seek time and rotational latency, data are transferred to and from disks in large contiguous blocks.

When data reside on disk, accessing them in large blocks to hide latency offers an opportunity to design efficient [[external memory algorithms]]. Sequential or block access on disks is orders of magnitude faster than random access, and many sophisticated paradigms have been developed to design efficient algorithms based upon sequential and block access. Another way to reduce the I/O bottleneck is to use multiple disks in parallel in order to increase the bandwidth between primary and secondary memory.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. S. Vitter]], ''[http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~jsv/Papers/Vit.IO_book.pdf Algorithms and Data Structures for External Memory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104233254/http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~jsv/Papers/Vit.IO_book.pdf |date=4 January 2011 }}'', Series on Foundations and Trends in Theoretical Computer Science, now Publishers, Hanover, MA, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-60198-106-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other examples of secondary storage technologies are [[flash memory]] (e.g. [[USB flash drive]]s or keys), [[floppy disk]]s, [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]], [[Punched tape|paper tape]], [[punched card]]s, standalone [[RAM disk]]s, and [[Iomega Zip drive]]s.

The secondary storage is often formatted according to a [[file system]] format, which provides the abstraction necessary to organize data into [[Computer file|files]] and [[Directory (computing)|directories]], providing also additional information (called [[metadata]]) describing the owner of a certain file, the access time, the access permissions, and other information.

Most computer [[operating system]]s use the concept of [[virtual memory]], allowing utilization of more primary storage capacity than is physically available in the system. As the primary memory fills up, the system moves the least-used chunks (''[[page (computing)|pages]]'') to secondary storage devices (to a [[Paging|swap file]] or [[paging|page file]]), retrieving them later when they are needed. As more of these retrievals from slower secondary storage are necessary, the more the overall system performance is degraded.

=== Tertiary storage ===

{{See also|Nearline storage|Cloud storage}}
[[File:StorageTek Powderhorn tape library.jpg|thumb|A large [[tape library]], with tape cartridges placed on shelves in the front, and a robotic arm moving in the back. Visible height of the library is about 180&amp;nbsp;cm.]]

''Tertiary storage'' or ''tertiary memory''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1994/CSD-94-847.pdf A thesis on Tertiary storage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927233543/http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1994/CSD-94-847.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }}. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt; provides a third level of storage. Typically, it involves a robotic mechanism which will ''mount'' (insert) and ''dismount'' removable mass storage media into a storage device according to the system's demands; such data are often copied to secondary storage before use. It is primarily used for archiving rarely accessed information since it is much slower than secondary storage (e.g. 5–60 seconds vs. 1–10 milliseconds). This is primarily useful for extraordinarily large data stores, accessed without human operators. Typical examples include [[tape library|tape libraries]] and [[optical jukebox]]es.

When a computer needs to read information from the tertiary storage, it will first consult a catalog [[database]] to determine which tape or disc contains the information. Next, the computer will instruct a [[industrial robot|robotic arm]] to fetch the medium and place it in a drive. When the computer has finished reading the information, the robotic arm will return the medium to its place in the library.

Tertiary storage is also known as ''[[nearline storage]]'' because it is "near to online". The formal distinction between online, nearline, and offline storage is:&lt;ref name="pearson2010"&gt;{{cite web |last=Pearson |first=Tony |year=2010 |url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/InsideSystemStorage/entry/the_correct_use_of_the_term_nearline2 |title=Correct use of the term Nearline. |work=IBM Developerworks, Inside System Storage |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Online storage is immediately available for I/O.
* Nearline storage is not immediately available, but can be made online quickly without human intervention.
* Offline storage is not immediately available, and requires some human intervention to become online.

For example, always-on spinning hard disk drives are online storage, while spinning drives that spin down automatically, such as in massive arrays of idle disks ([[MAID]]), are nearline storage. Removable media such as tape cartridges that can be automatically loaded, as in [[Tape library|tape libraries]], are nearline storage, while tape cartridges that must be manually loaded are offline storage.

=== Off-line storage ===
&lt;!-- Additional DIRECT links point to this section by name. --&gt;
''Off-line storage'' is a computer data storage on a medium or a device that is not under the control of a [[central processing unit|processing unit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}} See also article [[Federal Standard 1037C]].&lt;/ref&gt; The medium is recorded, usually in a secondary or tertiary storage device, and then physically removed or disconnected. It must be inserted or connected by a human operator before a computer can access it again. Unlike tertiary storage, it cannot be accessed without human interaction.

[[Online and offline|Off-line]] storage is used to [[Data transmission|transfer information]], since the detached medium can be easily physically transported. Additionally, in case a disaster, for example a fire, destroys the original data, a medium in a remote location will probably be unaffected, enabling [[disaster recovery]]. Off-line storage increases general [[information security]], since it is physically inaccessible from a computer, and data confidentiality or integrity cannot be affected by computer-based attack techniques. Also, if the information stored for archival purposes is rarely accessed, off-line storage is less expensive than tertiary storage.

In modern personal computers, most secondary and tertiary storage media are also used for off-line storage. Optical discs and flash memory devices are most popular, and to much lesser extent removable hard disk drives. In enterprise uses, magnetic tape is predominant. Older examples are floppy disks, Zip disks, or punched cards.

== Characteristics of storage ==
[[File:Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg|thumb|250px|A 1&amp;nbsp;GB module of [[SO-DIMM|laptop]] [[DDR2 SDRAM|DDR2]] [[Random-access memory|RAM]].]]

Storage technologies at all levels of the storage hierarchy can be differentiated by evaluating certain core characteristics as well as measuring characteristics specific to a particular implementation. These core characteristics are volatility, mutability, accessibility, and addressability. For any particular implementation of any storage technology, the characteristics worth measuring are capacity and performance.

=== Volatility ===
[[Non-volatile memory]] retains the stored information even if not constantly supplied with electric power.&lt;ref name="flashnvmWork"&gt;"[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277637285_A_Survey_of_Software_Techniques_for_Using_Non-Volatile_Memories_for_Storage_and_Main_Memory_Systems A Survey of Software Techniques for Using Non-Volatile Memories for Storage and Main Memory Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225040943/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277637285_A_Survey_of_Software_Techniques_for_Using_Non-Volatile_Memories_for_Storage_and_Main_Memory_Systems |date=25 December 2015 }}", IEEE TPDS, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; It is suitable for long-term storage of information. [[Volatile memory]] requires constant power to maintain the stored information. The fastest memory technologies are volatile ones, although that is not a universal rule. Since the primary storage is required to be very fast, it predominantly uses volatile memory.

[[Dynamic random-access memory]] is a form of volatile memory that also requires the stored information to be periodically reread and rewritten, or [[memory refresh|refreshed]], otherwise it would vanish. [[Static random-access memory]] is a form of volatile memory similar to DRAM with the exception that it never needs to be refreshed as long as power is applied; it loses its content when the power supply is lost.

An [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) can be used to give a computer a brief window of time to move information from primary volatile storage into non-volatile storage before the batteries are exhausted.  Some systems, for example [[EMC Symmetrix]], have integrated batteries that maintain volatile storage for several minutes.

=== Mutability ===
; Read/write storage or mutable storage : Allows information to be overwritten at any time. A computer without some amount of read/write storage for primary storage purposes would be useless for many tasks. Modern computers typically use read/write storage also for secondary storage.
; Read only storage : Retains the information stored at the time of manufacture, and ''write once storage'' ([[write once read many]]) allows the information to be written only once at some point after manufacture. These are called ''immutable storage''. Immutable storage is used for tertiary and off-line storage. Examples include [[CD-ROM]] and [[CD-R]].
; Slow write, fast read storage : Read/write storage which allows information to be overwritten multiple times, but with the write operation being much slower than the read operation. Examples include [[CD-RW]] and [[swayne memory]]

=== Accessibility ===
; [[Random access]]: Any location in storage can be accessed at any moment in approximately the same amount of time. Such characteristic is well suited for primary and secondary storage. Most semiconductor memories and disk drives provide random access.
; [[Sequential access]]: The accessing of pieces of information will be in a serial order, one after the other; therefore the time to access a particular piece of information depends upon which piece of information was last accessed. Such characteristic is typical of off-line storage.

=== Addressability ===
; Location-addressable : Each individually accessible unit of information in storage is selected with its numerical [[memory address]]. In modern computers, location-addressable storage usually limits to primary storage, accessed internally by computer programs, since location-addressability is very efficient, but burdensome for humans.
; [[file system|File addressable]]: Information is divided into ''[[computer file|files]]'' of variable length, and a particular file is selected with [[human-readable]] directory and file names. The underlying device is still location-addressable, but the [[operating system]] of a computer provides the file system [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] to make the operation more understandable. In modern computers, secondary, tertiary and off-line storage use file systems.
; [[content-addressable memory|Content-addressable]]: Each individually accessible unit of information is selected based on the basis of (part of) the contents stored there. Content-addressable storage can be implemented using [[software]] (computer program) or [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]] (computer device), with hardware being faster but more expensive option. Hardware content addressable memory is often used in a computer's [[CPU cache]].

=== Capacity ===
; Raw capacity : The total amount of stored information that a storage device or medium can hold. It is expressed as a quantity of [[bit]]s or [[byte]]s (e.g. 10.4 [[megabyte]]s).
; [[Memory storage density]]: The compactness of stored information. It is the storage capacity of a medium divided with a unit of length, area or volume (e.g. 1.2 megabytes per square inch).

=== Performance ===
; [[Latency (engineering)|Latency]]: The time it takes to access a particular location in storage. The relevant [[units of measurement|unit of measurement]] is typically [[1 E-9 s|nanosecond]] for primary storage, [[millisecond]] for secondary storage, and [[second]] for tertiary storage. It may make sense to separate read latency and write latency (especially for non-volatile memory&lt;ref name="flashnvmWork"/&gt;) and in case of sequential access storage, minimum, maximum and average latency.
; [[Throughput]]: The rate at which information can be read from or written to the storage. In computer data storage, throughput is usually expressed in terms of megabytes per second (MB/s), though [[bit rate]] may also be used. As with latency, read rate and write rate may need to be differentiated. Also accessing media sequentially, as opposed to randomly, typically yields maximum throughput.
; Granularity: The size of the largest "chunk" of data that can be efficiently accessed as a single unit, e.g. without introducing additional latency.
;Reliability: The probability of spontaneous bit value change under various conditions, or overall [[failure rate]].
Utilities such as [[hdparm]] and [[sar (Unix)|sar]] can be used to measure IO performance in Linux.

=== Energy use ===

== {{anchor|media}}Storage media ==
{{As of|2011}}, the most commonly used data storage media are semiconductor, magnetic, and optical, while paper still sees some limited usage. Some other fundamental storage technologies, such as all-flash arrays (AFAs) are proposed for development.

=== Semiconductor ===
[[Semiconductor memory]] uses [[semiconductor]]-based [[integrated circuit]]s to store information. A semiconductor memory chip may contain millions of tiny [[transistor]]s or [[capacitor]]s. Both ''volatile'' and ''non-volatile'' forms of semiconductor memory exist. In modern computers, primary storage almost exclusively consists of dynamic volatile semiconductor memory or [[dynamic random-access memory]]. Since the turn of the century, a type of non-volatile semiconductor memory known as [[flash memory]] has steadily gained share as off-line storage for home computers. Non-volatile semiconductor memory is also used for secondary storage in various advanced electronic devices and specialized computers that are designed for them.

As early as 2006, [[Laptop|notebook]] and [[desktop computer]] manufacturers started using flash-based [[solid-state drive]]s (SSDs) as default configuration options for the secondary storage either in addition to or instead of the more traditional HDD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1966644,00.asp New Samsung Notebook Replaces Hard Drive With Flash] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230081543/http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1966644,00.asp |date=30 December 2010 }}.

=== Magnetic ===
{{Magnetic storage media}}

[[Magnetic storage]] uses different patterns of [[magnetization]] on a [[magnetism|magnetically]] coated surface to store information. Magnetic storage is ''non-volatile''. The information is accessed using one or more read/write heads which may contain one or more recording transducers. A read/write head only covers a part of the surface so that the head or medium or both must be moved relative to another in order to access data. In modern computers, magnetic storage will take these forms:

* [[Disk storage|Magnetic disk]]
** [[Floppy disk]], used for off-line storage
** [[Hard disk drive]], used for secondary storage
* [[Magnetic tape data storage|Magnetic tape]], used for tertiary and off-line storage
* [[Carousel memory]] (magnetic rolls)

In early computers, magnetic storage was also used as:

* Primary storage in a form of [[Drum memory|magnetic memory]], or [[Magnetic core memory|core memory]], [[core rope memory]], [[thin-film memory]] and/or [[twistor memory]].
* Tertiary (e.g. [[NCR CRAM]]) or off line storage in the form of magnetic cards.
* Magnetic tape was then often used for secondary storage.

=== Optical ===
{{Optical storage media}}

[[Optical storage]], the typical [[optical disc]], stores information in deformities on the surface of a circular disc and reads this information by illuminating the surface with a [[laser diode]] and observing the reflection. Optical disc storage is ''non-volatile''. The deformities may be permanent (read only media), formed once (write once media) or reversible (recordable or read/write media). The following forms are currently in common use:&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html DVD FAQ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822172353/http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html |date=22 August 2009 }} is a comprehensive reference of DVD technologies.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Compact Disc|CD]], [[CD-ROM]], [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc|BD-ROM]]: Read only storage, used for mass distribution of digital information (music, video, computer programs)
* [[CD-R]], [[DVD-R]], [[DVD+R]], [[Blu-ray Disc recordable|BD-R]]: Write once storage, used for tertiary and off-line storage
* [[CD-RW]], [[DVD-RW]], [[DVD+RW]], [[DVD-RAM]], [[Blu-ray Disc recordable|BD-RE]]: Slow write, fast read storage, used for tertiary and off-line storage
* [[Ultra Density Optical]] or UDO is similar in capacity to [[Blu-ray Disc recordable|BD-R or BD-RE]] and is slow write, fast read storage used for tertiary and off-line storage.

[[Magneto-optical drive|Magneto-optical disc storage]] is optical disc storage where the magnetic state on a [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] surface stores information. The information is read optically and written by combining magnetic and optical methods. Magneto-optical disc storage is ''non-volatile'', ''sequential access'', slow write, fast read storage used for tertiary and off-line storage.

[[3D optical data storage]] has also been proposed.

Light induced magnetization melting in magnetic photoconductors has also been proposed for high-speed low-energy consumption magneto-optical storage.&lt;ref name="Náfrádi 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Náfrádi|first1=Bálint|title=Optically switched magnetism in photovoltaic perovskite CH3NH3(Mn:Pb)I3|journal=Nature Communications|date=24 November 2016|volume=7|page=13406|doi=10.1038/ncomms13406|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13406|pmc=5123013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128101114/http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13406|archivedate=28 November 2016|df=dmy-all|pmid=27882917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paper ===
{{Paper data storage media}}

[[Paper data storage]], typically in the form of [[punched tape|paper tape]] or [[punched card]]s, has long been used to store information for automatic processing, particularly before general-purpose computers existed. Information was recorded by punching holes into the paper or cardboard medium and was read mechanically (or later optically) to determine whether a particular location on the medium was solid or contained a hole.
A few technologies allow people to make marks on paper that are easily read by machine—these are widely used for tabulating votes and grading standardized tests. [[Barcode]]s made it possible for any object that was to be sold or transported to have some computer readable information securely attached to it.

=== Other storage media or substrates ===
; Vacuum tube memory: A [[Williams tube]] used a [[cathode ray tube]], and a [[Selectron tube]] used a large [[vacuum tube]] to store information. These primary storage devices were short-lived in the market, since the Williams tube was unreliable and the Selectron tube was expensive.

; Electro-acoustic memory: [[Delay line memory]] used [[Longitudinal wave|sound wave]]s in a substance such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]] to store information. Delay line memory was dynamic volatile, cycle sequential read/write storage, and was used for primary storage.

; [[Optical tape]]: is a medium for optical storage generally consisting of a long and narrow strip of plastic onto which patterns can be written and from which the patterns can be read back. It shares some technologies with cinema film stock and optical discs, but is compatible with neither. The motivation behind developing this technology was the possibility of far greater storage capacities than either magnetic tape or optical discs.

; [[Phase-change memory]]: uses different mechanical phases of [[phase-change material]] to store information in an X-Y addressable matrix, and reads the information by observing the varying [[electrical resistance]] of the material. Phase-change memory would be non-volatile, random-access read/write storage, and might be used for primary, secondary and off-line storage. Most rewritable and many write once optical disks already use phase change material to store information.

; [[Holographic data storage]]: stores information optically inside [[crystal]]s or [[photopolymer]]s. Holographic storage can utilize the whole volume of the storage medium, unlike optical disc storage which is limited to a small number of surface layers. Holographic storage would be non-volatile, sequential access, and either write once or read/write storage. It might be used for secondary and off-line storage. See [[Holographic Versatile Disc]] (HVD).

; [[Molecular memory]]: stores information in [[polymer]] that can store electric charge. Molecular memory might be especially suited for primary storage. The theoretical storage capacity of molecular memory is 10 terabits per square inch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090219141438.htm New Method Of Self-assembling Nanoscale Elements Could Transform Data Storage Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301235710/https://www.sciencedaily.com//releases//2009//02//090219141438.htm |date=1 March 2009 }}.

=== Redundancy ===
{{Main article|Disk mirroring|RAID}}
{{See also|Storage replication}}

While a group of bits malfunction may be resolved by error detection and correction mechanisms (see above), storage device malfunction requires different solutions. The following solutions are commonly used and valid for most storage devices:

* '''Device [[Disk mirroring|mirroring]] (replication)''' – A common solution to the problem is constantly maintaining an identical copy of device content on another device (typically of a same type). The downside is that this doubles the storage, and both devices (copies) need to be updated simultaneously with some overhead and possibly some delays. The upside is possible concurrent read of a same data group by two independent processes, which increases performance. When one of the replicated devices is detected to be defective, the other copy is still operational, and is being utilized to generate a new copy on another device (usually available operational in a pool of stand-by devices for this purpose).
* '''Redundant array of independent disks''' ('''[[RAID]]''') – This method generalizes the device mirroring above by allowing one device in a group of N devices to fail and be replaced with the content restored (Device mirroring is RAID with N=2). RAID groups of N=5 or N=6 are common. N&gt;2 saves storage, when comparing with N=2, at the cost of more processing during both regular operation (with often reduced performance) and defective device replacement.

Device mirroring and typical RAID are designed to handle a single device failure in the RAID group of devices. However, if a second failure occurs before the RAID group is completely repaired from the first failure, then data can be lost. The probability of a single failure is typically small. Thus the probability of two failures in a same RAID group in time proximity is much smaller (approximately the probability squared, i.e., multiplied by itself). If a database cannot tolerate even such smaller probability of data loss, then the RAID group itself is replicated (mirrored). In many cases such mirroring is done geographically remotely, in a different storage array, to handle also recovery from disasters (see disaster recovery above).

=== Network connectivity ===
A secondary or tertiary storage may connect to a computer utilizing [[computer network]]s. This concept does not pertain to the primary storage, which is shared between multiple processors to a lesser degree.

* [[Direct-attached storage]] (DAS) is a traditional mass storage, that does not use any network. This is still a most popular approach. This [[retronym]] was coined recently, together with NAS and SAN.
* [[Network-attached storage]] (NAS) is mass storage attached to a computer which another computer can access at file level over a [[local area network]], a private [[wide area network]], or in the case of [[File hosting service|online file storage]], over the [[Internet]]. NAS is commonly associated with the [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] and [[Server Message Block|CIFS/SMB]] protocols.
* [[Storage area network]] (SAN) is a specialized network, that provides other computers with storage capacity. The crucial difference between NAS and SAN, is that NAS presents and manages file systems to client computers, while SAN provides access at block-addressing (raw) level, leaving it to attaching systems to manage data or file systems within the provided capacity. SAN is commonly associated with [[Fibre Channel]] networks.

=== Robotic storage ===
Large quantities of individual magnetic tapes, and optical or magneto-optical discs may be stored in robotic tertiary storage devices. In tape storage field they are known as [[tape library|tape libraries]], and in optical storage field [[optical jukebox]]es, or optical disk libraries per analogy. Smallest forms of either technology containing just one drive device are referred to as [[autoloader (data storage device)|autoloaders]] or [[autochanger]]s.

Robotic-access storage devices may have a number of slots, each holding individual media, and usually one or more picking robots that traverse the slots and load media to built-in drives. The arrangement of the slots and picking devices affects performance. Important characteristics of such storage are possible expansion options: adding slots, modules, drives, robots. Tape libraries may have from 10 to more than 100,000 slots, and provide [[terabyte]]s or [[petabyte]]s of near-line information. Optical jukeboxes are somewhat smaller solutions, up to 1,000 slots.

Robotic storage is used for [[backup]]s, and for high-capacity archives in imaging, medical, and video industries. [[Hierarchical storage management]] is a most known archiving strategy of automatically ''migrating'' long-unused files from fast hard disk storage to libraries or jukeboxes. If the files are needed, they are ''retrieved'' back to disk.

'''Constructive journalism''' is an emerging domain within [[journalism]] that is slowly getting grounded within academia&lt;ref name="cg"&gt;Gyldensted, Cathrine [http://repository.upenn.edu/mapp_capstone/20/ "Innovating News Journalism through Positive Psychology"]. "University of Pennsylvania Scholarly Commons". 1 August 2011. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Alexander L. &amp; Hammonds, Keith H.

Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
and involves the field of communication that is based around reporting solution-focused news, instead of revolving only around negative and conflict-based stories. The idea behind constructive journalism is to give stories more context and make the consumer of the news more intelligent. By giving more background and also reporting what is going good, so that people are more able to create a realistic view of the world. Instead of only reporting the issues, with constructive journalism the journalist also addresses what the consumer can do with the information. What can I do to change it? etc. 

The journalist does not reflect his or her opinion and also does not render or implement what those solutions are, but tries to inform the society of what solutions there might be. Pioneers of constructive journalism say that as a journalist you have a big impact on the way people think, because of the way you construct the news. Journalists need to be aware of that responsibility more by being more careful in the way they construct their stories. They think that many journalist, who use a very cynical way of reporting the news, forget that by reporting everything that is going wrong from a distance, they also move the society.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;Gyldensted, Cathrine [https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/upworthy-media-role-climate-change-journalism/ "You will not believe what Upworthy can teach the media about sustainability"].

Therefore, instead of solely reporting on conflicts and problems, constructive journalism aims to gain a more comprehensive portrayal of the issues at hand.&lt;ref name=ca&gt;Albeanu, Catalina [https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/why-constructive-journalism-can-help-engage-the-audience/s2/a557706/ "Why constructive journalism can help engage the audience"].

"Nieman Foundation". 18 January 2014. Retrieved 21 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Constructive journalism aims express how change is possible and highlights the role each member of society may play to foster it. Additionally, it strives to strengthen the ethics code of journalism by avoiding the distortion of information in order to provide a more real portrayal of the world. Constructive Journalism attempts to create an engaging narrative that is factually correct without exaggerating numbers or realities.

== Applications ==

According to the Danish journalist [[Cathrine Gyldensted]], the Canadian [[Family therapy|family systems therapist]] [[Karl Tomm]]'s four types of therapeutic questioning can be adopted into an interview approach that can also be used by journalists.&lt;ref name="positivenews"&gt;Gyldensted, Cathrine. [http://positivenews.org.uk/2014/culture/media/16246/challenge-power-anew-family-therapy/ "How can we challenge power anew? Try family therapy"]. ''Positive News''. 12 September 2014. Retrieved 3 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Tomm's original framework provides four types of questions a therapist can use in [[psychotherapy]] sessions to bring about positive therapeutic outcomes from clients. By using the same model in journalism, similarly constructive answers could be obtained from the interviewee.

In what he named the "interventive interviewing" devised to facilitate positive changes in family dynamics, Tomm divides questions into four types based on two intersecting dimensions that make up four quadrants.&lt;ref name=tomm&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tomm |first=Karl |title=Interventive Interviewing: Part III. Intending to Ask Lineal, Circular, Strategic, or Reflexive Questions? |journal=Family Process |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |date=March 1988 |doi=10.1111/j.1545-5300.1988.00001.x |url=http://www.familytherapy.org/documents/Interventive3.PDF |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGiTJ-Z_y6Q Karl Tomm og de 4 spørgsmålstyper (Karl Tomm and the 4 types of question)]. ''YouTube.com''. Retrieved 2 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The first dimension of intentionality differentiates between "orienting questions" that help interviewers (therapists) orient their views about the interviewees (clients) and "influencing questions" that challenge the interviewees' (clients') understanding of themselves. When used outside psychotherapy, such as in journalism, this dimension of intentionality is also interpreted as the temporal dichotomy between past-orientation and future-orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Myllerup, Bent. [http://www.agile42.com/en/blog/2013/10/07/your-strategy-asking-powerful-questions/ "Your Strategy for Asking Powerful Questions"]. ''agile42''. 7 October 2013. Retrieved 2 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The second dimension of linear vs. circular assumptions, theoretically based on [[Gregory Bateson]]'s works on the nature of mind,&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, G. ''Steps to an ecology of mind''. New York: Ballantine Books, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, G. ''Mind and nature: A necessary unity''. New York: E.P. Dutton, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; differentiates between lineal assumptions that take a reductionist, deterministic approach and circular assumptions that take a holistic, systemic approach. The resulting four types of questions are:
# Linear Questions ("The Detective"): Basic investigative questions that deal with "Who did what?, Where?, When?, and Why?". This type of questions helps discover the factual aspect of the problem or issue.
# Circular Questions ("The Anthropologist"): This type of questions discovers relevant contextual perspective behind the facts. Examples: "How did this affect you (or other things/people/etc.)?" and "What is your explanation for A or B?".
# Reflexive Questions ("The Future Scientist"): In reflective questions, the interviewer suggests a new perspective on a given topic, thereby nudging the interviewee to reflect on a new possibility of constructive solutions to the problem or issue. Examples: "What do you think A believes, when he is in that situation?", "How would you approach this problem?", and "What action should be taken in order to do A or B?"
# Strategic Questions ("The Captain"): Directs the interviewee into commitment of the solution. Examples: "What should be done?", "Will you do it?", and "When will you do it?"

Gyldensted reports that conventional journalists tend to be past-oriented and hence leave out future-oriented questions, especially the "Future Scientist". &lt;ref name="cg" /&gt; For example, in a four-hour press conference with a former Danish prime minister, the press asked 59% "Detective", 19.4% "Captain", 18.7% "Anthropologist", and only 3% "Future Scientist" questions out of a total of more than 130 questions. "As a consequence," she writes, "[journalists] miss out on asking questions that explore new perspectives, solutions and visions, and on triggering actions based on those perspectives." An ideal, constructive interview requires a balance among all four types of questions, because "[a]n interview containing all four roles of questioning [...] reveals the problem and the involved parties (Detective), provides reflection on what has happened (Anthropologist), points towards a solution or maps a bigger vision (Future Scientist), and commits decision-makers (Captain)." These four types of questions, being grounded in family therapy, is especially effective in [[political journalism]], because the interviewer can encourage "mediation in political debates" and hence facilitate constructive collaboration among politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Gyldensted, Cathrine.

A '''''controversia''''' is an exercise in [[rhetoric]]; a form of [[declamation]] in which the student speaks for one side in a notional legal case such as treason or poisoning.  The facts of the matter and relevant law are presented in a persuasive manner, in the style of a legal counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |pages=500–501 |title=Handbook of Literary Rhetoric |author=Heinrich Lausberg, translated by David E.

'''Dada''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɑː|d|ɑː}}) or '''Dadaism''' was an [[art movement]] of the European [[avant-garde]] in the early 20th century, with early centers in Zürich, Switzerland, at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] (circa 1916); [[New York Dada]] began circa 1915,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=SF5QAAAAMAAJ Francis M. Naumann, ''New York Dada, 1915-23''], Abrams, 1994, {{ISBN|0810936763}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mario de Micheli (2006). ''Las vanguardias artísticas del siglo XX.'' Alianza Forma. p.135-137&lt;/ref&gt; and after 1920 Dada flourished in Paris.  Developed in reaction to [[World War I]], the Dada movement consisted of artists who rejected the [[logic]], [[reason]], and [[aestheticism]] of modern [[capitalist society]], instead expressing [[nonsense]], [[irrationality]], and [[anti-bourgeois]] protest in their works.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trachtman|first1=Paul|title=A Brief History of Dada|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/dada-115169154/|website=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneede"&gt;{{Citation | last=Schneede | first=Uwe M. | year=1979 | title=George Grosz, His life and work | location = New York | publisher = Universe Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd"&gt;Budd, Dona, ''The Language of Art Knowledge'', Pomegranate Communications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The art of the movement spanned visual, literary, and sound media, including [[collage]], [[sound poetry]], [[cut-up technique|cut-up writing]], and sculpture. Dadaist artists expressed their discontent with violence, war, and nationalism, and maintained political affinities with the [[Far-left politics|radical left]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/d/dada Dada, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dada1.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first edition of the publication ''Dada'' by [[Tristan Tzara]]; Zürich, 1917]]

There is no consensus on the origin of the movement's name; a common story is that the German artist [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] slid a [[paper knife]] (letter-opener) at random into a dictionary, where it landed on "dada", a colloquial French term for a [[Hobby horse (toy)|hobby horse]]. Others note that it suggests the first words of a child, evoking a childishness and absurdity that appealed to the group. Still others speculate that the word might have been chosen to evoke a similar meaning (or no meaning at all) in any language, reflecting the movement's internationalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/movement-dada.htm ''Dada''] at thearthistory.org, retrieved March 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of Dada lie in pre-war avant-garde. The term [[anti-art]], a precursor to Dada, was coined by [[Marcel Duchamp]] around 1913 to characterize works which challenge accepted definitions of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/anti-art Anti-art, Art that challenges the existing accepted definitions of art, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cubism]] and the development of [[collage]] and [[abstract art]] would inform the movement's detachment from the constraints of reality and convention. The work of French poets, Italian [[Futurism|Futurists]] and the [[Expressionism|German Expressionists]] would influence Dada's rejection of the tight correlation between words and meaning.&lt;ref name=oxfordart&gt;[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000021094?&amp;mediaType=Article "Dada"], by [[Dawn Adès]] and Matthew Gale, ''[[Grove Art Online]]'', Oxford University Press, 2009 {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Works such as ''[[Ubu Roi]]'' (1896) by [[Alfred Jarry]], and the ballet [[Parade (ballet)|''Parade'']] (1916–17) by [[Erik Satie]] would also be characterized as proto-Dadaist works.&lt;ref&gt;Roselee Goldberg, Thomas &amp; Hudson, ''L'univers de l'art'',  Chapter 4, ''Le surréalisme'', ''Les représentations pré-Dada à Paris'', {{ISBN|978-2-87811-380-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dada movement's principles were first collected in [[Hugo Ball]]'s [[wikisource:Dada Manifesto (1916, Hugo Ball)|Dada Manifesto]] in 1916.

The Dadaist movement included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publication of art/[[literary journals]]; passionate coverage of art, politics, and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media. Key figures in the movement included [[Hugo Ball]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Emmy Hennings]], [[Hans Arp]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Hannah Höch]], [[Johannes Baader]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Francis Picabia]], Huelsenbeck, [[George Grosz]], [[John Heartfield]], [[Man Ray]], [[Beatrice Wood]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Max Ernst]], and [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]] among others. The movement influenced later styles like the avant-garde and [[downtown music]] movements, and groups including [[Surrealism]], ''[[nouveau réalisme]]'', [[pop art]] and [[Fluxus]].

==Overview==
[[File:Francis Picabia, Dame! Illustration for the cover of the periodical Dadaphone n. 7, Paris, March 1920.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Picabia]], ''Dame!'' Illustration for the cover of the periodical ''Dadaphone'', n. 7, Paris, March 1920]]
Dada was an informal international movement, with participants in Europe and North America. The beginnings of Dada correspond to the outbreak of World War I. For many participants, the movement was a protest against the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[colonialism|colonialist]] interests, which many Dadaists believed were the root cause of the war, and against the cultural and intellectual conformity—in art and more broadly in society—that corresponded to the war.&lt;ref name=RichterAntiArt&gt;{{Citation | last=Richter | first=Hans | year=1965 | title=Dada: Art and Anti-art | location= New York and Toronto | publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avant-garde circles outside France knew of pre-war Parisian developments. They had seen (or participated in) Cubist exhibitions held at [[Galeries Dalmau]], Barcelona (1912), Galerie [[Der Sturm]] in Berlin (1912), the [[Armory Show]] in New York (1913), [[Mánes Union of Fine Arts|SVU Mánes]] in Prague (1914), several [[Jack of Diamonds (artists)|Jack of Diamonds]] exhibitions in Moscow and at De Moderne Kunstkring, Amsterdam (between 1911 and 1915). [[Futurism]] developed in response to the work of various artists. Dada subsequently combined these approaches.&lt;ref name=oxfordart /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sPGdBxzaWj0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA6&amp;lpg=RA1-PA6&amp;dq=%22Barcelona+and+developments+in+Zurich%22,+1916%E2%80%9320&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qbkgGKzLti&amp;sig=WSVSo0NVM_bSoiKAaOMb-e-ez_E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS_IGtzcHRAhUMaxQKHdWzBGwQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Barcelona%20and%20developments%20in%20Zurich%22%2C%201916%E2%80%9320&amp;f=false Joan M. Marter, ''The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Volume 1'', Oxford University Press, 2011], p. 6, {{ISBN|0195335791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Dadaists believed that the 'reason' and 'logic' of bourgeois [[capitalism|capitalist]] society had led people into war. They expressed their rejection of that ideology in artistic expression that appeared to reject logic and embrace [[Randomness|chaos]] and [[irrationality]].&lt;ref name="Schneede"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd"/&gt; For example, [[George Grosz]] later recalled that his Dadaist art was intended as a protest "against this world of mutual destruction."&lt;ref name="Schneede" /&gt;

According to [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]] Dada was not art: it was "[[anti-art]]."&lt;ref name=RichterAntiArt /&gt;  Dada represented the opposite of everything which art stood for. Where art was concerned with traditional [[aesthetics]], Dada ignored aesthetics. If art was to appeal to sensibilities, Dada was intended to offend.

As [[Hugo Ball]] expressed it, "For us, art is not an end in itself ... but it is an opportunity for the true perception and criticism of the times we live in."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=DADA: Cities | url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/cities/index.shtm | publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]] | accessdate=2008-10-19 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102003737/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/cities/index.shtm | archive-date=2008-11-02 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer from the ''[[ARTnews|American Art News]]'' stated at the time that "Dada philosophy is the sickest, most paralyzing and most destructive thing that has ever originated from the brain of man." Art historians have described Dada as being, in large part, a "reaction to what many of these artists saw as nothing more than an insane spectacle of collective homicide."&lt;ref name="gardners"&gt;{{Citation | author = Fred S. Kleiner | title = Gardner's Art Through the Ages | edition = 12th | year = 2006 | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | page = 754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, Dada artists described the movement as "a phenomenon bursting forth in the midst of the postwar economic and moral crisis, a savior, a monster, which would lay waste to everything in its path... [It was] a systematic work of destruction and demoralization... In the end it became nothing but an act of sacrilege."&lt;ref name="gardners"/&gt;

To quote Dona Budd's ''The Language of Art Knowledge'', &lt;blockquote&gt;Dada was born out of negative reaction to the horrors of the First World War. This international movement was begun by a group of artists and poets associated with the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] in Zürich. Dada rejected reason and logic, prizing nonsense, irrationality and intuition. The origin of the name Dada is unclear; some believe that it is a nonsensical word. Others maintain that it originates from the Romanian artists Tristan Tzara's and Marcel Janco's frequent use of the words "da, da," meaning "yes, yes" in the Romanian language. Another theory says that the name "Dada" came during a meeting of the group when a [[paper knife]] stuck into a French–German dictionary happened to point to 'dada', a French word for '[[Hobby horse (toy)|hobbyhorse]]'.&lt;ref name="Budd" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The movement primarily involved [[visual arts]], [[literature]], [[poetry]], [[art manifesto]]s, [[aesthetics|art theory]], [[theatre]], and [[graphic design]], and concentrated its [[anti-war]] politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in [[art]] through anti-art cultural works.

The creations of Duchamp, Picabia, Man Ray, and others between 1915 and 1917 eluded the term Dada at the time, and "[[New York Dada]]" came to be seen as a post facto invention of Duchamp. At the outset of the 1920s the term Dada flourished in Europe with the help of Duchamp and Picabia, who had both returned from New York. Notwithstanding, Dadaists such as Tzara and Richter claimed European precedence. Art historian David Hopkins notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ironically, though, Duchamp's late activities in New York, along with the machinations of Picabia, re-cast Dada's history. Dada's European chroniclers—primarily Richter, Tzara, and Huelsenbeck—would eventually become preoccupied with establishing the pre-eminence of Zurich and Berlin at the foundations of Dada, but it proved to be Duchamp who was most strategically brilliant in manipulating the genealogy of this avant-garde formation, deftly turning New York Dada from a late-comer into an originating force.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?isbn=1118476182 Hopkins, David, ''A Companion to Dada and Surrealism''], Volume 10 of Blackwell Companions to Art History, John Wiley &amp; Sons, May 2, 2016, p. 83, ISBN 11184761828&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

===Zürich===
[[File:Hoch-Cut With the Kitchen Knife.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hannah Höch]], ''Cut with the Dada Kitchen Knife through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany'', 1919, collage of pasted papers, 90×144&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Berlin State Museums|Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin]]]]
In 1916, [[Hugo Ball]], [[Emmy Hennings]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Marcel Janco]], [[Richard Huelsenbeck]], [[Sophie Taeuber]], and [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], along with others, discussed art and put on performances in the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] expressing their disgust with the war and the interests that inspired it.

Some sources state that Dada coalesced on October&amp;nbsp;6 at the Cabaret Voltaire. Other sources state that Dada did not originate fully in a Zürich literary salon but grew out of an already vibrant artistic tradition in Eastern Europe, particularly Romania, that transposed to Switzerland when a group of Jewish [[Modernism|modernist]] artists (Tzara, Janco, [[Arthur Segal (painter)|Arthur Segal]], and others) settled in Zürich. In the years prior to the First World War similar art had already risen in Bucharest and other Eastern European cities; it is likely that Dada's catalyst was the arrival in Zürich of artists like Tzara and Janco.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Sandqvist, ''DADA EAST: The Romanians of Cabaret Voltaire'', London MIT Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having left Germany and Romania during the Great War, the artists found themselves in Switzerland, a country recognized for its neutrality. Inside this space of political neutrality they decided to use abstraction to fight against the social, political, and cultural ideas of that time. The Dadaists believed those ideas to be a byproduct of bourgeois society, a society so apathetic it would rather fight a war against itself than challenge the ''[[status quo]]''.&lt;ref name="nga.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction: "Everybody can Dada"|url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/cities/index.shtm|publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]]|accessdate=10 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102003737/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/cities/index.shtm|archive-date=2 November 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janco recalled, "We had lost confidence in our culture. Everything had to be demolished. We would begin again after the ''[[tabula rasa]]''. At the Cabaret Voltaire we began by shocking common sense, public opinion, education, institutions, museums, good taste, in short, the whole prevailing order." &lt;ref&gt;Marcel Janco, "Dada at Two Speeds," trans. in Lucy R. Lippard, Dadas on Art (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1971), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cabaret closed its doors in early July and then at the first public [[soirée]] at Waag Hall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dada-companion.com/cabaret/ |title=Cabaret Voltaire |publisher=DADA Companion |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; on July 14, 1916, Ball recited the [[wikisource:Dada Manifesto (1916, Hugo Ball)|first manifesto]]. In 1917, Tzara wrote a second [[wikisource:Dada Manifesto|Dada manifesto]] considered one of the most important Dada writings, which was published in 1918. Other manifestos followed.

A single issue of the magazine ''Cabaret Voltaire'' was the first publication to come out of the movement.

After the cabaret closed down, Dada activities moved on to a new gallery, and [[Hugo Ball]] left for Bern. Tzara began a relentless campaign to spread Dada ideas. He bombarded French and Italian artists and writers with letters, and soon emerged as the Dada leader and master strategist. The Cabaret Voltaire re-opened, and is still in the same place at the Spiegelgasse 1 in the Niederdorf.

Zürich Dada, with Tzara at the helm, published the art and literature review ''Dada'' beginning in July 1917, with five editions from Zürich and the final two from Paris.

Other artists, such as [[André Breton]] and [[Philippe Soupault]], created “literature groups to help extend the influence of Dada.”&lt;ref&gt;Europe of Cultures. [http://fresques.ina.fr/europe-des-cultures-en/fiche-media/Europe00022/tristan-tzara-speaks-about-the-dada-movement.html "Tristan Tzara speaks of the Dada Movement."], September 6, 1963. Retrieved on July 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fighting of the First World War had ended in the armistice of November 1918, most of the Zürich Dadaists returned to their home countries, and some began Dada activities in other cities. Others, such as the Swiss native [[Sophie Taeuber]], would remain in Zürich into the 1920s.

===Berlin===
[[File:An Anna Blume.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Anna Blume, Dichtungen'', 1919]]
"Berlin was a city of tightened stomachers, of mounting, thundering hunger, where hidden rage was transformed into a boundless money lust, and men's minds were concentrating more and more on questions of naked existence... Fear was in everybody's bones "- Richard Hülsenbeck

The groups in Germany were not as strongly [[anti-art]] as other groups. Their activity and art were more political and social, with corrosive [[art manifesto|manifestos]] and propaganda, satire, public demonstrations and overt political activities. The intensely political and war-torn environment of Berlin had a dramatic impact on the ideas of Berlin Dadaists. Conversely, New York's geographic distance from the war spawned its more theoretically-driven, less political nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New York Dada|last = Naumann|first = Francis M.|publisher = Abrams|year = 1994|isbn = 0810936763|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1918, while the Great War was approaching its climax, Huelsenbeck gave his first Dada speech in Berlin, and he produced a Dada manifesto later in the year. Following the [[October Revolution]] in [[Russian Empire|Russia]], by then out of the war, [[Hannah Höch]] and [[George Grosz]] used Dada to express communist sympathies. Grosz, together with [[John Heartfield]], Höch and Hausmann developed the [[wikt:technique|technique]] of [[photomontage]] during this period.

After the war, the artists published a series of short-lived political magazines and held the ''First International Dada Fair'', 'the greatest project yet conceived by the Berlin Dadaists', in the summer of 1920.&lt;ref name="Dada, Dickermann p443"&gt;Dada, Dickermann, National Gallery of Art, Washington, 2006 p443&lt;/ref&gt; As well as work by the main members of Berlin Dada – Grosz, [[Raoul Hausmann]], Hannah Höch, [[Johannes Baader]], Huelsenbeck and Heartfield – the exhibition also included the work of [[Otto Dix]], [[Francis Picabia]], Jean Arp, [[Max Ernst]], [[Rudolf Schlichter]], [[Johannes Theodor Baargeld|Johannes Baargeld]] and others.&lt;ref name="Dada, Dickermann p443"/&gt; In all, over 200 works were exhibited, surrounded by incendiary slogans, some of which also ended up written on the walls of the Nazi's ''[[Entartete Kunst]]'' exhibition in 1937. Despite high ticket prices, the exhibition lost money, with only one recorded sale.&lt;ref&gt;Dada, Dickermann, National Gallery of Art, Washington, 2006 p99&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlin group published periodicals such as ''Club Dada'', ''Der Dada'', ''[[Jedermann sein eigner Fussball|Everyman His Own Football]]'', and ''Dada Almanach''.

===Cologne===
In [[Cologne]], Ernst, Baargeld, and Arp launched a controversial Dada exhibition in 1920 which focused on nonsense and anti-bourgeois sentiments. Cologne's Early Spring Exhibition was set up in a pub, and required that participants walk past urinals while being read lewd poetry by a woman in a [[Eucharist|communion]] dress. The police closed the exhibition on grounds of obscenity, but it was re-opened when the charges were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===New York===
{{main|New York Dada}}
Like Zürich, New York City was a refuge for writers and artists from the First World War. Soon after arriving from France in 1915, [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Francis Picabia]] met American artist [[Man Ray]]. By 1916 the three of them became the center of radical [[anti-art]] activities in the United States. American [[Beatrice Wood]], who had been studying in France, soon joined them, along with [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]]. [[Arthur Cravan]], fleeing conscription in France, was also in New York for a time. Much of their activity centered in [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s gallery, [[291 (art gallery)|291]], and the home of [[Walter Conrad Arensberg|Walter and Louise Arensberg]].

The New Yorkers, though not particularly organized, called their activities ''Dada,'' but they did not issue manifestos. They issued challenges to art and culture through publications such as ''[[The Blind Man]]'', ''Rongwrong'', and ''New York Dada'' in which they criticized the traditionalist basis for ''museum'' art. New York Dada lacked the disillusionment of European Dada and was instead driven by a sense of irony and humor. In his book ''Adventures in the arts: informal chapters on painters, vaudeville and poets'' [[Marsden Hartley]] included an essay on "[[s:The Importance of Being Dada|The Importance of Being 'Dada']]".

[[File:Label for the Belle Haleine cropped.png|thumb|upright|[[Rrose Sélavy]], the alter ego of Dadaist [[Marcel Duchamp]]]]
During this time Duchamp began exhibiting "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]]" (everyday objects found or purchased and declared art) such as a bottle rack, and was active in the [[Society of Independent Artists]]. In 1917 he submitted the now famous ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', a urinal signed R.&amp;nbsp;Mutt, to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition but they rejected the piece. First an object of scorn within the arts community, the ''Fountain'' has since become almost canonized by some&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/fountain-most-influential-piece-of-modern-art-673625.html, ''Fountain' most influential piece of modern art''], Independent, December 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the most recognizable modernist works of sculpture. Art world experts polled by the sponsors of the 2004 [[Turner Prize]], Gordon's gin, voted it "the most influential work of modern art".&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4059997.stm "Duchamp's urinal tops art survey"], [[BBC News]] December&amp;nbsp;1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; As recent scholarship documents, the work is still controversial. Duchamp indicated in a 1917 letter to his sister that a female friend was centrally involved in the conception of this work: "One of my female friends who had adopted the pseudonym Richard Mutt sent me a porcelain urinal as a sculpture."&lt;ref&gt;Duchamp, Marcel trans. and qtd. in [[Irene Gammel|Gammel, Irene]]. ''Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada and Everyday Modernity.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2002, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The piece is in line with the scatological aesthetics of Duchamp's neighbour, the [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven|Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]].&lt;ref&gt;Gammel, ''Baroness Elsa'', 224–225.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to "pay homage to the spirit of Dada" a performance artist named [[Pierre Pinoncelli]] made a crack in a replica of ''The Fountain'' with a hammer in January 2006; he also urinated on it in 1993.

Picabia's travels tied New York, Zürich and Paris groups together during the Dadaist period. For seven years he also published the Dada periodical ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]'' in Barcelona, New York City, Zürich, and Paris from 1917 through 1924.

By 1921, most of the original players moved to Paris where Dada had experienced its last major incarnation.

===Paris===
[[File:Man Ray, Rencontre dans la porte tournante.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Man Ray]], c. 1921–22, ''Rencontre dans la porte tournante'', published on the cover of ''[[Der Sturm]]'', Volume 13, Number 3, 5 March 1922]]
[[File:Man Ray, Dessin.jpg|thumb|upright|Man Ray, c. 1921–22, ''Dessin'' (''Drawing''), published on page 43 of ''Der Sturm'', Volume 13, Number 3, 5 March 1922]]
The French [[avant-garde]] kept abreast of Dada activities in Zürich with regular communications from [[Tristan Tzara]] (whose pseudonym means "sad in country," a name chosen to protest the treatment of Jews in his native Romania), who exchanged letters, poems, and magazines with [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[André Breton]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Clément Pansaers]], and other French writers, critics and artists.

Paris had arguably been the classical music capital of the world since the advent of musical Impressionism in the late 19th century. One of its practitioners, [[Erik Satie]], collaborated with [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and [[Jean Cocteau|Cocteau]] in a mad, scandalous ballet called ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]''. First performed by the [[Ballets Russes]] in 1917, it succeeded in creating a scandal but in a different way than Stravinsky's ''[[Le Sacre du printemps]]'' had done almost five years earlier. This was a ballet that was clearly parodying itself, something traditional ballet patrons would obviously have serious issues with.

Dada in Paris surged in 1920 when many of the originators converged there. Inspired by Tzara, Paris Dada soon issued manifestos, organized demonstrations, staged performances and produced a number of journals (the final two editions of ''Dada'', ''Le Cannibale'', and ''Littérature'' featured Dada in several editions.)&lt;ref&gt;Marc Dachy, {{lang|fr|Dada : La révolte de l'art}}, Paris, Gallimard / Centre Pompidou, collection "[[Découvertes Gallimard]]" (nº 476), 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first introduction of Dada artwork to the Parisian public was at the ''[[Salon des Indépendants]]'' in 1921. [[Jean Crotti]] exhibited works associated with Dada including a work entitled, ''Explicatif''  bearing the word ''Tabu''. In the same year Tzara staged his Dadaist play ''[[The Gas Heart]]'' to howls of derision from the audience. When it was re-staged in 1923 in a more professional production, the play provoked a theatre riot (initiated by [[André Breton]]) that heralded the split within the movement that was to produce [[Surrealism]]. Tzara's last attempt at a Dadaist drama was his "[[Irony|ironic]] [[tragedy]]" ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'' in 1924.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands the Dada movement centered mainly around [[Theo van Doesburg]], best known for establishing the [[De Stijl]] movement and magazine of the same name. Van Doesburg mainly focused on poetry, and included poems from many well-known Dada writers in ''De Stijl'' such as [[Hugo Ball]], [[Hans Arp]] and [[Kurt Schwitters]]. Van Doesburg and {{Interlanguage link multi|Thijs Rinsema|nl}} (a [[cordwainer]] and artist in [[Drachten]]) became friends of Schwitters, and together they organized the so-called ''Dutch Dada campaign'' in 1923, where van Doesburg promoted a leaflet about Dada (entitled ''What is Dada?''), Schwitters read his poems, [[Vilmos Huszár]] demonstrated a mechanical dancing doll and Nelly van Doesburg (Theo's wife), played [[avant-garde]] compositions on piano.

[[File:I.K. Bonset Voorbijtrekkende troep 2.jpg|thumb|A Bonset sound-poem, "Passing troop", 1916]]
Van Doesburg wrote Dada poetry himself in ''De Stijl'', although under a pseudonym, I.K.&amp;nbsp;Bonset, which was only revealed after his death in 1931. 'Together' with I.K.&amp;nbsp;Bonset, he also published a short-lived [[Dutch literature|Dutch]] Dada magazine called ''Mécano'' (1922–3). Another Dutchman identified by [[K. Schippers]] in his study of the movement in the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;''Holland Dada'', Amsterdam, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[Groningen]] typographer [[H. N. Werkman]], who was in touch with van Doesburg and Schwitters while editing his own magazine, ''The Next Call'' (1923–6). Two more artists mentioned by Schippers were German-born and eventually settled in the Netherlands. These were Otto van Rees, who had taken part in the liminal exhibitions at the Café Voltaire in Zürich, and [[Paul Citroen]].

===Georgia===
Although Dada itself was unknown in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] until at least 1920, from 1917 until 1921 a group of poets called themselves "41st Degree" (referring both to the latitude of [[Tbilisi]], Georgia and to the temperature of a high fever) organized  along Dadaist lines. The most important figure in this group was [[Ilia Zdanevich|Iliazd]], whose radical typographical designs visually echo the publications of the Dadaists. After his flight to Paris in 1921, he collaborated with Dadaists on publications and events.

===Yugoslavia===
In [[Yugoslavia]] there was significant Dada activity between 1920 and 1922, run mainly by [[Dragan Aleksić]] and including work by Mihailo S.&amp;nbsp;Petrov, [[Zenitism]]'s two brothers Ljubomir Micić and Branko Ve Poljanski.&lt;ref&gt;[https://monoskop.org/Zenit ''Zenit: International Review of Arts and Culture'']&lt;/ref&gt; Aleksić used the term "Yougo-Dada" and is known to have been in contact with [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], and [[Tristan Tzara]].&lt;ref&gt;Dubravka Djurić, Miško Šuvaković.

===Italy===
The Dada movement in Italy, based in [[Mantua]], was met with distaste and failed to make a significant impact in the world of art. It published a magazine for a short time and held an exhibition in Rome, featuring paintings, quotations from Tristan Tzara, and original epigrams such as "True Dada is against Dada". The most notable member of this group was [[Julius Evola]], who went on to become an eminent scholar of [[occultism]], as well as a right-wing philosopher and an assistant to [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/dada/dadas/evola.htm Julius Evola – International Dada Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[File:Dada in Ultraman.jpg|thumb|Dada, an iconic character from the Ultra Series. His design draws inspiration from the art movement.]]
A prominent Dada group in Japan was [[Mavo]], founded in July 1923 by [[Tomoyoshi Murayama]] and {{ill|Yanase Masamu|de||ja|柳瀬正夢}}. Other prominent artists were [[Jun Tsuji]], [[Eisuke Yoshiyuki]], [[Shinkichi Takahashi]] and [[Katsue Kitasono]].

In the [[Tsuburaya Productions]]'s ''[[Ultra Series]]'', an alien named Dada was designed after the Dadaism movement, with said character first appearing in episode 28 of the 1966 [[tokusatsu]] series, ''[[Ultraman]]'', and was designed by character artist [[Toru Narita]]. Dada's design is primarily monochromatic, and features numerous sharp lines and alternating black and white stripes, as a reference to the movement. On May 19, 2016, in celebration to the 100 year anniversary of Dadaism in Tokyo, the Ultra Monster was invited to meet the Swiss Ambassador Urs Bucher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m-78.jp/news/n-3812/|title=「三面怪人 ダダ」が「ダダイズム100周年」を祝福！スイス大使館で開催された記者発表会に登場！|publisher=m-78.jp|language=ja|date=2016-05-19|accessdate=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tokusatsunetwork.com/2016/05/dada-celebrates-dadaisms-birthday/|title=Dada Celebrates Dadaism’s 100th Anniversary|publisher=tokusatsunetwork.com|date=2016-05-19|accessdate=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Dada in itself was relatively unknown in Russia, however, avant-garde art was widespread due to the [[Bolshevik]]'s revolutionary agenda. The {{ill|Nichevoki|ru|Ничевоки}}, a literary group sharing Dadaist ideals achieved infamy after one of its members suggested that [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] should go to the "Pampushka" (Pameatnik Pushkina – [[Pushkinskaya Square|Pushkin monument]]) on the "Tverbul" ([[Tverskoy Boulevard]]) to clean the shoes of anyone who desired it, after Mayakovsky declared that he was going to cleanse Russian literature.

==Poetry, music and sound==
In literature, Dadaism focused mainly on poetry, particularly the so-called sound poetry, which was invented by [[Hugo Ball]] and often performed on stage. The Dadaist poem is described as one that abolishes the traditional concept of poetry, including the structure, order, as well as the interplay of sound and meaning or the meaning of language itself. The belief is that the existing system by which information is articulated is said to rob language of its dignity. 

[[File:Dadaglobe Form Letter to Vagts (Nov 1920).jpg|thumb|Dadaglobe solicitation form letter signed by Francis Picabia, Tristan Tzara, Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes, and Walter Serner, c. week of November 8, 1920. This example was sent from Paris to Alfred Vagts in Munich.]]

Therefore, the dismantling of the language and the poetic conventions are considered attempts to restore language to its purest and most innocent form. "With these sound poem, we wanted to dispense with a language which journalism had made desolate and impossible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dadaism|last=Elger|first=Dietmar|last2=Grosenick|first2=Uta|publisher=Taschen|year=2004|isbn=9783822829462|location=London|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the offshoots of this type of poetry was the simultaneous poems, which were recited by a group of speakers, who collectively produce a chaotic and confusing set of voices. The poems are considered manifestations of modern society such as advertising, technology, and conflict, among others. However, unlike movements such as expressionism, Dadaism appreciated the dynamics of modernity and the urban life. The poetry produced by this genre does not consider the chaotic urban and futuristic world as negative, man-eating or hellish. Instead, there is a focus on how these serve as new natural terrain that opens up new ideas for life and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Text Into Image, Image Into Text: Proceedings of the Interdisciplinary|last=Morrison|first=Jeffrey|last2=Krobb|first2=Florian|publisher=Rodopi|year=1997|isbn=9042001526|location=Atlanta|pages=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dadaism also blurred the line between the literary and visual arts. One of the Dadaist techniques, for instance, proposed the use of physical materials alongside words so that the newly created poem became a fruit of the written idea and the physical artifacts such as newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brazilian Literature as World Literature|last=Coutinho|first=Eduardo|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9781501323263|location=New York|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marc Lowenthal, in ''I Am a Beautiful Monster: Poetry, Prose, and Provocation'', writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Dada is the groundwork to abstract art and sound poetry, a starting point for performance art, a prelude to [[postmodernism]], an influence on [[pop art]], a celebration of antiart to be later embraced for anarcho-political uses in the 1960s and the movement that laid the foundation for [[Surrealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc Lowenthal, translator's introduction to [[Francis Picabia]]'s ''I Am a Beautiful Monster: Poetry, Prose, and Provocation''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dada was not confined to the visual and literary arts; its influence reached into sound and music. [[Kurt Schwitters]] developed what he called ''[[Sound poetry|sound poems]]'', while [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes]] composed Dada music performed at the Festival Dada in Paris on 26 May 1920. Other composers such as [[Erwin Schulhoff]], Hans Heusser and [[Alberto Savinio]] all wrote ''Dada music'', while members of [[Les Six]] collaborated with members of the Dada movement and had their works performed at Dada gatherings. [[Erik Satie]] also dabbled with Dadaist ideas during his career, although he is primarily associated with musical [[Impressionism]].

In the very first Dada publication, Hugo Ball describes a "balalaika orchestra playing delightful folk-songs." [[African music]] and jazz were common at Dada gatherings.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Musician [[Frank Zappa]] was a self-proclaimed Dadaist after learning of the movement:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the early days, I didn't even know what to call the stuff my life was made of. You can imagine my delight when I discovered that someone in a distant land had the same idea—AND a nice, short name for it.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Zappa, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:En hod dada museum.jpg|thumb|The [[Janco Dada Museum]], named after [[Marcel Janco]], in [[Ein Hod]], Israel]]
While broadly based, the movement was unstable. By 1924 in Paris, Dada was melding into Surrealism, and artists had gone on to other ideas and movements, including Surrealism, [[social realism]] and other forms of [[modernism]]. Some theorists argue that Dada was actually the beginning of [[postmodern art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Locher| first=David| title=Unacknowledged Roots and Blatant Imitation: Postmodernism and the Dada Movement| journal=Electronic Journal of Sociology| volume=4| issue=1| year=1999| url=http://www.sociology.org/content/vol004.001/locher.html| accessdate=2007-04-25| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223045916/http://www.sociology.org/content/vol004.001/locher.html| archive-date=2007-02-23| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the dawn of the [[World War II|Second World War]], many of the European Dadaists had emigrated to the United States. Some ([[Otto Freundlich]], [[Walter Serner]]) died in death camps under [[Adolf Hitler]], who actively persecuted the kind of "[[degenerate art]]" that he considered Dada to represent. The movement became less active as post-war optimism led to the development of new movements in art and literature.

Dada is a named influence and reference of various [[anti-art]] and political and cultural movements, including the [[Situationist International]] and [[culture jamming]] groups like the [[Cacophony Society]]. Upon breaking up in July 2012, [[anarchist]] pop band [[Chumbawamba]] issued a statement which compared their own legacy with that of the Dada art movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chumbawamba|url=http://www.chumba.com/|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time that the Zürich Dadaists were making noise and spectacle at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] was planning his revolutionary plans for Russia in a nearby apartment. [[Tom Stoppard]] used this coincidence as a premise for his play ''[[Travesties]]'' (1974), which includes Tzara, Lenin, and [[James Joyce]] as characters. French writer Dominique Noguez imagined Lenin as a member of the Dada group in his tongue-in-cheek ''Lénine Dada'' (1989).

The former building of the Cabaret Voltaire fell into disrepair until it was occupied from January to March 2002, by a group proclaiming themselves [[Neo-Dada]]ists, led by [[Mark Divo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2006/11/01/a-work-in-process.php 2002 occupation by neo-Dadaists] ''Prague Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The group included [[Leumund Cult|Jan Thieler]], [[Ingo Giezendanner]], Aiana Calugar, [[Lennie Lee]], and Dan Jones. After their eviction, the space was turned into a museum dedicated to the history of Dada. The work of Lee and Jones remained on the walls of the new museum.

Several notable [[retrospective]]s have examined the influence of Dada upon art and society. In 1967, a large Dada retrospective was held in Paris. In 2006, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City mounted a Dada exhibition in partnership with the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington D.C. and the [[Centre Pompidou]] in Paris. The [[LTM Recordings|LTM]] label has released a large number of Dada-related sound recordings, including interviews with artists such as Tzara, Picabia, Schwitters, Arp, and Huelsenbeck, and musical repertoire including Satie, Ribemont-Dessaignes, Picabia, and Nelly van Doesburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ltmrecordings.com/fdrcat.html LTM Recordings]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art techniques developed==

===Collage===
The Dadaists imitated the techniques developed during the cubist movement through the pasting of cut pieces of paper items, but extended their art to encompass items such as transportation tickets, maps, plastic wrappers, etc. to portray aspects of life, rather than representing objects viewed as still life.

===Cut-up technique===
[[Cut-up technique]] is an extension of collage to words themselves, [[Tristan Tzara]] describes this in the Dada Manifesto:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.391.org/manifestos/19201212tristantzara_dmonflabl.htm |title=manifestos: dada manifesto on feeble love and bitter love by tristan tzara, 12th december 1920 |publisher=391 |date=1920-12-12 |accessdate=2011-06-27}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;
TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM
Take a newspaper.
Take some scissors.
Choose from this paper an article of the length you want to make your poem.
Cut out the article.
Next carefully cut out each of the words that makes up this article and put them all in a bag.
Shake gently.
Next take out each cutting one after the other.
Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag.
The poem will resemble you.
And there you are – an infinitely original author of charming sensibility, even though unappreciated by the vulgar herd.
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Photomontage===
[[File:ABCD-Hausmann.jpg|thumb|upright|Raoul Hausmann, ''ABCD'' (self-portrait), a photomontage from 1923–24]]
The Dadaists – the "monteurs" (mechanics) – used scissors and glue rather than paintbrushes and paints to express their views of modern life through images presented by the media. A variation on the collage technique, photomontage utilized actual or reproductions of real photographs printed in the press. In Cologne, [[Max Ernst]] used images from the First World War to illustrate messages of the destruction of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/techniques/index.shtm |title=DADA – Techniques – photomontage |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MechanicalHead-Hausmann.jpg|thumb|upright|Raoul Hausmann, ''Mechanischer Kopf (Der Geist unserer Zeit)'' (Mechanical Head [The Spirit of Our Age]), c. 1920]]

===Assemblage===
The [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]]s were three-dimensional variations of the collage – the assembly of everyday objects to produce meaningful or meaningless (relative to the war) pieces of work including war objects and trash. Objects were nailed, screwed or fastened together in different fashions.  Assemblages could be seen in the round or could be hung on a wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/techniques/assemblage.shtm |title=DADA – Techniques – assemblage |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Readymades===
[[Marcel Duchamp]] began to view the manufactured objects of his collection as objects of art, which he called "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]]". He would add signatures and titles to some, converting them into artwork that he called "readymade aided" or "rectified readymades". Duchamp wrote: "One important characteristic was the short sentence which I occasionally inscribed on the 'readymade.' That sentence, instead of describing the object like a title, was meant to carry the mind of the spectator towards other regions more verbal. Sometimes I would add a graphic detail of presentation which in order to satisfy my craving for alliterations, would be called 'readymade aided.'"&lt;ref&gt;"The Writings of Marcel Duchamp" {{ISBN|0-306-80341-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example of Duchamp's readymade works is the urinal that was turned onto its back, signed "R. Mutt", titled ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', and submitted to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition that year, though it was not displayed.

'''Data-centric security''' is an approach to security that emphasizes the security of the [[data]] itself rather than the security of [[Computer network|networks]], [[Server (computing)|servers]], or applications. Data-centric security is evolving rapidly as enterprises increasingly rely on digital information to [[business process|run their business]] and [[big data]] projects become mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Data-centric security also allows organizations to overcome the disconnect between IT security technology and the objectives of business strategy by relating security services directly to the data they implicitly protect; a relationship that is often obscured by the presentation of security as an end in itself.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key concepts ==
Common processes in a data-centric security model include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Discover: the ability to know what data is stored where including sensitive information.
* Manage: the ability to define access policies that will determine if certain data is accessible, editable, or blocked from specific users, or locations.
* Protect: the ability to defend against data loss or unauthorized use of data and prevent sensitive data from being sent to unauthorized users or locations.
* Monitor: the constant monitoring of data usage to identify meaningful deviations from normal behavior that would point to possible malicious intent.

From a technical point of view, information(data)-centric security relies on the implementation of the following:&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* Information (data) that is self-describing and defending.
* Policies and controls that account for business context.
* Information that remains protected as it moves in and out of applications and storage systems, and changing business context.
* Policies that work consistently through the different data management technologies and defensive layers implemented.

== Technology ==

===Data access controls and policies=== 
Data [[access control]] is the selective restriction of access to data. Accessing may mean viewing, editing, or using. Defining proper access controls requires to map out the information, where it resides, how important it is, who it is important to, how sensitive the data is and then designing appropriate controls.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Encryption===
{{main|Encryption}}
Encryption is a proven data-centric technique to address the risk of data theft in smartphones, laptops, desktops and even servers, including the cloud. One limitation is that encryption is not always effective once a network intrusion has occurred and cybercriminals operate with stolen valid user credentials.&lt;ref&gt;  Encryption solutions with multi-factor authentication are much more effective in preventing such access.

 | date = 2015
 | url = http://www.technologyreview.com/view/535111/encryption-wouldnt-have-stopped-anthems-data-breach/
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data masking===
{{main|Data masking}}
Data Masking is the process of hiding specific data within a database table or cell to ensure that data security is maintained and that sensitive information is not exposed to unauthorized personnel. This may include masking the data from users, developers, third-party and outsourcing vendors, etc.
Data masking can be achieved multiple ways: by duplicating data to eliminate the subset of the data that needs to be hidden, or by obscuring the data dynamically as users perform requests.
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 | last = IRI
 | title = Dynamic Data Masking Software
 | date = 2017
 | url = http://www.iri.com/solutions/data-masking/dynamic-data-masking
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Auditing===
{{main|Security audit}}
Monitoring all activity at the data layer is a key component of a data-centric security strategy. It provides visibility into the types of actions that users and tools have requested and been authorized to on specific data elements. Continuous monitoring at the data layer combined with precise access control can contribute significantly to the real-time detection of data breaches, limits the damages inflicted by a breach and can even stop the intrusion if proper controls are in place. A 2016 survey&lt;ref&gt;
 {{cite web

 | url = http://www.darkreading.com/application-security/database-security/databases-remain-soft-underbelly-of-cybersecurity/d/d-id/1325216
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
shows that most organizations still don't assess database activity continuously and lack the capability to identify database breaches in a timely fashion.

== Cloud computing  ==
[[Cloud computing]] is an evolving paradigm with tremendous momentum, but its unique aspects exacerbate security and privacy challenges. Heterogeneity and diversity of cloud services and environments demand fine-grained access control policies and services that should be flexible enough to capture dynamic, context, or attribute-based access requirements and data protection.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 | last =  IEEE 
 | title = Security and Privacy Challenges in Cloud Computing Environments
 | date = 2010
 | url = http://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/SE765/Paper/security2.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data-centric security in the public cloud environments=== 
In recent decades many organizations rely on managing database services in public clouds such [[Amazon Web Services]], [[Oracle Cloud]], [[Google Cloud Platform]] or [[Microsoft Azure]] to organize their data.
Such approach has its own limitations on what users can do with managing security of their sensitive data. For instance, hardware security appliances or agents running on the database servers are no longer an option. This requires innovative ways to secure data and databases such as using reverse proxy sitting between clients / applications and database servers. The requirements such supporting a load balancing, high availability and fail-over in data-centric security brings additional challenges that database security vendors must meet. &lt;ref&gt;

'''Earthquake-resistant structures''' are [[structure]]s designed to protect buildings from  [[earthquake]]s. While no structure can be entirely immune to damage from earthquakes, the goal of [[Earthquake engineering|earthquake-resistant construction]] is to erect structures that fare better during seismic activity than their conventional counterparts.
According to [[building code]]s, earthquake-resistant structures are intended to withstand the largest earthquake of a certain probability that is likely to occur at their location.This means the loss of life should be minimized by preventing collapse of the buildings for rare earthquakes while the loss of the functionality should be limited for more frequent ones.&lt;ref name=RecommendedLateralForce&gt;{{cite book|title= Recommended Lateral Force Requirements and Commentary|author=Seismology Committee|year=1999|publisher= Structural Engineers Association of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat earthquake destruction, the only method available to ancient architects was to build their landmark structures to last, often by making them excessively [[stiffness|stiff]] and [[strength of materials|strong]].

Currently, there are several design philosophies in earthquake engineering, making use of experimental results, computer simulations and observations from past earthquakes to offer the required performance for the seismic threat at the site of interest. These range from appropriately sizing the structure to be [[strength of materials|strong]] and [[ductility|ductile]] enough to survive the shaking with an acceptable damage, to equipping it with [[base isolation]] or using structural [[vibration control]] technologies to minimize any forces and deformations. While the former is the method typically applied in most earthquake-resistant structures, important facilities, landmarks and cultural heritage buildings use the more advanced (and expensive) techniques of isolation or control to survive strong shaking with minimal damage. Examples of such applications are the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels]] and the [[Acropolis Museum]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Trends and projects ==
Some of the new trends and/or projects in the field of earthquake engineering structures are presented.

===Building materials===
Based on studies in New Zealand, relating to [[Christchurch]] earthquakes, precast concrete designed and installed in accordance with modern codes performed well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.precastnz.org.nz/precast-concrete-and-seismic-issues/#damage Precast New Zealand Inc: Precast concrete and seismic issues]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[Earthquake Engineering Research Institute]], precast panel buildings had good durability during the earthquake in Armenia, compared to precast frame-panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eeri.org/1988/12/spitak/armenia_spitak_concrete/|title=Precast concrete panel building damage, comparing the performance of precast frame-panel (collapsed in foreground) and precast panel buildings (standing in background)|website=www.eeri.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earthquake shelter===
One Japanese construction company has developed a six-foot cubical shelter, presented as an alternative to earthquake-proofing an entire building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4965895.html|title=Earthquake shelter with bed support and canopy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concurrent shake-table testing ===
Concurrent shake-table testing of two or more building models is a vivid, persuasive and effective way to validate [[earthquake engineering]] solutions experimentally.

Thus, two wooden houses built before adoption of the 1981 Japanese Building Code were moved to E-Defense&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allamericanpatriots.com/node/12697 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927091751/http://www.allamericanpatriots.com/node/12697 |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for testing (see both pictures aside). The left house was reinforced to enhance its seismic resistance, while the other one was not. These two models were set on E-Defense platform and tested simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc652Zp5qWk&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=182|title=Shaking Table Test on Conventional Wooden House (1)|last=neesit|date=17 November 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combined vibration control solution===
[[File:Municipal Services Building-1.jpg|thumb|left|Close-up of abutment of [[w:en:Seismic retrofit|seismically retrofitted]] Municipal Services Building in [[Glendale, California]]]][[File:Municipal Services Building.jpg|thumb|[[w:en:Seismic retrofit|Seismically retrofitted]] Municipal Services Building in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]]]]Designed by architect Merrill W. Baird of Glendale, working in collaboration with [[Albert C. Martin, Sr.|A. C. Martin]] Architects of Los Angeles, the Municipal Services Building at 633 East Broadway, [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] was completed in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.glendale.ca.us/planning/MSB+EIR/AppendixB.pdf|title=Planning Division - City of Glendale, CA|website=www.ci.glendale.ca.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominently sited at the corner of East Broadway and Glendale Avenue, this civic building serves as a heraldic element of Glendale's civic center.

In October 2004 [[Architectural Resources Group]] (ARG) was contracted by [[Nabih Youssef]] &amp; Associates, Structural Engineers, to provide services regarding a historic resource assessment of the building due to a proposed seismic retrofit.

In 2008, the Municipal Services Building of the City of Glendale, California was [[w:en:seismic retrofit|seismically retrofitted]] using an innovative combined vibration control solution: the existing [[v:Elevated building foundation|elevated building foundation]] of the building was put on [[w:en:base isolation|high damping rubber bearings]].

===Steel plate walls system===
[[File:Pages from Kharrazi 0002.jpg|thumb|left|Coupled steel plate shear walls, [[Seattle]]]][[File:LA LiveTower05.jpg|thumb|The [[Ritz-Carlton]]/[[JW Marriott]] hotel building engaging the advanced steel plate shear walls system, [[Los Angeles]]]]A [[steel plate shear wall]] (SPSW) consists of steel infill plates bounded by a column-beam system. When such infill plates occupy each level within a framed bay of a structure, they constitute a SPSW system.&lt;ref&gt;Kharrazi, M.H.K., 2005, "Rational Method for Analysis and Design of Steel Plate Walls," Ph.D. Dissertation, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada,&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas most earthquake resistant construction methods are adapted from older systems, SPSW was invented entirely to withstand seismic activity.&lt;ref name=Reitherman&gt;{{cite book|last=Reitherman|first=Robert|title=Earthquakes and Engineers: An International History|year=2012|publisher=ASCE Press|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784410714|pages=356–357|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726183407/http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877|archivedate=2012-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SPSW behavior is analogous to a vertical [[Plate (metal)|plate]] [[girder]] cantilevered from its base.  Similar to plate girders, the SPSW system optimizes component performance by taking advantage of the post-[[buckling]] behavior of the steel infill panels.

The Ritz-Carlton/JW Marriott hotel building, a part of the [[LA Live]] development in [[Los Angeles, California]], is the first building in Los Angeles that uses an advanced steel plate shear wall system to resist the lateral loads of strong earthquakes and winds.

===Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant is partially upgraded ===
The  [[Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant]], the largest nuclear generating station in the world by net [[electrical power]] rating, happened to be near the epicenter of the strongest [[moment magnitude scale|M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;]] 6.6 [[2007 Chūetsu offshore earthquake|July 2007 Chūetsu offshore earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/corporate/Profits_shaken_at_Tepco_310707.shtml |title=Profits shaken at Tepco |date=31 July 2007 |publisher=''World Nuclear News'' |accessdate=2007-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224605/http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/corporate/Profits_shaken_at_Tepco_310707.shtml |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This  initiated an extended shutdown for structural inspection which indicated that a greater earthquake-proofing was needed before operation could be resumed.&lt;ref&gt;Asahi.com. [http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200707180144.html Quake exposes nuke-plant danger]. July 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2009, one unit (Unit 7) was restarted, after the [[seismic retrofit|seismic upgrades]]. The test run had to continue for 50 days. The plant had been completely shut down for almost 22 months following the earthquake.

===Seismic test of seven-story building===
A destructive earthquake struck a lone, wooden condominium in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.rpi.edu/update.do|title=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute News &amp; Events|date=12 October 2007|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012030742/http://news.rpi.edu/update.do|archivedate=12 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment was webcast live on July 14, 2009 to yield insight on how to make wooden structures stronger and better able to withstand major earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/newsmedia/neeswood|title=Home - Standing Strong: 2009 NEESWood Capstone Test|website=www.nsf.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Miki, Hyōgo|Miki]] shake at the Hyogo Earthquake Engineering Research Center is the capstone experiment of the four-year NEESWood project, which receives its primary support from the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]] Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Program.

"NEESWood aims to develop a new seismic design philosophy that will provide the necessary mechanisms to safely increase the height of wood-frame structures in active seismic zones of the United States, as well as mitigate earthquake damage to low-rise wood-frame structures," said Rosowsky, Department of Civil Engineering at [[Texas A&amp;M University]]. This philosophy is based on the application of seismic damping systems for wooden buildings. The systems, which can be installed inside the walls of most wooden buildings, include strong metal [[:wikt:Frame|frame]], [[Timber framing|bracing]] and [[Tuned mass damper|damper]]s filled with [[viscous]] fluid.

===Superframe earthquake proof structure===
The proposed system is composed of core walls, hat beams incorporated into the top level,  outer columns and viscous dampers vertically installed between the tips of the hat beams and the outer columns. During an earthquake, the hat beams and outer columns act as outriggers and reduce the overturning moment in the core, and the installed dampers also reduce the moment and the lateral deflection of the structure. This innovative system can eliminate inner beams and inner columns on each floor, and thereby provide buildings  with  column-free  floor  space  even  in  highly  seismic  regions.&lt;ref&gt;"A Survey on concepts of design and executing of Superframe RC Earthquake proof Structures" (2016) by Kiarash Khodabakhshi {{ISBN|9783668208704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/nicee/wcee/article/0744.pdf | title=Seismic Design of a Super Frame | publisher=Kajima Corporation | accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13593">'''Engaged theory''' is a methodological framework for understanding [[social complexity]]. It takes social life or [[social relations]] as its base category, with 'the social' always understood as grounded in 'the natural', including humans as embodied beings. Engaged theory provides a framework that moves from detailed empirical analysis about things, people and processes in the world&lt;ref&gt;See for example the engaged research associated with Circles of Sustainability. [http://www.CirclesofSustainability.org www.CirclesofSustainability.org]&lt;/ref&gt; to abstract theory about the constitution and social framing of those things, people and processes.&lt;ref&gt;See Paul James, ''Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In'', Sage Publications, London, 2006 [https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Engaged theory is one approach within the broader tradition of [[critical theory]]. Engaged theory crosses the fields of [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[political studies]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], and [[global studies]]. At its most general, the term ''engaged theory'' is used to describe theories that provide a tool box for engaging with the world while seeking to change it.&lt;ref&gt;James Clifford, 'On Ethnographic Authority', Representations, vol. 1, no. 2, 1983, pp. 118–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

One lineage of engaged theory is called the 'constitutive abstraction' approach associated with a group of writers publishing in [[Arena (Australian publishing co-operative)|''Arena Journal'']] such as John Hinkson, Geoff Sharp (1926–2015), and Simon Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;For a book that uses this approach see Simon Cooper, ''Techno-Culture and Critical Theory'', Routledge, London, 2002. One of the most important early pieces of writing in this approach was Geoff Sharp, 'Constitutive Abstraction and Social Practice', ''Arena'', 70, 1985, pp. 48–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related lineage of engaged theory has been developed by researchers who began their association through the Centre for Global Research at [[RMIT University|Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]] in Australia – scholars such as [[Manfred Steger]], [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] and Damian Grenfell – drawing upon a range of writers from [[Pierre Bourdieu]] to [[Benedict Anderson]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. A group of researchers at Western Sydney University describe their work as 'Engaged Research'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uws.edu.au/ics/about | title=About ICS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The politics of engagement==

For all of its concern for epistemological grounding (see below), Engaged theory is an approach that is 'in the world'. All theory in some way affects what happens in the world, but it does not always theorize its own place in the constitution of ideas and practices. [[Anthony Giddens]] calls this movement a [[double hermeneutic]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Giddens (1987), ''Social Theory and Modern Sociology'', Cambridge, Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Engaged theory is more explicit than most about its political standpoint. [[Carol J. Adams]] expresses one dimension of this when she writes: 
{{cquote| It is engaged theory, theory that arises from anger about what is, theory that envisions what is possible. Engaged theory makes change possible.&lt;ref&gt;Carol J. Adams in ''Species Matters: Human Advocacy and Cultural Theory'', New York, Columbia University Press, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
However, the other important dimension is that any theory needs to be aware of its own tendencies to be ideologically driven by dominant concerns of its day. [[Liberalism]], for example, with its reductive advocacy of the ideology of 'freedom', fails to be reflexive about this dimension. Similarly, critical theory sometimes fails to be reflexive of what it means to be critical or advocate social change.

== The grounding of analysis ==
All social theories are dependent upon a process of [[abstraction]].&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hartle (1997), ''Self-knowledge in the Age of Theory'', Lanham Rowman and Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; This is what philosophers call [[Epistemology|epistemological]] abstraction. However, they do not characteristically theorize their own bases for establishing their standpoint. Engaged theory does. By comparison, [[Grounded theory]], a very different approach, suggests that empirical data collection is a neutral process that gives rise to theoretical claims out of that data. Engaged theory, to the contrary, treats such a claim to ''value neutrality'' as naively unsustainable. Engaged theory is thus reflexive in a number of ways: 
* Firstly, it recognises that doing something as basic as collecting data already entails making theoretical presuppositions. 
* Secondly, it names the levels of analysis from which theoretical claims are made. Engaged theory works across four levels of theoretical abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= James | first= Paul |authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214 | year= 2006 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See below: ''Modes of Analysis''.) 
* Thirdly, it makes a clear distinction between theory and method, suggesting that a social theory is an argument about a social phenomenon, while an analytical method or set of methods is defined a means of substantiating that theory. Engaged theory in these terms works as a 'Grand method', but not a '[[Grand theory]]'. It provides an integrated set of methodological tools for developing different theories of things and processes in the world.
* Fourthly, it seeks to understand both its own epistemological basis, while treating knowledge formation as one of the basic [[ontology|ontological]] categories of human practice.&lt;ref&gt;Gunter Abel and James Conant, eds (2012) ''Rethinking Epistemology'', Berlin, De Gruyter&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fifthly, it treats ''history'' as a ''modern'' way of understanding temporal change; and therefore different ontologically from a tribal [[saga]] or cosmological [[narrative]]. In other words, it provides meta-standpoint on its own capacity to historicize.

==The modes of analysis==
In the version of Engaged theory developed by an Australian-based group of writers, analysis moves from the most concrete form of analysis – empirical generalization – to more abstract modes of analysis. Each subsequent mode of analysis is more abstract than the previous one moving across the following themes: 1. doing, 2. acting, 3. relating, 4. being.

This leads to the 'levels' approach as set out below:

===1. Empirical analysis (ways of doing)===
The method begins by emphasizing the importance of a first-order abstraction, here called ''empirical analysis''. It entails drawing out and generalizing from on-the-ground detailed descriptions of history and place. This first level either involves generating empirical description based on observation, experience, recording or experiment—in other words, abstracting evidence from that which exists or occurs in the world—or it involves drawing upon the empirical research of others. The first level of analytical abstraction is an ordering of ‘things in the world’, in a way that does not depend upon any kind of further analysis being applied to those ‘things’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719 | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach is a form of engaged theory distinguishing (at the level of empirical generalization) between different domains of social life. It can be used for understanding and assessing [[quality of life]]. Although that approach is also analytically defended through more abstract theory, the claim that economics, ecology, politics and culture can be distinguished as central domains of [[Social Practice|social practice]] has to be defensible at an empirical level. It needs to be useful in analyzing situations on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2013 |author1=Liam Magee |author2=Andy Scerri |author3=Paul James |author4=James A. Thom |author5=Lin Padgham |author6=Sarah Hickmott |author7=Hepu Deng |author8=Felicity Cahill | title= Reframing social sustainability reporting: Towards an engaged approach | url= https://www.academia.edu/4362669 | journal= Environment, Development and Sustainability | volume= 15 | issue= 1 |pages=225–43
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success or otherwise of the method can be assessed by examining how it is used. One example of use of the method was a project on Papua New Guinea called ''[http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-8630-9780824836405.aspx Sustainable Communities, Sustainable Development]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul James, Yaso Nadarajah, Karen Haive, and Victoria Stead, ''[http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-8630-9780824836405.aspx Sustainable Communities, Sustainable Development]: Other Paths for Papua New Guinea'', Honolulu, University of Hawaii Press, 2012 ({{ISBN|978-0-8248-3588-0}} hb 978-0-8248-3640-5 pb).&lt;/ref&gt;

===2. Conjunctural analysis (ways of acting)===
This second level of analysis, conjunctural analysis, involves identifying and, more importantly, examining the intersection (the conjunctures) of various patterns of action (practice and meaning). Here the method draws upon established sociological, anthropological and political categories of analysis such as production, exchange, communication, organization and inquiry.

===3. Integrational analysis (ways of relating)===
This third level of entry into discussing the complexity of social relations examines the intersecting modes of social integration and differentiation. These different modes of integration are expressed here in terms of different ways of relating to and distinguishing oneself from others—from the face-to-face to the disembodied. Here we see a break with the dominant emphases of classical social theory and a movement towards a post-classical sensibility. In relation to the nation-state, for example, we can ask how it is possible to explain a phenomenon that, at least in its modern variant, subjectively explains itself by reference to face-to-face metaphors of blood and place—ties of genealogy, kinship and ethnicity—when the objective ‘reality’ of all nation-states is that they are disembodied communities of abstracted strangers who will never meet. This accords with [[Benedict Anderson]]'s conception of 'imagined communities', but recognizes the contradictory formation of that kind of community.&lt;ref&gt;B. Anderson, ''Imagined Communities'', Verso, London, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===4. Categorical analysis (ways of being)===
This level of enquiry is based upon an exploration of the ontological categories (categories of being such as time and space). If the previous form of analysis emphasizes the different modes through which people live their commonalities with or differences from others, those same themes are examined through more abstract analytical lenses of different grounding forms of life: respectively, embodiment, spatiality, temporality, performativity and [[epistemology]]. At this level, generalizations can be made about the dominant modes of categorization in a social formation or in its fields of practice and discourse. It is only at this level that it makes sense to generalize across modes of being and to talk of ontological formations, societies as formed in the uneven dominance of formations of [[tribalism]], traditionalism, [[modernism]] or [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;One of the earliest formulations of the notion of a postmodern level of the economy was John Hinkson, ‘Postmodern Economy: Value, Self-Formation and Intellectual Practice’, ''Arena Journal'', New Series, no. 1, 1993, pp. 23–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Psychology sidebar}}
&lt;section begin=Lead /&gt;
&lt;!-- Lead section of this article transcluded in Developmental psychology --&gt;
'''Evolutionary developmental psychology''' ('''EDP''') is a research paradigm that applies the basic principles of Darwinian [[evolution]], particularly [[natural selection]], to understand the development of human behavior and cognition. It involves the study of both the [[Genetics|genetic]] and environmental mechanisms that underlie the [[Developmental psychology|development]] of social and [[cognitive]] competencies, as well as the [[epigenetic]] ([[gene-environment interaction]]s) processes that adapt these competencies to local conditions.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|last2=Blasi|first2=Carlos Hernández|last3=Ellis|first3=Bruce J|isbn=978-1-118-75580-8|editor-link=|location=Volume 2|pages=905|chapter=Evolutionary Developmental Psychology|doi=|last1=Bjorklund|first1=David F|editor=David M. Buss|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EDP considers both the reliably developing, species-typical features of ontogeny (developmental adaptations), as well as [[Differential psychology|individual differences]] in behavior, from an evolutionary perspective. While evolutionary views tend to regard most individual differences as the result of either random genetic noise (evolutionary byproducts)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tooby|first=John|date=1990|title=On the universality of human nature and the uniqueness of the individual: The role of genetics and adaptation|url=|journal=Journal of Personality|volume=58|issue=1|pages=17–67|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1990.tb00907.x|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or idiosyncrasies (for example, peer groups, education, neighborhoods, and chance encounters)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The blank slate|last=Pinker|first=Steven|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Chapter 19: Children}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than products of natural selection, EDP asserts that natural selection can favor the emergence of individual differences via "adaptive developmental plasticity."&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Developmental plasticity and evolution|last=West-Eberhard|first=Mary Jane|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, human development follows alternative life-history strategies in response to environmental variability, rather than following one species-typical pattern of development.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;

EDP is closely linked to the theoretical framework of [[evolutionary psychology]] (EP), but is also distinct from EP in several domains, including research emphasis (EDP focuses on adaptations of ontogeny, as opposed to adaptations of adulthood) and consideration of proximate ontogenetic and environmental factors (i.e., how development happens) in addition to more ultimate factors (i.e., why development happens), which are the focus of mainstream evolutionary psychology.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Carlos Hernandez|last2=Bjorklund|first2=David F.|date=2003|title=Evolutionary Developmental Psychology: A New Tool for Better Understanding Human Ontogeny|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos_Blasi/publication/275042203_Evolutionary_Developmental_Psychology_A_new_tool_for_better_understanding_human_ontogeny/links/553132e10cf27acb0dea90ec.pdf|journal=Human Development|volume=46|issue=5|pages=259–281|doi=10.1159/000071935|pmid=|access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Development and evolution ===
Like mainstream [[evolutionary psychology]], EDP is rooted in [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] theory of natural selection. Darwin himself emphasized development, using the process of embryology as evidence to support his theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Origin of Species|last=Darwin|first=Charles|publisher=John Murray|year=1859|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|last=Darwin|first=Charles|publisher=John Murray|year=1874|isbn=|edition=2nd|chapter=Chapter 1: The Evidence of the Descent of Man from Some Lower Form}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Machluf|first=Karin|last2=Lidde|first2=James R.|last3=Bjorklund|first3=David F.|date=2014|title=An Introduction to Evolutionary Developmental Psychology|url=http://evp.sagepub.com/content/12/2/147470491401200201.full.pdf|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|volume=12|issue=2|doi=10.1177/147470491401200201|pmid=|access-date=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From ''The Descent of Man'':&lt;blockquote&gt;"Man is developed from an ovule...which differs in no respect from the ovules of other animals. The embryo itself at a very early period can hardly be distinguished from that of other members of the vertebrate kingdom."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Darwin also published his observations of the development of one of his own sons in 1877, noting the child's emotional, moral, and linguistic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Darwin|first=Charles|date=1877|title=A Biographical Sketch of an Infant|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Darwin/infant.htm|journal=Mind|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this early emphasis on developmental processes, theories of evolution and theories of development have long been viewed as separate, or even opposed to one another (for additional background, see [[nature versus nurture]]). Since the advent of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]], evolutionary theory has been primarily [[Gene-centered view of evolution|"gene-centric"]], and developmental processes have often been seen as incidental.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]]'s appraisal of development in 1973 illustrates this shift: "The details of embryological developmental processes, interesting as they may be, are irrelevant to evolutionary considerations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Selfish Gene |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn= |location=Oxford |pages=62 |orig-year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Sociobiology|sociobiologist]] [[E. O. Wilson]] regarded ontogenetic variation as "developmental noise".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Sociobiology: The New Synthesis |last=Wilson |first=Edward O. |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1975 |isbn= |location=Cambridge, MA |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

As a consequence of this shift in perspective, many biologists interested in topics such as embryology and developmental systems subsequently branched off into [[evolutionary developmental biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morange |first=Michel |date=2011 |title=Evolutionary developmental biology its roots and characteristics |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160611001771 |journal=Developmental Biology |publisher=Elsevier |volume=357 |issue=1 |doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.03.013 |pages=13–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolutionary perspectives in developmental psychology ===
Despite the minimization of development in evolutionary theory, early developmental psychology was influenced by evolution. Both Darwin's theory of evolution and [[Karl Ernst von Baer|Karl Ernst von Baer's]] developmental principles of ontogeny shaped early thought in developmental psychology.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://n.ereserve.fiu.edu/010026902-1.pdf|title=The Handbook of Developmental Psychology|last=Cairns|first=Robert B|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=|location=|pages=|chapter=The Making of Developmental Psychology|doi=10.1002/9780470147658.chpsy0103}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Thierry Preyer|Wilhelm T. Preyer]], a pioneer of child psychology, was heavily inspired by Darwin's work and approached the mental development of children from an evolutionary perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/11304-030|title=Readings in the history of psychology|last=Preyer|first=Wilhelm|publisher=Century|year=1948|isbn=|location=East Norwalk, CT|pages=|chapter=The mind of the child|orig-year=1882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, evolutionary theory has had a limited impact on developmental psychology as a whole,&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; and some authors argue that even its early influence was minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charlesworth|first=William R|date=1992|title=Darwin and developmental psychology: Past and present|url=|journal=Developmental Psychology|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.1.5|pmid=|volume=28|pages=5–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental psychology, as with the social sciences in general, has long been resistant to evolutionary theories of development&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; (with some notable exceptions, such as [[John Bowlby|John Bowlby's]] work on attachment theory).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Attachment and loss|last=Bowlby|first=John|publisher=Hogarth|year=1969|isbn=|volume=Vol 1: Attachment|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary approaches to human behavior were, and to some extent continue to be, considered a form of genetic determinism and dismissive of the role of culture and experience in shaping human behavior (see [[Standard social science model]]).&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture|last=Tooby|first=John|last2=Cosmides|first2=Leda|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|isbn=|editor-last=Barkow|editor-first=Jerome H|location=New York|pages=19–139|chapter=The psychological foundations of culture|editor-last2=Cosmides|editor-first2=Leda|editor-last3=Tooby|editor-first3=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One group of developmental psychologists who have embraced evolutionary perspectives are [[Psychological nativism|nativists]], who argue than infants possess innate cognitive mechanisms (or modules) which allow them to acquire crucial information, such as language (for a prominent example, see [[Universal Grammar|universal grammar]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/10/nativists.aspx|title=The nativists are restless|last=Price|first=Michael|date=9 October 2009|website=American Psychological Association Monitor on Psychology|publisher=American Psychological Association|access-date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The inheritance and innateness of grammars|last=Kuhl|first=Patricia K|last2=Meltzoff|first2=Andrew N|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0195115345|editor-last=Gopnik|editor-first=Myrna|location=|pages=7–44|chapter=Evolution, nativism, and learning in the development of language and speech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolutionary developmental psychology ===
Evolutionary developmental psychology can be viewed as a more focused theoretical framework derived from the larger field of [[evolutionary psychology]] (EP). Mainstream evolutionary psychology grew out of earlier movements which applied the principles of evolutionary biology to understand the mind and behavior such as sociobiology, ethology, and behavioral ecology,&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; differing from these earlier approaches by focusing on identifying [[psychological adaptation]]s rather than adaptive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/projects/human/epfaq/sociobiology.html|title=Is evolutionary psychology just a politically correct version of sociobiology?|last=Hagen|first=Edward H|date=|website=The Evolutionary Psychology FAQ|publisher=|access-date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While EDP theory generally aligns with that of mainstream EP, it is distinguished by a conscious effort to reconcile theories of both evolution and development.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; EDP theory diverges from mainstream evolutionary psychology in both the degree of importance placed on the environment in influencing behavior, and in how evolution has shaped the development of human psychology.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

Advocates of EDP assert that evolutionary psychologists, while acknowledging the role of the environment in shaping behavior and making claims as to its effects, rarely develop explicit models (i.e., predictions of how the environment might shape behavior) to support their claims .&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Carlos Hernandez|last2=Bjorklund|first2=David F.|date=2003|title=Evolutionary Developmental Psychology: A New Tool for Better Understanding Human Ontogeny|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos_Blasi/publication/275042203_Evolutionary_Developmental_Psychology_A_new_tool_for_better_understanding_human_ontogeny/links/553132e10cf27acb0dea90ec.pdf|journal=Human Development|volume=46|issue=5|pages=259–281|doi=10.1159/000071935|pmid=|access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; EDP seeks to distinguish itself from mainstream evolutionary psychology in this way by embracing a [[Developmental systems theory|developmental systems approach]], and emphasizing that function at one level of organization (e.g., the genetic level) effects organization at adjacent levels of an organization. Developmental systems theorists such as [[Robert Lickliter]] point out that the products of development are both genetic and epigenetic, and have questioned the strictly gene-centric view of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lickliter|first=Robert|last2=Honeycutt|first2=Hunter|date=2003|title=Developmental Dynamics: Toward a Biologically Plausible Evolutionary Psychology|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4826/6e82dec5e037507e05b20259207206d1c7b6.pdf|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=129|issue=6|pages=819–835|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.6.819|pmid=14599279|access-date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lickliter|first=Robert|date=2008|title=The growth of developmental thought: Implications for a new evolutionary psychology|url=|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|publisher=Elsevier|issue=26|pages=353–369|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authors have rebutted the claim that mainstream evolutionary psychologists do not integrate developmental theory into their theoretical programs, and have further questioned the value of developmental systems theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tooby|first=John|last2=Cosmides|first2=Leda|last3=Barrett|first3=H. Clark|date=2003|title=The Second Law of Thermodynamics Is the First Law of Psychology: Evolutionary Developmental Psychology and the Theory Of Tandem, Coordinated Inheritances: Comment on Lickliter and Honeycutt|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/barrett/tooby2003psychbull.pdf|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=129|issue=6|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.6.858|pmid=14599284|access-date=2016-04-17|pages=858–865}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Evolutionary developmental psychology#Criticism|Criticism]]).

Additionally, evolutionary developmental psychologists emphasize research on psychological ''development'' and behaviors across the lifespan. Pioneers of EDP contrast their work with that of mainstream evolutionary psychologists, who they argue focus primarily on adults, especially on behaviors related to socializing and mating.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142"/&gt;

Evolutionary developmental psychologists have worked to integrate evolutionary and developmental theories, attempting to synthesize the two without discarding the theoretical foundations of either. This effort is evident in the types of questions which researchers working in the EDP paradigm ask; in reference to [[Nikolaas Tinbergen|Nikolaas Tinbergen's]] [[Tinbergen's four questions|four categories of questions]], EP typically focuses on evolutionary ("Why") questions, while EDP explicitly integrates proximate questions ("How"), with the assumption that a greater understanding of the former category will yield insights into the latter.&lt;ref name=":332"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Carlos Hernandez|last2=Bjorklund|first2=David F.|date=2003|title=Evolutionary Developmental Psychology: A New Tool for Better Understanding Human Ontogeny|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos_Blasi/publication/275042203_Evolutionary_Developmental_Psychology_A_new_tool_for_better_understanding_human_ontogeny/links/553132e10cf27acb0dea90ec.pdf|journal=Human Development|volume=46|issue=5|pages=259–281|doi=10.1159/000071935|pmid=|access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the following table for an overview of Tinbergen's questions.

==Basic assumptions==
The following list summarizes the broad theoretical assumptions of EDP. From "Evolutionary Developmental Psychology,"&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142"/&gt; in ''The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology'':
# All evolutionarily-influenced characteristics in the phenotype of adults develop, and this requires examining not only the functioning of these characteristics in adults but also their [[ontogeny]].
# All evolved characteristics develop via continuous and bidirectional gene-environment interactions that emerge dynamically over time.
# Infants and children are prepared by natural selection to process some information more readily than others.
# Development is constrained by genetic, environmental, and cultural factors.
# Infants and children show a high degree of developmental [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]] and adaptive sensitivity to context.
# An extended childhood is needed in which to learn the complexities of human social communities.
# Many aspects of childhood serve as preparations for adulthood and were selected over the course of evolution (deferred adaptations).
# Some characteristics of infants and children were selected to serve an adaptive function at specific times in development and ''not'' as preparations for adulthood (ontogenetic adaptations).

== Developmental adaptations ==
EDP assumes that natural selection creates [[Psychological adaptation|adaptations]] for specific stages of development, rather than only specifying adult states.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Frequently, EDP researchers seek to identify such adaptations, which have been subdivided into deferred adaptations, ontogenetic adaptations, and conditional adaptations.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;

=== Deferred adaptations ===
Some behaviors or traits exhibited during childhood or adolescence may have been selected to serve as preparations for adult life, a type of adaptation that evolutionary developmental psychologists have named "deferred adaptations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bjorklund|first=David F|date=1997|title=The role of immaturity in human development|url=|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=122|pages=153–169|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.122.2.153|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex differences in children's play may be an example of this type of adaptation: higher frequencies of "rough-and-tumble" play among boys, as well as content differences in fantasy play (cross-culturally,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human ethology|last=Eibl-Eibesfeldt|first=Irenäus|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter|year=1989|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; girls engage in more "parenting" play than boys),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Male, female: The evolution of human sex differences|last=Geary|first=David C.|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2010|isbn=|edition=2nd|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; seem to serve as early preparation for the roles that men and women play in many extant contemporary societies, and, presumably, played over human evolutionary history.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;

=== Ontogenetic adaptations ===
In contrast to deferred adaptations, which function to prepare individuals for future environments (i.e., adulthood), ontogenetic adaptations adapt individuals to their current environment.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; These adaptations serve a specific function during a particular period of development, after which they are discarded. Ontogenetic adaptations can be physiological (for example, when fetal mammals deriving nutrition and oxygen from the placenta before birth, but no longer utilize the placenta after birth) and psychological.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt; David F. Bjorklund has argued that the imitation of facial gestures by infants, which has a predictable developmental window and seemingly different functions at different ages, shows evidence of being an ontogenetic adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bjorklund|first=David F|date=1987|title=A note on neonatal imitation|url=|journal=Developmental Review|issue=7|pages=86–92|doi=10.1016/0273-2297(87)90006-2|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conditional adaptations ===
EDP emphasizes that children display considerable developmental plasticity, and proposes a special type of adaptation to facilitate adaptive developmental plasticity, called a conditional adaptation. Conditional adaptations detect and respond to relevant environmental cues, altering developmental pathways in ways which better adapt an individual to their particular environment. These adaptations allow organisms to implement alternative and contingent [[Life history theory|life history strategies]], depending on environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyce|first=W. Thomas|last2=Ellis|first2=Bruce J|date=2005|title=Biological sensitivity to context: I.

=== Social learning and the evolution of childhood ===
The social brain (or Machiavellian) hypothesis posits that the emergence of a complex social environment (e.g., larger group sizes) served as a key selection pressure in the evolution of human intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunbar|first=Robin I.M.|date=2003|title=The social brain: Mind, language, and society in evolutionary perspective|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=32|pages=163–181|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.32.061002.093158|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among primates, larger brains result in an extension of the juvenile period,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunbar|first=R.I.M.|last2=Shultz|first2=Suzanne|date=2007|title=Understanding primate brain evolution|pmc=2346523|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.2001|pmid=17301028|volume=362|pages=649–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some authors argue that humans evolved (and/or expanded) novel developmental stages, childhood and adolescence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The growth of humanity|last=Bogin|first=Barry|publisher=Wiley|year=2001|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to increasing social complexity and sophisticated social learning.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=Mark|date=2012|title=Imitation, play, and childhood: Essential elements in the evolution of human culture?|url=|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=126|pages=170–181|doi=10.1037/a0025168|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many species exhibit social learning to some degree and seemingly possess behavioral traditions (i.e., culture), humans can transmit cultural information across many generations with very high fidelity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=Lewis G|last2=Vale|first2=Gill L|last3=Laland|first3=Kevin N|last4=Flynn|first4=Emma|last5=Kendal|first5=Rachel L|date=2014|title=Human cumulative culture: a comparative perspective|url=|journal=Biological Reviews|volume=89|issue=2|pages=284–301|doi=10.1111/brv.12053|pmid=24033987}}&lt;/ref&gt; High fidelity [[cultural learning]] is what many have argued is necessary for [[Dual inheritance theory#Social learning and cumulative cultural evolution|cumulative cultural evolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henrich|first=Joseph|last2=McElreath|first2=Richard|date=2003|title=The evolution of cultural evolution|url=|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews|volume=12|issue=3|pages=123–135|doi=10.1002/evan.10110|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Hannah M|last2=Laland|first2=Kevin M|date=2012|title=Transmission fidelity is the key to the build-up of cumulative culture|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/367/1599/2171|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|doi=10.1098/rstb.2012.0119|pmid=|access-date=30 April 2016|volume=367|pages=2171–2180|pmc=3385684}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has only been definitively observed in humans, although arguments have been made for chimpanzees, orangutans, and New Caledonian crows.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Gavin R|last2=Gray|first2=Russel D|date=2003|title=Diversification and cumulative evolution in New Caledonian crow tool manufacture|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|pages=867–874|doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2302|pmc=1691310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developmentally-oriented researchers have proposed that over-imitation of behavioral models facilitates cultural learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whiten|first=Andrew|last2=McGuigan|first2=Nicola|last3=Marshall-Pescini|first3=Sarah|last4=Hopper|first4=Lydia M|date=2009|title=Emulation, imitation, over-imitation and the scope of culture for child and chimpanzee|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1528/2417.short|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|volume=364|issue=1528|doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0069|pmid=19620112|access-date=1 May 2016|pages=2417–2428|pmc=2865074}}&lt;/ref&gt; a phenomenon which emerges in children by age three&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Derek E|last2=Young|first2=Andrew G|last3=Keil|first3=Frank C|date=2007|title=The hidden structure of overimitation|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=104|issue=50|doi=10.1073/pnas.0704452104 |pmid=|pages=19751–19756|pmc=2148370}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is seemingly absent in chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=Mark|date=2012|title=Imitation, pretend play, and childhood: essential elements in the evolution of human culture?|url=|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|doi=10.1037/a0025168 |pmid=|volume=126|pages=170–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cooperation and prosociality ===
Behaviors that benefit other members of one's social group, particularly those which appear costly to the [[Prosocial behavior|prosocial]] or "altruistic" individual, have received considerable attention from disciplines interested in the evolution of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prosocial motives, emotions, and behavior: The better angels of our nature|last=Simpson|first=Jeffry A|last2=Beckes|first2=Lane|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2010|isbn=978-1433805462|editor-last=Mikulincer|editor-first=Mario|location=|pages=35–53|chapter=Evolutionary perspectives on prosocial behavior|editor-last2=Shaver|editor-first2=Phillip R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Tomasello has argued that cooperation and prosociality are evolved characteristics of human behavior,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why we cooperate|last=Tomasello|first=Michael|publisher=MIT Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing the emergence of "helping" behavior early in development (observed among 18-24 month old infants) as one piece of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warneken|first=Felix|last2=Tomasello|first2=Micheal|date=2006|title=Altruistic helping in human infants and young chimpanzees|url=|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.1121448|pmid=|volume=311|pages=1301–1303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers investigating the ontogeny and evolution of human cooperation design experiments intended to reveal the prosociality of infants and young children, then compare children's performance with that of other animals, typically chimpanzees.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt; While some of the helping behaviors exhibited by infants and young children has also been observed in chimpanzees, preschool-age children tend to display greater prosociality than both human-raised and semi-free-ranging adult chimps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warneken|first=Felix|last2=Hare|first2=Brian|last3=Melis|first3=Alicia P|last4=Hanus|first4=Daniel|last5=Tomasello|first5=Michael|date=2007|title=Spontaneous altruism by chimpanzees and young children|url=|journal=PLoS Biol|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050184|pmid=|volume=5|page=e184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Life history strategies and developmental plasticity ===
EDP researchers emphasize that evolved strategies are context dependent, in the sense that a strategy which is optimal in one environment will often be sub-optimal in another environment. They argue that this will result in natural selection favoring "adaptive developmental plasticity," allowing an organism to alter its developmental trajectory in response to environmental cues.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Related to this is the idea of a [[Life history theory|life history strategy]], which can be conceptualized as a chain of resource-allocation decisions (e.g., allocating resources towards growth or towards reproduction) that an organism makes.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt; Biologists have used life history theory to characterize between-species variation in resource-allocation in terms of a fast-slow continuum (see [[r/K selection theory]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pianka|first=Eric R|date=1970|title=On r-and K-selection|url=|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=104|issue=940|pages=592–597|doi=10.1086/282697|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently, some anthropologists and psychologists have applied this continuum to understand within-species variation in trade-offs between reproductive and somatic effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Kim|date=1993|title=Life history theory and evolutionary anthropology|url=|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews|volume=2|issue=3|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Figueredo|first=Aurelio José|last2=Vásquez|first2=Geneva|last3=Brumbach|first3=Barbara H|last4=Sefcek|first4=Jon A|last5=Kirsner|first5=Beth R|last6=Jacobs|first6=W.J.|date=2005|title=The K-factor: Individual differences in life history strategy|url=|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=39|issue=8|pages=1349–1360|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.06.009|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Bruce J|last2=Figueredo|first2=Aurelio José|last3=Brumbach|first3=Barbara H|last4=Schlomer|first4=Gabriel L|date=2009|title=Fundamental dimensions of environmental risk: The impact of harsh versus unpredictable environments on the evolution and development of life history strategies|url=|journal=Human Nature|volume=20|issue=2|pages=204–268|doi=10.1007/s12110-009-9063-7|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors argue that childhood environment and early life experiences are highly influential in determining an individual's life history strategy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuzawa|first=Christopher W|last2=Bragg|first2=Jared M|date=2012|title=Plasticity in human life history strategy|url=|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=53|issue=S6|doi=10.1086/667410|pmid=|pages=S369–S382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors such as exposure to violence, harsh child-rearing, and environmental unpredictability (e.g., frequent moving, unstable family composition) have been shown to correlate with the proposed behavioral indicators of "fast" life history strategies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Bruce J|last2=Bjorklund|first2=David F|date=2012|title=Beyond mental health: An evolutionary analysis of development under risky and supportive environmental conditions|url=|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=48|issue=3|doi=10.1037/a0027651|pmid=|pages=591–597}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., early sexual maturation, unstable couple relationships, impulsivity, and reduced cooperation), where current reproduction is prioritized over future reproduction.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
[[John Tooby]], [[Leda Cosmides]], and H. Clark Barrett have refuted claims that mainstream evolutionary psychology neglects development, arguing that their discipline is, in reality, exceptionally interested in and highly considerate of development. In particular, they cite cross-cultural studies as a sort of natural developmental "experiment," which can reveal the influence of culture in shaping developmental outcomes. The authors assert that the arguments of developmental systems theorists consists largely of [[truism]]s, of which evolutionary psychologists are well aware, and that [[developmental systems theory]] has no scientific value because it fails to generate any predictions.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

Debra Lieberman similarly objected to the characterization of evolutionary psychology as ignorant of developmental principles. Lieberman argued that both developmental systems theorists and evolutionary psychologists share a common goal of uncovering species-typical cognitive architecture, as well as the ontogeny of that architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The evolution of mind: Fundamental questions and controversies|last=Lieberman|first=Debra|publisher=Guilford Press|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=Gangestad|editor-first=Steven W.|location=New York, NY|pages=193–202|chapter=Evolutionary Psychology and Developmental Systems Theory|editor-last2=Simpson|editor-first2=Jeffry A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fair Trade Certified Mark''' is a [[fair trade certification]] mark used in Canada and in the United States. It appears on products as an independent guarantee that disadvantaged producers in the developing world are getting a better deal. The Fair Trade Certified Mark is the North American equivalent of the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]] used in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. 

For a product to carry either Certification Marks, it must come from [[FLO-CERT]] inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested in accordance with the International Fairtrade standards set by [[FLO International]]. The supply chain is also monitored by [[FLO-CERT]] to ensure the integrity of labelled products. Only [[Fair Trade USA]] or [[Fairtrade Canada]] (formerly "TransFair USA" and "TransFair Canada," respectively) licensees can use the Fair Trade Certified Mark on their products, however a gradual phase-out of this mark began in Canada in 2011.

The Canadian Fair Trade Certified Mark was introduced by [[TransFair Canada]] on the Canadian market in 1997.

The American Fair Trade Certified Mark was introduced by [[TransFair USA]] on the American market in 1998.

In 2010, Canada began actively promoting both the Fair Trade Certified Mark and the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]] as part of a transition process towards the latter, which became the primary Fairtrade Certification Mark in 2011.

In 2012 a variation of the US Fair Trade certification mark was adopted with the benefit of being registered globally as a trade mark. The mark is designed to pop better on the shelf through a far simpler design and the use of color. The one basket with outstretched hands indicates sharing and a "give and take" between producers and purchases. The green signals the environmental strength of Fair Trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtradeusa.org/sites/all/files/wysiwyg/filemanager/label/Fair-Trade-USA-FAQ-newcertificationmark.pdf|title=Certification Mark: Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Fair Trade USA|date=|accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fallout shelter''' is an enclosed space specially designed to protect occupants from radioactive debris or [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] resulting from a [[nuclear explosion]]. Many such shelters were constructed as [[civil defense]] measures during the [[Cold War]].

During a nuclear explosion, matter vaporized in the resulting fireball is exposed to neutrons from the explosion, absorbs them, and becomes [[radioactivity|radioactive]]. When this material condenses in the rain, it forms dust and light sandy materials that resemble ground [[pumice]]. The fallout emits [[Alpha particle|alpha]] and [[beta particle]]s, as well as [[gamma ray]]s.

Much of this highly radioactive material falls to earth, subjecting anything within the line of sight to radiation, becoming a significant [[radioactive contamination|hazard]]. A fallout shelter is designed to allow its occupants to minimize exposure to harmful fallout until radioactivity has [[Radioactive decay|decayed]] to a safer level.

== History ==
[[File:Fallout shelter photo.png|thumb|Idealized American fallout shelter, around 1957.]]

=== North America ===
During the [[Cold War]], many countries built fallout shelters for high-ranking government officials and crucial military facilities, such as [[Project Greek Island]] and the [[Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker]] in the United States and Canada's [[Emergency Government Headquarters]]. Plans were made, however, to use existing buildings with sturdy below-ground-level basements as makeshift fallout shelters. These buildings were [[placard]]ed with the orange-yellow and black [[trefoil]] sign designed by [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] director of administrative logistics support function [[Robert Blakeley|Robert W. Blakeley]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="rdmcfddnnyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/obituaries/robert-blakeley-whose-fallout-shelter-sign-symbolized-the-cold-war-dies-at-95.html?_r=0 McFadden, Robert D. "Robert Blakeley, Whose Fallout Shelter Sign Symbolized the Cold War, Dies at 95," ''The New York Times'', Friday, October 27, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Emergency Alarm Repeater]] (NEAR) program was developed in the United States in 1956 during the [[Cold War]] to supplement the existing siren [[warning systems]] and radio broadcasts in the event of a [[nuclear attack]]. The NEAR civilian alarm device was engineered and tested but the program was not viable and was terminated in 1967.&lt;ref name=nearProgram&gt;{{cite web|title=Episode 709, Story 3: N.E.A.R Device|url=http://www-tc.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/static/media/transcripts/2011-05-22/709_near.pdf|website=pbs.com|publisher=Oregon Public Broadcasting|accessdate=October 9, 2014|page=11|format=transcript|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. in September 1961, under the direction of [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Americas' Security Affairs#Precedent|Steuart L. Pittman]], the federal government started the Community Fallout Shelter Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civildefensemuseum.com/cdmuseum2/commun.html|title=Civil Defense Museum-Community Shelter Tours Main Page|publisher=civildefensemuseum.com|accessdate=September 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mywebtimes.com/archives/ottawa/display.php?id=366305|title=FALLOUT FEVER: Civil Defense shelters dotted area cities during the Cold War&amp;nbsp;– My Web Times|publisher=mywebtimes.com|accessdate=September 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter from [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] advising the use of fallout shelters appeared in the September 1961 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.em.doe.gov/Publications/timeline_sep1961.aspx DOE.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1961, in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine, an article by Gilbert Burck appeared that outlined the plans of [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Edward Teller]], [[Herman Kahn]], and [[Chet Holifield]] for an enormous network of concrete lined underground fallout shelters throughout the United States sufficient to shelter millions of people to serve as a refuge in case of [[nuclear war]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] magazine November 1961 Pages 112–115 et al&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States ended federal funding for the shelters in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bearman|first1=Sophie|title=Thinking the unthinkable: Don’t rely on these historic fallout shelters in case of a nuclear attack|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/06/thinking-the-unthinkable-dont-rely-on-these-historic-fallout-shelters-in-case-of-a-nuclear-attack.html|accessdate=27 December 2017|publisher=CNBC|date=6 Oct 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, New York City began removing the iconic yellow signs since members of the public are unlikely to find viable food and medicine inside those rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=Jonathan|title=New York City To Remove Misleading Nuclear Fallout Shelter Signs|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-city-nuclear-fallout-shleter-signs_us_5a43816ce4b025f99e18e04d?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009|accessdate=27 December 2017|agency=Reuters|publisher=Huffington Post|date=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe and Russia ===
Similar projects have been undertaken in [[Finland]], which requires all buildings with area over 600&amp;nbsp;m² to have an NBC shelter, and [[Norway]], which requires all buildings with an area over 1000&amp;nbsp;m² to have a shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lovdata.no/for/sf/jd/xd-19950315-0254.html |title=FOR 1995-03-15 nr 254: Forskrift om tilfluktsrom |publisher=Lovdata.no |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[Soviet Union]] and other Eastern Bloc countries often designed their underground mass-transit and subway tunnels to serve as bomb and fallout shelters in the event of an attack.

Germany has protected shelters for 3% of its population, Austria for 30%, Finland for 70%, Sweden for 81%, and Switzerland for 114%.&lt;ref name=SWI/&gt;

==== Switzerland ====
[[File:Sonnenbergtunnel.jpg|thumb|The [[Sonnenberg Tunnel]], in [[Switzerland]], was the world's largest civilian [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear]] fallout shelter, designed to protect 20,000 [[civilian]]s in the eventuality of war or disaster ([[civil defense]] function abandoned in 2006).&lt;ref name=SWI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frammery/&gt;]]

[[Switzerland]] built an extensive network of fallout shelters, not only through extra hardening of government buildings such as schools, but also through a building regulation requiring nuclear shelters in residential buildings since the 1960s (the first legal basis in this sense dates from 4 October 1963).&lt;ref name=Frammery&gt;{{fr}} Catherine Frammery, [https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2016/08/15/entrailles-sonnenberg-monstrueux-temoin-guerre-froide "Dans les entrailles du Sonnenberg, monstrueux témoin de la Guerre froide"], ''[[Le temps]]'', Monday 15 August 2016 (page visited on 15 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the law ensured that all residential buildings built after 1978 contained a nuclear shelter able to withstand a blast from a 12 megaton explosion at a distance of 700 metres.&lt;ref name=wsj4&gt;{{cite news|last=Ball|first=Deborah|title=Swiss Renew Push for Bomb Shelters|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304231204576405700994655570|accessdate=December 18, 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Federal Law on the Protection of the Population and Civil Protection'' still requires that every inhabitant should have a place in a shelter close to where they live.&lt;ref name=SWI&gt;{{fr}} Daniele Mariani, [http://www.swissinfo.ch/fre/a-chacun-son-bunker/7485678 "À chacun son bunker"], [[Swissinfo]], 23 October 2009 (page visited on 5 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss authorities maintained large communal shelters (such as the [[Sonnenberg Tunnel]] until 2006) stocked with over four months of food and fuel.&lt;ref name=wsj4/&gt; The reference ''[[Nuclear War Survival Skills]]'' declared that, as of 1986, "Switzerland has the best civil defense system, one that already includes blast shelters for over 85% of all its citizens."&lt;ref name=NWSS1&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=6–10|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p911.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, there were about 300,000 shelters built in private homes, institutions and hospitals, as well as 5,100 public shelters for a total of 8.6 million places, a level of coverage equal to 114% of the population.&lt;ref name=SWI/&gt;

In Switzerland, most residential shelters are no longer stocked with the food and water required for prolonged habitation and a large number have been converted by the owners to other uses (e.g., [[wine cellar]]s, ski rooms, [[gyms]]).&lt;ref name=wsj4/&gt; But the owner still has the obligation to ensure the maintenance of the shelter.&lt;ref name=SWI/&gt;

== Details of shelter construction ==

[[File:Big german fire door 1.png|thumb|Large fire door, sealing a fallout and air raid shelter inside the basement parking garage of a hotel in Germany.]]

=== Shielding ===
A basic fallout shelter consists of shields that reduce gamma ray exposure by a factor of 1000. The required shielding can be accomplished with 10 times the [[Radiation protection#Shielding design|thickness]] of any quantity of material capable of cutting gamma ray exposure in half. Shields that reduce gamma ray intensity by 50% (1/2) include 1&amp;nbsp;cm (0.4&amp;nbsp;inch) of lead, 6&amp;nbsp;cm (2.4&amp;nbsp;inches) of concrete, 9&amp;nbsp;cm (3.6&amp;nbsp;inches) of packed earth or 150&amp;nbsp;m (500&amp;nbsp;ft) of air. When multiple thicknesses are built, the shielding multiplies. Thus, a practical fallout shield is ten halving-thicknesses of packed earth, reducing gamma rays by approximately 1024 times (2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.derose.net/steve/guides/emergency/hardened.html|title=Halving-thickness for various materials|publisher="The Compass DeRose Guide to Emergency Preparedness&amp;nbsp;– Hardened Shelters"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, an expedient purpose-built fallout shelter is a trench; with a strong roof buried by 1&amp;nbsp;m (3&amp;nbsp;ft) of earth. The two ends of the trench have ramps or entrances at right angles to the trench, so that gamma rays cannot enter (they can travel only in straight lines). To make the overburden waterproof (in case of rain), a plastic sheet may be buried a few inches below the surface and held down with rocks or bricks.&lt;ref name=NWSS6&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=37–45|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm|quote="The 3-foot thickness of earth shown (or a 2-foot thickness of concrete) will provide an effective barrier, attenuating (absorbing) about 99.9%, of all gamma rays from fallout." "A right-angle turn, either from a vertical or horizontal entry, causes a reduction of about 90%." "...a large piece of 4-mil-thick polyethylene was placed over the mound. This waterproof material served as a "buried roof" after it was covered with more earth."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blast doors are designed to absorb the shock wave of a nuclear blast, bending and then returning to their original shape.&lt;ref name=lostworlds&gt;{{cite episode|title= Secret U.S. Bunkers|series=[[Lost Worlds (TV series)|Lost Worlds]]|network=The History Channel|date=August 29, 2007|number=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate control ===
Dry earth is a reasonably good thermal insulator, and over several weeks of habitation, a shelter will become dangerously hot.&lt;ref name=NWSS7/&gt; The simplest form of effective fan to cool a shelter is a wide, heavy frame with flaps that swing in the shelter's doorway and can be swung from hinges on the ceiling. The flaps open in one direction and close in the other, pumping air. (This is a [[Kearny air pump]], or KAP, named after the inventor, [[Cresson Kearny]])

Unfiltered air is safe, since the most dangerous fallout has the consistency of sand or finely ground pumice.&lt;ref name=NWSS7/&gt; Such large particles are not easily ingested into the soft tissues of the body, so extensive filters are not required. Any exposure to fine dust is far less hazardous than exposure to the fallout outside the shelter. Dust fine enough to pass the entrance will probably pass through the shelter.&lt;ref name=NWSS7&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills |year= 1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X |pages=51–56 |url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p917.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some shelters, however, incorporate [[Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear|NBC]]-filters for additional protection.

=== Locations ===
Effective public shelters can be the middle floors of some tall buildings or parking structures, or below ground level in most buildings with more than 10 floors. The thickness of the upper floors must form an effective shield, and the windows of the sheltered area must not view fallout-covered ground that is closer than 1.5&amp;nbsp;km (1&amp;nbsp;mi). One of Switzerland's solutions is to use road tunnels passing through the mountains, with some of [[Sonnenberg Tunnel|these shelters]] being able to protect tens of thousands.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news|last=Foulkes|first=Imogen|title=Swiss still braced for nuclear war|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6347519.stm|accessdate=August 15, 2012|newspaper=BBC News, Switzerland|date=February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallout shelters are not always underground. Above ground buildings with walls and roofs dense enough to afford a meaningful [[Radiation protection#Shielding design|protection factor]] can be used as a fallout shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Monteyne, David. ''Fallout Shelter: Designing for Civil Defense in the Cold War.'' Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A battery-powered radio may be helpful to get reports of fallout patterns and clearance. However, radio and other electronic equipment may be disabled by [[electromagnetic pulse]]. For example, even at the height of the cold war, [[Electromagnetic pulse#Practical considerations for nuclear EMP|EMP protection]] had been completed for only 125 of the approximately 2,771 radio stations in the United States [[Emergency Broadcast System]]. Also, only 110 of 3,000 existing Emergency Operating Centers had been protected against EMP effects.&lt;ref name=NWSS4&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=24|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p914.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emergency Broadcast System has since been supplanted in the United States by the [[Emergency Alert System]].

It is possible to construct an [[electroscope#Gold-leaf electroscope|electrometer]]-type radiation meter called the [[Kearny fallout meter]], which does not require batteries or professional calibration, from properly-scaled plans with just a coffee can or pail, gypsum board, [[monofilament fishing line]], and aluminum foil.&lt;ref name=A&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=The KFM, A Homemade Yet Accurate and Dependable Fallout Meter|year=1978|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|url=http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/rpt/112538.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040325094514/http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/rpt/112538.pdf|archivedate=March 25, 2004|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans are freely available in the public domain in the reference ''[[Nuclear War Survival Skills]]'' by [[Cresson Kearny]].&lt;ref name=NWSS11&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=95–100|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p921.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
Inhabitants should plan to remain sheltered for at least two weeks (with an hour out at the end of the first week&amp;nbsp;– see Swiss Civil Defense guidelines), then work outside for gradually increasing amounts of time, to four hours a day at three weeks. The normal work is to sweep or wash fallout into shallow trenches to decontaminate the area. They should sleep in a shelter for several months. Evacuation at three weeks is recommended by official authorities.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

If available, inhabitants may take [[potassium iodide]] at the rate of 130&amp;nbsp;mg/day per adult (65&amp;nbsp;mg/day per child) as an additional measure to protect the thyroid gland from the uptake of dangerous radioactive iodine, a component of most fallout and reactor waste.&lt;ref name=NWSS14&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=111–117|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p924.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Different types of radiation emitted by fallout ==

=== Alpha (α) ===
In the vast majority of accidents, and in all [[atomic bomb]] blasts, the threat due to beta and gamma emitters is greater than that posed by the alpha emitters in the fallout. Alpha particles are identical to a helium-4 nucleus (two protons and two neutrons), and travel at speeds in excess of 5% of the speed of light. [[Alpha particle]]s have little penetrating power; most cannot penetrate through human skin. Avoiding direct exposure with fallout particles will prevent injury from alpha radiation.&lt;ref name=NWSSC&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=45|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beta (β) ===
[[Beta particle|Beta radiation]] consists of particles (high-speed electrons) given off by some fallout. Most beta particles cannot penetrate more than about 10 feet (3 metres) of air or about {{frac|1|8}} inch (3 millimetres) of water, wood, or human body tissue; or a sheet of aluminum foil. Avoiding direct exposure with fallout particles will prevent most injuries from beta radiation.&lt;ref name=NWSSD/&gt;

The primary dangers associated with beta radiation are internal exposure from ingested fallout particles and beta burns from fallout particles no more than a few days old. [[Beta burn]]s can result from contact with highly radioactive particles on bare skin; ordinary clothing separating fresh fallout particles from the skin can provide significant shielding.&lt;ref name=NWSSD&gt;{{cite book |last=Kearny |first=Cresson H |title=Nuclear War Survival Skills |year=1986 |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |location=Oak Ridge, TN |isbn=0-942487-01-X |page=44 |url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gamma (γ) ===
[[Gamma ray|Gamma radiation]] penetrates further through matter than alpha or beta radiation. Most of the design of a typical fallout shelter is intended to protect against gamma [[electromagnetic radiation|rays]]. Gamma rays are better absorbed by materials with high atomic numbers and high density, although neither effect is important compared to the total mass per area in the path of the gamma ray. Thus, lead is only modestly better as a gamma shield than an equal mass of another shielding material such as aluminum, concrete, water or soil.

Some gamma radiation from fallout will penetrate into even the best shelters. However, the radiation dose received while inside a shelter can be significantly reduced with proper shielding. Ten [[Radiation protection#Shielding design|halving thicknesses]] of a given material can reduce gamma exposure to less than {{frac|1|1000}} of unshielded exposure.&lt;ref name=NWSSE&gt;{{cite book |last=Kearny |first=Cresson H |title=Nuclear War Survival Skills |year=1986 |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |location=Oak Ridge, TN |isbn=0-942487-01-X |pages=11–20 |url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p912.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weapons versus nuclear accident fallout ==
The bulk of the [[radioactivity]] in nuclear accident fallout is more long-lived than that in [[fallout|weapons fallout]]. A good table of the [[nuclide]]s, such as that provided by the [[Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute]], includes the [[Nuclear fission|fission]] yields of the different nuclides. From this data it is possible to calculate the isotopic mixture in the fallout (due to [[fission products]] in bomb fallout).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Other matters and simple improvements ==
While a person's home may not be a purpose-made shelter, it could be thought of as one if measures are taken to improve the degree of [[Radiation protection|fallout protection]].

=== Measures to lower the beta dose ===
The main threat of [[Radiation#Beta|beta radiation]] exposure comes from ''[[hot particle]]s'' in contact with or close to the skin of a person. Also, swallowed or inhaled hot particles could cause [[beta burn]]s. As it is important to avoid bringing hot particles into the shelter, one option is to remove one's outer clothing, or follow other [[human decontamination|decontamination procedures]], on entry. Fallout particles will cease to be radioactive enough to cause beta burns within a few days following a nuclear explosion. The danger of gamma radiation will persist for far longer than the threat of beta burns in areas with heavy fallout exposure.&lt;ref name=NWSSA&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=131|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p926.htm#Message2481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measures to lower the gamma dose rate ===
The gamma dose rate due to the contamination brought into the shelter on the clothing of a person is likely to be small (by wartime standards) compared to [[Radiation#Gamma|gamma radiation]] that penetrates through the walls of the shelter.&lt;ref name=NWSSA/&gt; The following measures can be taken to reduce the amount of gamma radiation entering the shelter:
* Roofs and gutters can be cleaned to lower the dose rate in the house.
* The top inch of soil in the area near the house can be either removed or dug up and mixed with the [[subsoil]]. This reduces the dose rate as the gamma rays have to pass through the topsoil before they can irradiate anything above.
* Nearby roads can be rinsed and washed down to remove dust and debris; the [[fallout]] would collect in the sewers and gutters for easier disposal. In [[Kiev]] after the [[Chernobyl accident]] a program of road washing was used to control the spread of radioactivity.
* Windows can be bricked up, or the sill raised to reduce the hole in the shielding formed by the wall.
* Gaps in the shielding can be blocked using containers of water. While water has a much lower density than that of lead, it is still able to shield some gamma rays.
* Earth (or other dense material) can be heaped up against the exposed walls of the building; this forces the gamma rays to pass through a thicker layer of shielding before entering the house.
* Nearby trees can be removed to reduce the dose due to fallout which is on the branches and leaves. It has been suggested by the US government that a fallout shelter should not be dug close to trees for this reason.&lt;ref name=NWSSB&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=39|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fallout shelters in popular culture ==
[[File:United States Fallout Shelter Sign.svg|thumb|Robert W. Blakeley-designed fallout shelter sign used in the United States.]]
[[File:CivilDefence.svg|thumb|The international distinctive sign of [[civil defense]] personnel and infrastructures.]]

Fallout shelters feature prominently in the [[Robert A. Heinlein]] novel ''[[Farnham's Freehold]]'' (Heinlein built a fairly extensive shelter near his home in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] in 1963),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nitrosyncretic.com/rah/pm652-art-hi.html site: Robert A. Heinlein&amp;nbsp;– Archives&amp;nbsp;– PM 6/52 Article&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5o2tUs7z7?url=http://www.nitrosyncretic.com/rah/pm652-art-hi.html |date=2010-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pulling Through'' by [[Dean Ing]], ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz]]'' by [[Walter M. Miller]] and ''[[Earth (Brin novel)|Earth]]'' by [[David Brin]].

The 1961 ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[The Shelter (The Twilight Zone)|The Shelter]]", from a [[Rod Serling]] script, deals with the consequences of actually using a shelter. Another episode of the series called "[[One More Pallbearer]]" featured a fallout shelter owned by millionaire. The [[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|1985 adaption of the series]] had the episode "[[Shelter Skelter]]" that featured a fallout shelter.

In the ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' episode "[[The Russians Are Coming (Only Fools and Horses)|The Russians are Coming]]", Derek Trotter buys a lead fallout shelter, then decides to construct it in fear of an impending nuclear war caused by the Soviet Union (who were still active during the episode's creation).

In 1999 the film ''[[Blast from the Past (film)|Blast from the Past]]'' was released. It is a [[romantic comedy]] film about a [[nuclear physicist]], his wife, and son that enter a well-equipped, spacious fallout shelter during the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. They do not emerge until 35 years later, in 1997. The film shows their reaction to contemporary society.

The [[Fallout series|''Fallout'' series]] of computer games depicts the remains of human civilization after an immensely destructive global nuclear war; the United States of America had built underground vaults that were advertised to protect the population against a nuclear attack, but almost all of them were in fact meant to lure [[Human subject research|subjects]] for long-term [[Unethical human experimentation|human experimentation]].

''[[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]'', a role-playing game, takes place in a form of fallout shelter, which has become ruled by an insane computer.

The ''[[Metro 2033 (book)|Metro 2033]]'' book series by Russian author [[Dmitry Glukhovsky]] depicts survivors' life in the subway systems below Moscow and Saint-Petersburg after a nuclear exchange between the Russian Federation and the United States of America.

Fallout shelters are often featured on the reality television show ''[[Doomsday Preppers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/doomsday-preppers/articles/get-prepped-shelter/ Shelter - Doomsday Preppers Article - National Geographic Channel]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Silo (series)|Silo series]] of novellas by [[Hugh Howey]] feature extensive fallout-style shelters that protect the inhabitants from an initially unknown disaster.

[[File:FraunhoferIWM A0059801.jpg|thumb|Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials IWM, Wöhlerstr. 11, Freiburg]]
The '''Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials IWM''' ({{lang-de|Fraunhofer-Institut für Werkstoffmechanik}}) in [[Freiburg]], Germany, is a division of the [[Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft]] which focuses upon application-oriented research. The Fraunhofer IWM is a research and development partner for both industry and public institutions whose themes include the safety, reliability, life expectancy and functionality of materials in components and manufacturing processes. The broad spectrum of services offered by the Fraunhofer IWM's business units aid their clients and project partners in the assessment and continuing development of highly stressed materials and components and in the optimization of production process. Established in 1971 in Freiburg in Breisgau, the institute expanded in 1992 to include a location in Halle (Saale). On January 1, 2016, the Halle division of the Fraunhofer IWM became the [[Fraunhofer Institute for Microstructure of materials and Systems]] IMWS.

== Competencies==
Mechanics of Materials at the Fraunhofer IWM address all issues concerning functionality, behavior and the specific properties of materials from the development stage through manufacture, processing and application. Via the material-mechanical expertise of the scientists at the institute, the properties, functionality and stress limitations of materials and components are assessed, adjusted and improved as per specific requirements set forth by their clients. This in-depth know-how lies within situations in which complex and extreme load conditions exist for materials in components and manufacturing processes as well as in performance and efficiency improvements that can only be achieved through a holistic understanding of the various aspects involved. The interaction between experimentation and simulations yields solutions to materials-related issues for nearly all industry sectors.  The scientific, technical “tools” that make up the core competencies of the institute consist of:

== Material and component characterization ==

The Fraunhofer IWM characterizes and assesses material properties within components and production processes as well as the behavior of components across several scales and analyzes the development, manufacturing and application of materials and components and offers critical support by realizing new functionalities and processing steps.

== Material modeling and simulation ==

The Fraunhofer IWM develops and employs mechanism-based material models in order to understand and explain the inner structures of material properties.  These structural property-relationships have a strong influence both on the manufacturing process and in actual application.

== Tribology and surface design ==

Stress and loads which affect the surfaces of components are analyzed and modified for optimal functionality and performance.

== Research==
Research and development activities at the Fraunhofer IWM are organized into five business units where similar project topics are grouped together in each unit. Pools of experts with the necessary competencies to achieve the desired goal are assembled from the various groups.

=== Materials Design ===
Material behavior is explained and material properties are predicted using computational and experimental methods based on solid-state physics and materials mechanics. In this way can material structures, properties, and functions be defined. The effects of crystalline defects and microstructures on the macroscopic behavior of materials are identified, enabling the effective and efficient use of material and energy resources in order to achieve long-term improvements to technical systems.

=== Manufacturing Processes ===
A vast understanding of processes and sophisticated simulation techniques enables the design of efficient and safe manufacturing processes. Services include investigations into the technological development of manufacturing processes for the production of semi-finished products and components with functional properties. This work ranges from powder technology processes, including complex fluid systems, to microfluids, the forming and processing of ductile materials as well as processing techniques for brittle materials and glass forming.

=== Tribology ===
This business unit carries out research into friction and wear. Tribological systems are optimized and solutions are developed  that reduce friction and protect against wear with the aid of technical ceramics, innovative lubricants, tribological layer systems and tribo-materials conditioned for manufacturing technology. Friction, abrasion, running-in and wear mechanisms are investigated as they affect the tribo-chemistry of machine elements such as roller and slide bearings, cutting and forming tools or motor and gear elements. Experimental techniques, multi-scale modeling and numerical simulations as well as microstructure analysis are employed.

=== Component Safety and Lightweight Construction ===
This work is centered on the assessment of a component's safety and its fitness for purpose in terms of safety-relevant demands under operational loads. The applications range from proving the safety of power station components to confirming the fault tolerances of aerospace components, the life expectancy analysis of components in power stations and vehicles subjected to thermomechanical loads to crash analyses of vehicle components. The focus is on the operational behavior of modern materials as well as joins and hybrid constructions. Development work is also carried out on mechanism-based material models for a wide range of applications with which to describe the deformation and failure behavior of components under thermal and mechanical loads. Crash analysis increasingly involves determining the influence of the manufacturing process on the failure behavior of vehicle structures.

=== Assessment of Materials, Lifetime Concepts ===
The influence of microstructures, internal stresses and damage on component functionality and life expectancy are assessed. Particular interest is paid to linking specific analyses and experiments with advanced material models as well as in understanding the demands placed on components. The work is focused on modeling cyclical thermomechanical loads and on identifying the degradation mechanisms involved in corrosion, stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement. In acute cases of damage, the institute can carry out surveys.

== Finances and staff ==
The operating budget is financed through external earnings and institutional funding (core funding). The operating budget for 2017 amounted to 20.3 million euro, of which 48.5% came from industry revenues. The investment budget for 2017 was 2.9 million euro.

At the end of 2017 the institute employed 225 permanent staff: 122 scientists, 42 technical staff, 65 infrastructure staff and 10 apprentices. Including the 68 academic assistants as well as interns, the Fraunhofer IWM had 293 employees in 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15259">The '''genetics of social behavior''' is an area of research that attempts to address the question of the role that genes play in modulating the neural circuits in the brain which influence social behavior. Model genetic species, such as ''[[Drosophila|D.melanogaster]]'' (common fruit fly) and ''[[Apis mellifera]]'' (honey bee), have been rigorously studied and proven to be instrumental in developing the science of genetics. Many examples of genetic factors of social behavior have been derived from a bottom-up method of altering a gene and observing the change it produces in an organism. Sociogenomics is an integrated field that accounts for the complete cellular genetic complement of an organism from a top-down approach, accounting for all biotic influences  that effect behavior on a cellular level.

==Sociogenomics==

[[Sociogenomics]], a subdiscipline of [[genomics]], is an integrative approach to behavioral biology that compares genomic data to behavioral [[phenotype]]. Of particular interest are differential gene expression of mRNA ([[transcriptomics]]) and protein transcription ([[proteomics]]) that correspond to changes in behavior. Data of this sort is especially useful when comparing the genomic qualities of organisms with varying degrees of social organization.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson GE, Grozinger CM, Whitfield CW (2005). "[http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Faculty/Dornhaus/courses/materials/papers/Robinson%20genes%20task%20review.pdf Social life in molecular terms]". Nature Genetics Reviews 6, 257-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

While sociogenomics integrates more fields of study and is more encompassing than classical genetics, the methodology is still considered [[forward genetics]]. The goal is to determine genes or sets of genes and their artifacts that contribute to the expression of a phenotype.

===Eusociality===

{{Main|Eusociality}}

Sociogenomic methodology has been applied to understanding the biology of eusociality include its cellular origin, caste determination in a [[eusocial]] hierarchy, and the mechanisms that mediate [[division of labor]]. Efforts in genome sequencing have allowed researchers to examine eusocial insect behavior from a molecular perspective.

Notable progress in this field was made by the [[Honey Bee Genome Sequencing Consortium]], led by [[Gene E. Robinson]], which published and made public a completed honey bee (''[[Apis mellifera]]'') genome in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Honeybee Genome Sequencing Consortium. "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2048586/ Insights into social insects from the genome of the honeybee Apis mellifera]". Nature 2006 Oct 26; 443(7114):931-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Completion of the honey bee genome and other model organism genomes has made further between-species sociogenomic comparisons possible.

====Honey Bee====

To examine higher insect social order, researchers looked into the potential evolutionary history of a “foraging gene” in honey bees (''Apis mellifera''). Honey bees have a several week lifespan divided between two phases—one spent caring for the hive, the other spent foraging. The regulation of social foraging is important to maintain division of labor, requisite of eusocial organization. In order to discover how foraging in bees is genetically encoded, the honey bee genome was searched for genes that may be shared by other species. A molecular basis for feeding behavior has been determined in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', which shares a common insect ancestor. The “foraging gene” in ''D. melanogaster'' encodes a [[cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]] mediated [[protein kinase]] (PKG).  Naturally occurring allelic variation produces [[behavioral syndromes]] in ''D. melanogaster'', both “sitters” and “rovers”. The needs of a honey bee colony are communicated between bees by pheromones, chemical signals which trigger behavioral responses. Honey bees have a variant of the same foraging gene that controls the onset of foraging behavior. Elevated expression of this gene correlates with increased foraging activity; precocious foraging was induced in young workers by experimentally introducing PKG.

Further clues to the genetic origins of eusociality have been derived by comparing quality of genomic processes. Also applying to ''A. mellifera''; by looking at the degree of [[gene linkage|genetic linkage]] and chromosomal recombination rates, light may be shed on the consequence of [[multi-level selection|group selection]] on a eusocial insect colony. Within the Order [[Hymenoptera]], primitively and highly eusocial species tend to have greater gene linkage and significantly higher more DNA recombination events than non-social species.  This trend continues within groups of eusocial species, highly eusocial species have highly recombinant genomes. While contested, recombination activity might originate from the influence of group selection acting on developing eusocial organization in haplodiploids, where colonies that can best maintain a stable coefficient of relatedness are favored.&lt;ref&gt;Gadau J, et al (1999). Genome organization and social evolution in Hymenoptera. Naturwissenschaften 87: 87-89&lt;/ref&gt;

An early study also determined the cellular basis of the discrete caste morphology of ''A. mellifera''. Queens arise when workers in a colony selectively feed chosen larvae [[royal jelly]]. The caste differentiation occurs through an epigenetic process; non-heritable factors contributing to gene expression. Queen and worker morphological forms both come occur from the same genome, royal jelly nourishment is the non-genetic determiner. The pathway to queen morphs is through increased mRNA translation in the [[cytosol]]. Biogenesis of organelles occurs at the same rate in both types of larvae, as evidenced by the ratio of mitochondrial DNA to nuclear DNA. Special feeding leads to an increase of metabolic rate for larval queen to facilitate the energy requirement to develop their larger body size.&lt;ref&gt;Corona M, Estrada E, Zurita M (1999).

==Social influences on gene expression==
In songbirds, ''egr1'' is a transcription factor encoding gene that is active in the auditory forebrain when hearing a song from another songbird. The strength of the expression of ''egr1'' has much variability, dependent on the nature of the song. Songs previously unheard result in strong responses whereas familiar songs result in little or no response. Pure tones or white noise do not evoke any response. It is thought that the purpose of this genetic response to social stimuli is to update the brain's catalog of the changing natural environment. For example, it would be advantageous for a songbird to express more ''egr1'' in a situation where there is a new song heard (a potential intruder) compared to the familiar song of a known individual. In contrast, for the species of highly social [[cichlid]] fish ''A. burtoni'', the ''egr1'' gene plays an indirect role in reproduction. In this species, there is an established social dominance hierarchy and an individual's position determines their access to resources for reproduction. If the alpha male is removed from the group, a previous subordinate starts exhibiting dominant behavior and ''egr1'' is expressed in hypothalamus neurons that are responsible for producing a [[neuropeptide]] linked to sexual reproduction.
Overall, the role of transcription factor ''egr1'' in the context of social behavior clearly shows the link between genes and behavior. As a corollary to that described above, given an environmental cue ''egr1'' will induce or suppress the transcription of other genes. ''Egr1'' shows how social experience may trigger changes in the brain's gene networks. With higher capacity screening techniques, the expression of many genes simultaneously in response to social stimuli will provide a more complete picture.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, G.E. et al. (2008) "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3052688/ Genes and Social Behavior]". Science 322, (896-899)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurobiology of mating decisions==
The neurobiology of drosophila mating behavior is an area of research that has studied in detail and has elucidated the genetic basis for behavior. The male courts a female based on [[pheromones]] from the female and previous experience courting other potential mates. The female accepts or rejects the male's courtship also based on pheromones, the acoustics of his courtship song, and her readiness to mate. The mating behavior of drosophila had been described almost a century ago, and the genetics of these behaviors have been studied for several decades. The current interest in neurobiology is trying to understand the neural circuits that provide the basis of action selection—how the brain maps sensory input, internal states, and individual experience to behavioral decisions.

The pathways that govern the mapping of pheromones to the brain of drosophila are beginning to be understood in detail. Pheromones are detected by [[olfactory receptor neuron|olfactory sensory neurons]] (OSNs). A well-studied pheromone is cVA, which suppresses male courtship behavior when the male detects it from a female. cVA complexes with other proteins to form a [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]], which binds to the [[odorant receptor]] Or67d present in OSNs, which is specific for cVA. In turn, the OSNs grow axons that will connect to the [[glomerulus (olfaction)|glomerulus]] DA1 in the [[antennal lobe]], which is analogous to the [[olfactory bulb]] in mammals. This glomerulus then connects to DA1 [[pyramidal cell|projection neurons]] (PNs) which relay the pheromone signal further to higher brain centers in the protocerebrum (anterior part of an [[arthropod brain]]). It is noteworthy that there is significant neuronal convergence taking place between the OSNs and PNs—about 50 OSN inputs to 4 PNs.

Another pathway that has been studied is that involving another odorant receptor called Or47b, which is connected to the VA1v glomerulus. Its respective pathway conveys pheromones from odors in both sexes, and when the genetics of the involved neurons is changed, male courtship is delayed. As a simple model, one would view the integration of the Or67d/DA1 and Or47b/VA1v pathways as a way to describe the initiation of mating behavior in drosophila. The former will tend to inhibit male courtship, whereas the latter is thought to stimulate mating.

It is thought that the difference in the ''fru'' gene causes the bulk of the distinction in sexual differentiation in neural circuits. Although the sensory and motor circuits are nearly identical in both sexes, the ''fru'' gene fine tunes these according to the needs of either sex. There is learning taking place when a male engages in courtship behavior. A male learns by experience, after courtship rejection by females that have already mated he learns not to pursue other mated females. Similarly, courtship of receptive virgin females is learned after past mating successes. The [[mushroom bodies]] are a probable site for this experience-dependent modulation of pheromones, as disrupting ''fru'' in neurons in this area reduces short term courtship behavior. Long term courtship is suppressed by the presence of certain proteins in this region of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, B.J. et al. (2008) "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3635/759d8789bd357e1ab9139950bb3ae60a8d87.pdf Wired for Sex: The Neurobiology of Drosophila Mating Decisions]". Science 322, (904-908)&lt;/ref&gt;

For females, the decision whether to mate or not when courted by a male largely depends on the courtship song. Analogous to OSNs, the female's [[Johnston's organ|Johnston's organ neurons]] (JONs) distinguish the quality of the song, and a distinct mechanical stimuli projects signals to specific regions of the brain, which can lead to mating. The reluctance for a female to mate again after having mated before has a molecular basis. In the male ''Drosophila'' ejaculate, there is a sex peptide (SP) which binds to the sex peptide receptor (SRP) in the female's ''fru'' neurons, disrupting pathways that would compel the female to mate again.

Future research in this area hopes to further explain how the chemical and auditory signals are processed and mapped to behaviors in the fly's brain. Though the molecular mechanisms in the pathways vary between mammals and insects, it has been shown that the information is processed in similar ways. The relative simplicity of fly nervous systems could eventually hint at how neural circuits solve complex behavioral decision making.

==Effects of oxytocin and vasopressin on animal behavior==
In the past few decades, it has been discovered that [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]] neuropeptides have key roles in the regulation of social cognition and behavior in mammals. Although homologs have been discovered which are pervasive across many taxa which have similar roles in social and reproductive behaviors, the specific influenced behaviors are quite diverse. For example, in snails the homolog for oxytocin/vasopressin conopressin modulates ejaculation in males and egg laying in females. On the other hand, for vertebrates there is [[sexual dimorphism]] in the neuropeptides—oxytocin induces maternal behavior in females and vasopressin induces territoriality, aggression and reproduction in males. In sheep, oxytocin has another effect on a female in addition to a generalized increase in maternal behavior—it induces mother-infant bond selectivity by priming the mother's [[olfactory bulb]], and the mother selectively learns the offspring's scent.

An insightful study of vasopressin is its role in the stimulation of monogamous behavior. The V1a [[vasopressin receptor]] gene is a mechanism most widely studied. Different species of [[voles]] were studied, prairie voles which are monogamous in nature and montane voles, which tend towards polygamy. Using [[viral vector]] mediated gene expression, which allows the cross-species transplanting of genes, when the V1a receptor expression was increased in the reward and reinforcement [[neural circuitry]] of montane voles, they acquired a more selective preference for their mate. Their behavior became more akin to that of prairie voles. Therefore, it is alteration of vasopressin receptor gene expression patterns is thought to affect social behavior, rather than the neuropeptide itself. A proposed mechanism for the difference in these patterns is the variation of [[microsatellite DNA]] length that is upstream of the V1a receptor gene—short microsatellite DNA in the [[5']] flanking region of the gene has a different effect on prairie vole behavior than longer microsatellite DNA. Whether this is a mechanism that is replicable in the wild is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, Z.R. et al. (2008) "[http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/19320148/1194110216/name/oksitosin+vasopressin.pdf Oxytocin, Vasopressin, and the Neurogenetics of Sociality]". Science 322, (900-90)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gonadarche should be contrasted with [[adrenarche]]. Gonadarche indicates that true central puberty has begun, while adrenarche is an independent maturational process only loosely associated with complete puberty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1931">The '''Hubble European Space Agency Information Centre''' ('''HEIC''') is a science communication office, established at the [[Space Telescope - European Coordinating Facility]] (ST-ECF) in [[Munich]], [[Germany]] late in 1999. This initiative was taken so as to fulfil the NASA/ESA [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) outreach and education tasks for the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), as outlined in an agreement between [[NASA]] and [[ESA]].

Over the past few years HEIC has become a very distinguished communication office of experts using the newest software and techniques. The European Hubble office has produced large amounts of astronomical material suitable both for educational purposes and wider public consumption. HEIC provides a well-assorted archive that is publicly available on its web page.

The work is centred on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble science results and images. These are often European in origin, and so not only increase the awareness of ESA’s Hubble share (15%), but the contribution of European scientists to the observatory. Furthermore, the group produces video releases, innovative educational material, CD-ROMs, brochures, posters, as well as DVDs and museum information kiosks, and much more.

The Hubble Information Centre is headed by the science communication specialist [[Lars Lindberg Christensen]] and the lead graphic designer is [[Martin Kornmesser]].

'''India Pride Project''' ('''IPP''') is a group of art enthusiasts who uses social media to identify stolen religious artefacts from Indian temples and secure their return. Co-founded in 2014 by two Singapore-based art enthusiasts, S.

==Recoveries==

'''[[Sripuranthan Natarajan Idol|Dancing Shiva]]''': In 2014, it helped to secure the return of a US$5 million bronze statue of the Hindu god Shiva from the [[National Gallery of Australia]]. Named ''[[Sripuranthan Natarajan Idol|Dancing Shiva]]'', the statue was stolen from a Tamil Nadu temple and trafficked by [[Subhash Kapoor (art dealer)|Subhash Kapoor]], a former Manhattan art dealer who was later under the United States federal investigation known as Operation Hidden Idol. When the gallery denied the statue was stolen, IPP used the social media to publicize and compare the images of the stolen idol with the one on gallery's display. Since the arrest of Kapoor in 2012, United States has returned to India many artefacts recovered under Operation Hidden Idol.

Ms Donna Yates, a lecturer on antiquities trafficking at the [[University of Glasgow]], believes "the grassroots work of the IPP in documenting cases of theft and bringing them to public attention is crucial - and unmatched anywhere in the world."

'''[[Nalanda]]'s 12th century Buddha''': This  six-and-a-half-inch bronze (with traces of silver inlay) of the Buddha seated in the bhumisparsha mudra,  was stolen along with  13 other  statues  1961 from the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) site museum in Nalanda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.livemint.com/Politics/CQMHtZkX51woQKhGLHlmEO/On-Independence-Day-India-gets-back-its-12th-century-stolen.html On Independence Day, India gets back its 12th century stolen Buddha statue, Aditi Khanna, PTI, LiveMint, Aug 15 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was noticed at a at a London auction. Fortunately a photographic record of the statue was saved by Sachindra S. Biswas, a retired director general of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Kumar, is attempting  to pursue India’s claim on another Buddha statue, suspected to be from the 1961 theft, currently  at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/MitejLdBdImh1v8DIM3VWN/How-the-mystery-of-the-Missing-Buddha-statue-was-solved.html  How the mystery of the Missing Buddha statue was solved, Bibek Bhattacharya, Aug 21 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20461">'''Internal working model of attachment''' is a psychological approach that attempts to describe the development of mental representations, specifically the worthiness of the self and expectations of others' reactions to the self. This model is a result of interactions with primary caregivers which become internalized, and is therefore an automatic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verschueren|first=Karine|last2=Marcoen|first2=Alfons|last3=Schoefs|first3=Veerle|date=1996|title=The Internal Working Model of the Self, Attachment, and Competence in Five-Year-Olds|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1996.tb01870.x|journal=Child Development|volume=67|issue=5|pages=2493–2511|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1996.tb01870.x|issn=0009-3920|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Bowlby]] implemented this model in his attachment theory in order to explain how infants act in accordance with these mental representations. It is an important aspect of general [[attachment theory]].

Such internal working models guide future behavior as they generate expectations of how attachment figures will respond to one's behavior.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, a parent rejecting the child's need for care conveys that close relationships should be avoided in general, resulting in maladaptive attachment styles.

== Influences ==
The most influential figure for the idea of the internal working model of attachment is Bowlby, who laid the groundwork for the concept in the 1960’s. He was inspired by both psychoanalysis, especially [[object relations theory]], and more recent research into ethology, evolution and information-processing.

In psychoanalytic theory, there has been the idea of an inner or representational world (proposed by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]) as well as the internalization of relationships ([[Ronald Fairbairn|Fairbairn]], [[Donald Winnicott|Winnicott]]). According to Freud first schemata evolve out of experiences regarding need fulfilment via the attachment figure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He argued that the resulting mental representation is an internal copy of the external world made up from memories, and thinking serves the role of experimental action. Fairbairn and Winnicott proposed that these early patterns of relationships become internalized and govern future relationships.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

However, the ethological-evolutionary aspects of the theory received more attention. Bowlby was interested in separation distress, and bonding in animals. He noticed that many infant behaviours are organized around the goal of maintaining proximity to the caregiver.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; He proposed that human infants like other mammals must have an attachment motivational-behavioural system which enhances chances for survival.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Mary Ainsworth|Ainsworth]] observed mother-infant interaction and came to the conclusion that individual differences in reaction to separation could not be explained by simple absence or presence of the caregiver but must be the result of a cognitive process.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

However, when Bowlby developed his attachment theory, cognitive psychology was still at its beginning. Only in 1967, [[Ulric Neisser|Neisser]] proposed a theory of mental representation based on schemas which later led to the development of [[Schema (psychology)|schema theory]]. It was said that these scripts might be the base of the structure of internal working models.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The term internal working model, however, was coined quite early by [[Kenneth Craik|Craik]] (1943). What he called internal working model was a more elaborate and modern version of the psychoanalytical idea of the internal world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In essence, he claimed that humans carry a small-scale representation, or model of reality, and their own potential actions within it in their mind.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In summary, Bowlby remodelled Freud’s work about relationship development in terms of newer fields of research (evolutionary biology, ethology, information-processing theory), drawing both from Craik’s idea of representations as the formation and use of dynamic models and [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]’s theory of cognitive development.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Function  ==
There are several hypothesized functions of an internal working model of attachment, both in terms of its evolutionary origins and inherent functioning.

Bowlby proposed that proximity-seeking behaviour evolved out of selection pressure.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40489212|title=Handbook of attachment : theory, research, and clinical applications|date=1999|publisher=Guilford Press|others=Cassidy, Jude., Shaver, Phillip R.|isbn=1572300876|location=New York|oclc=40489212}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of survival, a healthy internal working model helps the infant to maintain proximity to their caregiver in the face of threat or danger.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This is especially important for species with prolonged periods of development, like humans. Due to the relative immaturity of the infant at birth, offspring that manages to maintain a close relationship to their caregiver by seeking their proximity has a survival advantage.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A close emotional bond to the caregiver is therefore crucial for protection from physical harm, and thus the internal working model mediates attachment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This regulation is enforced via a motivational-behaviour system, motivating both infant and caregiver to seek proximity.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/20824061|title=Attachment in the preschool years : theory, research, and intervention|date=1990|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=Greenberg, Mark T., Cicchetti, Dante., Cummings, E. Mark.|isbn=0226306291|location=Chicago|oclc=20824061}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, caregiving is regulated by behavioural processes complementary to the infant’s proximity-seeking, e.g. the baby smiles, the adult feels reward as a result.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Having an adequate internal model or representation of the self and the caregiver also serves the adaptive function of ensuring appropriate interpretation and prediction of, as well as response to the environment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Craik especially emphasized that those organisms that are capable of forming complex internal working models have higher chances of survival.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The better the internal working model can simulate reality the better the individual’s capacity to plan and respond.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; According to Bowlby individuals form both models of the world and the self within it. These models, initially the product of specific experiences of reality, then aid future attention to and perception and interpretation of the world, which in turn creates certain expectations about possible future events, allowing foresightful and appropriate behaviour. Hence, having adequate representations of the self and caregivers serves an adaptive function.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Lastly, if the infant can be sure about the availability of the attachment figure, it will be less prone to fear due to the supportive presence or secure base function of the caregiver, which makes exploration of the environment and hence learning possible.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This felt security is the primary goal of all working models.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ainsworth researched the secure base phenomenon in her strange situation procedure in which an infant uses their mothers as a secure base.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The attachment system provides the child with a sense of security in the form of this base, which supports exploration of the environment and hence independence.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A securely attached child will, in turn, achieve a balance between intimacy and independence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This corresponds to a balance between the attachment system which serves the function of protection and the exploration system which facilitates learning.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The function of other attachment styles can be explained in terms of an imbalance of intimacy and independence, a preoccupation with one of these goals. This overriding chronic goal is intimacy in preoccupied children, independence or self-protection in dismissive children, and in case of the fearful child, there is a conflicting chronic goal of achieving both intimacy and independence at the same time or an approach-avoidance conflict due to relative inflexibility in comparison to secure attachment.

The internal working model functions largely outside of conscious awareness. Those subconscious aspects might be especially important for the function of self-protection and serve as a defence mechanism in the face of contradicting models, where one of them operates within the subconscious to prevent a threat to the self. This is mostly the case for dismissive-avoidant attachment where conflicting ideas of the caregiver as both loving and neglecting cause the defence mechanism of downplaying the need for intimacy, not relying on the attachment figure, and emphasizing independence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Types ==
Infants develop different types of internal working models dependent on two factors: the responsiveness and accessibility of the parent and the worthiness of the self to be loved and supported. Thus, by the age of three years, infants will have developed several expectations about how attachment figures will react to their need for help and start to evaluate how likely the self is worth of support in general.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hazan|first=Cindy|last2=Shaver|first2=Phillip R.|date=1994|title=Attachment as an Organizational Framework for Research on Close Relationships|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327965pli0501_1|journal=Psychological Inquiry|volume=5|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0501_1|issn=1047-840X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These internalized representations of the self, of attachment figures, and of relationships are constructed as a result of experiences with primary caregivers. It guides the individual’s expectations about relationships throughout life, subsequently influencing social behavior, perception of others and development of self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karavasilis|first=Leigh|last2=Doyle|first2=Anna Beth|last3=Markiewicz|first3=Dorothy|date=2003|title=Associations between parenting style and attachment to mother in middle                 childhood and adolescence|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0165025024400015|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|volume=27|issue=2|pages=153–164|doi=10.1080/0165025024400015|issn=0165-0254|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, four different internal working models can be defined which are based on positive or negative images of self and others.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Children who feel securely attached seek their parent as a secure base and are willing to explore their environment. In adulthood, they hold a positive model of self and others, therefore, feeling comfortable with intimacy and autonomy. On the contrary, adults who develop a fearful-avoidant internal working model (negative self/ negative others) construct defense mechanisms in order to protect themselves from being rejected by others.  Consequently, they avoid intimate relationships. The third category is classified as the preoccupied model, indicating a combination of negative self-evaluation and the appreciation of others, which makes them overly dependent on their environment. Finally, dismissive-avoidant adults aim for independence as they view themselves as valuable and autonomous. They rarely open up and mainly rely on themselves due to lack of trust in others.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartholomew|first=Kim|last2=Horowitz|first2=Leonard M.|date=1991|title=Attachment styles among young adults: A test of a four-category model.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.61.2.226|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=61|issue=2|pages=226–244|doi=10.1037//0022-3514.61.2.226|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Internal working models are considered to result out of generalized representations of past events between attachment figure and the child.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sherman|first=Laura J.|last2=Rice|first2=Katherine|last3=Cassidy|first3=Jude|date=2015|title=Infant capacities related to building internal working models of attachment figures: A theoretical and empirical review|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dr.2015.06.001|journal=Developmental Review|volume=37|pages=109–141|doi=10.1016/j.dr.2015.06.001|issn=0273-2297|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bretherton|first=Inge|date=1990|title=Communication patterns, internal working models, and the intergenerational transmission of attachment relationships|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1097-0355(199023)11:3&lt;237::aid-imhj2280110306&gt;3.0.co;2-x|journal=Infant Mental Health Journal|volume=11|issue=3|pages=237–252|doi=10.1002/1097-0355(199023)11:3&lt;237::aid-imhj2280110306&gt;3.0.co;2-x|issn=0163-9641}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, in forming an internal working model a child takes into account past experiences with the caregiver as well as the outcomes of past attempts to establish contact with the caregiver.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Main|first=Mary|last2=Kaplan|first2=Nancy|last3=Cassidy|first3=Jude|date=1985|title=Security in Infancy, Childhood, and Adulthood: A Move to the Level of Representation|jstor=3333827|journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|volume=50|issue=1/2|pages=66–104|doi=10.2307/3333827}}&lt;/ref&gt; One important factor in the establishment of generalized representations is caregiver behaviour.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Accordingly, a child whose caretaker exhibits high levels of [[Maternal sensitivity|parental sensitivity]], responsiveness and reliability is likely to develop a positive internal working model of the self. Conversely, frequent experiences of unreliability and neglect by the attachment figure foster the emergence of negative internal working models of self and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bretherton|first=I.|date=1991|title=Pouring new wine into old bottles: The social self as internal working model|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1991-97029-001|journal=The Minnesota symposia on child psychology|volume=23|pages=1–41|via=APA PsychNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As infants have been shown to possess the social and cognitive capacities necessary to form internal working models, initial development of these may occur within the first year of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Once established, internal working models are assumed to remain largely consistent over time, developing primarily in complexity and sophistication.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fivush|first=Robyn|date=2006|title=Scripting attachment: Generalized event representations and internal working models|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08912960600858935|journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development|volume=8|issue=3|pages=283–289|doi=10.1080/08912960600858935|issn=1461-6734|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, internal working models of young children may include representations of past instances of caregiver responsiveness or availability, while older children's and adults' internal working models may integrate more advanced cognitive abilities such as the imagination of hypothetical future interactions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pietromonaco|first=Paula R.|last2=Barrett|first2=Lisa Feldman|date=2000|title=The internal working models concept: What do we really know about the self in relation to others?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037//1089-2680.4.2.155|journal=Review of General Psychology|volume=4|issue=2|pages=155–175|doi=10.1037//1089-2680.4.2.155|issn=1089-2680}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, changes to internal representations of attachment relationships can occur. This is most likely to happen upon repeated experiences that are incompatible with the internal working model in place at the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One way this can happen is during major periods (meaning weeks or months) of absence of the attachment figure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During such prolonged absence, a child's expectation of the caregiver's availability to respond is continuously violated. This results in a change of behaviour toward the caregiver upon reunion, reflecting changes in the child's internal working model of the relationship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Intergenerational Transmission ==
Internal working models are subject to intergenerational transmission, meaning that parents' internal working model patterns may be passed on to their children.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Ijzendoorn|first=Marinus H|date=1992|title=Intergenerational transmission of parenting: A review of studies in nonclinical populations|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0273-2297(92)90004-l|journal=Developmental Review|volume=12|issue=1|pages=76–99|doi=10.1016/0273-2297(92)90004-l|issn=0273-2297|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, high correlations have been found between security of early infant attachment and parental internal working model security.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A central aspect in intergenerational transmission of internal working models is that caretakers themselves are influenced in their behaviour toward children by their own internal working models. For instance, a parent with a secure and consistent internal working model is likely to interpret an infant's attachment signals appropriately, whereas a parent with an insecure internal working model is less likely to do so.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the latter case, the infant itself might be drawn to construct a negative working model of the self and the relationship. Furthermore, a parent with a negative, poorly organized and inconsistent working model might fail to provide useful feedback about the parent-infant dyad and other relationships, thus disrupting the infant's forming of a well-adapted working model at an early stage.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The result will be a negative, disorganized internal working model employed by the infant.

One mechanism by which attachment (and thus, internal working models of attachment) can be transmitted is joint reminiscing about past events or memories. For instance, mothers who are securely attached tend to communicate about past events in more elaborate ways than do mothers who are not securely attached.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While reminiscing together about past events, securely attached mothers will then engage in more elaborate reasoning with their child, thereby stimulating the development of a more elaborate, coherent internal working model by the child itself.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bost|first=Kelly K.|last2=Shin|first2=Nana|last3=Mcbride|first3=Brent A.|last4=Brown|first4=Geoffrey L.|last5=Vaughn|first5=Brian E.|last6=Coppola|first6=Gabrielle|last7=Veríssimo|first7=Manuela|last8=Monteiro|first8=Ligia|last9=Korth|first9=Byran|date=2006|title=Maternal secure base scripts, children's attachment security, and mother – child narrative styles|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14616730600856131|journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development|volume=8|issue=3|pages=241–260|doi=10.1080/14616730600856131|issn=1461-6734|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fivush|first=Robyn|last2=Haden|first2=Catherine A.|last3=Reese|first3=Elaine|date=2006|title=Elaborating on Elaborations: Role of Maternal Reminiscing Style in Cognitive and Socioemotional Development|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2006.00960.x|journal=Child Development|volume=77|issue=6|pages=1568–1588|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2006.00960.x|issn=0009-3920|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James J. Kay''' (June 18, 1954 – May 30, 2004) was an ecological scientist and policy-maker.  He was a respected physicist best known for his theoretical work on [[complexity]] and [[thermodynamics]].

==Biography==
James Kay held a BS in Physics from [[McGill University]] and a Ph.D in Systems Design Engineering from the [[University of Waterloo]]. His Ph.D. thesis was entitled ''Self-Organization in Living Systems''.&lt;ref name="KayPhDThesis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KaysWebsite"/&gt;  Much of his work relates to integrating thermodynamics into an understanding of self-organization in biological systems.&lt;ref name="eulogy"/&gt;  For example, when water in a pot is heated, it will spontaneously form convection currents such as [[Bénard cells|Bénard_cell]].  This is an example where as the amount of energy available to a system increases, the system self-organizes in order to dissipate energy more efficiently.  Kay has examined how similar types of self-organization can occur within living systems at the level of individual organisms and ecosystems.  In other words, organisms and ecosystems evolve to use the maximum amount of energy available to them.  This has been backed up by studies showing that more mature ecosystems such as [[Old-growth forest|old growth forests]] are cooler (i.e. dissipate more incoming energy) than [[Clearcutting|clear cuts]] or bare rock that receive the same amount of energy.&lt;ref name="NewScientist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ExergyAnalysisOfEcoSystems"/&gt;

Kay was an Associate Professor of Environment and Resource Studies at the [[University of Waterloo]], with cross-appointments in Systems Design Engineering, Geography, Management Sciences, and the School of Planning. He was also cross-posted to the School of Rural Planning and Development at the [[University of Guelph]].&lt;ref name="KaysWebsite"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11936">{{short description|A pipeline or tunnel that discharges municipal or industrial wastewater, stormwater, combined sewer overflows, cooling water, or brine effluents from water desalination plants to the sea}}
A '''marine outfall''' is a pipeline or tunnel that discharges municipal or industrial [[wastewater]], [[stormwater]], [[combined sewer overflow]]s, [[cooling water]], or [[brine]] effluents from [[water desalination]] plants to the sea. Usually they discharge under the sea's surface (submarine outfall). In the case of municipal wastewater, effluent is often being discharged after having undergone no or only primary [[Wastewater treatment|treatment]], with the intention of using the assimilative capacity of the sea for further treatment. Submarine [[outfall]]s are common throughout the world and probably number in the thousands. More than 200 outfalls alone have been listed in a single international database maintained by the Institute for Hydromechanics at [[Karlsruhe University]] for the [[International Association of Hydraulic Engineering and Research]] (IAHR) / [[International Water Association]] (IWA) Committee on Marine Outfall Systems.&lt;ref name="Database"&gt;[http://www.outfalls.net.ms/ Outfalls Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628233110/http://www.outfalls.net.ms/ |date=2008-06-28 }} Click on "Activities", then "Outfalls repository", then "database", then "Output"&lt;/ref&gt;

The World's first marine outfall was built in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], United States, in 1910. In Latin America and the Caribbean there were 134 outfalls with more than 500 m length in 2006 for wastewater disposal alone, according to a survey by the Pan American Center for Sanitary Engineering and Environmental Sciences (CEPIS) of [[Pan American Health Organization|PAHO]]. According to the survey, the largest number of municipal wastewater outfalls in the region exist in Venezuela (39), Chile (39) and Brazil (22).&lt;ref  name="Database"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The World's largest marine outfall is located in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwsc.org/about_bwsc/systems/outfall_maps/outfall_maps.asp&lt;/ref&gt;Currently, Boston has approximately 235 miles of combined sewers and 37 active CSO outfalls. Lots of outfalls are simply known by a public used name, e.g. Boston Outfall.&lt;ref name="MWWD2002"&gt;[http://people.ufpr.br/~tobias.dhs/outfalls/download/MWWD2002-outfalls%20database%20and%20exchange.pdf OUTFALLS DATABASE AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728014543/http://people.ufpr.br/~tobias.dhs/outfalls/download/MWWD2002-outfalls%20database%20and%20exchange.pdf |date=2015-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwsc.org/ABOUT_BWSC/systems/outfall_maps/CSO_INNERHARBOR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwsc.org/ABOUT_BWSC/systems/outfall_maps/CSO_DORCHESTERBAY.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwsc.org/ABOUT_BWSC/systems/outfall_maps/CSO_CHARLES.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

According to the Australian engineer [[Sharon Beder]] the main advantages of marine outfalls for the discharge of wastewater are:
*the natural [[:wikt:dilution|dilution]] and [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] of [[organic matter]], [[pathogens]] and other pollutants
*the ability to keep the sewage field submerged because of the depth at which the [[sewage]] is being released
*the greater die-off rate of pathogens due to the greater distance they will have to travel to shore.&lt;ref name="Beder"&gt;Beder, Sharon: [http://www.herinst.org/sbeder/sewage/phd.html From Pipe Dreams to Tunnel Vision: Engineering Decision-Making and Sydney's Sewerage System], Ph.D. Thesis, UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA 1989, Chapter 8: The 'Science' and 'Metaphysics' of Submarine Outfalls&lt;/ref&gt;

They also tend to be less expensive than advanced wastewater treatment plants, using the natural assimilative capacity of the sea instead of energy-intensive treatment processes in a plant. For example, preliminary treatment of wastewater is sufficient with an effective outfall and diffuser. The costs of preliminary treatment are about one tenth that of secondary treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Philip JW Roberts:"Underwater and underused: The case of marine outfalls in wastewater disposal", in Water21, Magazine of the International Water Association, October 2010, pp. 22-26&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary treatment also requires much less land than advanced wastewater treatment.

== Disadvantages ==

Marine outfalls for partially treated or untreated wastewater remain controversial. Still according to [[Sharon Beder]], the design calculation and computer models for pollution modeling have been criticized, arguing that dilution has been overemphasized and that other mechanisms work in the opposite direction, such as [[bioaccumulation]] of [[toxins]], [[sedimentation]] of [[sludge]] particles and [[Flocculation|agglomeration]] of sewage particles with [[Fat|grease]]. Accumulative mechanisms include slick formation, windrow formation, [[flocculate]] formation and agglomerated formation. Grease or wax can interfere with dispersion, so that bacteria and viruses could be carried to remote locations where the concentration of bacterial predators would be low and the die-off rate much lower.&lt;ref name="Beder"/&gt;

== Technology ==

Outfalls vary in diameter from as narrow as 15&amp;nbsp;cm to as wide as 8 m; the widest registered outfall in the world with 8 m diameter is located in [[Navia (Spain)]] for the discharge of industrial wastewater. Outfalls vary in length from 50 m to 55&amp;nbsp;km, the longest registered outfalls being the [[Boston]] outfall with a length of 16&amp;nbsp;km and an industrial outfall in [[Ankleshwar]] (India) with a length of 55&amp;nbsp;km. The depth of the deepest point of an outfall varies from 3 m to up to 60 m, the deepest registered outfall being located in [[Macuto, Vargas]] (Venezuela) for the discharge of untreated municipal wastewater.

Outfall materials include [[polyethylene]], [[stainless steel]], [[carbon steel]], [[glass-reinforced plastic]], [[reinforced concrete]], [[cast iron]] or tunnels through rock. Common installation methods for pipelines are float and sink, bottom pull and top pull.&lt;ref name="Database"/&gt;

== Controversies ==

In the 1960s the city of [[Sydney]] decided to build ocean sewage outfalls to discharge partially treated sewage 2–4&amp;nbsp;km offshore at a cost of US$ 300 million. In the late 1980s, however, the government promised to upgrade the coastal treatment plants so that sewage would be treated to at least secondary treatment standards before discharge into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/sbeder/sewage/elephants.html Sharon Beder, 'Getting into Deep Water: Sydney's Extended Ocean Sewage Outfalls'] in Pam Scott, ed., A Herd of White Elephants: Australia's Science &amp; Technology Policy, Hale and Iremonger, Sydney, 1992, pp62-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The submarine outfall in [[Cartagena, Colombia]] was financed with a loan by the [[World Bank]]. It was subsequently challenged by residents claiming that the wastewater caused damage to the marine environment and to fisheries. The case was taken up by the [[World Bank's Inspection Panel]], which contracted two independent three-dimensional modeling efforts in 2006. Both "confirmed that the 2.85km long submarine outfall (was) adequate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/12/13/000020953_20061213134653/Rendered/INDEX/38182.txt World Bank Inspection Panel Progress Report on Cartagena Water Supply, Sewerage and Environmental Management Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Master of Science degree in engineering''' (abbreviated '''MSE''', '''M.Sc.Eng.''' or '''MScEng''') is a type of [[Master of Science degree]] awarded by [[universities]] in many countries. It is an [[academic degree]] to be differentiated from a [[Master of Engineering degree]].

A Master of Science degree in engineering can require completion of a [[thesis]] and qualifies the holder to apply for a program leading to a [[Doctor of Philosophy degree]] (often abbreviated Ph.D. or D.Phil) in engineering while a [[Master of Engineering]] degree can require completion of a project rather than [[thesis]] and usually does not qualify its holder to apply for a [[Ph.D]] or [[D.Phil]] in engineering. The Master of Science in engineering is considered equivalent to [[diplom]] degree in engineering in the countries that haven't a specific distinction between M.Eng. and M.Sc.Eng.

Equivalent degrees are:

* Dipl. ing. (''[[Diplôme d'ingénieur]]'') before name, France;
* Dipl.-Ing. (''Diplom-Ingenieur'') before name, Austria;
* Dipl.-Ing. (''Diplom-Ingenieur'') before name, Germany &lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Phased out due to [[Bologna process]]; not to be confused with Dipl.-Ing. degrees with additions such as "FH", "DA" or "DH" which are considered as Bachelor's degrees)&lt;/small&gt;;
* Ir (''burgerlijk ingenieur'', not to be confused with [[civil engineering]]) before name, The Netherlands/Belgium (NL);

[[File:Max Planck Institute for Brain Research at Night of Science 2018 (1).jpg|thumb|New building of the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt]]
The '''Max Planck Institute for Brain Research''' is located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]]. It was founded as [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] for Brain Research in Berlin 1914, moved to Frankfurt-Niederrad in 1962 and more recently in a new building in Frankfurt-Riedberg. It is one of 83 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]] (Max Planck Gesellschaft).

== Research ==
Research at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research focuses on the operation of networks of neurons in the brain. The institute hosts three scientific departments (with directors [[Moritz Helmstaedter]] of the Helmstaedter Department, [[Gilles Laurent]] of the Laurent Department, and [[Erin Schuman]] of the Schuman Department), the [[Wolf Singer|Singer]] Emeritus Group, two Max Planck Research Groups, namely [[Johannes Letzkus]]' Neocortical Circuits Group and [[Tatjana Tchumatchenko]]'s Theory of Neural Dynamics Group, as well as several additional research units. The common research goal of the Institute is a mechanistic understanding of neurons and synapses, of the structural and functional circuits which they form, of the computational rules which describe their operations, and ultimately, of their roles in driving perception and behavior. The experimental focus is on all scales required to achieve this understanding - from networks of molecules in dendritic compartments to networks of interacting brain areas. This includes interdisciplinary analyses at the molecular, cellular, multi-cellular, network and behavioral levels, often combined with theoretical approaches.

== History ==
The "Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Hirnforschung" (KWI for Brain Research) was founded in [[Berlin]] in 1914, making it one of the oldest institutes of the "Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science", itself founded in 1911. It was based on the Neurologische Zentralstation (Neurological Center), a private research institute established by [[Oskar Vogt]] in 1898 and run together with his wife [[Cécile Vogt-Mugnier]], also an accomplished brain researcher.

From 1901 to 1910, Vogt's coworker at this institute was [[Korbinian Brodmann]], who in 1909 established the cytoarchitectonic classification of cortical areas still in use today (e.g., his area 17 is the primary visual cortex). Oskar Vogt's own scientific achievements also were in the field of cortical cytoarchitectonics and myeloarchitectonics.

In the 1920s Oskar Vogt became interested in the potential morphological correlates of mental abilities, and hence in the neuroanatomical study of 'elite brains'. When [[Lenin]] died of a brain hemorrhage in 1924, his brain was preserved in formaldehyde, where it remained for two years. In 1926, Vogt was recruited by the Soviet government to help establish Lenin's genius via histological investigation of his brain. He was given some space in Moscow to carry out this work and two years later, a spacious and representative brick building that had been confiscated from an American business. In it, he helped establish and then headed the Moscow Brain Institute. Between 1926 and 1930, Vogt travelled to Moscow several times to supervise the work on Lenin's brain by the Russian collaborators who had been trained at Vogt's KWI for Brain Research in Berlin.

In 1927, Vogt gave a preliminary report on his findings in Moscow, concluding from his histological observations that Lenin must have been an athlete in associative thinking ("Assoziationsathlet") - a conclusion deemed farfetched by some of his neurologist colleagues and adversaries. Lenin's brain was, for a time, on display in the Lenin Mausoleum and now rests at Moscow's Brain Institute.

World War I delayed the plans for a new building to house the KWI for Brain Research. The KWI's first proper building in Berlin-Buch was only inaugurated in 1931 under the directorship of Oskar Vogt. It was the world's largest and most modern brain research institute of its time, including Departments of Neurophysiology (Tönnies and Kornmüller), Neurochemistry (Marthe Vogt and Veit), Genetics (Timoféeff-Ressovsky), a Research Clinic (Soeken, Zwirner), and the Neuroanatomical Departments of Oskar and his wife Cécile Vogt. Based on critical remarks Vogt had made about national socialism, a protective attitude towards Jewish coworkers at the institute, and rumors that he was a communist (spirited by his Moscow contacts), Vogt was pressed to early retirement by 1937. The Vogts moved to Neustadt in the Black Forest and established another private brain research institute, funded in part by the family of steel baron Krupp (who had already funded Vogt´s first private institute in Berlin) and by Vogt´s own funds.
In 1937, Hugo Spatz, a pupil of Franz Nissl, became Vogt's successor as director of the KWI for Brain Research and head of the Neuroanatomy Department. During his tenure, the Departments of Neuropathology (Hallervorden) and of Tumor Research (Tönnis) were added. One focus of both Spatz’s and Hallervorden’s histological research were pathologies of the extrapyramidal/motor system. In a previous collaboration they had described an extrapyramidal disease that was later named Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome. 

Between 1940 and 1945, Hallervorden and Spatz became involved in the atrocities of the [[Nazi party|Nazi regime]] by studying the brains of euthanasia victims. For many years, brain sections from these studies remained archived in the institute (which by then had become the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt am Main) together with research material from other periods. When this was recognized, all sections dating from the period 1933-1945 were given a burial at a Munich cemetery by the Max Planck Society in 1990. A memorial stone was erected in honor of the victims of these atrocities. Use of the eponym Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome is strongly discouraged due to Hallervorden and Spatz's involvement with the Nazi party and was replaced by the more descriptive terminology [[pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration]].

After 1945, the different departments of the KWI for Brain Research were relocated to Dillenburg, Giessen, Köln, Marburg and Göttingen. In 1948 the Max Planck Society was founded to succeed the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, and the institute became the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research. Hallervorden retired as director in 1955, Spatz in 1959. In 1962, a new building was erected in Frankfurt-Niederrad to house the Departments of Neurobiology (Hassler, Director 1959-1982) and Neuropathology (Krücke, Director 1956-1979), as well as the Research Groups "Evolution of the Primate Brain" (Stephan) and "Neurochemistry" (Werner). Rolf Hassler, a pupil of Oskar Vogt and coworker of the famous Freiburg neurologist Richard Jung, studied subcortical brain areas, thalamo-cortical systems, basal ganglia and the limbic system. Wilhelm Krücke, a pupil of Hallervorden, was a renowned specialist on peripheral neuropathies. He was the reason for the institute's relocation to Frankfurt, as he was simultaneously head of the 'Edinger Institute', the Neuropathology Department of Frankfurt University's Medical School. In 1982, the KWI for Brain Research's Department of General Neurology, which had been relocated to Köln, became the Max Planck Institute for Neurological Research in that city, independent of the MPI for Brain Research. The other relocated departments of the KWI were closed with the retirement of their directors.

In 1981, the MPIH was restructured towards non-clinical, basic neuroscience through the establishment of the Departments of Neuroanatomy (Wässle, Director 1981-2008) and Neurophysiology (Singer, Director 1982-2011), followed by the Department of Neurochemistry (Betz, Director 1991-2009). Heinz Wässle conducted functional and structural studies of the mammalian retina, Heinrich Betz analyzed the molecular components of synapses, and Wolf Singer studied higher cognitive functions with a focus on the visual system.

In the first decade of the new millennium, the MPG defined the analysis of neural networks as a central research topic for the institute. In 2008 Erin Schuman and Gilles Laurent were appointed as directors of the departments "Synaptic Plasticity" and "Neural Systems", respectively. The new departments took up work in the summer of 2009 and were initially located in interim facilities on the Science Campus "Riedberg" of the Frankfurt University. The construction of a new building for the institute on this campus was recently finalized, next to the MPI of Biophysics. The new institute building currently houses the three departments of the institute (those of Erin Schuman, Gilles Laurent and Moritz Helmstaedter), several Research Groups at the institute (Tatjana Tchumatchenko and Johannes Letzkus recently joined as Max Planck Group Leaders in 2013), several core facilities, and the Max Planck Research Unit for Neurogenetics of Peter Mombaerts.

{{As of|2016}}, Moritz Helmstaedter is the [[Managing Director]] of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marx|first=Vivien|date=May 2015|title=Erin Margaret Schman|url=http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v12/n5/full/nmeth.3374.html|department=The Author File|journal=[[Nat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3556">{{For|the minimal unit of meaning in linguistics|morpheme}}

The term '''morphome''' refers to a function in linguistics which is purely [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] or has an irreducibly morphological component.  The term was introduced by [[Martin Maiden]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maiden|first1=Martin|title=Morphological autonomy and diachrony|journal=Yearbook of Morphology|date=2004|issue=2004|pages=137–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Mark Aronoff]]'s identification of morphomic functions and the morphomic level—a level of linguistic structure intermediate between and independent of [[phonology]] and [[syntax]].  In distinguishing this additional level, Aronoff makes the empirical claim that all mappings from the morphosyntactic level to the level of phonological realisation pass through the intermediate morphomic level.

== Typology of morphomic patterns ==
Functions defined at the morphomic level are of many qualitatively different types.

One example is the different ways the [[perfect participle]] can be realised in English––sometimes, this form is created through [[suffix]]ation, as in ''bitten'' and ''packed'', sometimes through a process of [[ablaut]], as in ''sung'', and sometimes through a combination of these, such as ''broken'', which uses ablaut as well as the suffix ''-n''. Since these processes, which achieve the same result, are of different categories, it is not possible to call the formation of the perfect participle in English a suffix, so it must be assumed that it exists as an abstract category on the morphomic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aronoff|first=Mark|title=Morphology by Itself|year=1994|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another is the division of [[lexemes]] into distinct inflectional classes. Inflectional classes present distinct morphological forms, but these distinctions bear no meaning beyond signalling inflectional patterns; they are internal to morphology, and thus morphomic.

Martin Maiden's theory of morphomes has been mostly developed with regard to the Romance languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1029319590|title=The romance verb : morphomic structure and diachrony|last=1957-|first=Maiden, Martin,|date=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191056390|edition= 1st|location=Oxford|oclc=1029319590}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he identified many examples of morphomic stem distributions.

A different typology of morphomic patterns has been put forth by Erich Round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Round|first=Erich R.|title=Rhizomorphomes, meromorphomes, and metamorphomes|date=2015-03-01|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198723769.001.0001/acprof-9780198723769-chapter-3|work=Understanding and Measuring Morphological Complexity|pages=28–52|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en-US|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198723769.003.0003|isbn=9780198723769|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguishes rhizomorphomes, which are a property of roots (corresponding to the traditional notion of inflectional class), metamorphomes, which are a property of paradigms, a set of cells which behave in a particular way (corresponding to the morphome in Maiden's terms, such as patterns of stem distribution), and meromorphomes, which are a property of exponents, and have only been identified for now in [[Kayardild language|Kayardild]] and related languages.

In [[astrometry]], the '''moving-cluster method''' and the closely related convergent point method are means, primarily of historical interest, for determining the distance to [[star cluster]]s. They were used on several nearby clusters in the first half of the 1900s to determine distance. The moving-cluster method is now largely superseded by other, usually more accurate distance measures.

==Introduction==
The moving-cluster method relies on observing the [[proper motion]]s and [[Doppler shift]] of each member of a group of stars known to form a cluster.  The idea is that since all the stars share a common [[Stellar_kinematics#Space_velocity|space velocity]], they will appear to move towards a point of common convergence ("[[vanishing point]]") on the sky.  This is essentially a [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] effect. 

Using the moving-cluster method, the distance to a given star cluster (in [[parsec|parsecs]]) can be determined using the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{distance} = \mathrm{tan}(\theta) \frac {\mathrm{v}} {\mathrm{\mu}}&lt;/math&gt;
where "θ" is the angle between the star and the cluster's apparent convergence point, "μ" is the proper motion of the cluster (in [[Minute_and_second_of_arc|arcsec]]/year), and "v" is the star's [[radial velocity]] (in [[Astronomical_unit|AU]]/year).

==Usage==
The method has only ever been used for a small number of clusters.  This is because for the method to work, the cluster must be quite close to Earth (within a few hundred [[parsec]]s), and also be fairly tightly bound so it can be made out on the sky.  Also, the method is quite difficult to work with compared with more straightforward methods like trigonometric parallax.  Finally, the uncertainty in the final distance values are in general fairly large compared those obtained with precision measurements like those from [[Hipparcos]].

Of the clusters it has been used with, certainly the most famous are the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] and the [[Pleiades]]. The moving-cluster method was in fact the only way astronomers had to measure the distance to these clusters with any precision for some time in the early 20th century.

Because of the problems outlined above, this method has not been used practically for stars for several decades in astronomical research.

However, recently it has been used to estimate the distance between the [[brown dwarf]] [[2M1207]] and its observed exoplanet [[2M1207b]]. In December 2005, American astronomer Eric Mamajek reported a distance (53 ± 6 parsecs) to 2M1207b using the moving-cluster method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode=2005ApJ...634.1385M | author=Mamajek| title= A Moving Cluster Distance to the Exoplanet 2M1207b in the TW Hydrae Association | journal= The [[Astrophysical Journal]]| volume=634 | issue=2 | year=2005 | pages=1385–1394| doi= 10.1086/468181 |arxiv = astro-ph/0507416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neurohydrodynamics''' is a division of [[neurophysics]] that focuses on the [[hydrodynamics]] of the neurological system.  It applies physical principles and design concepts to neurophysics seeking to close the gap between [[fluid mechanics]] and [[neurosurgical]] and [[neurological]] [[medicine]].  It combines fluid mechanics principles with neuroscience to improve neurological disorder healthcare [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], [[Medical monitor|monitoring]] and [[therapy]].

Neurohydrodynamics investigates the role of intracranial fluid hydrodynamics (e.g. [[cerebrospinal fluid]], [[cerebral blood flow]], and [[interstitial fluid]]) in the [[pathophysiology]] of neurological disorders such as [[hydrocephalus]], [[Chiari malformation]], [[syringomyelia]], [[pseudotumor cerebri]], cerebral [[vasospasm]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]] and cerebral [[aneurysm]].

Neurohydrodynamics is an emerging discipline within [[neurophysics]].  Such an evolution is common as a new field transitions from being an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] specialization among already-established fields, to being considered a field in itself. Much of the work in neurohydrodynamics consists of [[clinical research]] and [[in vitro]] or [[computational modeling]], spanning a broad array of subfields. Prominent neurohydrodynamic applications include the development of [[cerebral shunt]]s, [[lumbar-peritoneal shunt]]s, [[intrathecal pump]]s, [[neural drug delivery systems]] and various diagnostic and therapeutic [[medical device]]s ranging from clinical equipment to micro-implants.  Neurohydrodynamics relies heavily on [[neuroimaging]] modalities such as flow sensitized [[MRI]].

'''Philosophy of psychology''' refers to the many issues at the theoretical foundations of modern [[psychology]]. 

==Overview==
Some of the issues studied by the philosophy of psychology are [[epistemological]] concerns about the [[methodology]] of psychological investigation. For example:
* What is the most appropriate methodology for psychology: [[mentalism (psychology)|mentalism]], [[behaviorism]], or a compromise?
* Are self-reports a reliable data-gathering&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = R. Stewart Ellis | publisher = Kettering University | title = Research data gathering techniques | year = 2010 |url = https://paws.kettering.edu/~ellis/mycourse/ssci201/r-d-g-t-good-bad.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; method?
* What conclusions can be drawn from [[null hypothesis]] tests?
* Can first-person experiences (emotions, desires, beliefs, etc.) be measured objectively?

Other issues in philosophy of psychology are philosophical questions about the nature of mind, [[brain]], and [[cognition]], and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of [[cognitive science]], or [[philosophy of mind]], such as:
* What is a [[cognitive module]]?
* Are humans [[rationality|rational]] creatures?
* What psychological phenomena come up to the standard required for calling it [[knowledge]]?
* What is [[innate]]ness?

Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[artificial intelligence]], for example questioning whether psychological phenomena can be explained using the methods of [[neuroscience]], [[evolutionary theory]], and computational modeling, respectively. Although these are all closely related fields, some concerns still arise about the appropriateness of importing their methods into psychology. Some such concerns are whether psychology, as the study of individuals as information processing systems (see [[Donald Broadbent]]), is autonomous from what happens in the brain (even if psychologists largely agree that the brain in some sense causes behavior (see [[supervenience]])); whether the mind is "hard-wired" enough for evolutionary investigations to be fruitful; and whether computational models can do anything more than offer possible implementations of cognitive theories that tell us nothing about the mind (Fodor &amp; Pylyshyn 1988).

Philosophy of psychology is a relatively young field because "scientific" psychology—that is, psychology that favors experimental methods over [[introspection]]—came to dominate psychological studies only in the late 19th century. One of philosophy of psychology's concerns is to evaluate the merits of the many different schools of psychology that have been and are practiced. For example, [[cognitive psychology]]'s use of internal mental states might be compared with [[behaviorism]], and the reasons for the widespread rejection of behaviorism in the mid-20th century examined.

Topics that fall within [[philosophy of mind]] go back much farther. For example, questions about the very nature of mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between [[mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[monism]] have been discussed in philosophy for many centuries.

Related to philosophy of psychology are philosophical and epistemological inquiries about [[clinical psychiatry]] and [[psychopathology]]. Philosophy of psychiatry is mainly concerned with the role of values in psychiatry: derived from philosophical [[value theory]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], values-based practice is aimed at improving and humanizing clinical decision-making in the highly complex environment of mental health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Fulford KWM, Stanghellini G. |title=The Third Revolution: Philosophy into Practice in Twenty-first Century Psychiatry |journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=5–14 |year=2008 |url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/fulford.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy of psychopathology is mainly involved in the epistemological reflection about the implicit philosophical foundations of [[psychiatric]] classification and evidence-based psychiatry. Its aim is to unveil the constructive activity underlying the description of mental phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Aragona M |title=Il mito dei fatti.

[[File:testedlabel.jpg|thumb|right|A common label for certifying that a device has been tested.]]
'''Portable appliance testing''' (commonly known as "PAT", "PAT inspection" or ([[RAS syndrome|redundantly]]) as "PAT testing") is the name of a process in the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mrengineers.co.uk/pat-testing|title=PAT Testing {{!}} Gas Safety Certificate from £30 Inc VAT|website=www.mrengineers.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand and Australia by which electrical appliances are routinely checked for safety. The formal term for the process is "in-service inspection &amp; testing of electrical equipment".  Testing involves a [[visual inspection]] of the equipment and any flexible cables for good condition, and also where required, verification of earthing (grounding) continuity, and a test of the soundness of insulation between the current carrying parts, and any exposed metal that may be touched. The formal limits for pass/fail of these electrical tests vary somewhat depending on the category of equipment being tested.

Similar procedures exist in other countries, for example, testing of  equipment according to ''DGUV Vorschrift 3'' in Germany.

==Purpose==
[[Health and safety]] regulations require that electrical appliances are safe and maintained to prevent harm to workers.  Many equipment manufacturers recommend testing at regular intervals to ensure continual safety; the interval between tests depending on both the type of appliance and the environment in which it is to be used. The European Low Voltage Directive governs the manufacture or importation of electrical appliances. Compliance to this has to be declared and indicated by the display of the CE mark on the product. The responsibility for this lies with the manufacturer or the importer and is policed by Trading Standards.

Testing equipment has been specifically developed for PAT inspections, based on the testing equipment used by manufacturers to ensure compliance with the [[British Standard Code of Practice]] and European product standards relevant to that type of appliance. This in turn allows testing and the interpretation of results to be de-skilled to a large extent. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The inspection of the appliances can largely be carried out in-house in many organisations. This can result in cost savings and more flexibility as to exactly when a PAT is carried out.

==Origin of name==
Portable appliance testing is abbreviated as PAT. The correct term for the whole process is "In-service Inspection &amp; Testing of Electrical Equipment" (as defined by IET/IEE and City and Guilds).

In Australia and New Zealand, the common name for PAT is simply 'Test and Tag'. The regulatory guidelines are set out in AS/NZS3760:2010.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

==UK legal obligations==

===Appliances===
British law (the [[Health and safety regulations in the United Kingdom|Electricity at Work Regulations 1989]]) requires that all electrical systems (including electrical appliances) are maintained (so far as is reasonably practicable) to prevent danger. Private houses are not covered by this legislation, although [[occupiers' liability in English law|occupiers' liability]] requires householders not to deliberately expose occupants or visitors to unreasonable risks. The HSE and the local authority are responsible for the policing of this legislation.

===Fixed wiring in buildings===
Guidance from the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET, published under the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers|IEE]] brand) and the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) recommends that a competent person must inspect the installation regularly in any public building or a place that people work. They suggest initial intervals for combined inspection and testing that range from three months (for construction equipment) to one year, and in many cases, longer periods for re-testing (certain types of appliance in schools, hotels, offices and shops).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg236.pdf Health and Safety Executive, Electrical safety and you]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Health and safety regulations in the United Kingdom|Electricity at Work Regulations 1989]] is an obligation on UK businesses, there is no obligation to undertake PAT inspection.  In reality neither act nor their corresponding regulations and associated statutory instruments detail PAT inspection as an obligation, but rather impose a requirement of maintenance of safety and evidence of [[planned maintenance|routine maintenance]] for all hand-held, portable and plug-in equipment.

Today a great many private companies and other organizations do meet their legal obligations to protect their workers by an enforced PAT regime, but it is not the only route.

Recent HSE publications have relaxed their tone somewhat to acknowledge this, and now point out that in many situations annual PAT is disproportionate to the risks and is often not required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg236.pdf Maintaining portable electric equipment in low-risk environment]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the HSE reviewed its approach to portable appliance maintenance in its own offices. Thinking about the type of equipment in use, and how it was used, the HSE looked back at the results from its annual testing of portable appliances across its estate over the last five years. Using the results of the previous tests, the HSE decided that further portable appliance tests are not needed within the foreseeable future or at all for certain types of portable equipment. Also, they decided to continue to monitor any faults reported as a result of user checks and visual inspections and review its maintenance system if evidence suggests that it needs revising. Electrical equipment will continue to be maintained by a series of user checks and visual inspections by staff that have had some training.

Annual portable appliance testing is not always necessary in low risk environments.
You do not need to be qualified as an electrician to carry out visual inspections.
Regular user checks and visual inspections can be a good method of maintaining portable electric equipment.
For landlords maintaining legal requirements it is not compulsory for them to have all appliances tested, but they do need to show a "duty of care" and most letting agents recommend that a test certificate is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;http://electricians-portsmouth.co.uk/electrical-landlord-certificates-need-know/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins in UK ==

The earliest formal portable appliance testing and inspection of both electrical installations and high risk equipment was introduced in the UK in government estates.  This was under the control of the [[Property Services Agency]] – prior to 1972 the [[Ministry of Public Building and Works]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In some cases testing was conducted on a three-month (high-risk) and six-month (low-risk) cycle from the early 1960s onwards. Extensive record-keeping was made into log-books and generally the equipment used was an insulation resistance tester, simple hand tools and visual inspection. Evidence of testing was clearly visible to workers in the form of "passed", "tested for electrical safety" and "do not use after..." labels affixed to various parts of the electrical equipment used. This early testing and inspection was done under a planned maintenance scheme and pre-dated both the [[Health and Safety at Work Act 1974]] and the [[Electricity at Work Act 1989]].

==Site and campus requirements, events and contractors==

In the UK there is no legal instrument that requires a sub-contractor to ensure that all tools and equipment are PAT inspected before bringing onto a site of work.  Neither is there any legal instrument which obliges the site owner to ensure third-party equipment is PAT inspected either by themselves or the equipment owner.

The internal policies of many UK businesses and educational establishments make mistaken reference to PAT inspection being a legal requirement under the Electricity at Work Regulations, which is false.  Having such a policy is legitimate for internal reasons, but it is not underwritten by law, it is only their interpretation.  Therefore, it is not a legal requirement to have a PAT inspection sticker or certificate, the obligation is that equipment must be safe.

The HSE recommend policies use phrases such as "Equipment that is brought onto site for an event must be in a safe condition" and refrain from overzealous statements such as "must be PAT inspected" which can be restrictive without improving safety.  Overall it is safer if a competent person makes a visual inspection than if a layman merely observes the presence of a sticker.

==Carrying out PAT ==

This can be done by hiring an external company to test all the electrical products in a business (someone who has had some PAT training, either by an official qualification or by attending a health and safety course offered by some electrical health and safety companies) or it can be done in-house by a competent person.  In a low-risk environment most dangerous defects can be found simply by checking the appliances for obvious signs of damage such as frayed cables.

===User checks===
Advising the user of potential danger signs can result in problems being picked up before they can result in any danger. For example, if the power cable is frayed or the plug is cracked, users need to be advised not to use the appliance and report the fault to a supervisor. This information can be put across, say by the use of a poster or in a memo. User checks are always carried out before operation, and the results are generally not recorded, unless a defect is identified.

===Formal visual inspections===
This is a process of simply inspecting the appliance, the cable and the plug for any obvious signs of damage. According to the HSE, this process can find more than 90% of faults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energysafety.govt.nz/about/publications/accident-summaries Faults and electrical safety]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combined inspections and PAT ===
At periodic intervals, the portable appliances are tested to measure that the degree of protection to ensure that it is adequate. At these intervals, a formal visual inspection is carried out and then followed by PAT testing. Note the inside of the plug should be checked unless it is moulded or there is an unbroken seal covering the screws (bad internal wiring or an unsuitable fuse would cause the item to be classed as dangerous).

==Testing==

The tests an appliance is required to undergo will depend on the type of appliance, its electrical [[Appliance classes|Class]] and subject to a risk assessment by the technician. e.g. it may not be safe to perform a leakage current test which powers up the appliance, such as a grinder, if it can not be secured to a bench; an insulation resistance test may be a safe option.

===Earth resistance test===
This test shows the resistance offered by the earthing rods with the connection leads. Various testing instruments are available for earthing resistance tests. The earthing resistance should be less than 1Ω.

===Earth continuity test===
The equipment shall have a measured resistance of the [[Protective earth|protective earth circuit]], or the earthing conductor of an extension cord or appliance cord set, which does not exceed 1Ω.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing is performed using an ohmmeter or [[Portable Appliance Test|PAT]] tester;
* Using the ohmmeter to produce a reading;
* Using a PAT tester under the following conditions;
** 12V maximum, test current range 100mA to 200mA - commonly known as "earth continuity test" or "screen test" 
** 12V maximum, test current 10A - commonly known as "routine test" 
** 12V maximum, 1.5 times rated current of appliance or 25A, whichever is greater - commonly known as "type test" or "bond test".

The choice of which of the tests to use is at the operator's discretion as there is merit in each test for given situations.  Later model testers that are battery powered are limited to doing the "screen test". Older mains powered units can do all tests. Even "type testing" may only be testing at a fraction of the operational power of the unit.The power dissipated in the earth is only 300 watts compared to operational power which may be in excess of 2000 watts.

===Insulation resistance test===

A leakage current test performed at rated voltage with values not exceeding 5mA for [[Appliance classes|Class I]] appliances or 1mA for [[Appliance classes|Class II]] appliances.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2. 3.3.2(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, measure [[Electrical insulation|insulation resistance]] values are not less than 1MΩ for Class I and Class II appliances at 500 V d.c. or alternatively, to avoid the equipment apparently failing the test because the [[Surge protector|metal oxide varistors]] (MOVs), or electro-magnetic interference (EMI) suppression has triggered, for equipment containing voltage limiting devices such as MOVs, or EMI suppression, at 250 V d.c.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.2(b). General&lt;/ref&gt;

Leakage current testing is performed using a PAT by applying a nominal voltage to the live conductors (active and neutral) of an appliance, and placing 0 volt reference on the earthed parts of a Class I appliance or the external metal parts of a [[Appliance classes|Class II]] appliance;
* Nominal voltage is 230V AC. (therefore it can not be performed with a digital multimeter)

Insulation resistance testing is performed using an ohmmeter or portable appliance tester by applying a nominal voltage to the live conductors (active and neutral) of an appliance, and placing 0 volt reference on the earthed parts of a [[Appliance classes|Class I]] appliance or the external metal parts of a [[Appliance classes|Class II]] appliance;
* Nominal voltage is 500V d.c (250 V d.c. may be used for equipment containing [[Surge protector|MOVs]] / EMI filtering)

A deficiency of the insulation resistance (500V/250V d.c) test is that the d.c voltage will not activate electromagnetic switches or internal relays etc. that are common in many modern power tools, computers, TVs etc. and therefore it can only test the appliance up to that point. Appliances with these components / design should be tested using the leakage current test.

===Polarity check===
In countries where the sockets are polarised, polarity testing is a simple test that can be carried out using a polarity tester to determine whether the active and neutral of the plug end are correctly connected to the corresponding terminals at the socket end.&lt;ref&gt;BS7671 wiring rules OR Best Practices in Testing &amp; Tagging of Electrical Equipment to AS/NZS 3760:2003. (Zahra &amp; Virieux 2007) 5.8.1&lt;/ref&gt; Note: The earth is tested during the [[#Earth continuity test|earth continuity test]]. In the UK, as per BS7671, the phase ('Live' or 'Hot') cable should connect with right hand side terminal of the socket (if we face the socket outlet).

====Plugs====
*The order ([[Electrical polarity|polarity]]) of the pins of a three pin flat pin plug, to their connections, shall be Earth (radial pin – green/yellow wire), Neutral (light blue wire) and then Active (brown wire), in a clockwise direction, when viewed from the front of the plug looking at the pins.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.5(a). General&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cord extension sockets====
*The order ([[Electrical polarity|polarity]]) of the socket apertures of a three pin flat pin socket, to their connections, shall be Earth (radial pin – green/yellow wire), Active (brown wire) and then Neutral (light blue wire), in a clockwise direction, when viewed from the front of the socket looking at the apertures.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.5(b). General&lt;/ref&gt;

===RCDs / ELCBs / Safety Switches===
There are two tests methods to be used;

====Press button====
This test requires specific test equipment RCD tester:

(the TEST button referred to here is the test button on the RCD tester NOT the TEST button on the RCD itself. If the RCD is live, pressing the RCD's own TEST button should ALWAYS trip the RCD).

The RCD tester should be connected with the socket, with earth terminal (must !!) and 
1)select the testing range 'delta' (10mA,30mA,100mA,300mA,500mA).
2)Select half delta range, and press TEST button - the RCD should not operate, this ensures against nuisance tripping.
3)Select delta range, and press TEST button - The RCD should operate, within m Sec for 50&amp;nbsp;Hz,230V system (as per BS 7671)

====Applied current====
This test requires specialised test equipment, knowledge and training;
*A current, equal to the rated tripping current, shall be “suddenly” applied between active and protective earth and the operating time measured&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Appendix D D3&lt;/ref&gt; with maximum trip time 40ms for Type I and 300ms for Type II.

In addition to this, many technicians also test;
*using 1/2 (half) the rated tripping current to detect nuisance tripping.
*using 5 times rated tripping current, with trip times reduced accordingly, to simulate high current exposure.
* under 0 degree and 180 degree phases

Best Practice is to test the RCD under 1/2, 1X and 5X rated tripping current, each at both the 0 degree and 180 degree phases.

===Microwave ovens===
There are two specific extra checks mandated for microwave ovens in the United Kingdom.

The first is that the device immediately ceases production of the microwave radiation when the door is opened, which checks that the safety interlock systems are functional; and the second is that any leakage when operating is less than 5 mWcm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; which indicates that the door and casing are not distorted and any seals are intact so that there is no hazard to those in the vicinity of the equipment.

A piece of calibrated equipment is required for these tests to detect and measure leakage of the 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz microwave radiation, it is usually a hand-held device with a sensing antenna that can be scanned over the areas where the door meets the casing to find any radiation ''hot-spots'' whilst the unit is operating.  As Microwave ovens are not normally designed to be operated without a load this will usually take the form of an open container containing a quantity of water which is used to absorb the energy and as it gets warmed gives an indication that a unit not previously examined by a tester is actually producing microwaves.  After checking for leakage the door is required to be opened by whatever means is provided and the measurement device is not to record a level above the given limit.  In some scenarios a known quantity of water is heated for a known period of time and the temperature rise over the period of operation is used to generate an indication of the effective power output of the magnetron. This can be helpful to determine whether the oven is operating at the expected power levels indicated by labelling.

== Class of construction ==
Electrical [[appliance classes]] are differentiated by a series of IEC protection classes.  The protocols for PAT Testing vary by appliance class. 
*'''Class I''' – Single insulated wiring, which requires an earth connection. There is no symbol for a Class I product so if a rating plate has no symbol on it then it is usually Class I.
*'''Class II''' – Double insulated wiring, The earth clamp is still connected during the insulation test even though no earth on appliance. Class II is indicated by double box.
*'''Class III''' – These are appliances that are supplied at a low voltage (usually called Separated Extra Low Voltage) which must be less than 50&amp;nbsp;V. These appliances are supplied with a transformer supply that is also marked.

The earth lead is connected to metal parts on both Class I and Class II appliances. For "Class I" during the earth test to prove continuity between earth pin and metal parts on the appliance. For "Class II" during the insulation test to prove the insulation between active-neutral and the metal parts of the appliance. i.e. there is no leakage from mains coming into the appliance to the metal parts that are exposed.

==PAT training and qualifications==
[[File:PATtest.JPG|right|thumb|PAT testing at a workbench]]

In the UK, there is no requirement to have a formal qualification for persons carrying out PAT Testing.  The Electricity at Work regulations of 1989 simply state that where required, inspecting and testing must be carried out by a competent person, however does not mention a benchmark for competency.  It has become accepted practice, however, for individuals operating as PAT Testers to hold a 2377–22 City and Guilds qualification.  PAT Testers in the UK do not need to be electricians or have a background in the electrical industry. An example of a nationally recognised qualification of competence in PAT is offered by [[City and Guilds of London Institute|City &amp; Guilds]]: 'Code of Practice for In-service Inspection and Testing of Electrical Equipment – 4th Edition (No. 2377)'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityandguilds.com/cps/rde/xchg/SID-850C2351-18A457AB/cgonline/hs.xsl/1779.html?search_term=2377 City &amp; Guilds 'Code of Practice for In-service Inspection and Testing of Electrical Equipment' qualification]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are others provided by EAL available.

In Australia it is a legal requirement to have attended a course or gained a qualification in order to PAT.  Proof of a company’s competence takes the form of a course certificate or qualification. A formal examination process for the topic is operated in collaboration with EAL or city and guilds (the awarding body) under the authority of the QCA (The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority) who validate and authorise the qualification.

==Types of PAT testers==
At the basic level PAT test instruments carry out basic safety checks. Most are equipped with an earth continuity test, insulation resistance test and the ability to check the wiring of detachable mains cords. Many do not however include tests which involve applying mains power to the appliance under test, for example, a protective conductor current or touch current tests. The main kind for businesses are simple PASS/FAIL testers that are easy to use, and are aimed at in-house PAT testing with minimal interpretation of results. Advanced PAT testers can give much more information and testing features but are mainly aimed at more highly skilled users.

===Pass / fail PAT testers===
These are the simple-to-use and comparatively much cheaper portable appliance testers for most businesses who will test in-house to carry out the testing and suitable for a wide range of businesses. They simply say PASS or FAIL when a test is carried out. Mains powered testers require AC power.   Battery operated PAT testers are self-contained and convenient to use. They usually come with rechargeable batteries.

These testers have a simple "lights" system. They have a "Pass" light, a "Fail" light, options for Class I metal / plastic or Class II. They also will show:
*earth continuity
*insulation resistance
*polarity.

===Advanced PAT testers===

These testers display more information than just pass or fail, including:
*Earth continuity resistance (aka Earth Bond) tests with a measurement range of 0 – 1.99&amp;nbsp;Ω at high test currents (usually 8&amp;nbsp;A, 10&amp;nbsp;A or 25&amp;nbsp;A) and lower test currents (in the range 20&amp;nbsp;mA to 200&amp;nbsp;mA), enabling a complete range of appliances including personal computers to be tested;
*Insulation resistance tests at test voltages of 500&amp;nbsp;V DC or 250&amp;nbsp;V DC.
*Protective conductor/touch current measurement (sometimes referred to as "earth leakage tests" on some older PAT units);
*Fuse test;
*Lead polarity.

These readings require interpretation by an electrician or someone with electrical understanding. Advanced PAT testers are effective as facilities management tools because they can record the location and test status of electrical equipment and appliances.

'''RCD testing'''

Some units can also test [[Residual-current device]]s, following the recommendation in the current IEE Code of Practice to test any RCD fitted on an extension lead or multiway adapter. 
[[Image:PrimeTest 250 RCD.jpg|thumb|left|Modern PAT testers include an RCD test]]

===Computerised PAT testers===
Some advanced PAT testers can download information to a computer. Bluetooth enabled computerised PAT testers make the two way transfer of test data between the tester and PC-based record keeping systems much simpler, and can be used with other test accessories such as label printers. Records can be maintained using PAT software such as [https://patorganiser.com.au PATorganiser]

== Calibration of testers ==
As PAT testers are sophisticated instruments, it is important to make sure that they are continuing to measure correctly. If a company fails to check and maintain calibration, it could face difficulty substantiating any measurements in the event of a claim. It is usually recommended that calibration is carried out annually on a PAT testing unit.

When a PAT tester is calibrated it is re-configuring it to match the original specification. This includes:

*Calibrating the unit back to national standards. This is best performed by the product manufacturer (if they offer a calibration service) or a laboratory accredited by [[United Kingdom Accreditation Service]] (UKAS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukas.com/ The United Kingdom Accreditation Service]&lt;/ref&gt;
*If it is mains powered, then a safety test must be carried out.
*A calibration certificate should be issued to prove the PAT unit has been electrically tested.

Dual purpose check boxes (which are essentially known resistances either side of the test limits)have also been introduced which are capable of validating the accuracy of both electrical installation testers and portable appliance testers in the field, reducing the risk of a tester being used when not operating correctly - this also allows the re-calibration interval to be increased.

'''Reverse mathematics''' is a program in [[mathematical logic]] that seeks to determine which axioms are required to prove theorems of mathematics.  Its defining method can briefly be described as "going backwards from the [[theorem]]s to the [[axiom]]s", in contrast to the ordinary mathematical practice of deriving theorems from axioms. It can be conceptualized as sculpting out [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary]] conditions from [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]] ones.

The reverse mathematics program was foreshadowed by results in set theory such as the classical theorem that the [[axiom of choice]] and [[Zorn's lemma]] are equivalent over [[ZF set theory]]. The goal of reverse mathematics, however, is to study possible axioms of ordinary theorems of mathematics rather than possible axioms for set theory.

Reverse mathematics is usually carried out using subsystems of [[second-order arithmetic]], where many of its definitions and methods are inspired by previous work in [[constructive analysis]] and [[proof theory]]. The use of second-order arithmetic also allows many techniques from [[recursion theory]] to be employed; many results in reverse mathematics have corresponding results in [[computable analysis]].

The program was founded by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Harvey Friedman|first=Harvey|last= Friedman|year1=1975|year2=1976}} and brought forward by [[Steve Simpson (mathematician)|Steve Simpson]].  A standard reference for the subject is {{harv|Simpson|2009}}, while an introduction for non-specialists is {{harv|Stillwell|2018}}.

== General principles ==
In reverse mathematics, one starts with a framework language and a base theory—a core axiom system—that is too weak to prove most of the theorems one might be interested in, but still powerful enough to develop the definitions necessary to state these theorems.  For example, to study the theorem “Every bounded sequence of [[real number]]s has a [[supremum]]” it is necessary to use a base system which can speak of real numbers and sequences of real numbers.

For each theorem that can be stated in the base system but is not provable in the base system, the goal is to determine the particular axiom system (stronger than the base system) that is necessary to prove that theorem. To show that a system ''S'' is required to prove a theorem ''T'', two proofs are required. The first proof shows ''T'' is provable from ''S''; this is an ordinary mathematical proof along with a justification that it can be carried out in the system ''S''. The second proof, known as a '''reversal''', shows that ''T'' itself implies ''S''; this proof is carried out in the base system. The reversal establishes that no axiom system ''S&amp;prime;'' that extends the base system can be weaker than ''S'' while still proving&amp;nbsp;''T''.

=== Use of second-order arithmetic ===

Most reverse mathematics research focuses on subsystems of [[second-order arithmetic]]. The body of research in reverse mathematics has established that weak subsystems of second-order arithmetic suffice to formalize almost all undergraduate-level mathematics. In second-order arithmetic, all objects can be represented as either [[natural number]]s or sets of natural numbers.  For example, in order to prove theorems about real numbers, the real numbers can be represented as [[Cauchy sequence]]s of [[rational number]]s, each of which can be represented as a set of natural numbers.

The axiom systems most often considered in reverse mathematics are defined using [[axiom scheme]]s called '''comprehension schemes'''.  Such a scheme states that any set of natural numbers definable by a formula of a given complexity exists. In this context, the complexity of formulas is measured using the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] and [[analytical hierarchy]].

The reason that reverse mathematics is not carried out using set theory as a base system is that the language of set theory is too expressive.  Extremely complex sets of natural numbers can be defined by simple formulas in the language of set theory (which can quantify over arbitrary sets). In the context of second-order arithmetic, results such as [[Post's theorem]] establish a close link between the complexity of a formula and the (non)computability of the set it defines.

Another effect of using second-order arithmetic is the need to restrict general mathematical theorems to forms that can be expressed within arithmetic. For example, second-order arithmetic can express the principle "Every countable [[vector space]] has a basis" but it cannot express the principle "Every vector space has a basis". In practical terms, this means that theorems of algebra and combinatorics are restricted to countable structures, while theorems of analysis and topology are restricted to [[separable space]]s. Many principles that imply the [[axiom of choice]] in their general form (such as "Every vector space has a basis") become provable in weak subsystems of second-order arithmetic when they are restricted. For example, "every field has an algebraic closure" is not provable in ZF set theory, but the restricted form "every countable field has an algebraic closure" is provable in RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the weakest system typically employed in reverse mathematics.

=== Use of higher-order arithmetic ===

A recent strand of ''higher-order'' reverse mathematics research, initiated by [[Ulrich Kohlenbach]], focuses on subsystems of [[higher-order arithmetic]] ({{harvtxt|Kohlenbach|2005}}). 
Due to the richer language of higher-order arithmetic, the use of representations (aka 'codes') common in second-order arithmetic, is greatly reduced.  
For example, a continuous function on the [[Cantor space]] is just a function that maps binary sequences to binary sequences, and that also satisfies the usual 'epsilon-delta'-definition of continuity. 

Higher-order reverse mathematics includes higher-order versions of (second-order) comprehension schemes.  Such an higher-order axiom states the existence of a functional that decides the truth or falsity of formulas of a given complexity. In this context, the complexity of formulas is also measured using the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] and [[analytical hierarchy]].  The higher-order counterparts of the major subsystems of second-order arithmetic generally prove the same second-order sentences (or a large subset) as the original second-order systems (see {{harvtxt|Kohlenbach|2005}} and {{harvtxt|Hunter|2008}}).  For instance, the base theory of higher-order reverse mathematics, called RCA&lt;sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, proves the same sentences as RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, up to language.  

As noted in the previous paragraph, second-order comprehension axioms easily generalize to the higher-order framework.  However, theorems expressing the ''[[compactness]]'' of basic spaces behave quite differently in second- and higher-order arithmetic: on one hand, when restricted to countable covers/the language of second-order arithmetic, the compactness of the unit interval is provable in WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; from the next section.  On the other hand, given uncountable covers/the language of higher-order arithmetic, the compactness of the unit interval is only provable from (full) second-order arithmetic ({{harvtxt|Normann-Sanders|2017}}).  Other covering lemmas (e.g. due to [[Lindelöf]], [[Vitali]], [[Besicovitch]], etc) exhibit the same behavior, and many basic properties of the [[gauge integral]] are equivalent to the compactness of the underlying space.

== The big five subsystems of second-order arithmetic ==

[[Second-order arithmetic]] is a formal theory of the natural numbers and sets of natural numbers.  Many mathematical objects, such as [[countable set|countable]] [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[group (mathematics)|groups]], and [[field (mathematics)|fields]], as well as points in [[effective Polish space]]s, can be represented as sets of natural numbers, and modulo this representation can be studied in second-order arithmetic.

Reverse mathematics makes use of several subsystems of second-order arithmetic. A typical reverse mathematics theorem shows that a particular mathematical theorem ''T'' is equivalent to a particular subsystem ''S'' of second-order arithmetic over a weaker subsystem ''B''. This weaker system ''B'' is known as the '''base system''' for the result; in order for the reverse mathematics result to have
meaning, this system must not itself be able to prove the mathematical theorem ''T''.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

{{harvtxt|Simpson|2009}} describes five particular subsystems of second-order arithmetic, which he calls the '''Big Five''', that occur frequently in reverse mathematics. In order of increasing strength, these systems are named by the initialisms RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ATR&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and
Π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

The subscript &lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in these names means that the induction scheme has been restricted from the full second-order induction scheme {{harv|Simpson|2009|loc=p. 6}}. For example, ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; includes the induction axiom (0&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;∀''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''))&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∀''n''&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;X. This together with the full comprehension axiom of second-order arithmetic  implies the full second-order induction scheme given by the universal closure of (φ(0) ∧ ∀n(φ(n) → φ(n+1))) → ∀n φ(n) for any second-order formula φ. However ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; does not have the full comprehension axiom, and the subscript &lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a reminder that it does not have the full second-order induction scheme either.  This restriction is important: systems with restricted induction have significantly lower proof-theoretical ordinals than systems with the full second-order induction scheme.

=== The base system RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;===

RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the fragment of second-order arithmetic whose axioms are the axioms of [[Robinson arithmetic]], induction for &amp;Sigma;{{su|p=0|b=1}} formulas, and comprehension for &amp;Delta;{{su|p=0|b=1}} formulas.

The subsystem RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the one most commonly used as a base system for reverse mathematics. The initials "RCA" stand for "recursive comprehension axiom", where "recursive" means "computable", as in [[computable function|recursive function]].  This name is used because RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds informally to "computable mathematics". In particular, any set of natural numbers that can be proven to exist in RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is computable, and thus any theorem which implies that noncomputable sets exist is not provable in RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. To this extent, RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a constructive system, although it does not meet the requirements of the program of [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]] because it is a theory in classical logic including the law of excluded middle.

Despite its seeming weakness (of not proving any noncomputable sets exist), RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is sufficient to prove a number of classical theorems which, therefore, require only minimal logical strength. These theorems are, in a sense, below the reach of the reverse mathematics enterprise because they are already provable in the base system. The classical theorems provable in RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; include:
* Basic properties of the natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers (for example, that the latter form an [[ordered field]]).
* Basic properties of the real numbers (the real numbers are an [[Archimedean property|Archimedean]] ordered field; any [[nested sequence of closed intervals]] whose lengths tend to zero has a single point in its intersection; the real numbers are not countable).
* The [[Baire category theorem]] for a [[complete metric space|complete]] [[separable space|separable]] [[metric space]] (the separability condition is necessary to even state the theorem in the language of second-order arithmetic).
* The [[intermediate value theorem]] on continuous real functions.
* The [[Banach–Steinhaus theorem]] for a sequence of continuous linear operators on separable Banach spaces.
* A weak version of [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] (for a set of sentences, in a countable language, that is already closed under consequence).
* The existence of an [[algebraic closure]] for a countable field (but not its uniqueness).
* The existence and uniqueness of the [[Real closed field|real closure]] of a countable ordered field.

The first-order part of RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (the theorems of the system that do not involve any set variables) is the set of theorems of first-order Peano arithmetic with induction limited to Σ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; formulas.  It is provably consistent, as is RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, in full first-order Peano arithmetic.

=== Weak Kőnig's lemma WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;===

The subsystem WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; consists of RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; plus a weak form of [[Kőnig's lemma]], namely the statement that every infinite subtree of the full binary tree (the tree of all finite sequences of 0's and 1's) has an infinite path. This proposition, which is known as ''weak Kőnig's lemma'', is easy to state in the language of second-order arithmetic. WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can also be defined as the principle of Σ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; separation (given two Σ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; formulas of a free variable ''n'' which are exclusive, there is a class containing all ''n'' satisfying the one and no ''n'' satisfying the other).

The following remark on terminology is in order.  The term “weak Kőnig's lemma” refers to the sentence which says that any infinite subtree of the binary tree has an infinite path.  When this axiom is added to RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the resulting subsystem is called WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. A similar distinction between particular axioms, on the one hand, and subsystems including the basic axioms and induction, on the other hand, is made for the stronger subsystems described below.

In a sense, weak Kőnig's lemma is a form of the [[axiom of choice]] (although, as stated, it can be proven in classical Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice).  It is not constructively valid in some senses of the word constructive.

To show that WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is actually stronger than (not provable in) RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, it is sufficient to exhibit a theorem of WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; which implies that noncomputable sets exist. This is not difficult; WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; implies the existence of separating sets for effectively inseparable recursively enumerable sets.

It turns out that RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; have the same first-order part, meaning that they prove the same first-order sentences.  WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can prove a good number of classical mathematical results which do not follow from RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, however.  These results are not expressible as first-order statements but can be expressed as second-order statements.

The following results are equivalent to weak Kőnig's lemma and thus to WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; over RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:

* The [[Heine–Borel theorem]] for the closed unit real interval, in the following sense: every covering by a sequence of open intervals has a finite subcovering.
* The Heine–Borel theorem for complete totally bounded separable metric spaces (where covering is by a sequence of open balls).
* A continuous real function on the closed unit interval (or on any compact separable metric space, as above) is bounded (or: bounded and reaches its bounds).
* A continuous real function on the closed unit interval can be uniformly approximated by polynomials (with rational coefficients).
* A continuous real function on the closed unit interval is uniformly continuous.
* A continuous real function on the closed unit interval is [[Riemann integral|Riemann]] integrable.
* The [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]] (for continuous functions on a finite product of copies of the closed unit interval).
* The separable [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] in the form: a bounded linear form on a subspace of a separable Banach space extends to a bounded linear form on the whole space.
* The [[Jordan curve theorem]]
* Gödel's completeness theorem (for a countable language).
* Determinacy for open (or even clopen) games on {0,1} of length ω.
* Every countable [[commutative ring]] has a [[prime ideal]].
* Every countable formally real field is orderable.
* Uniqueness of algebraic closure (for a countable field).

=== Arithmetical comprehension ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;===

ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; plus the comprehension scheme for arithmetical formulas (which is sometimes called the "arithmetical comprehension axiom"). That is, ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; allows us to form the set of natural numbers satisfying an arbitrary arithmetical formula (one with no bound set variables, although possibly containing set parameters). Actually, it suffices to add to RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the comprehension scheme for Σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; formulas in order to obtain full arithmetical comprehension.

The first-order part of ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is exactly first-order Peano arithmetic; ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a ''conservative'' extension of first-order Peano arithmetic.  The two systems are provably (in a weak system) equiconsistent.  ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be thought of as a framework of [[Impredicativity|predicative]] mathematics, although there are predicatively provable theorems that are not provable in ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Most of the fundamental results about the natural numbers, and many other mathematical theorems, can be proven in this system.

One way of seeing that ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is stronger than WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is to exhibit a model of WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; that doesn't contain all arithmetical sets. In fact, it is possible to build a model of WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; consisting entirely of [[Low (computability)|low sets]] using the [[low basis theorem]], since low sets relative to low sets are low.

The following assertions are equivalent to ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
over RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:
* The sequential completeness of the real numbers (every bounded increasing sequence of real numbers has a limit).
* The [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]].
* [[Ascoli's theorem]]: every bounded equicontinuous sequence of real functions on the unit interval has a uniformly convergent subsequence.
* Every countable commutative ring has a [[maximal ideal]].
* Every countable vector space over the rationals (or over any countable field) has a basis.
* Every countable field has a [[transcendence basis]].
* Kőnig's lemma (for arbitrary finitely branching trees, as opposed to the weak version described above).
* Various theorems in combinatorics, such as certain forms of [[Ramsey's theorem]].

=== Arithmetical transfinite recursion ATR&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;===

The system ATR&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; adds to ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; an axiom which states, informally, that any arithmetical functional (meaning any arithmetical formula with a free number variable ''n'' and a free class variable ''X'', seen as the operator taking ''X'' to the set of ''n'' satisfying the formula) can be iterated transfinitely along any countable [[well ordering]] starting with any set.  ATR&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent over ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to the principle of Σ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; separation. ATR&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is impredicative, and has the proof-theoretic ordinal &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_0&lt;/math&gt;, the supremum of that of predicative systems.

ATR&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; proves the consistency of ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and thus by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]] it is strictly stronger.

The following assertions are equivalent to
ATR&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; over RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:
* Any two countable well orderings are comparable. That is, they are isomorphic or one is isomorphic to a proper initial segment of the other.
* [[Ulm's theorem]] for countable reduced Abelian groups.
* The [[perfect set property|perfect set theorem]], which states that every uncountable closed subset of a complete separable metric space contains a perfect closed set.
* [[Lusin's separation theorem]] (essentially Σ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; separation).
* [[Determinacy]] for [[open set]]s in the [[Baire space]].

=== Π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; comprehension Π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;===

Π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is stronger than arithmetical transfinite recursion and is fully impredicative. It consists of RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; plus the comprehension scheme for Π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; formulas.

In a sense, Π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; comprehension is to arithmetical transfinite recursion (Σ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; separation) as ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is to weak Kőnig's lemma (Σ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; separation).   It is equivalent to several statements of descriptive set theory whose proofs make use of strongly impredicative arguments; this equivalence shows that these impredicative arguments cannot be removed.

The following theorems are equivalent to Π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;  over RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:
* The [[Cantor–Bendixson theorem]] (every closed set of reals is the union of a perfect set and a countable set).
* Every countable abelian group is the direct sum of a divisible group and a reduced group.

== Additional systems ==

* Weaker systems than recursive comprehension can be defined.  The weak system RCA{{su|p=*|b=0}} consists of [[elementary function arithmetic]] EFA (the basic axioms plus Δ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; induction in the enriched language with an exponential operation) plus Δ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; comprehension. Over RCA{{su|p=*|b=0}},  recursive comprehension as defined earlier (that is, with Σ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; induction) is equivalent to the statement that a polynomial (over a countable field) has only finitely many roots and to the classification theorem for finitely generated Abelian groups. The system RCA{{su|p=*|b=0}} has the same proof theoretic ordinal &amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; as EFA and is conservative over EFA for &amp;Pi;{{su|p=0|b=2}} sentences.
* Weak Weak Kőnig's Lemma is the statement that a subtree of the infinite binary tree having no infinite paths has an asymptotically vanishing proportion of the leaves at length ''n'' (with a uniform estimate as to how many leaves of length ''n'' exist).   An equivalent formulation is that any subset of Cantor space that has positive measure is nonempty (this is not provable in RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). WWKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is obtained by adjoining this axiom to RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is equivalent to the statement that if the unit real interval is covered by a sequence of intervals then the sum of their lengths is at least one.  The model theory of WWKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is closely connected to the theory of [[algorithmically random sequence]]s.  In particular, an ω-model of RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies weak weak Kőnig's lemma if and only if for every set ''X'' there is a set ''Y'' which is 1-random relative to ''X''.
* DNR (short for "diagonally non-recursive") adds to RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; an axiom asserting the existence of a [[Kleene's recursion theorem#Fixed point free functions|diagonally non-recursive]] function relative to every set. That is, DNR states that, for any set ''A'', there exists a total function ''f'' such that for all ''e'' the ''e''th partial recursive function with oracle ''A'' is not equal to ''f''. DNR is strictly weaker than WWKL (Lempp ''et al.'', 2004).
* Δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-comprehension is in certain ways analogous to arithmetical transfinite recursion as recursive comprehension is to weak Kőnig's lemma.  It has the hyperarithmetical sets as minimal ω-model.  Arithmetical transfinite recursion proves Δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-comprehension but not the other way around.
* Σ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-choice is the statement that if η(''n'',''X'') is a Σ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; formula such that for each ''n'' there exists an ''X'' satisfying η then there is a sequence of sets ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that η(''n'',''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') holds for each ''n''.  Σ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-choice also has the hyperarithmetical sets as minimal ω-model.  Arithmetical transfinite recursion proves Σ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-0.6em"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-choice but not the other way around.
* HBU (short for "uncountable Heine-Borel") expresses the (open-cover) [[compactness]] of the unit interval, involving ''uncountable covers''.  The latter aspect of HBU makes it only expressible in the language of ''third-order'' arithmetic.  [[Cousin's theorem]] (1895) implies HBU, and these theorems use the same notion of cover due to [[Cousin]] and [[Lindelöf]].  HBU is ''hard'' to prove: in terms of the usual hierarchy of comprehension axioms, a proof of HBU requires full second-order arithmetic ({{harvtxt|Normann-Sanders|2018}}).

==&amp;omega;-models and &amp;beta;-models==

The &amp;omega; in &amp;omega;-model stands for the set of non-negative integers (or finite ordinals). An &amp;omega;-model is a model for a fragment of second-order arithmetic  whose first-order part is the standard model of Peano arithmetic, but whose second-order part may be non-standard. More precisely, an &amp;omega;-model is given by a choice ''S''&amp;sube;2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt; of subsets of &amp;omega;. The first-order variables are interpreted in the usual way as elements of &amp;omega;, and +, &amp;times; have their usual meanings, while second-order variables are interpreted as elements of ''S''.  There is a standard &amp;omega; model where one just takes ''S'' to consist of all subsets of the integers. However, there are also other &amp;omega;-models; for example, RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; has a minimal &amp;omega;-model where ''S'' consists of the recursive subsets of &amp;omega;.

A &amp;beta; model is an &amp;omega; model that is equivalent to the standard &amp;omega;-model for &amp;Pi;{{su|p=1|b=1}} and &amp;Sigma;{{su|p=1|b=1}} sentences (with parameters).

Non-&amp;omega; models are also useful, especially in the proofs of conservation theorems.

'''''Power of Art''''' is a [[BBC]] documentary series written and presented by [[Simon Schama]]. The series was broadcast in October and November 2006 on [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. It aired in [[Poland]] on [[TVP2]] in February and March 2008, on [[PBS]] in the US and  re -broadcast in September 2008 on [[TVOntario]] in Canada, [[ABC1]] in Australia, [[Australia Network]] in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, [[TV One (New Zealand)|TV ONE]] in [[New Zealand]] and on [[ET1 (Greece)|ET1]] in [[Greece]]. It was also translated to Persian and aired on [[BBC Persian]] in Iran, as well in [[Italy]] for [[Sky Italia]] on the channel Sky Arte. Each of the eight one-hour episodes examines the biography of an artist and one of his key works through Schama's considerations and occasional reenactments:

# [[Caravaggio]] – ''[[David with the Head of Goliath (Caravaggio, Rome)|David with the Head of Goliath]]'' (c. 1610)
# [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] – ''[[Ecstasy of Saint Teresa]]'' (1657)
# [[Rembrandt]] – ''[[The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis]]'' (1662)
# [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] – ''[[The Death of Marat]]'' (1793)
# [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] – ''[[The Slave Ship]]'' (1840)
# [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] – ''[[Wheatfield with Crows]]'' (1890)
# [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] – ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (1937)
# [[Mark Rothko|Rothko]] – ''[[Black on Maroon]]'' (1958)

In reenactment scenes the role of Caravaggio was performed by [[Paul Popplewell]], Van Gogh was played by [[Andy Serkis]], and Mark Rothko by [[Allan Corduner]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10062">The '''Social Support Questionnaire''' (SSQ) is a quantitative, psychometrically sound survey questionnaire intended to measure social support and satisfaction with said social support from the perspective of the interviewee.&lt;ref name="Social Support Questionnaire"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fetzer.org/sites/default/files/images/stories/pdf/selfmeasures/Self_Measures_for_Love_and_Compassion_Research_SOCIAL_SUPPORT.pdf|title=Social Support Questionnaire|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407587044007|title=A Brief Measure of Social Support: Practical and Theoretical Implications|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1177/0265407587044007|volume=4|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|pages=497–510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Degree of [[social support]] has been shown to influence the onset and course of certain psychiatric disorders such as [[clinical depression]] or [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.institute-of-mental-health.jp/thesis/pdf/thesis-04/thesis-04-32.pdf|title=Social Support Questionnaire among psychiatric patients with various diagnoses and normal controls|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SSQ was approved for public release in 1981 by Irwin Sarason, Henry Levine, Robert Basham and Barbara Sarason under the University of Washington Department of Psychology and consists of 27 questions.&lt;ref name="ADA100464"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA100464|title=ADA100464|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the SSQ has good test-retest reliability and convergent internal construct validity.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ADA100464" /&gt;

==Overview==
The questionnaire is designed so that each question has a two-part answer. The first part asks the interviewee to list up to nine people available to provide support that meet the criteria stated in the question. These support individuals are specified using their initials in addition to the relationship to the interviewee.&lt;ref name="BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://instruct.uwo.ca/kinesiology/9641/Assessments/Social/SSQ.html|title=BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly - Assessment Summary Sheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Example questions from the first part includes questions such as “Whom could you count on to help if you had just been fired from your job or expelled from school?” and “Whom do you feel would help if a family member very close to you died?”.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt;

The second part asks the interviewee to specify how satisfied they are with each of the people stated in the first part. The SSQ respondents use a 6 -point [[Likert scale]] to indicate their degree of satisfaction with the support from the above people ranging from “1 - very dissatisfied” to “6 - very satisfied”.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt;

The Social Support Questionnaire has multiple short forms such as the SSQ3 and the SSQ6.

==History of the SSQ==
The SSQ is based on 4 original studies. The first study set out to determine whether the SSQ had the desired psychometric properties. The second study tried to relate SSQ and a diversity of personality measures such as [[anxiety]], depression and hostility in connection with the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist. The third study considered the relationship between social support, the prior year’s negative and positive life events, internal-external locus of control and self- esteem in conjunction with the Life Experiences Survey. The fourth study tested the idea that social support could serve as a buffer when faced with difficult life situations via trying to solve a maze and subsequently completing the Cognitive Interference Questionnaire.&lt;ref name="ADA100464" /&gt;

==Scoring==
The overall support score (SSQN) is calculated by taking an average of the individual scores across the 27 items.&lt;ref name="BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly" /&gt; A high score on the SSQ indicates more optimism about life than a low score. Respondents with low SSQ scores have a higher prevalence of negative life events and illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarason|first=|year=1985|title=Concomitants of Social Support: Social Skills, Physical Attractiveness and Gender|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA141884|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=49|pages=469–480|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.49.2.469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scoring is as follows:

1. Add the total number of people for all 27 items (questions). (Max. is 243). Divide by 27 for average item score. This gives you SSQ Number Score, or SSQN.

2. Add the total satisfaction scores for all 27 items (questions). (Max is 162). Divide by 27 for average item score. This gives you SSQ Satisfaction score or SSQS.

3. Finally, you can average the above for  the total number of people that are family members - this results in the SSQ family score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agedcaretests.com/The_Social_Support_Questionnaire_(SSQ)_SAMPLE.pdf|title=Social Support Questionnaire Sample|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliability==
According to Sarason, the SSQ takes between fifteen to eighteen minutes to properly administer and has “good” test-retest reliability.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt;

==Validity==
The SSQ was compared with the depression scale and validity tests show significant negative correlation ranging from -0.22 to -0.43. The SSQ and the optimism scale have a correlation of 0.57. The SSQ and the satisfaction score have a correlation of 0.34.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt; The SSQ has high [[internal consistency]] among items.&lt;ref name="ADA100464" /&gt;

==Related Surveys==

=== SSQ3 ===

The SSQ3 is a short form of the SSQ and has only three questions. The SSQ3 has acceptable test-test reliability and correlation with personality variables as compared to the long form of the Social Support Questionnaire. The internal reliability was borderline but this low level of internal reliability is as expected since there are only three questions.&lt;ref name="Social Support Questionnaire" /&gt;

=== SSQ6 ===

The SSQ6 is a short form of the SSQ. The SSQ6 has been shown to have high correlation with: the SSQ, SSQ personality variables and internal reliability. In the development of the SSQ6, the research suggests that professed social support in adults may be a connected to “early attachment experience.”&lt;ref name="Social Support Questionnaire" /&gt; The SSQ6 consists of the below 6 questions:

1. Whom can you really count on to be dependable when you need help?

2. Whom can you really count on to help you feel more relaxed when you are under pressure or tense?

3. Who accepts you totally, including both your worst and your best points?

4. Whom can you really count on to care about you, regardless of what is happening to you?

5. Whom can you really count on to help you feel better when you are feeling generally down-in-the-dumps?

6. Whom can you count on to console you when you are very upset?&lt;ref name="BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly" /&gt;

===Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL)===

The Interpersonal Support Evaluation List includes 40 items (questions) with four sub-scales in the areas of Tangible Support, Belonging Support, Self-Esteem Support and Appraisal Support. The interviewee rates each item based on how true or false they feel the item is for themselves. The four total response options are “Definitely True”, “Probably True”, “Probably False”, and “Definitely False”.&lt;ref name="Social Support Questionnaire" /&gt;

'''Terrain Contour Matching''', or '''TERCOM''', is a navigation system used primarily by [[cruise missile]]s. It uses a pre-recorded [[Contour line|contour map]] of the terrain that is compared with measurements made during flight by an on-board [[radar altimeter]]. A TERCOM system considerably increases the accuracy of a missile compared with [[inertial navigation system]]s (INS). The increased accuracy allows a TERCOM-equipped missile to fly closer to obstacles and generally lower altitudes, making it harder to detect by ground radar.

== Description ==
{{See also|Digital elevation model}}

===Optical contour matching===
The [[Goodyear Aerospace|Goodyear Aircraft Corporation]] ATRAN (Automatic Terrain Recognition And Navigation) system for the [[MGM-13 Mace]] was the earliest known TERCOM system. In August 1952, [[Air Materiel Command]] initiated the mating of the Goodyear ATRAN with the [[MGM-1 Matador]].  This mating resulted in a production contract in June 1954. ATRAN was difficult to jam and was not range-limited by line-of sight, but its range was restricted by the availability of radar maps. In time, it became possible to construct radar maps from [[topographic map]]s.

Preparation of the maps required the route to be flown by an aircraft. A [[radar]] on the aircraft was set to a fixed angle and made horizontal scans of the land in front. The timing of the return signal indicated the range to the landform and produced an [[amplitude modulated]] (AM) signal. This was sent to a light source and recorded on [[35 mm film]], advancing the film and taking a picture at indicated times. The film could then be processed and copied for use in multiple missiles.

In the missile, a similar radar produced the same signal. A second system scanned the frames of film against a [[photocell]] and produced a similar AM signal. By comparing the points along the scan where the brightness changed rapidly, which could be picked out easily by simple electronics, the system could compare the left-right path of the missile compared with that of the pathfinding aircraft. Errors between the two signals drove corrections in the autopilot needed to bring the missile back onto its programmed flight path.

===Altitude matching===
Modern TERCOM systems use a different concept, based on the altitude of the ground the missile files over and comparing that to measurements made by a radar altimeter. TERCOM "maps" consist of a series of squares of a given size. Using a smaller number of squares saves memory, at the cost of decreasing accuracy. A series of such maps are produced, typically from data from radar mapping satellites. When flying over water, contour maps are replaced by magnetic field maps.

As a radar altimeter measures the distance between the missile and the terrain, not the absolute altitude, the important measure in the data is the change in altitude from square to square. The missile's radar altimeter feeds measurements into a small buffer which periodically "gates" the measurements over a period of time and averages them out to produce a single measurement. The series of such numbers held in the buffer produce a strip of measurements similar to those held in the maps. The series of changes in the buffer is then compared with the values in the map, looking for areas where the changes in altitude are identical. This produces a location and direction. The guidance system can then use this information to correct the flight path of the missile. 

During the flight to the target the accuracy of the system has to be enough only to avoid terrain features. This allows the maps to be relatively low resolution in these areas. Only the portion of the map for the terminal approach has to be higher resolution, and would normally be encoded at the highest resolutions available to the satellite mapping system.

=== TAINS ===

Due to the limited amount of memory available in mass storage devices of the 1960s and 70s, and their slow access times, the amount of terrain data that could be stored in a missile-sized package was far too small to encompass the entire flight. Instead, small patches of terrain information were stored and periodically used to update a conventional [[inertial platform]]. These systems, combining TERCOM and inertial navigation, are sometimes known as '''TAINS''', for TERCOM-Aided Inertial Navigation System.

=== Advantages ===

TERCOM systems have the advantage of offering accuracy that is not based on the length of the flight; an inertial system slowly drifts after a "fix", and its accuracy is lower for longer distances. TERCOM systems receive constant fixes during the flight, and thus do not have any drift. Their absolute accuracy, however, is based on the accuracy of the radar mapping information, which is typically in the range of meters, and the ability of the processor to compare the altimeter data to the map quickly enough as the resolution increases. This generally limits first generation TERCOM systems to targets on the order of hundreds of meters, limiting them to the use of [[nuclear warhead]]s. Use of conventional warheads requires further accuracy, which in turn demands additional terminal guidance systems.

=== Disadvantages ===

One disadvantage of early TERCOM systems was that, due to the limitations of storage and computing systems of the time, the entire route had to be pre-planned, including its launch point. If the missile was launched from an unexpected location or flew too far off-course, it would never fly over the features included in the maps, and become lost. The INS system can help in this regard, allowing it to fly to the general area of the first patch, but gross errors simply cannot be corrected. This made early TERCOM based systems much less flexible than more modern systems like [[GPS]], which can be set to attack any location from any location, and do not require any sort of pre-recorded information which means they can be targeted immediately prior to launch.

The availability of compact fast computers and high-capacity storage, combined with the availability of global [[digital elevation map]]s, has mitigated this problem, as TERCOM data is no longer limited to small patches, and the availability of [[side-looking radar]] allows much larger areas of landscape contour data to be acquired for comparison with the stored contour data.

== Comparison with other guidance systems ==
=== DSMAC ===
{{See also|Automatic target recognition}}
Early cruise missiles did not have the mapping satellites to draw information from, and there were plans to use a TERCOM-like system based on photographs rather than elevations. A series of photographs taken from surveillance aircraft were put into a carousel in the missile, which were selected at timed intervals and imaged using a television camera. Another camera took pictures out of the bottom of the missile, imaged onto a similar display. A computer compared the two displays and attempted to line up areas of high contrast, similar to the [[contrast seeker]]s used in the [[Maverick missile]], and the offsets needed to align the two images could be decoded into a location and heading. However, this system proved to be very slow, and no such system was ever employed operationally, its role being taken up by TERCOM.

The massive improvements in memory and processing power from the 1950s when these scene comparison systems were first invented to the 1980s when TERCOM was widely deployed changed the nature of the problem considerably. Modern systems can store numerous images of a target as seen from different directions, and often the imagery can be calculated using image synthesis techniques. Likewise, the complexity of the live imaging systems has been greatly reduced through the introduction of solid-state technologies like [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]]. The combination of these technologies produced the '''Digitized Scene-Mapping Area Correlator (DSMAC)'''. DSMAC systems are often combined with TERCOM as a terminal guidance system, allowing point attack with conventional warheads.
{{Main article|Radar imaging}}
MGM-31 [[Pershing II]], [[SS-12 Scaleboard]] Temp-SM and [[OTR-23 Oka]] used an [[active radar homing]] version of DSMAC (digitized correlator unit DCU), which compared radar [[topographic map]]s taken by satellites or aircraft with information received from the onboard active radar regarding target topography, for terminal guidance.

=== Satellite navigation ===
Yet another way to navigate a cruise missile is by using a '''[[satellite positioning system]]''', such as [[GPS]] or [[GLONASS]]. Satellite navigation systems are precise and cheap. Unfortunately, they rely on satellites. If the satellites are interfered with (e.g. destroyed) or if the satellite signal is interfered with (e.g. jammed), the satellite navigation system becomes inoperable. Therefore, the GPS-based (or GLONASS-based) navigation is useful in a conflict with a technologically unsophisticated adversary. On the other hand, to be ready for a conflict with a technologically advanced adversary, one needs missiles equipped with TAINS and DSMAC.

A '''time crystal''' or '''space-time crystal''' is a structure that repeats in [[time]], as well as in [[space]]. Normal three-dimensional  [[crystal]]s have a repeating pattern in space, but remain unchanged as time passes. Time crystals repeat themselves in time as well, leading the crystal to change from moment to moment. A time crystal never reaches [[thermal equilibrium]], as it is a type of non-equilibrium matter, a form of matter proposed in 2012, and first observed in 2017. This state of matter cannot be isolated from its environment{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}—it is an open system in [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|non-equilibrium]].

The idea of a time crystal was first described by [[Nobel laureate]] and [[MIT]] professor [[Frank Wilczek]] in 2012. Later work developed a more precise definition for time crystals. It was proven that they cannot exist in equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Watanabe|Oshikawa|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 2014 Krzysztof Sacha at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krakow]] predicted the behaviour of discrete time crystals in a periodically-driven many-body system.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Sacha|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Norman Yao et al. at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] proposed a different way to create time crystals in spin systems. From there, [[Christopher Monroe]] and [[Mikhail Lukin]] independently confirmed this in their labs. Both experiments were published in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] in 2017.

==History==
[[File:Frank Wilczek.jpg|thumb|[[Nobel laureate]] [[Frank Wilczek]] at [[University of Paris-Saclay]]]]
The idea of a space-time crystal was first put forward by [[Frank Wilczek]], a professor at [[MIT]] and [[Nobel laureate]], in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Wilczek|2012}} and {{harvp|Shapere|Wilczek|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Xiang Zhang, a nanoengineer at [[University of California, Berkeley]], and his team proposed creating a time crystal in the form of a constantly rotating ring of charged ions.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvs|txt|last1=Li et al.|year1=2012a|year2=2012b}}, Wolchover 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Wilczek and Zhang, Patrick Bruno, a theorist at the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] in [[Grenoble]], France, published several papers in 2013 claiming to show that space-time crystals were impossible. Also later Masaki Oshikawa from the University of Tokyo showed that time crystals would be impossible at their ground state; moreover, he implied that any matter cannot exist in non-equilibrium in its ground state.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Bruno|2013a}} and {{harvp|Bruno|2013b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Thomas|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent work developed more precise definitions of [[time translation symmetry]]-breaking which ultimately led to a [[No-go theorem|'no-go' proof]] that quantum time crystals in equilibrium are not possible.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Nozières|2013}}, {{harvp|Yao et al.|2017|p=1}} and {{harvp|Volovik|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Watanabe|Oshikawa|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several realizations of time crystals, which avoid the equilibrium no-go arguments, were later proposed.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Wilczek|2013b}} and {{harvp|Yoshii et al.|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krzysztof Sacha at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krakow]] predicted the behaviour of discrete time crystals in a periodically driven system of ultracold atoms.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Sacha|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later works&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Khemani et al.|2016}} and {{harvp|Else et al.|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested periodically driven quantum spin systems could show similar behaviour.

Norman Yao at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] studied a different model of time crystals.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Yao et al.|2017}}, {{Harvp|Richerme|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His blueprint was successfully used by two teams: a group led by [[Harvard university|Harvard]]'s [[Mikhail Lukin]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;See {{harvp|Choi et al.|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a group led by [[Christopher Monroe]] at [[University of Maryland]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;See {{harvp|Zhang et al.|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time translation symmetry==
{{main article|Time translation symmetry}}
Symmetries in nature lead directly to conservation laws, something which is precisely formulated by the [[Noether theorem]].{{sfn|Cao|2004|p=151}}

The basic idea of ''time-translation symmetry'' is that a translation in time has no effect on physical laws, i.e. that the laws of nature that apply today were the same in the past and will be the same in the future.{{sfn|Wilczek|2015|loc=chpt. 3}} This symmetry implies the [[conservation of energy]].{{sfn|Feng|Jin|2005|p=18}}

===Broken symmetry in normal crystals===
{{main article|Crystal symmetry|spontaneous symmetry breaking}}
[[Image:Phonon nu process.svg|thumb|right|250px|Figure 2. Normal process (N-process) and Umklapp process (U-process). While the N-process conserves total [[phonon]] momentum, the U-process changes phonon momentum.]] Normal crystals exhibit ''broken translation symmetry'':  they have repeated patterns in space, and are not invariant under arbitrary translations or rotations. The laws of physics are unchanged by arbitrary translations and rotations. However, if we hold fixed the atoms of a crystal, the dynamics of electrons or other particles in the crystal depends on how it moves relative to the crystal, and particles' momentum can change by interacting with the atoms of a crystal — for example in [[Umklapp process]]es.{{sfn|Sólyom|2007|p=193}} [[Quasimomentum]], however, is conserved in a perfect crystal.{{sfn|Sólyom|2007|p=191}}

===Broken symmetry in time crystals===
Time crystals seem to break ''time-translation symmetry,'' and have repeated patterns in time. Fields or particles may change their energy by interacting with a time crystal, just as they can change their momentum by interacting with a spatial crystal.

==Thermodynamics==
Time crystals do not violate the laws of thermodynamics: energy in the overall system is conserved, such a crystal does not spontaneously convert thermal energy into mechanical work, and it cannot serve as a perpetual store of work.  But it may change perpetually in a fixed pattern in time for as long as the system can be maintained. They possess "motion without energy"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/time-crystals-might-exist-after-all-and-they-could-break-the-symmetry-of-space-and-time|title=Time Crystals Might Exist After All - And They Could Break Space-Time Symmetry|last=Crew|first=Bec|work=ScienceAlert|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;—their apparent motion does not represent conventional kinetic energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-crystals-could-be-legitimate-form-perpetual-motion/|title="Time Crystals" Could Be a Legitimate Form of Perpetual Motion - Scie…|date=2017-02-02|work=archive.is|access-date=2017-09-21|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20170202101455/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-crystals-could-be-legitimate-form-perpetual-motion/|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proven that a time crystal cannot exist in thermal equilibrium.  Recent years have seen more studies of non-equilibrium quantum fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Esposito et al.|2009}} and {{harvp|Campisi et al.|2011}} for academic review articles on non-equilibrium quantum fluctuations&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments==
In October 2016, Christopher Monroe at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] claimed to have created the world's first discrete time crystal. Using the idea from Yao's proposal, his team trapped a chain of [[Ytterbium-171|&lt;sup&gt;171&lt;/sup&gt;Yb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ([[ytterbium]]) ions in a [[Paul trap]], confined by radio frequency electromagnetic fields. One of the two [[Spin quantum number|spin states]] was selected by a pair of laser beams. The lasers were pulsed, with the shape of the pulse controlled by an [[acousto-optic modulator]], using the [[Tukey window]] to avoid too much energy at the wrong optical frequency. The [[hyperfine]] electron states in that setup, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; |F=0, m&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 0⟩ and |F = 1, m&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 0⟩, have very close energy levels, separated by 12.642831&amp;nbsp;GHz. Ten [[Doppler cooling|Doppler-cooled]] ions were placed in a line 0.025&amp;nbsp;mm long and coupled together.

The researchers observed a subharmonic oscillation of the drive. The experiment showed "rigidity" of the time crystal, where the oscillation frequency remained unchanged even when the time crystal was perturbed, and that it gained a frequency of its own and vibrated according to it (rather than only the frequency of the drive). However, once the perturbation or frequency of vibration grew too strong, the time crystal "melted" and lost this subharmonic oscillation, and it returned to the same state as before where it moved only with the induced frequency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Later in 2016, [[Mikhail Lukin]] at Harvard also reported the creation of a driven time crystal. His group used a [[diamond]] crystal doped with a high concentration of [[nitrogen-vacancy center]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, which have strong dipole-dipole coupling and relatively long-lived spin [[Coherence (physics)#Quantum coherence|coherence]]. This strongly-interacting dipolar spin system was driven with microwave fields, and the ensemble spin state with an optical (laser) field was determine. It was observed that the spin polarization evolved at half the frequency of the microwave drive. The oscillations persisted for over 100 cycles. This [[Subharmonic function|subharmonic]] response to the drive frequency is seen as a signature of time-crystalline order.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3121">'''Transformative arts''' is the use of artistic activities, such as [[Storytelling|story-telling]], [[painting]], and [[Musical composition|music-making]], to precipitate constructive individual and social change.

The individual changes effected through transformative arts are commonly [[Cognition|cognitive]] and [[Emotion|emotional]]. This results from the way participation in a [[Creativity|creative process]] and pursuit of an artistic practice can promote a critical re-evaluation of previously held [[Belief|beliefs]], accompanied by unfamiliar [[Feeling|feelings]], which alters [[Social perception|perception]] of the world, oneself, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Preminger, S., 2012. Transformative art: art as means for long-term neurocognitive change. Frontiers in human neuroscience, 6, p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social changes effected through transformative arts occurs when this altered perception manifests in new ways of interacting with others.&lt;ref&gt;Vail, J. and Hollands, R., 2013. Creative democracy and the arts: The participatory democracy of the Amber Collective. Cultural Sociology, 7(3), pp.352-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although engagement in artistic activities has been integral to the means by which individuals and communities have sought [[Comfort|personal comfort]], [[Self-reflection|self-reflection]], and [[Group cohesiveness|group cohesion]] for thousands of years, the origin of transformative arts as a modern formal concept is commonly attributed to the work of [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldblatt, P., 2006. How John Dewey's theories underpin art and art education. Education and culture, pp.17-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey espoused four main ideas around which transformative arts pivot. Firstly, art is not an object but an experience, in which one or more persons participate. Secondly, every individual is potentially an artist by way of his or her capacity to participate in this experience, through any artistic activity. Thirdly, such participation inevitably precipitates some kind of transformative change to how the participants think, feel, and [[behave]]. Fourthly, art is therefore both psychological and social, transforming not only individual intrapersonal processes, but also interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;John, D., 1934. Art as experience. New York: Minton, Balch, and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, transformative arts are facilitated by artists with the psychological purpose of promoting individual [[introspection]],&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, S.L. and Myers, C.E. eds., 2015. Therapists Creating a Cultural Tapestry: Using the Creative Therapies Across Cultures. Charles C Thomas Publisher.&lt;/ref&gt; and with the social purpose of promoting [[Social_exclusion#Social_inclusion|inclusion]], [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], and [[social justice|justice]].&lt;ref&gt;LeBaron, M. and Sarra, J. eds., 2018. Changing Our Worlds: Arts as Transformative Practice (Vol. 12). AFRICAN SUN MeDIA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In applied mathematics, '''Wahba's problem''', first posed by [[Grace Wahba]] in 1965, seeks to find a [[rotation matrix]] ([[Orthogonal matrix|special orthogonal matrix]]) between two coordinate systems from a set of (weighted) vector observations. Solutions to Wahba's problem are often used in [[satellite]] [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|attitude determination]] utilising sensors such as [[magnetometer]]s and multi-antenna [[Global Positioning System|GPS receivers]]. The cost function that Wahba's problem seeks to minimise is as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;J(\mathbf{R}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k\| \mathbf{w}_k - \mathbf{R} \mathbf{v}_k \|^2 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;N\geq2 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}_k&lt;/math&gt; is the ''k''-th 3-vector measurement in the reference frame, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_k&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding ''k''-th 3-vector measurement in the body frame and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a 3 by 3 rotation matrix between the coordinate frames.&lt;ref&gt;The rotation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; in the problem's definition transforms the body frame to the reference frame. Most publications define rotation in the reverse direction, i.e. from the reference to the body frame which amounts to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^T&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt; is an optional set of weights for each observation.

A number of solutions to the problem have appeared in literature, notably Davenport's q-method, QUEST and [[singular value decomposition]]-based methods.  This is an alternative formulation of the [[Orthogonal Procrustes problem]] (consider all the vectors multiplied by the square-roots of the corresponding weights as columns of two matrices with ''N'' columns to obtain the alternative formulation).

Several methods for solving Wahba's problem are discussed by Markley and Mortari.

== Solution by Singular Value Decomposition ==

One solution can be found using a [[singular value decomposition]] as reported by [http://www.control.auc.dk/~tb/best/aug23-Bak-svdalg.pdf Markley]

1. Obtain a matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \mathbf{w}_i {\mathbf{v}_i}^T&lt;/math&gt;

2. Find the [[singular value decomposition]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{S} \mathbf{V}^T&lt;/math&gt;

3. The rotation matrix is simply:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{M} \mathbf{V}^T&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M} = \operatorname{diag}(\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \det(\mathbf{U}) \det(\mathbf{V})\end{bmatrix})&lt;/math&gt;

The name "'''Whitechapel Boys'''" identifies a loosely-knit group of Anglo-[[Jewish]] writers and artists of the early 20th century.  It is named after [[Whitechapel]], which contained one of London's main Jewish settlements and from which many of its members came.  These members included [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]], [[Isaac Rosenberg]], [[David Bomberg]], [[Joseph Leftwich]], Jacob Kramer, Morris Goldstein, [[Stephen Winsten]], [[John Rodker]], [[Lazarus Aaronson]] and its only female member, [[Clara Birnberg]].&lt;ref name="Dickson&amp;MacDougall"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dickson |first1=Rachel |last2=MacDougall |first2=Sarah |year=2004 |title=The Whitechapel Boys |journal=[[Jewish Quarterly]] |publisher=Routledge |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=29–34 |doi=10.1080/0449010X.2004.10706848}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacDougall |first=Sarah |editor-last1=Walsh |editor-first1=Michael J.

The name is modern, not a contemporary one, originating later in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Dickson&amp;MacDougall"/&gt;

Several of the Whitechapel Boys, such as Rodker, Rosenberg, Leftwich, Winsten and Bomberg, were also politically active and members of the radical [[Young Socialist League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Patterson |first=Ian |editor-last1=Beasley |editor-first1=Rebecca |editor-last2=Bullock |editor-first2=Philip Ross |year=2013 |title=Russia in Britain, 1880-1940: From Melodrama to Modernism |chapter=The Translation of Soviet Literature |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-966086-5 |page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moorcroft Wilson |first=Jean |author-link=Jean Moorcroft Wilson |year=2009 |title=Isaac Rosenberg: The Making of a Great War Poet: A New Life |publisher=Northwestern University Press |edition=U.S. |isbn=978-0-8101-2604-6 |pages=85, 98, 101, 181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3959">'''Wilhelm Bousset''' (3 September 1865, [[Lübeck]] – 8 March 1920, [[Gießen]]) was a German [[theologian]] and [[New Testament]] scholar. He was of [[Huguenot]] ancestry and a native of [[Lübeck]].

==Biography==
He began his studies at the [[University of Erlangen]], where he met [[Ernst Troeltsch]] (1865–1923), with whom he would maintain a friendship that would last throughout his career. Later on, he studied at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], where he was student of [[Adolf von Harnack]] (1851–1930), and afterwards continued his education at the [[University of Göttingen]]. In 1890 he became a professor of [[New Testament]] exegesis at [[Göttingen]], later relocating to the [[University of Giessen]] (1916).

Bousset was a prominent figure in the ''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'' ([[history of religions school]]), a group that included scholars such as [[Richard August Reitzenstein]] (1861–1931), [[Albert Eichhorn]] (1856–1926) and [[Hermann Gunkel]] (1862–1932). His better known work involved comparative studies between the [[Early Christian Church]] and other religious beliefs, particularly [[Hellenistic Judaism]]. Bousset demonstrated in his writings that Christian thought was profoundly influenced by neighboring cultures and belief systems.

== Publications ==
Bousset was a prolific writer, and among his books that were translated into English were ''Kyrios Christos: Geschichte des Christusglaubens von den Anfängen des Christentums bis Irenäus'' (Kyrios Christos; A History of the Belief in [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] from the Beginnings of [[Christianity]] to [[Irenaeus]]), and ''Der Antichrist in Der Uberlieferung Des Judentums, Des Neuen Testaments Und Der Alten Kirche'' ([[Antichrist]] Legend: A Chapter in Christian and Jewish Folklore).
